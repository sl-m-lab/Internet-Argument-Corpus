I simply stated the opinion that standards should be set based on the current needs of a particular type of combat soldier. If a woman cannot meet those standards then she shouldn't be involved in combat because it would jeopardize both her safety and the safety of her unit. However, there is enough bias out there against women in combat that I do not have automatic trust that standards are determined purely based on the realistic expectations of a soldiers performance. If they currently are then great, but that is one thing I would take special care to look at in determining whether a particular standard is reasonable.\n \n Dono brought up his standard that a woman should be able to march 12 miles across the desert with a 60 pound field pack and a nine pound rifle. If that is a reality in combat then, by all means, set that standard. As to whether or not men and women should have the same standard, then I would think yes, as long as the standard is based on realistic expectations.",

I would argue that the mental stress involved in spying is probably greater than in a combat role. Life as a spy is incredibly difficult. You spend your entire life looking over your shoulder, just waiting for that inconsequential slip that gets you killed or captured. I would also argue that women are probably better at this than men. for one, men tend to trust women more easily than other men. The second reason I think they are likely to be better at this is that I have noticed in many wome, even most, they have the ability to go into a kind of \"crisis mode\" as far as tehir mentla processes go. I have seen some pretty tough women come through situations where men were falling apart all around them. \n \n As far as combat, the concern is not so much for the safety of the individual dsoldier as for the safety of the guy next to him. If you can move fairly quickly, and keep moving, you will do fine for yourself in combat (provided you don't loose your head). In combat, though, youa re not just responsible for yourself, you are responsible for the men on either side of you. You need to be able to move quickly and keep moving while you are carrying the guy next to you if need be.\n \n The thing that keeps women out of combat is generally the saem thing that keeps them from being firefighters. Upper body strength. In some cases, women develop the upper body strength required and make fine firefighters. I have even known a couple women who worked int eh private sector as combat soldiers and they were fine at that. Most women, though, do not posess the upper body strength to toss 200 lbs of man and gear on their shoulder and run with them. That is basically the standard that the physiucal requirements for your combat troops are based. \n \n If the physical requirements were exactly the same for them, I don't think tehre would be the argument. As is, they have lightened up the physical requirements for women, which is a poor idea. I don't blame the men for not wanting to serve next to them in dangerous situations if they are not held to the same physical standard. You cannot have an effective combat squad if your people do not have confidence in the man (or woman) next to them.",

In reality, they mean nothing. Individual training officers generally ignore them. Some officers are known for having fairly relaxed requirements, some are known for being rather rigid.

   "From your descriptions, it sounds like combat in the Navy and Air Force, apart from SF units and combat pilots, has low enough physical requirements that many women might be able to fill those rolls. \n\n \n Possibly some psotions, but not most. A large part of Naval combat is firefighting. Everybody on a ship is a firefighter, regardless of other duties. Everybody should check out to the minimum firefighting qualification, and most women simply can't amke the cut. Other primary combat operation shipboard include loading the \"big guns\", transporting missiles to launchers, loading torpedos. All of these are incredibly physically sdemanding and while I think that most women could do it once, maybe twice, there is no way women in general can keep up witht he men who do it all day long at a dead run. Women simply do not have the natural upper body strenght.\n \n I would ratehr see women on the field with the army than onboard a navy ship.\n \n As far as AF, the only combat units the AF has are fighter squadrons, SF units, and bomber squadrons. I think women would make fine bomber pilots/navigators, etc... Unfortunatly, to play on the really cool toys requires that you be a fighter pilot first. \n \n \nAs for a combat pilot, how much physical strength is required in that role? I can imagine that they must be able to take a lot of G-forces, in order to make tight turns. I'm not sure how men and women differ in ability to withstand G-forces, but its certainly possible that there is a large difference. Otherwise, perhaps there are times when simply maneuvering the controls might take physical strength but, with todays computer control and assistance, I'm not sure if that is relevant any more.\n\n \n Maneuvering the controls is nothing. I have never flown a navy fighter, bu t I have flown Army training jets on a couple of occasions, as well as having my own sport/acrobatic plane (you catch a lot more G's in something like that than in a modern jet fighter). \n \n The problem is not the ability to withstand G's and survive, the problem is the ability to withstand G's and not pass out (which, if you happen to be the pilot, kills you). In order to keep from passing out, you flex your muscles as hard as you can to force blood to your brain. We have G suits, but they are most junk that does not work very well. Squeezing somebody from the outside is not nearly as effective as internal pressure cause by muscle contraction. Women CAN DO IT, but they would have to be willing to spend a lot more time int he gym than the men have to in order to get the same result. We HAVE women fighter pilots in reserve unsits (where the requirements are not quit as stringent as active duyty units) but they are mostly intercept pilots (where high G's are not an issue) and there are not many of them, because very few women are willing to do what it takes to maintain the physical conditioning required to meet even the fairly lax requirements of the reserve.",

   "Possibly some psotions, but not most. A large part of Naval combat is firefighting. Everybody on a ship is a firefighter, regardless of other duties. Everybody should check out to the minimum firefighting qualification, and most women simply can't amke the cut. .\n\n What are the physical requirements of firefighting? \n \n Other primary combat operation shipboard include loading the \"big guns\", transporting missiles to launchers, loading torpedos. All of these are incredibly physically sdemanding and while I think that most women could do it once, maybe twice, there is no way women in general can keep up witht he men who do it all day long at a dead run. Women simply do not have the natural upper body strenght.\n\n That makes sense, but are these tasks really still done mainly manually? Aren't there automatic cranes, lifts, and the like on a navy ship which aid in such tasks? Also, possible positions that come to mind include those who fire the big guns and anti-aircraft weapons as well as positions such as navigation or engineering (fixing broken equipment) - though that brings into question whether all positions on a combat ship are by definition involved in combat. I wouldn't think that those would require a lot of upper body strength.\n \n \nAs far as AF, the only combat units the AF has are fighter squadrons, SF units, and bomber squadrons. I think women would make fine bomber pilots/navigators, etc... Unfortunatly, to play on the really cool toys requires that you be a fighter pilot first. \n\n It's actually surprising to hear that it isn't the fighter jets and pilots that are the most highly prized. Given all the Hollywood flicks, such as \"Top Gun\", I always thought that was considered the \"coolest\" type of role in the Air Force. I can imagine that flying a stealth craft of any sort could be exciting, just for the beauty and technology of the aircraft, but I didn't think that they were as maneuverable as some of the top fighter jets. Also, why would bomber pilots or navigators need to be fighter pilots first?\n \n Coming back to Army positions, apart from the infantry, there are tank battalions, as well as other motorized battalions. Offhand, I would think that roles such as tank driver, anti-aircraft gunman, etc., may not need too much upper body strength.\n \n By the way, I have to say that I am quite impressed with your wealth of knowledge of various military roles. :) Not being involved in the military myself, it helps clarify a lot of the physical difficulty of the combat roles which women are trying to fit into.",

   "What are the physical requirements of firefighting? \n\n \n generally, run 100 yards with a 100 lb roll of hose on your back, up a 35 ft ladder, over the top, then back down and back to the start line. Additionally, most instructers will require a times run and climb with a dummy (civilian fire service uses the same specs mostly). You can get a pamphlet from the IAFC (international association of fire fighters) with recommended trainign requirements.\n \n \nThat makes sense, but are these tasks really still done mainly manually? Aren't there automatic cranes, lifts, and the like on a navy ship which aid in such tasks? Also, possible positions that come to mind include those who fire the big guns and anti-aircraft weapons as well as positions such as navigation or engineering (fixing broken equipment) - though that brings into question whether all positions on a combat ship are by definition involved in combat. I wouldn't think that those would require a lot of upper body strength.\n\n \n The problem with putting a woman on the big guns is the way they are loaded and the space confines. A crane comes across the top and lays the round on the loading chute. Then, a crane comes across with the powder charge, 1 bundle at a time (each bundle weighs between 200 and 300 lbs). Once the proper number of bundles are loaded, a ram pushed them into the chute. In theory, you never have to touch anything or carry anything. In reality, about 1 on 10 charge loads rolls off the conveyer and onto the floor. The entire gun battery is silenced until the bundle is picked up and put back on the conveyer and the loading operation is complete. \n \n Navigation and engineering on a ship are, I think, a fine job for a woman. I have a good friend who is curently serving on board an aircraft carrier as an engineer. You just have to make sure that you do not assing your women to first response firefighter duties (keep them on the operational roster). I beleive this is how the navy handles women on ships currently (at least it was the last time I read the manual)\n \n \nIt's actually surprising to hear that it isn't the fighter jets and pilots that are the most highly prized. Given all the Hollywood flicks, such as \"Top Gun\", I always thought that was considered the \"coolest\" type of role in the Air Force. I can imagine that flying a stealth craft of any sort could be exciting, just for the beauty and technology of the aircraft, but I didn't think that they were as maneuverable as some of the top fighter jets. Also, why would bomber pilots or navigators need to be fighter pilots first?\n\n \n There is a pretty serious rivalry between fighter jocks and ground pounders (bombers). The rivalry is largely for show. At one time, the best of the best were in fighters. Now, with our bombers being so expensive, the best of the best are absolutly reserved for bomber duty. If you loose a fighter is is no big deal. If you loose a B-2, you have just flushed billions in aircraft and training down the drain. Also, since a bomber generally lacks the maneuverability of a fighter and has a larger cross section, you need a superior pilot to get it on target without getting blown out of the sky. \n \n \nComing back to Army positions, apart from the infantry, there are tank battalions, as well as other motorized battalions. Offhand, I would think that roles such as tank driver, anti-aircraft gunman, etc., may not need too much upper body strength.\n\n \n Some positions, like drivig a bradley, you are probably correct. The problem is that in theory, every soldier, regardless of theri role, is expected to be able to pick up a rifle and play infantryman. If you have ever really looked at how a bradly takes a shell, you will realise this is nonsense, since the odds of anybopdy surviving a hit in a bradley are incredibly thin. They made a movie abotu what a piece of junk the bradley is, and they were spot on.\n \n A tank is no place for a woman period. The majority of recruits who wash out of tank school do so because they cannot pass the evac drill. In an evac drill, you smoke the tank (fill it full of smoke from a smoke generator) and one guy has to evac 2 other \"unconscious\" subjects. Onlyt abot half of all men can do it. 2 people will not fit through any hatch in an abrams tank at the same time. In order to evac a \"limp\", you have to either climb out the hatch yourself and then reach back in adn drag the limp through, or you have to lift them overhead and toss them out. It is incredibly difficult to do. Imagine lifting a 200 man 3 ft over your head, then literally tossing him out of the way of the hatch.\n \n Most tankmen cannot do it at all, but by god they could when they passed training.\n \n \nBy the way, I have to say that I am quite impressed with your wealth of knowledge of various military roles. :) Not being involved in the military myself, it helps clarify a lot of the physical difficulty of the combat roles which women are trying to fit into.\n\n \n That comes with being a former training officer. I was army, but you study every branchs manuals to see how they are doing it (you don't want the other services calling your guys wimps). \n \n As a training officer, I interacted with over 100,000 US soldiers, some men, some women. After my stint as a training officer, I went SF, saw combat several times, and then went private sector with a well respected private military company, where I saw nothing BUT combat. In the private sector, I served with a couple of women who were up to the task and excelent in combat roles. Overall, though, I can certainly understand why the military is reluctant to put women in combat. I would not want to go into combat with an unknown woman at my side, and I CERTAINLY would not wnat to go with one that I know they cushioned the physical requirements for.\n \n If women want to play with the boys, I think they should be given every opportunity. It needs to be made very clear that no special allowances will be made for them, and we need rules in place that make special treatment of women, or of units with women in them, by commanders a court martialable offense. If women want to be in combat (though I cannot imagine why. The only people who ever want to be in combat are those who never have been), we need everything to be even.",

   "I've often wondered, what exactly is a \"private\" military company? I thought that all military were officially run by the US government?\n\n \n Most OMCs are british or russian based. I think the best known one in recent times was Executive outcomes or Sandline international (both now closed). Now it is illegal for Americans to go to work at a PMC as a professional combat soldier (thanks to the patriot act). It used to be that we were the #2 exporter of private soldiers on the planet (UK was, and still is, #1).\n \n \n \n \nOverall, from your descriptions, it seems that, though there are a minority of combat rolls that a fair number of women would be able to do, most roles are too physically challenging for the great majority of women. I agree that the physical requirements should not be reduced in these roles simply to artificially increase the number of women, but I do continue to expect that those women who are able to meet those tough physical and mental expectations should have the right to participate in those roles.\n\n \n I agree, and not. In combat units, you form a bond with your fellow soldiers. You get to know them and learn to function with them. Pulling a soldier and replacing them at short notice lowers the combat effectiveness of that unit and gets people killed. I think if women are going to serve in combat roles, where their absence at a critical time lowers the effectiveness of their unit and puts lives at risk, they should be required to be on birth control and becoming pregnant should be a court martialable offense. We saw during desert storm a HUGE increase in pregnancy as units were activated. Many women admitted that they tried to become preganant after their unit was activated in order to avoid service. This is not right. Even without considerignt hte fact that they ducked duty, they put the lives of the others in their unit in danger by forcing them to take replacements who are not fully integrated intot the unit for some time. \n \n \nIt seems that the military has come a long way in trying to incorporate women and that some women are making it into combat roles. One question I would have is, how well are these women (the truly qualified ones) accepted by the general group of soldiers when they do enter these roles?\n\n \n Now well, since currently there is no such thing as a \"fully qualified\" woman in combat. Qualifications for women are lower in all services. All you know about the woman in your unit is that she did not pass the same physical tests that you did. Again, they need to make the requirements the same so that when a new recruit is assinged to your unit, you know they passed the same tests as you, regardless of sex.\n \n In addition, women are given preferential treatment by command officers. Units with women in them are held back from dangerous areas. Officers are afraid of the bad press that is almost certain to come with the death or injury of a woman. Look at how the whole Jessica Lynch affair was handlesd in Iraq. Woman was taken as a pow and we devoted significant resources soley to tracking her down and recovering her. Sure, we always try to get POWs back, but in that case tehy devoted an entire platoon of rangers to searching her out. That platoon of rangers came from a combat area, which was left shorthanded, becuase a command decision was made that the life of a single woman soldier was more valuable than safeguarding the lives of soldier in combat. this kind of thing should not occur, and as long as it does, your average grunt on the ground is going to object to the idea of women in combat,\n \n \nOne last issue I would bring up, and this is somewhat unrelated to the topic at hand, is the question of the future automation of various armed forces. Specifically, I've heard that predator drones can already launch missiles and that technology is being explored for un-manned tanks, etc. Do you yourself see this as the future of military combat, or do you see human interaction as irreplaceable?\n\n \n remote control tanks are already a reality and have been for years. Missile equipped predators can already outfly human pilots, mostly due to the fact that they can take substantial G forces, since you only have to worry about the airfram flying apart, not the pilot passing out.\n \n We will absolutly see more remote controlled vehicles, cruise missiles, etc.... in the filed, though I wish to god that we didn't. By changing war from something up close and personal to somethign done by remote control, you dehumanise the enemy and detach your soldeirs form the war alltogether. I have been in control rooms when a predator took out a target. The guys flying it see it as the worlds coolest video game. I have talked to fighter/bomber pilots and folks who man cruise missile batteries. They ahev no consept of the fact that after they release their ordanace, people die. They understand it on an intellectual level, but until you actulla have to wash blood off your hands, the true impact does not hit home.\n \n You can see in the number of civilain casualties of our latest war the effect that this has. Over 95% of the civilain casualties in the Iraqi war have been the result of bombing, \"precision ordinance\", and air strikes. It is easy to sit at HQ and make the decision to launch a cruise missile at an enemy stronghold, even knowing that there are going to be civilian casualties. 50 civilain casualties may seem like an acceptable loss to take out 75 or 100 enemies. It is a lot different when you are on the ground and you know that those 50 civilian casualties are going to die from bullets from your gun, or grenades that you throw. It is different when you actually have to wade through the blood and the bodies of dead women and children after you have taken the objective. \n \n Sitting in an airplane 10,000 ft in the air, or on a missile cruiser launching tomahawks, or at a remote control unit in nevada flying a predator over the ME, you never have to smell the blood. you never have to really take responsibility for your actions becuase you never have to take responsibility for your actions first hand, you never have to see the aftermath. \n \n I know one guy who was a bomber pilot who ended up re-upping and in the infantry (as an officer, of course). He went completely crazy the first time he saw the aftermath of a \"precision bombing run\" that involved dead civilains, in that particular case a woman and 4 children. He ast down on the ground and started crying and had to be carried back to an LZ to be medivaced out (which was a mess and blew the entire mission). Ended up in some mental hospital stateside for a long time, crazier than a shithouse rat. \n \n Until that momnet he never really made the connection between all the hundreds, or even thousands of bombs he had dropped and dead people on the ground. While at an intellectual level he understood that people were dying, it was not personal until he actually saw it and smelled the blood and the stench of decaying meat.\n \n As we depersonalize war, the consequences of that war become depersonalized as well. Deaths, even civilian deaths, become nothing but numbers on a casualty report. They mean nothing. \n \n This is why I think we need a return to vietnam era photojournalism in war zones, not this controlled \"imbedded reporters\" garbage. The photojournalists in Vietnam brought the consequences of war home. We hear today \"100,000 dead civialins in Iraq\", but most people have absolutly no concept of the enormity of 100,000 dead civilians. I have loaded dump trucks with th ebodies of dead civialins, I know exactly what \"100,000 dead civialins\" means. If you stack them like cordwood, and there are plenty of children, you can fit between 75 and 100 dead bodies in a dump truck. 100,000 dead civilians is one hell of a lot of dump trucks full of bodies.\n \n The government and the military claims that they are controlling reporters in Iraq to keep from demoralising the troops. I'm sorry, but this is a load of BS. When you are in a combat zone, what Joe Sixpack bvack home thinks of what you are doing is the last thing on your mind. You enter into an entirely different world in your mind, where all that really matters is staying alive. The problems that guys have with their experincaes later on are almost never the result of bad press at home, they are generally the result fo teh fact that open combat is one of the nastiest things you can possibly imagine, and it is hard to get over that.",

This is why I think regulations need to be changed to make it an offense to favor women or units with women members in combat. In most of the world, there are social predjudices which state that men protect women, they are seen as the weaker sex. Regardless of the physical tests required, male officers will likely continue to take steps to \"protect\" women in combat roles. As long as that is the case, they will not be accepted by their fellow soldiers.\n \n Once the adjustment period is over, and women in combat is not a novelty, and it is expected that they will be treated exactly as the men at all levels, I think they would be accepted right along with everybody else. \n \n \n \nI would agree.

Killing somebody from a distance is akin to watching a TV show about war. \n \n With the whitewashing of the war by the whitehouse, Americans have absolutly no sense of the scale of the thing. This lack of comprehension leads to other problems in regards to understanding the effects of war. Imagine 1000 dump trucks, ever one of them overflowing with civilian bodies stacked like cordwood.

   "As an old-fashioned Republican who has opposed current administration foreign policy from the Iraq invasion/occupation on and their continued blatant fiscal irresponsibility, I've also taken note of the seemingly complete absence of public personal responsibility. It seems whatever is wrapped in the flag is now acceptable and those who disagree are being labeled as unpatriotic. Few Americans understand the underlying causes of terrorism and view it as unprovoked attacks, not retaliation. We're on a bad road and it'll become far worse going in our present direction.\n\n I generally consider myself politically a left-of-center moderate and I never thought I would find myself thinking this, but I actually miss having traditional conservatives as the opponents. I may disagree with traditional conservatives on various social issues and on the role that government could play in helping the underpriviledged, but at least conservatives are generally more responsible fiscally and do not rush head-long into war. These Radical NeoConservatives really scary me. I simply do not see the objective reasoning behind many of their decisions. So many of the decisions seem impulsive, irresponsible and not well thought out. Others quite openly pander to the wealthy - such as the various tax cuts and the excessively lucrative contracts to industries that contribute to Bush's campaign - at a time when we have record budget deficits and debt. Unfortunately, Americans are letting themselves be misled with the successful propaganda campaign that Bush has launched about the Iraq war and have let their attentions be drawn away from real issues by \"red herrings\" such as the Gay marriage debate.",

This administration has proven the ability to refocus that public at will using fear and very questionable morality is child's play. When a national budget admittedly and openly excludes costs for Afghanistan/Iraq, doesn't allow for revenue lost to tax cuts, uses proposed domestic program reductions to cover military spending increases and still announces a record deficit along with record trade imbalance, it seems obvious that the public is a large group of dum dums. As I've stated before, I hope they've all amassed substantial personal wealth in something other than dollars to tide them over the aftereffects of this administration's policies. They're going to need it.",

   "It scares me that criticism of US policies is starting to be equated in many circles with Anti-Americanism again. It's not quite McCarthyism, but is headed in that awful direction. What ever happenned to thinking for oneself? I can understand how some on the far left can go too far in their attacks but it seems that the right tries to label anyone who presents rational criticisms of US policy as America-hating, and that more and more people are believing them, without looking at the facts. There is a dangerous naive notion of patriotism coming back. I'm not sure if it is the lack of true journalism that is driving that change or the other way around, but something has to change. \n \n Many issues in the Middle East are so oversimplified, it's scary. People see only the horrors of terrorism without looking to see if there are any valid underlying causes. Mind you, I am not justifying terrorism as a tactic, far from it, but if we ignore the underlying causes (be it our seemingly one-sided support of Israel to our tolerance of totalitarian regimes in order to guarantee our oil supply), we will continue to generate more terrorists. Our attack on Iraq based on the faulty premise of WMDs has certainly not helped in our war on terror.\n\n \n It seems that the secret to keeping the Americn public perpetually in the dark is the ability to immediatly refocus public attention, and the fact that the Americna public is gullible enough to fall for this. It also seems that the American public has an awesome ability to hold two conflicting ideas in their mind at the same time and accept them both as absolute truth. Most Americans seem to recognise the fact that Bin Laden has several hundred million dollars, yet I cannot count the number of folks who have claimed that he hates Americans for our wealth. Also, according to many americans, AQ simultaneously envies our freedom, and wishes to destroy every man woman and child because they hate freedom (the envy part comes from bush, who following the 9/11 attacks said \"they envy our wealth and our freedom\").\n \n Most Americans seem to recognise the fact that our foreign policy has included things like using foreign aid to secure markets for US corporations and securing exeption for those same corporations from labor laws (child labor, minimum wage, workplace safety, etc...) and that we fairly routinely use our military as a diplomatic tool. They (the American public) do not seem able to connect these things, which they generally recognise as evil, sometimes going so far as to actually use the word \"evil\", with global anti american sentiment.\n \n We accept and acknowledge that we have killed a LOT of civilains in Iraq, but accept withotu question that the insurgents there have no legitimate complaint with the US, they simply ahte our form of government. \n \n We are intent on installing a free governement there, and will kill anybody who stands in our way (which would certainly seem to me to be the opposite of \"freedom\").\n \n Personally, I find the shiftin rational in recent wars to be horrifying. We started at war with terrorists, namely AQ. We attacked Afghanistan because that is where AQ was. Then we attacked Iraq because they were a bunch of terrorists, too, and they had WMDs. Once the terrorist rational dried up (and if you will remewmber, that was the first rational), it was soley about WMDs, though nobody apparently thought to ask how saddam, even with WMD's, in the Middle East, was a threat to the US when his longest range weapons were incapable of hitting anything outside the ME. Once the WMD theory dried up, we just made it a humanitarian war (though killing 100,000 civilains is not a really humanitarin kind of thing). Now even that has shifted a bit, and we are spreading democracy which means that we don't have to be quite so \"humanitarian\", since it is not so much abotu helping the people right now as some vaugly defined idealogical goal for the future.\n \n The American public made each of these leaps without question. The whoel thing has been an exercise in willful misdirection.\n \n We do tis domestically, too. There are some pretty important issues facing this nation. We never hear anything from our politicians regarding correcting these or even admission that there is a problem. Instead of discussing the fat that our quality of life is falling off a cliff and is being artificaially sustained almost entirely by debt, or the fact that the dollar has fallen in the toilet and we are all making the same money, but it is coming closer and closer to being valued 1:1 with the peso, we argu about idiotic things like gun control, when the percentage of people killed by guns in this country is so pitifully small that it si entirely inconsequential, and seat belt laws (same thing as gun control....percentage is so low you could safely write it off).\n \n We aregue abotu insurace reform, and tort reform, but do not mention the fact that our criminal justice system is broken and we have one of the highest rate of incarceration on the planet. \n \n It is rediculous.\n \n \n \nAs to the original topic of women in combat, I think that we pretty much agree that women should be allowed in combat, as long as they meet equal standards. I've pretty much run out of issues to bring up on that subject and have learned a lot from our discussion.\n\n \n I am glad we can agree. I think my attitude is pretty standard for military personel. I know that a lot of civilians consider things like the possibility of females being raped if captured and such, but that does not seem to enter into the thinking of most military men I have discussed the issue with. Being tortured if captured is and accepted risk. As horrible as being raped may be, there are certainly worse things that can happen in a torture situation. \n \n If you think of any more questions, feel free to ask, and I will answer to the best of my ability. The women in combat question has kind of lost momentum in recent years. Iw as unfortunate enough to be serving as a training officer when it was gathering momentum, and as a training officer at one of the bases that had facilites for women recruits, we were kind of right in the middle of that particular storm. It kind of ticked me off at the time, because I farnkly saw it as a non issue. Very seldom did you see a woman who actually wanted to be in a combat unit, and those who did usually backed off after learning what was required for combat training. We did have one woman who wanted to go SF, and was going to sue for the chance. We took her back and put her through 1 day of SF training. She lasted less than 2 hours and returned to her unit with a whole new outlook on the subject.",

It is clear that the administration seems to be in some sort of closed-box mentality that even does not allow wiser voices from the Republican side, such as that of Collin Powell, to be heard. \n\n \n The problems we are currently having in Iraq were the very reason that Bush senior cited for not completely overrunning the country and overhtrowing the government over a decade ago.\n \n I think that, in part, the current administrations views on American capability are so far out of bounds of reality that they are incapable of accepting our limitations. \n \n Second, it seems fairly obvious to me that the whole Iraqi war, as well as the phantom war on terrorism, is largely a ploy to unite the people of the United States against a common enemy and focus our attention outward, as well as being a pretty good chance to strip some undesirable rights away from the American people, which will certinaly make us easier to deal with in our upcoming economically troubled period. I posted this quote in another thread to day, but frankly I think it bears repeating. It is by Julius Caesar:\n \n \n\"Beware of the leader who bangs of war in order to whip the citizenry into a patriotic fervor, for patriotism is indeed a double edged sword. It both emboldens the blood, just as it narrows the mind.\n \n \"And when the drums of war have reached a fevor pitch and the blood boils with hate and the mind is closed, the leader will have no need in seizing the rights of the citizenry. Rather, the citizenry infused with fear and blinded by patriotism, will offer up all of their rights unto the leader and do it gladly so. \"How do I know? I know for this is what I have done. And I am Caesar.\" \n \n \n \n \nIt is a rather alarming state and the only thing that can keep the government in control is the will of the people, naive as that may sound.

I would have to disagree about the media to some degree, though. The American public wants to be entertained. They want to turn on the news and watch their program, and then feel good about themselves and their country, and the media is driven by ratings, so they give the American people what they want. \n \n I have posted before regarding the mentality of soldiers in combat zones, specifically that no matter what the circumstances or particulars of the engagement, combat soldiers MUST believe that they are fighting on the side of ultimate right, and that the people they are fighting for are going to be genuinly appreciative of their efforts once they realise the good that the soldier have done. If you can not make yourself believe this, regardless of circumstance, especially in an engagement like Iraq where there are astronomically high levels of civilian casualties, you are doomed. Because if you are NOT fighting on the side of right, then you are just a civilian killing scumbag.\n \n I think to some extent, the American public has adopted this same mentality, which is why we see the incessant need to frankly blow the pre war conditions in Iraq out of proportion as far as the cruelty factor goes. Either our nation and our governemtn is fighting on the side of absolute right, or they are jst civilain murdering scumbags, and by proxy, that makes US civilian murdering scumbags, since we elected these jokers.\n \n \nI find it so frustrating to watch happen and feel that those of us who do feel this way (which is certainly not a small percentage) should do whatever we can to help change the state of affairs - through voting, writing letters to congress, letters to the editor of publications, and even through participating in discussion forums such as this.

It is too late to wrk within the system, but too soon to start shooting the bastards.\n \n Though I reserve my right to change my opinion regarding the second half of that until I see the finished budget, as well as how my state (which has issued a ton of bonds in the last several years with no concrete plan or fixed revenue stream for repayment), deals with the reduction in trickle down federal funds. \n \n \n I believe I have told this story here before, but maybe not. I was at a meeting of local businessmen and as the meeting broke up, several of us (maybe 20) were standing around talking about some of the rediculous proposals that have been advanced by members of our state legislature to meet the upcoming financial crunch. On guy said \"If they actually do that, I am going to start hiring hit men and point them towards topeka (capitol of KS)\".\n \n We all knew he was kidding, but nobody laughed, and it led to a rather long discussion about where you might find such people and the costs assocaited with such a project. I think some of those folks may have been pretty serious about the idea. We are tired of constantly getting raped by the fiscal irresponsibility of our elected officials.",

However, I do acknowedge that there is a balance to be made between freedom and effective security. I do not trust this administration to set that balance wisely but I believe that it is something that should be brought up for public debate. Namely, terrorists can cause tremendous harm compared to your typical criminal. If we continue with the full spectrum of rights accorded in your average crime, then we may well be ineffective in stopping another terrorist attack. However, if we circumvent rights in order to ensure security, then we are certainly risking causing injustice against the innocent and risking introducing a climate of fear of the establishment which is counter to everything we believe as Americans about freedom. As a Caucasion first generation American, any such restrictions would probably not effect me too much. However, principals are very important and I would not deny someone of Middle-Eastern descent the same rights that I expect.\n \n I'm not sure what you mean by \"phantom\" war on terrorism. I would say that the president is exploiting and mis-using that term - as in invading Iraq by claiming falsely that it was a terrorist threat, or by letting Israel and Russia feel free to deal with their terrorist threats (Palestinians and Chechnians, respectively) independent of any issue of injustice on their part. However, there are terrorist groups out there and September 11 has shown that they are more than willing and able to cause great harm to the US. That threat cannot be ignored, but it must be approached wisely and I would agree that Bush lacks that wisdom.\n \nI would certainly agree that apathy is a major porblem. I would have to disagree about the media to some degree, though. The American public wants to be entertained. They want to turn on the news and watch their program, and then feel good about themselves and their country, and the media is driven by ratings, so they give the American people what they want. \n\n I certainly can see that, from the point of view of profits alone, media turn to what entertains people and gets the best ratings. However, in the past, the media seemed to have had more of a sense of responsibility to educate the public as well. I've heard that the news programs of the main TV networks mainly lost money in the past, but the networks kept them on out of a sense of responsiblity to the public. Where is that responsibility now? One could argue that the TV networks now have much more competition from cable, etc. However, would it really cost them so much in profit to be more honest and have true investigative journalism in their news? Do they really think that people would flock away from such shows? Investigative news shows like Frontline seem to still be popular enough.\n \n\n I have posted before regarding the mentality of soldiers in combat zones, specifically that no matter what the circumstances or particulars of the engagement, combat soldiers MUST believe that they are fighting on the side of ultimate right, and that the people they are fighting for are going to be genuinly appreciative of their efforts once they realise the good that the soldier have done. If you can not make yourself believe this, regardless of circumstance, especially in an engagement like Iraq where there are astronomically high levels of civilian casualties, you are doomed. Because if you are NOT fighting on the side of right, then you are just a civilian killing scumbag.\n\n From your experience with the military, what are typical soldier's views of the morality and justice of the war in Iraq? My own view is that we never had the justification of attacking Iraq but, now that we have, we have the responsibility both to that nation and to ourselves to make sure that we leave it a stable, non-despotic, country. If we don't, then not only will the Iraqi people suffer, but we may well be creating a terrorist supporting country where there previously wasn't one.\n \nFrankly, I think we are at a delciate crossroads in Americna history. It is too late to wrk within the system, but too soon to start shooting the bastards.\n\n I guess I would disagree with you that it is too late to work within the system. Just several months ago, spurred on by a call to arms by MoveOn.org, I sent one of ten thousand e-mail messages to the Federal Election Commision to stop the efforts of the Republican National Committee to force their commision to shut down non-profit groups that criticize the administration - and these e-mails worked. There are many such examples of people successfully taking action to change the government. All it takes is a critical mass of people to discard their pessimism and take action. Believe me, I know how easy it is to become apathetic due to pessimism, but, if too many of us believe that we have no power to change things then we WON'T have any power to change things. It does not take a majority of people to take action, just a critical mass. When the only voices of dissent that are heard are those of the far-left, whose arguements are not always rational, then no wonder that your average American cannot relate. However, the more Americans hear from rational, non-beligerent, non-fringe Americans about the problems with the government, the more people will be convinced. My optimism is cautious, but I believe that each person who gives up on working within the system decreases the change of success.",

As a Caucasion first generation American, any such restrictions would probably not effect me too much. However, principals are very important and I would not deny someone of Middle-Eastern descent the same rights that I expect.\n\n \n The problem is that as you harden certain targets, terrorists simply shift focus to softer targets. You cannot protect the whole country all the time. If we give up some rights in regards to air travel becuase of terrorist attacks, it stands to reason that should they attack a train, we can expect to give up a few more civil liberties to portect trains. When they shift to office buildings, we give up a little more to protect office buildings. Then they start attacking shopping malls. If we get intot his pattern of giving up some rights in order to protect ourselves, we will in short order have no rights and no protection. \n \n People I know in federal law enforcement claim the nightmare scenario, outside of a mushroom cloud over a major US city (which is by no means considered outside the realm of possiblity) is that the terrorist swith to entirley soft targets. Instead of elaborate plots to take out high profile targets, they send over 100 guys, brek them into 2 man teams, and have each team fire bomb one commercial building each week. In reality, the odds of catching somebody who pulls up to a random factory, office building, major store, etc.. throws a half dozen moltov cocktails, then gets back in their vehicle and drives away, are abysmal. At the same time, 50 such attacks per week have the potential of costing America billions of dollars on a weekly basis. Femas proposed solution to such a turn of events includes martial law, curfews, and suspension of constitutional government. \n \n I have no doubt in my mind that the Bush administration would jump at this \"solution\" should the occasion ever present itself.\n \n \nI'm not sure what you mean by \"phantom\" war on terrorism. I would say that the president is exploiting and mis-using that term - as in invading Iraq by claiming falsely that it was a terrorist threat, or by letting Israel and Russia feel free to deal with their terrorist threats (Palestinians and Chechnians, respectively) independent of any issue of injustice on their part. However, there are terrorist groups out there and September 11 has shown that they are more than willing and able to cause great harm to the US. That threat cannot be ignored, but it must be approached wisely and I would agree that Bush lacks that wisdom.\n\n \n I refer to the war on terrorisnm as a phantom war because it really does not exist. We are certainly fighitn a war in Iraq, and afghanistan, but our search for terrorists has essentially ended. There is not a single US soldier today primarily tasked with finding Bin Laden or Al Queda members. The powers that be continue to call it a war because it gets the publics attention and allows them to justify some things that otherwise simply would not fly.\n \n \n \nFrom your experience with the military, what are typical soldier's views of the morality and justice of the war in Iraq? My own view is that we never had the justification of attacking Iraq but, now that we have, we have the responsibility both to that nation and to ourselves to make sure that we leave it a stable, non-despotic, country. If we don't, then not only will the Iraqi people suffer, but we may well be creating a terrorist supporting country where there previously wasn't one.\n\n \n I would say first of all that we are almost certainly creating a terrorist haven where one did not previoulsy exist. With the makeup of the new elected body in Iraq, there is really no question that the new nation will be closely tied to Iran. \"Our guys\" (allawis list) took less than 15% of the vote. Deals are already in play between sistanis list (hardline shiites) and the kurds to install a Shiite prime minister, and at this point Chalibi, our enemy who was spying for Iran, seems to be the frint runner. In exchange for allowing the shiites the post of prime minister, the president will be kurdish (at leas tthta is how the deal seems to be progressing). All the kurds seem to want is autonomy, and the shiites are more than happy to give it to them so long as they leave the rest of the country to the shiites. The guys on allawis list are pretty much inconsequential, since only 2/3 is required for the group to do just about anything, and between the hard line shiites and the kurds, they haev far more than 2/3 of the vote.\n \n As far as what your average soldier thinks about the morality of the Iraqi situation, most of those who are there do not give a rats behind. Most of our soldiers on the ground in Iraq are young and fresh. They have not spent a significant amount of time under fire. About the second time people shoot at them, the morality of the situation goes out the window and they don't care about anything but survival. This is why, regardless of the war, atrocities are nearly always committed by young guys with little combat experience. When you are being shot at, everybody starts to look like the enemy, and it does not take long before you have no problem justifying just about anything from executing prisoners to blowing up schoolchildren. It simply does not matter at that point. The survival instinct in human beings is just as strong as it is in other animals.\n \n since we have started rotating troops out, and new troops in, we are starting to get some older guys in there like my wifes uncle. He has been in every war, police action, and peacekeeping mission that the Us has been involved in for the last 30 years. He has seen a LOT of combat. guys who see a lot fo combat are not so terrified by it (and that is the real issue, young guys get terrified and behave poorly and their thought process is driven by fear). After you have seen enough combat, you become somewhat numb to its effects. It ceases to be terrifying and is simply horrible. Horrible you can deal with rationally, terrified you cannot. \n \n I have spoken to a lot ofolder guys who have been to Iraq and are back. most of them say that as far as civilain deaths and brutality by American troops, raq is worse than vietnam was. I think that a lot of these older guys, the ones who have been around enough to be able to remain at least somewhat objective in the face of war, are having a tough time coping. After you have been playing the game for enough years, self deception becomes more difficult.\n \n This brings me to maybe the most dangerous propoganda tool that our government can bring to bear against their opposition. Thet is the \"support our troops\" card, oncluding the implication that by disagreeing with the war, you are demoralising our troops. I will tell you a little secret, this comes not only from me, but from dozens, if not hundreds, of other soldiers I have known who have seen a lot of combat and spent more than their share of time in the mud and the blood. The troops don't give a rats XXX if you support them or not. They are following orders and staying alive, whether the folks back home sitting in front of the ir tV's and PC's think the cause is just or not makes absolutly no difference to them. \n \n During vietnam, when people were lining up at the airport to spit on returning soldiers, that was demoralizing. Seeing John Kerry, one of their own, get up and claim that every American soldier in vietnam has committed war crimes was demoralizing. Having people say \"I don't think this war is right and here are the reasons....\" is not demoralizing. As I said before, soldiers have an excellent capability for self deception. It does not matter whether the cause is just or not, in their mind it is. Evn soldiers that participate in wholesale slaughters of civilains generally will argue that their cause was just.\n \n \n \nI guess I would disagree with you that it is too late to work within the system. Just several months ago, spurred on by a call to arms by MoveOn.org, I sent one of ten thousand e-mail messages to the Federal Election Commision to stop the efforts of the Republican National Committee to force their commision to shut down non-profit groups that criticize the administration - and these e-mails worked. There are many such examples of people successfully taking action to change the government. All it takes is a critical mass of people to discard their pessimism and take action. Believe me, I know how easy it is to become apathetic due to pessimism, but, if too many of us believe that we have no power to change things then we WON'T have any power to change things. It does not take a majority of people to take action, just a critical mass. When the only voices of dissent that are heard are those of the far-left, whose arguements are not always rational, then no wonder that your average American cannot relate. However, the more Americans hear from rational, non-beligerent, non-fringe Americans about the problems with the government, the more people will be convinced. My optimism is cautious, but I believe that each person who gives up on working within the system decreases the change of success.\n\n \n The only thing that politicians fear anymore is bad press, and they weigh the bad press they are likely to recieve for any given action against the election dollars they can expect it to gain them (generalyl from corporate contributors or special interest groups) and decide whether they can buy enough advertising to offset the bad press.\n \n In my business, my primary customer is the US government, either directly or via either boeing or lockheed martin. I know how much it costs to buy a senator, and depending on how big a favor you need, it is pretty affordable. Large corporations start supprting promising canidates at the local level, sometimes even with particularly promising county comissioners or mayors, and certainly at the state legislature level. They pick out promising guys, guys they feel they can advance, and they fund them from the getgo. That way, all they have to do is bang the party drum and they end up in the US senate. The upside to the corporation is that they have already bought that guy. At that point, it is not merely a question of making election donations, or tossing some side business towards a favored son, or nephew in order to catch the ear of a congressman. If you have funded them from the getgo, you OWN them, and they know it. \n \n At one time, I was cautiously optomistic. Now, I honestly believe that the American people are too dumb and too apathetic to be able to fix anything at all. Our polticians are a bunch of special interest whores, and we know it. they lie routinely to the Aemrican people, so often it is a cliche, and we just accept this.

   "\n I certainly can see that, from the point of view of profits alone, media turn to what entertains people and gets the best ratings. However, in the past, the media seemed to have had more of a sense of responsibility to educate the public as well. I've heard that the news programs of the main TV networks mainly lost money in the past, but the networks kept them on out of a sense of responsiblity to the public. Where is that responsibility now? One could argue that the TV networks now have much more competition from cable, etc. However, would it really cost them so much in profit to be more honest and have true investigative journalism in their news? Do they really think that people would flock away from such shows? Investigative news shows like Frontline seem to still be popular enough.\n\n \n I've posted on this before.

   "The problem is that as you harden certain targets, terrorists simply shift focus to softer targets. You cannot protect the whole country all the time. If we give up some rights in regards to air travel becuase of terrorist attacks, it stands to reason that should they attack a train, we can expect to give up a few more civil liberties to portect trains. When they shift to office buildings, we give up a little more to protect office buildings. Then they start attacking shopping malls. If we get intot his pattern of giving up some rights in order to protect ourselves, we will in short order have no rights and no protection. \n\n It seems to me that your arguments here assume that the main way to avoid terrorist attacks is by protecting the possible targets. Yes, that is one way and I agree with you that this method could eventually lead to a gradual decrease in our rights. I was annoyed enough already at having had my 1 1/2 inch blade pocket Swiss Army Knife and 1 inch bladed scissors taken away from me at the airport. I can imagine how annoying much harsher restrictions in many other areas of life would be.\n \n However, there is another set of approaches to stopping terrorist attacks which you do not address and that is to stop them at their source by finding the terrorist leaders and cells themselves, through a combination of spying, wire-tapping, etc., and preventing them from taking action through either arrest, death, or cutting off their financial sources or communication links. These methods would be much less invasive to the public in general, but could potentially harm innocents that may simply seem suspicious. \n \nI refer to the war on terrorisnm as a phantom war because it really does not exist. We are certainly fighitn a war in Iraq, and afghanistan, but our search for terrorists has essentially ended. There is not a single US soldier today primarily tasked with finding Bin Laden or Al Queda members. The powers that be continue to call it a war because it gets the publics attention and allows them to justify some things that otherwise simply would not fly.\n\n I agree, but not completely. My understanding is that the administration is continuing to try to cut away the funding of terrorist organizations, is continuing to try to find terrorist cells in this country (not an easy task) and is pushing other countries (including Pakistan, where Bin Ladin most likely is hiding) into finding their terrorist cells. I am sure that the administration could be doing a lot more and was certainly disappointed to see how many resources had been pulled away from the efforts to find Bin Ladin, but the administration does deserve at least a little bit of credit for the efforts that it HAS made. I do agree, however, that Bush is very much misusing the idea of a war on terrorism to push an unrelated agenda.\n \nI would say first of all that we are almost certainly creating a terrorist haven where one did not previoulsy exist. With the makeup of the new elected body in Iraq, there is really no question that the new nation will be closely tied to Iran. \"Our guys\" (allawis list) took less than 15% of the vote. ... \n\n It is scary to think that a stable, democratically elected government in Iraq (which is, after all, what Bush is claiming to support) would end up being a terrorist haven and I acknowledge that that is a possibility. However, do you really think that such a Shiite dominated country would be foolish enough to support anti-American terrorists, given the US ability and obvious willingness to invade them again if that would be the case. I would think that they mostly care about controlling their own lives again, without interference from the US.\n \nAs far as what your average soldier thinks about the morality of the Iraqi situation, most of those who are there do not give a rats behind. Most of our soldiers on the ground in Iraq are young and fresh. They have not spent a significant amount of time under fire. About the second time people shoot at them, the morality of the situation goes out the window and they don't care about anything but survival. ...I have spoken to a lot ofolder guys who have been to Iraq and are back. most of them say that as far as civilain deaths and brutality by American troops, raq is worse than vietnam was. I think that a lot of these older guys, the ones who have been around enough to be able to remain at least somewhat objective in the face of war, are having a tough time coping. After you have been playing the game for enough years, self deception becomes more difficult.\n\n I can understand soldiers not having any compassion for the fighting enemy - after all, it would take a saintly personality to have compassion for someone who is trying to kill you. However, it surprises me that these new soldiers do not have compassion for civilians who are killed. Why do you think that is? Are the Iraqi civilians de-humanized? Are they considered to be supportive of the insurgent fighters and therefore deserve to be killed?\n \nThis brings me to maybe the most dangerous propoganda tool that our government can bring to bear against their opposition. Thet is the \"support our troops\" card, oncluding the implication that by disagreeing with the war, you are demoralising our troops. I will tell you a little secret, this comes not only from me, but from dozens, if not hundreds, of other soldiers I have known who have seen a lot of combat and spent more than their share of time in the mud and the blood. The troops don't give a rats XXX if you support them or not. They are following orders and staying alive, whether the folks back home sitting in front of the ir tV's and PC's think the cause is just or not makes absolutly no difference to them. ... Having people say \"I don't think this war is right and here are the reasons....\" is not demoralizing. As I said before, soldiers have an excellent capability for self deception. It does not matter whether the cause is just or not, in their mind it is. \n\n It was so frustrating, during the run-up to the election, to see Bush claiming that we should not admit that the invasion was a mistake, since that could demoralize the troups. Truth is truth! If, as you say, the troups really don't care whether the invasion was just, then this tactic was not only a political ploy, but was also an all-out lie (not surprising, coming from Bush).\n \nThe only thing that politicians fear anymore is bad press, and they weigh the bad press they are likely to recieve for any given action against the election dollars they can expect it to gain them (generalyl from corporate contributors or special interest groups) and decide whether they can buy enough advertising to offset the bad press.\n\n Well, the balance they are trying to reach is simply a balance that will ensure their re-election. Of course, the more election money they have (from corporate sources, individuals, unions, etc.), the better their chances of re-election due to advertising opportunities that can affect public views. Bad press does have the power to sway public opinion and I can well imagine their fear of such bad press. The public also bases their views on other things than the press or political advertisements - including word of mouth (both personal and through the internet and other similar sources, even through such forums), and on their own personal convictions. I guess I'm simply saying that the election dollar is not almighty and people are not infinitely maleable. Polititians do care about what people think and how strongly they hold their opinions. If people don't care much about a subject, then a politician will have much more leeway to be bought out on that subject. However, if people are empassioned about a subject, then the corporate influence will be much less. I guess I think that it is not an impossible task to get the populace aware and excited about a subject through grass-roots efforts. Also, I've heard that each opinion written in a letter to a congressman is considered as if 100 people hold such an opinion so, for example, 10,000 e-mails can have the weight of 1 million voices.\n \nAt one time, I was cautiously optomistic. Now, I honestly believe that the American people are too dumb and too apathetic to be able to fix anything at all. Our polticians are a bunch of special interest whores, and we know it. they lie routinely to the Aemrican people, so often it is a cliche, and we just accept this. Over the last 50 years, we have allowed our constitutionally protected rights to slip away, alway on the theory that it was for the greater good, or a necessity, and we have done nothing.\nI agree that the apathy of the American people has led to a lot of dangerous changes in the power of our government. However, I have to continue to stand on principle and say that, if we ourselves become apathetic as well, then we have no right to complain about the apathy of others. It is SO easy to lose hope in the \"power of the people\" but I truly believe that, no matter how hopeless it may seem, we have to continue to hold the fort (I'm full of cliches today) and try. I don't believe that the cause is hopeless. There are many examples of grass-roots efforts causing positive changes. Also, I am hearing that more and more people are getting their information from internet blogs, which are not controleable by corporations or the government, as I understand. Lastly, as the cost of the government's failed policies starts affecting peoples lives, people will start paying more attention. After all, you can't live on credit forever and, if you alienate all of your allies, your own interests will also start to be affected as well.",

   "From your descriptions, it sounds like combat in the Navy and Air Force, apart from SF units and combat pilots, has low enough physical requirements that many women might be able to fill those rolls. \n \n As for a combat pilot, how much physical strength is required in that role? I can imagine that they must be able to take a lot of G-forces, in order to make tight turns. I'm not sure how men and women differ in ability to withstand G-forces, but its certainly possible that there is a large difference.

These methods would be much less invasive to the public in general, but could potentially harm innocents that may simply seem suspicious. \n\n \n The proble is that this WILL NOT work. Al Queda, indeed most major terrorist organisations operating today, ae using the cell based structure that the CIA developed in the late 50s and early 60s as an ideal structure for resistance cells against soviet occupation. It is undefeatable.\n \n We taught this at WHINSEC. The way it works ius pretty simple. you break up your entire organization into a series of cells, each containing 3-6 men. Each cell operated independantly, and you can ban 2 or 3 cells together fro major operations. Every cell is autonomous, and the leader of each cell generally has the name of a single contact person in another cell that they can contact in order to collaborate on major operations. \n \n For every 5-10 cells, there iwll be a single paymaster who deals with monetary support. contacting the paymaster is generally done through a blind drop at predetermined locations on a floating schedule. The paymaster will have his own cell which will handle the actual contacts, thus protecting the paymaster. If a member goes out to pik up a drop and does not return at the designated time, the paymaster cuts ties and runs. Any individual paymaster does not have acces to money or account details. Paymasters operate in pairs, and each pair has half of an account number and passcode. The numbers are never consecutive. Generally they are given in alternating sequence (i.e if your number is 1234567, one paymaster would have 1357 and the other would have 246) This ensures that even if one paymaster is captured, his portion of the account number cannot help in tracking down the funds.\n \n Above the paymasters is a level of leadership cells, then layer of advisory cells, then anotehr level of leadersip cells. \n \n The entire system is designed to be nearly impossible to penetrate for intelligence purposes. Cells are not randomly chosen. You KNOW the guys in your cell, and in most cases have known them for years. Somebody you don't know who just shows up and says \" I want to join\" is assumed to be a spy. \n \n even when the soviets had near total control of a country, completelyy disregarded anything resembeling rights or legal process, they could not break the cell based structure. Even if you get lucky and capture a guy who knows a name or two outside his cell, by the time you get it out of him, the names he knew will be worthless, as will the contact information he had. The minute somebody is captured, word goes out and everbody scatters. In order for the cature to do you any good at all, the guy would have to start blabbing the second you catch him.\n \n \nI agree, but not completely. My understanding is that the administration is continuing to try to cut away the funding of terrorist organizations, is continuing to try to find terrorist cells in this country (not an easy task) and is pushing other countries (including Pakistan, where Bin Ladin most likely is hiding) into finding their terrorist cells. I am sure that the administration could be doing a lot more and was certainly disappointed to see how many resources had been pulled away from the efforts to find Bin Ladin, but the administration does deserve at least a little bit of credit for the efforts that it HAS made. I do agree, however, that Bush is very much misusing the idea of a war on terrorism to push an unrelated agenda.\n\n \n Again, though, this will do no good, and they know it. The system these guys are using was developed by US. We know that it is very nearly impossible to beat, especially when you are counting on foreign agents to do it for you. Currently, military estimates of Al Quedas membership tops 15,000. \n \n \nIt is scary to think that a stable, democratically elected government in Iraq (which is, after all, what Bush is claiming to support) would end up being a terrorist haven and I acknowledge that that is a possibility. However, do you really think that such a Shiite dominated country would be foolish enough to support anti-American terrorists, given the US ability and obvious willingness to invade them again if that would be the case. I would think that they mostly care about controlling their own lives again, without interference from the US.\n\n \n I doubt that the Us could get away with it again. first, if the new governemtn of Iraq ends up closely alinged with Iran, it seems reasonable to assume that Iraq would be included in Iran and Syrias new alliance. Second, the Iraqis are already working on rebuilding their military. With the US supposedly backing the new government, we cannot exaclty go out of our way to keep our EU allies and the russians from selling Iraq new weapons. The Iraqis are buying british tanks, french helicopters, EU fighters and russian intercept missile systems. Invading raq again would not be such an easy task. Besides, you really think the international community would stand for us invading the nation that we just liberated in order to depose the governmetn that we just installed? besides it not flying on the international stage, it would be a foreign policy nightmare since it would essentially be a confirmation of what the rest of the wqorld has been claiming all along....that this was one big mistake.\n \n \nI can understand soldiers not having any compassion for the fighting enemy - after all, it would take a saintly personality to have compassion for someone who is trying to kill you. However, it surprises me that these new soldiers do not have compassion for civilians who are killed. Why do you think that is? Are the Iraqi civilians de-humanized? Are they considered to be supportive of the insurgent fighters and therefore deserve to be killed?\n\n \n Because to a green combat soldier, whose though process is dominated by fear, an \"us and them\" mentality develops quickly. American troops do not kill you, Iraqis do. As time passes, you stop viewing any Iraqi as a civilain and see them all as possible insurgents. When misjudging somebodies intentions brings the possibility of death, you shoot first and ask questions later.\n \n It is a seige mentality. Your enemies are iraqis, therefore Iraqis are your enemy. \n \n \nIt was so frustrating, during the run-up to the election, to see Bush claiming that we should not admit that the invasion was a mistake, since that could demoralize the troups. Truth is truth! If, as you say, the troups really don't care whether the invasion was just, then this tactic was not only a political ploy, but was also an all-out lie (not surprising, coming from Bush).\n\n \n \n Of course it was. Troop moral is important, and demoralized troopsa re less effective. People fail to realise that to as slodier in the field, the world becomes a vary small place, and their moral is almost entirely based on their percieved chances of survival. This is why our troops exposure to the media is so carefully controlled, primarily limited to military publications (stars and stripes) and military controlled radio. You don't want your troops being hammered constantly with reports of US casualties and reports of increased insurgent strenght.\n \n Honestly, if you want a fair to decent picture of how that game is played, watch \"good morning vietnam\". What you see there by way of censorship is right out of the book.\n \n \n [/quote]Well, the balance they are trying to reach is simply a balance that will ensure their re-election.

However, if people are empassioned about a subject, then the corporate influence will be much less. I guess I think that it is not an impossible task to get the populace aware and excited about a subject through grass-roots efforts. Also, I've heard that each opinion written in a letter to a congressman is considered as if 100 people hold such an opinion so, for example, 10,000 e-mails can have the weight of 1 million voices.\n I agree that the apathy of the American people has led to a lot of dangerous changes in the power of our government. However, I have to continue to stand on principle and say that, if we ourselves become apathetic as well, then we have no right to complain about the apathy of others. It is SO easy to lose hope in the \"power of the people\" but I truly believe that, no matter how hopeless it may seem, we have to continue to hold the fort (I'm full of cliches today) and try. I don't believe that the cause is hopeless. There are many examples of grass-roots efforts causing positive changes. Also, I am hearing that more and more people are getting their information from internet blogs, which are not controleable by corporations or the government, as I understand. Lastly, as the cost of the government's failed policies starts affecting peoples lives, people will start paying more attention. After all, you can't live on credit forever and, if you alienate all of your allies, your own interests will also start to be affected as well.[/QUOTE]\n \n \n As far as I can tell, the two party system and the failure of people to act on their outrage pretty much kills off any real possibility of grassroots change, especially now that the ideaologies of the two parties have become so close as to be nearly indiscernable.",

   "The proble is that this WILL NOT work. Al Queda, indeed most major terrorist organisations operating today, ae using the cell based structure that the CIA developed in the late 50s and early 60s as an ideal structure for resistance cells against soviet occupation. It is undefeatable.\n\n \n ********. nothing is undefeatable. if somebody made it, somebody else can break it.\n \n \nWe taught this at WHINSEC. The way it works ius pretty simple. you break up your entire organization into a series of cells, each containing 3-6 men. Each cell operated independantly, and you can ban 2 or 3 cells together fro major operations. Every cell is autonomous, and the leader of each cell generally has the name of a single contact person in another cell that they can contact in order to collaborate on major operations. \n\n \n see? progress. the only problem i see is getting the damn aclu to look the other way when the badass boys in black go in to 'obtain information' from the one who knows where the other cells are.\n \n on a side note, this is a more primitive form of the cell structure used by the french resistance during world war 2: each person only knew at most 3 people, and at the very bottom, they only knew one: their superior. every man or woman was, in essence, an independent cell. if you'd like to get introspective, you could say that the CIA didn't teach alqaeda this so that they would be able to break up the cells later if need be.\n \n \neven when the soviets had near total control of a country, completelyy disregarded anything resembeling rights or legal process, they could not break the cell based structure. Even if you get lucky and capture a guy who knows a name or two outside his cell, by the time you get it out of him, the names he knew will be worthless, as will the contact information he had. The minute somebody is captured, word goes out and everbody scatters. In order for the cature to do you any good at all, the guy would have to start blabbing the second you catch him.\n\n \n interesting detail. but i still don't think that alqaeda is infalliable. i have several ideas of how we could give him a good kick in the nuts-financially, logistically, and finally, physically. as of right now, however, i'm going to let them stew so i can figure out a few details.\n \n \nAgain, though, this will do no good, and they know it. The system these guys are using was developed by US. We know that it is very nearly impossible to beat, especially when you are counting on foreign agents to do it for you. Currently, military estimates of Al Quedas membership tops 15,000\n\n \n i'm glad/i hope you aren't in charge of any military matters. it seems like you're content to sit on your XXX and say 'oh dear, this is impossible. why bother trying.'. i can't stand that. the idea of impossible is offensive to me, and here you've said that one slightly complicated thing is impossible. stop it! figure out a way to fix it, if nothing else. or i'll do that, and you figure out a way to implement it, if you'd like.\n \n you seem to know a great deal about what you're talking about, but you need to go back in the history books and read between the lines a bit to see all the 'impossible' tasks that were accomplished anyway, and to hell with the people who said it couldn't be done.\n \n some examples: the invention of the gun (a weapon that a single man can carry that can pierce a knights armor at 30 yards with a little ball? get outta here!), the invention of the airplane (man wasn't destined to fly! its a simple fact!) man going into space (we'll never know whats out there, it's simply impossible!) the telephone (you can only hear somebodies voice as far as they can yell). all of those things weren't accomplished by people who thought they were impossible, they were done by people who knew it had to be possible, and to hell with being conventional.",

   "see? progress. the only problem i see is getting the damn aclu to look the other way when the badass boys in black go in to 'obtain information' from the one who knows where the other cells are.\n\n \n Despite their comlete distain for human rights, the Soviets never managed to break the structure in over 30 years.\n \n \nAnd on a side note, this is a more primitive form of the cell structure used by the french resistance during world war 2: each person only knew at most 3 people, and at the very bottom, they only knew one: their superior. every man or woman was, in essence, an independent cell. if you'd like to get introspective, you could say that the CIA didn't teach alqaeda this so that they would be able to break up the cells later if need be.\n\n \n This is ENTIRELY incorrect. First, the syetem used by Al Queda is FAR more advanced that the system used by the French. the frnch resistance was broken into units, and as you noted, the low man on the toem pole often only knew the name of his immediate superior. Beyind this little quirk, the entire orgnaization was based on a tier based heirarchy which more closely resembels a modern corporate org chart than anything else. The entire system was built to protect those higher up the chain of command than the individual The downside to this was that the protections did not flow the otehr way. The nazis had only to take a moderat to high level member, and if they could get them to talk, they could get names of dozens of underlings. At one point, the nazis captured a high level commander and got over 300 names from him. In a single week, and due to the capture of a single person, they crippled the french resistance. This birngs us to the second problem in the French Resistance. Contact within the organisation was minimal. Unless absolutly necessary, you DID NOT contact anybody else in the organization. The problem with this is that once the arrests start, you have no way of knowing.\n \n AQ, on the other hand, is using a true cell based organization chart. No matter what level of the organization a person is on, they can only give you a few names. In addition, when the CIA desgined the system currently being used by AQ, they learned from the mistakes of the french. They encourage close contact with those in your cell, as well as close contact between cell leaders and their paymasters.\n \n This being the case, if someboyd suddenly drops out of sight for 24 hours, the word can be gotten out and everbody can go to ground. If one was lookinf for a terrorist cell in the US, you would not look for individuals loosely connected. You woul be looking for 3-6 arab men all living in the same apartment complex who have daily contact. they woud likely work in close proximity to each other as well if possible. 1 guy gets nicked, and everybody knows. He only has to hold out under interrogation for 24 hours. By then, the structure of the organization will have changed and the information he is able to provide is worthless.\n \n \n \ninteresting detail. but i still don't think that alqaeda is infalliable. i have several ideas of how we could give him a good kick in the nuts-financially, logistically, and finally, physically. as of right now, however, i'm going to let them stew so i can figure out a few details.\n\n \n Once you get it worked out, you might want to let the russians know, they have been trying for over 30 years. You might also contact the CIA and let them know that their thus far inpenetrable system is easily defeated. LAst, but not least, you should probably give Bush a call, since they apparently have no idea how to defeat it.\n \n If you would like, you can bounce your ideas off me here. As I said before, I taught the system at WHINSEC. I still have teh course materials. There are several chapters on concepts that have been tried and failed, including explanation regarding why they failed. I would hate for you waste the time of the pesident, CIA, and Soviets with a plan that has already been tried and failed. \n \n \n \ni'm glad/i hope you aren't in charge of any military matters. it seems like you're content to sit on your XXX and say 'oh dear, this is impossible. why bother trying.'. i can't stand that. the idea of impossible is offensive to me, and here you've said that one slightly complicated thing is impossible. stop it! figure out a way to fix it, if nothing else. or i'll do that, and you figure out a way to implement it, if you'd like.\n\n \n If it was only slightly complicated, they would have figured outhow to defeat it years ago. Everytime it has been used in the past, the cell bsed orgnaization has prevailed, adn the agressor/guys trying to beat the org chart have always turned to increasingly brutal measures in an attempt to defeat it. This is also included in the CIAs plan. Thes brutal measures employed help drive membership in your network. \n \n \nyou seem to know a great deal about what you're talking about, but you need to go back in the history books and read between the lines a bit to see all the 'impossible' tasks that were accomplished anyway, and to hell with the people who said it couldn't be done.\n\n \n Maybe you need to go back and look at all the times people said something was impossible and it was. They far outnumber the times that people claimed something was impossible and it turned out not to be. \n \n The world is full of people who say things like \"impossible is not in my vocabulary\". XXXXXX with poor vocabularies no doubt. While refusing to accept that some things are impossible may be a somewhat romantic, idealistic viewpoint, is is also idiotic.\n \n \nsome examples: the invention of the gun (a weapon that a single man can carry that can pierce a knights armor at 30 yards with a little ball? get outta here!), the invention of the airplane (man wasn't destined to fly! its a simple fact!) man going into space (we'll never know whats out there, it's simply impossible!) the telephone (you can only hear somebodies voice as far as they can yell). all of those things weren't accomplished by people who thought they were impossible, they were done by people who knew it had to be possible, and to hell with being conventional\n\n \n These were scientific advancements. That is a whole different ballgame. Besides, most of the advancements you cite here were never labeled impossible.",

   "The proble is that this WILL NOT work. Al Queda, indeed most major terrorist organisations operating today, ae using the cell based structure that the CIA developed in the late 50s and early 60s as an ideal structure for resistance cells against soviet occupation. It is undefeatable...\n\n I can certainly see how such an organization would be very hard to break apart - but NOT impossible. After all, there have been a number of successes. Quoting from the first web site I just came across in a Google search: \"Law enforcement has broken up al-Qaeda cells in the United Kingdom, the United States, Italy, France, Spain, Germany, Albania, Uganda, and elsewhere. \" (from http://cfrterrorism.org/groups/alqaeda.html, which seems to be a good site about Al Qaeda in general). There is another good though old link I just found on that same Google search that goes into some more detail about the successes in tracking down Al Qaeda agents:\n http://www.strategypage.com/dls/articles/20030303.asp\n Just to quote a few paragraphs from that source (dated March 2003):\n \nAl Qaeda has been taken apart, since September 11, 2001, more dramatically than is generally known. This is partly the result of the thousands of al Qaeda member killed in Afghanistan in late 2001. The information picked up in Afghanistan, plus what we already knew, led to the arrest of over 3,000 al Qaeda members in the last 18 months. The March 1st arrest, in Pakistan, of al Qaeda terrorism planner Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, is another indication of how much al Qaeda has been penetrated by these aggressive intelligence operations. Last year, there were several cases, that made the news, of al Qaeda members, or supporters being arrested because of American agents infiltrating the organization. Interrogations of over 3,000 terrorism suspects since September 11, 2001 has provided enough information to infiltrate terrorist organizations, or convincingly impersonate terrorist supporters. \n ...\n Al Qaeda's cellular organization makes it harder to shut down, but easier to infiltrate. The relatively isolated cells have to be careful how they communicate, as it is widely known that the United States is very capable when it comes to listening in to any kind of electronic communications, and tracking down people using phones and Internet. Thus it is easy for an agent to walk into a Mosque and use a plausible cover story to establish connections with an existing cell. With communications with other cells so difficult, it is usually not possible to check a new members background story thoroughly. \n \n Moreover, the al Qaeda cells also have Islamic charities that they depend on for funding, and these are also vulnerable to infiltration via compromised cells. The charity organizations have been the victim of sting operations, where charity organization leaders have been lured to Europe, by fake donors, for meetings to discuss large contributions. Outside of their Middle Eastern sanctuaries (Yemen and Lebanon in particular), arrests can be easily made. \n \n The stings, deceptions, electronic eavesdropping, interrogations and field work by the CIA and Special Forces in places like Afghanistan and Pakistan have combined to shut down dozens of al Qaeda cells already. But some that have been identified have probably been infiltrated rather than shut down. All of this work has to take place in the shadows, for al Qaeda members get most of their information about the progress of anti-terrorism operations from the media. Reporting details of how al Qaeda cells are being investigated and compromised just warns al Qaeda members about what they are up against. \n \nI'm not saying that it is not a difficult task, but there has been much more success in tracking the terrorist threat at its source than you seem to acknowledge. Things may be bad, but not hopeless. After all, if things were as bad as you say, then I would think that we would have had at least one successful terrorist attack within the US since September 11.\n \nI doubt that the Us could get away with it again. first, if the new governemtn of Iraq ends up closely alinged with Iran, it seems reasonable to assume that Iraq would be included in Iran and Syrias new alliance. Second, the Iraqis are already working on rebuilding their military. With the US supposedly backing the new government, we cannot exaclty go out of our way to keep our EU allies and the russians from selling Iraq new weapons. The Iraqis are buying british tanks, french helicopters, EU fighters and russian intercept missile systems. Invading raq again would not be such an easy task. Besides, you really think the international community would stand for us invading the nation that we just liberated in order to depose the governmetn that we just installed? besides it not flying on the international stage, it would be a foreign policy nightmare since it would essentially be a confirmation of what the rest of the wqorld has been claiming all along....that this was one big mistake.\n\n Most countries were against our attacking Iraq because we did not have a just reason. If a country is harboring terrorists that are actively attacking the US, even if that country was originally set up democratically with the help of the US, then even our previous oponents would have to admit that an attack would be justified. After all, I may be wrong, but I don't remember hearing much protest about our military involvement in Afghanistan, which was harboring America-attacking terrorists. As to whether or not we would take the risk, I think, as with Afghanistan, a large majority of Americans would be supportive of such an attack if it could truly be proven that they do harbor terrorists that are attacking the US (I don't think Bush saying \"trust me\" would work any more). The only concern I would have is if Iran did manage to complete a nuclear weapons program and was willing to risk its own safety by threatening the US with nuclear retaliation for our potential re-invasion of Iraq.\n \nAs time passes, you stop viewing any Iraqi as a civilain and see them all as possible insurgents. When misjudging somebodies intentions brings the possibility of death, you shoot first and ask questions later. \n\n This is the type of problem that arises when you attack an unwilling people, claiming that it is for their own good - as in Vietnam and, now, in Iraq. At least in World War II, it was pretty clear that most people wanted to be freed by the Allies from German occupation. The support of the Iraqi people was never as clear.\n \nAs far as I can tell, the two party system and the failure of people to act on their outrage pretty much kills off any real possibility of grassroots change, especially now that the ideaologies of the two parties have become so close as to be nearly indiscernable.\n Well, I guess we'll simply have to agree to disagree about how desperate the situation is from the point of view of public power. It could well be that, years from now, I will become just as disillusioned as you seem to be, but I haven't reached that point yet. Even once I and those in my generation (Generation X) do get disillusioned and step away from political action, I hope that fresher, more idealistic people will come in to fill the gap of political activism. The fight needs to go on, no matter what the odds.",

This is hardly a resounding sucess. \n \n Infiltration of cells can be done, but it basically gets you nowhere, since nobody in any particular cell has more than the names of the people in their cell, and possibly contact information for a paymaster. Even the capture of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, who was undeniably one of AQs top officials netted us no useful intelligence. As soon as he was arrested, al quedas ornagization shifted to the point that the information he held was worthless. Using the cell based structure, even he would not have known the names and locations of anybody but his immediate contacts. \n \n \nJust to quote a few paragraphs from that source (dated March 2003):\n I'm not saying that it is not a difficult task, but there has been much more success in tracking the terrorist threat at its source than you seem to acknowledge. Things may be bad, but not hopeless. After all, if things were as bad as you say, then I would think that we would have had at least one successful terrorist attack within the US since September 11.\n\n \n Why? Bin ladens staed goal is not the destruction of the United States militarily, but our economic destruction and removal from the middle east. Since the 9/11 attacks we have spent over 10 TRILLION dollars on homeland security and counter terrorism activities. In a declinign economy, 10 trillion is a HUGE amount to spend on such things. BL also has expressed that attacks ont eh US homeland are not the most effective means of meeting AQ's goals, since money we spend on homeland security stays in our economy. They have instead opted to draw our military out, effectivley forcing us to spend our money internationally.\n \n Here is Bin laden explaining Al Quedas strategy:\n \n \nAll that we have mentioned has made it easy for us to provoke and bait this administration. All that we have to do is to send two mujahidin to the furthest point east to raise a piece of cloth on which is written al-Qaida, in order to make the generals race there to cause America to suffer human, economic, and political losses without their achieving for it anything of note other than some benefits for their private companies. \n \n This is in addition to our having experience in using guerrilla warfare and the war of attrition to fight tyrannical superpowers, as we, alongside the mujahidin, bled Russia for 10 years, until it went bankrupt and was forced to withdraw in defeat.\n\n \n This is it. They have no need to destroy the United states, or even to attack within the US directly to achieve these goals. For years before the 9/11 attacks, they hit us internationally, but we failed to respond. The 9/11 attacks were engineered to force a response.\n \n \nSo we are continuing this policy in bleeding America to the point of bankruptcy. Allah willing, and nothing is too great for Allah. \n \n That being said, those who say that al-Qaida has won against the administration in the White House or that the administration has lost in this war have not been precise, because when one scrutinises the results, one cannot say that al-Qaida is the sole factor in achieving those spectacular gains. \n \n Rather, the policy of the White House that demands the opening of war fronts to keep busy their various corporations - whether they be working in the field of arms or oil or reconstruction - has helped al-Qaida to achieve these enormous results. \n \n And so it has appeared to some analysts and diplomats that the White House and us are playing as one team towards the economic goals of the United States, even if the intentions differ.\n \n \n \n \n Again, economic warfare, as well as handing a portion of the credit for AQ's victory to the Bush administration for being so easy to draw along and for opening of mutiple wars. He is also correct here that some US sorporations are getting fat off the proceeds of these wars. Frankly, I think it is foolish of the American people to fail to consider the prifitability fator involved in warfare.\n \n \nAnd it was to these sorts of notions and their like that the British diplomat and others were referring in their lectures at the Royal Institute of International Affairs. [When they pointed out that] for example, al-Qaida spent $500,000 on the event, while America, in the incident and its aftermath, lost - according to the lowest estimate - more than $500 billion.\n \n Meaning that every dollar of al-Qaida defeated a million dollars by the permission of Allah, besides the loss of a huge number of jobs.\n \n As for the size of the economic deficit, it has reached record astronomical numbers estimated to total more than a trillion dollars. \n \n \n \n Ok, it is an old speech (which, IMO, makes it twice as sad that we are still playing BL's game). Over 1 trillion per year is being spent on homeland security, in addition to the nearly 1 trillion dollars that Iraq and Afghnaistan have cost us in both direct costs (military interventionaism) and indirect costs (lost time, bribes for \"allies\", etc...) This does not even mention the polticial costs, such as the fact that since 9/11, US troops have been ordered out of Saudi Arabia, The EU has alinged itself closely with syria and Iraqn, the Russians are selling Syria weapons and building nuke reactors for Iran despite vocal opposition from the US.\n \n Taking into account that this is BL's strategy, why take the bad PR, as well as the expense, that comes with another strike on the US homeland? We are doing exactly what he wants. We have deposed Saddams secular government and installed one dominated by islamic fundamentalists. Our ties with the saudis are effectively dead from a political standpoint. We can not even talk syria into removing troops from lebanon. Our controll of the middle east is effectively dead. Nobody is willing to back our plays.\n \n AND, the money just keeps going down the drain.\n \n Thus far, everything AQ has done has made perfect sense and has been masterfully planned if you keep in mind that their goal is our financial downfall. Following the start of the Iraqi war, a war that was certian to be incredibly expensive, they did not attack us directly, they attacked thosew who had been foolish enough to join to coalition. the attack in spain was a turning point in that regards. Following the Spanish attack, including the statements from AQ that they would basically offer amnesty to coalition countriess that either pulled out of Iraq or significantly reduced their participation there. As a result, over the next 6 months the number of non US troops in Iraq was cut in half, and ALL foreign financial assistance for the invasion was withdrawn. We were left footing the bill for the entire invasion and occupation by ourselves, and we will be stuck paying for the entire rebuilding process. \n \n \n \nMost countries were against our attacking Iraq because we did not have a just reason. If a country is harboring terrorists that are actively attacking the US, even if that country was originally set up democratically with the help of the US, then even our previous oponents would have to admit that an attack would be justified. After all, I may be wrong, but I don't remember hearing much protest about our military involvement in Afghanistan, which was harboring America-attacking terrorists. As to whether or not we would take the risk, I think, as with Afghanistan, a large majority of Americans would be supportive of such an attack if it could truly be proven that they do harbor terrorists that are attacking the US (I don't think Bush saying \"trust me\" would work any more). The only concern I would have is if Iran did manage to complete a nuclear weapons program and was willing to risk its own safety by threatening the US with nuclear retaliation for our potential re-invasion of Iraq.\n\n \n Afghanistan was a different situation. They were not merely harboring terrorists, the whole place was being run by terrorists. BL was wessentially the secretary of defense, and while not all AQ members were members of the taliban, ALL members of the taliban were AQ members. \n \n Any state would be foolish to actively support terrorists. At the same time, the old model of state sponsered terrorism is dead. All terrorists need from states is for them to look the other way, and most states are more then willing to do it in order to avoid their wrath.\n \n Look at pakistan. WE KNOW thre are AQ cells, including AQ leadership operating out of afghanistan. We also KNOw where some of these are, but cannot go in and get them because the pakistanis will not allow it. Already the president of pakistan spends the majority of his time dodging assasination attempts and ferreting out coup plans from within his own ranks. The last thing he wants is an organization like AQ targeting him as well. so, they allow, and even participate int he arrest of some individuals so they can say \"LOOK, we are helping\", while essentiall protecting, or at least ignoring, the huge organization that has been built up.\n \n I think in order to convince the international community that another pre-emptive war is justified, especially one based on suspected terrorist ties, we would have to show irrefutable evidence of direct state supported terrorism, and I just don't see it happening. \n \n \nThis is the type of problem that arises when you attack an unwilling people, claiming that it is for their own good - as in Vietnam and, now, in Iraq. At least in World War II, it was pretty clear that most people wanted to be freed by the Allies from German occupation. The support of the Iraqi people was never as clear.\n\n \n Exactly, which is why things have become such a mess.,",

It doesn't work. It just turns the population against you, effectively bolstering the ranks of your enemy. Also, it led to incresed losses int he russian ranks since such a strtegy brings snipers out of the woodwork, and snipers in such a situation learn rather quikly that as long as they just take a single shot, it is impossible for the enemy to pinpoint their position. \n \n The absolute LAST THING you want in an urban combat situation is for your enemy to start sniping at you. \n \n \nthats the rough concept of my idea, as it stands. its not feasable in its current form, and i know that, so saying 'thats stupid it won't work' is a free ticket to being ignored.\n\n \n I am not saying it is stupid and won't work, merely that it has been tried and does not work, and that you have us doing it in the wrong country. While AQ has effectively been run out of Afghanistan, they have cells in over 100 nations that we know of. I think that when we besieg london and paris, they british and the french are going to have somethign to say about it, and it is not going to be nice.\n \n \n \ni'd like to see your sources on this. i'm something of a ww2 buff, and i've never seen anything even close to that number. however, its a moot point: i'm sure if we captured bin laden, we'd cripple AQ simply because of the number of names he'd have. so far as i know, all we've done with the AQ leaders so far is to simply kill them and ask their families questions. i'm not saying i know everything, i'm simply saying that this is what i've seen released to the public and some of my private sources.\n\n \n You might do a little more research into the french resistance. As romanticised as we make the whole thing, they were largely ineffective and their organization sucked.\n \n As another pointed out, and linked an article, we have thus far interrogated over 3000 terrorist suspects worldwide. We have kept roughly 300-400 of them in prison. As I pointed out, caturing, and interrogating them does little or no good, since within 24 hours everything they knew has changed.\n \n \n \nfirst, the russians have no problems in the middle east. whens the last time you heard of russians being held hostage? they don't get captured because the taliban knows what will happen. i only have this from once source, and i'm not entirely sure its a source i trust all the way, but a taliban warlord captured and held a few russians as hostage. within two hours, the spetsnaz were mobilized, and the next day, the taliban leaders brother was found in front of his house with his throat slit ear to ear. the hostages were released, and as far as i know, there haven't been any problems for the russians since\n\n \n The taliban was soley located in afghanistan, the coutry that the russians were at war with for 9 years. The taliban and their allies beat the russians using the cell based structure were are talking about and then the Taliban seized power in afghanistan. Your source sucks, there is no such thing as a \"taliban warlord\". You haev the taliban, and you have the warlords. there are not warlords who are in the taliban. Besides, there have been russian hostages taken in Iraq, AND spetsnaz are not hostage rescue guys. It was spetsnaz troops that stormed the school held by chechen rebels. They killed half the civilians in the school in the crossfire. This is how the russians do hostage recovery. If the spetsnaz had tried such a mission, the russian hostages would have also been killed, and the house leveled.\n \n \nsecond: the cia does NOT give out its secrets, i garuntee. it doesn't even let out things that AREN'T secrets: for example, there was an old sixties spy show where there was a device called the 'bubble of silence' to keep any room from being bugged (think a fish tank with a set of microphons inside turned upside down and two people poke their heads in to talk). the cia has this right now, because- and i quote- \"you didn't really think we'd let something like that get away, did you?\". the CIA is FAR too paranoid to let out their deepest secrets, even when communists are involved. i garuntee that the cell structure used by the taliban is second rate, and is only effective because the first rate secrets have died with their inventors.\n\n \n We specifically developed the system to to teach otehr people how to use it. It was never meant to be used by the US, but rather by local populations to fight the soviets. IT is kind of a pandoras box situation. We developed this GREAT system to ensure that your network is undefeatable, now they are using it against us. Maybe its time to dit back and go \"Hmmm, maybe teaching the islamic fundamentalists how to organise themselves into undefeatable cell structures, and then arming them was not such a hot idea\". Of course, that could be followed by \"hmm, maybe helping saddam seize power and then arming him with chemical and biological weapons was not such a hot idea\".\n \n I don't know why america keeps doing these things that keep coming around and biting us on the butt, I can only imagine it is because we apparently completely lack the knack for long term planning, so it never occurs to us that supporting tyrants may very well come back to haunt us.",

Over the past 30-years the CIA, once a premier intelligence gatherer and policy positioning entity, turned into just another federal bureaucracy after the job security, salaries, benefits and retirement. Originally conceived and managed by men and women of wealth, privilege and a sense of duty who attracted superior subordinates, they were risk takers who got the job done. When you replace individuals with those unique qualifications using common people chasing the elusive American Dream, political manipulation and bureaucratic mediocrity become the norm. That seems indicative of most other federal branches, including much of the military, especially when considering that serving the public was originally considered an honor, not a gravy train to retirement.

   "Why? Bin ladens staed goal is not the destruction of the United States militarily, but our economic destruction and removal from the middle east. Since the 9/11 attacks we have spent over 10 TRILLION dollars on homeland security and counter terrorism activities. In a declinign economy, 10 trillion is a HUGE amount to spend on such things. BL also has expressed that attacks ont eh US homeland are not the most effective means of meeting AQ's goals, since money we spend on homeland security stays in our economy. They have instead opted to draw our military out, effectivley forcing us to spend our money internationally.\n ...\n Taking into account that this is BL's strategy, why take the bad PR, as well as the expense, that comes with another strike on the US homeland? We are doing exactly what he wants. We have deposed Saddams secular government and installed one dominated by islamic fundamentalists. Our ties with the saudis are effectively dead from a political standpoint. We can not even talk syria into removing troops from lebanon. Our controll of the middle east is effectively dead. Nobody is willing to back our plays.\n\n I can agree that the Al Qaeda attacks have ended up costing us quite a bit of money and political influence in the middle east, but not all of that would have been predictable by Bin Ladin while he was planning the World Trade Center attacks. Iraq was not a terrorist threat to us and even someone as clever as Bin Ladin may not have been sure that Bush would have been able to attack Iraq under the false pretext of fighting terrorism. It was the Iraq war, not that of Afghanistan (which was a direct result of the Al Qaeda attack), that has cost us the political clout in the middle east and in the world. We have effectively done the political damage to ourselves through our unjustified attack on Iraq. I don't think that the war in Afghanistan carried much political damage. As to cost, how do you come up with the $10 trillion cost? Can you supply a link that explains the cost? Also, I have to admit that my main worry with respect to Al Qaeda and other terrorists has always been the thought that they could launch another, potentially larger or even nuclear attack on innocent civilians in the U.S. If that is no longer their goal, then it is a bit of a relief to me.\n \nAny state would be foolish to actively support terrorists. At the same time, the old model of state sponsered terrorism is dead. All terrorists need from states is for them to look the other way, and most states are more then willing to do it in order to avoid their wrath.\n\n I think we simply have a bit of miscommunication. I thought you were equating \"terrorist haven\" with a state that actively sponsors terrorism. I think we both agree, then, that any state that actively sponsors terrorism would be foolish to do so. I agree that terrorists can exist in a state that does not take enough action to stop them, though I do not think that they would be as affective as Al Qaeda was able to be in an openly supportive state such as Afghanistan. Saudi Arabia has certainly allowed extremist elements to dominate their educational system and teach many youth to hate the West and, though this has stopped short of actual terrorist training, it has certainly generated a lot of potential terrorists. However, I think, after having experienced their own terrorist attacks, the Saudi's are starting to wake up to the threat.",

Nothing could be further from the truth. War appropriations only cover immediate, direct costs of the war. They do not cover readiness recovery costs. Rediness recovery is basically replacing munitions and equipment that we expend during the course of the war. Here are some examples:\n \n During the course of JUST the war in Iraq, we dropped:\n \n 761 BLU 109 (bunker busters) ($7,837,539)\n 2714 GBU 10's (advanced guided bomb) ($67,092,794)\n 4993 GBU 15's (advanced laser guided bomb) ($1,122,840,020)\n 219 GBU 28's (well amke this simple, GBU stands fro guided bomb unit) ($22,053,081)\n 1,181 GBU 24 variants (A, B, or C) ($71,617,021)\n 784 GBU 7 ($55,977,600)\n \n We also launched over 2000 tomahawk missiles. ($175 million)\n \n The appropriations numbers also do not take into account the 9 blackhawks we have lost either to enemy fire or accidents ($93,600,000), or the Global hawk that we lost ($68,000,000) or the 6 predators we lost ($84,000,000), or the 107 patriot missiles that we either lost or gave to israel and saudi arabia to defend against potential missile attacks during the invasion ($518,950,000.....thats right, patriots cost 4.85 million each).\n \n Just with this very limited list of armament ( the guided missiels listed are ONLY air force munitions) and this VERY limited list of equipment lost, we can add an additional 2,222,518,055. That is over 2 BILLION dollars added to the bottom line, anbd you havent even accounted for the 27 abrams tanks that we have lost or have been damaged beyond repair, the APCs we have lost, hummers, hell, at this point, you havent even put bullets in your soldiers guns yet. Add 40% to those numbers for debt service and interest (remember, we are charging all this to a credit card).\n \n I would imagine that even if we froze Iraq related spending RIGHT NOW, indirect costs of the war such as readiness recovery would put our expediture at over $750 billion. \n \n \n There is a page at http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/usaf/docs/munition-cost-11-1.htm that shows air force ordnance acquisition costs. \n \n \n \n \nI think we simply have a bit of miscommunication.

I don't think we will see this unless we put too much heat on Iran and Syria. If war looks emminent, I have no doubt that both countries would see terrosist attacks as a viable tactic and start fully supporting anti american terrorists. \n \n In truth, the state supported model of terrorism is as good as dead. At one time, terrorists needed the kind of connecitons that came with state sponsorship. Now it seems that they do just fine on their own andusing their multi billion dollar oil sheik friends to provide needed connections.",

($175 million)\n \n The appropriations numbers also do not take into account the 9 blackhawks we have lost either to enemy fire or accidents ($93,600,000), or the Global hawk that we lost ($68,000,000) or the 6 predators we lost ($84,000,000), or the 107 patriot missiles that we either lost or gave to israel and saudi arabia to defend against potential missile attacks during the invasion ($518,950,000.....thats right, patriots cost 4.85 million each).\n \n Just with this very limited list of armament ( the guided missiels listed are ONLY air force munitions) and this VERY limited list of equipment lost, we can add an additional 2,222,518,055. That is over 2 BILLION dollars added to the bottom line, anbd you havent even accounted for the 27 abrams tanks that we have lost or have been damaged beyond repair, the APCs we have lost, hummers, hell, at this point, you havent even put bullets in your soldiers guns yet. Add 40% to those numbers for debt service and interest (remember, we are charging all this to a credit card).\n \n I would imagine that even if we froze Iraq related spending RIGHT NOW, indirect costs of the war such as readiness recovery would put our expediture at over $750 billion. \n \n \n There is a page at http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/usaf/docs/munition-cost-11-1.htm that shows air force ordnance acquisition costs. \n \n\n Of course, the numbers you quote are large - $2.2 billion for the examples you quoted, and $750 billion for indirect costs of the war, but all of these are small compared to the $10 TRILLION cost you mentioned. I could believe $1 Trillion, maybe even $2 trillion, but I just don't see the numbers adding up to $10 trillion which, after all, is 10,000 billion, or 1,000,000 million. Perhaps, the author is adding internal security costs that we would be spending anyway, including costs of running the FBI and CIA. Could you summarize the major cost groups that add up to $10 trillion - ex. Iraq war direct $200 billion, indirect $750 billion, internal security $1 trillion, etc. (I'm just making up numbers as an example here). I agree that $10 trillion would make quite an appreciable dent. Our current debt is about $7.7 trillion. However, $1 trillion, large as it is, could be absorbed by the economy without too much damage. Many of those costs might already be covered by existing expenditure allocations that are covered by tax input, and may not result in added debt. After all, where does all the money go that we have paid into the military for all of these decades if not mainly into the costs of equipment, ordinance, planes, tanks, etc.",

I think the only thing our military has ever obsoleted is mule pack saddles, and I'm sure those are in warehouses somewhere.\n\n I did not say that $1 trillion would be easy to absorb, just that it would not cause \"too much\" damage. I am comparing this to Bin Ladin's stated goal of bankrupting the US or causing severe economic hardship (severe, in my mind, being equated with something akin to the Great Depression). Even a significant part of that $1 trillion cost may have already been taken into account in our federal budget. The military budget (~$400 billion a year, not counting the extra appropriations for the Iraq war) assumes a certain \"consumption\" on the part of the military of weapons, vehicles, ordinance, etc. After all, if our military never actually fought in wars, then its supply would not constantly be tapped and its costs to us, the taxpayers, would be much less than it currently is.\n \n The economy has certainly had its problems in the last few years but the war on terrorism is not the main cause of these problems. I was working in the telecommunications sector, which started to take a nosedive several months before September 11. The Dow-Jones and NASDAQ averages also started falling long before the Al Qaeda attack, showing that many industries were losing their profitability for causes completely unrelated to terrorism.\n \n Yes, there were a few industries which were affected by terrorism. The airline industry is one. Tourism is more of a mixture, since much of the decrease in foreign visitors would have been offset by the increase in Americans taking their vacations domestically instead of travelling abroad. Anyway, I wouldn't think that the few examples of such industries would amount to more than several billion dollars - a drop in the bucket compared to 1 trillion.",

   "Here's an article I read today about the effect of a decline in tourists on the US economy:\n \n \n\n Tourism to the U.S. becomes a casualty in war on terror \n \n Rasulo and other travel executives said tourism to the United States, while rising again after several down years, is not as robust as it should be, with an estimated 10 per cent fewer international visitors in 2004 than in 2000. Although the weak dollar has brought more visitors in recent months, the overall trend is still disappointing to the industry. \n \n The stakes involved are huge. Visitors from abroad accounted for about $93.5 billion US in spending and economic activity  in the United States in 2004, according to Commerce Department estimates. That's slightly larger than U.S. exports of automobiles, engines and parts. \n \n Tourism officials ascribe the decline partly to anti-Americanism that arose after the country launched military action in Afghanistan and Iraq and to the \"hassle factor\" associated with new visa application and airport security procedures. \n \n Dennis Murphy, a spokesman for the Homeland Security Department, said the new procedures are intended to correct vulnerabilities exploited by the Sept. 11 terrorists, without impeding trade or travel. \"We can't allow our system to be abused again,\" he said. \n \n \n http://www.mytelus.com/travel/article.do?pageID=home&articleID=1851002",

Some people might have postponed travel of any sort all together, but fear of terrorism, in those cases, would only have been part of the reason. The decreased economy, job uncertainty, and layoffs certainly would contribute to people spending less money on travel.",
