What if he were lame? \n \n Way too many Christians, I think, are caught up in the Jesus cult. By way of analogy, I have both a dog and a cat. If I point to a toy with my hand, the dog will follow the line of my hand and fetch the toy. If I try that that with the cat, it will simply stare at my finger.",

   "The Evidence\n \n * Jesus was one of the gentlest people who ever lived. He was no John Wayne. Usually we label such gentle souls pansies no matter what their sexual preference.\n * Jesus totally rejected the masculine code of valour and violence universally espoused in his time. Today such people are called commies, draft dodgers and XXXXXX.\n * Jesus had plenty of opportunity to have sex with women, but he always avoided it. If a modern man did the same, we would assume he was gay.\n * Jesus hung out with disreputable people, including hookers, and all manner of sinners, including sodomites. If a modern man kept such bad company, we would not assume he was 100% heterosexual.\n * Jesus associated almost exclusively with men. He and his friends were physically intimate with each other, putting their heads in each other's laps to dine. If a modern North American male behaved this way, it might raise some eyebrows.\n * Jesus and his male friends like to kiss each other, for example Matthew 26:49. We North Americans are rather inhibited about kissing each other, though Greeks and Russians do it with gusto. If a North American male did this, of course, we would assume he was gay.\n * Jesus's \"groupies\" competed, each claiming to love Jesus the most.\n * John 13:25 tells of John lying with his head on Jesus's breast. Straight men don't do that, at least not in our culture.\n * A group of men met at the Council of Nicea and decided what to include in the Bible and what to censor. We like to assume their decisions were perfect and 100% divinely inspired. However,... There's a suppressed part of the Gospel of Mark quoted in a letter from Clement, Bishop of Alexandria, to Theodore, the priest of an early Christian community, c.95 AD, that goes like this:\n \n \"And thus they come into Bethany, and a certain, woman whose brother had died, was there. And coming she prostrated herself before Jesus and sayeth unto him, 'Son of David have mercy on me'. But the disciples rebuked her.\n \n And Jesus, being angered, went off with her into the garden where the tomb was, and straightway a great cry was heard from the tomb.\n \n And going near, Jesus rolled away the stone from the door of the tomb. And straightway, going in where the youth was, he stretched forth his hand and raised him, seizing his hand.\n \n But the youth, looking upon him, loved him and began to beseech him that he might be with him. And going out of the tomb they came into the house of the youth, for he was rich.\n \n And after six days, Jesus told him what to do and in the evening the youth comes to him, wearing a linen cloth over nakedness. And he remained with him that night, for Jesus taught him the mystery of the Kingdom of God. And thence arising, he returned to the other side of the Jordan.' \n # They took the text from Prof. Morton Smith's Secret Gospel-- not a speculation book, but a scholarly treatise on existing documents. Now, after great part of the Nag Hammadi scrolls has been deciphered, the placement of the excised text within the Gospel of Mark is rather known: it's between Mark 14:11-12. Compare to John 11-12. It's likely there's a part missing in the story. The youth Jesus has raised is Lazarus, who's mentioned by name in the Gospel of John.\n # The extant text in the standard version of Mark narrating the arrest of Jesus, contains the curious verses (14:51-52):\n \n \"And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body ; and the young men laid hold on him:\n \n And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.\" \n \n which bears no relationship to the rest of the story unless something else is missing. If a modern man were caught in a park with a naked youth, he would have quite some explaining to do to the vice squad.\n # On the Kinsey scale, about one in ten people is considered homosexual. This means approximately 10% of the people mentioned in the Bible were homosexual too, using the modern standard. Some were open, like David and Jonathan. Some were closeted like Paul. There must be a great many more of them. The most likely candidates are Jesus, Lazarus, Ruth and James, and perhaps all the apostles. Since standards of behaviour were different in those days, and since the very concept homosexual was not even invented, of course these people would not have identified themselves as gay. They would have just felt they had extremely deep love or friendship for people of the same sex.\n \n \n Note the other sins punishable by death in the old testament:\n \n * not being Jewish (Deuteronomy 17:2)\n * sex before marriage (Deuteronomy 22:13)\n * refusal to obey your parents (Deuteronomy 21:18)\n * gathering firewood on Sunday (Numbers 15:32)\n * eating lobster (Leviticus 11:9)\n http://mindprod.com/religion/wasjesusgay.html",

And kneeling before him they mocked him, saying, \"Hail, King of the Jews!\" 30 And they spat upon him, and took the reed and struck him on the head. 31 And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe, and put his own clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him.\n\n look closely at the verses 20 to 25. i think you just might find a slight hint of the jewish influence in jesus' crucifixion",

   "you guys got to be joking...\n \n mark 15\n \n1 And as soon as it was morning the chief priests, with the elders and scribes, and the whole council held a consultation; and they bound Jesus and led him away and delivered him to Pilate. 2 And Pilate asked him, \"Are you the King of the Jews?\" And he answered him, \"You have said so.\" 3 And the chief priests accused him of many things. 4 And Pilate again asked him, \"Have you no answer to make? See how many charges they bring against you.\" 5 But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate wondered. 6 Now at the feast he used to release for them one prisoner for whom they asked. 7 And among the rebels in prison, who had committed murder in the insurrection, there was a man called Barab'bas. 8 And the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he was wont to do for them. 9 And he answered them, \"Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?\" 10 For he perceived that it was out of envy that the chief priests had delivered him up. 11 But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release for them Barab'bas instead. 12 And Pilate again said to them, \"Then what shall I do with the man whom you call the King of the Jews?\" 13 And they cried out again, \"Crucify him.\" 14 And Pilate said to them, \"Why, what evil has he done?\" But they shouted all the more, \"Crucify him.\" 15 So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released for them Barab'bas; and having scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.\n\n \n luke 23\n \n1 Then the whole company of them arose, and brought him before Pilate. 2 And they began to accuse him, saying, \"We found this man perverting our nation, and forbidding us to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ a king.\" 3 And Pilate asked him, \"Are you the King of the Jews?\" And he answered him, \"You have said so.\" 4 And Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, \"I find no crime in this man.\" 5 But they were urgent, saying, \"He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, from Galilee even to this place.\" 6 When Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean. 7 And when he learned that he belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him over to Herod, who was himself in Jerusalem at that time. 8 When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, for he had long desired to see him, because he had heard about him, and he was hoping to see some sign done by him. 9 So he questioned him at some length; but he made no answer. 10 The chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing him. 11 And Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him; then, arraying him in gorgeous apparel, he sent him back to Pilate. 12 And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before this they had been at enmity with each other. 13 Pilate then called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, 14 and said to them, \"You brought me this man as one who was perverting the people; and after examining him before you, behold, I did not find this man guilty of any of your charges against him; 15 neither did Herod, for he sent him back to us. Behold, nothing deserving death has been done by him; 16 I will therefore chastise him and release him.\" 17 18 19 a man who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection started in the city, and for murder. 20 Pilate addressed them once more, desiring to release Jesus; 21 but they shouted out, \"Crucify, crucify him!\" 22 A third time he said to them, \"Why, what evil has he done? I have found in him no crime deserving death; I will therefore chastise him and release him.\" 23 But they were urgent, demanding with loud cries that he should be crucified. And their voices prevailed. 24 So Pilate gave sentence that their demand should be granted. 25 He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, whom they asked for; but Jesus he delivered up to their will. \n\n \n john 18\n \nThen they led Jesus from the house of Ca'iaphas to the praetorium. It was early. They themselves did not enter the praetorium, so that they might not be defiled, but might eat the passover. 29 So Pilate went out to them and said, \"What accusation do you bring against this man?\" 30 They answered him, \"If this man were not an evildoer, we would not have handed him over.\" 31 Pilate said to them, \"Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.\" The Jews said to him, \"It is not lawful for us to put any man to death.\" 32 This was to fulfil the word which Jesus had spoken to show by what death he was to die. 33 Pilate entered the praetorium again and called Jesus, and said to him, \"Are you the King of the Jews?\" 34 Jesus answered, \"Do you say this of your own accord, or did others say it to you about me?\" 35 Pilate answered, \"Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have handed you over to me; what have you done?\" 36 Jesus answered, \"My kingship is not of this world; if my kingship were of this world, my servants would fight, that I might not be handed over to the Jews; but my kingship is not from the world.\" 37 Pilate said to him, \"So you are a king?\" Jesus answered, \"You say that I am a king. For this I was born, and for this I have come into the world, to bear witness to the truth. Every one who is of the truth hears my voice.\" 38 Pilate said to him, \"What is truth?\" After he had said this, he went out to the Jews again, and told them, \"I find no crime in him. 39 But you have a custom that I should release one man for you at the Passover; will you have me release for you the King of the Jews?\" 40 They cried out again, \"Not this man, but Barab'bas!\" Now Barab'bas was a robber. \n\n john 19\n \n1 Then Pilate took Jesus and scourged him. 2 And the soldiers plaited a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and arrayed him in a purple robe; 3 they came up to him, saying, \"Hail, King of the Jews!\" and struck him with their hands. 4 Pilate went out again, and said to them, \"See, I am bringing him out to you, that you may know that I find no crime in him.\" 5 So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, \"Behold the man!\" 6 When the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, \"Crucify him, crucify him!\" Pilate said to them, \"Take him yourselves and crucify him, for I find no crime in him.\" 7 The Jews answered him, \"We have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because he has made himself the Son of God.\" 8 When Pilate heard these words, he was the more afraid; 9 he entered the praetorium again and said to Jesus, \"Where are you from?\" But Jesus gave no answer. 10 Pilate therefore said to him, \"You will not speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to release you, and power to crucify you?\" 11 Jesus answered him, \"You would have no power over me unless it had been given you from above; therefore he who delivered me to you has the greater sin.\" 12 Upon this Pilate sought to release him, but the Jews cried out, \"If you release this man, you are not Caesar's friend; every one who makes himself a king sets himself against Caesar.\" 13 When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called The Pavement, and in Hebrew, Gab'batha. 14 Now it was the day of Preparation of the Passover; it was about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews, \"Behold your King!\" 15 They cried out, \"Away with him, away with him, crucify him!\" Pilate said to them, \"Shall I crucify your King?\" The chief priests answered, \"We have no king but Caesar.\" 16 Then he handed him over to them to be crucified.\n\n \n all the gospel accounts concur that the jews brought jesus to be killed, accusing him before pilate. all the accounts say that pilate gave into the cries of the people, and gave jesus to the jews to be killed.\n \n did all the gospel writers have ulterior motives as you accused matthew?",

   "JoeBrummer\n * Jesus was one of the gentlest people who ever lived. He was no John Wayne. Usually we label such gentle souls pansies no matter what their sexual preference.\n\n I think his actions in the temple when he overturned the tables and kicked out all the merchants goes against the intent of this assertion. He also stood in the face of the Pharisees and Scribes and called them hypocrites and vipers, confronting them many times with very strong words. Jesus was commanding enough to be the chief shepherd but he was gentle enough to be the Lamb of God. \n \n \n* Jesus totally rejected the masculine code of valour and violence universally espoused in his time. Today such people are called commies, draft dodgers and XXXXXX.\n\n Jesus may have rejected a tradition of violence in a certain sense. I wonder if he would have defended the woman he saved from stoning with force if it would have come to it. Of course, his words of truth were always forceful enough to avoid these types of confrontations. I imagine, though, that he would have possessed that chivalry that called men to defend women. \n \n But we do know that he did not reject the \"masculine code of valor.\" He was a carpenter or laborer after all. He endured a scourging and crowning with thorns. He carried the cross up Calvary--no easy task. Strength, valor, masculinity--it's all there.\n \n \n* Jesus had plenty of opportunity to have sex with women, but he always avoided it. If a modern man did the same, we would assume he was gay.\n\n This assertion that Jesus did not avail himself of the numerous opportunities to have sex with a woman is used as an implication that Jesus was gay. Of course there is no mention of the implication that there is no evidence that Jesus had sex with men although he must have had a lot more opportunities for that since we are told that he was always hanging out with men. (except for the missing excerpt of the gospel of course)\n \n But I think Jesus gives us the answer to whether he was gay in Matthew 19. He conveys to us the way marriage was meant to be. He conveys to us that God created us male and female for a reason. He mentions that man leaves parents to be joined to his wife. There is no mention of man leaving his parents to join to a husband. This idea was not even in the realm of contemplation. He lets us know why he was celibate--for the Kingdom. Sex is a foretaste of our union with God. It is a taste of the divine life, a glimpse of heaven. Because Jesus was God, he was obviously already united with God and he already lived the divine life and knew of heaven.\n \n Matthew 19: 3-12 \"And Pharisees came up to him and tested him by asking, 'Is it lawful to divorce one's wife for any cause?' He answered, 'Have you not read that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, 'For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one'? So they are no longer two but one. What therefore God has joined together, let no man put asunder.' They said to him, 'Why then did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce, and to put her away?' 'He said to them, 'For your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so. And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife, except for unchastity, and marries another, commits adultery; and he who marries a divorced woman, commits adultery.\"\n \n \"The disciples said to him, 'If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is not expedient to marry.' But he said to them, 'Not all men can recive this precept, but only those to whom it is given. For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to receive this, let him receive it.'\"",

It's not like writings were so prolific that there were Book-of-the-Month clubs to join back then. Besides, we know of literature from that period that is lost--so what's to say he wasn't written about?\n \n Also, much of the effects of Christ's life took place after he died, after his disciples' work and writings became more widespread. There would have been less reason for Christ to have been written about, as Christianity before 70 AD was a small sect.\n \n\n \n We have the letter of Philo Judas of ALexandra. We have a lot of history written from that time period. I mean, the 4 gospels had Jesus having this massive following, and doing these miracles all over the place. They mention how amazed how in AWE that Rabbis were with his knowlege. Now, either that is a strong exageration, or it was total fiction. There is a vast silence from any writer about Jesus , aside from the faithful, from before 70 C.E. \n \n Now, there were plenty of writers about John the baptist. Philo of Alexandra mentioned the Essenes in his writings. Since Philo died in 50 C.E. , this was near the time that Jesus was supposed to be around. Why didn't he mention Jesus?\n \n \n\n \n \n So the law dictates they couldn't have a trial during Passover?\n\n \n \n That is correct. They didn't meet on high holy days, or the sabbath. Now, as you might remember, Jesus was arrested by the Romans on the passover meal that was also the Sabbath. He was executed the same day (according to the gospels). \n \n Now, what are the requirements for a trial by the sandrhendren. \n \n From http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/jesus/sanhedrin.html\n \n \n\n Verdicts in Capital Trials Only to be Reached in Daytime \n [Under the Mishnah Tractate, Sanhedrin]\n \n Mishnah Sanhedrin 4.1\n In noncapital cases they hold trial during the daytime and the verdict may be reached during the night; in capital cases they hold the trial during the daytime and the verdict must also be reached during the daytime. In noncapital cases the verdict, whether of acquittal or of conviction, may be reached the same day; in capital cases a verdict of acquittal may be reached on the same day, but a verdict of conviction not until the following day.\n Requirements for Conviction \n \n Mishnah Sanhedrin 5.1-4\n 5.1 They used to prove witnesses with seven inquiries: In what week of years? In what year? In what month? On what day? In what hour? In what place? (R. Jose says: [They aked only,] On what day? In what hour? In what place?) [They also asked:] Do you recognize him? Did you warn him? If a man committed idolatry [they asked the witnesses], What did he worship? and, How did he worship it?\n 2. The more a judge tests the evidence the more he is deserving of praise: Ben Zakkai once tested the evidence even to inquiring about the stalks of figs. Wherein do the inquiries differ from the cross-examination? If to the inquiries one [of the two witnesses] answered, \"I do not know,\" their evidence becomes invalid; but if to the cross-examination one answered, \"We do not know,\" their evidence remains valid. Yet if they contradict one another, whether during the inquiries or the cross-examination, their evidence becomes invalid.\n 3. If one said, \"On the second of the month,\" and the other said, \"On the third,\" their evidence remains valid since one may have known the month was intercalated and the other did not know the month was intercalated; but if one said, \"On the third,\" and the other said, \"On the fifth,\" their evidence becomes invalid. If one said, \"At the second hour,\" and the other said, \"At the third,\" their evidence remains valid; but if one said, \"At the third hour,\" and the other said, \"At the fifth,\" their evidence becomes invalid. R. Judah says: It remains valid; but if one said, \"At the fifth hour,\" and the other said, \"At the seventh,\" their evidence becomes invalid since at the fifth hour the sun in in the east and at the seventh it is in the west.\n 4. They afterward brought in the second witness and proved him. If their words were found to agree together they begin [to examine the evidence] in favor of acquittal. If one witness said, \"I have somewhat to argue in favor of his acquittal,\" or if one of the disciples said, \"I have somewhat to argue in favor of his acquittal,\" they bring him up and set him among them and he does not come down from thence the whole day. If there is any substance in his words they listen to him. Even if the accused said, \"I have somewhat to argue in favor of my acquittal,\" they listen to him, provided there is any substance to his words.\n Postponement of Final Sentence Until the Day After Trial Under the Mishnah\n \n Mishnah Sanhedrin 5.5\n If they found him innocent they set him free; otherwise they leave his sentence over until the morrow. [In the meantime] they went together in pairs, they ate a little (but they used to drink no wine the whole day), and they discussed the matter all night, and early on the morrow they came to the court. He that favored acquittal says: \"I declared him innocent and I still declare him innocent\"; and he that favored conviction says, \"I declared him guilty and I still declare him guilty.\" He that favored conviction may now acquit, but he that had favored acquittal [the day before] may not retract and favor conviction.\"\n Capital Punishment By Stoning \n \n Mishnah Sanhedrin 6.1-4\n 1. When sentence has been passed, they take him forth to stone him. The place of stoning was outside the court, as it is written, Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp. One stands at the door of the court with a towel in his hand, and another, mounted on a horse, far away from him [but where he is able] to see him. If one [in court] said, \"I have somewhat to argue in favor of his acquittal,\" that man waves the towel and the horse runs and stops him [the stoner]. Even if he himself said, \"I have somewhat to argue in favor of my acquittal,\" they must bring him back, be it four times or five, provided that there is any substance in his words. If they found him innocent, they set him free; otherwise he goes forth to be stoned. A herald goes out before him [announcing], \"Such-a-one, the son of such-a-one, is going forth to be stoned for that he committed such or such an offense. Such-a-one and such-a-one are witnesses against him. If any man knoweth anything in favor of his acquittal, come let him plead it.\"\n 2. When he was about ten cubits from the place of stoning they used to say to him, \"Make your confession,\" for such is the way of them that have been condemned to death to make confession, for every one that makes his confession has a share in the world to come. For so we have found it with Achan. Joshua said to him, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the Lord, the God of Israel, and make confession unto him, and tell me now what you have done; hide it not from me. And Achan answered Joshua and said, Of a truth I have sinned against the Lord, the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done. Whence do we learn that his confession made atonement for him? It is written, And Joshua said, Why have you troubled us? The Lord shall trouble thee this day--this day you shall be troubled, but in the world to come you shall not be troubled. If he knows not how to make his confession they say to him, \"Say, May my death be an atonement for all my sins.\" R. Judah says: If he knew that he was condemned because of false testimony he should say, \"Let my death be an atonement for all my sins excepting this sin.\" They said to him: If so, every one would speak after this fashion to show his innocense.\"\n 3. When he was four cubits from the place of stoning, they stripped off his clothes. A man is kept covered in front and a woman both in front and behind. So R. Judah. But the Sages say: a man is stoned naked but a woman is not stoned naked.\n 4. The place of stoning was twice the height of a man. One of the witnesses knocked him down on his loins; if he turned over on his heart the witness turned him over again on his loins. If he straightaway died that sufficed; but if not, the second took the the stone and dropped it on his heart. If he straightaway died, that sufficed; but if not, he was stoned by all Israel, for it is written, The hand of the witnesses shall be firt upon him to put him to death and afterward all the hand of all the people. All that have been stoned must be hanged. So R. Eliezer. But the Sages say: None is hanged save the blasphemer and the idolater. A man is hanged with his face to the people and a woman with her face to the gallows. So R. Eliezer. But the Sages say: A man is hanged but a woman is not hanged. R. Eliezer said to them: Did not Simeon ben Shetah hang women in Ashkelon? They answered: He hanged eighty women, whereas two ought not to be judged in one day. How did they hang a man? They put a beam into the ground and a piece of wood juttted from it. The two hand were brought together and it was hanged. R. Jose days: The beam was made to lean against a wall and one hanged the corpse thereon as butchers do. And they let it down at once: if it remained there overnight a negative command is thereby transgressed, for it is is written, His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shall surely bury him the same day; for he that is hanged is a curse against God; as if to say, Why was this one hanged? Because he blessed the Name, and the Name of Heaven was found profaned.\n \n [Other forms of capital punishment under Jewish law included burning, decapitation, and strangulation, each of which has its own set of crimes meriting such punishment.]\n Crimes Meriting Stoning \n \n Mishnah 7.4\n These are they that are to be stoned: he that has connexion with his mother, his father's wife, his daughter-in-law, a male, or a beast, and the woman that suffers connexion with a beast, and the blasphemer and the idolator, and he that offers any of his seed to Molech, and he that has a familiar spirit and a soothsayer, and he that profanes the Sabbath, and he tht curses his father or his mother, and he that has a connexion with a girl that is betrothed, and he that beguiles [others to commit idolatry], and he that leads [a whole town] astray, and the sorcerer and a stubborn and rebellious son.\n \n",

   "trebor, youre insisting that 4 jewish guys separately recording the biography about jesus, happened to make up the same lie about the trial before his death. there are 2 very wrong things with this picture\n \n first, these guys were jews, just like you are. whats more, they were unfer roman oppression, and they believed in the scriptures that promised the coming of a messiah. generally, the jews that expected the arrival of a messiah were hoping that he would rise up and liberate jerusalem from captivity and give them their independence with him as their king. jesus gave them a different kind of liberation, something that meant more to them than political sovereignty. these guys werent puppets of the roman rule as you are implying. they were in support of the one that claimed to be the messiah to the very end\n \n second, jesus' death was the single most important mission that jesus fulfilled; it was truly the climax of his life story. if you are saying that all the gospels lied about the circumstances of the most significance part of the gospels, then why would you believe anything in the gospels at all? why would you believe that jesus was the son of god, if you are already convinced that they fabricated the trial details? and if they lied about him being the son of god, or doing miracles, or resurrecting, then jesus was a nobody. who cares how he died. if the gospels are all lies, then there was no savior, and whether the jews killed him or not is irrevelevant\n \n you have yet to show that all the gospels were based on a big conspired lie, and that the truth is that the romans killed jesus independent of jewish counsell. you have yet to give a reason why jesus would tick off the romans. youd need to show that the sanhedrin of that time were supportive of jesus, or neutral at best. (and the theme of the scribes and pharisees growing hate towards jesus in consistent throughout all the gospels; unless, as you say, they all lied.) youd have to to bring forth a single source or logical argument to support your position",

   "trebor, youre insisting that 4 jewish guys separately recording the biography about jesus, happened to make up the same lie about the trial before his death. there are 2 very wrong things with this picture\n \n first, these guys were jews, just like you are. whats more, they were unfer roman oppression, and they believed in the scriptures that promised the coming of a messiah. generally, the jews that expected the arrival of a messiah were hoping that he would rise up and liberate jerusalem from captivity and give them their independence with him as their king. jesus gave them a different kind of liberation, something that meant more to them than political sovereignty. these guys werent puppets of the roman rule as you are implying. they were in support of the one that claimed to be the messiah to the very end\n \n second, jesus' death was the single most important mission that jesus fulfilled; it was truly the climax of his life story. if you are saying that all the gospels lied about the circumstances of the most significance part of the gospels, then why would you believe anything in the gospels at all? why would you believe that jesus was the son of god, if you are already convinced that they fabricated the trial details? and if they lied about him being the son of god, or doing miracles, or resurrecting, then jesus was a nobody. who cares how he died. if the gospels are all lies, then there was no savior, and whether the jews killed him or not is irrevelevant\n \n you have yet to show that all the gospels were based on a big conspired lie, and that the truth is that the romans killed jesus independent of jewish counsell. you have yet to give a reason why jesus would tick off the romans. youd need to show that the sanhedrin of that time were supportive of jesus, or neutral at best. (and the theme of the scribes and pharisees growing hate towards jesus in consistent throughout all the gospels; unless, as you say, they all lied.) youd have to to bring forth a single source or logical argument to support your position\n\n \n \n Notice what obvious Child said. Matthew and Luke are based on Mark. You got one person making a claim, then other people copying the claim. \n \n When it comes to the trial of Jesus, all I have to show is that the claims about the trial violates how trials were by law had to be conducted. You can't expect me to beleive you have 60 or so priests coming in to violate the most important religious holiday of the year to get rid of an annoying gadfly, and also violate the procedures about trials, and for death plenty cases, just to turn some person over to the Romans.\n \n Where are you getting the information about the 'increasing hate of the pharasees to Jesus'.. from the very books that are being apologistic towards the Romans.\n \n I have shown how the trial in the gospels does not match the historical record on what the laws were. I have shown that for the trial to have taken place as decscribed in the gospel would have been sacrialge, and very much against the law, and also violating both the Sabbath, and the high holidays.\n \n Obvious Child has pointed out that both Matthew and Luke had borrowed heavily from Mark, which was written over a decade earlier than either of them. Therefore, your claim about 4 jewish guys writing about the same event is neutralised. \n \n At that point, I don't ahve to show anything more.. .. the Jewish records have no record of \"jesus of nazareth\" at all. Thre supposed references in Jesus in the talmud are just bits and pieces taken out of context, and having Jesus of Nazareth projected onto it... aside from that, the talmud was written well over 100 years later.. hardly a good source.",

   "We have the letter of Philo Judas of ALexandra. We have a lot of history written from that time period. I mean, the 4 gospels had Jesus having this massive following, and doing these miracles all over the place. They mention how amazed how in AWE that Rabbis were with his knowlege. Now, either that is a strong exageration, or it was total fiction. There is a vast silence from any writer about Jesus , aside from the faithful, from before 70 C.E. Now, there were plenty of writers about John the baptist. Philo of Alexandra mentioned the Essenes in his writings. Since Philo died in 50 C.E. , this was near the time that Jesus was supposed to be around. Why didn't he mention Jesus?\n\n \n IMO, Jesus' popularity mostly took place after He was gone. At one point in the gospels He said some things that freaked out the entire crowd that was following Him and most of the them left. (They probably assumed He was just another oddball rabbi at that point.) So it's not like His popularity was consistent. And again, the \"vast silence from any writer about Jesus\" is very possibly because we just dont have hardly any writings from people in the Palestine area who were contemporaries of Christ. Except the accounts from a few of His followers of course, which you dismiss basically because they've been canonized as Christian scripture.\n \n The thing is, there are very early church leaders and \"fathers\" who speak and teach of Christ. There comes a point where logically, it takes a lot more to believe that Christ was a fabrication than a real person. The only alternate view to the idea that Christ was real would be that someone or some group fabricated Christianity as a movement at some point, but why on earth would someone do something like that, especially knowing that some of Christian teaching would bring the ire of Romans and therefore persecution? It's just more logical to assume the Christian movement was started by the person for which it's named. To say otherwise would be like assuming an architect didn't live even thoough the skyscrapper he built, with his name inscribed in stone attributed to him was standing right in front of you. \n \n The building itself is evidence that he lived.",

Its more likely they would almost dismiss Jesus' claim because of the history and the fact it went in the face of the traditions.\n\n you have to remember, the jewish sanhedrin showed absolutely no regard to jesus' version of the \"new covenant\", and anything resembling this would be blasphemy as far as they were concerned. they did not recognize jesus as a manifestation of god, but rather an internal problem that was complicating the already depressing state of captivity. the last thing these guys wanted was to look weak against a blasphemer. blasphemy is the one sin that is referred to as unforgivable even by god himself. therefore, a blasphemer has essential thrown away his life and any chance of redemption, and would be better off dead.\n \n \nI'm no expert in Jewish law in any shape or form, I'm just commenting on other's comments about what seems feasible to me.\n\n so am i. and i've clearly stated why i believe the trial does not conflict with the jewish legal system\n \n Not at all, its very unlikely that as the story/events of Jesus' life were being told that not every precise detail was being covered.

Parables and allegory are suddenly raised to the level of fact. \n \n But we cannot forget that the kingdom of heaven (which Jesus tells us is within us in Luke 17:21) expresses itself in the courage of some great well known people like Anwar al-Sadat and Itzhak Rabin, and Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King: A Muslim, a Jew, a Hindu and a Christian who transcended their time and place.\n \n It also expresses itself everyday in the mothers and fathers who works two jobs to put their children through school, or who go without so their children will have, or the wife who takes in the mother-in-law who was a pain in the XXX for years if the woman becomes seriously ill or too old to live by herself. This is God within shining through, and as Jesus said, don't hide the light of God within you under a basket, follow your heart and let that light shine - not to get a slap on the back and to bask in congratulations, but to help and encourage by your simple actions.",

   "There is a growing publishing business on the evangelical fundamentalist so-called christian right that puts out books that spout outright lies in order to support fundamentalist teachings. Trebor has identified such a lie in a cut and paste from a book referenced by Easyrider. The writer claims that one of the Dead Sea Scrolls (the Damascus Document Scroll) says things it does not say. It is a problem that is often seen in these forums.\n\n \n You and Trebor don't even have a clue who Jesus really is, Howard (Divine Lord God, Jewish Messiah, and physically resurrected Savior). You can't even decipher the Bible, much less go on to other texts.\n \n Deity of Jesus Christ:\n \n \n John 1:23 quotes Isaiah 40:3 as saying John the Baptist was to prepare the way of the LORD (Jehovah). John prepared the way before Jesus so Jesus must be LORD (Jehovah). \n \n \n In Isaiah 44:8 God is the only Rock. Psalm 18:31 says, \"Who is the Rock except our God\"? I Corinthians 10:4, identifies Jesus as the Rock. Jesus must also then be God the Rock. \n \n \n Isaiah 44:24 says that God (Jehovah) is the one who has made all things. Colossians 1:16, speaking of Christ, says that \"all things were created by Him and for him\". Jesus must therefore be Jehovah God. \n \n \n In Jeremiah 10:10 it says \"the LORD (Jehovah) is the true God\". I John 5:20 states that Jesus is the \"true God\". Jesus must be the true God.\n \n \n Isaiah 43:10,11 says that \"I, even I, am the LORD; and there is no savior besides Me. Jesus is the Savior (Matthew 1:21, Titus 2:13; 2 Peter 1:1, etc., etc.). Jesus must be God the Savior.\n \n \n Jehovah knows all things (Psalm 147:5). Jesus knows \"all things.\" (John 16:30). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n \n Jehovah alone is the only one who knows the hearts of all men. (1 Kings 8:39; Jeremiah 17:9-10). Jesus knows the hearts of all men. (John 2:24-25; Rev. 2:18, 23). Jesus must be God.\n \n \n Jehovah is our sanctifier. (Exodus 31:13). Jesus sanctifies us (Hebrews 10:10). Only God is the sanctifier of men. Jesus must be God.\n \n \n Jehovah is our peace (Judges 6:23). Jesus is our peace (Ephesians 2:14). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n \n Jehovah is our righteousness (Jeremiah 23:6). Jesus is our righteousness. (Romans 3:21-22; 1 Corinthians 1:30). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n \n Jehovah is the giver of life who will not allow His people to be delivered / snatched out of His hand (Deuteronomy 32:39). Jesus is the giver of life who will not allow His people to be \"snatched\" out of His hand. (John 10:28). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n \n Jehovah's voice is \"like the roar of rushing waters\" (Ezekiel 43:2). Jesus' \"voice was like the sound of rushing waters\" (Revelation 1:15). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n \n Jehovah is present everywhere.(Proverbs 15:3; Jeremiah 23:24; I Kings 8:27); Jesus is omnipresent (John 1:48; Matthew 18:20; 28:20). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n \n Jehovah's nature does not change (Malachi 3:6). Jesus' nature does not change. (Hebrews 13:8). \n \n \n Jehovah is the only God we are to \"serve\"(2 Kings 17:35); Jesus (identified as the Creator in Colossians 1:16-17) is to be served (Colossians 3:24). Jesus must be Jehovah. \n \n \n Jehovah the Lord is to be set apart as holy (Isaiah 8:12b-13). Jesus, as Lord, is to be set apart as holy (1 Peter 3:14b-15a).\n \n \n Jehovah's glory is not to be given to another (Isaiah 42:8). Jesus shares Jehovah's glory (John 17:5). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n \n God's name is Jehovah (or Yahweh-YHWH - Isaiah 42:8). Jesus has Jehovah's name (John 17:11; John 16:14-15). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n \n Jehovah is the \"mighty God\" (Jeremiah 32:17-18; Isaiah 10:20-21). Jesus is the \"mighty God\" \n (Isaiah 9:6) who is \"Almighty\" (Revelation 1:7-8).\n \n \n Jehovah is \"the first and the last\" (Isaiah 44:6; 48:12). Jesus is the \"first and the last\" (Revelation 1:17-18; 22:12-13, 20). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n \n Jehovah is the \"Alpha and the Omega\" (Revelation 1:8; Revelation 21:6-7). Jesus is the \"Alpha and the Omega\" (Revelation 22:12-13, 20). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n \n Jehovah's title is \"the Holy One\" (Isaiah 47:4). Jesus is \"the Holy One\" (Acts 3:14; John 6:69). Jesus must be Jehovah, the Holy One.\n \n \n Jehovah is the \"stumbling stone\" of Israel (Isaiah 8:13-15). Jesus is the \"stumbling stone\" of Israel (1 Peter 2:6-8). Jesus must be Jehovah.\n \n \n Jehovah is the great Judge who gives life to whom he wishes and who renders to each man \"according\" to his \"deeds\" (Psalm 98:9; Deuteronomy 32:39; Jeremiah 17:9-10). Jesus is the only judge who gives life to whom he wishes and renders to each man \"according\" to his \"deeds\" (John 5:21-22; Revelation 2:18, 23). Jesus must be Jehovah. \n \n \n Jehovah is the great \"shepherd\" who leads his people to \"the spring of the water of life\" (Psalm 23:1-2; Revelation 21:6-7). Jesus as the \"shepherd\" of His people, leads them \"to springs of the water of life\" (John 10:11-18; Revelation 7:17). THERE IS ONLY ONE SHEPHERD --John 10:16.\n \n \n Jehovah is \"Lord of Lords\" (Deuteronomy 10:17). Jesus is \"Lord of Lords.\" (Revelation 17:14; 19:16). The Father is Lord of all (Matthew 11:25; Acts 17:24). Jesus is \"Lord of all.\" (Acts 10:36). THERE IS ONLY ONE LORD (Jude 4) .\n \n \n Jehovah created the universe (Psalm 102:25-27). Jesus created the universe (John 1:3; Colossians 1:15-19; Hebrews 1:10-12). THERE IS ONLY ONE CREATOR. (Isaiah 44:24).

You refer to all these Biblical passages and almost no words of Jesus. Again, a good Biblican view, but not a Christian one.\n\n \n Nonsense. Open your eyes this time, Howard:\n \n Did Jesus Claim To Be God? \n \n Among the religious leaders who have attained a large following throughout history, Jesus Christ is unique in the fact that He alone claimed to be God in human flesh. A common misconception is that some or many of the leaders of the world's religions made similar claims, but this is simply not the case.\n \n Buddha did not claim to be God; Moses never said that he was Yahweh; Mohammed did not identify himself to be Ahura Mazda. Yet Jesus, the carpenter from Nazareth, said that he who has seen him (Jesus) has seen the Father (John 14:9).\n \n The claims of Christ are many and varied. He said that He existed before Abraham (John 8:58), and that He was equal with the Father (John 14:9). The New Testament equated Jesus as the creator of the universe (John 1:3), and that He is the one who holds everything together (Colossians 1:17). The apostle Paul says that God was manifest in the flesh (1 Timothy 3:16, KJV), and John the evangelist says that \"the Word was God\" (John 1:1). The united testimony of Jesus and the writers of the New Testament is that He was more than mere man; He was God.\n \n Not only did His friends notice that He claimed to be God, but so did His enemies as well. There may be some doubt today among the skeptics who refuse to examine the evidence, but there was no doubt on the part of the Jewish authorities. When Jesus asked them why they wanted to stone Him, they replied, \"For a good work we do not stone You, but for blasphemy; and because You, being a man, make Yourself out to be God\" (John 10:33, NASB).\n \n This fact separates Jesus from the other religious figures. In the major religions of the world, the teachings -- not the teacher -- are all-important. \n Confucianism is a set of teachings; Confucius is not important. Islam is the revelation of Allah, with Mohammed being the prophet, and Buddhism emphasizes the principles of the Buddha and not Buddha himself. This is especially true of Hinduism, where there is no historic founder. \n However, at the center of Christianity is the person of Jesus Christ. Jesus did not just claim to be teaching mankind the truth; He claimed that He was the truth (John 14:6).\n \n What Jesus taught is not the important aspect of Christianity, but what is important is who Jesus was. Was He the Son of God? Is He the only way a person can reach God? This was the claim He made for Himself. \n Suppose this very night the President of the United States appeared on all the major networks and proclaimed that \"I am God Almighty. I have the power to forgive sin. I have the authority to raise my life back from the dead.\" \n \n He would be quickly and quietly shut off the air, led away, and replaced by the Vice-President. Anybody who would dare make such claims would have to be either out of his mind or a liar, unless he was God. \n \n This is exactly the case with Jesus. He clearly claimed all these things and more. If He is God, as He claimed, we must believe in Him, and if He is not, then we should have nothing to do with Him. Jesus is either Lord of all or not Lord at all. \n \n Yes, Jesus claimed to be God. Why should anyone believe it? After all, merely claiming to be something does not make it true. Where's the evidence that Jesus is God?\n \n The Bible gives various reasons, including miracles and fulfilled prophecy, that are intended to convince us that Jesus is the one whom He said He was (John 20:30, 31). The main reason, or the sign which Jesus Himself said would demonstrate that He was the Son of God, was His resurrection from the dead.\n \n When asked for a sign from the religious leaders, Jesus replied, \"For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, so will the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth\" (Matthew 12:40, RSV). \n \n In another place He said, when asked for a sign, \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up . . . but he spake of the temple of his body\" (John 2:19, 21, KJV). The ability to raise His life back from the dead was the sign that separates Him not only from all other religious leaders, but also from anyone else who has ever lived. \n \n Anyone wishing to refute the case for Christianity must explain away the story of the resurrection. Therefore, according to the Bible, Jesus proves to be the Son of God by coming back from the dead (Romans 1:4). The evidence is overwhelming that Jesus did rise from the grave, and it is this fact that proves Jesus to be God.\n \n (This is an excerpt from the book, \"Answers to Tough Questions,\" by Josh McDowell and Don Stewart.)",

Forget for a moment Church doctrine; just read it...\n \n Joh 20:17 Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.\n \n ...wherein Jesus makes a clear distinction between himself and God.

In other words, the risen Jesus makes a clear and unmistakable distinction between himself and God. This, according to the Gospel of John, written circa 100 CE, with the assumption that the author of this text had access to earlier writings. \n \n But since you raise the subject of the risen Jesus, I have a few questions for you...\n [*]Did Jesus raise himself from the dead, or was it an act of the Father? If it was an act of the Father, where is the claim to Jesus' divinity?[*]Assuming a bodily resurrection (empty tomb), are there not NT verses which suggest that the risen Jesus passed through walls, while at the same time he ate meals? [*]Certain NT verses allege that the risen Jesus ascended bodily toward heaven. Can we assume from this that 1) heaven exists somewhere in the sky above the earth, and 2) that heaven occupies some physical place? Remember, Paul tells us that Jesus will soon come down from the sky to transport the bodies of both the living and the dead, through the clouds, up to heaven.",

   "Well, I know that some people writing decades after the alledged incident made that claim. I wouldn't say that some writers claim decades after the alledged incident 'sure proof of divinity' by any means. After all, there are other stories of people being raised from the dead too.. even in the bible. (larzares for one).\n \n Unless you are going to say Lazarus is divine too.\n\n Trebor,\n Yes, the incident of the resurrection is taken to be alleged by those who don't believe. I am not attempting to debate all the hotly contested aspects of the resurrection. You are missing my point. Let me try this one more time.\n \n I am wondering why Orion takes this quote of scripture of a person writing decades after the alleged incident concerning Jesus ascending to \"his God\" as a reliable, valid statement of the author. If he accepts this as a reliable, valid statement of the author and it occurs in the Resurrection narrative then he must also take the statement by that same author on the Resurrection as valid. If he doesn't believe the author had the integrity to be truthful on one statement then why would he be truthful on the other? So if you take this statement as valid, then I must ask you to also profess your belief in the Resurrection. Are you ready to do that? I must also ask Orion to do the same.\n \n Now, in the above statements there is also a mandate for any believer. It must be turned around on us. If we take the statement that Jesus was resurrected as valid then we must also take that same author's statement that Jesus ascended to \"his God\" as valid. I have no problem doing this as part of the conundrum of the Trinity. It acknowledges the separate personhood of the three persons of the Trinity. But a Christian mystery is not something that we can know nothing about. It is something about which things were revealed to us, some things about which our learning has developed from this revelation, but some things about which there are still aspects that we do not know. The other possibility is that it is some type of figure of speech as Jesus utilized different manners of conveying things in different ways.\n \n It is interesting that you bring up Lazarus though. He was not God. But Jesus raised him. If you read the story of Lazarus in John 11 then you find many indications of Jesus' Godhood. Jesus makes very clear distinctions between the resurrection of Lazarus and his own resurrection. \n \n John 11:4 \"This illness is not unto death; it is for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified by means of it.\" It is for the glory of God so that the Son of God may be glorifed. Why is a man being glorified like a God? Cross reference with John 11:13,14 to be sure that Jesus meant Lazarus had truly died and he was not there so the disciples would believe that it was truly a miracle and not some kind of deceit.\n \n John 11:25 \"I am the resurrection and the life, he who believes in me shall never die.\"\n \n Context tells us that Jesus' resurrection was different and superior to Lazarus' resurrection. It was simply divine.\n \n Do you know any mere men who have raised others from the dead or who they themselves have been raised? I would like to meet them.",

   "Orion,\n \nOK, let me try this one more time. Please read again the following verse and pay attention to the message it attempts to convey. Forget for a moment Church doctrine; just read it...\n \n Joh 20:17 Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.\n \n ...wherein Jesus makes a clear distinction between himself and God. And lest you argue that this comes to us from the human side of Jesus, I remind you of your own assertion that this comes to us from the risen Jesus. In other words, the risen Jesus makes a clear and unmistakable distinction between himself and God. This, according to the Gospel of John, written circa 100 CE, with the assumption that the author of this text had access to earlier writings. \n\n Please see my previous post to Trebor. \n \nBut since you raise the subject of the risen Jesus, I have a few questions for you...\n [*]Did Jesus raise himself from the dead, or was it an act of the Father? If it was an act of the Father, where is the claim to Jesus' divinity?[*]Assuming a bodily resurrection (empty tomb), are there not NT verses which suggest that the risen Jesus passed through walls, while at the same time he ate meals? [*]Certain NT verses allege that the risen Jesus ascended bodily toward heaven. Can we assume from this that 1) heaven exists somewhere in the sky above the earth, and 2) that heaven occupies some physical place? Remember, Paul tells us that Jesus will soon come down from the sky to transport the bodies of both the living and the dead, through the clouds, up to heaven.\n\n [*]I'm not sure. Either Jesus or the Father did it, or they worked in concert. What's your opinion? Jesus did say, \"Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days.\" (John 2:19) [*]Jesus did, in fact, eat meals and possibly passed through walls. He is not bound by time or space as he was not bound by death. He can bind himself to the confines of time and space but he is not bound by them.[*]Why couldn't heaven exist somewhere up in the sky?",

I would calim that there is a stark difference between the two in regards of social acceptance. Purchasing films, pictures or books portraying acts are not the same as purchasing the ability to perform and indulge in the same acts.\n \n And I also want to stress that I`m merely talking about prostitution. Why pornography is not consumed in the same proportion by women and men could be linked to ideas of dominance and subordination, but in these cases, I also think it is an issue of supply and differences in preferences (heterosexual women tend to enjoy watching men rather than other women for example).\n \n \nas far as racist or financial oppression, often the reality doesnt fit the theory. there are lots of well-off men and women that get into selling sex for various reasons: curiousity, thrill, revenge, etc. and there are many oppressed individuals who refuse to partake in prostitution because of personal beliefs, as well as those who simply live a promiscous lifestyle and take gifts or money\n\n \n As far as I know, the \"happy whore\" is largely a myth. Sure there are a few individuals that might engage in sex-selling activities for other reasons than desperate for money, but they make up such a minority that they are largely irrelevant for discussions about the sex-selling business. \n \n But either way, this does not really relate to what I said about racism, inequality and prosititution. It is not about the sellers. But about the buyers. What they feel comfortable about buying. \n \n Another example is the lucrative sex-business originating from former Soviet republics. While this business certainly is growing because of a steady and cheap supply of economicly desperate women, one should certainly not discount the effects of west-european males rationalising their behaviour based on racism towards slavic people in general, and slavic women in particular....\n \n \n Edit: seem to have accidently deleted parts of my post...\n \n \n \nin a sense this is true, but i think for other reasons. in general, women enjoy sex with a steady and reliable lover much more than with numerous casual partners. men on the other hand enjoy multiple sex partners more commonly. its a psychological thing.\n\n \n Actually I don`t believe this at all. If nothing else, mathematics would imply that this type of thing could never be proven in a quantitave manner ;)\n \n And besides, sex is not so much about biological or physical cravings as it is about social and psychological rewards. And these are not dependant on biological factors, but rather social values, norms and expectations. (This answer got a bit shortened since I deleted the original paragraph. I might have to revisit this issue later :) )",

   "I don`t consider pornography and prostitution to be the same thing. I would calim that there is a stark difference between the two in regards of social acceptance. Purchasing films, pictures or books portraying acts are not the same as purchasing the ability to perform and indulge in the same acts.\n\n but the porn star is a prostitute. she gets paid for having sex with whoever the director tells her to. the main difference is residual income. \n \n \nAs far as I know, the \"happy whore\" is largely a myth. Sure there are a few individuals that might engage in sex-selling activities for other reasons than desperate for money, but they make up such a minority that they are largely irrelevant for discussions about the sex-selling business. \n \n But either way, this does not really relate to what I said about racism, inequality and prosititution. It is not about the sellers. But about the buyers. What they feel comfortable about buying. \n\n i didnt say anything about them being happy. my point is that economic status often has no relation to sexual lifestyle. i agree that most women would gladly do anything other than sell their bodies, and that the \"happy whore\" is in the minority, but in response to simone's view that economic and social class is the reason for prostitution, i still disagree. in fact, how would that explain the \"whore-houses\" that are operated by women? \n \n \nAnother example is the lucrative sex-business originating from former Soviet republics. While this business certainly is growing because of a steady and cheap supply of economicly desperate women, one should certainly not discount the effects of west-european males rationalising their behaviour based on racism towards slavic people in general, and slavic women in particular....\n\n in any economic relation, the buyer has the money, and the seller has what the buyer wants. if the europeans have the money that the slavs want, and the slavs have the product that the buyers want, they trade. i do see your point about the dominant air of the europeans over the russians because of their economic turmoil. but in any situation where a seller is desperate for the buyer's money, you could find an element of oppression. prostitution cannot be singled out. immigrant labor of any type, particular what we consider menial jobs, exist for the same reason. but that doesnt mean that racism is the cause. how would you explain american housewives hiring mexican men to mow thier lawns? (this is getting far off topic i think...)\n \n \nActually I don`t believe this at all. If nothing else, mathematics would imply that this type of thing could never be proven in a quantitave manner ;)\n\n are you saying that statistically women are polygamous more often than men? the math backs up what i just said. women prefer a single steady partner, men usually prefer loose casual affairs.\n \n \nAnd besides, sex is not so much about biological or physical cravings as it is about social and psychological rewards. And these are not dependant on biological factors, but rather social values, norms and expectations. (This answer got a bit shortened since I deleted the original paragraph. I might have to revisit this issue later :) )\n\n yes, thats what i said (in not so many words)",

   "but the porn star is a prostitute. she gets paid for having sex with whoever the director tells her to. the main difference is residual income. \n \n\n \n I agree that there is no real difference for the porn star (apart from safety issues and the like). But I would still argue that there is a real difference between the consumer of porn and the consumer of prostitution. \n \n \n i didnt say anything about them being happy. my point is that economic status often has no relation to sexual lifestyle. i agree that most women would gladly do anything other than sell their bodies, and that the \"happy whore\" is in the minority, but in response to simone's view that economic and social class is the reason for prostitution, i still disagree. in fact, how would that explain the \"whore-houses\" that are operated by women? \n\n \n You mean women that also participate in \"the action\" (to put it bluntly) as well as managing a succesful enterprise? I don`t know to be honest. But I don`t think they are that many (at least not compared to the business at large). \n \n \nin any economic relation, the buyer has the money, and the seller has what the buyer wants. if the europeans have the money that the slavs want, and the slavs have the product that the buyers want, they trade. i do see your point about the dominant air of the europeans over the russians because of their economic turmoil. but in any situation where a seller is desperate for the buyer's money, you could find an element of oppression. prostitution cannot be singled out. immigrant labor of any type, particular what we consider menial jobs, exist for the same reason. but that doesnt mean that racism is the cause. how would you explain american housewives hiring mexican men to mow thier lawns? (this is getting far off topic i think...)\n \n\n \n Far off-topic, perhaps. But still very interesting. I think there is an important difference between hiring low-cost labour for mowing lawns and low-cost labour for engaging in sex-trades. A lawn mowing worker is hired only based on costs (and ability to mow the lawn), while I would argue that the latvian (or what have you) prositute is also hired because of her supposed subordination. I have no evidence to back this up with though (hence my usage of \"I would argue\" and \"I believe\" :) )\n \n And to answer your question, no. I don`t think the mexican is hired to mow the lawns because of racism. He might be hired for having a fight with a dog because of racism though as this would another example where we would need to stretch our morals and ignore the fact that the mexican is human just as the rest of us.\n \n \nare you saying that statistically women are polygamous more often than men? the math backs up what i just said. women prefer a single steady partner, men usually prefer loose casual affairs.\n\n \n How can this be show? I mean, in order for a man to have a loose causal affair, you need a woman who has the same, no?\n \n \nyes, thats what i said (in not so many words)\n\n \n Ah. :)\n \n \nThank you, Eddy.\n \n And, by the way, I must also add that perhaps if men were better lovers they wouldn't have to buy sex.\n\n \n Hehe..

Neither are Swedish men. They are just looking for a bit of fun and experience. But as age takes it`s toll and the biological clock starts ticking, Swedes are starting to considering steady permanent relationships. I don`t have a single friend that is married (ages 20-30). I have a few friends that are in a steady relationship, but I don`t think they consider them as permanent. Children often change all of this though (even though marriage is still pretty uncommon for younger parents). Is this really different from The States?",

After doing that did you research, in depth, any New Testament passages you thought were invalid? \n \n Personally I don't think you've done your research.\n\n Admiteddly I've never read the whole thing, I don't think I've ever actually heard of definitive proof of the more important claims - that Jesus was God, God actually exists, the resurection actually happened etc. I've been told many time on these forums and elsewhere that this is a matter of faith and that in itself is important.\n \n But setting that aside, even if we assume that it is true and that everything in it happened. The Bible is not told from a neutral third party perspective, some of the events and the language used to describe them will be tainted by their own involvement. The 'venom' directed at followers then and now is a good example - yes you may occasionally get called a facist bigot or Christonazi, however most of the time its more a 'I don't beleive what you do so don't make your beliefs law' or a critism of debating style rather than just insults.

   "Prove Jesus was not gay and prove that it makes any difference.\n\n I think Jesus gives us the answer to whether he was gay in Matthew 19. He conveys to us the way marriage was meant to be. He conveys to us that God created us male and female for a reason. He mentions that man leaves parents to be joined to his wife. There is no mention of man leaving his parents to join to a husband. This idea was not even in the realm of contemplation. He lets us know why he was celibate--for the Kingdom. Sex is a foretaste of our union with God. It is a taste of the divine life, a glimpse of heaven. Because Jesus was God, he was obviously already united with God and he already lived the divine life and knew of heaven.\n \n Matthew 19: 3-12 \"And Pharisees came up to him and tested him by asking, 'Is it lawful to divorce one's wife for any cause?' He answered, 'Have you not read that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, 'For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one'? So they are no longer two but one. What therefore God has joined together, let no man put asunder.' They said to him, 'Why then did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce, and to put her away?' 'He said to them, 'For your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so. And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife, except for unchastity, and marries another, commits adultery; and he who marries a divorced woman, commits adultery.\"\n \n \"The disciples said to him, 'If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is not expedient to marry.' But he said to them, 'Not all men can recive this precept, but only those to whom it is given. For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to receive this, let him receive it.'\" (I originally posted this way back on page 18, Post #86)",

The Bible refers to love in this case as that between BROTHERS And Paul's ministry? God called him to be single. Nice try, but the target is 8' to the right.\n\n Actually, if you count the Kinsey 4,5, and 6's you get 18%. It's 10% for the 5s and 6s. That'd be the people that prefer the same sex over opposite for the most part. 2,3,and 4 would be those who are bi and lean slightly one way or the other. 0 and 1 are people who pretty much always choose opposite sex over same. 0 and 6 are very rare though. Anyway, 10% of people are a 5 or 6. About 3% are a full 6.\n \n \n Could Jesus have been asexual? In certain philosophies asexuality is considered a sign of enlightenment.
