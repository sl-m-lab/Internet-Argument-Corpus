A society might share their common moral ideas, and decide to make some into law, but that's a consequence, not what determines the morals in the first place.\n \n Just to save time, it's theoretically possible for a law to be passed that makes anything a \"crime\". Does that mean that society determines what is moral, and that you cannot have your own idea of right and wrong? If that's obscure, you can see some ridiculous examples:\n \n http://littlerock.about.com/cs/factsfun/a/strangelaws.htm\n \n\n My favorite law is one designed to get Northerners into trouble. That's right folks, if you mispronounce Arkansas (Ar-kan-saw) you're in for a fine or jail time. Just be sure not to flirt with those Northerners as you tell them they are breaking the law. In Little Rock, flirtation between men and women on the streets may result in a 30-day jail term. You might get to share a cozy cell together. Be careful. Don't get extremely cozy in that cell. Oral sex is considered sodomy in Arkansas and is punishable. \n \n Animals in Arkansas get the weirdest laws. If you live in Arkansas, you may not keep an alligator in your bathtub. I guess lawmakers saw the move Alligator once too often. Dog owners in Little Rock beware! If your dog barks after 6 PM you can be fined. The dog can be impounded. Cow owners should take heed too. Bessie may need her exercise but even cows deserve Sunday's off. It's unlawful to walk your cow after 1:00 on Sundays. \n \n Women are also a popular subject for laws. Some old Arkansas laws are archaic. There is a law that states female teachers who bob their hair cannot be given a raise. Even more degrading is an old law that states a man can beat his wife in Little Rock provided he does it with a stick no bigger than 3 inches across and not more than once a month. \n \n \n These, to me, are not immoral acts if violated.\n \n -Mach",

Since it is the primary thing that is contrary to man's moral goal (reason/achievement according to what I've read of Rand), it's then the primary moral crime (since it's contrary to it). \n\n Man's goal is to return to God. Why do you think it's a 'moral' goal to achieve reason?\n This would seem to be to suggest you 'question' it by supporting it. Hence...\n \nSeems reasonable, if that's how you define morals, \n\n And as you've stated you believe reason is the only means of telling truth from non-reality, and science = all knowledge.\n \nbut how do YOU define morals?\n\n I don't define morals. God does.\n \nOur recent US election was said to be heavily based on \"values and morals\". I don't even know what that means. What are your morals based on? Do they ultimately come from you, or do you adopt a group's morals without resistance? \n -Mach\n\n What is adopting morals without resistance for you? For a non-Objectivist you seem to term your phrases like they do. Have you adopted her moral stance without resistance?",

No definition necessarily means the same to everyone, unless it's agreed upon. That's why we have to have dictionaries, no one knows definitions unless we write it down and agree or not.\n \n Truth found in contradictions? I don't follow. To Rand, truth is knowledge about reality. Contradictions are the opposite of reality, and therefore not true. A or not A. If it's A, and someone says it's not A, this does not lead to truth. It's the opposite of truth..i.e. a lie, a moral crime (above).\n \n Humans who thought flight impossible, were correct at the time, they indeed were not flying, and they couldn't see the future. Those who thought humans flying was in principle, impossible, were wrong (in error).\n \n Irrational:\n Not rational.\n \n Rational in describing thought:\n Supported by reason and logic.\n Reason: Beliefs/knowledge based on observation/demonstration, subject to falsification, etc.\n \n Ayn Rand: I don't know much about the person. I've read she was a romantic, though I'm fairly certain her philosophical work was intended to be derived entirely from logical principles. (Which in a sense is strict/literalist).\n \n -Mach",
