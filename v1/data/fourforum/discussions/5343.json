   "Since I'm in a good mood today, I've decided to help \"Angelsweety89 \" out by fixing her post for her, thus allowing me to reply to it.\n \n \n1. We have a fossil record showing how life evolved\nThat was made. By evolutionists who wereing bassing there work on a theory.\nThe theory of evolution grew in part out of the discovery of fossils. The fossil record wasn't \"made\" by \"evolutionists\", evolution as an idea grew out of people looking at the fossil record. The fossil record is one of the key things that provides the means to falsify evolution theory. SImply find a single genuine example of say a cow, goat, chimp, pig, horse or human fossil in the same rock strata as a cretacious dinosaur for example and evolutionary theory would take a large knock. Find a bunch of them in devonian rocks for example and it would come tumbling down, utterly falsified. \n \n \n2. We have a growing understanding of DNA showing how life evolved\nOf DNA...understanding! HMM yet again does that make sense?\nWell your reply makes no sense, but my statement did. One of the best examples of DNA evidence for evolution is found in our very own chromosome 2. Our close relatives, the other apes, do not have a chromosome 2: they have two chromosomes (2p and 2q) that when joined together form a very similar base sequence to our chromosome 2 (including telomeres right in the middle of chromosome 2 in humans just where we would expect it to be if it were formed from a fusion of two separate chromosomes).\n \n \n3. We have witnessed speciation events\nHave you witnessed a animal going into another animal? If so please share with us as to were.\nNot personally, no. Experiments by others though, both in the lab and in the field, have reported instances of new species forming of Rhagoletis sp, Drosophila sp, Eurosta sp and Tribolium sp to name just a few.\n \n \n4. Oh sorry, you only asked for one, didn't you. I got all carried away...\nYou just labeled telling me you got carried away as proof of evolution, are you aware that telling me you went to far isn't evolution? Or are you stupid in that department of teh brain also?\nYes I am aware that it isn't evidence. In your haste to criticise, you missed the implication of what I said: there is a vast store of evidence in support of evolution. I've merely touched the surface. Allow me to offer a few more:\n \n 4. the eye of cephalopods is a far better \"design\" than that of vertebrates. Evolution only allows for characteristics to be inherited from ancestors, not adopted from unrelated concurrent species. This is what is observed with the vertibrate eye.\n \n 5. The avian lung is a far better \"design\" than that of mammals. Again evolution only allows for characteristics to be inherited from ancestors, not adopted from unrelated concurrent species. This is what is observed with the avian lung.\n \n 6. The discovery of Archaeopteryx offered evidence that birds evolved from dinosaurs. The implication of this is that some dinosaurs probably had feathers. We have recently uncovered numerous examples of featured dinosaur fossils in China.\n \n Want more?\n \n \nI have just told you tons of things as to why you're theory is still a theory.\nSorry? Where have you told me these \"tons of things\"? You have offered no evidence at all in support of your position: just a puerile \"I aksed first\" reply.\n \n \nAnd I can assure you you haven't \"studied\" evolution: you have read/listened to or watched a bunch of liars telling you mistruths and falsehoods about evolution.\nExcuse me but I have studied this topic for many years and I can assure you that I know what I am talking about.\nExcellent. Can you therefore pelase explain to me the relationship between Hamilton's rule of kin selection and the coefficient of relatedness?\n \n \nYou have been blinded and need to wake up and realize that.\nWhat a curious mixture of metaphors.\n \n \nYes, I've heard of Mr Horvind. He is a liar, con-artist, fraud and criminal. If you have \"studied\" evolution via his ramblings, then you have been duped, big time!\nI'm sure that I ain't the one who has been duped into believing anything.\nHmm, perhaps you would care to read http://www.blessedquietness.com/journal/housechu/hovind.htm for example. That's the problem with being duped: one is generally unaware of it. If you were aware, then you wouldn't have been duped.\n \n \nNo, it couldn't. I have more evidence to support evolution than you have had hot dinners (unless you are thousands of years old of course and have eaten dozens of hot dinners every day of your life).\nI am not thousands of years old. And the earth is not billions of years old. That so called \"evidence\" called Carbon Dating don't work and I'll tell what evolutionist say Carbon Dating is and How it don't work.\n\"Carbon Dating\" can only date items up to 60,000(ish) years old. \"Carbon Dating\" cannot be used to test whether the earth is billions of years old or not. Carbon dating works brilliantly when used correctly. It has even been used to date artifacts related to events described in the Bible (creationists oddly enough seem quite happy with carbon dating just so long as it gives a figure of less than 6,000 years). \n \n \nYou will learn that some of us make \"smart-arsed\" remarks because we are smart. Read my other posts here: I have supported my position many times. I am more than justified in ridiculing you before you even start for we have been here and done this same routine over and over again with each silly little creationist that comes wandering through here.\nIs it silly creationists or Blind and stupid evolutionists.\n I am sure that it is the second one!\nThat is because you are a \"silly creationist\" emoticon_xclown",

   "Creation vs. Evolution\n A Debate.\n The creation stories recorded in world religions are not science. Evolution is science. Evolution is the natural explanation for a nature world. Evolution is the process by which the characteristics of a species change over time (Discover Biology p.11). Science seeks to explain the natural world and its explanations are tested using evidence from the natural world. (Evolution Berkeley). Data is gathered to learn about the natural world. \n In a \"nutshell\" the process of science is, ideas are developed through reasoning, claims are based on testing explanations against observations of the natural world and rejecting the ones that fail the test, and finally claims are subjected to peer review and replication (Evolution Berkeley). The simplest explanation has the advantage, this principle is called parsimony i.e. \n 1. The snails, nautiloids, squids, octopi and cuttlefish have the basic body parts.\n 2. The shell of a nautilus and its extinct relatives, the ammonites, is very similar to the shell of a snail.\n 3. The tentacles of an octopus, when carefully examined, can be seen to be a modified snail's foot.\n 4. The stomachs of all members of this group have the same arrangement of parts. \n One possible explanation is that these animals have independently acquired equivalent organs through a remarkable series of coincidences, but the most likely explanation is that these animals inherited similar organs through common ancestry. That is parsimony. (Evolution Berkeley). \n The conclusions of science are reliable, though tentative. Science is always a work in progress, and its conclusions are always tentative. Scientific conclusions are not tentative in the sense that they are temporary until the real answer comes along. Conclusions are well founded in their factual content and thinking and are merely tentative only in the sense that all ideas are open to scrutiny. (Method p.11). Tentativeness means that scientist are willing to modify their ideas as new evidence appears. \n The central ideas of evolution are that life has a history- it has changed over time and that different species share common ancestors.\n \n (Evolution Berkeley)\n The Evidence\n 1. Fossil Records for transitional forms, and clues at the cellular level. http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/lines/Ifossil_ev.shtml\n 2. Homologies http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/lines/IIhomologies.shtml\n 3. Chronology and geography http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/lines/IIIdistribution.shtml\n 4. Artificial Selection, Ecology, experiments and nested hierarchies. http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/lines/IVby_examp.shtml ( Dawkins p. 169-194).\n Evolution is the scientific explanation for the origin of species. Science is based on reliable principals. The means of science is empirical in nature and are verified by experiments. Scientific claims are reviewed by peers and replicated. \n Science addresses a different subject matter than religion. The mode of thinking in religion is faith, but science is empirical. \n \n \n Reference:\n http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/evohome.html\n Descartes, Rene, \"Discourse on Method\", Hackett Publishing Company 1998\n Dawkinds, Richard, \"The Blind Watchmaker\", 1996 W.W.

As the brain develops the situations it can imagine as possibilities become more complicated and the vague dark area by the lake where you need to be cautious merges with visions often brought on by hallucinogenic foods.\n Eventually previous mysticism and superstition begins feeding itself so people are imagining more complex and abstract things in the dark area by the lake.",

Or, in some very simple tests on single celled algae where the selection process is purely you drain some of their liquid habitat off every now and then after a few generations most of the algae will be of a type that clumps together rather than floaating freely.\n \n Then on top of that, the Man'o'war jellyfish is not one creature, but a colony of several different types of organism. The jump from a co-operating colony to a multicellular organism is not that hard to imagine.\n \n Oxygen respiration is higly conserved (the enzymes are very similar to each other across a massive evolutionary distance) and likely arose first in creatures like phosphoresant bacteria found in the sea. The enzymes used here are purely for getting rid of oxygen which would otherwise poison the organism. Its electron transport chain in its oxygen removal system is very, very similar to our version (though we have a bit tagged on the end to make use of the byproducts).",

At the very basic caveman level, and at the most advanced scientific level God is the system of the universe. It may be sentient in a way similar to something we can vaguely consider but without knowing how it works there is no way we can know how it thinks. Internal consistancy is the main problem most organised religion has - unless you can claim to understand a being that doesn't even exist in, let alone use the same physical laws as you do then anything that is supposedly said by it is meaningless.\n \n You have no way of telling whether its complete lies to be followed; designed for some greater purpose later on, abosolute truth that needs to be followed or intended for people to pick holes in so they turn instead to what they are supposed to do. If God is not human, then the teachings of religion are irrelevant and open to complete personal interpretation or to be ignored without any threat of divine punishment as in this case you are just as likely to be damned to eternal punishment for following the rules as not. Its only the actions of other individuals that contain your actions.\n \n Alteratively, God is subject to human understanding in which case there is a huge problem that some information will be forever beyond your knowledge and therefore Gods, not to mention that the actions of God in the bible are subject to individual interpretation as much as any other human viewpoint.\n All that changes is that some lying entity is more powerful than you, which again means that you are just as likely to arbitary punishment as if the entity was a God beyond human understanding. Infact in this case, if the afterlife is not purely random or non-existant yet still governed my an entity with motives understandable by humans then God requires worship.\n \n In this case then it is best to ultilies this need that they have of you and your fellow men to ensure that this is an equal exchange rather than to enslave yourself to a complete unknown that is just as likely to punish you for obeying the rules (or despite obeying the rules).

   "its our human nature to go against everything God has for us.\n\n \n The relatively new field of neurotheology suggests that it's in our nature to believe in God. A brief overview of some of the ideas.\n \n First, research is showing that belief in God may be neurologically prewired into humans. During spiritual moments - feelings of oneness with the Universe - our brains show distinctive patterns of activity/nonactivity. In fact, one of the regions affected is just the part of the brain that helps maintain the self/nonself boundary: when this part of the brain is cut off from receiving input, one's boundary stops being sharply defined - it dissolves, so to speak - and s/he feels a spiritual oneness with everything. Also, temporal lobe epilepsy can produce out of body AND religious experiences (one woman who had just given birth, and had temporal lobe epilepsy, told her husband how wonderful it was to have given birth to Christ). So when one experiences spiritual/religious moments, they are tied to physiological activity in the brain: and, activation of the brain has been shown capable of causing such experiences.\n \n Second, consider belief in God to already have arisen in some ancient population of humans. Would natural selection tend to preserve this mode of thought or eliminate it? Retain it. The feeling of optimism that is associated with belief in a higher power and an afterlife is beneficial. Religion has several positive psychological affects. But that doesn't make it true.\n \n A couple of books on these matters are:\n \n \"Why God Won't Go Away: Brain Science and the Biology of Belief\", Andre Newberg, Eugene D'Aquili, & Vince Rause, Ballantine Books, 2001\n \n \"The God Gene: How Faith is Hardwired into OUr Genes\", Dean Hamer, Doubleday, 2004\n \n \nBushAllTheWay: too many people are so full of themselves that they dont even realize it until one day an 18 wheeler totals their 1985 porsche! God has to kick you in the butt one day and the more you walk away from him the harder he will hit to make you realize whats true.\n\n \n If you mean that many people come to believe in God only after when they hit rock bottom financially or emotionally, or are in some other way in a sorry state, such as on death's bed or in the emergency room or cancer ward, then I agree. Now WHY might that be a time many people are converted? Psychological reasons! The optimism associated with belief in a higher power and an afterlife allows one to have hope and push on.\n \n \n \n PS: I just saw something typical on TV that made me chuckle. I was watching one of the amazing video shows and a man in the navy, while on an aircraft carrier, was walking by a jet about to launch. He got sucked into the engine ... OUCH! His whole body was taken in and he was messed up pretty good, but didn't die because his helmet got lodged in the blades and temporarily stopped the blades and another crew member immediately signalled for the pilot to shut down the jet. So this guy, when interviewed, says that God must have been looking out for him. WHAT? So God let this guy get sucked into a jet engine ... that's looking out for a person? Tell you what, God, please don't do me any favors!!!!",

   "Please, take a step back and lay out in point form your position on Creation and Evolution. If you will, please provide evidence that supports your position as welll.\n\n \n It wasn't addressed to me, but...\n \n Before delving into a lengthy and somewhat technical discussion, let me address a common YEC misrepresentation, which is to assert that evolution should be rejected (for example, not taught in public schools) because \"evolution is only a theory\". This Creationist catch phrase is disingenuous.\n \n \n\"We emphasize that the meaning of the word \"theory\", when used by scientists, is not \"speculation\" as it is in ordinary English usage. Failure to make this distinction has been prominent in creationist challenges to evolution. The creationists have spoken of evolution as \"only a theory\", as if it were little better than a guess. In fact, the theory of evolution is supported by such massive evidence that most biologists view repudiation of evolution as tantamount to repudiation of reason.\" (Cleveland P. Hickman Jr., Larry S. Roberts, & Allan Larson, WCB McGraw-Hill, 1997, Integrated Principles of Zoology: 10th Edition, p13) \n\n \n To help focus what otherwise could be a quite wide-ranging extensive discussion, let's see how the two opposing views fair as explanations for just one key biological event...the origin of humans. The scientific explanation for the origin of humans is, of course, evolution; while the YEC position is special creation (divine intervention in the creation of our species) \n \n Scientific origin of humans\n What does science have that verifies its position that humans are the result of evolution? Fully supported and demonstrated underlying principles, for one! The following is the \"in a nutshell\" version. \n \n Science has shown that DNA stores genetic information, in its base sequences. Science has shown that it is the genotype (genetic makeup) of an organism that determines its phenotype (outward appearance or biochemical properties). Science has shown that changes made to DNA base sequences result in altered phenotypes. Science has shown that mutations - changes in the DNA base sequences (that can be inherited) - occur spontaneously, changing the information stored and therefore the phenotype. Thus, there is a fully supported scientific explanation for why organisms are as they are (why they have the morphology and biochemical properties they do) as well as how their morphology/biochemical properties can change over time ... completely naturally. \n \n Logic and experimentation have shown the next key factor: natural selection. Individuals in a population, though very similar to one another, differ. Because of individual differences in the members of a population, some will be more fit than others: in the particular environment the population finds itself in, some individuals will have a better chance of surviving and/or reproducing, thus having a better chance of passing on their own genes to the next generation. This differential passing on of genes into future generations (with \"fitter\" genes being more likely to be passed on that less \"fit\" ones) leads to changes in the genetic makeup of generations over time: more technically, the population's allelic frequencies change, and therefore, by definition, evolution - microevolution, to be more precise - has occurred. And as one might expect, as the genetic makeup of a population changes, so too do the morphology and/or biochemical properties of its members. Thus, there is a fully supported scientific explanation for how populations evolve. \n \n In addition to all of the sound reasoning that indicates speciation would occur in the wild, science also has documented cases of such: both for plants (for example, by means of allopolyploidy) and for animals (for example, by allopatric speciation). Also, note that according to most biologists, speciation is a macroevolutionary event: thus, Creationists cannot legitimately claim that only microevolution is well supported by scientific observations. So we see that science has a fully supported theoretical model for speciation, which has been confirmed by observations and lab experiments.\n \n We see, then, that evolution itself stands on firm, well supported, scientific ground.\n \n The rest is often times said to be nothing more than extrapolation...because microevolution and speciation have been observed in the short amount of time that biologists have been examining organisms, there is reason to believe that additional time would allow for larger scale evolution, such as \"humans from chimps\" (sticking with the common Creationist misconception). But is this just extrapolation? No! Multiple scientific evidences support the position that humans and chimps shared a common ancestor. \n \n First, human and chimp DNA is between 95% and 99.4% identical (it depends upon whether or not one counts insertions and deletions and whether or not one looks at just protein-coding genes). \n \n \n\"Here we compare [approximately] 90 kb of coding DNA nucleotide sequence from 97 human genes to their sequenced chimpanzee counterparts and to available sequenced gorilla, orangutan, and Old World monkey counterparts, and, on a more limited basis, to mouse. The nonsynonymous changes (functionally important [because they change the coded-for amino acid]), like synonymous changes (functionally much less important [since both code for the same amino acid]), show chimpanzees and humans to be most closely related, sharing 99.4% identity at nonsynonymous sites and 98.4% at synonymous sites.\" (Implications of natural selection in shaping 99.4% nonsynonymous DNA identity between humans and chimpanzees: Enlarging genus Homo, Derek E. Wildman , Monica Uddin , Guozhen Liu , Lawrence I. Grossman and Morris Goodman, PNAS, June 10 2003, vol. 100 no. 12, 7181-7188) \n\n \n Second, although chimps have 24 pairs of chromosomes and humans only 23 pairs, one of the human chromosomes is the result of a fusion of two separate chromosomes our common ancestor with chimps possessed. Is this just an ad hoc explanation for why we humans have one less pair of chromosomes? No. That fusion occurred can be seen by examining the 2 chimp chromosomes that would have fused and noticing the match of banding patterns and the presence of telomere sequences in the middle of the corresponding one human chromosome. \n \n \n\"Humans have 46 chromosomes, whereas chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan have 48. This major karyotypic difference was caused by the fusion of two ancestral chromosomes to form human chromosome 2 and subsequent inactivation of one of the two original centromeres (Yunis and Prakash 1982). As a result of this fusion, sequences that once resided near the ends of the ancestral chromosomes are now located in the middle of chromosome 2, near the borders of bands 2q13 and 2q14.1. For brevity, we refer henceforth to the region surrounding the fusion as 2qFus. Two head-to-head arrays of degenerate telomere repeats are found at this site; their head-to-head orientation indicates that chromosome 2 resulted from a telomere-to-telomere fusion (Ijdo et al. 1991).\n \n ...\n \n The gross characteristics of the chromosomal fusion that gave rise to human chromosome 2 were apparent 20 years ago, when Yunis and Prakash aligned the high-resolution banding patterns of human, chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan chromosomes (Yunis and Prakash 1982). The identities of the fusion partners were confirmed 10 years later when human chromosome-2 specific DNA was observed to \"paint\" chimpanzee chromosomes 12 and 13 (Jauch et al. 1992; Wienberg et al. 1992). Because the fused chromosome is unique to humans and is fixed, the fusion must have occurred after the human-chimpanzee split, but before modern humans spread around the world, that is, between ~6 and ~1 million years ago (Mya; Chen and Li 2001; Yu et al. 2001) (Fig. 5). This gross karyotypic change may have helped to reinforce reproductive barriers between early Homo sapiens and other species, as the F1 offspring would have had reduced fertility because of the risk of unbalanced segregation of chromosomes during meiosis. \" (Genomic Structure and Evolution of the Ancestral Chromosome Fusion Site in 2q13-2q14.1 and Paralogous Regions on Other Human Chromosomes, Yuxin Fan, Elena Linardopoulou, Cynthia Friedman, Eleanor Williams, and Barbara J. Trask1, Genome Research, Vol. 12, Issue 11, 1651-1662, November 2002) \n\n \n \n\"We have identified two allelic genomic cosmids from human chromosome 2, c8.1 and c29B, each containing two inverted arrays of the vertebrate telomeric repeat in a head-to-head arrangement, 5'(TTAGGG)n-(CCCTAA)m3'. Sequences flanking this telomeric repeat are characteristic of present-day human pretelomeres. BAL-31 nuclease experiments with yeast artificial chromosome clones of human telomeres and fluorescence in situ hybridization reveal that sequences flanking these inverted repeats hybridize both to band 2q13 and to different, but overlapping, subsets of human chromosome ends. We conclude that the locus cloned in cosmids c8.1 and c29B is the relic of an ancient telomere-telomere fusion and marks the point at which two ancestral ape chromosomes fused to give rise to human chromosome 2.\" (JW Ijdo, A Baldini, DC Ward, ST Reeders, and RA Wells, Origin of Human Chromosome 2: An Ancestral Telomere-Telomere Fusion, PNAS 1991; 88: 9051-9055). \n\n \n Third, the banding patterns of at least two human chromosomes (chromosomes 2 and 6) are virtually identical to those of the corresponding chromosomes in chimps (and some other primates, such as orangutans). \n \n \n\"The ideograms represent selected primate chromosomes from 1000-band late prophase preparations. Human (H) chromosomes 2, 5 and 6 are illustrated together with the corresponding orthologs in chimpanzee (C), gorilla (G) and orangutan (O). Human chromosome 2 appears to have evolved by fusion of two primate chromosomes (with the point of fusion possibly at 2q13). Note the extremely similar structures for human chromosome 6 and its orthologs - the only readily visible differences are due to additional telomeric heterochromatin on the short arm of the chimpanzee ortholog, and on both arms of the gorilla ortholog (see arrows). In contrast, the orthologs of human chromosome 5 show appreciable differences. They include a pericentric inversion in the chimpanzee chromosome with breakpoints corresponding to human 5p13 and 5q13, and considerable differences in the gorilla ortholog (which has undergone a reciprocal translocation with a chromosome corresponding to human chromosome 17).

Chimps and other primates too cannot manufacture vitamin C because their genes also are nonfunctional pseudogenes.\n \n \n\"Recently, the L-gulano-&#947;-lactone oxidase gene, the gene required for Vitamin C synthesis, was found in humans and guinea pigs (Nishikimi et al. 1992; Nishikimi et al. 1994). It exists as a pseudogene, present but incapable of functioning (see prediction 4.4 for more about pseudogenes). In fact, since this was originally written the vitamin C pseudogene has been found in other primates, exactly as predicted by evolutionary theory. We now have the DNA sequences for this broken gene in chimpanzees, orangutans, and macaques (Ohta and Nishikimi 1999). And, as predicted, the malfunctioning human and chimpanzee pseudogenes are the most similar, followed by the human and orangutan genes, followed by the human and macaque genes, precisely as predicted by evolutionary theory. Furthermore, all of these genes have accumulated mutations at the exact rate predicted (the background rate of mutation for neutral DNA regions like pseudogenes) (Ohta and Nishikimi 1999).\" \n (http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/section2.html#past_biogeography_ex3) \n\n \n Fifth, both humans and great apes have nonfunctional Uox (urate oxidase) genes. Further, the nucleotide substitution that causes the human and great ape genes to be nonfunctional is identical.\n \n \n\"We have determined and compared the promoter, coding, and intronic sequences of the urate oxidase (Uox) gene of various primate species. Although we confirm the previous observation that the inactivation of the gene in the clade of the human and the great apes results from a single CGA to TGA nonsense mutation in exon 2...\" (Loss of urate oxidase activity in hominoids and its evolutionary implications, Oda M, Satta Y, Takenaka O, Takahata N., Mol Biol Evol. 2002 May;19(5):640-53) \n\n \n Sixth, the beta-globin genes in humans and chimps (and gorillas) are organized in the same manner, and pseudogene versions of one those genes share multiple, identical substitutions in the three species.\n \n \n\"The beta-globin gene cluster of human, gorilla and chimpanzee contain the same number and organization of beta-type globin genes: 5'-epsilon (embryonic)-G gamma and A gamma (fetal)-psi beta (inactive)-delta and beta (adult)-3'. We have isolated the psi beta-globin gene regions from the three species and determined their nucleotide sequences. These three pseudogenes each share the same substitutions in the initiator codon (ATG----GTA), a substitution in codon 15 which generates a termination signal TGG----TGA, nucleotide deletion in codon 20 and the resulting frame shift which yields many termination signals in exons 2 and 3.\" (Isolation and nucleotide sequence analysis of the beta-type globin pseudogene from human, gorilla and chimpanzee. Chang LY, Slightom JL., J Mol Biol., Dec 25 1984;180(4):767-84) \n\n \n Seventh, both humans and chimps have a CYP21P pseudogene, and both are pseudogenes because they share the same 8-basepair deletion.\n \n \n\"We prepared a cosmid library from chimpanzee DNA ... The clones could be arranged into two overlapping clusters covering the entire C4 region of both chromosomes in this particular heterozygous chimpanzee. The region is about 100 kilobases (kb) long and contains two C4 and two CYP21 genes, the latter coding for the enzyme 21-hydroxylase. Using oligonucleotide probes we identified the genes as corresponding to human C4A, C4B, CYP21 and CYP21P genes. The last gene apparently contains an 8-base pair (bp) deletion (as does the corresponding human gene), which renders it a pseudogene.\" (Organization of the chimpanzee C4-CYP21 region: implications for the evolution of human genes, Kawaguchi H, Golubic M, Figueroa F, Klein J., Eur J Immunol. 1990 Apr;20(4):739-45) \n\n \n Eighth and ninth, the ZNF75B gene (which codes for a zinc finger protein; zinc finger proteins are one type of DNA-binding protein, and their binding to DNA can influence the expression of other genes) is a pseudogene in both humans and chimps (as well as gorillas and orangutans), and the ZNF75 gene in humans and its homolog in chimps are both located on Xq26 (a particular region of the queen - that is, longer - arm of the X chromosome).\n \n \n\"We have previously reported (Villa et al. (1993), Genomics 18: 223) the characterization of the human ZNF75 gene located on Xq26, which has only limited homology (less than 65%) to other ZF genes in the databases. Here, we describe three human zinc finger genes with 86 to 95% homology to ZNF75 at the nucleotide level, which represent all the members of the human ZNF75 subfamily. One of these, ZNF75B, is a pseudogene mapped to chromosome 12q13. The other two, ZNF75A and ZNF75C, maintain an ORF in the sequenced region, and at least the latter is expressed in the U937 cell line. They were mapped to chromosomes 16 and 11, respectively. All these genes are conserved in chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. The ZNF75B homologue is a pseudogene in all three great apes, and in chimpanzee it is located on chromosome 10 (phylogenetic XII), at p13 (corresponding to the human 12q13). The chimpanzee homologue of ZNF75 is also located on the Xq26 chromosome, in the same region, as detected by in situ hybridization. As expected, nucleotide changes were clearly more abundant between human and orangutan than between human and chimpanzee or gorilla homologues.\" (The ZNF75 Zinc Finger Gene Subfamily: Isolation and Mapping of the Four Members in Humans and Great Apes, Villa A., Strina D., Frattini A., Faranda S., Macchi P., Finelli P., Bozzi F., Susani L., Archidiacono N., Rocchi M., Vezzoni P., Genomics, July 1996, vol. 35, no. 2, pp. 312-320(9)) \n\n \n Tenth, a COX4 pseudogene (which codes for a protein used in the \"electron transport chain\" of aerobic respiration) just under 2,000 DNA bases long is shared by humans, chimps, and gorillas...but is not found in orangutans or macaque monkeys.\n \n \n\"We have isolated a chimpanzee processed pseudogene for subunit IV of cytochrome c oxidase (COX; EC 1.9.3.1) by screening a chimpanzee genomic library in lambda Charon 32 with a bovine liver cDNA encoding COX subunit IV (COX IV), and localized it to a 1.9-kb HindIII fragment. Southern-blot analysis of genomic DNA from five primates showed that DNAs from human, gorilla, and chimpanzee each contained the 1.9-kb pseudogene fragment, whereas orangutan and pigtail macaque monkey DNA did not. This result clearly indicates that the pseudogene arose before the divergence of the chimpanzee and gorilla from the primate lineage. By screening Chinese hamster x human hybrid panels with the human COX4 cDNA, we have mapped COX4 genes to two human chromosomes, 14 and 16. The 1.9-kb HindIII fragment containing the pseudogene, COX4P1, can be assigned to chromosome 14, and by means of rearranged chromosomes in somatic cell hybrids, to 14q21-qter. Similarly, the functional gene, COX4, has been mapped to 16q22-qter.\" (Novel use of a chimpanzee pseudogene for chromosomal mapping of human cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV. Lomax MI, Welch MD, Darras BT, Francke U, Grossman LI., Gene. 1990 Feb 14;86(2):209-16.) \n\n \n And eleventh...\n \n \n\"The amino acid sequence of the chimpanzee's hemoglobin is identical to that of the human; those of the gorilla and rhesus monkey differ from the human's in 2 and 15 amino acids, respectively.\" (Biology: Fifth Edition, Eldra Pearl Solomon, Linda R. Berg, and Diana W. Martin, Saunders College Publishing, 1999, p451) \n\n \n Besides the many genetic evidences that humans and chimps share a common ancestor, there are also the expected - and several possibly unexpected - anatomical similarities between chimp and human brains. \n \n The following pictures show (if you are already familiar with the anatomy of the human brain) that the chimpanzee brain is a near twin of ours (the biggest anatomical giveaway that this is a chimp's brain is that the brain stem projects backwards, instead of downwards as it does in humans...because of our upright posture).\n \n (image from http://brainmuseum.org/Specimens/primates/chimp/brain/chimp6sect6.jpg)\n \n \n 1) There is an asymmetry in the planum temporale in both human and chimp brains.\n \n \n\"Researchers at Columbia, Mount Sinai School of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health have found that a region of the brain thought to control language is larger in one hemisphere in both chimpanzees and humans, disproving a theory that the brain section was asymmetrical only in humans. \n \n The discovery, reported in the Jan. 9 issue of the journal Science, throws into question the role of the planum temporale, a part of the brain's temporal cortex that is located beneath the parietal cortex. The planum temporale of the left hemisphere is normally larger than in the right hemisphere in humans, but 94 percent of the chimpanzee brains studied demonstrated the same asymmetry.\" (http://www.columbia.edu/cu/record/archives/vol23/vol23_iss12/27.html) \n\n \n 2) A further brain asymmetry is shared between humans and chimps: that of the hippocampus. Yet the nearby amygdala is symmetrical in both.\n \n \n\"In the first study, Hani Freeman, BA, Claudio Catalupo, PhD (also with Georgia State University), and William Hopkins, PhD (also with Berry College), took magnetic resonance images of 60 chimpanzees to measure the anatomy of two key structures in their brains' limbic systems, an early-evolving central region that includes the hippocampus and amygdala. In the MRI pictures, the hippocampus (which regulates learning and consolidation of spatial memory, mood, appetite and sleep) was asymmetrical, its right half significantly larger than its left. This asymmetry was bigger in males. These findings are consistent with studies of human hippocampi, which are also asymmetrical. At the same time, just as in humans, the amygdalas of the chimps were symmetrical. \n \n Studies such as this confirm that human and chimp brains are not only asymmetrical, but asymmetrical in the same way.\" (http://www.apa.org/releases/chimpbrains.html) \n\n \n 3) Because of their neuroanatomy, most chimps, like humans, are right handed.\n \n \n\"In a second study, Hopkins and Cantalupo report the first-ever evidence of an association between hand preference and asymmetries in three areas of the brain cortex in chimps. Observing 66 chimps, they correlated asymmetries in brain anatomy with three measures of handedness: Simple reaching (which hand chimps used to pick up a raisin thrown into the cage), two-handed feeding (which hand chimps used to feed themselves chunks of fruit while holding the whole piece, such as a banana, in the other hand), and a measure of coordinated bimanual actions (which hand chimps used to fish peanut butter from a plastic tube with a finger). \n \n Left-handed and right-handed chimps differed relative to the asymmetries in two primary motor areas, the planum temporale and the precentral gyrus. Say the authors, the results \"challenge the long-held belief that the neurobiological substrates for handedness are unique to humans.\" Just as in humans, neuroanatomy governs whether a chimp becomes a lefty or a righty. Hopkins points out that chimps are also strongly right-handed for manual gestures and throwing, a clue to the origins of more general right-hand dominance in both chimps and humans.\"\n (December 5, 2004, http://www.apa.org/releases/chimpbrains.html ) \n\n \n 4) Can an animal seeing its reflection in a mirror recognize the reflection as being of itself? No. Unless it is one of an extremely few exceptional species, such as humans, chimpanzees, or orangutans.\n \n \n\"Many other animals, including a variety of primates, elephants, birds and even dolphins, have been tested for self-recognition. But only chimpanzees, orangutans and humans have consistently passed this test.\" (Can Animals Empathize?, Gordon Gallup Jr., Scientific American, 1998, p67) \n\n \n \n So that we humans evolved from a common ancestor we shared with chimps is not mere extrapolation from the confirmed processes of microevolution and speciation: rather, it is also supported by a multitude of convincing genetic and neurological evidences.\n \n \n YEC ORIGIN OF HUMANS\n Let's see, what observations or objective information tell us that a supernatural being poofed fully formed man into existence, only about 6 to 10 thousand years ago, and then yanked out a rib to create woman? None. Zip. Zilch. All that supports those religious assumptions is a book written several thousand years ago, translated and mistranslated time after time over the years during various transcriptions of it, with the book containing second-hand and third-hand stories, written by people completely ignorant of modern biology, astronomy, geology, physics, and other sciences, as well as being grossly superstitious. \n \n But let's spend a few minutes considering what it would mean for a Creationist God to have created humans. More precisely, we are looking at two possible explanations for human origins: Creation (special creation by God about 10,000 years ago) and evolution (our species arising by descent with modification over millions of years). Let's consider just the first piece of genetic evidence provided above (the ~99% identity between chimp and human DNA) and ask which of the two possibilities is the better explanation.\n \n According to Creationists, God is an all-knowing, all-powerful, all-righteous supernatural being who created the entire Universe in only 6 days: His powers are unlimited and He knows the past, the present, and the future. But then why would God have created humans and chimps to share ~99% identity in their DNA? \n \n First, God could have created humans with completely different DNA sequences, but He didn't. For example, God could have zapped humans into existence with a gene for hemoglobin that is only, say, 50% or 75% identical to that of chimpanzees. Why did God make it exactly identical? Worse, why did He make the human and chimpanzee base sequence for hemoglobin identical, yet make them different from that of other animals? And, in just the right manner to give the supposedly false illusion of a hierarchical system (groups within groups) of relationships, that He also tricked scientists into believe by falsely creating a vast number of other genes that also demonstrate the same nested grouping? For some unexplained reason, God knowingly chose to make our DNA - not just for hemoglobin, but for a whole host of other genes too - so similar to chimps that it convincingly gives the supposedly false illusion that we share a common ancestor with them? Why? That would be knowingly misleading ... grossly misleading. But wait, there's more.\n \n Second, God is all powerful and not limited by the laws of nature...He could have created humans that didn't even have DNA! We humans could be based on some weird genetic molecule called \"ZNA\", made of inorganic metals like zinc and iron, while all other life was based on DNA. Now that would be great evidence that we were created separately from all other life. So why wouldn't God have done that? Instead, He chose - knowing the future - to create humans with DNA, and with DNA ~99% identical to chimps, to mislead people into falsely believing humans and chimps evolved from a common ancestor? \n \n Third, why did God even create chimps? If God didn't create chimps (and other similar primates) that are so genetically similar to humans, which He assuredly could have done, we wouldn't even be having this discussion! He didn't have to create chimps in order to create humans...He controls the whole Universe. Maybe He wanted to plant more misleading evidence...laying it on extra thick. \n \n All of these things God did, intentionally, knowing the future. Why? It sure appears that He did so specifically to mislead future scientists into believing \"the lie\" of evolution.",

There's a big difference.\n \n So if you substitute the word faith instead of religion in your above sentence, you are absolutely correct.\n \n And we will continue to discover even more evidence that supports that idea.

He just doesn't care.\n \n But I've seen other dogs assume it's another dog at first, then clue in, and forever after realize that it's just themselves.\n\n \n Do they really realize its themselves? Consider this from the article...\n \n \n\"Despite this extended opportunity to learn about the mirror, neither monkey ever showed any evidence of self-recognition. On the other hand, when I would walk into the room where they were kept and they saw my reflection in the mirror, they would immediately turn to confront me directly. So it was not that they were incapable of learning to interpret mirrored information about other objects correctly.\" (Can Animals Empathize?, Gordon Gallup Jr., Scientific American, 1998, p68) \n\n \n Just realizing that a reflection is not another animal is not in itself enough to establish that the animal is capable of self-recognition.\n \n \n \nMy dogs and my cats too. I've watched them when young look behind a mirror, but they figure it out. They seem quite aware that they are looking at themselves in the mirror.

   "What I was ultimately trying to do was make everyone happy (not possible I know) by refering to the universe and everything in it as God. I thought that this would be grounds for religion and science to agree on, I was obviously wrong.\n\n \n Let me explain a bit more in depth why I object to your attempted redefintion of God.\n \n You are trying to define that which is SUPERNATURAL as being PURELY NATURAL. That's would be a direct contradiction, and could be considered a silly thing to try to do. Hence, one reason I said you're playing a silly word game. In addition, you are trying to define that which is considered a BEING as being that which is NOT a being. And you are trying to define that which is PERFECT as being that which is NOT perfect. And you are trying to define that which has WISDOM with that which does NOT have wisdom. Finally (at least as far as I'll point out), you are trying to define that which humans WORSHIP with something you say should NOT be worshipped. The commonly accepted ideas of what God is, on the one hand, and what you were proposing on the other, are not consistent with one another. \n \n Now, if we were to follow your lead and redefine God as being the laws of nature and all of matter, then we would no longer be talking about God, but rather, about the laws of nature and all of matter. If the two things were exactly equal, as you propose, then there would no longer be any need for the superfluous word - indeed, THE UTTERLY SUPERFLUOUS CONCEPT - GOD. \n \n And what would be wrong with our just redefining SANTA CLAUS as being the laws of nature and all of matter? (Would public schools have to start allotting equal time to the study of Santa Claus in science classes?!?!) Of course, I imagine you'd recognize THIS attempt at a redefinition as being just a silly word game. I see the two as quite similar.\n \n One might look at it this way ... you yourself show that you are playing a silly word game by having to mention that you would be REDEFINING God. \n \n \n PS: I have heard something about Pantheists (IIRC), and believe they hold a view at least somewhat similar to what you were proposing, but I'm not any more familiar with their position than that. If you feel your proposal had some merit you might want to check into their views.",

   " Now Sarai, Abram's wife, had borne him no children. But she had an Egyptian maidservant named Hagar; so she said to Abram, \"The Lord has kept me from having children. Go, sleep with my maidservant; perhaps I can build a family through her.\"\n \n Abram agreed to what Sarai said. So after Abram had been living in Canaan ten years, Sarai his wife took here Egyptian maidservant Hagar and gave her to her husband to be his wife. He slept with Hagar, and she conceived.\n \n When she knew she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress. Then Sarai said the Abram, \"You are responsible for the wrong I am suffering. I put my servant in your arms, and now that she knows she is pregnant, she despises me. May the Lord judge between you and me.\"\n \n \"Your servant is in your hands,\" Abram said. \"Do with here whatever you think best.\" Then Sarai mistreated Hagar; so she fled from her.\n \n The angel of the Lord found Hagar near a spring in the desert; it was the spring that is beside the road to Shur. And he said, \"Hagar, servant of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?\"\n \n \"I'm running away from my mistress Sarai,\" she answered.\n \n Then the angel of the Lord told her, \"Go back to your mistress and submit to her.\" The angel added, \"I will so increase your descendants that they will be too numerous to count.\n \n Then the angel of the Lord also said to her:\n \n \"You are now with child\n and you will have a son.\n You shall name him Ishmael,\n for the Lord has heard of your misery.\n ...\"\n \n So Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram gave the name Ishmael to the son she had borne.\n (Genesis 16:1-11, 15)\n \n\n \n \n \nBefore they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom - both young and old - surrounded the house. They called to Lot, \"Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them.\"\n \n Lot went outside to meet them and shut the door behind him and said, \"No, my friends. Don't do this wicked thing. Look, I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. Let me bring them to you, and you can do what you like with them. But don't do anything to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof.\"\n (Genesis 19:4-8)\n \n\n \n \n \nOne day the older daughter said to the younger, \"Our father is old, and there is no man around here to lie with us, as is the custom all over the earth. Let's get our father to drink wine and then lie with him and preserve our family line through our father.\"\n \n That night they got their father to drink wine, and the older daughter went in and lay with him. He was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up.\n \n The next day the older daughter said to the younger, \"Last night I lay with my father. Let's get him to drink wine again tonight, and you go in and lie with him so we can preserve our family line through our father.\" So they got their father to drink wine that night also, and the younger daughter went and lay with him. Again he was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up.\n \n So both of Lot's daughters became pregnant by their father.\n (Genesis 19:31-36)\n \n\n \n \n \nAbraham replied, \"I said to myself, 'There is surely no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife. Besides, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father though not of my mother; and she became my wife. \n (Genesis 20:1-18 ... somewhere in there)\n \n\n \n \n \n \nEsau then realized how displeasing the Canaanite women were to his father Isaac; so he went to Ishmael and married Mahalath, the sister of Nebaioth and daughter of Ishmael son of Abraham, in addition to the wives he already had.\n (Genesis 28:8-9)\n \n\n \n \n \nWhen Jacob saw Rachel daughter or Laban, his mother's brother, and Laban's sheep, he went over and rolled the stone away from the mouth of the well and watered his uncle's sheep. Then Jacob kissed Rachel and began to weep aloud. He had told Rachel that he was a relative of her father and a son of Rebekah. So she ran and told her father.\n \n As soon as Laban heard the news about Jacob, his sister's son, he hurried to meet him. He embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his home, and there Jacob told him all these things.\n \n ...\n \n Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. Leah had weak eyes, but Rachel was lovely in form, and beautiful. Jacob was in love with Rachel and said, \"I'll work for you seven years in return for your younger daughter Rachel.\"\n \n Laban said, \"It's better than I give her to you than to some other man. Stay here with me.\" So Jacob served Laban seven years to get Rachel, but they seemed like only a few days to him because of his love for her.\n \n Then Jacob said to Laban, \"Give me my wife. My time is completed, and I want to lie with her.\"\n \n So Laban brought together all the people of the place and gave a feast. But when evening came, he took his daughter Leah and gave her to Jacob, and Jacob lay with her. And Laban gave his servant girl Zilpah to his daughter as a maidservant.\n \n When morning came, there was Leah! So Jacob said to Laban, \"What is this you have done to me? I served you for Rachel, did I not? Why have you deceived me?\"\n \n Laban replied, \"It is not our custom here to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older. Finish this daughter's bridal week; then we will give you the younger one also, in return for another seven years of work.\"\n \n And Jacob did so. He finished the week with Leah, and then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife. Laban gave his servant girl Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her maidservant. Jacob lay with Rachel also, and he loved Rachel more than Leah. And he word for Laban another seven years.\n (Genesis 29:10-13, 16-30)\n \n\n \n \n \n \nDuring the harvest, Reuben went out into the fields and found some mandrake plants, which he brought to his mother Leah. \n Rachel said to Leah, \"Please give me some of your son's mandrakes.\" But she said to her, \"Wasn't it enough that you took away my husband? Will you now take my son's mandrakes too?\"\n \n \"Very well\", Rachel said, \"he can sleep with you tonight in return for your son's mandrakes.\"\n \n So when Jacob came in from the fields that evening, Leah went out to meet him. \"You must sleep with me,\" she said. \"I have hired you with my son's mandrakes.\" So he slept with her that night.\n (Genesis 30:14-16)\n \n\n \n \n There's much more soap opera - men married to multiple wives at once, men sleeping with servants while married, God killing a man for \"spilling his seed on the ground\", women dressing up like prositutes to fool their father-in-law to sleep with them and impregnate her, etc. - from just Genesis, but I don't have it all typed out yet.",

   "Let's take a look at the soap opera that was Abraham (originally called Abram in the Bible) and Sarah (originally called Sarai in the Bible).\n \n \nNow Sarai, Abram's wife, had borne him no children. But she had an Egyptian maidservant named Hagar; so she said to Abram, \"The Lord has kept me from having children. Go, sleep with my maidservant; perhaps I can build a family through her.\"\n \n Abram agreed to what Sarai said. So after Abram had been living in Canaan ten years, Sarai his wife took her Egyptian maidservant Hagar and gave her to her husband to be his wife. He slept with Hagar, and she conceived.\n (Genesis 16:1-4)\n \n\n \n What? Our dear father Abraham not only has concubines, but also slept with another woman, and they had a baby, while he was married to Sarah? Well, in fact, several leading male characters have multiple wives simultaneously in Genesis.\n \n But does God condone this? Yes! \n \n \nThen Sarai mistreated Hagar; so she fled from her.\n \n The angel of the Lord found Hagar near a spring in the desert; it was the spring that is beside the road to Shur. And he said, \"Hagar, servant of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?\"\n \n \"I'm running away from my mistress Sarai,\" she answered.\n \n Then the angel of the Lord told her, \"Go back to your mistress and submit to her.\" The angel added, \"I will so increase your descendants that they will be too numerous to count.\"\n \n Then the angel of the Lord also said to her:\n \n \"You are now with child\n and you will have a son.\n You shall name him Ishmael,\n for the Lord has heard of your misery.\n ...\"\n \n So Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram gave the name Ishmael to the son she had borne.\n (Genesis 16:6-11, 15)\n \n\n \n \n So God doesn't even think about punishing Abraham, Sarah, or Hagar. In fact, he seems pretty cool about the whole thing!\n \n Oddly enough, the 'opposite' happens too. That is, Sarah and Abraham 'pretend' to be brother and sister instead of husband and wife, so the beautiful Sarah is taken to Pharaoh who marries her: now Sarah is married to two men at once. \n \n \nSo Pharaoh summoned Abram. \"What have you done to me?\" he said. \"Why didn't you tell me she was your wife? Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so that I took her to be my wife? Now then, here is your wife. Take here and go!\"\n (Genesis 12:17-19)\n \n\n \n But let's not let Abraham off too easily. It's not like he just slept with one servant girl while he was married. \n \n \nAbraham left everything he owned to Isaac. But while he was still living, he gave gifts to the sons of his concubines and sent them away from his son Isaac to the land of the east.\n (Genesis 25:5-6)\n \n\n \n What? Our dear father Abraham had concubines? And not concubine, but concubines ... plural. Good thing no one believes the Bible should be used as a moral guide.\n \n Before moving on, let me expose more of the soap opera. Abraham and Sarah are married, and they sleep together but it takes a while before they eventually have a son. The icky part is that Sarah is Abraham's half sister!\n \n You see, Abraham and Sarah pull their little 'trick' on someone else: they say that they are brother and sister instead of husband and wife, and once again, another man takes Sarah for his own (though he never gets around to marrying or sleeping with her).\n \n \nThen Abimelech called Abraham in and said, \"What have you done to us? How have I wronged you that you have brought such great guilt upon me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that should not be done.\" And Abimelech asked Abraham, \"What was your reason for doing this?\"\n \n Abraham replied, \"I said to myself, 'There is surely no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife. Besides, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father though not of my mother; and she became my wife. \n (Genesis 20:9-12)\n \n\n \n Yuck!!! Maybe the Bible is trying to tell us, \"Incest is best, put your sister to the test!\" \n \n Well, if you think about what happened to Lot, maybe the Bible's message in sex is, \"Incest is best, put your father to the test!\"\n \n Was just sleeping with a bunch of other women while married to Sarah his only personality flaw? Nope.\n \n \n\"Then God said [to Abraham], \"Take your son, your only son, Isaac, whom you love, and go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains I will tell you about.\"\n \n ...\n \n When they reached the place God had told him about, Abraham built an altar there and arranged wood on it. He bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood. Then he reached out his hand and took the knife to slay his son. But the angel of the Lord called out to him from heaven, \"Abraham! Abraham!\"\n \n \"Here I am,\" he replied.\n \n \"Do not lay a hand on the boy,\" he said. \"Do not do anything to him. Now I know that you fear God, because you have not withheld from me your son, your only son.\"\n \n ...\n \n The angel of the Lord called to Abraham from heaven a second time and said, \"I swear by myself, declares the Lord, that because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son, I will surely bless you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as the sand on the seashore.\"\n (Genesis 22:2, 9-12, 15-17)\n \n\n \n What a horrible thing for any father to do to his son. Does anyone really think Isaac just passively stood there and let his father bind him and lay him up on an altar to be burned alive? Of course not ... that's why Abraham had to bind him. There must have been an intense struggle: the young boy must have been physically overpowered by his father, bound, then laid up on the altar. Horrifying. And as if that nightmare weren't enough, then Isaac - bound and helpless - had to watch as his father came at him wielding a knife with which to slay him! \n \n I guess the Bible is trying to teach us that if we hear voices in head, we should do what they say, no matter how gruesome the act might be. Sure, that's the right thing to do.\n \n But there's more to the story than the awful example Abraham sets for parents. It shows that God is not infallible!\n \n The Bible tells us quite clearly that God said Isaac was Abraham's only son. In fact, God - or the angel of the Lord, who seems to be God himself, or at least able to speak with authority on God's behalf - says it twice more: a total of three times in that one story.\n \n So is Isaac really Abraham's only son, as God said? No! \n \n \nThen Abraham breathed his last and died at a good old age, an old man and full of years; and he was gathered to his people. His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him ...\n (Genesis 25:8-9)\n \n\n \n So we know Abraham had another son, Ishmael, and that he outlived Abraham. But maybe Ishmael was not yet born when God commanded Abraham to kill his 'only' son Jacob. Nope!\n \n \nThis is the account of Abraham's son Ishmael, whom Sarah's maidservant, Hagar the Egyptian, bore to Abraham.\n (Genesis 25:12)\n \n\n \n Ishmael was the son that Abraham had with the maidservant, Hagar, that his wife Sarah told him to sleep with, which he did and she got pregnant and had a child. That happened back in Genesis 16; it's not until Genesis 22 that God commands Abraham to kill his 'only' son Isaac.\n \n Well, maybe the chronology in the Bible is out of whack, and what happened in Genesis 22 actually occurred before that which happened in Genesis 16. Nope!\n \n Remember, back in Genesis 16 the reason that Sarah gives her servant to Abraham to sleep with is because Sarah has not yet bore any children. Yet Isaac is Abraham's and Sarah's son! \n \n \nNow the Lord was gracious to Sarah, as he had said, and the Lord did for Sarah what he had promised. Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the very time God had promised him. Abraham gave the name Isaac to the son Sarah had bore him. ... Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.\n (Genesis 21:1-3, 5)\n \n\n \n So Isaac had to come after Ishmael, since Sarah had not yet had any children when Abraham had Ishmael through Hagar.\n \n That's logic, and it's air tight. But there's actually even better, direct proof in the Bible.\n \n \nGod also said to Abraham, \"As for Sarai, your wife, you are no longer to call here Sarai; her name will be Sarah. I will bless her and will surely give you a son by her. I will bless her so that she will be the mother of nations; kings of peoples will come from her.\n \n Abraham fell facedown; he laughed and said to himself, \"Will a son be born to a man a hundred years old? Will Sarah bear a child at the age of ninety?\" And Abraham said to God, \"If only Ishmael might live under your blessings!\"\n \n Then God said, \"Yes, but your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you will call him Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him. And as for Ishmael, I have heard you: I will surely bless him. ... But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you by this time next year.\" When he had finished speaking with Abraham, God went up from him.\n \n On that very day Abraham took his son Ishmael and all those born in his household or bought with his money, every male in his household, and circumcised them, as God told him. Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised, and his son Ishmael was thirteen.\n (Genesis 17:15-26)\n \n\n \n Note that Ishmael was Abraham's son, and was already 13 years old when God told Abraham that he would have a son named Isaac in one year. So clearly Ishmael was born before Isaac.\n \n Further, note that we are told in Genesis 21:5 that Abraham was 100 years old when Isaac was born, but he was only 99 when he was circumcised, which, on that same day, Ishmael was already 13. Again, clearly Ishmael was born before Isaac.\n \n Also, remember that Ishmael was there when Abraham died.\n \n So Ishmael was born 13 years before Isaac, and was still living after his father had died. That means that Ishmael, Abraham's first son, had to have been alive when God commanded Abraham to kill his 'only' son Isaac.\n \n There's no way that Isaac was Abraham's only son when God command Abraham to kill his 'only' son Isaac. God goofed.\n \n \n What are a few things we have learned about the Bible/Genesis in this quick look at Abraham and Sarah.\n \n 1) Men having sex with other women while married is okay.\n Abraham slept with another woman - a servant named Hagar - while he was married to Sarah, and God not only didn't seem to mind, he seemed to give it a good ole two thumbs up.\n \n 2) A man having multiple concubines is okay.\n \n 3) Incest is okay ... sure, go ahead and marry, sleep with, and have kids by, your half sister.\n \n 4) If you hear voices in your head telling you to overpower your son, tie him up, throw him up on some firewood, brutally stab him, and then burn him to death, by all means, the right thing to do is to go ahead and do it.\n \n 5) God makes mistakes.\n He didn't even know that Abraham had another son, Ishmael.",

   "Originally posted by Cush\n \nUnderstanding the Trinity doesn't always seem logical, but that doesn't give me the POWER to denounce everything. This is because I've also come to understand that there is more than meets the eye, more than can be deduced, more than can be understood by our feeble minds. Our minds are finite. Yet we try to grapple with the infinite. That is why the crucifixion happened in human terms, on our planet.\n\n \n This is one of the things that really annoys me about religion; the assumption that there are things which cannot be understood by \"our feeble minds\".\n Who says our minds are feeble? Consider the amount of knowledge contained within the mind of a man c100,000 years ago. Now consider the amount of knowledge you could contain within your mind in the present day after a lifetime of studying history, maths, science and philosophy. That doesn't seem very feeble to me.\n The original concept of a God was born from ignorance - people didn't know how to explain natural disasters, the stars, the seasons, illness, or pretty much anything. So everything was attributed to a God. \n We are still left with mysteries today, but the big ones are the origins of the universe and of life. (We've come a pretty long way from pondering the cause of rain, haven't we?)\n Of course these are the things that the faithful cling to in order to \"prove\" their God's existence. \"How can you explain our existence,\" they clamour, \"without accepting that God did it? It is too complex! It is beyond us!\"\n I believe that it is not beyond us. If science is allowed to progress, eventually we will understand the mechanisms behind the mysteries.\n If we could ask ancient man to prove his God's existence, he would smile and say \"Who else brings the rain? Who else moves the sun across the sky?\"",

Why would you even expect humans to be able to see that occur firsthand? What we have are multiple, independent lines of evidence that show us that this occurred in nature. We have transitional fossils, anatomical similarities, genetic similarities, and similar embryonic development, as well as a supported, purely natural theory that explains all of the similarities.\n \n Here's an interesting example of \"missing links\" in the evolution of multicellularity from unicellular organisms.\n \n \n\"The Volvocaceans\n \n The simpler organisms among the volvocaceans are ordered assemblies of numerous cells, each resembling the unicellular protist Chlamydomonas, to which they are related (Figure 2.11A). A single organism of the volvocacean genus Gonium (Figure 2.11B), for example, consists of a flat plate of 4 to 16 cells, each with its own flagellum. In a related genus, Pandorina, the 16 cells form a sphere (Figure 2.11C); and in Eudorina, the sphere contains 32 or 64 cells arranged in a regular pattern (Figure 2.11D). In these organisms, then, a very important developmental principle has been worked out: the ordered division of one cell to generate a number of cells that are organized in a predictable fashion. As occurs during cleavage in most animal embryos, the cell divisions by which a single volvocacean cell produces an organism of 4 to 64 cells occur in very rapid sequence and in the absence of cell growth.\n \n The next two genera of the volvocacean series exhibit another important principle of development: the differentiation of cell types within an individual organism. The reproductive cells become differentiated from the somatic cells. In all the genera mentioned earlier, every cell can, and normally does, produce a complete new organism by mitosis. In the genera Pleodorina and Volvox, however, relatively few cells can reproduce. In Pleodorina californica (Figure 2.11E), the cells in the anterior region are restricted to a somatic function; only those cells on the posterior side can reproduce. In P. californica, a colony usually has 128 or 64 cells, and the ratio of the number of somatic cells to the number of reproductive cells is usually 3:5. Thus, a 128-cell colony typically has 48 somatic cells, and a 64-cell colony has 24.\n \n In Volvox, almost all the cells are somatic, and very few of the cells are able to produce new individuals. In some species of Volvox, reproductive cells, as in Pleodorina, are derived from cells that originally look and function like somatic cells before they enlarge and divide to form new progeny. However, in other members of the genus, such as V. carteri, there is a complete division of labor: the reproductive cells that will create the next generation are set aside during the division of the original cell that is forming a new individual. The reproductive cells never develop functional flagella and never contribute to motility or other somatic functions of the individual; they are entirely specialized for reproduction. Thus, although the simpler volvocaceans may be thought of as colonial organisms (because each cell is capable of independent existence and of perpetuating the species), in V. carteri we have a truly multicellular organism with two distinct and interdependent cell types (somatic and reproductive), both of which are required for perpetuation of the species (Figure 2.11F). Although not all animals set aside the reproductive cells from the somatic cells (and plants hardly ever do), this separation of germ cells from somatic cells early in development is characteristic of many animal phyla and will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 19.\n \n Although all the volvocaceans, like their unicellular relative Chlamydomonas, reproduce predominantly by asexual means, they are also capable of sexual reproduction, which involves the production and fusion of haploid gametes. In many species of Chlamydomonas, including the one illustrated in Figure 2.10, sexual reproduction is isogamous (\"the same gametes\"), since the haploid gametes that meet are similar in size, structure, and motility. However, in other species of Chlamydomonasas well as many species of colonial volvocaceans swimming gametes of very different sizes are produced by the different mating types. This pattern is called heterogamy (\"different gametes\"). But the larger volvocaceans have evolved a specialized form of heterogamy, called oogamy, which involves the production of large, relatively immotile eggs by one mating type and small, motile sperm by the other (see Sidelights and Speculations). Here we see one type of gamete specialized for the retention of nutritional and developmental resources and the other type of gamete specialized for the transport of nuclei. Thus, the volvocaceans include the simplest organisms that have distinguishable male and female members of the species and that have distinct developmental pathways for the production of eggs or sperm. In all the volvocaceans, the fertilization reaction resembles that of Chlamydomonas in that it results in the production of a dormant diploid zygote, which is capable of surviving harsh environmental conditions. When conditions allow the zygote to germinate, it first undergoes meiosis to produce haploid offspring of the two different mating types in equal numbers. \"\n (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=dbio.section.203)\n \n",

Creationists treat the fossil record as a constructed given, rather than what it is - a wholly contingent assemblage of chance discoveries.

   "New World Translation: small boys\n JST: little children\n NRSV: small boys\n NIV: youths\n New American Bible: small boys\n Today's English version: boys\n NASB: young lads\n ASV: young lads\n Young's Literal Translation: little youths\n \n \n \n Please quote the scriptural justification for the presumption of danger. The verses in 2 Kings refer only to verbal taunting.\n \n \n \n My emphasis. So, it comes back to my original assertion. They were kids making fun of an old man. And for that your god has them torn to pieces by bears?\n \n Yeeurgh.\n\n \n Well no. As you've plainly stated above for us, some translations use the more correct 'youths' or 'young lads' not children. And they were not making fun of him. Do you not understand the reference of 'go up'?\n Please note:\n \n The translation, \"there came forth little children out of the city\" (KJV) is an unfortunate rendition (cf. \"young lads\" - ASV, or \"youths\" - NIV, NKJV). The Hebrew word rendered \"children\" derives from na'ar - used 235 times in the Old Testament. Na'ar is a very broad root word, and can have reference to anyone from a newborn child to an adult. Furthermore, the Hebrew word rendered \"little\" comes from qatan, and generally means young or small. In commenting on this term in 2 Kings 2:23, the Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament remarks: \n \n \"Elisha being taunted (cf. qalas, qarah) by young lads (II Kgs 2:23) who as members of covenant families ought to have been taught God's law whereby cursing his servant was tantamount to cursing him and rightly punishable by death (cf. qalal)\" (Harris, et al., 1980, 2:795). \n Obviously, therefore, the immediate context in which na'ar is used will determine the maturity of the subject so designated.\n \n \n The young men of Bethel mocked Elisha. The Hebrew word qalas means to scoff at, ridicule, or scorn. The term does not suggest innocent conduct. Note the Lord's comment elsewhere: \"...they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and scoffed at his prophets, until the wrath of Jehovah arose against his people, till there was no remedy\" (2 Chron. 36:16).\n Too, the expression, \"Go up...Go up,\" is held by many scholars to reflect the wish of these young men that the prophet go ahead and ascend (as did Elijah - 2 Kgs. 2:11), i.e., leave the earth, that they might be rid of him! Also, the taunt, \"thou bald head,\" was likely a reproach. Old Testament scholar John Whitcomb has suggested that this was an expression \"of extreme contempt. They were pronouncing a divine curse upon him, for which baldness was often the outward sign (cf. Isa. 3:17a, 24)\" (1971, p. 68).\n http://www.christiancourier.com/archives/elishaBear.htm",

But I think if we look at it objectively, abiogenesis is virtually impossible. I think for it to have taken place at all it must have required a designer.

It is easy enough to study something and determine whether ID is likely.\n Take the mount rush more example for instance.

We will (probably) never know either way.\n\n \n I really like that you accept that possiblity of either proposition and I don't want to attribute any ideas to you that you don't posses, but can I ask, is then the probability of abiogenesis as likely as life starting when the giant spaghetti monster crapped upon the Earth whilst cruising through the solar system?",

   "Well I may be wrong here, but many things were different before Christ. You had the laws and sacrifice for example. You have God watching over the lineage of Jesus from what I can tell. You had him protecting his prophets from a murderous gang for example w/ bears.\n\n ummm.... the \"murderous gang\", according to the bible, was a group of children who were making fun of elisha because he was bald (as children often do. elisha, having his feelings hurt, retaliates by summoning 2 bears out of the woods that prompty slash the children to death (2 kings 2: 23-24). and elisha was not in the lineage of jesus\n \n \nIt was an entirely different time and much was different.\n\n and i suppose god is now a better god with fairer principles and is taking a more hands-off approach to the affairs of earth? its the new and improved god, ladies and gentlemen!\n \n \nYou can't possibly know what it is like to have a personal relationship w/Jesus unless you are willing to open yourself up to Him and try it out.

I understand that and patiently accept the mocking, ridiculing etc. because I understand.\n\n i have tried. i was a devout pentecostal christian till only about 2 years ago. in fact, a lot of my spiritual shedding was because of this forum. i know all about trusting in god and finding personal evidence for his existence and intervention in my life. ive spoken in tongues, been baptized, holy-ghost filled, even witnessed to friends who became christians as a result of my life testimony. in school i never did drugs or cursed, i was a virgin until 18. i could explain the bible clearly and i used to teach occassionally in my church youth group\n \n i think i have more knowledge of the bible that the average church goer, and i never had a problem with accepting any part of the bible as true. i even have a deep appreciation of the social and psychological benefits of both the mainstream church system, and the principles found in the bible\n \n my beef is mainly with the illogicality and inconsistency of god himself. god is not a logical guy, by no stretch of the imagination. my problem stems from the fact that i was taught that he was. in the bible, every promise is conditional. do X and god will do Y. it simply does NOT work that way. doing X has absolutely no correlation to recieving Y. no promises are kept. nobody is guaranteed anything will happen, whether good or bad, if they do something. obeying your parents does not guarantee long life. paying tithes does not guarantee \"the windows of heaven being opened, pouring out blessing you cant contain\" (whatever the heck that even is). a nation in prayer does not guarantee the healing of the land. \n \n and whats even worse, in the face of god outright not fullfilling his promises, believers are ready to soothe it over with a \"god works in mysterious ways\" variation, essentially lying to themselves and giving god a scapegoat. the believer starts to question his own faith: \"did i really love god with all my heart?\" \"did i really humble myself enough?\" \"was i believing without doubting?\"; questions that can never be answered, since none of these things can be measured.\n \n after a while, i just got tired of hearing people making excuses for god's unreliability and total disregard. whats the point of believing in a god that shows no sign of being interested in anybody on earth?\n \n believe me, i've been there, to the point where i simply cant even be there anymore.",

The RNA itself could have had simpler precursors, such as peptide nucleic acids (B\u00f6hler et al. 1995).

But we don't have any experience with unembodied designers, and that's clearly what we're dealing with when it comes to design in biology. Actually, if an unembodied designer is responsible for biological complexity, then we do have quite a bit of experience with such a designer through the designed objects (not least ourselves) that confront us all the time. On the other hand, it is true that we possess very little insight at this time into how such a designer acted to bring about the complex biological systems that have emerged over the course of natural history. \n \n ...\n \n It is no objection at all that we don't at this time know how an unembodied designer produced a biological system that exhibits specified complexity. We know that specified complexity is reliably correlated with the effects of intelligence.

I don't analize it, I don't pick it apart, I just accept that we are here and quite comfortably know in my heart that it was by design.\n \n Ultimately, I knew one guy who used to tell me that the earth was 10,000 years old.

I think that many Christians don't look at science because they are afraid of what they might find, but then again, I think the science folks are guilty of the same in reverse. \n \n Science is not a sin. It helps us explain the physical world around us. In fact the more I learn about science the more I find that a creator is the most probable conclusion.\n \n Who told you science is a sin?",

   "As a Canadian, I'm embarassed by Nidder1...\n \n First off, it is not an ad hominem to point out the fallacies in your arguments Nidder. This is what I've seen happen. Saying, for example, that ID is an argument from ignorance which relies on a god-of-the-gaps mindset is not an ad hominem. It's a statement of fact. As has been pointed out to you numerous times in this thread, ID is not science. Rather, it is anti-science. When science comes upon a question to which the answer is \"I don't know\", the procedure is to investigate and come upon the best answer that fits all the available evidence. In other words, an hypothesis is formed, tested, and either discarded or held up as a (temporary) answer. It's a temporary answer because it could always change based on new observations. ID, instead, when presented with a question to which the answer is \"I don't know\", promptly replies with \"God did it!\", and that is the end of that question. Which one furthers our knowledge more? You can see that, as I stated above, ID relies on ignorance. If we knew all the answers, there would be no room for ID. As answers are found, the space where ID can stake a claim gets smaller and smaller. See where \"god-of-the-gaps\" comes into play here?\n \n I've also seen numerous references given to you, links to sites with information which supports the arguments given by the others on this board. These posts are almost immediately followed by you claiming your opponents off no proof to back up their assertions. Those links, those lead to their evidence. By reading them, you are not \"[proving] Trebor's point for him\". Rather, you are actually reading and considering the evidence you have asked him to provide you with. Closing your eyes and plugging your ears does not make your case. Read the links. If you disagree, say why, and offer counterpoints. Just keep in mind that science does not offer \"proof\" of anything. Nothing is definite. I noticed in one of your earlier posts that you were scoffing at a quote offered by one of your opponents because the researcher being quoted said \"could have\". In science, that's as good as it gets. If you're looking for proof, check out a math board.\n \n Also, what makes you think that \"disproving\" abiogenesis in any way, shape or form makes ID the de facto alternative? Not only is that completely illogical, but abiogenesis, as has been pointed out to you numerous times, has absolutely nothing to do with the ToE. I could believe that life began when Barney the purple dinosaur went back in time and sneezed in a particularly rich broth of chemicals, and his cold germs were the first real life on this planet. Doesn't affect the ToE in any way. If you want to believe that God created the first life on this planet, believe away. Still doesn't affect the ToE in any way.\n \n As for your claim that abiogenesis is \"an impossible explanation, that science doesn't back up\", how does the science not back it up? As was already outlined to you by DamEtel, numerous pieces of the puzzle have already been found. There are a few spots where scientists still say \"I don't know\", but we do know more now than we did even five years ago. There aren't many more gaps for your god to fit into when it comes to Life Origins.\n \n \nI've heard a lot of people say over the years including yourself that Christians justify and make leaps of faith where there is no explanation etc. But never have I heard so much of this as in the defense of abiogenesis.\n\n \n I've seen a lot of people ignore what is presented to them on a silver platter, but never anyone as bad as a christian who's faith is threatened. Since you put a personal question of faith to Unkerpaulie, let me ask you a couple: Is your god so frail and impotent that you have to keep him within narrowly confined boundaries? If your faith is so fragile that facts threaten it, don't you think you should examine why that is, rather than declare reality at fault?",

   "Hmm, toby, are you not the one who keeps telling others to \"butt out\"? Strange how you would leap to the defense of Nidder here when no one has addressed you. Especially since one of your major beefs seems to be when people jump into a debate midstream.\n \n \npoisoning his well\n\n What does that even mean in this context?\n \n \ndefining his position\n\n I assume you mean that we are attempting to define his position for him. It seems clear to me he supports ID, so I asked him some pretty straightforward questions:\n \"state why the RNA world hypothesis is not valid (with references, and in your own words ), and what evidence there is to support ID besides \"It's pwetty, so it's designed\" or incredulity.\n \n is each snowflake created by a designer? If not, then how can you tell which items that exhibit design are created by a designer and which \"accidentally fell together no matter how impossible\"?\n \n explain the evidence for ID, how we would test for the presence of ID, and what steps occured in the ID creation of the first life. DamEtel and Trebor have done the same for abiogenesis, so it seems only fair, don't you think?\"\n \n I don't see the problem here.\n \n \nusing ad hominem circumstantial\n\n Hmm, in the span of, what, three posts? he called me confused, illogical, and implied a few others. Where's the ad hominem on my part? Or on Trebor's? As a great man once said \"I do not think that means what you think it means...\"\n \n \ntelling him to read junk\n\n Uh, that junk, what that is, that's called \"reference material\". It's also called \"answers\". See, when a question is asked, an \"answer\" is given. Now, I know it sounds strange, but that's the way it works where I come from. I don't know, maybe I'm just funny that way. See, if someone asks me an answer, and a really smart person who's devoted a lot of time in search of an answer happens to come across one and writes it down, I \"quote\" them. Now, this might also be a strange concept, but bear with me here. By \"quoting\" the person who has done all this research, or by creating a link to their work (you know this practice as posting \"junk\"), you are ensuring that the position is made perfectly clear. That is, there is no chance of misunderstanding the answer, as it is laid out quite clearly.\n \n Put it this way. If I ask you the definition of the word \"alabaster\", you'll probably go to dictionary.com, find the definition, and copy and paste it, right? No, according to you and Nidder, that's completely unnacceptable. I want you to give me the definition of \"alabaster\" in your own words. No quoting, no linking. Just your words. And it better be just as accurate and correct as any dictionary I can find. Pretty ridiculous, isn't it?\n \n \nFace it: \"As a Canadian, I'm embarassed by Nidder1\" serves no purpose except to discredit Nidder1.\n\n Was Nidder insulted by it? Possibly. Is it an ad hominem? No. It was a statement of fact. As a Canadian, I am embarassed that a fellow Canadian is peddling such garbage. That's it, that's all. Besides, he hasn't presented an arguement, so how could I attempt to discredit the non existent by ridiculing him?\n \n \nIf terran et al want Nidder1 to defend something, then for losh sakes they should quote him\n\n I have. Many times. Have you seen a response? Oh, wait, there was this:\n \nThis is a waste of time. You obviously have no interest in taking this seriously and you can read whatever you want into that. Your complete inability to follow logic and stay on point is the only embarrasment I see here. At least for the inbiased observer. Not that there is any chance of finding another one of those here save one.\n\n \n And what set off such a vitriolic response? Why, this:\n \nHere's a thought: answer the questions I and others have put to you, state why the RNA world hypothesis is not valid (with references, and in your own words ), and what evidence there is to support ID besides \"It's pwetty, so it's designed\" or incredulity.\n \n If you can answer those, then I'll answer the questions you put to me. But seeing as how you've been asked these same questions repeatedly for the past, oh, ten pages, it seems only proper that you answer them before we get to anything else.\n\n So, I asked him to clarify his position, and answer a couple questions. Yep, I'd be upset too. And on a debate board yet! I obviously have no shame.\n \n \nHe has no burden to support anything he has no claim to.\n\n He has \"claimed\" that ID is the more reasonable assumption. His burden is to support that assertion. I have yet to see any attempt at doing so. Would you like to try?",

What there is are:\n \n 1) Argument from incredulity.\n \"Gosh, this stuff is complex: I can't imagine how it could come about naturally, therefore, it must be designed.\"\n \n 2) Argument from analogy. \n \"A watch is complex and we know it needs a watchmaker; similarily, a cell is complex, and therefore it too needs a designer.\"\n \n 3) A flawed argument to the best explanation.\n As I pointed out earlier in the thread, actually, the better explanation for the origin of life on Earth is the naturalistic one, since we (a) know organic chemistry exists (but do NOT know that God exists) and we (b) have several of the steps needed to get from inorganic compounds to self-replicating biopolymers confirmed.\n \n You want to talk about evidence for Intelligent Design in biology. Okay:\n \n What actual evidence do you have that the first life was supernaturally created? None. Zip. Zilch.\n \n What actual evidence do you have that the bacterial flagellum, or protein sorting, or the immune system, were designed by a supernatural, unembodied designer? None. Zip.

Why didn't the creator eliminate the problem with back ailments in humans by giving us 4 legs like a centaur? Evolutionists can answer that question by their understanding of developmental restraints. Can creationists come up with a better answer? Why did the creator engineer our digestive & respiratory tracts so we can choke on our food? Evolutionists can answer that question as well, but can you? Why did the creator put the visual cortex of the brain at the back when the eyes are in front, making it easy for lesions to obstruct the optic tracts on their tortuous journey from the eyes to the brain? Evolutionists have a good answer for this one as well, but do you? From the looks of some of these suboptimal designs, you'd think that the designer has a drinking problem, because any good sober engineer wouldn't make these mistakes.",

Suppose some industrial archaeologists are investigating a railroad line. The main line still functions, carrying freight from A to B. But there's this inexplicable little branch line, that peters out after a few metres, going nowhere and delivering nothing. However, alongside the branch line are some toolsheds, just as there are alongside most of the main line.\n \n Archaeologists with a sense of historical change hypothesise that the branch line did in fact once have a function in the processing of freight, but over time this function has been lost and only a remnant of the original structure remains.\n \n A rival faction, who maintain that nothing ever changes, disagree: the little scrap of branch line was obviously built exactly as we see it today, in order that the toolsheds could be placed alongside it.
