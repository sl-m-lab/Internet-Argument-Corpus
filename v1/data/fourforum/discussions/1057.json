You can be arrested without any formal charge being brought against you. This carries no record. Most job applications ask if you have been convicted of a felony. You can say yes or no.

I do this as part of my job. I have done over 400 background checks. They are not required to post anything. It is posted only if the courts chose to do so and the majority do not. As for asking the question about convicting a felony, this does not matter as this is not reliable. I have had people check NO and they had a record. As for the employee taking the time, it takes too much time. It took me 2 solid days contacting several courts to get a disposition on one person, at which time the company decided that we could not spend this much time checking. An applicant can appeal and they have to provide information. Many companies will not bother and the applicant just will not be considered.",

The only time where I have not seen a case disposition is where the case is still being tried in the court system. I am not sure what state in which you reside but in CA the courts are required to fill out a Department of Justice forms providing them with the case disposition on both adult and juveniles cases.",

   "I believe that background checks should be allowed to be conducted by employers. However, the only information that should be given to one's possible employer is that which may pertain to one's duties or any felonious crimes. A felonious crime that occurred should be disclosed to make the employer aware of the employees mentality. An employer should be able to inquire about any possible theft in the potential employees background when their job may consist of handling money or store goods. Yet, I do not agree that a DUI charge is relevant to a retail career. Misdemeanors not pertinent to the job and charges that have been excused or dropped should not be disclosed.",
