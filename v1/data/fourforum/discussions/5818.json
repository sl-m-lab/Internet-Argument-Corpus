Any effect on the EUs dealing with Iran?\n\n \n I feel that it will be bad for relations between the EU and Iran. Being a hardliner, and former Revolutionary Guard member ( meaning a strongly religous person) I believe his believes will interfere with diplomatic relations. Sometimes having a person with strong personal morals is impratical for politics and diplomacy.\n \n I understand that he was elected with strong support from the poorer Iranians, who are actually becoming concerned about the corruption and poor economic situation in Iran. The corruption from some of the clerics and generally from the business class who are not following the religous aspects of Islam.",
