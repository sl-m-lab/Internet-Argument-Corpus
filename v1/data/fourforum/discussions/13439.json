   "October 15th is the big day this week. As I mentioned my dad is going to be arrested for healthcare if my mom doesn't have to work that night. She won't know that until tomorrow. (This was on the thread about the recent arrests in Chicago.)\n \n Health Care Now! is urging everyone to call Congress TODAY because Single Payer is going to be voted on THIS WEEK in the House of Representatives for the first time in history. I called mine but the mailboxes were already filled with other single payer supporters. (So I'm going to call again and again and again if I have to.)\n \n The bill is Rep. Anthony Weiner's amendment which would replace the health insurance reform bill (HR 3200) with the Single-Payer/Medicare for All bill (HR 676). \n \n Rep. Dennis Kucinich (OH) wants to enable states to establish single-payer systems, and got an amendment in HR 3200 that would do so.\n \n Senator Bernie Sanders is introducing S. 703 (Senate single-payer legislation) to the Senate floor for a debate and vote.\n \n Let's make our demands loud and clear by calling Congress now!\n \n We want our Reps. to support Weiner's HR 676 amendment, and retain Kucinich's state single-payer amendment. And we want our Senators to support S. 703.\n \n You can call too @http://tools.advomatic.com/35/hc-n/\n \n Peace and best wishes.",

   "You sound like a very frightened person.\n \n Two thirds of America supports a single payer system. There are many people devoted to this cause. \n \n No matter how many people you throw off forums,\n \n No matter how many people you deny a voice @ Finance Committee Meeting hearings controlled by industry backed corrupt Senators, \n \n No matter how many town meetings you disrupt with obnoxious teabaggers, \n \n No matter how many Americans you arrest at places like CIGNA, \n \n In no matter how many cities across this nation, \n \n Rest assured that single payer will win.\n \n Your nightmare will come true: \n \n Every person in America will have health care. \n \n Like the fight to end segregation, we will win this fight too because righteousness and truth is on our side. While only greed and corruption is on your side. Health care is a human right, not a privilege. No one should be bankrupted because of medical bills. No one should lose their home and wind up on the street because of medical bills. No one should die because they couldn't afford health care. 101,000 Americans every year, gone, due to inadequate care. We need a system that puts patients before profits.\n \n Join the action this Thursday OCT 15th.\n \n Healthcare-NOW! &#8211; Organizing for a National Single-Payer Healthcare System\n \n Mobilization for Health Care for All | Patients not profit! |\n \n Check out the real spirit @http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErKNkeZVCQw&feature=related.

   "Repeated for content: Don't forget to call your reps people and demand that they oppose \"single payer\" unless you want to become slaves to the Federal Government who will then have the power to control your protein intake, monitor your vegetable and fruit consumption and put you on diets when it deems it necessary according to current thinking by the latest generation of social engineers. After all people, if the Feds are in charge of paying for your healthcare, they will also have the right to control your eating habits and calorie intake, not to mention the control of your exercise schedule. Then ask yourself why antonia would promote such a plan unless she was in the pocket of the Feds.\n \n \nThere ya go folks, and here's the number to the House switchboard.
