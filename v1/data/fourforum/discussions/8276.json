Some have the age differntial thing. See: http://www.lewin.com/NR/rdonlyres/ee6c4ee7ynpckrtikzxdngpdfb2gwmiw6twdlzfdy2blv7eqnt2an4yuzgiv5evzclbaiq3lobnr6e/3068overview.pdf page 2. Did the poster even bother to check her States laws? Even so, some states have laws other than rape so it all varies. Your state can be found on page 6 and 7\n \n Oddly enough, the poster lives in Michgan. She can't consent and he can be charged with rape....way to be responsible..she sure is ready for sex emoticon_rolleyes\n \n EDIT: lets go on....if we check out the posters MySpace account we will find that she is lying about her age. She is either 19 as she says on MySpace (although looking at the pictures that is obviously not true) or 14 which is more likely. Responsible? I now know what town she lives in...lucky for her no one on here seems to a child predator from Dateline NBC but talk about leaving yourself open to that.

You will change your mind. Hell, after I had kids, I didn't want to have sex anymore, and I am married and fiancially secure. You hear jokes abotu married people not having sex anymore. It is my understanding that it is actually people who have children who experience a drop off in their sex drives. I firmly believe that this is becuase you have reminders EVERY DAY that there can be CONSEQUENCES to that kind of thing. \n \n If staying with the kids for a week doesn't convince you, my wife is due to have our third next month. That is an overall yucky experience. Trust me, you don't want to do it any tiem soon.\n \n Protection? Our first was brought to us by the fine folks at Trojan. Our second was apparently a failure in the quality control section of the plant that produces the pill. The one that is due next month is a catastrophic failure of the patch. \n \n Even if you have an abortion, that is more than you want to deal with. Trust me.\n \n Don't get me wrong. I love my kids.

Basically, I think I like them best when they are asleep. When they sleep, they are cute, and quiet, and they like to cuddle up next to you and take naps. \n \n There is no rush. You will have plenty of time later to have sex as much as you want with as many people as you want. That is what college is for emoticon_xgood \n \n I just polled my wife on this.

Odds are you won't.\n But hopefully you'll at least think about it.\n \n Hopefully you'll be able to differentiate inbetween the ones who have been calling a 14-year old \"stupid\" and the ones who are trying to prevent you from having something pop up that will alter your life irrevocably.\n \n \n \ni'm going to Cancun with my friends tomorrow, then i fly to the hamptons, then onto NC until the end of july.\n\n Sounds like a lot of fun.\n Enjoy yourself and stay safe.",

That's a pain and a struggle that I have never and likely will never have to experience.\n Also, before you said anything, I guessed that this was the case. If you need to know that you can trust your boyfriend, having sex with him will, at best, tell you absolutely nothing and at worst, tell you that you can't trust him. When it comes to sex and trust, knowing he is willing to wait is the best gauge of his trust.\n\n \n haha, I typed up a response that almost sounded exactly like the second half of your post.\n \n Like Master_Shake, sex is not trust and not even in the same family...if it were then you have about 75% of the guys at your high school willing to show they trust you. \n \n It seems amazing that the overwhelming majority thinks you are wrong yet you still believe you are in the right.

Sometimes I would like to think I wasn't \"that way\" when I was 14 but I know I was. \n \n As for you Marisa, I've probably been a little harsh on you and I apologize but it is rather frustrating to see the same mistakes I made being made by others (well...maybe not exactly the same mistkaes but same line of thinking). You will look back one day and say \"dang, those guys were right\" just as everyone since the beginning of time has.\n\n \n \n I think every parent has that problem. They don't want their kid to learn the hard way, and try to just tell them everything. But their parents tried that too. Sometimes the best way for someone to learn is to learn it the hard way. The job of parents is to make sure they don't kill themselves while doing it. Back on the topic of sex, as you've seen, there are some kids who will have sex regardless. And if this is just hormonal lust and will be looked back on as a bad idea, at least she will have that experience. The most we can do is give advice and leave it up to her to either follow it or not. After all, what are you going to do? Reach through the computer and stop her? Most parents have a hard enough time.\n \n Also on the topic, as long as you use protection with a low risk of having an STD (and if they've been dating since he was just barely 14, I doubt he was having sex before that), there is next to no chance of getting an STD or getting pregnent. If I remember, the one thing they did teach us in sex ed was that when condoms are used right, their effectiveness is over 99%. Obviously the only 100% way is to not have sex, but that's the same for kids and adults, and the percentage of adults that don't have sex ever is extremely low, which is a good thing or else the human race would die out. I still have a hard time with the fact that almost everyone has sex, yet it is considered the worst thing ever on TV and such (the word f*** used as a verb for sex can earn a movie an R rating), while violence is considered everyday. Turn on the news, anyone can see bombs going off, but show a nipple on public TV? I think that got a $500,000 fine.",

   "Secondly, I'm far from an old fogie, and no, not every teenager is out drinking, doing drugs, or having sex. You're hanging out in the wrong circles if you think that is the case. I'm sure Zachvac would agree if he were here. He's in high school, ask him.\n \n\n \n \n Yes kids in high school dring. Yes they do drugs. Yes they have sex (it's not uncommon to find a condom in the bathroom). But as pointed out here, there are plenty of kids who don't do it. Now I also know that as a baseball player, drugs and alcohol are more prevelant among athletes. If I had to guess, I'd say maybe 3 out of 18 (including me) kids on the team don't drink. There are at least 8 kids who I know drink. I think the percentage of kids who do drugs is lower, but there are kids who do drugs as well. I really have no idea about the actual percentage of kids who have sex because not many people tell me about when they have sex (thankfully :)). But that's why I don't spend most of my free time with kids on the baseball team. I see them in the hall and we talk and stuff. But they know that I'm not into that stuff, and they respect that. It is possible to be an athlete and not drink or do drugs. And at least here if you're caught doing drugs or alcohol first offense is a one-year suspension. Second is permenent ban. So I also know that at least during the school season, no one drinks at least at parties. I don't know what they're doing at their house, but thankfully they put baseball, at least for the season, above drinking and drugs. Of course the other day at our summer practice I heard about some people who got mugged on their way home at 3am and I'm glad I've made the choice not to do that kind of thing (not to mention my parents would probably have a problem with me coming home at 3am).\n \n But the original poster here seems responsible. If I'm not mistaken she has stayed clear of drugs and alcohol, and has been together for over 2 years. I don't see what's so bad about sex. As long as both people consent, and they use protection, there's a pretty low risk of anything bad happening. And especially if she's talked to her mom about it, she seems very mature about it.",

Brighton 9 months ago and we wouldnt go near ANYONE. not even our boyfriends. it was scary as hell. so doing this was a big step for me. it was a HUGE step. and i'm glad i took it. just because one person takes advantage doesnt mean every guy does. right? right steve, eric? \n \n so, if any of you have daughters -or- sons. keep them close. it was scary as hell and i'm sure that none of you had to experience that pain and that fear that young. none of you! so stop acting as if i'm just experimenting or just trying to act out. i needed to know if i could trust my boyfriend. we're still dating. we still love eachother. and this is farther than i thought i'd be 6 months ago. so stop acting like i know nothing and like i havent been through anything! its annoying and its wrong!emoticon_mad\nI didn't have to keep my daughters, or son, close to me because they damned well had some street moxie and knew better.\n \n Why are American parents bringing their kids up to be so frigging naive?",

I know I didn't.\n\n Gee Steeeeve, let's go to the instant replay, shall we?\n \n Your VERY FIRST REPLY to her...\n (Emphasis mine...)\n \nFor someone that said they are a \"mature\" 14yr old, you sure are doing a lot of dumb things. \n It is stupid to have sex at 14 and thats probably a good reason why it should be illegal. 14yr olds are careless and irresponsible.\n\n \n So there, you threw the words \"dumb\", \"stupid\", \"careless\", and \"irresponsible\" at her.\n \n Your very next reply to her...\n \nI think we can easily establish that this is a dumb act...in fact it is down right idiotic.\n\n \n And the next one...\n \nbut don't tell us what to not call you or say to you, you asked and we are telling you that it is stupid and irresponsible. We are right, you are not.\n\n \n \n Go ahead. Give me your excuse.\n I'll adopt the same rationale in dealing with you, and we'll see how long you can last without complaining when I put \"stupid\" in every post to you, with whatever \"phrasing\" you think excuses the usage.\n \n Let's hear it...\n \n \n \nThere was no mistake though. She wasn't looking for advice and I think we all know that. She wanted to start up a bad topic and this is what happens ;). \n\n Bullspit Steeeeve.\n She was looking for advice.\n She may not have been going to take it, but she WAS looking for advice.\n \n \n \nMy kids wouldn't have to have to ask the question on a forum if that is your question.\n\n No, that's not my question at all.\n But your response was entirely what I expected.\n Your kids won't even talk to you about it because your mentality HAS ALREADY SHUT THEM OUT.\n \n \n \nIn the event they ask me person to person, then I would have the same advice protrayed in a different way. Like she said though, she is not my responsibility so I'll be a little harsh since it didn't matter anyway.\n\n She's a 14-year old girl who was recently raped, but she's not your responsibility so it's okay for you to be \"a little harsh\"?\n Is that what I'm getting here?\n :xbanghead \n \n \n \nLike I said, when you want to only hear a certain answer then you leave yourself open to getting told off ;). I don't have much patience for things like that.\n\n Then don't respond.\n What's the phrase? If you can't say anything nice?\n \n Or maybe the solution is that you LEARN some patience.\n Isn't patience a virtue?\n Or is that not a Christian virtue?\n \n \n \nI don't think this is acting like a teenager. As some other said, not all teenagers act like this.\n\n \"Not all\", but a whole hell of a lot.\n Polls show that about half of all teen-agers have sex.\n And they sure as hell aren't going to listen to somebody on the internet who tells them that their actions are \"stupid\"...\n \n I'm curious.\n Is it only 14-year old girls who have been raped that you throw the \"stupid\" word at?\n Or are there other posters on these message boards that you use this type of \"reasoning\" with as well?",

I will not inflame the hormones of adolescents by enlarging upon the physical contact in culturally sanctioned areas of the body, the hormone-inflamed adolescents can use their active imaginations--I hope they have active imaginations but if you just sit on a damned couch and watch TV all day or just play video games, your brain is fried.\n \n When one has gained a bit of experience, one may wish to indulge in the zipless ****, I've never engaged in this sort of activity and I am puzzled that it seems to be quite attractive to a few. Hopefully, one has the reading skills to pour through Erica Jong's book of the same title, I presume that it can be quite illuminating, as well as being funny. Excuse me, the title of the book is Fear of Flying. Improve your reading skills, dear little unfinished and raw adolescents, and illuminate thyselves.\n \n End of today's lecture.\n\n Hay, I sit on the damned couch and watch TV all day or just play video games and I can think circles out of a wet paper bag, so watch it baby, your messing with my people.",

You're already way ahead of any of them for the fact that you talk to your mom about this stuff. \n \n Personally I don't think I was was ready for a serious relationship until I was about 26 (not that that stopped me from doing it plenty anyways, or even from being married for five years and having a kid) but I will readily admit I'm abnormal. emoticon_xgood \n \n One thing I can tell you from my experience is that the emotions you feel right now are probably about as intense as they will ever be. It's weird how vitally important dating stuff seemed back in high school, and now that it actually *is* really important I'm just kind of apathetic about it. Other friends my age have substantiated this experience, so I don't *think* it's just because of the medication. Breaking up with my first boyfriend in high school was a big nasty mess. I'm talking restraining orders, screaming, crying for months on end, stalking, being begged for forgiveness and to please be taken back... On the other hand when I broke the news to my ex husband that I was leaving him there was about three days of melodrama before we were both pretty much over it. We get along pretty well now, except for the fact that he's an idiot. :xbanghead Um, so I guess what I'm trying to say is to enjoy the strong emotions, because the good ones are just as strong as the bad ones, and the older you get the more boring your relationships are.

Everything worked out well in the end, and he got arrested.\n \n And im really sorry to hear that you were raped. Those kind of scumbags deserve to be shot with a big weapon, maybe a 28 gauge, although it gets a little messy.\n \n And what you're going through is defonitaly hormonal lust. Ive seen my sister go throught it. You may not know it, but it defonitaly is. I love paintballing too, but i dont smoke while paintballin. I dont smoke, dont drink, and dont have sex. I also maintain a 4.0 GPA. You think im a nerd, not really. Im probably in one of the coolest groups in the school, and i have dated at 12.\n \n \n AND AlSO, let me add, that i personally think that some of the adults behavior on this forum is discraceful. I dont mean to personal attack, but you guys are really acting immature, and are coming close to personal attacks yourself. I would think you would try to set an example, but ive seen 12 year olds act more mature than you guys. Chill out, and offer some useful advice, not personal attacks, and not calling them \"stupid\".",

   "I personally believe that it is not a straightforward answer that sex at fourteen is right or wrong. It is much more complicated than that.\n \n On one hand, you can say that sex is ok at the age fourteen if the person is physically, mentally, emotionally and please note FISCALLY ready for it. It is like this, you must be able to stand the consequences of your own actions, whether it may be good or bad, by yourself. You should not have others like parents or siblings suffering for your actions as well. If this is the result then, you were not ready to indulge. So if you are a 14 year old and you meet these prerequisites, then you might be ready for it.\n \n To argue along these lines will make a case for sex education starting at probably age ten or eleven, you know at that junction between childhood and puberty. I do not believe that the formal education system should leave such an important part of development to just the family because chances are that it never occurs there. Religious entities must also gain enough maturity to enable such education to take place in our schools. It is important when we consider that factors such as technology, STIs and the fact that there are many persons out there whose mental capacity would make young persons sexual prey.\n \n I also believe that we must not come out exclusively and say that all sex at age fourteen is wrong. We are the same societies who value the love of Romeo and Juliet. Juliet was 14 years old when she married and became intimate with Romeo. Do we ever hear anyone who is learned in the field of Literature or other arts coming out and saying that there was something wrong with Juliet? That she was in a fit of hormonal chaos? No, we do not; we hear instead that Juliet was mature compared to Romeo (an older person) and that the love they shared was pure. So we cannot say that one is to ready for sex at age fourteen.\n And I am sure that someone would want to come out and say that Romeo and Juliet were not real, but I present to you that whether or not they were real is not the issue as the tale represents a state of human thought and intellect. So we cannot dismiss the fact that there may be those who at age 14 who will be ready for sex.\n \n I also wish to draw to the readers' attention that in many parts of the world, there are laws which permit marriage at age fourteen, and consequently sex at this age as well. So there must be some reasoning behind it all depending on the culture of that people or circumstances. So the issue of age and sex also has a cultural twist.\n \n But the issue of age and sex as I said initially is not a straightforward right or wrong. We have to consider that in our world today, your young people are not safe. There are many sexual predators out there who may even prey on babies. At age fourteen, one may not even be safe. They are still vulnerable. Yes they might have the understanding that the person is taking advantage of them, but circumstances, both individual and social may permit these persons to continue to be victims of sex crimes. So as a society, we have to ensure that there are measures in place to prevent such things from happening. There might be laws, such as those adults to have sex with persons who are minors, that is to say below eighteen years old. But does that stop a number of teenage pregnancies in which the father is an adult? No.\n As societies, if we are determined to protect our young people form sexual consequences, we must create a society that would promote healthy sexual habits, not one that condemns sex at fourteen as being right or wrong and chooses to praise or ignore it. Because the reality is that it is going to happen no matter how much you preach against it. \n \n My suggestions is that we implement laws that seek to protect our children form sexual predators out there, determine if a person met the prerequisite requirements for having sex, which I have suggested before punishment AND NOTE THIS, create an environment where young people would engage in fruitful activities instead of sex because they are bored.\n \n So, once more, I reiterate that sex at fourteen is not fully right or fully wrong, but relative. We have to recognize this if we wish to lover the adverse effects of sex at such an age.\n \n Happy Holidays!:)",

Due to evolution, children were meant to have sex after they hit puberty, and nature is driving them to do so, therefore it is not right or wrong, moral or immoral to have sex at a young age. It was evolution's intention. However, the question we should be asking is whether this is benefit or harm the participants, which is different than the moral or immoral issue.",

   "Steeeve , actually her myspace is invalid I can't look at it. To check what you say. And alot of people lie on myspace, I mean alot alot. PRETTY MUCH anyone under 18, alot of my friends have it and they say they are older like from 13 to 17 or 12 to 999 or 14 or 15 or 16 to in their nineties or twenties. Most people do it do conceal their real age and noone really believes what people state as age though\n \n And Nocturnal , while its offtopic the fact that Steeeve could even view your myspace shows a lack of judgement. THAT TO ME is creepy that a complete stranger, no offense to steeve meant, can look at your webpage. If you wanted to be safe your myspace should be private..\n \n Have you thought about what happens if you get pregnant? \n You should if you are going to do this. I don't feel I can judge you because I am not in your position but I am also a teen, turning 14 semi soon and personally my view take on it is that I don't plan on sex at least till i turn 18 because if you get pregnant at least when you are 18 the state legally considers you an adult, and the state is more likely to believe you are more than a messed up american nightmare girl who got pregnant because she couldnt be safe. (generally, meant, no implication to you yourself at all. I would rather wait till I turn 18 so I have some legal status , as I dont as a minor. \n \n But you should look into what you will do if you get pregnant. If you are mature you will do what it takes to be careful. I would also check up on the rape laws in your state just to make sure your best friend\\boyfriend won't get charged with rape, also you should make sure that its safe. GO TO A pharamacy and get the nesscary means so you won't get pregnant. \n \n See if your boyfriend will wait though.\n \n It is gonna have to depend what you think. Maybe you should talk to someone who knows you though like a friend you trust , preferably someone a bit older than you or your boyfriend so they can give you advice.",

Regardless of genetics, it is wrong on that level by definition. Legal means right and illeagal means wrong. Right comes from the word \"righteous\" (not meaning to use a religious term here just giving the word origin). It is an old greek term that was used in an ancient legal system. That is the manner in which I am using the terms right and wrong. I do not specifically refer to a \"moral system\" but rather a system of laws.\n \n Huck",

   "However, I've never met a boy named Sue.\n \n Neither have I nor a boy named eve or katie?\n \n \n Noctornal, I am really sorry you got raped. Wow, I cannot even immagine at all how traumatizing that must be. The scum should get punished were they ever caught? Kudos to you that you can be ok and confident sharing that you were raped. its also good that you asked for advice, that I THINK shows maturity. And steeve was to harsh I think to you. You seem to be doing a pretty good job ignoring his snide remarks and such though. \n \n I know you used protection and I don't mean to seem like naggy, but and I know its not my responsibility and I m not in charge but have you seriously considered if the protection broke or failed, what you would do if you got pregnant?\n \n All I think mainly is you should talk to your boyfriend and if theres no chance the law will get him in trouble with rape , and just talk over what you would do if by some chance you got pregnant. \n \n \n ANd it isnt fair for people to deman the relationships of teens. Maybe they arent \"real\" whatever that means or maybe its not more than childish impules but what we feel is real to us, and so what if it isnt real love. It is to us and thats what matters. I mean I think its not trivial if I or my friends really like someone, and as long as I am not getting pregnant or acting bad I don't see anything against how I feel.",

Two 11-year-old girls, a 12-year-old boy and a 13-year old boy were charged with obscenity, a felony. An 11-year-old boy, the alleged lookout, was charged with being an accessory.\n \n \"After 44 years of doing this work, nothing shocks me anymore,\" said Union Parish Sheriff Bob Buckley. \"But this comes pretty close.\"\n \n Authorities said the incident happened March 27 at the school, which houses students from kindergarten through 12th grade. A high school teacher normally watches the fifth-grade class at the time, but went to an assembly for older students and the class was inadvertently left unattended, Buckley said. (Watch authorities try to determine if a crime was committed Video)\n \n The class, which had around 10 other students, was alone for about 15 minutes, he said.\n \n \"When no teacher showed up, the four began to have sex in the classroom with the other elementary students in the classroom with them,\" he said.\n \n",
