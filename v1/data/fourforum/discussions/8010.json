   "Not all Christians are as blinkered as the muppets we encounter here, it's a shame they don't make their point more forcefully to the majority. \n \n \nClergy voice their support for evolutionary theory\n 01 April 2006 \n From New Scientist Print Edition. \n \n THEY are going to hell, and have been described as \"Christian whores, atheists and worse\". What could be worse is hard to imagine, but such are the epithets being hurled by fundamentalist Christians at thousands of Christian clergy who have declared themselves comfortable with both religion and evolution.\n \n More than 10,000 clergy have signed up to the \"Clergy Letter Project\", launched in 2004 by Michael Zimmerman of the University of Wisconsin in Oshkosh. \"Evolution Sunday\", held in February to discuss the compatibility of science and religion, is planned to become a yearly event at churches across the US, Zimmerman says.\n \n \"For the first time in America, thousands of Christian clergy are standing up and making it clear that the Christian fundamentalists who are shrilly screaming about the evils of evolution are not speaking for them,\" he says. \"I'm hoping this demonstrates to a broader swathe of the public just how intolerant the fundamentalists really are.\"\n \n \"I'm hoping this demonstrates just how intolerant Christian fundamentalists really are\"\"The Clergy Letter Project demolishes any claim that the struggles over evolution in the US are a matter of science and religion in conflict,\" says Kenneth Miller of Brown University, Rhode Island. Miller was the lead witness for the group of parents who last year successfully took the school board in Dover, Pennsylvania, to court to stop the teaching of \"intelligent design\" in science classes.\n",

Living in the UK means that I don't have a lot of the problems that you guys do (though i have traveled in the US Bible belt), but given that many of the religious people (both pulpit and congregation) I know in this country accept evolution (albiet with a wry grin sometimes), why can't these people leave others alone to find their own path? \n \n Why cant they accept that maybe 'God works in mysterious ways, His wonders to perform.'
