   "Just found this story today: US Arming Sunnis in Iraq against Al Qaeda.\n \n I thougt of putting this in the \"historical ignorance\" thread because it certainly fits, but I didn't want to hijack it.\n \n I really wonder about our nation when I hear things like this. I have to wonder if they know anything about history at all. Not just the fact that plans like this have failed in the past, to quote the article: \nProviding weapons to breakaway rebel groups is not new in counterinsurgency warfare, and that in places where it has been tried before, including the French colonial war in Algeria, the British-led fight against insurgents in Malaya in the early 1950s, and in Vietnam, the effort often backfired, with weapons given to the rebels being turned against the forces providing them. \n\n The officers say they \"acknowledge\" it, but apparently they do not learn from it at all.\n \n Beyond those cases, do these people completely forget that the US had a strong hand in funding the very person who began Al Qaeda, something that we are paying for still, in 9/11, and in the \"wars\" today? \n \n I see nothing but bad coming from this plan - I see nothing but a future enemy terrorist organisation, and another 9/11 years in the future.",

   "Basically the US is arming the same Muslim groups that are responsible for 75% of the attacks on US soldiers. Smart move.\n \n Not to mention the blowback that will come from this.\n \n The ignorance of the US government is beyond belief.",

   "This is a genus move by the Bush admin.\n \n Once a withdrawal is forced by limp wristed libby's the region will implode into more violence as the Sunnis we arm fight each other, Al Qaeda and the Shiites...and all other ethinic groups...I mean the list is long.\n \n More than likely it'll devolve into another back water Afghanistan rife with civil wars, hopefully drawing in all surrounding nations (Turkey for fighting the Kurds, Iran for the fighting the Sunni's, Saudi Arabia for fighting the Shiites, Syria...everyone man.\n \n Then Bushy can sit back and proudly twist this to be \"Well this is exactly what the Dem's wanted as well as the mass media...some gimpy cluster #### that makes good press and something people can shake their heads over.\n \n Of course, everytime he'll make such comments, he'll repeatedly look at his watch and the ceiling.\n If asked, he'll say something brilliant like, \"Jebus is due any minute now.\"\n \n Besides, if the area melts down, it'll be years before we have another 911 like event.\n By that time, most people will have forgotten most major points and all minor points of todays current event. Then they'll have a half dozen talking heads on the news shows stating \"we shoulda nuked 'em good.\"\n \n \n I mean guys, you can't defeat terrorism, all you can do is try to dictate the fighting grounds and hope your 'enemies' fight your 'enemies' for you.",
