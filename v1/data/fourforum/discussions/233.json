   "Some Major Blunders Have been made.\n \n Many of you may remember some of the events surrounding the missing hard drives at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Los Alamos has long been one of the world's most notorious outfits for nuclear research and development. Some of you might recognize the name Hanson, as he became the poster boy for high level espionage in the 21st century. Most thinking Americans were outraged at the slap on the wrist that Wen Ho Le received for his activities. Do any of you remember hearing stories about Mr. Deutch, head of the CIA from 1995-1996?\n \n Apparently, Mr. Deutch took classified information home with him and stored high level documents on the hard drive of his home computer. To make matters worse, his home computer was linked to the internet at that time. Anybody who is familiar with online vulnerabilities can attest to the stupidity of such an act. Furthermore, the head of the CIA should be well versed in the capabilities of computer hackers and foreign spies. Of couse, any agent of the government has a higher probablility of having his home lines tapped into by foreign intelligence, but the director of the CIA should expect it. One must ask whether or not this stupidity was deliberate, especially now, after the Hansen case was so widely publicized. If Russian diplomats are able to bug State Department offices, one can only assume they have the assets available to compromise a civilian's home security.\n \n Stories like this became more prevalent during the era of the Clintonistas. High level security breeches have become commonplace. Even more alarming is the government's unwillingness to prosecute these crimes to the fullest extent of the law. If nobody pays for gross imcompetence, or even deliberate misconduct regarding our nation's national security, one can only expect further violations. I remember reading about low level spies that were killed for lesser offenses during the cold war. \n \n We have already seen the trickle down effect that the Los Alamos incident has caused regarding nuclear proliferation in the world, for it is no coincidence that China's ability to target any one of our American cities correlates to abuses in handling classified information. Such destructive technology is demonstrating a trickle down effect, as Chinas has sold its older technologies to irresponsible parties, like Pakistan, North Korea, and possibly Iran. As a result, the United States finds itself in a position where it must face the long term effects of such negligence for years to come. What kind of results must we endure before we once again decide to get tough on crimes of espionage? What should the penalty be for espionage, and/or negligence in handling classified information?",

The government may had a clear cut case for treason, but they dropped the ball. It is now unclear what really happened. It is pretty clear the Chinese sciencentist mishandled classified information, but did he intentionally leak it? Was there a conspiracy to commit treason? I am sure that he did something stupid and was made the scapegoat. He broke the first rule of working for the government, the CYA rule, Cover Your AS*. Alot of other people got away scott free who did CYA.",

If I had to say one or the other, I would say Newton, for he laid most of the groundwork for modern physics and mathematics. Without his incite, differential equations wouldn't have been spawned by calculus, and schrodinger would have had nothing to work with.

   "I am sorry, it was Heisenburg who was the Nazi. I retract that statement. It seems my memory failed me, and I made an erroneous statement regarding Schodinger's political affiliation. Please excuse this blunder.\n \n \"In 1927 Schr\u00f6dinger was offered the extremely prestigious job of replacing Max Planck when he retired from the University of Berlin. Schr\u00f6dinger hated to leave the Alps for the crowded city, but he accepted. It turned out to be a wonderful teaching and learning period for Schr\u00f6dinger, but one brought to a nasty close by the rise of the Nazi party in Germany. He saw many esteemed colleagues hounded from their jobs and forced to leave the country. He also chose to leave in 1933, the year Hitler became Germany's chancellor. He went to Oxford University and in his first week there learned that he'd won the Nobel Prize with Paul Dirac.\" - Source:PBS\n \n It was Heisenberg that headed up the German atomic bomb program. Although many attempts are being made to clear his name, it is clear that people are speculating as to his actual motives. Some site a meeting between Heisenburg and his Jewish friend Nils Bohr as evidence that he was no Nazi. They speculate that he was in fact sabotaging the Nazi weapons program. These claims are a matter of conjecture. What we must deal in are facts. We must look at the fact that he stayed in Germany while other notorious scientists left. We must look at the fact that he was a Nazi until allied forces captured the German scientists who were trying to create nuclear weapons. Heisenberg deserves the Nazi label. That much is apparent by the lack of explanation he gave surrounding his time as Adolf's hand picked nuclear scientist. His silence speaks volumes.\n \n I read about Heisenburg in my Physical Chemistry Text book, and unfairly attributed his nazism to Schrodinger, who had a side note of his own in the book. Again, I apologize for this blunder, and will try to refrain from such mistakes in the future.",
