   "Question: What's the one piece of evidence that nearly all Darwinists resort to when backed up against a wall about the validity of ToE?\n \n Answer: the vitamin C pseudogene \n \n \n Evolutionists are simply brilliant at deceiving people. For a long time they deceived me too....but after conversing with them day in and day out, I began to learn how their minds work and how to quickly spot their deceptions. Now, with much practice, exposing evolutionists' tricks has become second nature. It is so clear to me now that every piece of \"evidence\" that they have ever presented is the result of deception at one level or another. \n \n One of the greatest examples of deception is the use of the Vitamin C (or gulo gene) as \"evidence\" for common descent. However, I am going to show that this is not evidence in any way, shape or form of common descent. Towards the end of this post, it will become perfectly clear exactly how these people are using a sleight-of-hand to deceive people....it will also become perfectly clear why primates and humans both have this defective gene.\n \n The basic problem here is that evolutionists have ASSUMED that genes (and gene states) occur in different animals because of the result of evolution. In other words since humans and other primates share the same defective gene, then that must mean we are all related to some mysterious ancestor in the past. In their minds there is no way that this defective gene could have appeared independently in humans and other primates without common descent being involved. And the reason for this is they ASSUME that genetic mutations are random. But, there's another side to the story....read on:\n \n I believe that God made each creature with the ability to adapt to different environments. This environmental adaptation has nothing what-so-ever to do with evolving into another kind of creature. Change over time is merely a tool that allows organisms to keep from going extinct. It's this genomic plasticity that helps ensure their survival.\n \n Ok. so instead of looking at this from the evolutionists' standpoint, let's look at this from a different angle. Let's put ourselves in the Garden of Eden. We see Adam and Eve consuming all kinds of fruits and vegetables. In fact, at first that's probably all they ate, since that's what was given to them, (as reported in Genesis.) Going from that point forward, it's pretty easy to imagine that the earth was filled with fruit trees, wild vines with berries, and a human population that was intelligent enough to engage in agriculture.\n \n So with that, it's also pretty easy to imagine that there was no NEED for the human genome to mutate to accommodate a fruitless/vitaminC-less diet. Likewise, we also know that primates also consume a diet high in fruits, leaves and berries, thereby getting plenty of vitamin C. So like humans, primates would have no reason for their genomes to mutate if they ate fruits and leaves high in vitamin C from the beginning.\n \n So at this point we have humans and other primates both consuming diets high in vitamin C, and both containing \"defective\" genomes that are unmutated. This is simply the result of eating fruits from the onset of creation, thus not requiring a mutation to create vitamin C internally.\n \n So what about all the other mammals? Why is it that they are able to create their own vitamin C? Well let's think about it. Look at cows, horses, buffalo, deer, and other grazing animals.....none of them consume fruit...they all consume mainly grasses. Look at bears. They may eat some fruit, but their diet mostly requires a high intake of fats, which means fish and whatever other kinds of animals they can kill. Rodents may also consume some berries, but probably mostly seeds and nuts. Other mammals such as cats and dogs eat mostly meat. No fruits, no berries, little -- if any -- vitamin C.\n \n The point that I'm making here is that there are not too many other mammals whose diets are high in vitamin C. So, what must have happened at some point was that their genomes mutated to accommodate this vitamin C-less diet. I believe every animal was probably initally created to be vegetarians, and at some point after the Fall, any animal populations that did not consume a regular diet high in vitamin C experienced a mutation so that it could be produced internally.\n \n There are actually other animals, though, such as the guinea pig and the fruit bat who, like humans require vitamin C and are unable to produce it internally. In my mind, this simply means that they've always eaten fruits or diets high in vitamin C, thus their genomes have not needed to mutate to accommodate a diet low in Vitamin C! (Is this stuff not just obvious common sense?)\n \n So at the beginning I promised you that I would expose the slight-of-hand evolutionists are using. It's simply this: when they present the argument that the inability to produce vitamin C proves common descent, they are doing so under the guise that this genetic mutation (or lack of it) is a MISTAKE! The reality is, there is no \"mistake.\" It is simply an unmutated gene that remains unmutated because there was no need for a mutation. Since humans and primates consume a diet high in fruits, the genome has no need to change.\n \n And all this would be very easy to test. All evolutionary science would have to do is take some guinea pigs (or fruit bats), isolate them from fruits and other sources of vitamin C for a few generations, let them breed and see if the future generations mutate! There is, of course, no guarantee that a mutation would ensure survival, but it would be interesting to see if a mutation indeed happened. But have there been any such tests? Of course not! Why? Because evolutionary science is not interested in the truth. They could care less about real science and they could care less if mutations are random or nonrandom as long as the population believes we share a common ancestor with a chimp.\n \n As you can see, though, this Vitamin C thing absolutely does not prove common descent. There is a perfectly rational explanation as to why humans and primate genomes have not mutated like other mammals' have.\n \n On the link below you will see that this Gulo gene happens to be in an area in the genome that is more likely to mutate, called a hotspot. Hotspots, being more likely than others to mutate, indicates just what I said earlier: that organisms were set up to be adaptive to different environments.",

   "http://www.iscid.org/papers/Borger_SharedMutations_061506.pdf\n \n The extraordinary evidence: the GULO gene\n \n I have always had a fascination for the GULO gene. The GULO gene specifies the protein\n gulono-lactono-oxidase that catalyses the final step in the biosynthesis of ascorbic acid -\n vitamin C. With a few exceptions, all animal species are able to synthesize vitamin C.\n Those who do not produce it require a regular dietary intake, otherwise they will develop\n scurvy. Humans do not synthesize vitamin C. In fact, all the families tested from one\n suborder of primates - the Platyrrhini - also lack the ability to make their own vitamin C,\n whereas those from the other suborder - the Catarrhini - make the vitamin in the liver.\n Humans and the great apes are not the only organisms lacking the ability to synthesize\n 9\n vitamin C, however. All tested species of bats (Chiroptera) are deficient in producing\n vitamin C [Birney et al, 1976]. Another example is the guinea pig, which appears to be\n the only non-producer among the rodents. Degenerative loss of vitamin C biosynthesis\n has evidently occurred quite frequently1. The study of GULO pseudogene sequences may\n be informative to reveal whether mutations are a non-random phenomenon, since - due to\n lack of purifying selection - mutations easily accumulate in pseudogenes.\n In 1999, Japanese scientists at Wakayama Medical University determined the exact DNA\n sequences of the GULO pseudogenes of humans, the great apes and the macaque, and\n compared their data to the active gene found in the rat [Ohta & Nishikimi, 1999]. The\n sequences they reported show that the pseudogenes of the great apes are almost identical,\n but differ on several positions to that of the rat's active gene. As shown in figure 2,\n comparing the sequences of human, chimpanzee, gorilla and orangutan reveals a single\n nucleotide deletion at position 97 in the coding region of exon X in all primates. If the\n genes had been active genes, the deletion would have caused a frame shift and inactivated\n the gene. It is this shared mutation that is often presented as molecular evidence that\n proofs common decent of the Platyrrhini. The mutations in the GULO pseudogene could\n indeed provide such evidence, but then non-random mutations that create the illusion of\n common descent must be excluded.\n In 2003, the same Japanese group published the complete sequence of the guinea pig\n GULO pseudogene and compared it to that of humans [Inai et al, 2003]. They reported a\n 1 An intriguing question is - why would an inactivated GULO pseudogene be fixed in a common ancestor?\n Darwinians must propose the inactivation of the gene provided a selective advantage.\n 10\n large number of shared mutations (substitutions) present in both organisms. Under the\n assumption of an equal chance of substitution throughout the sequence, the probability of\n the same substitutions in both humans and guinea pigs occurring at the observed number\n of positions and more was calculated to be 1.84x10-12. This extreme small probability\n indicates the presence of many mutational hot spots in the sequences [Inai et al, 2003].\n Remarkably, the mutational hot spots found in guinea pigs and humans exactly match the\n mutations that set humans and primates apart from the rat. The GULO sequences\n presented in [Ohta & Nishikimi, 1999] and [Inai et al, 2003] are combined in figure 2. It\n shows that 11 out of 21 positions of exon X are shared and line up as the result of\n mutational hot spots - that is more than 50 percent. Even the single nucleotide deletion at\n position 97 is a non-random position. If non-random mutations make up 50-70 percent of\n the mutations in a DNA sequence they would have dramatic consequences for the\n molecular evidence of common descent; 50 percent is approximately the part of\n mutations shared between humans and chimpanzees sequences that are usually\n interpreted as the result of common descent2.",

   "OK Talk origins has the following to say. Lets see if its in the context you indicated.\n \n First of all its used as evidence of macro evolution NOT common descent across the board as you implied. Secondly its a vestigial character because the gene is inactivated by a deletion or frameshift thus either stopping expression or resulting in a defective inactive enzyme.\n \n \nPrediction 2.3: Molecular vestigial characters\n \n Vestigial characters should also be found at the molecular level. Humans do not have the capability to synthesize ascorbic acid (otherwise known as Vitamin C), and the unfortunate consequence can be the nutritional deficiency called scurvy. However, the predicted ancestors of humans had this function (as do most other animals except primates and guinea pigs). Therefore, we predict that humans, other primates, and guinea pigs should carry evidence of this lost function as a molecular vestigial character (nota bene: this very prediction was explicitly made by Nishikimi and others and was the impetus for the research detailed below) (Nishikimi et al. 1992; Nishikimi et al. 1994).\n Confirmation:\n \n Recently, the L-gulano-&#947;-lactone oxidase gene, the gene required for Vitamin C synthesis, was found in humans and guinea pigs (Nishikimi et al. 1992; Nishikimi et al. 1994). It exists as a pseudogene, present but incapable of functioning (see prediction 4.4 for more about pseudogenes). In fact, since this was originally written the vitamin C pseudogene has been found in other primates, exactly as predicted by evolutionary theory. We now have the DNA sequences for this broken gene in chimpanzees, orangutans, and macaques (Ohta and Nishikimi 1999). And, as predicted, the malfunctioning human and chimpanzee pseudogenes are the most similar, followed by the human and orangutan genes, followed by the human and macaque genes, precisely as predicted by evolutionary theory. Furthermore, all of these genes have accumulated mutations at the exact rate predicted (the background rate of mutation for neutral DNA regions like pseudogenes) (Ohta and Nishikimi 1999). \n\n \n And you say:\n \n \nThe basic problem here is that evolutionists have ASSUMED that genes (and gene states) occur in different animals because of the result of evolution. In other words since humans and other primates share the same defective gene, then that must mean we are all related to some mysterious ancestor in the past. In their minds there is no way that this defective gene could have appeared independently in humans and other primates without common descent being involved. And the reason for this is they ASSUME that genetic mutations are random. But, there's another side to the story....read on:\n\n \n Its clear you are not familar with the concept of evidence isn't it. ONE rational explanation for finding the same defective gene in a linage is that it was inherited during evolution of that linage! Its NOT proof, but by darn its consistent with the theory that the defect arose once and was inherited from that point foward. Or do you think otherwise - ie that the pattern is INCONSISTENT with a common origin of the now non-functional gene? Of course its always possible that the same mutation DID occurr de-novo in eaxh species in which its found. However this would be inconsistent with known phylogenetics of the primates (from other lines of data). In addition its entirely possible that the gene was lost independently in more than one linage and then propagated to the descendants of that linage. Thus guniea pigs and SOME (but apparently not all) chiropetra lack a functional gene (notably FRUIT BATS lack the functional gene while other spp apparently have a functional version - this is consistent with the diet of FRUIT bats of course).\n \n I don't see how any of what you said supports your claim, nor how PBs \"paper\" would lead to your statements for that matter.

It is so clear to me now that every piece of \"evidence\" that they have ever presented is the result of deception at one level or another. \n \n\n \n Good for you are you going to get on with it or are you going to P&M like Behe at Dover?\n \n \nOne of the greatest examples of deception is the use of the Vitamin C (or gulo gene) as \"evidence\" for common descent.\n \n \n We are all ears out here. Get on with it!\n \n \nHowever, I am going to show that this is not evidence in any way, shape or form of common descent. Towards the end of this post, it will become perfectly clear exactly how these people are using a sleight-of-hand to deceive people....it will also become perfectly clear why primates and humans both have this defective gene.\n\n \n So just do what you say you are. And by the way we already know why fruit eating primates and their descendants lack a working copy of GLUO. Its been lost in SOME of the species in which it was not useful, and of course in species where it was useful it could not be lost since any individual carrying a defective gene would DIE and fail to REPRODUCE. Natural selection you understand!\n \n \nThe basic problem here is that evolutionists have ASSUMED that genes (and gene states) occur in different animals because of the result of evolution. \n\n \n Nope thats not a problem, its what one would anticipate, and you have it reveresed in any case. Evolutionists assume that evolution occurrs when gene frequencies change. They do not assume that evolution is the cause they assume its the effect of such changes. But I digress as any old and worn academic is prone to do. Occupational hazard - too many solvent fumes you know.\n \n \nIn other words since humans and other primates share the same defective gene, then that must mean we are all related to some mysterious ancestor in the past. In their minds there is no way that this defective gene could have appeared independently in humans and other primates without common descent being involved. And the reason for this is they ASSUME that genetic mutations are random. But, there's another side to the story....read on:\n\n \n Nope its more like SHOULD humans and primates have a common ancestor its likely that there will be genes (or psuedogenes) that are found in the presumed linage of the group. Indeed evolutionists would predict that this would be the case. The finding of such genes (and there are a lot of them) would be consistent with the theory of common descent among the species in the group. {Note well this is especially the case for a pseudogene - for reasons I will not go into here lest I be accussed of lecturing).\n \n \nI believe that God made each creature with the ability to adapt to different environments. This environmental adaptation has nothing what-so-ever to do with evolving into another kind of creature. Change over time is merely a tool that allows organisms to keep from going extinct. It's this genomic plasticity that helps ensure their survival.\n\n \n Your beliefs are not evidence and they are not relevant to the issue you have raised. Namely whether conclusions drawn from GULO information constitute slight of hand.\n \n \nOk. so instead of looking at this from the evolutionists' standpoint, let's look at this from a different angle. Let's put ourselves in the Garden of Eden. We see Adam and Eve consuming all kinds of fruits and vegetables. In fact, at first that's probably all they ate, since that's what was given to them, (as reported in Genesis.) Going from that point forward, it's pretty easy to imagine that the earth was filled with fruit trees, wild vines with berries, and a human population that was intelligent enough to engage in agriculture.\n\n \n Lets not after all what relevance does a fairy tale you tell have with regard to whether or not evolutionists have been deceptive with regard to GULO? None! We all know that primates (including humans) often eat fruits and vegs which contain substantial vit C.\n \n \nSo with that, it's also pretty easy to imagine that there was no NEED for the human genome to mutate to accommodate a fruitless/vitaminC-less diet. Likewise, we also know that primates also consume a diet high in fruits, leaves and berries, thereby getting plenty of vitamin C. So like humans, primates would have no reason for their genomes to mutate if they ate fruits and leaves high in vitamin C from the beginning.\n\n \n Well yes, but thats not what DEFECTIVE GULO indicates. If one has external sources of vitamin C, GULO can mutate to be inactive without causing a problem, and once inactive the inactive gene can be inherited without causing problems so long as vitamin C intake is high enough. An inactive GULO indicates that the species has external sources of vitamin C which is essential to many metabolic processes.\n \n \nSo at this point we have humans and other primates both consuming diets high in vitamin C, and both containing \"defective\" genomes that are unmutated. This is simply the result of eating fruits from the onset of creation, thus not requiring a mutation to create vitamin C internally.\n\n \n Nope the defective gene is itself a mutation of the active form of the enzyme. And the mutation to the defective gene would occurr at random but would only be inherited in linages which have external sources of C in their diet. It is not necessarily the case that such a mutation would occurr in every species with high vit C intake please note.\n \n \nSo what about all the other mammals? Why is it that they are able to create their own vitamin C? Well let's think about it. Look at cows, horses, buffalo, deer, and other grazing animals.....none of them consume fruit...they all consume mainly grasses. Look at bears. They may eat some fruit, but their diet mostly requires a high intake of fats, which means fish and whatever other kinds of animals they can kill. Rodents may also consume some berries, but probably mostly seeds and nuts. Other mammals such as cats and dogs eat mostly meat. No fruits, no berries, little -- if any -- vitamin C.\n\n \n Yep and if you get say a bear with a defective GULO gene it will die since it cannot survive and reproduce without adequate vit C being made internally. Its diet will usually not provide an adequate source. Carnivores must maintain a working copy of GULO else they will die out.\n \n \nThe point that I'm making here is that there are not too many other mammals whose diets are high in vitamin C. So, what must have happened at some point was that their genomes mutated to accommodate this vitamin C-less diet. \n\n \n Nope it worked the other way round my friend. Somewhere along the line AFTER the hypothetical ancestor switched to a vitamin C rich diet GULO suffered a frame shift and ceased to be an effective enzyme. For species with high C intake this makes no difference with regard to survival or reproduction. The defective gene could only be retained by those linages which continued to consume exogenous C in adequate amounts.\n \n \nI believe every animal was probably initally created to be vegetarians, and at some point after the Fall, any animal populations that did not consume a regular diet high in vitamin C experienced a mutation so that it could be produced internally.\n\n \n You can believe what you want, your beliefs are not relevant to the issue.\n \n \nThere are actually other animals, though, such as the guinea pig and the fruit bat who, like humans require vitamin C and are unable to produce it internally. In my mind, this simply means that they've always eaten fruits or diets high in vitamin C, thus their genomes have not needed to mutate to accommodate a diet low in Vitamin C! (Is this stuff not just obvious common sense?)\n\n \n The bats (which are not in the primate linage) do not appear to make vitamin C. Whether they have the pseudogene or not I have not determined.\n \n S\no at the beginning I promised you that I would expose the slight-of-hand evolutionists are using. It's simply this: when they present the argument that the inability to produce vitamin C proves common descent, they are doing so under the guise that this genetic mutation (or lack of it) is a MISTAKE! The reality is, there is no \"mistake.\" It is simply an unmutated gene that remains unmutated because there was no need for a mutation. Since humans and primates consume a diet high in fruits, the genome has no need to change.\n\n \n Sorry but the gene in humans is not a gene at all. Its an unexpressed pseudogene. A sequece which does not code for anything. And of course since the primate linage is more recent (and provably so) than the other mammals which DO make C you have the chronological relationships reversed. Being backwards seems to be your forte. You assume in effect that all species are co-temporal - a great error.\n \n \nAnd all this would be very easy to test. All evolutionary science would have to do is take some guinea pigs (or fruit bats), isolate them from fruits and other sources of vitamin C for a few generations, let them breed and see if the future generations mutate! There is, of course, no guarantee that a mutation would ensure survival, but it would be interesting to see if a mutation indeed happened. But have there been any such tests? Of course not! Why? Because evolutionary science is not interested in the truth. They could care less about real science and they could care less if mutations are random or nonrandom as long as the population believes we share a common ancestor with a chimp\n.\n \n A non-viable experiment. You would likely wait a million years or more for the mutation to occurr (yes reversion IS possible); however, if you isolate species requiring C from a source of C for even a single generation there will be no offspring by generation 2 at the latest! I suppose you could round up something like 10 billion guinea pigs and see if any survived no C in their diets, but its not practical to do so. I think its a reasonable inference that such difficulties may be why your proposed experiment is likely to be met with some degree of reluctance.\n \n \nAs you can see, though, this Vitamin C thing absolutely does not prove common descent. There is a perfectly rational explanation as to why humans and primate genomes have not mutated like other mammals' have.\n\n \n Science does not PROVE things. Science can (by empirical induction) only falsify things with certainty. Hypotheses not yet falsified are held to be PROVISIONALLY true but not proven. And there is a perfectly rational explanation all right, namely that the working GULO gene mutated to ineffectiveness in animals with a high vitiman C intake and was subsequently passed on, and that because such animals could not make vitmin C they continued to require diets high in C.\n \n O\nn the link below you will see that this Gulo gene happens to be in an area in the genome that is more likely to mutate, called a hotspot. Hotspots, being more likely than others to mutate, indicates just what I said earlier: that organisms were set up to be adaptive to different environments\n\n \n Its in a hot spot, but that does not have the consequences you wish to assert.",

   "I simply hate long, drawn-out dialog, but I'm bored too so I guess I'll play along.\n \n \n \n So just do what you say you are. And by the way we already know why fruit eating primates and their descendants lack a working copy of GLUO. Its been lost in SOME of the species in which it was not useful, and of course in species where it was useful it could not be lost since any individual carrying a defective gene would DIE and fail to REPRODUCE. Natural selection you understand! \n\n \n Yeap...that's your mantra. Or, the alternative could be as I explained. Simply saying it's the other way doesn't make it be.\n \n SS: The basic problem here is that evolutionists have ASSUMED that genes (and gene states) occur in different animals because of the result of evolution. \n \n \n \n Nope thats not a problem, its what one would anticipate, and you have it reveresed in any case. Evolutionists assume that evolution occurrs when gene frequencies change. They do not assume that evolution is the cause they assume its the effect of such changes. But I digress as any old and worn academic is prone to do. Occupational hazard - too many solvent fumes you know.\n\n \n Yes, that is the problem, because if you were to admit that changes in biology happened nonrandomly then you would have to admit that this could very well be an environmentally-induced change and have absolutely nothing to do with selection. You are simply repeating your position, which does not negate mine.\n \n SS: In other words since humans and other primates share the same defective gene, then that must mean we are all related to some mysterious ancestor in the past. In their minds there is no way that this defective gene could have appeared independently in humans and other primates without common descent being involved. And the reason for this is they ASSUME that genetic mutations are random. But, there's another side to the story....read on: \n \n \nNope its more like SHOULD humans and primates have a common ancestor its likely that there will be genes (or psuedogenes) that are found in the presumed linage of the group..\n\n \n wrong. You assume common ancestory as a given....then go from there by making all the \"evidence\" fit into that assumption.\n \n \n Indeed evolutionists would predict that this would be the case. The finding of such genes (and there are a lot of them) would be consistent with the theory of common descent among the species in the group. ..\n\n \n fine...but that's different than calling it \"evidence\" for common descent. If the same evidence can fit nicely in a creationist perspective then it's not really evidence for ToE. I just gave you a perfectly plausible explanation.\n \n SS: I believe that God made each creature with the ability to adapt to different environments. This environmental adaptation has nothing what-so-ever to do with evolving into another kind of creature. Change over time is merely a tool that allows organisms to keep from going extinct. It's this genomic plasticity that helps ensure their survival. \n \n \nYour beliefs are not evidence and they are not relevant to the issue you have raised. Namely whether conclusions drawn from GULO information constitute slight of hand...\n\n \n My \"beliefs\" are merely not assuming that we descended from a common ancestor. Thus, I'm looking at the situation from a different angle. The slight of hand I was referring to was about evolutionists calling the inability to produce vitamin C a \"mistake.\"\n \n \n SS: Ok. so instead of looking at this from the evolutionists' standpoint, let's look at this from a different angle. Let's put ourselves in the Garden of Eden. We see Adam and Eve consuming all kinds of fruits and vegetables. In fact, at first that's probably all they ate, since that's what was given to them, (as reported in Genesis.) Going from that point forward, it's pretty easy to imagine that the earth was filled with fruit trees, wild vines with berries, and a human population that was intelligent enough to engage in agriculture. \n \n \nLets not after all what relevance does a fairy tale you tell have with regard to whether or not evolutionists have been deceptive with regard to GULO? None! We all know that primates (including humans) often eat fruits and vegs which contain substantial vit C....\n\n \n I could say the same about common descent. You are assuming common descent -- you believe in it, as do other evos at least in part because of the vitamin C thing. I think you are the one dreaming because the evidence doesn't support it. You can't even give me a single example of a mutation that creates a new beneficial modification to phenotype. How in the world did the cell or the brain or the eye or any other organ evolve?\n \n \n \nAn inactive GULO indicates that the species has external sources of vitamin C which is essential to many metabolic processes.....\n\n \n And? How is that different than what I said? I simply am saying that there's a reason it's active or if it's not....and the reason is diet. If the diet changes in humans, for instance, there may very well be a change in this. Who knows.\n \n SS: So at this point we have humans and other primates both consuming diets high in vitamin C, and both containing \"defective\" genomes that are unmutated. This is simply the result of eating fruits from the onset of creation, thus not requiring a mutation to create vitamin C internally. \n \n \n \n Nope the defective gene is itself a mutation of the active form of the enzyme. And the mutation to the defective gene would occurr at random but would only be inherited in linages which have external sources of C in their diet. It is not necessarily the case that such a mutation would occurr in every species with high vit C intake please note.\n \n Why are you calling this gene \"defective?\" It's not defective. And are you telling me that it's humans and primates who have mutated -- and not animals that don't consume diets of vitamin C?? \n \n \n \nYep and if you get say a bear with a defective GULO gene it will die since it cannot survive and reproduce without adequate vit C being made internally.....\n\n \n unless it reproduces before it dies....mutations usually happen during development.\n \n \n \n \nNope it worked the other way round my friend. Somewhere along the line AFTER the hypothetical ancestor switched to a vitamin C rich diet GULO suffered a frame shift and ceased to be an effective enzyme. .....\n\n \n um...how do you know this? Is there any scientific evidence for it? it could just as easily happened the way I described it. All we know for sure is that primates and humans need vitamin C in the form of diet, while other animals don't. How this came to be is not known, and for you to assume that humans and primates once had this enzyme is an unsubstantiated guess.\n \n \n SS: I believe every animal was probably initally created to be vegetarians, and at some point after the Fall, any animal populations that did not consume a regular diet high in vitamin C experienced a mutation so that it could be produced internally\n \n \n \nYou can believe what you want, your beliefs are not relevant to the issue......\n\n \n lol....my explanation is just as valid as yours. You cannot show me any evidence that it happened your way. It's merely a guess based on your assumption of common descent. Since I do not assume common descent I do not corner myself with a explanation that can never be validated.\n \n \n SS: And all this would be very easy to test. All evolutionary science would have to do is take some guinea pigs (or fruit bats), isolate them from fruits and other sources of vitamin C for a few generations, let them breed and see if the future generations mutate!

How would you know unless you tried it?\n \n Science does not PROVE things.\n \n not anything regarding ToE, anyway.\n \n \n  Science can (by empirical induction) only falsify things with certainty.\n \n then why don't they falsify that mutations happen nonrandomly? Oh, that's right, because they can't.\n \n http://www.molevol.org/camel/projects/synthesis/\n \n Its in a hot spot, but that does not have the consequences you wish to assert.  \n \n Hotspots validate my claim that animals were set up to change with changing conditions.",

Why would we have a useless broke step three? Why did all the other animals, according to you also get a useless gene. and then they all fixed it and then made subsequent changes? That makes no sense.

   "There are some interesting complications in the data set. Specifically, multiple alterations are seen at several locations, so it is fair to suggest that there are mutational hotspots, or at least locations where mutations were tolerated while the gene was still functional. These are sites 55, 76, 97, 131, and 156. However, there is nothing wrong with some sites permitting more mutations than others - proteins are functional molecules, and have to meet certain shape requirements for some tasks. \n \n I'm not sure about apes having a deletion at site 97, while macaques have a deletion at site 100. Since apes evolved from old world monkeys, the simplest pattern would be if apes and macaques share a single deletion. However, Borger notes that apes can't make vitamin C, that catarrhines (old world monkeys can), and that platyrrhines (new world monkeys) can't. As macaques are old world monkeys, I'm not sure what the difference means - can anybody else here shed any light on this?\n \n \nHotspots validate my claim that animals were set up to change with changing conditions. \n\n So why are synonymous mutations among the most common?\n \n \n \nI began to learn how their minds work and how to quickly spot their deceptions. Now, with much practice, exposing evolutionists' tricks has become second nature. It is so clear to me now that every piece of \"evidence\" that they have ever presented is the result of deception at one level or another.\n\n Scientists can make mistakes, as we are human, after all. Being human also means that, regrettably, there are occasional episodes of fraud and deception in science. However, these are rare - first, we are trained to go where the data takes us, and secondly the nature of science is that frauds in science that are of any significance will inevitably be discovered. However, charging a whole field with deception seems insane. In contrast, so far, your boastfulness and aspersions are looking pretty hollow.",

Since animals were going to need a fixed version eventually, why not just give everyone a fixed version in the first place? Why on earth would he give us working versions of the two genes that make precursors to vitamin C, so our bodies are pumping out the precursors, only for the lack of the third gene those things go to waste and simply undergo proteolytic degradation. \n \n And while Adam and Eve did not need a vitamin-C gene, was god unable to foresee that a lot of innocent sailors in later years would die hideous deaths from scurvy? He could have easily avoided that problem from the get-go, or he could have stuck a verse in Genesis where he instructed Noah to take some limes along, or put something in Deuteronomy that said, \"And if thou goeth more than several months to sea, for My sake includeth oranges amongst thy comestibles.\" But he didn't. So why do you think he wanted boatloads of sailors to die from scurvy? And the people at risk aren't just sailors: historically, victims have included many soldiers (including many crusaders) and people in beseiged cities, and in the modern world refugees who are dependent on international donations of rice, wheat, and corn. Check out why the eastern cedar is called arborvitae, the 'tree of life'.)\n \n And even if he had wanted us to be capable of dying from scurvy, why not simply insert the whole working gene, and simply provide something that turned the gene off or blocked its action. Our genomes are full of genes that do those things. That way turning it back on when needed would be simple, and all the animals wouldn't have had to wait for beneficial mutations to occur, as per your model. \n \n \nI believe every animal was probably initally created to be vegetarians, and at some point after the Fall, any animal populations that did not consume a regular diet high in vitamin C experienced a mutation so that it could be produced internally.\n Won't work. The mutation will first be expressed in the next round of offspring, before which time the prospective parents will have died from scurvy. \n \n \n (SS)Oh?

   "And SS if you are going to do your guinea pig experiment there are some things below that you need to know.\n \n \n \nAscorbicnd Acid\n \n The ascorbic acid requirement of the guinea pig has been reviewed by Mannering (1949). Navia and Hunt (1976) summarized the major metabolic roles for ascorbic acid in this animal. The daily requirement of ascorbic acid varied from 0.4 to 25 mg/day according to the criterion used to evaluate adequacy. Values reported to support growth were 0.4 to 2 mg/day in 250 to 350 g guinea pigs; reproduction was supported by 2 to 5 mg/day (Mannering, 1949). Scurvy was prevented by 1.3 to 2.5 mg/day; odontoblast growth, wound healing, and bone regeneration were supported by 2 mg/day; and tissue saturation occurred at 25 to 30 mg/day. Approximately 7 mg of ascorbic acid/kg BW was adequate to maintain adrenal size and odontoblast height in male guinea pigs ranging from 110 to 840 g BW (Pfander and Mitchell, 1952). Collins and Elvehjem (1958) found 5 mg/kg BW sufficient for growth of immature guinea pigs.\n \n The liver, kidney, plasma, lens, and aqueous humor concentration of ascorbic acid reflected the amount of ascorbic acid fed (0.8 to 60 mg/animal/day) to both young and old guinea pigs. The half-life of tissue ascorbate was reported to be the same in guinea pigs provided a maintenance dose (0.5 mg/day) or a higher dose (30 mg/100 g BW/day) (Ginter et al., 1982). A concentration of 50 mg/kg diet was marginal for survival. At 200 mg/kg diet, hepatic ascorbic acid accumulated in the liver. Adrenal and splenic concentrations increased with concentrations of 900 mg/kg diet (Degkwitz and Boedeker, 1989). Higher tissue concentrations were achieved by mixing the vitamin in the diet (500 mg/kg) than by daily oral administration (Ginter et al., 1979). An intake of 5 mg/day provides adequate amounts of ascorbic acid for growth and reproduction; normal intake of 200 mg/kg diet (1,135 \u00b5mol/kg diet) will fulfill this need.\n \n Ascorbic acid absorption was reported to be sodium dependent and involve a transporter molecule (Siliparandi et al., 1979). Dehydroascorbic acid was readily absorbed and reduced by dehydroascorbic acid reductase to ascorbic acid in the intestinal mucosa. Transport of endogenous ascorbate across the basolateral membrane assures the mucosal cell access to the vitamin in the absence of a dietary supply (Rose et al., 1988).\n \n The stability of ascorbic acid in diets varies with the composition of the diet, storage temperature, and humidity. Approximately one-half of the initial ascorbic acid may be oxidized and lost 90 days after the diet has been mixed. Aqueous solutions may lose vitamin C potency rapidly.\n \n Ascorbic acid at 0.5 mg/kg BW prevented rapid fatal scurvy and 55 percent of guinea pigs survived, but after 16 weeks these animals exhibited a marked increase in serum cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, VLDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and total lipids. The LDL:HDL ratio rose from 1.13 to 19.02 with cholesterol added at 3 g/kg diet (Kothari and Sharma, 1988) and stimulated the oxidation of ascorbic acid to carbon dioxide (Ginter and Zloch, 1972). Magnesium L-ascorbic acid phosphate has been shown to cure scurvy in the guinea pig (Machlin et al., 1979), but L-ascorbic acid 2-sulfate did not have antiscorbutic activity (Tsujimura, 1978).\n \n Signs of Ascorbic Acid Deficiency Early signs of vitamin C deficiency in guinea pigs were reduced diet intake and weight loss, followed by anemia and widespread hemorrhages. An impaired clotting mechanism, as indicated by increased prothrombin time, also contributes to hemorrhaging with vitamin C deficiency. Resting body temperatures were higher in scorbutic guinea pigs than normal animals (Green et al., 1980). Deficiency resulted in muscle damage but not neuropathy (Sillevis Smitt et al., 1991). Ascorbic acid-deficient animals were dead within 3 to 4 weeks from the causes noted above or from secondary bacterial infections, to which guinea pigs are susceptible. Ascorbate deficiency has been linked to an impairment in carnitine synthesis, increased urinary carnitine excretion, and prolonged survival time with carnitine supplementation (Jones and Hughes, 1982; Alkonyi et al., 1990).\n \n Vitamin C deficiency resulted in decreased vitamin B12 absorption; increased absorption of alanine and leucine; enhanced activity of brush border sucrase, alkaline phosphatase, and leucine aminopeptidase; and higher concentrations of intestinal membrane sialic acid and total lipids (Dulloo et al., 1982). Deficiency also reduced oxalate ab\n",

Also, nobody but you has this definition of 'phenotype', and again you're wrong. \n \n From http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/bc/ahp/BioInfo/GP/Definition.html\n \nPhenotype\n This is the \"outward, physical manifestation\" of the organism. These are the physical parts, the sum of the atoms, molecules, macromolecules, cells, structures, metabolism, energy utilization, tissues, organs, reflexes and behaviors; anything that is part of the observable structure, function or behavior of a living organism.\n \n Genotype\n This is the \"internally coded, inheritable information\" carried by all living organisms. This stored information is used as a \"blueprint\" or set of instructions for building and maintaining a living creature. These instructions are found within almost all cells (the \"internal\" part), they are written in a coded language (the genetic code), they are copied at the time of cell division or reproduction and are passed from one generation to the next (\"inheritable\"). These instructions are intimately involved with all aspects of the life of a cell or an organism. They control everything from the formation of protein macromolecules, to the regulation of metabolism and synthesis. \n\n So you are indeed completely uninformed on this point. \n \n In fact, it's worse than that. You've been told this information several times before, on several bulletin boards, and yet you still repeat it. And yet you accuse us of being deceptive! At what point does continued willful mistatement become lying, hmmm?\n \n Also, I was responding to your statement that \"Mutations seem to be reserved for internal functions \", which is nonsense as written. To cite some examples: from Wikipedia, achrondroplasia \"is a result of an autosomal dominant mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor gene 3 (FGFR3), which causes an abnormality of cartilage formation. FGFR3 normally has a negative regulatory effect on bone growth. In achondroplasia, the mutated form of the receptor is constitutively active and this leads to severely shortened bones.\" The double muscle aspect of bully whippets is due to the mutation MSTN in the myostatin-producing gene. A comparable mutation can be seen in http://fig.cox.miami.edu/~cmallery/150/neuro/belgian.blue.jpg\n \n And for a similar mutation in humans, see \n http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Science/2004/06/24/512617.html\n http://fig.cox.miami.edu/~cmallery/150/neuro/myostatin.htm",

Evolutionary theory makes the claim that evolutionary change is at least primarily genetic in nature, so if a lot of epigenetic change was found, especially if it was found to be the rule, I think that would count as an overthrow of modern evolutionary theory.\n \n Also, evolutionary processes are not restricted to RM&NS.

   "http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/21/science/21prot.html?ref=science\n \n Thats just to wrap up the general subject of genes through history and their modifications.\n \n \nAugust 21, 2007\n Ancient Protein Tells a Story of Changing Functions\n By KENNETH CHANG\n \n Offering insight into how evolution progresses inside a gene, scientists have pinpointed mutations in an ancient protein that transformed its shape and function more than 400 million years ago.\n \n Scientists at the University of Oregon and the University of North Carolina used modern technologies to conduct an archaeology of genes and help answer a longstanding question about how proteins change over time and develop new roles.\n \n \"We have now seen the mechanisms by which a new function evolves at the atomic level, how evolution sculpted the protein structure to produce a new function,\" said Joseph W. Thornton, a biology professor at Oregon who led the research.\n \n The findings were published last week on the Web site of the journal Science.\n \n A few mutations in a gene, which is a section of DNA that provides the blueprint for a specific protein, can result in a protein that no longer folds properly. That makes the protein useless, because it is the shape of a protein that largely determines which molecules it can bind to, and hence, its function.\n \n The probability that subsequent mutations could reshape the unfolded protein into a form with a new function is essentially zero, and that is an evolutionary cul de sac.\n \n Supporters of intelligent design, who question evolution, have argued that mutations, occurring one by one, could not refold a protein into a new function, because the mutations would first unravel the protein into a useless, unfolded configuration.\n \n The new study refutes that assertion, at least in this instance. Dr. Thornton's research focuses on proteins known as hormone receptors that act as locks in a key-and-lock mechanism. When a hormone fits into a receptor, the receptor sends a signal to another part of the cell.\n \n In work published last year, Dr. Thornton reported how his group reconstructed an ancestral protein of two hormone receptors found in humans. The two, once identical, diverged along different evolutionary paths. One is now part of the stress response system; the other is involved in different biological processes, including kidney function in many animals.\n \n In the new study, the researchers determined the exact positions of more than 2,000 atoms in the ancestral hormone receptor. The receptor existed in animals that lived more than 440 million years ago, before the last common ancestor of people and sharks. Then the researchers examined what occurred during the next 20 million years - before another split of the evolutionary tree that led to bony fish. \"That's the ancestor of you and a salmon,\" Dr. Thornton said.\n \n In that time, one hormone receptor changed so that it bound most strongly to cortisol, a stress hormone. Bony fish and people have this version, called a glucocorticoid receptor. Sharks do not.\n \n Of the glucocorticoid receptors that have been looked at in different species, five specific mutations are always present and distinguish them from the ancestral receptor. When the scientists introduced the five changes into the ancestral protein, they expected that it would be transformed into a glucocorticoid receptor.\n \n Instead, the protein broke, unable to bind to any hormone.\n \n On further investigation, the scientists found that two other mutations, which had negligible effects by themselves, strengthened some of the protein's folds so it could withstand the other five mutations. The researchers were also able to show several sequences in which the seven mutations could have occurred without the protein's functionality ever deteriorating.\n \n Biologists often point out that evolution does not proceed through random chance. Rather, the process of natural selection - survival of the fittest - ruthlessly weeds out mutations detrimental to the survival of a species.\n \n But the findings of Dr. Thornton and his colleagues show that some aspects of evolution do occur solely by chance. The two mutations that reinforced the protein did not directly help the organism. So natural selection did not particularly favor them. It was only by chance that they occurred and persisted to set the groundwork for the other mutations.\n \n Other seemingly innocuous mutations might have led evolution down another path. \"These very exquisitely adapted bodies we have represent a role of the dice,\" Dr. Thornton said. \"And they could have turned out very differently.\"\n",

   "Resistance to malaria is not a phenotypic trait.\n\n \n Oh yes it is. The word \"phenotype\" was created to fulfill a specific role in biological discussions, as a counterpart to \"genotype\". You are clueless about this, so you keep making stupid statements such as the above. \"Genotype\" is easy to understand - it's all the information encoded in the organism's DNA. \"Phenotype\" is also easily understood, by everyone but you. The phenotype is the sum total of all the results of that information AS EXPRESSED IN THE ORGANISM. If it is a trait (and resistance certainly is a trait that is expressed in the organism), then it is part of the phenotype. \n \n The reason for distinguishing the two concepts, and thus the justification for the two words, is that there are several disjunctions between the information that the genes contain and the resulting expression as actual traits in the organism. Many traits are the result of multiple genes. Much of an organism's DNA is not genes. Quite a few of the genes that are present are never turned on. Some genes have multiple effects depending on what else is going on. Some of what you see in an organism is not of genetic origin. So, you encounter an organism, you observe a trait (which is by definition part of the organism's phenotype), and you investigate how it relates to the genotype, if at all. (Separately, you investigate how the trait affects fitness.)\n \n As I said earlier, what you actually need to do is to stop using the word phenotype (and stop making insane statements like \"Mutations seem to be reserved for internal functions\") and simply argue that you are unsatisfied that the extent of changes demonstrated to result from mutations is capable of causing the sorts of large-scale changes needed to create a new phylum, or for that matter even a new type of limb or organ (or whatever you want to claim).

How do you propose to detect that rate against the existing prevalance of the gene? Not a chance in hades without mounting a truly massive effort which would accomplish nothing at all practical. And in a small population like texas you are looking at less than a single instance per generation! Pretty slim chance would you not say?\n \n \nWhy is it that the sickle cell disease only shows up in Africa and other malaria-plagued areas?\n \n \n It does not.

In fact you are at a reproductive disadvantage. But benefit is always contingent on context. And if you wish to argue that the resistance conferred is inadequate to confer a survival and reproduction advantage you will have to do it with data not references to WW (who is not notably into quantitative analysis). You produce the data and I will certainly consider it (as well as other data at my discretion). What you have to do is find relative fitness estimates. I am sure its been done go find it.\n \n \nAlso, has science ever done any studies to see if anyone offspring has acquired resistance to malaria without a parent being resistant?\n\n \n Of course they have, there is a vast literature out there relevant to immune responses to the parasite. Antibodies DO confer some resistance and they are acquired. Unfortunately the parasite has biological tricks up its sleeves which materially reduce the effectiveness of immune responses.",

From Wikipedia, \n \nIt is now known, from evaluation of chromosome structures, that there have been at least four independent mutational events, three in Africa and a fourth in either Saudi Arabia or central India. These independent events occurred between 3,000 and 6,000 generations ago, approximately 70,000-150,000 years.\n\n It may well have arisen elsewhere too. However, in areas without malaria the new owners would have experienced only the disadvantages and none of the benefits, so it would have relatively quickly been selected back out of the population. Remember, advantages and disadvantages depend on context, and you are trying to compare two different situations.\n \n A little more information from Wikipedia:\n \nThis is normally a benign mutation, causing no apparent effects on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of hemoglobin. What it does allow for, under conditions of low oxygen concentration, is the polymerization of the HbS itself. The deoxy form of hemoglobin exposes a hydrophobic patch on the protein between the E and F helices. The hydrophobic residues of the valine at position 6 of the beta chain in hemoglobin are able to bind to the hydrophobic patch, causing hemoglobin S molecules to aggregate and form fibrous precipitates.\n \n The allele responsible for sickle-cell anaemia is autosomal recessive and can be found on the 11th chromosome. A person who receives the defective gene from both father and mother develops the disease; a person who receives one defective and one healthy allele remains healthy, but can pass on the disease and is known as a carrier. If two parents who are carriers have a child, there is a 1-in-4 chance of their child developing the illness and a 1-in-2 chance of their child just being a carrier. Since the gene is incompletely recessive, carriers have a few sickle red blood cells at all times, not enough to cause symptoms, but enough to give resistance to malaria. Because of this, heterozygotes have a higher fitness than either of the homozygotes. This is known as heterozygote advantage.\n \n Due to the evolutionary advantage of the heterozygote, the illness is still prevalent, especially among people with recent ancestry in malaria-stricken areas, such as Africa, the Mediterranean, India and the Middle East.\n",

   "However should you wish to get into a discussion of the fairly complex area of cancer genetics I suggest you might review a simplified summary from WIKI. You realize of course that you are stepping into a great morass of information here and that you will have to narrow your focus to specific example systems and models to begin to make sense of it. And of course much of the genetics here does not involve inheritance across generations or organisms but rather somatic cell lines only. \n \n \nPathophysiology\n Cancers are caused by a series of mutations. Each mutation alters the behavior of the cell somewhat.\n Cancers are caused by a series of mutations. Each mutation alters the behavior of the cell somewhat.\n \n Cancer is fundamentally a disease of regulation of tissue growth. In order for a normal cell to transform into a cancer cell, genes which regulate cell growth and differentiation must be altered. Genetic changes can occur at many levels, from gain or loss of entire chromosomes to a mutation affecting a single DNA nucleotide. There are two broad categories of genes which are affected by these changes. Oncogenes may be normal genes which are expressed at inappropriately high levels, or altered genes which have novel properties. In either case, expression of these genes promotes the malignant phenotype of cancer cells. Tumor suppressor genes are genes which inhibit cell division, survival, or other properties of cancer cells. Tumor suppressor genes are often disabled by cancer-promoting genetic changes. Typically, changes in many genes are required to transform a normal cell into a cancer cell.\n \n There is a diverse classification scheme for the various genomic changes which may contribute to the generation of cancer cells. Most of these changes are mutations, or changes in the nucleotide sequence of genomic DNA. Aneuploidy, the presence of an abnormal number of chromosomes, is one genomic change which is not a mutation, and may involve either gain or loss of one or more chromosomes through errors in mitosis.\n \n Large-scale mutations involve the deletion or gain of a portion of a chromosome. Genomic amplification occurs when a cell gains many copies (often 20 or more) of a small chromosomal locus, usually containing one or more oncogenes and adjacent genetic material. Translocation occurs when two separate chromosomal regions become abnormally fused, often at a characteristic location. A well-known example of this is the Philadelphia chromosome, or translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22, which occurs in chronic myelogenous leukemia, and results in production of the BCR-abl fusion protein, an oncogenic tyrosine kinase.\n \n Small-scale mutations include point mutations, deletions, and insertions, which may occur in the promoter of a gene and affect its expression, or may occur in the gene's coding sequence and alter the function or stability of its protein product. Disruption of a single gene may also result from integration of genomic material from a DNA virus or retrovirus, and such an event may also result in the expression of viral oncogenes in the affected cell and its descendants.\n \n Epigenetic changes are changes which do not affect chromosomal number or DNA sequence, but which can be passed on through generations of cell division, and thus may play a role in cancer. Known mechanisms of epigenetic change include DNA methylation, and methylation or acetylation of histone proteins bound to chromosomal DNA at specific locations.\n",

   "And if you want a little more about how often hemoglobin mutates then you may wish to subscribe here:\n \n http://patients.uptodate.com/topic.asp?file=red_cell/27283\n \n \n \nIntroduction to hemoglobin mutations\n \n \n Stanley L Schrier, MD\n Stephen A Landaw, MD, PhD\n \n UpToDate performs a continuous review of over 375 journals and other resources. Updates are added as important new information is published. The literature review for version 15.2 is current through May 2007; this topic was last changed on May 8, 2007. The next version of UpToDate (15.3) will be released in October 2007.\n \n INTRODUCTION - Over 800 different mutations of the globin chains of the human hemoglobin molecule have been discovered [1]. They are classified according to the type of mutation (eg, insertion, deletion, base change), the affected globin subunit (eg, alpha chain, beta chain), and by the clinical and hematologic phenotype (show table 1 and show table 2). This topic review will present an introduction to the most common of these mutations. Sickle hemoglobin and the thalassemias are discussed separately.\n \n INCIDENCE - The most important distinction that needs to be made when considering mutant hemoglobins is the frequency with which they are found in human populations. One group of mutant globin genes, including hemoglobins S, C, and E, is found at a frequency varying from 2 to 95 percent in different populations. These mutations are the product of expansion via selective external forces (eg, malaria) because, in the asymptomatic heterozygous form, they protect carriers from dying of malarial infection. (See \"Protection against malaria in the hemoglobinopathies\"). These mutations are ethnic-specific, in that they are present in some human populations and not in others.\n \n Hemoglobin mutants in the second group exist at frequencies below 1 percent, and many times occur as spontaneous mutations in the propositus. These mutations usually have no medical consequences, but a subset can have serious abnormalities when present in the homozygous form. They are not ethnic-specific and examples of the same mutation, originating independently, can be found in any ethnic group.\n \n \n Mutant hemoglobins that have frequencies of approximately 1 to 2 percent may or may not have been expanded by selection (eg, HbDLos Angeles, HbA2 (a delta chain mutation), HbG-Philadelphia, Hb Hasharon). An alternative explanation is that these abnormal hemoglobins have a slightly higher frequency than predicted by mutational pressure alone (ie, no selection due to external forces) because of a \"founder's effect\". This occurs when a population originates from a single \"founder\" or a small group of people that by chance had a high frequency of a particular non-selected hemoglobin mutation.\n \n The majority of hemoglobin mutants are not associated with any clinical manifestations. Many were discovered during the course of large population surveys. The \"classical\" diagnostic tool for the detection of new hemoglobin mutants was zone electrophoresis, which separates proteins differing in electrical charge. However, many mutant hemoglobins have normal electrophoretic mobility, and must be studied by other methods, such as high performance liquid chromatography. A number of more sophisticated techniques have also been applied to the detection of mutant hemoglobins, including mass spectrometry and sequencing of DNA fragments generated by the polymerase chain reaction [2-6]. (See \"Molecular diagnosis of inherited hemoglobin disorders\").\n",

   "Actually, I think I'm going to retract my admission regarding this double-muscling mutation. Here is my official challenge regarding mutations and their (in)abilities............(taken from Carm)\n \n \n Evolutionary theory is based on random mutations plus selection. Natural selection wades through all the raw material produced by mutations and then judges the fitness of this raw material. So here are my challenges: \n \n 1) I would like someone to show me how a random mutation can create the raw material that natural selection is supposed to be selecting: a physical body part or even a cellular structure. ANYTHING. I want to see evidence that random mutations can build new, complex machinery or a new physical structure such as a limb or organ. \n \n 2) I would like someone to show me an example of a mutation that creates a beneficial modification on an existing body part. Science has shown us in the lab how already-existing parts can be duplicated by way of mutations in regulatory genes....(fly wings, for example). Mutations have also shown to be associated with bacterial resistance. I accept both of these because they have been observed and shown to be scientifically valid. But what I'm asking for is the same scientific validation when it comes to a mutation creating a beneficial modification to an existing body part....(one that makes the animal more fit and more selectable than it was before). \n \n My contention here is that all mutations are either lethal, deterimental to the organism, or have nothing to do with the beneficial alteration of phenotype. Mutations do not create new body parts, nor do they modify existing body parts in a beneficial, selectable way. Without these two things, ToE is dead. The floor is open. \n \n this mutation that doubles the muscles is simply a duplication of already-existing structures by way of mutation, and thus, does not qualify as a legitimate answer to my challenge because what I am looking for is a change in the structure -- not a duplication of the same structure, which I already ackowledged. Duplications of existing structure will get ToE nowhere over the course of history....Darwinists need mutations to create beneficial changes/additions/novelties in structures.

More are possible, but either they didn't take or we haven't found them. Since we only test a small sample of the population, more mutations could well be out there. This does not help your case. \n \n \n Neither do science know that the mutations were de novo....they are merely guessing based on their worldview -- and for you to say otherwise is dishonest. \n I agree that it's an inference from the evidence, but it's suggested by distinct differences between the different versions - according to the experts on this, which I am not, the hundreds of different versions fall into four groups that are very hard to explain other than as four separate origins. Read Chemist's post for abundant relevant information. \n \n \nWe now know that cancer mutations are preceded by epigenetic changes....why is it so hard to believe that mutations leading to malaria resistance are the same? \n Chemist answered this one.\n \n \n \n(On myostatin) These animals are hardly more fit, and there are many known drawbacks.\n\n \n 1) \n Unlike in mice, a myostatin null mutation in cattle causes a reduction in sizes of internal organs\n \n For agricultural applications, there are some disadvantages to double-muscled cattle, namely the reduction in female fertility, lower viability of offspring, and delay in sexual maturation.\n\n \n From your own quote, \"unlike in mice\". Also, doctors were originally worried about the heart etc., of the boy in Germany, because of the known problems in cattle, but so far he has appeared fine in all respects. It's a bit early to tell about the fertility, of course. \n \n 2) I'm not disputing that there are drawbacks, but the key is the balance of the drawbacks and the advantages (which are to be judged solely by the context in which the organism exists). \n \n Every darn last thing in our bodies represents a balance of advantages and disadvantages (I'll do a post on this shortly). However, advantages and disadvantages depend on context, and it is easy to imagine contexts where the reproductive advantages of being a super-Schwarzenegger outweigh a hit taken in the fertility area. A 20% drop in sperm production would be more than offset if it also conferred a 100% increase in mating opportunities, whereas absolutely normal sperm production does you no good at all reproductively if no females will mate with you. Possibly you have personal experience that could apply in this area, assuming that you didn't pick the nickname Supersport in complete ignorance of its biological meaning. \n \n Delay in sexual maturation means very little in human terms, although it would be devastating if you were a cod in an overfished or intensely predated population. \n \n I'll get to your last post in a bit.",

   "You have made a big to-do over anything negative associated with some changes. You seem to feel that evolutionary theory needs some mutations to be completely 'beneficial', and that any negatives at all make that mutation a degradation. \n \n First, as we keep telling you, mutations that are disadvantageous in one situation can be disadvantageous in others, and vice versa. \n \n Second, pretty much everything in biology results from trade-offs and all changes come with both advantages and disadvantages, often at the same time. \"Normal\" represents not perfection, but adequacy, \"good enough for now\".\n \n Consider people. We've got this great brain, but it came at a huge cost:\n a) Giving birth used to be somewhere around 1-2% lethal in premedical times (and worse, 1 in 16 births, in areas of squalor, disease, and poverty),\n b) we now need significantly more food to fuel it (but it allows us to get even more food, so that's not a problem) (Isler and van Schaik, 2006, Biol. Lett. 2, 557-560, \"Metabolic costs of brain size evolution\"),\n c) babies are born with large brains, so giving birth has become very painful, and enlargement of the birth canal causes females to run funny and walk strangely (although they turned that into a courtship display - if life hands you lemons, make lemonade),\n d) to avoid killing the mother more than 1-2% of the time or so, babies are born comparatively brain-empty, in a condition way less developed than, e.g., all ungulates and most primates. This requires a long dependent infancy, prolonged brain growth outside the womb, and a shift to needing a prolonged education to get all the needed information back into the brain. \n \n How about walking upright? Primarily, this frees our hands and allows us to carry infants, carry food, use weapons, etc., etc., etc., so it's really useful to us. However, it costs fallen arches, shot knees, bad backs (ruptured disks, etc.), hernias, and so forth. However, these happen after the child-bearing years, so evolution couldn't care less about all your aching joints.\n \n Eyesight? Ours isn't that good. Hearing? Ours sucks. Smell? Your dog does better by many orders of magnitude. \n \n Size and strength are important to humans, so how come we haven't all been honed by natural selection to be much larger and stronger - after all, there certainly are very tall and/or very strong people, so it is certainly possible. However, size and strength come at a considerable maintenance cost in calroies, and during famines the big guys can find themselves at a huge, indeed lethal, disadvantage. There are also developmental costs to consider: calories invested in one region of the body are not available for expenditure in other areas.",

   " Evolutionary theory is based on random mutations plus selection. Natural selection wades through all the raw material produced by mutations and then judges the fitness of this raw material. So here are my challenges: \n \n 1) I would like someone to show me how a random mutation can create the raw material that natural selection is supposed to be selecting: a physical body part or even a cellular structure. ANYTHING. I want to see evidence that random mutations can build new, complex machinery or a new physical structure such as a limb or organ. \n \n 2) I would like someone to show me an example of a mutation that creates a beneficial modification on an existing body part. Science has shown us in the lab how already-existing parts can be duplicated by way of mutations in regulatory genes....(fly wings, for example). Mutations have also shown to be associated with bacterial resistance. I accept both of these because they have been observed and shown to be scientifically valid. But what I'm asking for is the same scientific validation when it comes to a mutation creating a beneficial modification to an existing body part....(one that makes the animal more fit and more selectable than it was before). \n \n My contention here is that all mutations are either lethal, deterimental to the organism, or have nothing to do with the beneficial alteration of phenotype. Mutations do not create new body parts, nor do they modify existing body parts in a beneficial, selectable way. Without these two things, ToE is dead. The floor is open. \n \n this mutation that doubles the muscles is simply a duplication of already-existing structures by way of mutation, and thus, does not qualify as a legitimate answer to my challenge because what I am looking for is a change in the structure -- not a duplication of the same structure, which I already ackowledged. Duplications of existing structure will get ToE nowhere over the course of history....Darwinists need mutations to create beneficial changes/additions/novelties in structures. So I take it back. :)\n\n \n (Evolution is not just M&NS. And you are still misusing \"phenotype\")\n \n 1) No one claims any such results from random mutations. We claim that they come from various combinations of mutations, selection, recombination, and drift. Once selection is involved, the process is no longer 'random', but stepwise alternation of random and non-random.\n \n Also, I gave you some examples back in \n http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?p=277655#post277655\n of how genes work in development to sculpt things like insect wings, whale limbs, and bat wings. These genes are obviously subject to mutations, which can modify the final output. So we have shown you HOW mutations can create major beneficial modifications to existing body parts.\n \n The overall process is slow, so we haven't produced brand new organs in the lab, but we've seen mutations change halteres into wings, produce new eyes, change antennae back into legs, and so forth, so we have shown ACTUAL MAJOR MODIFICATIONS to body parts, albeit not notably beneficial ones.\n \n \n 2) Beneficial mutations.\n You insist on your misunderstanding here. \"Beneficial\" is situational. We've given you several mutations that have clearly been beneficial in specific circumstances and several mutations that clearly could be beneficial under conditions that are easy to imagine.\n \n Duplication of chromosomes turned teosinte into corn, and was part of the process of producing modern wheat. The evolution of wheat (a series of duplications and hybridizations) has been repeated in the lab.\n \n \n 3) Your insistence against duplication is also unwarranted, since we know that duplication underlies numerous beneficial major changes of the sort that you ought to be focussing on.\n \n At our present level of knowledge, your specific demands haven't been met in a single demonstration. (Wheat evolution comes closest.) However, the combination of the sorts of things I gave you in 1 and 2, combined with additional information from genetics and the fossil record do demonstrate major beneficial evolutionary changes. \n \n Also, many of these changes begin with duplication. We know that genes can be duplicated. We know that structures can be duplicated. We know that duplicates of genes and duplicates of structures inevitably undergo subsequent modification. We see that modification of duplicates has led to some of the most fundamental advances in evolutionary history. We can tell that the front-most gill arch support bones in agnathan fish became jaws in gnathostome fish and subsequent vertebrates. We can tell that modification of the anteriormost vertebrae gave rise to good skull articulation via the axis and atlas bones. We can tell that fusion of the sacral vertebrae created the sacrum. We can tell that creation of a second jaw joint in the heads of therapsid reptiles allowed the original jaw joint bones to become specialized in their second function (transmission of sound), thus creating the mammalian inner ear. Two duplications of the homeobox gene set seem to have taken cephalochordates to agnathan 'fish' and on to gnathostome vertebrates. Etc.",

I realize I cannot say anything to change your mind that life is holistic, or that genes do not work in isolation, or that genes are under control of the cell, that the cell is under control of hormones and enzymes, that hormones and enzymes are under the control of the nervous system, that the nervous system has an amazing ability to read and respond to environmental changes, that these changes can be passed down to future generations thereby bypassing the silly premise darwinist have constructed for themselves that random changes in genes (culled by selection) are the cause of evolution -- but maybe you will listen to others that life may not be as reductionist as you think:\n \n http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/08/06/stories/05062523.htm\n \n THE SEQUENCING of the human genome was completed in February this year.

The HGP also confirms what has been known for years - that DNA sequences within one gene may be used in coding many proteins. There is also no more doubt, if ever there was any, that the control pathway of gene expression is not closed and linear, but dynamic and circular. Changes in the cellular environment are sensed or measured by regulatory networks of proteins that function inside each cell. These networks interpret such signals so that the cell can make an appropriate response to these changes. Thus, protein networks feed back information from the outside world to the DNA and change patterns of gene expression in a context-dependent manner. \n \n The crucial thing to note here is that these dynamic networks have rules not specified by DNA.

Many traits are the result of multiple genes. Much of an organism's DNA is not genes. Quite a few of the genes that are present are never turned on. Some genes have multiple effects depending on what else is going on. Some of what you see in an organism is not of genetic origin.\n\n What do you think that I think happens when 'some genes don't get turned on'?

Why is Venter qualifying his claims with \"known for years\" and \"There is also no more doubt, if ever there was any\"? - He's not saying that this stuff is newly discovered, but rather he's trying to puff up his results.\n \n I'm not the one with the problem here. You are so full of your own misunderstandings, your own preconceptions, your own wierd definitions, your own wierd religion-driven fantasies of the way things should be that you can't hear what anyone is saying and you can't process the relevant evidence.

You keep telling us all that evolutionary theory is just RMNS and randomness, when it isn't. You are inventing causes and processes without relevent supporting evidence. You keep making nutty requirements about phenotypes, beneficial mutations, abnormal traits, and so on, because you don't understand what the words mean. You keep citing literature that you think is supporting you when the citations disprove you, because you don't even understand what they are saying. \n \n I am perfectly willing to agree that 50 years from now our understanding of evolution is likely to be deeper and broader and in some ways different, hopefully even very important ways, from our current understanding. I actually look forward to that. However, we don't get from here to there by wishful and baseless re-interpretations of the sort that you and wascallywabbit engage in.
