   "Yulia Timoshenko = Ukrainian evil genius\n I got a little bit mixed up about poisoning Viktor Yuschenko and all the details of the thing. First, I was almost certain it was Ukrainian Security Service head Igor Smeshko who put poison into Viktor Yuschenko's meal while they were having supper together on 5 September at Vladimir Satsyuk's dacha. In some time, I learnt it was namely Igor Smeshko who saved the \"orange revolution\" by preventing the demonstrators from sloughing with the police squads. So it must be somebody else to benefit from Viktor Yuschenko's elimination. It might well be Yulia Timoshenko. Why not? It looks quite possible, indeed, taking into consideration she says from time to time - though in the lobby of Ukrainian Rada yet - that Yuschenko \"got tired\" and \"he needs to take care of his health now\". If Timoshenko becomes prime minister (as she has agreed with Yuschenko in writing) then the facts start to agree.",

Yulia Timoshenko's appointment will help balance the Yuschenko administration with a politician who favours a western strategy while he tries to improve relations with Putin. It is probably not wise to be content with Timoshenko at face value: her \"glamour\" is certainly a potent factor in her appeal. But to suggest that she would have gained an advantage from poisoning Yuschenko is absurd.",
