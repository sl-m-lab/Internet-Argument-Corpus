Here's another quote from your link: Fistulas are a scourge of the poor, affecting two million women and girls, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia  \n \n So tell us, PLEASE!!! How is this an argument which justifies abortions in America where Fistulas is virtually unknown as a result of child birth? Tell me how this quoted section below applies to any aspect of medical care in the USA.\n The women filled most of Ward 2, a long, one-story building with a cement floor and two rows of closely spaced beds against opposite walls. All had suffered from obstructed labor, meaning that their babies were too big or in the wrong position to pass through the birth canal. If prolonged, obstructed labor often kills the baby, which may then soften enough to fit through the pelvis, so that the mother delivers a corpse.\n \n Obstructed labor can kill the mother, too, or crush her bladder, uterus and vagina between her pelvic bones and the baby&#8217;s skull.

Especially since they know that valid reasons for abortions such as the life of the mother being at risk, incest and rape actually makes up less than 4% of all abortions procured. \n \n What they wont admit to is that for the other 96% of all abortions, they are giving women carte blanche to kill their inborn children when the child did nothing to create the situation that resulted in their conception at all. The guilty party in this instance alone is allowed to victimize the only innocent party in order to satisfy the selfish needs of the guilty party.\n \n In no other area of American Law is the guilty party allowed to kill the victim in order to alleviate taking responsibility for their own actions which created the issue in the first place. Abortion is likened to making it acceptable for the home invader to murder the home owner because it would be insane to allow a witness to remain who could identify them in court. \n \n And finally, you will notice that the pro-infanticide defender never wants to touch on the moral implications to America for participating in such a routine and organized multi billion dollar industry which is built on the shed blood of our most innocent and voiceless demographic, our future progeny. To think that each and every weekday of each year, America murders an average of 5000 human beings and these self declared human and civil rights advocates on the Left think this policy is moral and defendable speaks volumes about the moral and ethical divide in our Country. \n \n Just think, given that the normal hours for these clinics is mon-fri between the hours of 9-5, this Country averages killing 625 babies every business hour of every weekday in the land of the free. How proud they must be of the legacy of death that reality represents. emoticon_xdonno",

These people have no intellectual honesty and will never admit to your definition of when life begins without first siphoning it through their semantics filter and adding their caveat of mental existence. They must insist that mental awareness is relevant in placing individual value to the life of the unborn or else they must admit that they are condoning cold blooded murder, which they will never do.\n \n And since they will never define the issue in such a way that exposes the truth, you will never get past the definition aspect of this issue with them and therefore they have in fact neutralized your deeper argument by keeping you from ever getting to it.\n \n I choose not to wait for them to finally get intellectually honest since I have been here long enough to know that will never happen. All I can do is define what their side truly represents in the hope that the silent observers who read these forums will receive a coherent opposing view of what that side represents. \n \n In other words, I would like to see you post your facts and justifications for believing as you do and then watch them squirm incoherently as they twist in the wind with their shallow and self serving denials of what any rational person will immediately recognize as such.

   "No it cannot, and no amount of semantic gymnastics will make it so. As all your \"arguments\" seem to be predicated on this essential untruth, they fail. F\n\n \n This has been the debate all along, hasn't it? \n \n \"When does a child's life begin and when do their rights begin?\"\n \n I have posted numerous definitions which support my claims that a human beings life,... begins at and by conception. \n \n Words mean things. So, when someone posts a definition it is not just a play on words. It's to convey true meaning.\n \n The definitions for fetus and child refer to one another. A human fetus is a child and a child in the fetal stage of their life is called a \"fetus.\" Which begs the question,... if a child is a child even as a fetus,... and even before they are delivered from their mother,... when then was he or she actually \"born?\n \n That is,... when did they \"come into existence\" as a uniquely new human organism? \n \n The answer is \"conception.\"\n \n So, as someone reads the 5th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution with all that in mind, it's easy to see that the framers were intent on fixing \"citizenship\" to the point of which a child is \"born\" (delivered from it's mother.) And it is just as easy to see that the framers were intent on protecting a \"person's\" right to their life from the moment their life begins. \n \n At the time (200 plus years ago) that was also thought to be when the child was delivered from it's mother.\n \n We know better than they did now. (via technology, ultrasound, dna, microbiology, embryology, aging, etc)\n \n I wonder what the framers would think about all this? They wrote; ...\"... nor shall any person be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law..;\" and the words; \"... \"nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. \"\n \n How would they react to someone using the Constitutional requirments for \"citizenship\" to deny an entire class of children their \"personhood?\"\n \n It boggles the mind.",
