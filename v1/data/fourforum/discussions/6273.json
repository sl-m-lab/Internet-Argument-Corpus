And fuel prices were such that most did not care. Now that fuel has increased 200% in cost in about a decade, people are changing. And the US mfgrs - with no real nonSUV product - are paying the price.\n \n Much of GM's junk status has to do w/their moronic dealings w/the union. EVERY vehicle GM produces costs $1500 for just the health insurance premiums, and every year it gets worse (not to mention every % of mkt share lost). Ford has it bad as well on that front, just not as much. Add to that the fact that GM is killing off their new car designs to shore up the SUVs w/a quick redesign release the next 2 years, and their future is bleak. They will not disappear from a bankruptcy, but they will be smaller than Toyota (and maybe even Ford) when they come back.",
