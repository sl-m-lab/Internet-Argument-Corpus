   "...that says the attorney client privilege of silence does not apply in cases involving wrongful conviction or murderers.\n \n Recently, a man that has been in prison for over twenty years was released after the natural death of the real killer.\n \n It seems the real killer's lawyers knew who did it but would not come forward because of their attorney/client relationship with the real killer. When that man, the real killer died, they came forward and obtained the release of the falsely convicted man who had spent 29 years in prison for a murder he did not commit. Two \"officers of the court\" withheld the truth in observance of their questionable loyalty to their client, a true killer.\n \n There ought to be a law change. I contend that good ethics regarding murder cases should include an unblocked path to exposure of the truth, no matter who discovers it. Attorney client privilege should be trumped by the intended purpose of our legal system to protect the innocent and to identify the guilty, particularly where an innocent person has been convicted of murder.",

   "Just curious, would you hold the members of the jury which convicted the individual personally liable in this situation?\n\n \n Possibly, however if the prosecutor was withholding or manipulating evidence, then they were conned into convicting the innocent man (I cite the duke rape case, even though they weren't convicted).\n \n \n \n \nPlease understand that I am not challenging your POV; I'm asking where the responsibility lies, assuming, of course, that the evidence was not tainted and that the Rules of Criminal Procedure were scrupulously followed.\n\n \n Whoever is responsible should compensate the wrongly convicted, whoever that may be. The point is that they should be compensated, which they are presently not.",

   "I can agree that lawyers should be bound to confidence with their client's statements in efforts to defend that client from prosecution's charges. I'm not sure I agree they should allow an obvious travesty of justice to harm someone else. It seems there could be provisions in the system for allowing the information to exhonerate the falsely convicted without harming the one actually guilty.\n \n This is a case where there should be no doubt that a person was wrongfully sent to prison and deprived of years of his freedom in order to protect the man that actually committed the crime.\n\n \n I knew about this story and find it very disturbing that this black man had to waste away in Prison for 26 years until these lawyers lived out their natural lives and finally died before he could find justice in America. Why couldn't one of those lawyers have come forward, let's say a year later, and told the Court that in the course of doing their job they came across evidence that for reasons of client/lawyer confidentiality couldn't be shared publicly, but that he knew beyond any shadow of a doubt that the convicted man was innocent. \n \n Could that tactic have worked in your opinion? While protecting the rights of his guilty client and also speaking up for the innocence of the wrongly convicted man? It just seems such a travesty and would haunt me forever if I knew that I had to wrongly spend 26 years in Prison due to a confidentiality agreement that protected a murderer and insured that he would remain free while I served his sentence. No amount of compensation could mitigate such a travesty of justice, in my opinion.",

If the BAR association were to file a motion to review the evidence and trial transcript, stating that they had confidental information exonerating the accused, then be an added safety net could be used and still maintain lawyer / client privlages. If the case proves to be air tight, then a seven year statue of limitations could apply, providing the murderer steps foward.",
