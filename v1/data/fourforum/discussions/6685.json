In 4,543 words this document describes the structure of the government and the rights of the American people. No law may be passed that contradicts its principles and no person, or the government, is exempt from following it. This is why it is commonly called the \"supreme law of the land\".\n \n The purpose of the government is found in the Preamble. For the government to be successful, the Founding Fathers established three main principles on which our Government is based:\n \n * Inherent rights -- rights that anyone living in America has\n * Self government -- government by the people\n * Separation of powers -- branches with different powers\n \n Through time this document has worked, it has only been amended 27 times. The document is known as a \"living document\" because it can be amended. The Constitution is a document strong enough for safety and at the same time it is flexible enough to allow for freedom.\n \n The Constitution is organized into three parts:\n \n * Preamble - describes the purpose of the document and government\n * Articles - establish how the government is structured and how the Constitution can be changed. There are seven articles.\n * Amendments - changes to the Constitution; the first ten are called the Bill of Rights\n \n To learn more, choose from the following:\n \n * The Constitution of the United States\n * About the Constitution\n * History of the Constitution\n * Text of the Constitution\n \n \n A service of the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office.",

It has nothing to do with any one group or ideology--it's because the far left is very much out of the mainstream and so they have these conspiracy theories that America is being controlled by some dark shadowy movement. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n If liberals had their way and every political agenda-driven card-carrying member of the \"religious right\" suddenly disappeared, nothing would really change that much.

BTW, Madeline O'Hare was murdered a few years ago.\n \n \n \n \nAnd heaven forbid that the inequitable treatment of women should ever enter public consciousness...\n\n I'm only 37 but I remember the venom that spewed out of the mouths of the feminazis like \"men suck,\" and \"marriage is slavery.\" I think that the gender roles have been so blurred that it's pathetic.\n \n \n \n \nNow here, suh, you have an advantage over me. Please explain what NOW, NARAL, etc are, and how mothers have been exploited by them.\n\n OK, those groups never give the total truth concerning abortion at their death mills. The abortion industry is totally unregulated and rakes in alot of money. Also, those same groups never encourage other options like adoption.\n \n \n \n \nJust how is heterosexual marriage threatened by a redefinition to include same-sex couples? I've been married 34 years. Am I to assume my marriage is somehow undermined if the gay couple down the street formalise their union? Please explain why.\n\n Because the very foundation of this country is threatened, when you redefine family and marriage.",

   "Good Morning People.\n \n Trebor, here is a fact or two. \n \n \n \nThe Anvil that Has Worn Out Many Hammers\n \n Nineteenth century writer H.L. Hastings once forcibly illustrated the unique way in which the Bible has withstood the attacks of skepticism:\n \n \"Infidels of eighteen hundred years have been refuting and overthrowing this book, and yet it stands today as solid rock. Its circulation increases, and it is more loved and cherished and read today than ever before. Infidels, with all their assaults, make about as much impression on this book as a man with a tack hammer would on the Pyramids of Egypt.\n \n \"When the French monarch proposed the persecution of Christians in his dominion, an old statesman and warrior said to him, 'Sire, the church of God is an anvil that has worn out many hammers.' So the hammers of infidels have been pecking away at this book for ages, but the hammers are worn out, and the anvil still endures. If this book had not been the book of God, men would have destroyed it long ago. Emperors and popes, kings and priests, princes and rulers have all tried their hand at it; they die and the book still lives.\"\n \n \"No other book has been so chopped, knived, sifted, scrutinized, and vilified. What book on philosophy or religion or psychology or belles lettres of classical or modern times has been subject to such a mass attack as the Bible? With such venom and skepticism? With such thoroughness and erudition? Upon every chapter, line and tenet? The Bible is still loved by millions, and studied by millions. \n \n \n \n \n \nQuote:\n The Bible is the most well-known book in the history of the world, and no book has been attacked more than it. Skeptics have tried to destroy the authority of the Bible for the last eighteen hundred years. It has undergone every kind of scrutiny possible from archaeology, science, philosophy, and computers. Yet, despite all these attacks, the Bible proves itself to be true again and again. Each time the skeptics have been wrong, and the Bible has proven itself true. Just the fact that the Bible has remained steadfast in its authority after two thousand years is another piece of evidence supporting its divine origin.\n \n \n http://www.probe.org/content/view/39/77 \n \n \n Phunting, Why?\n \n Why do you feel the need to twist the truth. Abraham is justified by Faith\n \n Romans 4 1 What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather, discovered in this matter? 2 If, in fact, Abraham was justified by works, he had something to boast about-but not before God. 3 What does the Scripture say? \"Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.\"\n \n \n \n It is through faith, that we have any righteousness. \n \n \n \n \n Ephesians 2:\n 8 For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God-- 9 not by works, so that no one can boast.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Isaiah 64:5\n You meet him who rejoices and does righteousness,\n Who remembers You in Your ways.\n You are indeed angry, for we have sinned--\n In these ways we continue;\n And we need to be saved.\n 6 But we are all like an unclean thing,\n And all our righteousnesses are like filthy rags;\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Romans 3:\n 10 As it is written: \n \"There is no one righteous, not even one; \n 11 there is no one who understands, \n no one who seeks God. \n 12 All have turned away, \n they have together become worthless; \n there is no one who does good, \n not even one.\"\n \n \n \n Philippians 3:9\n and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ--the righteousness that comes from God and is by faith. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Titus 3:4-7\n 4 But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared, 5 he saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit, 6 whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior, 7 so that, having been justified by his grace, we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life.",

Its not an argument but purely circular reasoning to a non beleiver.\n \n Having more than vague familiarity with Scriptures and its many interpretations rule out a perfectly clear human-god. The fact of apparent lack of involvement alone in todays world causes trouble - way I see it, if God is not perfectly clear to others, he may not be perfectly clear to you. For something as apparently important as your immortal soul this seems somewhat reckless on behalf of God if he cared about everyone.\n \n More I learn about how the human body works, the less I can beleive in a designer. Its almost impossible to live forever without becoming post-human by just correcting apparent flaws the design.

   "So say you. Many of those quotes say nothing about after salvation. They say that salvation is attained through works. Stop trying to twist the Bible's words to get it to say what you want it to.\n\n \n You need to quit being superficial and do your homework. Here's something to help you out on all this:\n \n JUSTIFICATION\n \n Justification: \"1: the act, process, or state of being justified by God; 2. the act or an instance of justifying.\" (Webster 628)\n \n Justification: \"To justify or make just, by which sanctification is included under justification; to set right; correct a wrong thing done; to deem right or approve. Justification is, in Pauline language, synonymous with reconciliation. God is not imputing to men their trespasses, but declaring them righteous. The means (of justification) is the vicarious expiatory death of Jesus Christ. The sole condition is faith ... in Jesus Christ.\" (Hastings 510)\n \n Justification: \"To prove or show to be just; to vindicate as right; to declare free from guilt or blame; to absolve, to clear; to pardon or clear from guilt; to acquit; declare righteous; pronounce sentence of acceptance.\" (Conner 269) Conner goes on to quote J.R. Gregory (\"The Theological Student\"), who defines justification as, 'That act of God by which He accepts as righteous the penitent sinner who believes on Christ for salvation.\"\n \n With the above definitions and quotes as our starting point, we can now delve into one of the most dynamic and unselfish works in the history of creation - the work of Jesus Christ, who became our righteousness because we had none of our own. Author Kevin Conner explains it this way:\n \n \"When Adam sinned, all that he was and all that he did was 'imputed' to the whole, unborn human race. Sin left a debit on the books (Genesis 3:1-16; 2:17; Romans 5:12; 6:23). In Adam all sinned, and all died, spiritually and physically (I Corinthians 15:22). When Christ died on Calvary, the sin of Adam and the whole human race was 'imputed,' or put to Christs' account. And because God imputed our sin to Christ, He suffered our penalty, which was death. All our liabilities were transferred to Him....(and) Christ's righteousness was 'imputed' to us. His righteousness is credited to us, put to our account (Psalm 32:8; Romans 4:8). Justification pronounces the sinner legally innocent, freeing him from condemnation.\" (Conner 272) \n \n Romans chapters 3-4 contain the magnificent statements of justification for those who place their faith in Jesus Christ. Romans 3:21-22 states:\n \n \"But now a righteousness from God, apart from (observing) the\n law, has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets\n testify. This righteousness from God comes through faith in\n Jesus Christ to all who believe.\"\n \n A few sentences later, Paul declares, \"For we maintain that a man is justified (righteous in the eyes of God) by faith apart from observing the law.\" (Romans 3:28)\n \n In reviewing the tenets of covenant theology, we again go back to the hopeless condition of man after Adam's fall in the garden of Eden. Mankind had fallen into sin, and any meaningful, eternal communion with the Lord was gone. Not only was man mired in his sin with no means of extrication, but his normal, carnal disposition precluded his even desiring to seek after God (Romans 3:11). Only God had the power to set man right, and He chose to do it through the Mediator of the New Covenant, His Son, Jesus Christ. \n \n In Systematic Theology, Wayne Grudem makes the point that, \"the word 'justify' in the Bible indicates that justification is a legal declaration by God. Paul says, \"Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies; who is to condemn?\" (Romans 8:33-34). Grudem continues, \"In God's legal declaration of justification, He specifically declares that we are just in His sight. This (legal) declaration involves two aspects. First, it means that we have no penalty to pay for sin, including past, present, and future sins. The second part of justification is that God must declare us not to be merely natural in His sight but actually to be righteous in His sight. In fact, He must declare us to have the merits of perfect righteousness before Him.\" (Grudem 724-25)\n \n When considering the implications of legal declarations, we have to acknowledge that there is a substantial body of judicial law which was given to us by God. I'm speaking, of course, not only of the Ten Commandments, which comprises the moral law, but also the civil and ceremonial laws of the Old Testament. This 'weighty' and seemingly inflexible array of commandments can surely be viewed as a burdensome yoke of oppression for humanity. In Old and even New Testament times, man considered his salvation as being inexorably linked to his 'keeping' of the law. To the degree that he kept the Lord's rules and regulations, that was the degree to which he calculated his chances of salvation. Yet the keeping of the law was and is an exercise in futility. In Galatians 3:10-11, Paul addresses this contentious issue:\n \n \"All who rely on observing the law are under a curse, for it is\n written: 'Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do every-\n thing written in the Book of the Law.' Clearly, no one is justified\n before God by the law, because, 'The righteous will live by\n faith.\" \n \n The law was powerless to justify anyone righteous in the eyes of God for the simple reason that no mortal human was able to keep the law.\n \n \"There is no one righteous, not even one...no one who seeks God.\n There is no one who does good, not even one.\" (Romans 3:10-11)\n \n \"I declare to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he\n is obligated to obey the whole law.\" (Galatians 5:3)\n \n One might sweat out an entire lifetime trying to keep only one of God's laws, much less all of them. No, keeping the law was not the way to justification. The law had four major purposes:\n \n 1. It shows us the moral character of God\n 2. It serves as a tutor to lead us to Christ.\n 3. It is a guide for Christian living.\n 4. Knowing the law can keep us from suffering the adverse consequences of sin.\n \n SELF- JUSTIFICATION IN SCRIPTURE\n \n It seems clear from scripture that there are only two possible sources of obtaining justification: from one's own self, or from an outside source. Mark chapter 10 gives us an illustration of one man's attempt to justify himself before God (before Jesus). A rich young man is asking Jesus what he must do to inherit eternal life. In verse 18 Jesus responded by stating, \"Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.\" Jesus goes on to list a number of the Ten Commandments as the standard by which the young man must measure his actions. The young man remarked, \"Teacher, all these I have kept since I was a boy.\" To which Jesus then said, \"One thing you lack. God, sell everything you have and give it to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.\" The story ends when the young man's face fell and he went away sad, because he had great wealth. \n \n There are a number of lessons in this story. One of these was that the young man was trying to justify himself before Jesus by indicating he was \"keeping the law,\" when in reality he was in violation of the commandment not to make for one's self any idols. Money was the young man's idol, and thus he had already broken the law. Perhaps some other young man might have listened to Jesus reciting the commandments and come to realize that not only could he not keep them in the future, but he had already broken many of them in the past. The conversation might well have then taken a different turn. He might have said something like, \"Teacher, I confess that I have not kept the whole law, and I guess I need to be truthful and tell you that I don't think I can keep it in the future either. What then can I do?\" I'm fairly sure that Jesus would have told him to believe in Him, and then he will receive eternal life. One other note: later in the story of the rich young man Jesus noted that, \"It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.\" When the disciples asked, \"Who then can be saved?\" Jesus responded by saying, \"With man this is impossible, but not with God. With God, all things are possible\" (v. 27). The crux of the message was that it is impossible for a rich man to justify himself, especially when he is engaging in idol worship. Though man might possess great wealth, and achieve tremendous influence in the worldly system, he still has two major problems: one, he still is unable to keep the law; and two, he is completely helpless in justifying himself before God - he needs divine assistance. Only God can justify a person righteous. And it's not by the works of man that this is achieved, but by God's grace through faith in Jesus Christ (Ephesians 2:8-9).\n \n Two other examples of men seeking to justify themselves before God can be found in Luke 16:15 and 18:11. It is from these types of Biblical references that the Bible paints an exceedingly clear picture that man, of himself, has no means of self-justification. Only God is able to perform that work. \n \n PAUL AND JAMES - Are they in agreement with each other?\n \n Much has been said over the years about salvation, justification, and works, and their relationship to each other. I think it is best to look at this from a chronological perspective, starting with the words of the apostle Paul in Ephesians 2:8-9:\n \n \"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith - and this\n not from yourselves, it is the gift of God - not by works, so that\n no one can boast.\"\n \n Paul makes the following points:\n \n 1. You are saved by (God's) grace through faith (in Jesus Christ).\n 2. This salvation did not originate from yourselves.\n 3. It is the gift of God (therefore it cannot be earned).\n 4. This salvation is not by any type of works that a man can perform.\n \n \n Back in Romans chapter 4, Paul gave an illustration from Genesis 15:6 concerning Abraham's justification:\n \n \n \"If, in fact, Abraham was justified by works, he had something\n to boast about - but not before God. What does the scripture\n say? 'Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as\n righteousness.\" (Romans 4:2-3)\n \n Now, going forward to James chapter 2 we read:\n \n \"What good is it, my brothers, if a man claims to have faith but\n has no deeds (works)? Can such faith save him? Faith, by\n itself, if it is not accompanied by action (works - KJV), is dead.\n You foolish man, do you want evidence that faith without deeds\n is useless? Was not our ancestor Abraham considered righteous\n for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar? You\n see, a person is justified by what he does and not by faith alone.\"\n \n James is clearly referring to Genesis chapter 22 as the point where Abraham was justified righteous. What we see here is an illustration that James uses to answer those people who are claiming to have saving faith but no works. Specifically, he states, \"Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to him, 'Go, I wish you well; keep warm and well fed,' but does nothing about his physical needs, what good is it? (what good is that man's faith?)\" In effect, James is saying, \"You claim to have faith? You claim that God has saved you, put His Holy Spirit in you, and sealed you for redemption? You claim all these things and yet you let the poor go without food or clothes? What kind of a faith is that? I, James, will tell you quite frankly that if you possess the kind of saving faith that results in regeneration and changes a person's life, the Holy Spirit will do a work in you and cause you to follow the Lord's decrees (Ezekiel 36:27) and feed and clothe the poor.\" \n \n Well, what then does Paul state about works as proof that a person's life is changed? Perhaps not surprisingly, he agrees with James:\n \n \"I preached that they should repent and turn to God and prove\n their repentance by their deeds.\" (Acts 26:20)\n \n \n So why did Paul state in Ephesians that a person is saved by grace through faith, and not by works? And why did he refer to Genesis 15:6 as the point of Abraham's justification and not Genesis 22? \n \n Initial saving faith is the precursor to works. Abraham was not saved (justified righteous) by performing works, he was performing works because he first was saved and regenerated. Works is the result of our regeneration and salvation, not the cause of it. Faith by grace is the antecedent of works. It chronologically occurs first. Once the Holy Spirit indwells a believer at the point of salvation, He starts the process of progressive sanctification (see section on sanctification), and one of the effects of the indwelling Spirit is that of causing, or compelling a person, by a change of heart and mind, to perform works of a Christian nature. James' argument addresses that time period of a person's life, following true salvation and regeneration, when good works is supposed to be in evidence. He is saying, \"Now that you claim to be saved, we should be seeing some good works out of you. However, if these good works are not apparent, then your initial faith was probably not genuine, and you were never, either in the eyes of God, nor in the eyes of man, justified righteous.\" \n \n Another way to illustrate this is to consider the thief on the cross next to Jesus - the one who stated, \"Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.\" Then Jesus responded by saying, \"I tell you the truth, today you will be with me in paradise\" (Luke 23:42-43). It was at this particular moment that the repentant thief received his salvation, and was justified righteous in the eyes of God. This particular moment would also coincide with Genesis 15:6, when Abraham believed God and it was credited (imputed to his account) as righteousness, and would also coincide with what Paul stated in Ephesians 2:8-9. Note that there is no evidence that the thief had performed any good works in his life. To the contrary, his works were more of a criminal nature than a Godly nature. That was the very reason he was being crucified. Even as he initially hung from his cross, he heaped insults on the Lord (Mark 15:32). But then the sky darkened, his pain and suffering magnified, and the words Jesus spoke on the cross hit their appointed target, and the thief had a change of heart and believed on the Lord. At that point, the thief received his salvation and justification. \n \n Now, if by some means the thief could have come down from the cross, prior to death, and continued on with his life, then eventually his saving faith would have produced good works (corresponding to Abraham in Genesis 22 and James chapter 2). There is a progression whereby salvation leads to good works. In the eyes of God, Abraham was genuinely justified righteous in Genesis 15:6. Because his faith was genuine, it produced his works in Genesis 22, whereby he was seen as being justified righteous in the eyes of men. James and Paul, though they approach the issue of justification from two different points in time and two different perspectives (the perspective of God and the perspective of man), nevertheless are in total agreement with each other.\n \n DEAD FAITH, SAVING FAITH\n \n Still another issue that coincides with James 2:14-26 involves the issue of faith. James' contention is that for faith to be real, it must at some point result in works of a Godly nature. James is therefore speaking of the type of faith that justifies a man righteous, and the type of faith that doesn't. These are sometimes referred to as \"living\" faith, and \"dead\" faith. First, we will examine the issue of \"dead\" faith. Scripture records a number of verses that speak of this kind of faith:\n \n \"Faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead faith.\"\n (James 2:17)\n \n \"Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel (of Jesus\n Christ)...by which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what\n I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.\"\n (I Corinthians 15:1-2)\n \n \"You believe (have faith) that there is one God? Good! Even the\n demons believe that - and shudder.\"\n \n A man may claim to have faith. He may have declared his faith in Jesus Christ, been confirmed in the church, been baptized, and even attends church regularly. But a man with dead faith has no Spirit-wrought love for his fellow man - his works, if any, are born out of the human spirit as opposed to having been generated by the Holy Spirit. His faith is hollow, empty, and dead. It may just have been more of an intellectual assent that Jesus Christ is real, rather than a heart-felt belief and surrender to His will. For example, you might find those in academia who investigate historical documents for encyclopedias, and who, through exhaustive research, have determined in their minds and writings that Jesus Christ was a real person. They might even say, \"Yes, I believe in Jesus Christ.\" Yet they have not accepted Him as their savior, nor surrendered their life to Him, so their \"faith\" is more of an intellectual acceptance than a heart-felt conversion. Their faith is more a matter of statement than a matter of behavior. They still reside on the thrones of their lives, rather than surrendering all to Jesus. In Luke 9:23 Jesus states,\n \n \"If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and\n take up his cross daily and follow me.\"\n \n The man with dead faith is one who, day in and day out, does his own will, and lives for himself: \"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven\" (Matthew 7:21). Dead faith cannot result in eternal salvation.\n \n Living faith, on the other hand, is a life-changing faith. Man is \"born again,\" regenerated into the likeness of Christ. Man will no longer have a continued fascination with materialism, carnality, and worldly pursuits. A living faith involves the process of progressive sanctification, where the pursuit of God takes on supreme importance in the person's life, and the refiner's fire starts to purge the earthly influence from the believer's life. As time progresses, the believer surrenders more and more of his life to Christ, daily discovering new areas that previously had not been surrendered. His faith in God grows. The more he reads the Bible, the greater revelation of Christ he sees. He becomes more cognizant of any sin there many be in his life. He starts loving the things God loves, and hating the things God hates. \n \n In concluding this, I think it best to place in proper context the significance of works as it relates to salvation (justification), which is most clearly expressed in I Corinthians 3:11-15:\n \n \"For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ. If any man builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or straw, his work will be shown for what it is, because the day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each man's work. If what he has built survives, he will receive his reward. If it is burned up, he will suffer loss; he himself will be saved, but only as one escaping through the flames.\" \n \n \n The Full Life Study Bible provides these remarks on the above passage: \n \n \"HE WILL SUFFER LOSS: There is a future judgment for believers (I John 4:17) as to the degree of their faithfulness to God and the grace given to them during this life on earth (v.10; 4:2-5; 2 Cor.5:10). In that judgment there is the possibility that a believer, although receiving salvation, may experience great loss (Greek zemloo, meaning 'to suffer loss or damage'). The careless believer is in danger of suffering loss or damage in the following ways: (1) a feeling of shame at Christ's coming (2 Ti. 2:15; 1 John 2:28); (2) loss of his or her life's work for God (vv. 12-15); (3) loss of glory and honor before God (cf. Romans 2:7); (4) loss of opportunity for service and authority in heaven (Mt. 25:14-30); (5) a low position in heaven (Mt. 25:14-30); (6) loss of rewards (cf. v. 14-15); and (7) repayment for the wrong done to others (Col. 3:24-25).\n \n AS ONE ESCAPING THROUGH THE FLAMES: 'Escaping through the flames' is probably an expression meaning 'barely saved.' God will evaluate the quality of life, influence, teaching, and work in the church of each person. If his work is judged unworthy, he will lose his (heavenly) reward, yet he himself will be saved.\" ( Full Life 1755-56)\n \n Godly works do not result in justification, but are directed towards the edification and salvation of others and the Glory of God, and eventually result in some type of heavenly rewards. For those who may have been saved just prior to death (the thief on the cross), there may not be any works to reward, yet their salvation is yet assured. It is my contention that once a person is regenerated, eventually, if they live long enough, there should be some sort of Godly works in their life (James chapter 2).",
