   "Creationists tend to argue that evolution is an isolated science, without inputs from chemistry, physics, geology, hydrology, astronomy, etc. That argument is simply false. I will provide several examples of sciences that are used outside of evolution that use the same techniques and methods to bring us things as simple as water to as complicated as nuclear power. Many of these examples are either copied directly from or paraphrased from one of my recent discussions with PHDs chemists, University Professors, professional geologists and other practicing scientists.\n \n Let's start.\n \n Population genetics is based entirely upon Evolutionary concepts and is used extensively in plant and animal breeding. Genetic engineering would not be possible without knowledge of the theory of evolution.\n \n The Evolutionary concept of common decent allows us to make paternity and relatedness determinations using DNA testing, and this is used in medicine for genetic counseling, in law enforcement in detective work, and in civil legal court to determine paternity of children. The actual testing techniques used, incidentally, are the same ones research scientists use in their Evolutionary Biology work.\n \n Of course, machines, floor plans, and computer programs are being designed using genetic algorithms these days. This, literally, uses evolution to make stuff better than we can design it.\n \n Credits to Nator\n \n First, geology is not only used to find deposits of oil and natural gas, it is also used to evaluate the extent and recharge rates of confined aquifers. Now if it would be difficult to live without oil and gas, as we might have to under the principles of creationist geology, imagine what it would be like to live without fresh water. That is what would happen to all arid and semi-arid places on earth without groundwater resources.\n \n The link between the current understanding of subsurface hydrology and evolution concerns the age of the water at a given point in a confined aquifer. The water in some confined aquifers is in the order of millions of years old, which is known due to the fact that gravity can only pull so much water from the exposed part of the formation for a given length through rocks of varying transmissivity. This means that technically any fossils in such a rock with water at a given age must be older than the water in the rock, which would provide a minimum age for the fossil.\n \n Now if we were to abandon hydrology as a scientific branch of geology and replace it with YEC hydrology, the inability to understand how much water is available in a confined aquifer, and more importantly, how long it takes to replenish that water, may lead to disastrous and unforeseen consequences when the well runs dry.\n \n Now as to nuclear power and nuclear bombs, it is obvious that they are made of radioactive materials. It is just as obvious that radioactive materials are used in radiometric dating. Therefore, the same scientific understanding of radioactivity present in chemistry and physics that is used to make nuclear power is the one used to date the strata around fossils and help make sense of geologic time along with evolution as per paleontology.\n \n Credits to anglagard\n \n I will add more as I get more, but feel free to add any examples you can think of.",

Meanwhile, that staunchly, republican, bible belt industry of the oil businesses have no time for abiogenic theory of oil. It would seem that the proof is on the pudding - no company explores on abiogenic oil concepts, and the pudding is the US bible heartland.",
