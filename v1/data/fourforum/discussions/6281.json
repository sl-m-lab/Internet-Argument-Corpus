   "Like I said, save that cyber-dysentary for someone who believes it.\n\n \n \n Projecting??\n \n \n\n Psychological projection (or projection bias) can be defined as unconsciously assuming that others share the same or similar thoughts, beliefs, values, or positions on any given subject. According to the theories of Sigmund Freud, it is a psychological defense mechanism whereby one \"projects\" one's own undesirable thoughts, motivations, desires, feelings -- basically parts of oneself -- onto someone else (usually another person, but psychological projection onto animals and inanimate objects also occurs). The principle of projection is well-established in psychology.\n \n An illustration would be an individual (Alice, for example) who feels dislike for another person (let's say Bob), however her unconscious mind will not allow her to become aware of this negative emotion. Instead of admitting to herself that she feels dislike for Bob, she projects her dislike onto Bob, so that her conscious thought is not \"I don't like Bob,\" but \"Bob doesn't seem to like me.\" In this way you can see that projection is related to denial, the only other defense mechanism that is more primative than projection. Alice has denied a part of herself, and in order to deny it she projects that part onto another, namely Bob. Another, and an ironic, example is if Alice were to say, \"Bob seems to project his feelings onto me.\" \n \n",

I've been plugging away at the gospels' poor standing as evidence for a supernatural miracle-working risen-from-the-dead Jesus, and he may well have meant simply that they are evidence that a preacher of that name once existed.\n \n Messiahs, whether self-proclaimed or acclaimed by others, were not rare in the centuries either side of 0 CE, and it's entirely likely that there was at least one called Y'shua. I quote from http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/online_messiahs.htm, itself a condensation of The Jewish Messiahs by Harris Lenowitz (Oxford University Press, 2001):\n \n \nRescue from subjection to an imposing culture within which the Jewish communities are entrapped is never achieved. This is the overarching theme from the first messiah events of the century preceding the messiah Jesus of Nazareth to the latest event, that of the messiah Rebbe Menahem Mendel Schneersohn of Crown Heights in New York City. In the events themselves, the messiah is almost invariably held in prison for some time and, not infrequently, the accounts represent him as escaping from his bonds and captors. Sometimes the escape is a fantasy: release through death or simply disappearance, occultation. Certain details in the accounts-promises of eternal youth, freedom from illness, etc., a \"new heaven over a new earth\"-symbolize just how unattainable the political and economic liberation actually is and indicate that the events themselves possess primarily symbolic meaning.\n\n \n In other words the Jesus described in the christian gospels, if he existed, was far from a unique figure.

Yet liberals often refuse to accept the Bible as evidence. Why is that? Especially since archaology uncovers places from the Bible from time to time? (http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05221/550792.stm)\n\n \n I assume by \"liberals\" you meant skeptics or non-Christians. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n Interesting thread so far, though I think the actual topic is rather cut and dried.\n \n The Bible is evidence for a historical figure named Jesus, it's just not very strong evidence. The reasons for that should be plainly obvious to anyone. \n \n It is NOT evidence for Jesus being divine or the son of God, and it no way represents PROOF that Jesus the historical figure existed or was divine.\n \n As for a there being a bias against Christianity when it comes to ancient historical texts, be they religious or not, I think that's largely a matter of one's own perception, not reality. If anything, IMHO, the Bible is given far greater importance as a historical document than it deserves due to the influence of Christianity on history, and today's world.\n \n Waxy",

   "If I may revisit the original topic:\n \n The bible in itself is a problematic source because it is inherently biased. It was written/collated by believers and is thus filled with that belief. In itself, its accounts are thus suspect. Other accounts must therefore be considered. These do indicate that something happened, that someone corresponding to Jesus existed, however, they mostly contradict the elements of the bilbe that indicate Jesus was special.\n \n To use the plane crash analogy:\n You are sitting at home, enjoying the view of surrounding forested hills, and all of a sudden, four dirty people in torn up clothes walk from the wood. They walk to you and say they are the survivors of a plane crash three hills away. They ask for some water, a shower, maybe a blanket or two. And, of course, a phonecall.\n It is not unreasonable to assume they were indeed in a crash, after all, some water, a sandwich and a blanket are not such a great risk while you call the local equivalent of emergency services. Planes fly all over the place all the time, crashed do happen, and the sound of a small plane crash may easily be missed, especially if you happened to be taking a nap three hours ago. However, this assumption has little negative effect, the difference between assuming they speak the truth and assuming they are lying is small: one litre of water, four sandwiches, four old blankets and four phonecalls.\n \n Now, you turn on the TV, but there is no news of missing planes. Confused, you take a look at the teletext page listings for the local airport and find out there are no flights scheduled for today. It certainly would make you wonder a bit, wouldn't it.\n \n Now, imagine you go back to work next morning at an insurance company. The same four come in and demand multimillion damages for injuries sustained in that crash. Wouldn't you call the airport about missing planes, flight routes, plane service records, hospital treatment confirmations and similar? You would demand far more solid proof. \n \n And what would you think if three days later, you spotted an e-bay ad for \"one small plane, good condition, low mileage\" posted by one of the four?",

If you disagree, what things do you disagree on?\n \n -Wez\n\n yes, this is the point im making. the bible isnt \"proof\" that jesus existed. but the fact that there are multiple accounts of jesus' life, despite the discrepancies and contradictions, is fairly strong evidence that jesus actually did exist\n \n i also agree with you that the reports of miraculous works and so on seem fictional. its no great stretch to believe that some guy named jesus lived in jerusalem about 2000 years ago, or that he was a self-proclaimed rabbi that got executed by crucifixion. all that seems consistent with the context of that time, and believable. just as we are pretty familiar with plane crashes as a common occurance, in those days a self-proclaimed charismatic rabbi riling up the crowds and then being executed for treason would likely be a common, or at least plausible occurance.\n \n the plausibility of him doing miraculous works, particularly through the power of God, is nill. if he had the ability to do anything spectacular, it would have been through trickery or visual illusions, similar to the \"magicians\" of our time. not only that, but if there were suc a thing as God-powered miracles then, there would be God-poered miracles today. and there arent.\n \n more likely, the descriptions of jesus' feats were exagerrations based on what the people of that time wanted to happen. most of what was recorded in the gospels originated from what would have been the \"urban legends\" of that time. with no \"snopes.com\" to check out the claims, whatever was rumored would be taken as true. quite clearly, anybody with such fanciful stories surrounding thier life would be worth writing about. i would imagine that the compilation of jesus' biography really became an interesting subject because the \"grass roots\" population of jerusalem made him a legend. to the lowest class, this guy would have been the best thing since bucket-drawn water, and though their belief (christianity) was more of an underground cult at the time, the \"official\" high-class record keepers of the day may have dismissed jesus as a minor nusance, common in any state that was under the roman empire. well, thats my theory anyway",

   "Wise preachers named Yeshua and similar are one thing, miracles are another.\n\n \n Have a miracle, Iuris: \n \n THE SUN DARKENED AT NOON\n \n Circa 750 B.C.\n \n According to Amos 1:1, Amos prophesied during the reigns of Uzziah, king of Judah (767-739 B.C.), and Jeroboam, king of Israel (782-753 B.C.). The name \"Amos\" is derived from the Hebrew term meaning, \"lift a burden,\" or \"burden-bearer\" (note Isaiah 9:4, speaking of the coming Messiah as one who would carry our burdens, and also Matthew 11:28). His calling by God was to foretell of pending judgments upon a number of surrounding nations, and particularly of a coming judgment upon Israel. As is common with other Biblical prophets, along with the promise of impending judgment, God also gave Amos a glimpse of events that would soon occur in the life of the coming Messiah, though the significance of what was prophesied may or may not have been made known to Amos. And so it is in the Old Testament book of Amos that we find a prophecy that for many centuries was looked upon with wonder and curiosity:\n \n \"'In that day,' declares the Sovereign Lord, 'I will make the sun go down at noon and darken the earth in broad daylight....I will make that time like mourning for an only son, and the end of it like a bitter day.'\" (Amos 8:9-10)\n \n It probably wasn't until the day of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ in 32 A.D. that the prophecy of Amos took on clarity and meaning, for in Matthew 27:45 Jesus had just been nailed to the cross when the Bible records:\n \n \"From the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land.\"\n \n Just as the \"Star of Bethlehem\" marked the birth of Christ, so now God brought forth another celestial miracle to pronounce His death. This prophecy is one of those that is beyond the control of mortal man, and as such it dispels the theory that Christ could have manipulated events so as to make it appear that He was the Messiah. But is there any evidence that this really occurred? Did the sun go dark at noonday? In his book, Evidence That Demands a Verdict (Volume 1, pages 81-87), Josh McDowell provides the following historical evidence that what took place at Calvary was more that just fanciful mythology:\n \n Concerning the Samaritan-born historian Thallus, circa 52 A.D: (The writings of Thallus no longer exist, yet were alluded to by the historian Julius Africanus, as follows): \"Thallus, in the third book of his histories, explains away this darkness as an eclipse of the sun - unreasonably, as it seems to me - unreasonably, of course, because a solar eclipse could not take place at the time of a full moon, and it was at the season of the Paschal full moon that Christ died.\"\n \n Likewise, Africanus wrote concerning the writings of another first century historian by the name of Phlegon: \"....during the time of Tiberius Caesar an eclipse of the sun occurred during the full moon.\" \n \n Phlegon is also mentioned by the historian Origen in his work, \"Contra Celsum,\" book 2, sections 14, 39, and 59: \"Phlegon mentioned the eclipse that took place during the crucifixion of the Lord Christ....and this is shown by the historical account itself of Tiberius Caesar.\" Apparently at one time there were historical accounts of the strange darkness that came over the land that were kept in the official archives of Tiberius Caesar, though they are likely lost to history.\n \n Finally, the 2nd century Roman born jurist and theologian Tertullian referred to a Roman archives report of an \"unexplained darkness that took place during the reign of Tiberius Caesar, as can be seen in the archives of Pontius Pilate.\"\n \n The darkness spoken of in the book of Matthew occurred between noon and three P.M. in the afternoon (from the sixth to the ninth hours, as the Jews were noted as referring to the sixth and the ninth hours of daylight). Note that a solar eclipse will take less than an hour to complete, and a total solar eclipse lasts just a few minutes. This, coupled with the fact that a solar eclipse cannot occur during a full moon (the moon would be on the 'other' side of the earth), provides further evidence that what occurred was something other than an eclipse of the sun. Just what it was no one can say for sure, just that from recorded historical sources there was a strange darkness during the time of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. From God's perspective, it surely was a time of mourning for His only begotten son. \n \n Jesus once said, \"I am the light of the world.\" So it shouldn't be surprising that during his death there might be a time of darkness over the land. \n \n REFERENCE: McDowell, Josh.

   "The Anvil that Has Worn Out Many Hammers\n \n Nineteenth century writer H.L. Hastings once forcibly illustrated the unique way in which the Bible has withstood the attacks of skepticism: \n \n \"Infidels of eighteen hundred years have been refuting and overthrowing this book, and yet it stands today as solid as a rock. Its circulation increases, and it is more loved and cherished and read today than ever before. Infidels, with all their assaults, make about as much impression on this book as a man with a tack hammer would on the Pyramids of Egypt. \n \n \"When the French monarch proposed the persecution of Christians in his dominion, an old statesman and warrior said to him, 'Sire, the church of God is an anvil that has worn out many hammers.' So the hammers of infidels have been pecking away at this book for ages, but the hammers are worn out, and the anvil still endures. If this book had not been the book of God, men would have destroyed it long ago. Emperors and popes, kings and priests, princes and rulers have all tried their hand at it; they die and the book still lives.\"\n \n \"No other book has been so chopped, knived, sifted, scrutinized, and vilified. What book on philosophy or religion or psychology or belles lettres of classical or modern times has been subject to such a mass attack as the Bible? With such venom and skepticism? With such thoroughness and erudition? Upon every chapter, line and tenet? The Bible is still loved by millions, and studied by millions.\n \n http://www.forerunner.com/forerunner/X0002_Anvil.html",

What I meant was that many factors are used to gauge wether a historic account is accurate or not. \n \n First of all one need to establish the identity of the original author. That is, his intentions for writing the book, his own personal and political beliefs, the amount of time passed between the actual event and when the text was written, what he chooses to include and exclude (and his reasons for it), wether the stories have a reason to be altered in any way, etc, etc. \n \n Then you have to consider the medium. In the case of the bible, one has to question what interpretation and edition we are reading and how it could have changed from edition to edition (once again the identity of the individual authors and translators needs to be examined).\n \n And finally, the historian would have to question his own beliefs and the dominant view of history and gauge wether this might have an impact on his interpretation of the text.\n \n I`m not an historian, so I`m pretty sure I`ve missed quite a few steps and some aspects or factors to consider.\n \n Needless to say, it is not as simple as merely accepting written words as accurate descriptions of reality...\n \n Generally speaking, the bible is litterature.

Personally, I think that many of the Hebrew-speaking people whose remains are contained in these ossuaries were among the first followers of Christ.... The appearance of Christianity at the very gates of Jerusalem is, in my opinion, extraordinary and unprecedented. Somehow the new [Christian] doctrine must have made its way into the Jewish system.... The association of the sign of the cross with (the name of Jesus) written in Hebrew alone constitutes a valuable fact.\" \n \n \"What gives additional value to these short inscriptions is that they furnish a whole series of names found in the Gospels, in their popular and local Syro-Chaldaic forms. The presence of the names of Jesus and Martha, of which we only knew historically that it was the feminine form of the Aramaic, would alone be sufficient to make this collection important from an exegetic point of view. By a singular coincidence, which from the first struck me forcibly, these inscriptions, found close to the Bethany road, and very near the site of the village, contain nearly all the names of the personages in the Gospel scenes which belonged to the place: Eleazar (Lazarus), Simon, Martha ... a host of other coincidences occur at the sight of all these most evangelical names.\" \n \n Italian scholar P. Bagatti discovered another catacomb holding 100 ossuaries on the western side of the Mount of Olives. Coins that were minted by Governor Varius Gratus (A.D. 16) showed that these tombs were used for burial of Christians before A.D. 70. The name of Jesus was found on ossuaries of priests found in the catacomb, indicating they were probably followers of Jesus.

   "Karen Armstrong is not discussing God; she is instead discussing religious fundamentalism.\n\n \n Did Jesus not have his own FUNDAMENTAL religious beliefs? And do not most people consider him a great teacher, if not a great God and Savior? What you have to watch out for, Orion, is extremist LIBERAL FUNDAMENTALISM (ala Karen Armstron and the apostate, liberal Bishop Spong), i.e.\n \n Liberal Fundamentalism is a failed and destructive philosophical enterprise, replete with a host of anti-Biblical, pseudo-religious doctrines, that seeks to elevate the ways and \"wisdom\" of man above the wisdom and desires of God. It's principle aim is the sacking of traditional Judaic and Christian values and beliefs, which are \"revisited\" through suspect liberal \"scholarship\" or politically-correct dogma in an effort to replace them with the tenets of carnal moral hedonism and the failed social doctrines of today's liberal elitists. Liberal Fundamentalists FEAR and despise any moral guidelines that would tweak their consciences and diminish their carnal hedonism.\n \n The genesis of today's liberal fundamentalists were the anti-traditionalist hedonists of the 1960's and 70's. They advocated fornication and \"free-love\", illegal substance abuse, moral relativism, contempt for authority, and enjoyed a prosperous America founded on the very hard work and enterprise they sought to distance themselves from. The freedoms they enjoyed were purchased by the blood, sweat, and tears and personal sacrifices of the very forefathers they held in contempt.\n \n Personal responsibility, self-restraint and self-sacrifice were foreign concepts to them. \"Right and wrong\", \"good and evil\" were arbitrarily revisited, for such concepts had no objective meaning to them. They had no objective rationality for their hedonistic philosophy other than it \"feels good, so let's do it\". The only righteous cause that qualified for support in their carnal minds was the undermining and revising of traditional American and Judeo-Christian values.\n \n One of the most revered mantras of the liberal fundamentalists is \"equality\". The net effect of this experiment was to elevate women via the degradation of men; promote racial equality by instituting racial-based preferences and reverse-discrimination; engender class warfare against people of means via the redistribution of wealth (a concept centered in greed for other people's money, rather than rely on one's own personal initiative and work ethic); and elevate wickedness (sodomy, fornication, and other corrupt lifestyles) to the plateau of respectability at the expense of traditional Godly values. \n \n Along with the failed liberal concept of equality was the mantra of liberal \"tolerance\".However, liberal tolerance is not what it appears to be. It is a corrupted partisan philosophical perspective with its own rigid set of dogmas. It assumes, for instance, a relativistic view of moral and religious knowledge. This assumption has shaped the way many people think about issues such as homosexuality, abortion rights, and religious truth claims, leading them to believe that a liberally tolerant posture concerning these issues is the correct one and that it ought to be reflected in our laws and customs. But this posture is often dogmatic, intolerant, and coercive, for it asserts that there is only one correct view on these issues, and if one does not embrace it, one may likely face public ridicule, demagogic tactics, and perhaps even legal reprisals. Liberal tolerance is therefore neither liberal nor tolerant.\" \n \n Rather than truly embrace \"freedom\", liberal fundamentalists seek to control virtually every aspect of the lives of the masses which are unfortunate enough to be under their fundamentalist rulership. They seek to outlaw SUV's, impose smoking bans while advocating marijuana use, prohibit freedom of religious expression in government and public schools, advocate compulsory training in politically correct opinions and attitudes, seek to enforce Bible bans in schools, embrace a de-facto litmus test against possible pro-life judicial nominees, seek to criminalize pro-life demonstrations through the RICO racketeering statute, seek to squelch religious speech via \"hate-speech\" laws, and generally engage in a whole range of behaviors designed to subvert the U.S. Constitution and traditional American values. Liberal Fundamentalist objective seeks nothing less than the ciminalization of our heritage, our Judeo-Christian values, all under the guise of eliminating \"prejudice\" and moral guidelines.\n \n Liberal fundamentalism undermines the basic effectiveness of the government, legislatures, and other societal elements of democracy. Despite the idealistic goals of liberalism, attempts to build a utopian liberal society in America have only led to heightened outbreaks of AIDS, VD, porno-related crime, social divisions, divorce, abortion, drug addictions, deficit spending, the welfare state, a crushing tax burden, the breakdown of the family unit, moral depravity, and numerous other such scourges which have resulted in enormous societal suffering and discontent. As a result, liberal fundamentalism is strongly associated with left-wing fanaticism, reverse-racism, anti-intellectualism, elitism, nihilism, godlessness, and societal violence.\"",

   "The Anvil that Has Worn Out Many Hammers\n \n Nineteenth century writer H.L. Hastings once forcibly illustrated the unique way in which the Bible has withstood the attacks of skepticism: \n \n \"Infidels of eighteen hundred years have been refuting and overthrowing this book, and yet it stands today as solid as a rock. Its circulation increases, and it is more loved and cherished and read today than ever before. Infidels, with all their assaults, make about as much impression on this book as a man with a tack hammer would on the Pyramids of Egypt. \n \n \"When the French monarch proposed the persecution of Christians in his dominion, an old statesman and warrior said to him, 'Sire, the church of God is an anvil that has worn out many hammers.' So the hammers of infidels have been pecking away at this book for ages, but the hammers are worn out, and the anvil still endures. If this book had not been the book of God, men would have destroyed it long ago. Emperors and popes, kings and priests, princes and rulers have all tried their hand at it; they die and the book still lives.\"\n \n \"No other book has been so chopped, knived, sifted, scrutinized, and vilified. What book on philosophy or religion or psychology or belles lettres of classical or modern times has been subject to such a mass attack as the Bible? With such venom and skepticism? With such thoroughness and erudition? Upon every chapter, line and tenet? The Bible is still loved by millions, and studied by millions.\n \n http://www.forerunner.com/forerunner/X0002_Anvil.html\n\n \n Could this be because so many hammers have ended up in the skulls of infidels?",
