   "If marriage between 1 man and 1 woman is considered the biblical standard and and anything else is not considered biblical then how does one explain Jacob, Leah, Rachel and the rest?\n \n The Story of Jacob and Rachel -- Genesis 29:1-30:24 (All True Bible Stories for Children)\n \n \n\n The Story of Jacob and Rachel\n Genesis 29:1-30:24\n On their way to the movies, Beth's father drove them through a very interesting part of Hollywood. There were many women in eye-catching clothing on the street, and Beth noticed that sometimes cars would pull up to the curb and the women would walk over to them. \n \"Who are those women talking to?\" Beth asked her mother from the back seat. \n \"Those women make their living by charging men money to put their penises in them, and the men are their customers,\" said Beth's mother. \"The men are asking the women how much they charge.\" \n Beth was upset and confused by this. \"But Mother,\" she said, \"isn't that kind of naughty?\" \n \"If you are asking whether it is bad to treat women like property and charge money for their favors, then not at all, Dear One,\" her mother said. \"In fact, I know a story from the Bible about just that sort of thing.\" \n And this is the story she told:\n \n One day, Jacob went on a journey to visit the people who live in the east. While he was walking, he saw a well covered by a big rock and surrounded by sheep. It turns out that shepherds liked to bring their sheep to the well to get them water. While Jacob was watching, some shepherds rolled the rock off the well, got water for their sheep, and rolled the rock back onto the well. \n Jacob walked up to the shepherds and said, \"Who are you guys?\" \n And the shepherds answered, \"We're shepherds from Haran.\" \n \"Do you know my Uncle Laban?\" Jacob asked. \n \"We sure do,\" answered the shepherds. \n \"How is he?\" asked Jacob. \n \"He's fine,\" answered the shepherds, adding, \"and look, here comes his daughter Rachel now with her sheep.\" \n \"Why don't you get water for your sheep and move along,\" said Jacob. \n \"It's not time yet,\" said the shepherds. \n While they were talking, Rachel walked up. \n When Jacob saw his cousin Rachel and her sheep, he rolled the rock off of the well and got some water for them. And when he was done, he kissed Rachel without asking first, yelled, and started crying. \n When he was done crying, Jacob said, \"Rachel, I'm your cousin.\" And Rachel ran away to tell her father all about it. \n Laban was so happy to hear that Jacob was visiting that he ran to the well to meet him and invite him to stay over. \n After Jacob had been living with Laban for a month, Laban said to him, \"I can't let you keep doing work around my house for nothing, Jacob. We're like brothers. How much would you like to be paid?\" \n This got Jacob to thinking. He knew that Laban had two daughters. The oldest daughter was named Leah, and she was not very pretty, although she had nice eyes. On the other hand, Rachel, the youngest daughter, was pretty and nice. In fact, Rachel was so pretty and nice that Jacob was in love with her. \n \"I know,\" said Jacob, \"I'll work for you for seven years and in return you will give me Rachel to marry.\" \n \"Better to you than to someone else,\" said Laban. \n The seven years passed quickly for Jacob because he was so in love with Rachel. When he was done earning Rachel, Jacob went to Laban and said, \"Give me my wife so that I can put my penis in her.\" \n So Laban got all the men in his house together and had a big party. That evening, he took Leah and brought her to Jacob with a piece of cloth over her head so that Jacob wouldn't know who she was. Jacob put his penis in her. \n The next morning, Jacob woke up and took the cloth off of Leah's head. \"Hey, what's going on here!\" he said, and he ran to see Laban. \n \"What did you do?\" Jacob asked Laban. \"I was supposed to get to put my penis in Rachel after working for seven years and you gave me Leah. Why did you trick me?\" \n \"Well,\" said Laban, \"It's a tradition around here that a girl cannot have a penis put in her until her older sister has had a penis put in her first. I'll make you another deal: Take a week off to put your penis in Leah some more, then I'll give you Rachel, too. But after that you have to work another seven years for me.\" \n \"Okay,\" said Jacob. \n So Jacob had sex with Leah for a week and then Laban gave him Rachel. Jacob put his penis in Rachel and loved her more than he loved Leah. He didn't mind having to work for Laban seven more years.\n \n \"I see,\" said Beth. \"So a man owns his daughters and can sell them to other men.\" \n \"That's right, Dear One,\" said her mother. \n \"So do those women's fathers sell them to the men in the cars?\" \n \"No, there is a man who takes care of selling whole bunches of women, even though they are not his daughters. He's called a'pimp.'\" \n \"I get it. So I guess that men always have to pay when they want to put their penis in a woman, right?\" Beth asked. \n \"No, not at all,\" her mother said. \"Let me tell you more of the story and you will see.\"\n \n God didn't think it was fair that Jacob loved Rachel more than he loved Leah, so God didn't let any babies grow in Rachel's tummy. Leah on the other hand made three sons named Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah before she stopped letting things grow inside her. \n When Rachel noticed that nothing was growing in her tummy, she got jealous of Leah. Rachel went to Jacob and said, \"If you don't make me have babies, I'm going to die.\" \n This made Jacob mad at Rachel. He said, \"What? Am I God? It's not my fault that nothing will grow in your tummy!\" \n Rachel said, \"I have an idea! Put your penis in my maid, Bilhah, while I'm in the room and if she has any children we'll say that they were mine.\" Then she gave Bilhah to Jacob for him to put his penis in. \n Babies started to grow in Bilhah's tummy, and made two sons before she was done. Rachel named the sons Dan and Naphtali. \n Because Rachel's plan had worked so well, Leah gave her maid, named Zilpah, to Jacob for him to put his penis in. Zilpah made two sons, and Leah named them Gad and Asher. \n Later on, Reuben was picking flowers and he brought them to his mother, Leah. Rachel saw the flowers and said, \"Can I have those?\" \n \"Hey!\" Leah said, \"Jacob pays more attention to you than he does to me. Why should I give you my son's flowers?\" \n \"Well,\" answered Rachel, \"if you give me the flowers, I'll tell Jacob to put his penis in you tonight.\" \n \"Okay,\" said Leah. \n That night, when Jacob got home from work, Leah ran out of the house to meet him. \"You have to put your penis in me,\" she said to Jacob, \"because I gave Rachel my son's flowers.\" That was a good enough reason for Jacob, so he put his penis in Leah. \n After that, God listened to Leah and let babies grow in her tummy. She made sons named Issachar and Zebulun. After that she decided to make a daughter named Dinah, too. \n When that was all over with, God remembered Rachel and let her grow a baby in her tummy. She made a son and named him Joseph.\n \n Beth thought about this for a moment. \"So, if you own a woman, you can give her to a man to put his penis in but if she has babies then they are yours,\" Beth said, thoughtfully. \"And you can also sell yourself to a man's wife so that you can have sex with her husband?\" \n \"Well,\" said her mother, \"it's a bit more complicated than that, but as you grow older, you will understand more.\" \n Then Beth smiled and smiled out the window at the women in their bright makeup and hot pants. The story had answered all her questions, and she took joy in watching women fulfilling the role that God had made for them.\n \n \n\n \n What about Abraham, Sarah, and Hagar?\n \n What about David, Jonathon, and David's many wives?\n \n What about Solamon and his wives?",

They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.\"\n \n Romans 1:26-27 - \"Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.\"\n \n 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 - \"Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.\"\n \n 1 Timothy 1:8-10 - \"But we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully, knowing this: that the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine...\"\n \n Jude 7 - \"In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion.

   "It's not a verse but a series of books which deal with moral and ceremonial laws. Here's a link which answers your question if you are willing to pay attention. Gods Bible 10 Commandments and the Ceremonial Law\n\n \n Well that threw me off a little. I wasn't expecting you to direct me to a site that (my words) believes the Catholic Church as close to the Antichrist as is possible, fears for people who have abandoned the Sabbath, is vocal concerning the Churches editing of God's law to name a few issues they have mostly with the RCC, both present and past before the various splits.\n \n The point though is the separation of the Law into moral and ceremonial is not based on anything biblical. This is something man made. The inclusion or exclusion of Laws that make up the ceremonial and moral also have no biblical basis, again being completely at the discretion of man.\n \n So no there is no biblical establishment of the ideas of Moral or Ceremonial Law nor is there any biblical basis as to which Torah Laws are included or excluded.\n \n If Christians choose to accept these concepts, that is their choice and I respect their decision to do so. My issue is when these man made laws are stated as being from God and therefore Christians feel justified in insisting they be followed by those who do not share their beliefs. \n \n Christians centuries ago decided which of God's laws they would be obligated to live by. Over time some of those laws of remained the same, some have been removed, replaced or modified to remain relevant in an ever changing world. There is no biblical basis for man to adhere to Christianity's Moral Law and Ceremonial Law concept. \n \n God, as Christians will say gave man free will to choose, but Christians seem intent on not permitting an individual to exercise that ability. If a person decides not to accept the Christian belief system, why won't the religion allow that? Some people do not wish to be obligated to a set of rules established so long ago or maybe they would like to observe rules that are more restrictive. Whatever the reason there is no reason that anyone should be punished or rewarded for maintaining these two concepts.",

   "Let's just put an end to this perversion of Gods word right now by telling this story in proper context as it is told in the bible. Just read the bolded and underlined in chapters 17 and 18 and you can see first of all that David was just a boy when he killed Goliath and met Jonathan and Saul. And the passages referring to Jonathan giving him his robe occurred when they were both just boys. \n 1Sa 17:1 Now the Philistines gathered their armies for battle; and they were gathered at Socoh which belongs to Judah, and they camped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.\n 1Sa 17:2 Saul and the men of Israel were gathered and camped in the valley of Elah, and drew up in battle array to encounter the Philistines.\n 1Sa 17:3 The Philistines stood on the mountain on one side while Israel stood on the mountain on the other side, with the valley between them.\n 1Sa 17:4 Then a champion came out from the armies of the Philistines named Goliath, from Gath, whose height was six cubits [fn] and a span.\n 1Sa 17:5 He had a bronze helmet on his head, and he was clothed with scale-armor which [fn] weighed five thousand shekels of bronze.\n 1Sa 17:6 He also had bronze greaves [fn] on his legs and a bronze javelin slung between his shoulders.\n 1Sa 17:7 The shaft of his spear was like a weaver's beam, and the head of his spear weighed six hundred shekels of iron; his shield-carrier also walked before him.\n 1Sa 17:8 He stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel and said to them, \"Why do you come out to draw up in battle array? Am I not the Philistine and you servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves and let him come down to me.\n 1Sa 17:9 \"If he is able to fight with me and kill [fn] me, then we will become your servants; but if I prevail against him and kill [fn] him, then you shall become our servants and serve us.\"\n 1Sa 17:10 Again the Philistine said, \"I defy the ranks of Israel this day; give me a man that we may fight together.\"\n 1Sa 17:11 When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid.\n 1Sa 17:12 Now David was the son of the [fn] Ephrathite of Bethlehem in Judah, whose name was Jesse, and he had eight sons. And Jesse [fn] was old in the days of Saul, advanced in years among men.\n 1Sa 17:13 The three older sons of Jesse had gone [fn] after Saul to the battle. And the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and the second to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.\n 1Sa 17:14 David was the youngest. Now the three oldest followed Saul,\n 1Sa 17:15 but David went back and forth from Saul to tend his father's flock at Bethlehem.\n 1Sa 17:16 The Philistine came forward [fn] morning and evening for forty days and took his stand.\n 1Sa 17:17 Then Jesse said to David his son, \"Take now for your brothers an ephah of this roasted grain and these ten loaves and run to the camp to your brothers.\n 1Sa 17:18 \"Bring also these ten cuts of cheese to the commander of their thousand, and look into the welfare of your brothers, and bring back news [fn] of them.\n 1Sa 17:19 \"For Saul and they and all the men of Israel are in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.\"\n 1Sa 17:20 So David arose early in the morning and left the flock with a keeper and took the supplies and went as Jesse had commanded him. And he came to the circle of the camp while the army was going out in battle array shouting the war cry.\n 1Sa 17:21 Israel and the Philistines drew up in battle array, army against army.\n 1Sa 17:22 Then David left his baggage in the care [fn] of the baggage keeper, and ran to the battle line and entered in order to greet his brothers.\n 1Sa 17:23 As he was talking with them, behold, the champion, the Philistine from Gath named Goliath, was coming up from the army of the Philistines, and he spoke these same words; and David heard them.\n 1Sa 17:24 When all the men of Israel saw the man, they fled from him and were greatly afraid.\n 1Sa 17:25 The men of Israel said, \"Have you seen this man who is coming up? Surely he is coming up to defy Israel. And it will be that the king will enrich the man who kills him with great riches and will give him his daughter and make his father's house free [fn] in Israel.\"\n 1Sa 17:26 Then David spoke to the men who were standing by him, saying, \"What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should taunt the armies of the living God?\"\n 1Sa 17:27 The people answered [fn] him in accord with this word, saying, \"Thus it will be done for the man who kills him.\"\n 1Sa 17:28 Now Eliab his oldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab's anger burned against David and he said, \"Why have you come down? And with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your insolence and the wickedness of your heart; for you have come down in order to see the battle.\"\n 1Sa 17:29 But David said, \"What have I done now? Was it not just a question?\" [fn]\n 1Sa 17:30 Then he turned away [fn] from him to another and said the same thing; and the people answered the same thing as before. [fn]\n 1Sa 17:31 When the words which David spoke were heard, they told them to [fn] Saul, and he sent for him.\n 1Sa 17:32 David said to Saul, \"Let no man's heart fail on account of him; your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.\"\n 1Sa 17:33 Then Saul said to David, \"You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for you are but a youth while he has been a warrior from his youth.\"\n 1Sa 17:34 But David said to Saul, \"Your servant was tending his father's sheep. When a lion or a bear came and took a lamb from the flock,\n 1Sa 17:35 I went out after him and attacked [fn] him, and rescued it from his mouth; and when he rose up against me, I seized him by his beard and struck [fn] him and killed him.\n 1Sa 17:36 \"Your servant has killed [fn] both the lion and the bear; and this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, since he has taunted the armies of the living God.\"\n 1Sa 17:37 And David said, \"The LORD who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, He will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.\" And Saul said to David, \"Go, and may the LORD be with you.\"\n 1Sa 17:38 Then Saul clothed David with his garments and put a bronze helmet on his head, and he clothed him with armor.\n 1Sa 17:39 David girded his sword over his armor and tried to walk, for he had not tested them. So David said to Saul, \"I cannot go with these, for I have not tested them.\" And David took them off. [fn]\n 1Sa 17:40 He took his stick in his hand and chose for himself five smooth stones from the brook, and put them in the shepherd's bag which he had, even in his pouch, and his sling was in his hand; and he approached the Philistine.\n 1Sa 17:41 Then the Philistine came on and approached David, with the shield-bearer in front of him.\n 1Sa 17:42 When the Philistine looked and saw David, he disdained him; for he was but a youth, and ruddy, with a handsome appearance.\n 1Sa 17:43 The Philistine said to David, \"Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?\" And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.\n 1Sa 17:44 The Philistine also said to David, \"Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the sky and the beasts of the field.\"\n 1Sa 17:45 Then David said to the Philistine, \"You come to me with a sword, a spear, and a javelin, but I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have taunted.\n 1Sa 17:46 \"This day the LORD will deliver you up into my hands, and I will strike you down and remove your head from you. And I will give the dead bodies of the army of the Philistines this day to the birds of the sky and the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,\n 1Sa 17:47 and that all this assembly may know that the LORD does not deliver by sword or by spear; for the battle is the LORD'S and He will give you into our hands.\"\n 1Sa 17:48 Then it happened when the Philistine rose and came and drew near to meet David, that David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine.\n 1Sa 17:49 And David put his hand into his bag and took from it a stone and slung it, and struck the Philistine on his forehead. And the stone sank into his forehead, so that he fell on his face to the ground.\n 1Sa 17:50 Thus David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone, and he struck the Philistine and killed him; but there was no sword in David's hand.\n 1Sa 17:51 Then David ran and stood over the Philistine and took his sword and drew it out of its sheath and killed him, and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.\n 1Sa 17:52 The men of Israel and Judah arose and shouted and pursued the Philistines as [fn] far as the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the slain Philistines lay [fn] along the way to Shaaraim, even to Gath and Ekron.\n 1Sa 17:53 The sons of Israel returned from chasing the Philistines and plundered their camps.\n 1Sa 17:54 Then David took the Philistine's head and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put his weapons in his tent.\n 1Sa 17:55 Now when Saul saw David going out against the Philistine, he said to Abner the commander of the army, \"Abner, whose son is this young man?\" And Abner said, \"By your life, O king, I do not know.\"\n 1Sa 17:56 The king said, \"You inquire whose son the youth is.\"\n 1Sa 17:57 So when David returned from killing the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul with the Philistine's head in his hand.\n 1Sa 17:58 Saul said to him, \"Whose son are you, young man?\" And David answered, \"I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.\n \n 1Sa 18:1 Now it came about when he had finished speaking to Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as himself.\n 1Sa 18:2 Saul took him that day and did not let him return to his father's house.\n 1Sa 18:3 Then Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself.\n 1Sa 18:4 Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him and gave it to David, with his armor, including his sword and his bow and his belt.\n 1Sa 18:5 So David went out wherever Saul sent him, and prospered; [fn] and Saul set him over the men of war. And it was pleasing in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of Saul's servants.\n 1Sa 18:6 It happened as they were coming, when David returned from killing the Philistine, that the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul, with tambourines, with joy and with musical [fn] instruments.\n 1Sa 18:7 The women sang as they played, [fn] and said, \"Saul has slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands.\"\n 1Sa 18:8 Then Saul became very angry, for this saying displeased [fn] him; and he said, \"They have ascribed to David ten thousands, but to me they have ascribed thousands. Now what more can he have but the kingdom?\"\n 1Sa 18:9 Saul looked at David with suspicion from that day on.\n 1Sa 18:10 Now it came about on the next day that an evil spirit from God came mightily upon Saul, and he raved in the midst of the house, while David was playing the harp with his hand, as [fn] usual; and a [fn] spear was in Saul's hand.\n 1Sa 18:11 Saul hurled the spear for he thought, \"I will pin [fn] David to the wall.\" But David escaped [fn] from his presence twice.\n 1Sa 18:12 Now Saul was afraid of David, for the LORD was with him but had departed from Saul.\n 1Sa 18:13 Therefore Saul removed him from his [fn] presence and appointed him as his commander of a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.\n 1Sa 18:14 David was prospering [fn] in all his ways for the LORD was with him.\n 1Sa 18:15 When Saul saw that he was prospering [fn] greatly, he dreaded him.\n 1Sa 18:16 But all Israel and Judah loved David, and he went out and came in before them.\n 1Sa 18:17 Then Saul said to David, \"Here is my older daughter Merab; I will give her to you as a wife, only be a valiant man for me and fight the LORD'S battles.\" For Saul thought, \"My hand shall not be against him, but let the hand of the Philistines be against him.\"\n 1Sa 18:18 But David said to Saul, \"Who am I, and what is my life or my father's family in Israel, that I should be the king's son-in-law?\"\n 1Sa 18:19 So it came about at the time when Merab, Saul's daughter, should have been given to David, that she was given to Adriel the Meholathite for a wife.\n 1Sa 18:20 Now Michal, Saul's daughter, loved David. When they told Saul, the thing was agreeable to [fn] him.\n 1Sa 18:21 Saul thought, \"I will give her to him that she may become a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.\" Therefore Saul said to David, \"For a second time you may be my son-in-law today.\"\n 1Sa 18:22 Then Saul commanded his servants, \"Speak to David secretly, saying, 'Behold, the king delights in you, and all his servants love you; now therefore, become the king's son-in-law.' \"\n 1Sa 18:23 So Saul's servants spoke these words to [fn] David. But David said, \"Is it trivial in your sight to become the king's son-in-law, since I am a poor man and lightly esteemed?\"\n 1Sa 18:24 The servants of Saul reported to him according [fn] to these words which David spoke.\n 1Sa 18:25 Saul then said, \"Thus you shall say to David, 'The king does not desire any dowry except a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to take vengeance on the king's enemies.' \" Now Saul planned to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.\n 1Sa 18:26 When his servants told David these words, it [fn] pleased David to become the king's son-in-law. Before [fn] the days had expired\n 1Sa 18:27 David rose up and went, he and his men, and struck down two hundred men among the Philistines. Then David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king, that he might become the king's son-in-law. So Saul gave him Michal his daughter for a wife.\n 1Sa 18:28 When Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal, Saul's daughter, loved him,\n 1Sa 18:29 then Saul was even more afraid of David. Thus Saul was David's enemy continually.\n 1Sa 18:30 Then the commanders of the Philistines went out to battle, and it happened as often as they went out, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul. So his name was highly esteemed.\n \n 1Sa 19:1 Now Saul told Jonathan his son and all his servants to put David to death. But Jonathan, Saul's son, greatly delighted in David.\n 1Sa 19:2 So Jonathan told David saying, \"Saul my father is seeking to put you to death. Now therefore, please be on guard in the morning, and stay in a secret place and hide yourself.\n 1Sa 19:3 \"I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will speak with my father about you; if I find [fn] out anything, then I will tell you.\"\n 1Sa 19:4 Then Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father and said to him, \"Do not let the king sin against his servant David, since he has not sinned against you, and since his deeds have been very beneficial [fn] to you.\n 1Sa 19:5 \"For he took his life in his hand and struck the Philistine, and the LORD brought about a great deliverance for all Israel; you saw it and rejoiced. Why then will you sin against innocent blood by putting David to death without a cause?\"\n 1Sa 19:6 Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan, and Saul vowed, \"As the LORD lives, he shall not be put to death.\"\n 1Sa 19:7 Then Jonathan called David, and Jonathan told him all these words. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence as formerly.\n 1Sa 19:8 When there was war again, David went out and fought with the Philistines and defeated [fn] them with great slaughter, so that they fled before him.\n 1Sa 19:9 Now there was an evil spirit from the LORD on Saul as he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand, and David was playing the harp with his hand.\n 1Sa 19:10 Saul tried to pin [fn] David to the wall with the spear, but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, so that he stuck [fn] the spear into the wall. And David fled and escaped that night.\n 1Sa 19:11 Then Saul sent messengers to David's house to watch him, in order to put him to death in the morning. But Michal, David's wife, told him, saying, \"If you do not save your life tonight, tomorrow you will be put to death.\"\n 1Sa 19:12 So Michal let David down through a window, and he went out and fled and escaped.\n 1Sa 19:13 Michal took the household [fn] idol and laid it on the bed, and put a quilt of goats' hair at its head, and covered it with clothes.\n 1Sa 19:14 When Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, \"He is sick.\"\n 1Sa 19:15 Then Saul sent messengers to see David, saying, \"Bring him up to me on his [fn] bed, that I may put him to death.\"\n 1Sa 19:16 When the messengers entered, behold, the household [fn] idol was on the bed with the quilt of goats' hair at its head.\n 1Sa 19:17 So Saul said to Michal, \"Why have you deceived me like this and let my enemy go, so that he has escaped?\" And Michal said to Saul, \"He said to me, 'Let me go! Why should I put you to death?' \"\n 1Sa 19:18 Now David fled and escaped and came to Samuel at Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and stayed in Naioth.\n 1Sa 19:19 It was told Saul, saying, \"Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.\"\n 1Sa 19:20 Then Saul sent messengers to take David, but when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, with Samuel standing and presiding over them, the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul; and they also prophesied.\n 1Sa 19:21 When it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. So Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied.\n 1Sa 19:22 Then he himself went to Ramah and came as far as the large well that is in Secu; and he asked and said, \"Where are Samuel and David?\" And someone said, \"Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah.\"\n 1Sa 19:23 He proceeded [fn] there to Naioth in Ramah; and the Spirit of God came upon him also, so that he went along prophesying continually until he came to Naioth in Ramah.\n 1Sa 19:24 He also stripped off his clothes, and he too prophesied before Samuel and lay [fn] down naked [fn] all that day and all that night. Therefore they say, \"Is Saul also among the prophets?\"\n \n 1Sa 20:1 Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said to [fn] Jonathan, \"What have I done? What is my iniquity? And what is my sin before your father, that he is seeking my life?\"\n 1Sa 20:2 He said to him, \"Far from it, you shall not die. Behold, my father does nothing either great or small without [fn] disclosing it to me. So why should my father hide this thing from me? It is not so!\"\n 1Sa 20:3 Yet David vowed again, saying, [fn] \"Your father knows well that I have found favor in your sight, and he has said, 'Do not let Jonathan know this, or he will be grieved.' But truly as the LORD lives and as your soul lives, there is hardly [fn] a step between me and death.\"\n 1Sa 20:4 Then Jonathan said to David, \"Whatever you [fn] say, I will do for you.\"\n 1Sa 20:5 So David said to Jonathan, \"Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and I ought to sit down to eat with the king. But let me go, that I may hide myself in the field until the third evening.\n 1Sa 20:6 \"If your father misses me at all, then say, 'David earnestly asked leave of me to run to Bethlehem his city, because it is the yearly sacrifice there for the whole family.'\n 1Sa 20:7 \"If he says, [fn] 'It is good,' your servant will be safe; but if he is very angry, know that he has decided on evil.\n 1Sa 20:8 \"Therefore deal kindly with your servant, for you have brought your servant into a covenant of the LORD with you. But if there is iniquity in me, put me to death yourself; for why then should you bring me to your father?\"\n 1Sa 20:9 Jonathan said, \"Far be it from you! For if I should indeed learn that evil has been decided by my father to come upon you, then would I not tell you about it?\"\n 1Sa 20:10 Then David said to Jonathan, \"Who will tell me if [fn] your father answers you harshly?\"\n 1Sa 20:11 Jonathan said to David, \"Come, and let us go out into the field.\" So both of them went out to the field.\n 1Sa 20:12 Then Jonathan said to David, \"The LORD, the God of Israel, be witness! When I have sounded out my father about this time tomorrow, or the third day, behold, if there is good feeling toward David, shall I not then send to you and make [fn] it known to you?\n 1Sa 20:13 \"If it please my father to do you harm, may the LORD do so to Jonathan and more also, if I do not make [fn] it known to you and send you away, that you may go in safety. And may the LORD be with you as He has been with my father.\n 1Sa 20:14 \"If I am still alive, will you not show me the lovingkindness of the LORD, that I may not die?\n 1Sa 20:15 \"You shall not cut off your lovingkindness from my house forever, not even when the LORD cuts off every one of the enemies of David from the face of the earth.\"\n 1Sa 20:16 So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, \"May the LORD require it at the hands of David's enemies.\"\n 1Sa 20:17 Jonathan made David vow again because of his love for him, because he loved him as he loved his own life.\n 1Sa 20:18 Then Jonathan said to him, \"Tomorrow is the new moon, and you will be missed because your seat will be empty.\n 1Sa 20:19 \"When you have stayed for three days, you shall go down quickly and come to the place where you hid yourself on that eventful day, and you shall remain by the stone Ezel.\n 1Sa 20:20 \"I will shoot three arrows to the side, as though I shot at a target.\n 1Sa 20:21 \"And behold, I will send the lad, saying, 'Go, find the arrows.' If I specifically say to the lad, 'Behold, the arrows are on this side of you, get them,' then come; for there is safety for you and no [fn] harm, as the LORD lives.\n 1Sa 20:22 \"But if I say [fn] to the youth, 'Behold, the arrows are beyond you,' go, for the LORD has sent you away.\n 1Sa 20:23 \"As for the agreement [fn] of which you and I have spoken, behold, the LORD is between you and me forever.\"\n 1Sa 20:24 So David hid in the field; and when the new moon came, the king sat down to eat food.\n 1Sa 20:25 The king sat on his seat as usual, the seat by the wall; then Jonathan rose up and Abner sat down by Saul's side, but David's place was empty.\n 1Sa 20:26 Nevertheless Saul did not speak anything that day, for he thought, \"It is an accident, he is not clean, surely he is not clean.\"\n 1Sa 20:27 It came about the next day, the second day of the new moon, that David's place was empty; so Saul said to Jonathan his son, \"Why has the son of Jesse not come to the meal, either yesterday or today?\"\n 1Sa 20:28 Jonathan then answered Saul, \"David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem,\n 1Sa 20:29 for he said, 'Please let [fn] me go, since our family has a sacrifice in the city, and my brother has commanded me to attend. And now, if I have found favor in your sight, please let me get away that I may see my brothers.' For this reason he has not come to the king's table.\"\n 1Sa 20:30 Then Saul's anger burned against Jonathan and he said to him, \"You son of a perverse, rebellious woman! Do I not know that you are choosing the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of your mother's nakedness?\n 1Sa 20:31 \"For as [fn] long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, neither you nor your kingdom will be established. Therefore now, send and bring him to me, for he must [fn] surely die.\"\n 1Sa 20:32 But Jonathan answered Saul his father and said to him, \"Why should he be put to death? What has he done?\"\n 1Sa 20:33 Then Saul hurled his spear at him to strike him down; so Jonathan knew that his father had decided to put David to death.\n 1Sa 20:34 Then Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did not eat food on the second day of the new moon, for he was grieved over David because his father had dishonored him.\n 1Sa 20:35 Now it came about in the morning that Jonathan went out into the field for the appointment with David, and a little lad was with him.\n 1Sa 20:36 He said to his lad, \"Run, find now the arrows which I am about to shoot.\" As the lad was running, he shot an [fn] arrow past him.\n 1Sa 20:37 When the lad reached the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan called after the lad and said, \"Is not the arrow beyond you?\"\n 1Sa 20:38 And Jonathan called after the lad, \"Hurry, be quick, do not stay!\" And Jonathan's lad picked up the arrow and came to his master.\n 1Sa 20:39 But the lad was not aware of anything; only Jonathan and David knew about the matter.\n 1Sa 20:40 Then Jonathan gave his weapons to his lad and said to him, \"Go, bring them to the city.\"\n 1Sa 20:41 When the lad was gone, David rose from the south side and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed three times. And they kissed each other and wept together, but David wept the more.\n 1Sa 20:42 Jonathan said to David, \"Go in safety, inasmuch as we have sworn to each other in the name of the LORD, saying, 'The LORD will be between me and you, and between my descendants [fn] and your descendants [fn] forever.' \" Then [fn] he rose and departed, while Jonathan went into the city.\n Notice that the full content of the relationship between Jonathan, David and Saul which spanned 4 chapters rather than a few choice verses was about political power and war, but had nothing at all to do with homosexuality or a sexual relationship between David and Jonathan.",

Am I not the Philistine and you servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves and let him come down to me.\n 1Sa 17:9 \"If he is able to fight with me and kill [fn] me, then we will become your servants; but if I prevail against him and kill [fn] him, then you shall become our servants and serve us.\"\n 1Sa 17:10 Again the Philistine said, \"I defy the ranks of Israel this day; give me a man that we may fight together.\"\n 1Sa 17:11 When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid.\n 1Sa 17:12 Now David was the son of the [fn] Ephrathite of Bethlehem in Judah, whose name was Jesse, and he had eight sons. And Jesse [fn] was old in the days of Saul, advanced in years among men.\n 1Sa 17:13 The three older sons of Jesse had gone [fn] after Saul to the battle. And the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and the second to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.\n 1Sa 17:14 David was the youngest. Now the three oldest followed Saul,\n 1Sa 17:15 but David went back and forth from Saul to tend his father's flock at Bethlehem.\n 1Sa 17:16 The Philistine came forward [fn] morning and evening for forty days and took his stand.\n 1Sa 17:17 Then Jesse said to David his son, \"Take now for your brothers an ephah of this roasted grain and these ten loaves and run to the camp to your brothers.\n 1Sa 17:18 \"Bring also these ten cuts of cheese to the commander of their thousand, and look into the welfare of your brothers, and bring back news [fn] of them.\n 1Sa 17:19 \"For Saul and they and all the men of Israel are in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.\"\n 1Sa 17:20 So David arose early in the morning and left the flock with a keeper and took the supplies and went as Jesse had commanded him. And he came to the circle of the camp while the army was going out in battle array shouting the war cry.\n 1Sa 17:21 Israel and the Philistines drew up in battle array, army against army.\n 1Sa 17:22 Then David left his baggage in the care [fn] of the baggage keeper, and ran to the battle line and entered in order to greet his brothers.\n 1Sa 17:23 As he was talking with them, behold, the champion, the Philistine from Gath named Goliath, was coming up from the army of the Philistines, and he spoke these same words; and David heard them.\n 1Sa 17:24 When all the men of Israel saw the man, they fled from him and were greatly afraid.\n 1Sa 17:25 The men of Israel said, \"Have you seen this man who is coming up? Surely he is coming up to defy Israel. And it will be that the king will enrich the man who kills him with great riches and will give him his daughter and make his father's house free [fn] in Israel.\"\n 1Sa 17:26 Then David spoke to the men who were standing by him, saying, \"What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should taunt the armies of the living God?\"\n 1Sa 17:27 The people answered [fn] him in accord with this word, saying, \"Thus it will be done for the man who kills him.\"\n 1Sa 17:28 Now Eliab his oldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab's anger burned against David and he said, \"Why have you come down? And with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your insolence and the wickedness of your heart; for you have come down in order to see the battle.\"\n 1Sa 17:29 But David said, \"What have I done now? Was it not just a question?\" [fn]\n 1Sa 17:30 Then he turned away [fn] from him to another and said the same thing; and the people answered the same thing as before. [fn]\n 1Sa 17:31 When the words which David spoke were heard, they told them to [fn] Saul, and he sent for him.\n 1Sa 17:32 David said to Saul, \"Let no man's heart fail on account of him; your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.\"\n 1Sa 17:33 Then Saul said to David, \"You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for you are but a youth while he has been a warrior from his youth.\"\n 1Sa 17:34 But David said to Saul, \"Your servant was tending his father's sheep. When a lion or a bear came and took a lamb from the flock,\n 1Sa 17:35 I went out after him and attacked [fn] him, and rescued it from his mouth; and when he rose up against me, I seized him by his beard and struck [fn] him and killed him.\n 1Sa 17:36 \"Your servant has killed [fn] both the lion and the bear; and this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, since he has taunted the armies of the living God.\"\n 1Sa 17:37 And David said, \"The LORD who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, He will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.\" And Saul said to David, \"Go, and may the LORD be with you.\"\n 1Sa 17:38 Then Saul clothed David with his garments and put a bronze helmet on his head, and he clothed him with armor.\n 1Sa 17:39 David girded his sword over his armor and tried to walk, for he had not tested them. So David said to Saul, \"I cannot go with these, for I have not tested them.\" And David took them off. [fn]\n 1Sa 17:40 He took his stick in his hand and chose for himself five smooth stones from the brook, and put them in the shepherd's bag which he had, even in his pouch, and his sling was in his hand; and he approached the Philistine.\n 1Sa 17:41 Then the Philistine came on and approached David, with the shield-bearer in front of him.\n 1Sa 17:42 When the Philistine looked and saw David, he disdained him; for he was but a youth, and ruddy, with a handsome appearance.\n 1Sa 17:43 The Philistine said to David, \"Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?\" And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.\n 1Sa 17:44 The Philistine also said to David, \"Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the sky and the beasts of the field.\"\n 1Sa 17:45 Then David said to the Philistine, \"You come to me with a sword, a spear, and a javelin, but I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have taunted.\n 1Sa 17:46 \"This day the LORD will deliver you up into my hands, and I will strike you down and remove your head from you. And I will give the dead bodies of the army of the Philistines this day to the birds of the sky and the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,\n 1Sa 17:47 and that all this assembly may know that the LORD does not deliver by sword or by spear; for the battle is the LORD'S and He will give you into our hands.\"\n 1Sa 17:48 Then it happened when the Philistine rose and came and drew near to meet David, that David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine.\n 1Sa 17:49 And David put his hand into his bag and took from it a stone and slung it, and struck the Philistine on his forehead. And the stone sank into his forehead, so that he fell on his face to the ground.\n 1Sa 17:50 Thus David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone, and he struck the Philistine and killed him; but there was no sword in David's hand.\n 1Sa 17:51 Then David ran and stood over the Philistine and took his sword and drew it out of its sheath and killed him, and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.\n 1Sa 17:52 The men of Israel and Judah arose and shouted and pursued the Philistines as [fn] far as the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the slain Philistines lay [fn] along the way to Shaaraim, even to Gath and Ekron.\n 1Sa 17:53 The sons of Israel returned from chasing the Philistines and plundered their camps.\n 1Sa 17:54 Then David took the Philistine's head and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put his weapons in his tent.\n 1Sa 17:55 Now when Saul saw David going out against the Philistine, he said to Abner the commander of the army, \"Abner, whose son is this young man?\" And Abner said, \"By your life, O king, I do not know.\"\n 1Sa 17:56 The king said, \"You inquire whose son the youth is.\"\n 1Sa 17:57 So when David returned from killing the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul with the Philistine's head in his hand.\n 1Sa 17:58 Saul said to him, \"Whose son are you, young man?\" And David answered, \"I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.\n \n 1Sa 18:1 Now it came about when he had finished speaking to Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as himself.\n 1Sa 18:2 Saul took him that day and did not let him return to his father's house.\n 1Sa 18:3 Then Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself.\n 1Sa 18:4 Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him and gave it to David, with his armor, including his sword and his bow and his belt.\n 1Sa 18:5 So David went out wherever Saul sent him, and prospered; [fn] and Saul set him over the men of war. And it was pleasing in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of Saul's servants.\n 1Sa 18:6 It happened as they were coming, when David returned from killing the Philistine, that the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul, with tambourines, with joy and with musical [fn] instruments.\n 1Sa 18:7 The women sang as they played, [fn] and said, \"Saul has slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands.\"\n 1Sa 18:8 Then Saul became very angry, for this saying displeased [fn] him; and he said, \"They have ascribed to David ten thousands, but to me they have ascribed thousands. Now what more can he have but the kingdom?\"\n 1Sa 18:9 Saul looked at David with suspicion from that day on.\n 1Sa 18:10 Now it came about on the next day that an evil spirit from God came mightily upon Saul, and he raved in the midst of the house, while David was playing the harp with his hand, as [fn] usual; and a [fn] spear was in Saul's hand.\n 1Sa 18:11 Saul hurled the spear for he thought, \"I will pin [fn] David to the wall.\" But David escaped [fn] from his presence twice.\n 1Sa 18:12 Now Saul was afraid of David, for the LORD was with him but had departed from Saul.\n 1Sa 18:13 Therefore Saul removed him from his [fn] presence and appointed him as his commander of a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.\n 1Sa 18:14 David was prospering [fn] in all his ways for the LORD was with him.\n 1Sa 18:15 When Saul saw that he was prospering [fn] greatly, he dreaded him.\n 1Sa 18:16 But all Israel and Judah loved David, and he went out and came in before them.\n 1Sa 18:17 Then Saul said to David, \"Here is my older daughter Merab; I will give her to you as a wife, only be a valiant man for me and fight the LORD'S battles.\" For Saul thought, \"My hand shall not be against him, but let the hand of the Philistines be against him.\"\n 1Sa 18:18 But David said to Saul, \"Who am I, and what is my life or my father's family in Israel, that I should be the king's son-in-law?\"\n 1Sa 18:19 So it came about at the time when Merab, Saul's daughter, should have been given to David, that she was given to Adriel the Meholathite for a wife.\n 1Sa 18:20 Now Michal, Saul's daughter, loved David. When they told Saul, the thing was agreeable to [fn] him.\n 1Sa 18:21 Saul thought, \"I will give her to him that she may become a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.\" Therefore Saul said to David, \"For a second time you may be my son-in-law today.\"\n 1Sa 18:22 Then Saul commanded his servants, \"Speak to David secretly, saying, 'Behold, the king delights in you, and all his servants love you; now therefore, become the king's son-in-law.' \"\n 1Sa 18:23 So Saul's servants spoke these words to [fn] David. But David said, \"Is it trivial in your sight to become the king's son-in-law, since I am a poor man and lightly esteemed?\"\n 1Sa 18:24 The servants of Saul reported to him according [fn] to these words which David spoke.\n 1Sa 18:25 Saul then said, \"Thus you shall say to David, 'The king does not desire any dowry except a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to take vengeance on the king's enemies.' \" Now Saul planned to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.\n 1Sa 18:26 When his servants told David these words, it [fn] pleased David to become the king's son-in-law. Before [fn] the days had expired\n 1Sa 18:27 David rose up and went, he and his men, and struck down two hundred men among the Philistines. Then David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king, that he might become the king's son-in-law. So Saul gave him Michal his daughter for a wife.\n 1Sa 18:28 When Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal, Saul's daughter, loved him,\n 1Sa 18:29 then Saul was even more afraid of David. Thus Saul was David's enemy continually.\n 1Sa 18:30 Then the commanders of the Philistines went out to battle, and it happened as often as they went out, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul. So his name was highly esteemed.\n \n 1Sa 19:1 Now Saul told Jonathan his son and all his servants to put David to death. But Jonathan, Saul's son, greatly delighted in David.\n 1Sa 19:2 So Jonathan told David saying, \"Saul my father is seeking to put you to death. Now therefore, please be on guard in the morning, and stay in a secret place and hide yourself.\n 1Sa 19:3 \"I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will speak with my father about you; if I find [fn] out anything, then I will tell you.\"\n 1Sa 19:4 Then Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father and said to him, \"Do not let the king sin against his servant David, since he has not sinned against you, and since his deeds have been very beneficial [fn] to you.\n 1Sa 19:5 \"For he took his life in his hand and struck the Philistine, and the LORD brought about a great deliverance for all Israel; you saw it and rejoiced. Why then will you sin against innocent blood by putting David to death without a cause?\"\n 1Sa 19:6 Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan, and Saul vowed, \"As the LORD lives, he shall not be put to death.\"\n 1Sa 19:7 Then Jonathan called David, and Jonathan told him all these words. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence as formerly.\n 1Sa 19:8 When there was war again, David went out and fought with the Philistines and defeated [fn] them with great slaughter, so that they fled before him.\n 1Sa 19:9 Now there was an evil spirit from the LORD on Saul as he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand, and David was playing the harp with his hand.\n 1Sa 19:10 Saul tried to pin [fn] David to the wall with the spear, but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, so that he stuck [fn] the spear into the wall. And David fled and escaped that night.\n 1Sa 19:11 Then Saul sent messengers to David's house to watch him, in order to put him to death in the morning. But Michal, David's wife, told him, saying, \"If you do not save your life tonight, tomorrow you will be put to death.\"\n 1Sa 19:12 So Michal let David down through a window, and he went out and fled and escaped.\n 1Sa 19:13 Michal took the household [fn] idol and laid it on the bed, and put a quilt of goats' hair at its head, and covered it with clothes.\n 1Sa 19:14 When Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, \"He is sick.\"\n 1Sa 19:15 Then Saul sent messengers to see David, saying, \"Bring him up to me on his [fn] bed, that I may put him to death.\"\n 1Sa 19:16 When the messengers entered, behold, the household [fn] idol was on the bed with the quilt of goats' hair at its head.\n 1Sa 19:17 So Saul said to Michal, \"Why have you deceived me like this and let my enemy go, so that he has escaped?\" And Michal said to Saul, \"He said to me, 'Let me go! Why should I put you to death?' \"\n 1Sa 19:18 Now David fled and escaped and came to Samuel at Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and stayed in Naioth.\n 1Sa 19:19 It was told Saul, saying, \"Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.\"\n 1Sa 19:20 Then Saul sent messengers to take David, but when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, with Samuel standing and presiding over them, the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul; and they also prophesied.\n 1Sa 19:21 When it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. So Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied.\n 1Sa 19:22 Then he himself went to Ramah and came as far as the large well that is in Secu; and he asked and said, \"Where are Samuel and David?\" And someone said, \"Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah.\"\n 1Sa 19:23 He proceeded [fn] there to Naioth in Ramah; and the Spirit of God came upon him also, so that he went along prophesying continually until he came to Naioth in Ramah.\n 1Sa 19:24 He also stripped off his clothes, and he too prophesied before Samuel and lay [fn] down naked [fn] all that day and all that night. Therefore they say, \"Is Saul also among the prophets?\"\n \n 1Sa 20:1 Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said to [fn] Jonathan, \"What have I done? What is my iniquity? And what is my sin before your father, that he is seeking my life?\"\n 1Sa 20:2 He said to him, \"Far from it, you shall not die. Behold, my father does nothing either great or small without [fn] disclosing it to me. So why should my father hide this thing from me? It is not so!\"\n 1Sa 20:3 Yet David vowed again, saying, [fn] \"Your father knows well that I have found favor in your sight, and he has said, 'Do not let Jonathan know this, or he will be grieved.' But truly as the LORD lives and as your soul lives, there is hardly [fn] a step between me and death.\"\n 1Sa 20:4 Then Jonathan said to David, \"Whatever you [fn] say, I will do for you.\"\n 1Sa 20:5 So David said to Jonathan, \"Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and I ought to sit down to eat with the king. But let me go, that I may hide myself in the field until the third evening.\n 1Sa 20:6 \"If your father misses me at all, then say, 'David earnestly asked leave of me to run to Bethlehem his city, because it is the yearly sacrifice there for the whole family.'\n 1Sa 20:7 \"If he says, [fn] 'It is good,' your servant will be safe; but if he is very angry, know that he has decided on evil.\n 1Sa 20:8 \"Therefore deal kindly with your servant, for you have brought your servant into a covenant of the LORD with you. But if there is iniquity in me, put me to death yourself; for why then should you bring me to your father?\"\n 1Sa 20:9 Jonathan said, \"Far be it from you! For if I should indeed learn that evil has been decided by my father to come upon you, then would I not tell you about it?\"\n 1Sa 20:10 Then David said to Jonathan, \"Who will tell me if [fn] your father answers you harshly?\"\n 1Sa 20:11 Jonathan said to David, \"Come, and let us go out into the field.\" So both of them went out to the field.\n 1Sa 20:12 Then Jonathan said to David, \"The LORD, the God of Israel, be witness! When I have sounded out my father about this time tomorrow, or the third day, behold, if there is good feeling toward David, shall I not then send to you and make [fn] it known to you?\n 1Sa 20:13 \"If it please my father to do you harm, may the LORD do so to Jonathan and more also, if I do not make [fn] it known to you and send you away, that you may go in safety. And may the LORD be with you as He has been with my father.\n 1Sa 20:14 \"If I am still alive, will you not show me the lovingkindness of the LORD, that I may not die?\n 1Sa 20:15 \"You shall not cut off your lovingkindness from my house forever, not even when the LORD cuts off every one of the enemies of David from the face of the earth.\"\n 1Sa 20:16 So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, \"May the LORD require it at the hands of David's enemies.\"\n 1Sa 20:17 Jonathan made David vow again because of his love for him, because he loved him as he loved his own life.\n 1Sa 20:18 Then Jonathan said to him, \"Tomorrow is the new moon, and you will be missed because your seat will be empty.\n 1Sa 20:19 \"When you have stayed for three days, you shall go down quickly and come to the place where you hid yourself on that eventful day, and you shall remain by the stone Ezel.\n 1Sa 20:20 \"I will shoot three arrows to the side, as though I shot at a target.\n 1Sa 20:21 \"And behold, I will send the lad, saying, 'Go, find the arrows.' If I specifically say to the lad, 'Behold, the arrows are on this side of you, get them,' then come; for there is safety for you and no [fn] harm, as the LORD lives.\n 1Sa 20:22 \"But if I say [fn] to the youth, 'Behold, the arrows are beyond you,' go, for the LORD has sent you away.\n 1Sa 20:23 \"As for the agreement [fn] of which you and I have spoken, behold, the LORD is between you and me forever.\"\n 1Sa 20:24 So David hid in the field; and when the new moon came, the king sat down to eat food.\n 1Sa 20:25 The king sat on his seat as usual, the seat by the wall; then Jonathan rose up and Abner sat down by Saul's side, but David's place was empty.\n 1Sa 20:26 Nevertheless Saul did not speak anything that day, for he thought, \"It is an accident, he is not clean, surely he is not clean.\"\n 1Sa 20:27 It came about the next day, the second day of the new moon, that David's place was empty; so Saul said to Jonathan his son, \"Why has the son of Jesse not come to the meal, either yesterday or today?\"\n 1Sa 20:28 Jonathan then answered Saul, \"David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem,\n 1Sa 20:29 for he said, 'Please let [fn] me go, since our family has a sacrifice in the city, and my brother has commanded me to attend. And now, if I have found favor in your sight, please let me get away that I may see my brothers.' For this reason he has not come to the king's table.\"\n 1Sa 20:30 Then Saul's anger burned against Jonathan and he said to him, \"You son of a perverse, rebellious woman! Do I not know that you are choosing the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of your mother's nakedness?\n 1Sa 20:31 \"For as [fn] long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, neither you nor your kingdom will be established. Therefore now, send and bring him to me, for he must [fn] surely die.\"\n 1Sa 20:32 But Jonathan answered Saul his father and said to him, \"Why should he be put to death? What has he done?\"\n 1Sa 20:33 Then Saul hurled his spear at him to strike him down; so Jonathan knew that his father had decided to put David to death.\n 1Sa 20:34 Then Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did not eat food on the second day of the new moon, for he was grieved over David because his father had dishonored him.\n 1Sa 20:35 Now it came about in the morning that Jonathan went out into the field for the appointment with David, and a little lad was with him.\n 1Sa 20:36 He said to his lad, \"Run, find now the arrows which I am about to shoot.\" As the lad was running, he shot an [fn] arrow past him.\n 1Sa 20:37 When the lad reached the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan called after the lad and said, \"Is not the arrow beyond you?\"\n 1Sa 20:38 And Jonathan called after the lad, \"Hurry, be quick, do not stay!\" And Jonathan's lad picked up the arrow and came to his master.\n 1Sa 20:39 But the lad was not aware of anything; only Jonathan and David knew about the matter.\n 1Sa 20:40 Then Jonathan gave his weapons to his lad and said to him, \"Go, bring them to the city.\"\n 1Sa 20:41 When the lad was gone, David rose from the south side and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed three times. And they kissed each other and wept together, but David wept the more.\n 1Sa 20:42 Jonathan said to David, \"Go in safety, inasmuch as we have sworn to each other in the name of the LORD, saying, 'The LORD will be between me and you, and between my descendants [fn] and your descendants [fn] forever.' \" Then [fn] he rose and departed, while Jonathan went into the city.\n Notice that the full content of the relationship between Jonathan, David and Saul which spanned 4 chapters rather than a few choice verses was about political power and war, but had nothing at all to do with homosexuality or a sexual relationship between David and Jonathan.\n\n \n \nThe binding of souls is the important thing. When was the last time you went up to one of your very close male friends and said \"lets bind our souls together\"? When was the last time you were glad to see one of your very close male christian friends that you met in secret in a field and kiss? When was the last time you gave a way your most precious possessions to your close male friend that you bound your souls with? Doesn't it seem a bit odd? When was the last time you heard at a funeral of a christian male that he loved this friend more then the love of women? If you would actually read what this man wrote with an open mind you would see but you are so sure that god condemns gay people that you are not willing to entertain the notion that God celebrates gay people.\n\n \n Ask any soldier this question about his best friend he fought with in battles and he will reflect the same sentiments as David and Jonathan do for each other. Especially since they became brothers in arms as children. Take your delusional and self serving lies elsewhere Matthew, your perversion of Gods word wont work here as long as people remain who will defend the truth.",

You prove you're an idolater as you credit Man as the originator of values which came from God and have existed since our creation.\n\n \n My like or dislike has no effect on the truth of what I have stated. You cannot say the same. I could just as easily attribute morality to God without compromising any other belief in me. Could you attribute morality to man without any other core beliefs coming into question?\n \n You revert back to the dirt monkey mentality. That man witout God would be covered in the hide of an animal wielding a tree branch and eating raw meat, having not been blessed with the knowledge of making fire. \n \n Is it idolatry to give credit where credit is due? Think about this next time you see a cross with a man on it.\n \n \nI have said it before and I'll say it again, if Man truly evolved from the lower animals then our whole system of morality as in right and wrong would be comparable to what is normal and acceptable in the animal kingdom. The carry over would be inevitable and obvious, yet you secularists don't want to consider the inconsistency in your religion of evolution which ignores the spiritual characteristics of Mans humanity and uniqueness as Gods highest creation which was made in His image.\n\n \n Why is morality not universaly understand the same all over the world and since the beginning of time? Why is right only right in some places and wrong in others? If morality is given to all mankind why must children be taught right from wrong? If morality is given from God how is man able to adapt morality to situations unknown in biblical times? Why is he able to look at Gods word on morality and do better? \n \n How can you have it both ways? We are incapable of observing and drawing conclusions based on those observations and then building upon those conclusions, but yet you would claim we are the highest creation of God. Do you attribute Democracy, computers and language to God? These just as morality were developed over time. By observing, experimenting, reasoning and the will of man. \n \n The spirituality of man has no bearing on the development of morality. It is not the reason for man's evolution, his development in logic or reasoning. \n \n If God put morality within man why was there a need to write it down? How did morality exist before he wrote it down? Why does it exist where their is no knowledge of God and why does it not exist where nothing but God is known? \n \n God had nothing to do with the development of morality in man. It is behavior that has been learned and passed down and then built upon to become what it is presently. In 500 years it will most likely look different than it now does and 1000 after that will have become more or less again. \n \n God's morality is unchanging, man's is, just as man does.",

   "The reason why your version doesn't pass the smell test is because it goes against the well and long established values which are laid out consistently in the bible. In spite of Mutz's very rational rebuttal to you where he said this, and I quote: [E Mutz said] Presuming though that D & J were homosexual, why would there relationship be so frankly described? Moreover, since Israel was still under the Levitical canon at the time which expressly forbid homosexuality how reasonable do you think it would be that David would simultaneously engage in this forbidden activity, be championed for it in the scripture, AND achieve the throne?\n \n Tell me if that sounds reasonable.\n \n Yet you come back attempting to sell us the opinion of an obviously biased source who has every personal reason to justify his own lifestyle which happens to be homosexual. And you slander me by inferring that I have some prejudicial reason for opposing what you would have us accept. The fact is Matthew that I have no personal investment at all in condemning homosexuality from a personal perspective if through my studies I believed for a second that God accepted and defended it as right and normal. If that was the case then I would be the loudest advocate you could find and would be fighting anyone who attempted to condemn it as wrong.\n \n Here's what you refuse to accept though, just as God condemns the sins of the flesh which straight people commit, He also condemns homosexuality. And if there was a group of straight men and women who created a community which held parades, lobbied for and sued in court to defend adultery in every corner of our social conscience, I would be fighting what they represent also as being against what the bible says is right and normal for our society. \n \n You are so indoctrinated into this fallacious victim mentality that you refuse to accept that my (our) opposition to homosexuality has nothing to do with being against you personally but has everything to do with opposing what homosexuality itself represents as a sinful abomination according to the values of God who made us in His image.\n\n \n \nYou are reacting exactly as the links said you would.

Something you claim is a right wing conservative position, but the reality is only as long as it is given under a strict narrowly defined set of conditions.\n\n \n Here's why your version of that is misguided. \n \n There is no liberty in sin (abortion, illicit gay sex sin, blasphemy against God's Word, disbelief, etc., etc.).\n \n Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence who was also known as the \"Father of Public Schools,\" once had this to offer: \"The only foundation for a republic is...religion. Without it there can be no virtue, and without virtue there can be no liberty.\"\n \n Don't miss the significance of that last statement: &#8220;..without virtue there can be no liberty....\" The principle is clear - a lack of virtue engenders bondage.\n \n As one writer noted, \"Intemperate men can never be free because their passions give rise to their fetters (bindings).\" The more liberties a godless people achieve, the more enslaved they ultimately become in their worldly obsessions.\n \n Still another founding father, the Reverend John Witherspoon, mirrored Benjamin Rush when he declared, \"...Civil liberty cannot long be preserved without virtue....\"\n \n Let's look at the Scriptures and see what you're trying to sweep under the rug in order to try to justify illicit gay sex sin:\n \n Leviticus 18:22 - \"Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable.\" \n \n Leviticus 20:13 - \"If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.\"\n \n Romans 1:26-27 - \"Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.\"\n \n 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 - \"Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.\"\n \n 1 Timothy 1:8-10 - &#8220;But we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully, knowing this: that the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine&#8230;&#8221;\n \n Jude 7 &#8211; &#8220;In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.&#8221; \n \n There's no gay marriages in the Old Testament; No gay marriages in the New Testament; no gay sex approved anywhere in the Bible.

God is consistent on that.\n \n And to close:\n \n &#8220;Whosoever shall be guilty of Rape, Polygamy, or Sodomy with man or woman shall be punished, if a man, by castration, if a woman, by cutting thro' the cartilage of her nose a hole of one half inch diameter at the least.&#8221; - Thomas Jefferson\n \n Amendment VIII: Thomas Jefferson, A Bill for Proportioning Crimes and Punishments",

   "Here's why your version of that is misguided.\n \n \n No it's not and this is why...\n \n \nThere is no liberty in sin (abortion, illicit gay sex sin, blasphemy against God's Word, disbelief, etc., etc.).\n\n \n That is a wonderful opinion you have there. If I shared it with you then I might agree or even if I didn't I still might agree with your views on some of your given examples. That is your right, you can not have an abortion or not have gay sex or straight sex or blasphemy or disbelieve or etc. Nobody is telling you that you have to. That is freedom and liberty. Telling people they can't do something or they must do something is not. Freedom does not equal restrictions.\n By the way why are you giving examples that support the statement you are supposed to be refuting?\n \n \n Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence who was also known as the \"Father of Public Schools,\" once had this to offer: \"The only foundation for a republic is...religion. Without it there can be no virtue, and without virtue there can be no liberty.\"\n \n \nDon't miss the significance of that last statement: &#8220;..without virtue there can be no liberty....\" The principle is clear - a lack of virtue engenders bondage.\n\n \n Gee good thing he was a Christian or this would be embarrasing. Times have changed, even 200 years ago the effects of centuries of Christian dominence in Western culture and thought was losing it's appeal. His way of thnking is what brought about Catholic schools. Thise were started in response to the Government refusing to allow Catholics to substitue their version of the bible for the Protestant version that were purchased for schools through taxes imposed on parents.\n \n Religion does not always equal virtue and virtue can exist outside of religion\n \n \nAs one writer noted, \"Intemperate men can never be free because their passions give rise to their fetters (bindings).\" The more liberties a godless people achieve, the more enslaved they ultimately become in their worldly obsessions.\n\n \n You did it again. You got sucked into a lie and bought it hook line and sinker. Why must Christians resort to these tactics?\n \n Here is the quote from your one writer Edmund Burke who is not cited in your article and the reason why is obvious\n \n \nMen are qualified for civil liberty in exact proportion to their disposition to put moral chains upon their own appetites, &#8212; in proportion as their love to justice is above their rapacity, &#8212; in proportion as their soundness and sobriety of understanding is above their vanity and presumption, &#8212; in proportion as they are more disposed to listen to the counsels of the wise and good, in preference to the flattery of knaves. Society cannot exist, unless a controlling power upon will and appetite be placed somewhere; and the less of it there is within, the more there must be without. It is ordained in the eternal constitution of things, that men of intemperate minds cannot be free. Their passions forge their fetters. \n\n \n I see no religion referenced as you have stated in your post and the second half of that quote doesn't exist as you have it.",

They do show you trying to portray my position as something it isn't. \n \n So for you consent once given cannot be taken back moments prior or during the act. Stop means stop, not hurry up and finish. Once there is no longer consent how is it not to be considered forced? \n \n Nice idea, put the burden of proof on the victim to show consent was rescinded or was not given. What about implied, how liberal are you there? \n \n You are trying to make a situation whereby forcing someone to sexually gratify another can be done without consequence. Maybe laws for you are different, but here even your cherry picked situation would not be a slam dunk rape conviction. That means your fear of someone being given a sentence harsher than the crime already has safeguards in place. All your really doing is trying to water down protections for potential victims. \n \n Giving consent does not prohibit taking it back. There is no difference once consent has been removed and continuing the act to not having been given consent at all. Consideration of circumstances is required in determining guilt and sentencing. \n \n So besides arguing out of ignorance, your honorable reasons already exist and your less than honorable motivations are just that. \n \n \nNow I know that you will say that there would be a far greater penalty between the former and latter BUT there is a mandatory sentence for rape.\n\n \n That is because to be found guilty of that crime the crime has been committed.

One person forced another person to do something they did not want to do.

That our system supposedly 'does it's best' is not a valid reason to not continue trying to improve it.\n\n \n Read my posts I am arguing against trivializing acts that are clearly worthy of punishment of some significance. I agree that there are degrees of what deserves punishment and what that punishment should be. This in my view is about defining what acts are deemed worth punishment that fits the crime, who bears responsibility and the most significant does one party have the right to decide not to proceed whether consent had been given or not. \n \n Does a passed out woman who may have given consent earlier just stupid if a man has sex with her while unconscious or if at point consent is given, but does she lose the right to say no moments before or even during. Gansao says yes to both or if it is some form of assault it merits a 5 or 10 dollar fine or something of little consequence and that is just a lesson she got to learn. \n \n Sorry I have a problem with phrases like she deserved it or what did she expect or similar thought process which makes one party's actions excusable or the responsibility of the other. \n \n My comment was based on a belief that Gansao has experienced a situation that he feels was the punishment was harsher than the crime. My comment was not that our system is the best it is going to get so no sense in trying to improve. Nor am I against punishment being something fitting for the crime, but useful in preventing reoccurrances. I don't think hard jail time or stiff dollar fines accomplish both",

That isn't where the problem lies. And if you were not so interested in being right you would acknowledge that repeatedly I have agreed and shown that there are degrees of severity for different circumstances, further showing that situation is a legal requirement to be considered in determining charges to be filed. So come up with something new or quit trying to play smoke and mirrors with the real disagreement.\n \n You feel that the definition of sexual assault or rape is to broad. That certain acts now considered as such should not be and the punishment should be fitting to your idea of what constitutes rape.\n In other words you would like to see the laws watered down or as I have stated a number of times diminished.\n \n As I have already said the severity of rape laws are reletivly new. Becoming increasingly more encompassing over the last 20 years. The reason is the laws used to be like you would make them and they didn't work. The protection the law is supposed to afford women was failing miserably and justice was absent more often than not. \n \n Again it's one thing for a woman to get drunk never say no and then have regrets in the morning. That isn't a crime, if she chose to drink of her free will and didn't think of saying no until after the man can't be blamed for that. If she passes out, besides just the weirdness of that, every law that requires consent necessitates that the consent be given by someone able to do so. Not just sex and unconscious is not a state that consent can be given. Do you really think that the best course of action is to error on the side of doing it? That used to be ok then date rape drugs came along and a lot of people got off because the laws were the way you want them to be. He said she said yes and then passed out so he did. \n \n To use your example what is deserving of a harsher penalty the guy who gets in a fight with another guy, both of whom are drunk or the guy who beats someone he finds passed out who can't even defend himself? The guy who beats the passed out guy, why because he was passed out. No different than the woman.",

Just as you feel the punishment should fit the crime does getting drunk and flirty then passing out an warrant or is it fitting that a man can have sex with her while she is passed out?\n \n To use your example what is deserving of a harsher penalty the guy who gets in a fight with another guy, both of whom are drunk or the guy who beats someone he finds passed out who can't even defend himself? The guy who beats the passed out guy, why because he was passed out and the unconscious woman is no different she can't defend herself. \n \n So that is my point, I understand yours and again don't disagree. Circumstances are relevant and are considered and I believe that at least in the US the severity of the crime and punishment are broad enough to be a deterrent and promote justice.\n\n \n OK...........\n \n \n You dont disagree that\n \n \n \n The penalties for rape should be as broad as the penalties for assault.\n \n \n Thank you",
