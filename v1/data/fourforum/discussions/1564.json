   "http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/asiapcf/auspac/01/12/aust.missile/index.html\n \n Australia is working to set up a ballistic missile defense and that in itself worries some nuclear powers such as China since having a ballistic missile defense would render their nuclear missile pointless. However the benefits to such a system are that rouge nations like North Korea wouldn't be able to easily attack other countries with nuclear weapons. This would also reduce the possibility of the world ending in one horrible nuclear war if the major powers did have some sort of ballistic missile defense.\n \n So do you think China is right in protesting that such a system be put into place or do you think Australia is right in trying to create such a system?",

First off building up more offensive weapons leads to building up of more defensive weapons.

China has some 600 nuclear weapons and Australia has nothing and know they can never make nuclear weapons as the rest of the world would not accept it. Talk about in your face, China is a constant threat to them and Australia is bound from doing anything. So using your own logic you have to believe Australia should create defensive weapons in response to this in your face tactic.\n \n So Australia creates a defensive array to protect themselves from nuclear weapons and pledges to protect any one of their allies from nuclear missiles launched from China. Now China has an obsolete nuclear missile program while their enemies can strike them with nuclear missiles at any given time. China would have two options, either create their own defensive network or try and create weapons that can bypass the current defensive curtain hanging over them. They can be certain that within a given period of time that they can develop a network similar to that of Australia and even the playing field by making themselves safe from nuclear attack or they can try and develop a weapon that currently doesn't exist and surely would cost a great deal of money and time to create while still leaving them completely open to nuclear attack. Logically China would choose the defensive option first just as a way to get rid of their main weakness.\n \n I think the world would see a massive build up of defensive weapons, especially by countries like Iran, Israel, Pakistan, India, Japan, Taiwan, Australia, US, EU, Russia, and China. These are all countries that are either top on someones to kill list or countries that simply don't have the offensive option and need to build a credible defense. This massive worldwide build up of defensive weapons would occur at a pace much faster than the build up of new offensive weapons because of how practical defensive weapons would be compared to offensive weapons. China simply could not stand by next to a US that has 20x more nuclear missiles than them as well as a nuclear shield over them. China would have to build a defensive shield of their own or risk falling to an aggressive US without being able to get a chance to fight.\n \n Of course their will be consequences to this defensive build up. Missiles and bombs of old will become useless as weapons and offensive weapons will probably have to get a lot smaller to be effective. Chemical and germ warfare, laser warfare, technological sabotage, and nanotech warfare would be the future. It may even create more wars based on the knowledge that their were 2 world wars before nuclear weapons and none since. So it is possible that things could go bad. On the other side of the coin I see that we have never really needed to worry about a countries defense as much as their offense. With offense being more powerful than defense it is really an invetation to war. If it is the other way around then war becomes infeasible and won't occur. So if defensive weapons take presidence and organizations like the UN, who wish for stability, try to keep it that way using their own influence, that could mean the end to major conflicts.\n \n There are many ways this could go if Australia builds a defensive shield but I think it is certain that allowing countries who cannot produce nuclear weapons to produce a defensive shield makes perfect sense. They have a right to protect themselves and just as China is able to do so through fear of nuclear attacks Australia should be able to by being able to defend themselves from nuclear attacks.",

Lets say China has 600 nukes and Australias system can handle 3 at a time and will be able to handle 600 at a time 3 years from now. So using your theory China will start mass producing nuclear weapons. Now it is 3 years later. China has 3,000 nukes and Australia can handle 600 nukes. However the US now has a system that can handle 2,000 nukes and other Australian allies can handle 400. So here China is 3 years later with billions of dollars spent in creating nuclear missiles and they are now totally ineffective because of the Australian's and their allies. Good money spent by the Australian's while China just wasted a bunch of money and still has to spend some money to make their own nuclear shield.\n \n Let me know if it seems like I am missing something here but it would seem to me that eventually there will be a global nuclear shield up within just a few years after one country gets a defense system in place making it pointless to build more nukes unless you are planning on using them very soon. Also note it is stupid to use nukes just before a nuclear shield goes up because you will inevitably pay for it later. For instance lets say China uses nukes on Australia, Japan, and Taiwan 3 years before the nuclear shield goes up. 3 years go by and by this time the entire world is at war and the shield is up and running and only protecting those who oppose China. China gets nuked over and over and can not do anything about it. They inevitably surrender and lose everything.\n \n I just can't see why there would be a nuclear arms race for any reason if countries start developing nuclear defenses.",

   "I can definately see an arms race. In particular in improving missiles in stealtiness and speed. Also in setting up the defenses. \n \n The same sort of thing can be seen historically in the change of aircraft bombers vs. the defences set up against them. I'm sure that many defensive developments looked as if they would kill the ability of aircraft to enter enemy space, but we still have bombers.\n \n For example, as radar got much stronger, aircraft started flying very low to the ground to hide from the ground based radar using terrain and the natural curvature of the earth. Then, air-based radar was developed, which could look downwards and pick up the low-flying planes. Aircraft development shifted to flying too high to be intercepted. (U-2 and SR-71) \n Now, stealth has basically put us back where we started.\n \n Another example is castles. (very rough historical sketch!) Earlier ones were very effective at defending. Then siege development improved and things like trebuchets could tear them down. Castles improved to the point where trebuchets were completely ineffective. Then, gunpowder, and now castles are obsolete.\n \n The point is, don't think that offensive weapons will become obsolete. They may for a while, but its not likely to hold.\n \n However, I think I support the defensive shields. \n \n My objection is that another arms race will take money away from needy people, and I think that is a serious consideration.",

Even the most backwards country can develop nuclear weapons and even the most advanced country has no way of defending themselves from nuclear attack. If we had a defensive array in place it would at least prevent nuclear weapons from being the end all be all. We would have some sort of balance and places like the United States couldn't be threatened by rogue nations like North Korea because of their ability to develop a nuclear bomb.\n \n I also wonder what type of arms race we would really see. First off I think we would see a massive build up of a worldwide defensive net. That in itself is a major step towards peace. Without the threat of nuclear weapons we no longer have to fear countries who have nothing to lose like North Korea starting a world war. Then we are back to only the major players being in control of wars and of course each of them has something to lose by starting a war. Even if we are all able to develop newer and better weapons that can defeat our own defenses at least the rogue nations will not be able to do so as well and that is a good thing for peace. As for cost, I think the lost of Los Angeles would be greater than that of building an entire nuclear net at the end of the day.",

Besides which, a rogue nation would almost certainly ship the stuff over in a crate, and have it already planted anywhere they wanted to.\n\n \n First off lets compare shipping a nuke to launching one. With shipping a nuke we do have a first line of defense and have a chance of preventing it from arriving in the first place. With launching a nuke we have no defense at this time. Secondly the size of the nukes shipped will have to be smaller than one that can be launched. And finally nukes that are shipped will have to be detonated from low altitudes meaning they will do substancially less damage than one that is launched.

There is an 80% chance we will pick the wrong ones and the nuke will get through.\n\n \n I agree with this as far as it concerns missiles. Defensive missiles simply will not do in the long run because of the reasons you listed here. Sure they are effective in picking off missiles which are going in a straight line as well as those which are just being launched but they cannot deal with multiple targets nor can they deal well with evasive missiles. A missile based defense would have it's place but it will not be an effective way of creating a worldwide missile shield. The best solution is one that we have yet to near perfecting and that is laser based. The US has been tinkering with laser based missile defense for years now and has only shown limited success. They have already succeeded in shooting down two simulated nuclear missiles within a matter of seconds but they have failed far more than that and the laser is bluky, expensive, and takes time to power up. Advances will have to be made in this field to create a truely effective missile defense. Still I would debate that having a missile based system for now is a great deterent to nuclear attacks and it will save lives either through deterence or by shooting down missiles. It is a far better solution than what we currently have which is Mutually Assured Destruction.\n \n \nIn terms of money, the Star Wars defense system then becomes a complete waste. If all countries like China have to do to get past our defense shield is build dummy missiles, then they will outprice us. That is, if we continue trying to build more defense missiles, they will build more dummy missiles. Dummy missiles will cost so much less than defensive missiles that we will risk destabilising the economy by attempting to keep up.\n\n \n You make a good point here. The strategy of using dummy missiles would be an effective way to get around our defense. It would be a cost effective way to beat the system for a country like China or any other major country. The only question to be posed then is would China actually attempt to use this type of strategy. First lets assume China wanted to attack the US with nuclear weapons. They have to assume that a massive attack by them would be answered back with a equal or greater force. They have only 600 nukes to our 9,000. They would have no choice but to launch in great numbers in order to break the shield which would ensure that they be retaliated against by thousands of nuclear weapons of which none will be shot down while the US may shoot some of theirs down. So China would be left with two choices. Either a full nuclear attack and get blown away or no attack at all. This would limit China to only going to nuclear war if they were prepared to be totally eliminated unlike is the case today where they could launch a single nuke and take out a Los Angeles and expect only a few nukes back at them. It eliminates the likelihood of China using nuclear weapons even in a major conflict as they would have to go all out or face inevitable failure.\n \n Although I think that is a nice perk to this system, as I said before I am more interested in this system to prevent rogue nations from becoming nuclear threats than I am concerned about superpowers going nuclear. As it stands today I don't see it as very likely that a superpower will engage in a nuclear war because defeat would be inevitable for both sides. I would also debate that the closest anyone has ever come to launching a nuclear missile was Cuba because they simply had nothing to lose. Those are the real threats and this shield would take care of them for the most part.\n \n \nThis also doesn't take into account other techniques the enemy could use such as equipting missiles with flares to detour incoming defense missiles. If they can reduce the efficiency of the missiles, we will require more of them and yet again we will be spending more money.\n \n If we continued such an arms race we would go bankrupt just like the soviet union did.\n\n \n I don't think that a shield would end up depending totally on missiles otherwise there would be too many ways to defeat it. Also if the US set out to make this shield by themselves then you could debate they could go bankrupt but if this became a project which was carried out cooperatively by many countries throughout the world then it would lessen the burden while making it more likely that every country will support the idea of this shield. This in itself would promote peace and unity.",

It has prevented the world's superpowers waging war on each other during the last 50 years. You point this out yourself whe you mention that China would never launch nuclear weapons at the US due to the nuclear arms the US has. This also counts for convential war too, China is never even going to consider a full out conventional attack and invasion of the US because they know that even if they can win the conventional war, the US will retaliate against their country with nukes and ultimately noone will win.\n \n If you start making missile shields that work, then other countries such as China will also start making them. It might seem a world under a nuclear shield would be a paradise without threat from nuclear world war, but it wouldn't be. As soon as the nuclear blanket is put in place, militaries around the world would start gearing up for conventional warfare on a huge scale. \n \n It is my opinion that the drive for a nuclear defense shield is soley because North Korea will soon possess nuclear weapons and the missiles to carry them. They will of course continue building more nukes if they think their deterent is ineffective. I can only imagine then that he star wars project is simply a way of sinking NK into extreme debt and collapse by triggering an arms race with them\n \n Also lasers in space is a nice idea but they can be dual use.
