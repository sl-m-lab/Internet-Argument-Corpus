   "In a parallel train of thought; it saddens me to think back on all the bad things that Liberalism has done to this Country. The worst problem America faces today is liberalism. They have dumbed down education, they have defined deviancy down. Liberals have attacked every major institution that made America great. From the Boy Scouts to the military; from education to religion. The major news outlets have become the propaganda arm of the Democrat party. Liberals are evil, they embrace the tenets of Kak Marx, they're Marxist, socialist, communists.\n\n nihilix: Unitarian Shooter Jim Adkisson's Hate Crime Suicide Note\n \n \nThe following books were found in Adkisson's home during a police search:\n \n * Liberalism is a Mental Disorder by radio talk show host Michael Savage\n * Let Freedom Ring: Winning the War of Liberty over Liberalism by talk show host Sean Hannity\n * The O'Reilly Factor: The Good, the Bad, and the Completely Ridiculous in American Life by television talk show host Bill O'Reilly\n \n In his letter, Adkisson also included the Democratic members of the House and Senate, and the 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America of Bernard Goldberg in his list of wished-for targets.\n\n Knoxville Unitarian Universalist church shooting - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",

Just because people disagree with you doesn't make them racists, radicals, or extremists. All you have to go on is your obvious hatred for people who disagree with you, and your dogmatic attitude. You constantly point fingers and categorize anyone and everyone who disagrees with you as either racists, extremists, or threats. Didn't your mother ever tell you than when you point a finger at somebody, you have three fingers pointing back at you? If you would listen with your ears rather than your mouth, you might learn that what you believe about right-wingers isn't true. You should really stop writing threats until you have an actual point to make rather than your typical, mindless ranting.",

   "SnakeSpit, score one, You've found an evil Democrat:\n \nGacy became active in the local Democratic Party, first volunteering to clean the party offices. In 1975 and 1976, he served on the Norwood Park Township street lighting committee. He eventually earned the title of precinct captain. In this capacity, he met and was photographed with First Lady Rosalynn Carter, who was in town for the annual Polish Constitution Day Parade, held on May 6, 1978. Gacy was directing the parade that year, for the third year in a row. Carter posed for pictures with Gacy and autographed the photo \"To John Gacy. Best Wishes. Rosalynn Carter\". In the picture, Gacy is wearing an \"S\" pin, indicating a person who has received special clearance by the United States Secret Service. During the search of Gacy's house after his arrest, this photo caused a major embarrassment to the Secret Service.\n\n John Wayne Gacy - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n Find some more.",
