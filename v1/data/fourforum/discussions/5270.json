   "No really, this force you speak of, is it not the will to survive?\n To ensure the survival of your progeny?\n\n No, that force is the inner man, given by God and yearns to return to God. In order for that to happen we must follow Him - to do that we must believe in Him.\n \nVerse? \n I don't doubt you, I'd just like to see this written in the Bible.\n Where does it say the soul is passed down through generations?\n And where does it say that Eve got her soul from Adam?\n\n Ezekiel 18:4, the Lord says,  All souls are mine...\n When the Bible said that Adam \"became\" a living soul, it meant that God had given him both spirit and soul and all those that came afterwards. No one can inherit a spirit and soul from another human being - they get their own as God chooses. This inner force is a life source of it's own and can live forever or be cast into the outer darkness and destroyed. God doesn't give souls and spirits to mankind for us to squander or trade for something temporary; He gives it with instructions to do certain things and to return to Him.\n \nI saw something that resembled a duck.\n It looked like one, quacked like one...\n\n Similar-ness is not sameness. Everyone, at one point in time, has heard the mournful coo of a dove, but it does not imply that the bird is sad.\n \nEspecially in myself.\n I've seen nothing in me that seems supernatural.\n\n I can only encourage you to look again. The Bible tells us in Zechariah 12:1 that God formed our spirits in us. He didn't do this that we should live as animals that struggle each day to overcome starvation, but to fill ourselves with His Spirit so that we can be a vessel unto Him, sanctified, and prepared to do His work.\n \nWell, it's half the battle, for sure!\n\n Unfortunately, due to my own ignorance, it was a battle.\n \nSo, your'e saying that one day, we might be able to \"see\" animals emotions?\n I agree. We just might do that.\n\n That's not what I'm saying and you know it.\n \nI walked by a squirrel today, lot's of em.\n He didn't get upset and run until I looked him in the eye,\n he wrongly assumed that looking at him means I wanted to eat him.\n He ran out of fear.\n \n He was eating a nut, surely he enjoyed it.\n \n Love and abhor will have to wait.\n \n These aren't \"proofs\" but you can't prove to me that you do any of these things either. You can tell me that you do, but that's far from proof.\n \n But you don't think animals are capable of these emotions?\n \n Maybe you think there are \"higher\" emotions and \"lower\" emotions?\n Surely some are more nuansced than others, but all emotions are very animalistic. I think there is something advantageous to taking the Vulcan stance on certain things. Emotion is usually a detriment, an impediment, a consequence of being mortal. If we can consciously overcome it, we will truly be something more than an animal. \n\n I'm not saying that emotions are good or bad, but human emotions are very distinct (good and bad, and sometimes erratic) depending on the influences of good and evil on that person's mind, spirit, and soul.\n \nNo she wasn't.\n Adam was made from dirt, she was made from Adam's rib.\n He breathed the breth of life into Adam but not Eve.\n How is that the same treatment?\n\n Giving a spirit and soul to Adam, as I stated before, started the whole thing. All that came afterwards were given that same treatment.\n \nWhere does it say this?\n\n See Ezekiel scripture above. Even though the Bible doesn't come right and say, \"God gave everyone a spirit and soul from His warehouse of spirit and souls...\", it certainly implies it throughout. \n \nIt also does not say that animals don't have a soul.\n It just doesn't mention it.\n\n \nOnly with the preface \"According to the Bible...\" :)\n\n I'll pass then...\n \nThen women don't have souls. \n (by your interpretation, either animals quite possibly have souls, or neither women nor animals have souls)\n\n Not quite; that's your interpretation.\n \n Let me say this: There is a life-force in animals, but is unlike that which God wants to return to Him. I am not in anyway challenging those who have seen ghosts of cats and dogs on the porch or in their houses, nor am I saying that there will be no animals in Heaven. That part of man that lives forever or that gets destroyed is different than the life-force that resides in animals. Some may say that animals have spirits and souls and I certainly have no proof that they do or that they don't, but the Bible makes it clear that God places human beings much higher than He does any animal, and that we are His \"children\". The Lord states, \"...every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle on a thousand hills.\" (Psalms 50:10), but it also states that we (humans) are His most precious creations and that He loves us so much that He gave His own Son to die a horrible death so that we could live forever if we so choose. He did not do this for animals.",

   "No, that force is the inner man, given by God and yearns to return to God. In order for that to happen we must follow Him - to do that we must believe in Him.\n\n Well, I can't say I've ever heard of the \"inner man\" theory.\n \n \n \nEzekiel 18:4, the Lord says,  All souls are mine...\n\n Yeah, that's all it says.\n It doesn't say anything about every human having a soul or that animals don't have a soul. It just says that there is more than two souls and that they belong to God. \n \n Now bear with me, the NIV version of Gen 1:30 is:\n \nAnd to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air and all the creatures that move on the ground-everything that has the breath of life in it-I give every green plant for food.\" And it was so.\n\n The KJV:\n \nAnd to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.\n\n Young's Literal Translation:\n \nand to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the heavens, and to every creeping thing on the earth, in which [is] breath of life, every green herb [is] for food:' and it is so.\n\n \n I'll stick with the literal translation.\n \n Here it implies that almost all if not all creeping things on the earth have the breath of life. The breath of life is supposedly where Adam got his soul.\n So, if animals have it, then they must have souls.\n \n Oh, and btw, in the literal translation, here is Genesis 2:7\n \nAnd Jehovah God formeth the man -- dust from the ground, and breatheth into his nostrils breath of life, and the man becometh a living creature.\n\n No mention of a soul here. Only that Adam was a living creature.\n \n \n -----\n \n\n When the Bible said that Adam \"became\" a living soul, it meant that God had given him both spirit and soul and all those that came afterwards.\n\n That's not the way I read it.\n I can mean that Adam was a soul previous to receiving the breath of life, but afterwards he was a living soul. \n But this is only in KJV and other translations, likely not in the original language.\n \n \nNo one can inherit a spirit and soul from another human being - they get their own as God chooses. \n\n I didn't see where this idea is expressed in the Bible.\n \"The soul of the father and the soul of the son\" implies that everyone gets their own soul, but not necessarily so. But then judgment wouldn't make much sense if people had common souls (only when soul=person). If an individual is held accountable for his actions, the judgement is carried out on his soul, I suppose, as if the soul were simply the person's mind and not something supernatural. \n \n \nThis inner force is a life source of it's own and can live forever or be cast into the outer darkness and destroyed. God doesn't give souls and spirits to mankind for us to squander or trade for something temporary; He gives it with instructions to do certain things and to return to Him.\n\n I guess there's no way to tell if god has given instructions to animals too.\n And if their souls have a similar purpose.\n \n\n Similar-ness is not sameness. Everyone, at one point in time, has heard the mournful coo of a dove, but it does not imply that the bird is sad.\n\n Hmm, yeah, I never got sadness from a dove's call. {shrug}\n Well, more familiar animals, like our domesticated pals show their emotions all the time. Dogs are full of emotion. Just leave the house and they get instantly depressed. Seperation anxiety in dogs is profound. I know my dog expresses his utter joy every time I grab the leash. He knows we're going somewhere besides the boring house. If he sees me playing with another dog or giving the other dog a treat, he'll get really jealous and you can tell.\n \n But, of course, it's not the same, just like my emotions can't be the same as your emotions. Surely we feel them differently. You might have emotions that I don't. I doubt we have enough knowlege in this area.\n \n \nI can only encourage you to look again. The Bible tells us in Zechariah 12:1 that God formed our spirits in us. He didn't do this that we should live as animals that struggle each day to overcome starvation, but to fill ourselves with His Spirit so that we can be a vessel unto Him, sanctified, and prepared to do His work.\n\n \nThe burden of the word of the LORD for Israel, saith the LORD, which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him.\n\n Why should I believe that \"spirit\" = \"soul\" ?\n I guess that's all one can assume.\n So all this says is that God forms the spirit of man, and says nothing about the spirit of animals.\n \n And all I was saying is that, despite Zechariah, I have yet to find anything supernatural in myself.\n \n \n \nThat's not what I'm saying and you know it.\n\n Oh, I think one day we'll be able to map thoughts using instruments.\n Then we could compare the brains of different species to see what the similarities and differences are.\n \n\n I'm not saying that emotions are good or bad, but human emotions are very distinct (good and bad, and sometimes erratic) depending on the influences of good and evil on that person's mind, spirit, and soul.\n\n See, here you've seperated mind, spirit, soul. The bible didn't do this, unless Zechariah is being misinterpreted. It basically said, in your interpretation, that the spirit and the soul are the same thing.\n \n But why shouldn't emotions be hormonal/neural responses to stimuli?\n Emotions are a response to \"good/bad\" physical stimuli, why do they have to involve supernatural good/evil, souls, and such?\n (by physical, I also mean psychological and mental)\n \n \nGiving a spirit and soul to Adam, as I stated before, started the whole thing. All that came afterwards were given that same treatment.\n\n How do you know this?\n It doesn't say this in the Bible.\n It talks about forming the spirit of FATHER and SON, but never about mother and daughter. It also doesn't say that spirit=soul.\n \n \nSee Ezekiel scripture above. Even though the Bible doesn't come right and say, \"God gave everyone a spirit and soul from His warehouse of spirit and souls...\", it certainly implies it throughout.\n\n See, here you say spirit and soul are seperate things.\n And it doesn't imply that they are the same.\n It does say man and son throughout, leaving women out of it altogether (because they don't have spirits or souls).\n \n \n \nNot quite; that's your interpretation.\n\n It's not MY interpretation. Mine involves fallibility of the bible.\n \n \nLet me say this: There is a life-force in animals, but is unlike that which God wants to return to Him.

He did not do this for animals.\n\n No creature ate from the tree of knowlege except for humans.\n They didn't sin and don't sin.\n God says he \"loves us so much\" like we are the stupid kid that has a learning problem and needs remedial classes. We were the one's who screwed up, the deliquents. God supposedly had to fix this mess, by sending himself down in the form of his own son in the form of a human. Every beast of the forest is His, just as every soul of men is his. God gave man \"dominion\" because man has to prove to god that he can handle the job. Animals don't have to worry about these things, they didn't sin and the fate of their soul is guaranteed.",

To point out which is which would take quite awhile, but it can be done.\n\n Yes, doing a search in the literal translation gives 62 references to \"soul\" in the Torah alone. So, I suppose one could determine what the god of the bible means by \"soul\" although I would think something so important wouldn't be so ambiguous. I would think that it would be very plain about what a soul is and what you have to do with it, since it's pretty much the whole point of the bible, to get your soul into heaven.\n \n\n Yes, it does infer that doesn't it, but as I said earlier you have to read it thoroughly in order to see that there is a physical and spiritual make-up to all human beings.\n\n What about a spiritual make-up for non-humans?\n One could read it thoroughly and probably see that there is a spiritual make-up to everything.\n \n\n Despite our inability to distinguish the difference, mainly due to the fact that most simply disbelieve, God reaches out for our spirits in order to change our souls.

I think some Christians here may even have a different idea than I do. But, since I have the floor and am responsible for only my posts, then my belief is what is in question. Right?\n \n\n Yes, this is what I'm saying.\n The \"soul\" and the \"spirit\" are the whole point of the bible's existence.\n if it can't be plain about what they are and what to do with them, \n then either god is a terrible author, \n or (and this is the one you'll like) we are terrible readers. \n Either way, god isn't making the instructions very clear.\n \n \n\n Since the message of the Gospel pertains on a one-on-one relationship with the Lord, then that, itself, implies that we each have our own spirit-man living inside us, which btw, is actually who we really are...\n\n Yeah, that would make sense. \n If you have to keep inventory of souls it wouldn't make sense to punish a soul that one body made proper usage of and another body didn't.\n But then again, it's the soul that affects us not the other way around.\n Well, the bible implies that we can affect the soul, but...\n \n \nNot in the Bible.\n\n Right, so animals might very well have souls.\n \n \n\n All I can say here is that we may display those emotions differently, but we both can, logically, express the same emotions.\n \n\n We don't know that.\n I don't even know if we see the same colors, or if they are all jumbled up and we just call them the same thing. The wavelength of light is the same, but our brains may interpret with slight differences. I don't think we have a way of knowing these things.\n \n \nI'm not going to form an opinion on what you should believe other than that in which the Bible states. When the Bible states that we were made in God's image, then it's clear to me that our spiritual bodies will be, at least similar, to our physical bodies. Our souls, according to the Gospel, should be transformed to that of God.\n\n In his image can mean so many things.\n I don't know how you extrapolate that the soul looks like the body and that the soul will eventually become the soul of god. Oh, and does god have a soul? Would he need one since no one is there to judge him and to punish/reward his soul accordingly? Of course he's got a \"spirit\", we all know about that one. \n \n\n Measure emotions with something...maybe fine-tune them...maybe manipulate them? Keen idea... And it may very well happen. As a matter of fact it already has happened to many of us and didn't cost us a thing.\n\n Not sure what you are talking about here...\n What did you use to measure emotions, fine-tune and manipulate them?\n \n \nYes, it is very hard, even for theologians, to explain.\n\n If the bible is truly the word of god that everyone should follow, why does it take an expert to understand it? especially regarding the all-important soul?\n \n \nI'm not saying that they can't, but that the mind of man controls the man, the mind is influenced by the soul. The soul is influenced by either good or evil, since both are beyond the natural.\n\n So we don't have influence over our soul?\n How can we serve god with all our souls as it tells us in Deuteronomy 11:13?\n `And it hath been -- if thou hearken diligently unto My commands which I am commanding you to-day, to love Jehovah your God, and to serve Him with all your heart, and with all your soul --\n or a few verses down where we place his words on our hearts and souls\n `And ye have placed these my words on your heart, and on your soul, and have bound them for a sign on your hand, and they have been for frontlets between your eyes;\n \n \n\n I have to watch for snares now? :)\n I didn't say it, nor does the Bible, that only males of the human race have souls.\n\n Well, assuming that when the Bible says \"you\" in passages that are telling \"you\" to do something with your soul, I would hope that it also applies to women. But it never comes out and says \"women and men have souls.\" \n This doesn't mean they don't have them.\n Same thing with animals. \n The book isn't written for non-humans, so when it says \"you\" we can assume it doesn't refer to non-humans. \n But the book never says \"animals don't have souls.\"\n So we can't assume that they don't (according to the bible).\n \n \nSurely you're not implying that animals are better off than we are...?\n I'm not real sure that I want to get into that, but to be honest...no they didn't sin and can't sin. But, I just haven't seen it in scripture where God does anything for the sake of all animals.\n\n I didn't say they were better off on Earth.\n (Some are, my dog eats better than some ethiopians.)\n But, what's earth matter? \n For most animals, their Earthly experience is fleeting (as is ours).\n They are here to be God's helpers.\n Some of them originally not only provided us with sustenance but a way to atone for our humanly sins.\n They should be exalted.\n They gave their lives so that we may be free of sin, sounds familiar.\n \n And the bible is written for humans, not animals.\n Wherever god communicates with animals is where they learn about what god does for them.\n \n But we were the only sinning species, so God has to give us extra help.\n That's why he did everything he did for our sake.\n We are inferior sinners.\n Animals are superior non-sinners.\n Don't let Earthly appearances fool you.",

   "Yes, doing a search in the literal translation gives 62 references to \"soul\" in the Torah alone. So, I suppose one could determine what the god of the bible means by \"soul\" although I would think something so important wouldn't be so ambiguous. I would think that it would be very plain about what a soul is and what you have to do with it, since it's pretty much the whole point of the bible, to get your soul into heaven.\n\n I have used this message at times, which has brought more than my fair share of ridicule, but, it is the Spirit of God that helps us understand and removes that ambiguity. We are taught to always pray for His help before reading the Bible in order for the words to actually \"come alive\". Explaining it to others that don't request His help is almost impossible - maybe that's way it's meant to be so that the powers of darkness can't manipulate the message so freely.\n \nWhat about a spiritual make-up for non-humans?\n One could read it thoroughly and probably see that there is a spiritual make-up to everything.\n\n It does say that He has shown Himself to us through all His creation, but that doesn't mean that God lives in rocks and trees and animals. The Bible only states that He will place His Spirit in us (humans).\n \nDo you mean that we have an inability to distinguish the phrases:\n \"living creature\"\n and\n \"living soul\" ??\n \n It seems the translators of the KJV and some others had this inability.\n Maybe they were unbelievers.\n\n Without being one with the Lord, yes, we are unable to see the things of God. It really doesn't matter who translates the \"words\", it only matters how the Word is translated into us, which translates the soul, which transforms the spirit, which in turn gives us a new, more abundant life while still in our fleshly bodies. That is the whole purpose of the Holy Bible.\n \nYes, this is what I'm saying.\n The \"soul\" and the \"spirit\" are the whole point of the bible's existence.\n if it can't be plain about what they are and what to do with them, \n then either god is a terrible author, \n or (and this is the one you'll like) we are terrible readers. \n Either way, god isn't making the instructions very clear.\n\n We are terrible followers of instructions when it comes to absolute authority. Something about pride...\n But, again, we have an advocate in Jesus, who told us that it is not the natural man that needs a doctor, but the spiritual man that does. He said that He came not for those that are healthy, but for those that are sick - to me this means those that need medicine - that being a full dose of His Spirit. \n But, back to the point: To me the Bible is telling us that God is a spirit, thus it is required that we communicate to him in the spirit...our spirit-man. The soul is the part that communicates to God once we place our spirits in the right position.\n \nYeah, that would make sense. \n If you have to keep inventory of souls it wouldn't make sense to punish a soul that one body made proper usage of and another body didn't.\n But then again, it's the soul that affects us not the other way around.\n Well, the bible implies that we can affect the soul, but...\n\n We are on the outside what our insides are. Make sense?\n \nRight, so animals might very well have souls.\n\n Okay, I'm going let you have that one...but please don't make me choke it down. :)\n \nWe don't know that.\n I don't even know if we see the same colors, or if they are all jumbled up and we just call them the same thing. The wavelength of light is the same, but our brains may interpret with slight differences. I don't think we have a way of knowing these things.\n\n It makes perfect sense and is logical. That's all I'm saying. Wouldn't you agree?\n \nIn his image can mean so many things.\n I don't know how you extrapolate that the soul looks like the body and that the soul will eventually become the soul of god. Oh, and does god have a soul? Would he need one since no one is there to judge him and to punish/reward his soul accordingly? Of course he's got a \"spirit\", we all know about that one. \n\n If it means anything in the Bible other than \"representative\" or \"likeness\", then I haven't seen it.\n I said spiritual bodies look like our physical bodies. Our soul, which to me means the mind of our spirits (for the lack of a better definition), is that which contains the power of free will. We are given that power by God, but are asked (not demanded) to transform it from worldly things to Heavenly things by allowing the \"mind of Christ\" to take over.\n \nNot sure what you are talking about here...\n What did you use to measure emotions, fine-tune and manipulate them?\n\n I was referring to the many experiments aimed at controlling the human mind. I can't seem to be sarcastic enough... :)\n I'm sure you know about MKULTRA (CIA mind control), Electromagnetic Spectrums, Microwave Technology, Psychotronics Weapons (sp?), and Human Auditory Response to Pulsed EM Energy, etc., etc.\n My last reply dealt with how some of our minds have been changed by the Lord, the way we see things, how we live in joy in the face of sorrow, etc.\n Sometimes I smile when I type (in a happy sort of way) but you can't see from over there. :) I need to use smileys more, I reckon.\n \nIf the bible is truly the word of god that everyone should follow, why does it take an expert to understand it? especially regarding the all-important soul?\n\n I've already answered that and, like I said, seems to put folks off, but it's the truth.\n \nSo we don't have influence over our soul?\n How can we serve god with all our souls as it tells us in Deuteronomy 11:13?\n `And it hath been -- if thou hearken diligently unto My commands which I am commanding you to-day, to love Jehovah your God, and to serve Him with all your heart, and with all your soul --\n or a few verses down where we place his words on our hearts and souls\n `And ye have placed these my words on your heart, and on your soul, and have bound them for a sign on your hand, and they have been for frontlets between your eyes;\n\n Our human minds have the power of free will. We are \"of the world\", hence are desirous of earthly things. We're born with it. The kicker is knowledge, then wisdom; it allows us to use that free will in a positive way, enabling us to see that there is another life beyond this temporal one and how to obtain it. That's why we need to have His Word in us, so that it can be absorbed, if you will, into our soul. Once this happens we have a transformed spirit that lives according to His instructions. All this equals a new life, basically.\n \nWell, assuming that when the Bible says \"you\" in passages that are telling \"you\" to do something with your soul, I would hope that it also applies to women. But it never comes out and says \"women and men have souls.\" \n This doesn't mean they don't have them.\n Same thing with animals. \n The book isn't written for non-humans, so when it says \"you\" we can assume it doesn't refer to non-humans. \n But the book never says \"animals don't have souls.\"\n So we can't assume that they don't (according to the bible).\n\n We are all \"spirits and souls\" to God. He loves who we really are, and the inner man (male and female) is who we really are. There is no male/female in the deal. There are no homosexual/heterosexual, or pervert, or red-, yellow-, black-, and white-skinned people. There is only the inner man, which I also refer to spirit-man, that lives after this flesh has gone away. It is this person that God desires to be in Heaven with Him. That's why He has given us strict instructions on how to \"make the trip\".\n \nI didn't say they were better off on Earth.\n (Some are, my dog eats better than some ethiopians.)\n But, what's earth matter? \n For most animals, their Earthly experience is fleeting (as is ours).\n They are here to be God's helpers.\n Some of them originally not only provided us with sustenance but a way to atone for our humanly sins.\n They should be exalted.\n They gave their lives so that we may be free of sin, sounds familiar.\n\n I love my stock, my dogs, my cats...and they do seem as if they understand me, and know when I'm happy or if I'm having a bad day, but I just can't see them stepping up to the plate to \"get me home\". I'm not slighting anyone, for their love of their own pet may be something beyond what I might consider normal, but it still doesn't seem to me that animals are a part of our overall plan to get to Heaven. Pets most certainly bring happiness to me and others but that's not what we're talking about...right?\n \nAnd the bible is written for humans, not animals.\n\n True.\n \nWherever god communicates with animals is where they learn about what god does for them.\n\n Whenever God communicates through animals it is for our sake, not theirs. Numbers 22:28 talks about a talking donkey, that God finally had to use in order to get Balaam's attention.\n \nBut we were the only sinning species, so God has to give us extra help.\n That's why he did everything he did for our sake.\n We are inferior sinners.\n Animals are superior non-sinners.\n Don't let Earthly appearances fool you.\n\n Again, if that's the way you feel, okay, but don't expect me to milk that cow... :)",

Don't hear that term too often. Do you mean cattle? \n Whatever they are, if they are used for food, I can't imagine becoming attached to an animal that will be slaughtered. I don't have anything against eating meat, believe me, but I just could never befriend any animal that I knew would meet his end soon. I'd have to keep my distance. I guess I'm a poussay. But that's modern life. People are well seperated from these things.\n \n I recently came across this study done about cows, how one cow can hold a grudge against another cow and so forth. For the life of me I can't find a link.\n Anyway, that's neither here nor there, but I thought it was interesting. \n \n Anyway, I hope you don't judge \"your\" critters on the basis of whether they'd help you or not. A cat maybe not, but a dog, if he knew the situation would risk or give his life for you. They are utterly devoted to the leader. Hell, my dog is totally in love with me (I love him too, of course.) And I hope to never be faced with this situation, but I would give my life for him too, if I could be guaranteed that he would survive. I know dogs don't live that long, but that's not the point.\n \n But, still, I don't judge any animal as to what his use to me is.\n I treat them as equals the best I can. I don't mean I treat them as humans. I just mean I treat them as if their life had as much value as mine, which they do.\n \n \n \n\n I'm not slighting anyone, for their love of their own pet may be something beyond what I might consider normal, but it still doesn't seem to me that animals are a part of our overall plan to get to Heaven. Pets most certainly bring happiness to me and others but that's not what we're talking about...right?\n\n Yeah, we really weren't talking about pets so much as we were talking about how \"good\" or \"bad\" animals have it.\n \n I'd take a clue from:\n \nlook to the fowls of the heaven, for they do not sow, nor reap, nor gather into storehouses, and your heavenly Father doth nourish them; are not ye much better than they?\n\n And since he asked a question, I'll anwer with NO.\n We cannot be better than they.\n They do not want, the lord doth provide.\n But with man:\n \nAnd to the man He said, `Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and dost eat of the tree concerning which I have charged thee, saying, Thou dost not eat of it, cursed [is] the ground on thine account; in sorrow thou dost eat of it all days of thy life,\n\n The lord doth not provide. Man must toil and in sorrow eat of the ground.\n \nand Jesus saith to him, `The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven places of rest, but the Son of Man hath not where he may lay the head.'\n\n \n So animals in general are provided for by god, man is not.\n \n The one's who really have it bad are some of the one's under man's control.\n Animals in factory farms live short, hellish lives by the hand of man.\n \n\n Whenever God communicates through animals it is for our sake, not theirs. Numbers 22:28 talks about a talking donkey, that God finally had to use in order to get Balaam's attention.\n\n I'm sorry, I have never come across this story before.\n This is classic.\n I love this story, I will share it!!\n I can see him telling his friends about it \n \"Today, God spoke through my XXX!\"\n \n But, seriously, this story is truly silly in every respect.\n Why did the angel with the sword get so angry with Balaam?\n Why did he expect him to go wherever the donkey went?\n If balaam didn't see the angel, why should the angel expect him to do what he wants? \n It's silly.\n It's like a children's story.\n The donkey spoke to him and he didn't freak out or anything,\n he just answered her.\n \n High comedy!\n \n Oh, and the donkey saw the angel all the time, but the Lord had to intervene, open Balaam's eyes to see the angel. \n Animals are closer to the Lord than humans.\n \n \nAgain, if that's the way you feel, okay, but don't expect me to milk that cow... :)\n\n That's ok, just don't beat your donkey, she may only be doing what the lord asks her to do.\n \n Maybe that's what this passage is trying to tell you.",

There is a mystery associated with the message, however, but not in the way you propose. Even the Old Testament, which spoke of Jesus' coming, was given to mankind as a mystery. Only when we let go of this life and embrace \"Christ in us\" or the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, will the Bible actually come to life.

(see Mark 4:11)\n \nI don't know, there are people who are honestly trying to follow, trying their best and they can't fully. I doubt these people are too prideful. I just think they have a hard time understanding the ambiguity and vageuness.\n\n Is it not written in the Bible that we should repent of our sins and ask the Holy Spirit to come into our lives? Why try so hard to understand when the \"Understander\" is willing and ready to do His job? We must follow the instructions first and then, when we have that understanding, we can proceed with whatever judgment we feel necessary.\n \nI don't know.

Since I believe this to be literal, it is only logical that our spirit should be also. No one has ever seen their own spirit, per se, but that which is reflected via their character.\n \nThat is the truth, that the Bible's message isn't very clear without expert explanation.\n\n I would not stop there, though. I would extend that to say that only God can make that clarity known to us.\n \nI thought the soul looked like the body.\n Then there should be white and black souls (of course Ray Charles was all about soul) as well as male and female souls?\n\n We form, so to speak, our own character based on what we believe and how that belief affects us. But, our fleshly bodies cannot change the \"form\" of our spirit. All mankind has the same \"type\" of spirit. That certain and unique spirit can, however, be influenced by whatever principality or power we allow to guide our physical lives. In short, what our spirits and souls endure or are exposed to can drastically change our lives...and our physical appearances - if you will allow me that conjecture. I only say that because of what I've seen the past few years. I have no way of proving that, but those who have been around others that have been rescued from the powers of darkness can vouch for me.\n \nYour stock? Don't hear that term too often. Do you mean cattle?\n\n Yes, horses, cattle, hogs, etc. As of this moment I am down to five horses, two cats, and a dog. :)\n \nWhatever they are, if they are used for food, I can't imagine becoming attached to an animal that will be slaughtered. I don't have anything against eating meat, believe me, but I just could never befriend any animal that I knew would meet his end soon. I'd have to keep my distance. I guess I'm a poussay. But that's modern life. People are well seperated from these things.\n\n I can see your point, but if you don't \"care\" for the animals you raise - despite their function - it could turn into a miserable venture. Sometimes we take better care of our stock than some folks do their own family members.\n \nI recently came across this study done about cows, how one cow can hold a grudge against another cow and so forth. For the life of me I can't find a link.\n Anyway, that's neither here nor there, but I thought it was interesting. \n\n I have seen that a time or two - but only in horses when a herd boss was moved into a pasture where the pecking order had previously been established and strictly enforced.\n \nAnyway, I hope you don't judge \"your\" critters on the basis of whether they'd help you or not. A cat maybe not, but a dog, if he knew the situation would risk or give his life for you. They are utterly devoted to the leader. Hell, my dog is totally in love with me (I love him too, of course.)\n\n Devoted? Yes. In love? I can't see how you can determine that.\n \nAnd I hope to never be faced with this situation, but I would give my life for him too, if I could be guaranteed that he would survive. I know dogs don't live that long, but that's not the point.\n\n I doubt that I could ever do that.\n \nBut, still, I don't judge any animal as to what his use to me is.\n I treat them as equals the best I can. I don't mean I treat them as humans. I just mean I treat them as if their life had as much value as mine, which they do.\n\n You're not alone thinking this way, but since our belief systems tend to take different paths, I can't agree.\n \nYeah, we really weren't talking about pets so much as we were talking about how \"good\" or \"bad\" animals have it.\n \n I'd take a clue from: (Matthew, Genesis, Matthew)\n \n And since he asked a question, I'll anwer with NO.\n We cannot be better than they.\n They do not want, the lord doth provide.\n \n But with man:\n The lord doth not provide. Man must toil and in sorrow eat of the ground.\n So animals in general are provided for by god, man is not.\n The one's who really have it bad are some of the one's under man's control.\n Animals in factory farms live short, hellish lives by the hand of man.\n\n Animals do not have the promises of God, nor can they ever obtain them. Animals are here for man's sake, to have dominion over them. Man, on the other hand, is to have noble dominion over them and not mistreat them. Killing animals for food is not considered a form of mistreatment, but chaining a dog to a tree and letting it starve is detestable.\n \nI'm sorry, I have never come across this story before.\n This is classic.\n I love this story, I will share it!!\n I can see him telling his friends about it \n \"Today, God spoke through my XXX!\"\n \n But, seriously, this story is truly silly in every respect.\n Why did the angel with the sword get so angry with Balaam?\n Why did he expect him to go wherever the donkey went?\n If balaam didn't see the angel, why should the angel expect him to do what he wants? \n It's silly.\n It's like a children's story.\n The donkey spoke to him and he didn't freak out or anything,\n he just answered her.\n\n Or what the story really tells us is that God already knew that Balaam's faith was weak. In my observation of this episode, Balaam was no more than a soothsayer, not a prophet - even though the Bible said he was under the influence of the Spirit of God. If you read further Balaam went with a tribe of people that was not faithful to God and was later killed in battle.\n Other than showing that God can use anyone to promote His plan, that's about all I got out of the event.\n \nHigh comedy!\n\n You made it so...LOL! \n \nOh, and the donkey saw the angel all the time, but the Lord had to intervene, open Balaam's eyes to see the angel. \n Animals are closer to the Lord than humans.\n\n I can honestly say, yes, you're right about that...concerning some humans, but not all.\n \nThat's ok, just don't beat your donkey, she may only be doing what the lord asks her to do.\n \n Maybe that's what this passage is trying to tell you.\n\n A wee bit more of high comedy!? LOL! :)",

   "But isn't this what an instinct is? Something we do without a concrete reason, something everyone does? How can you say that this force isn't instinct?\n\n I am mainly referring to animalistic instinct, where reasoning is ruled out due to the composition of the brain. Moreover: Behavior that does not require \"learning\".\n \n I agree in that humans can respond via instinct - especially when dealing with emotions or physical pain, i.e., reactions to getting burned, finding someone in bed with your spouse, etc. But humans can learn how to deal with, and change, instinctual behavior with analysis and logic.",
