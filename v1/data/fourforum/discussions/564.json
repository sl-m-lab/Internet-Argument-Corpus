   "lets hear what you guys think, to see if I am the only paranoid one here. And I would like to hear Voice of Unreason's take on this, since he's the only anti-gunner even trying anymore. \n \n Ok, hears what I think. Gun control is the first step to a total ban on guns, which will lead to an unarmed, passive America so the government can rule us easier. The governments goal is to remove any possibilities that the people could protect themselves, from their tyrannical rule. And I see many laws coming out of this War that will help to further their goal. Hell, according to the governments \"what a terrorist is\", I am one. Even though I love this country and the people in it and would never harm them.\n \n I think people like Voice of Unreason really believe that they are trying to do good, by removing guns from the hands of criminals, but by doing that the only people that will have the guns is the criminals and the cops. Dont know about you but that makes me feel a little out numbered. But he doesnt see the big picture, the one where if our \"freedom to keep and bear arms\" is taken away, many other freedoms will follow. \n \n Thats what I think, and remember, Big Brother is Watching You.",

You should prepare for everything from a car accident, to a drunken college basketball riot, to a biblical drought, to an global killer asteriod, to an armed car-jacker. If you don't then your just sheep.\n \n I am not saying you build an a military cache of weapons and with 10 years of diesel fuel and MREs, but rather you do not do nothing other than rely on the government for help.",

   "What's the real reason behind gun-control? Read this excerpt from Sarah Brady's autobiography. She talks about the incident that made her a big enemy of the NRA-\n \n \n....On that summer day in 1985, Dorothy and the manager of the construction company were out doing errands, and they stopped by in their pickup truck with the idea that maybe Scott [Sarah's six year old son] and I would like to come out to the house and go swimming. We loved the idea, so we got our suits and went out to the truck. Scott got in first, and I climbed in behind him. He picked up off the seat what looked like a toy gun, and started waving it around, and I thought this was a perfect chance to talk to him about safety. So I took the gun from him, intending to say he must never point even a toy gun at anyone. As soon as I got it into my hand, I realized it was no toy. It was a fully loaded little Saturday-night special, very much like the one that had shot Jim. I cannot even begin to describe the rage that went through me. To think that my precious little boy, six years old, had actually held a loaded .22- that somebody, that manager, had left it there, out on the seat, pushed me right over the edge....The manager made some lame excuse about how he had to have that for self-protection against union members in St. Louis....I didn't even stop to think. I picked up the phone and called the National Rifle Association's Washington headquarters. I have no idea who answered; at that time in the evening, it may have well been a cleaning person. I didn't care. I just said, \"My name is Sarah Brady, and you've never heard of me, but I am going to make it my life's ambition to try to put you all out of business.\"\n The next day I went to work.\n (A Good Fight, by Sarah Brady, pages 91-94)\n",
