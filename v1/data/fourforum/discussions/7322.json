   "This is a rather long post but bear with it, as it will try to use logic to explain everything rather than refer to laws of science that you haven't had the chance to study, or refer to obscure quotes that truly need the context to get any unbiased significance. \n \n Religion is a way of explaining our surroundings and environment; it is human nature to want to know. This curiosity normally helps survival as with out knowing about the world we could not function (eg. how would you eat if you didn't know about shops?). Normally an incorrect belief of the world would cause you harm or death (eg. Thinking that you have to eat dirt as apposed to going to the shops), and so wrong theories don't hang about for very long (as any one that knows them is dead). This is not always the case however. Theories that don't directly effect survival, such as how we came to be, or why we are here, can't be eliminated in this way. As a result religion has relieved that part of human curiosity for a very long time, and beliefs that didn't were ether forgotten for better ones or, ironically enough, evolved and developed to become more satisfying.\n \n However, extraordinarily fast developments occurred in three crucial areas, communications, society, and science. The expansions in science triggered new discoveries faster than religion was able to compensated and changed to incorporate such things, and thus convincing less people. The change in society was such that it enabled people to speak with out prejudice about these new ideas that differed from the common belief, and new communications spread these ideas around the globe and enabled many people to collaborate to further develop them.\n \n This revolution was fast enough that people were able to see back at what they had believed: theories that were impossible in newly discovered science and that had no proof. And given the opportunity to learn from other people's mistakes, many people committed to only believe what was shown to be true, rather than try to explain every thing straight away.\n \n And essentially that is the difference between science and religion. Religion will try to explain everything by creating a hypothesis and working backwards to find supporting evidence and science will try to find evidence and work forwards to a hypothesis.\n \n Unfortunately the religious method of finding answers is fundamentally flawed. Its \"guess and check\" method doesn't work as essentially there are infinite different possible explanations available to check and so the chances of coming across the correct one are effectively zero.\n \n Before I go any further I just want to clarify a few things. There are limits to what the human mind can comprehend, and so even basic logic is not provable. The next best option that must be taken is that we accept as fundamentals the most basic things our mind can comprehend. If you don't understand what I mean by this then don't worry because this paragraph is intended for people that have very philosophical counter augments that often lead no were.\n \n If I was to ask a religious person of a provable way that he found out about his belief he would have to say that he was told. If the person that told him was asked the same thing he would have to say the same answer. Now of course it can go back wards like that for ever, it has to go back to three \"possible\" beginnings: some one lied, some one was insane/delusional/ect, or there was divine intervention/ect. The later of course can be eliminated as it does not fit the provable criteria of the question, and at the same time defies provable logic. An understandable counter argument is that science is the same, that everything I know I learnt in science class - I was told. And the person that told me that was told, and so forth. But that's were the difference lies. Let's take the example of gravity: I was told how it works by my science teacher, he was told by his, and so forth. But when we go all the way back down the line we would get to Newton, and upon asking him how he found out about gravity he would probably talk about how the apple fell on his head, and he thought about it, ran tests, and so forth - basically he discovered this fundamental idea of gravity. And from this discovery more people have made more, and developed it. So if you were to ask me how I know my theories on gravity I could go about it by showing you the same experiments and logic Newton and his successors used prove it from the fundamentals I mentioned earlier. Science works towards an answer from the fundamentals and religion does not.\n \n Another way of explaining this is by examining the creationist theory. One example of a creationist theory is that an omnipotent being created the world and placed all the animals including humans on it. A branch of this theory is that he created the world, then the sun, then animals, then the people, and then the rest in that order. A different branch is that he created people before the animals instead, or maybe he created the rest of the world before the people. Maybe the omnipotent being had purple skin, or yellow, or was a flying spaghetti with pink and orange poke-a-dots - There are unlimited possibilities, each as viable as the last. The fact that we're here doesn't prove one creation theory over another or intelligent design at all - but at the same time nothing disproves these theories. If there were only limited numbers of possible theories the \"you can't disprove it\" argument would be viable. But as you can't disprove the infinite other possible theories that angle of argument is out numbered infinite to one.\n \n Many believe that the amount of factors that would have needed to be just right for humans to evolve, make the chances of it happening dismissible. But one needs a better understanding of odds before making this argument. Let me give an example. Say that the chances of a coin landing and balancing on the edge are 3 billion to one. I then run a test were I make 3 billion people flip one coin each. Now let's say that the most likely out come occurred - one person's coin landed on the edge. If he could not see the rest of the experiment that person would assume that he is special. But in the grand scheme of things it is nothing special at least one person was likely to get a coin to land on its edge. It is the same with Earth; it is nothing special in the big picture considering the incomprehensible amount if possible solar systems.\n \n In reality science doesn't argue that intelligent design cannot be true, it simply argues that it is not true as far as it has researched and beyond that science doesn't try to blindly guess from the infinite possibilities. Or though science doesn't give the upfront answers to everything that religion does, it can offer some thing that blind faith cant - the limited answers that are given are more of less true. And in conclusion when one must make the choice between religion and science, they have a choice between knowing no truth, and knowing some.",

   "Don't get me wrong, but I think your piece shows a remarkably naive understanding of society, sociology, religion, and science. For example, you say:\n \n...as it will try to use logic to explain everything rather than refer to laws of science that you haven't had the chance to study, or refer to obscure quotes that truly need the context to get any unbiased significance.\nSince you are discussing philosophy, the laws of science aren't really relevant to any explanations anyway.\n \nReligion is a way of explaining our surroundings and environment; it is human nature to want to know.\nI can accept that thought, but I'm not clear on how our environment differs from our surroundings.\n \nThis curiosity normally helps survival as with out knowing about the world we could not function (eg. how would you eat if you didn't know about shops?).\nOh, I don't know. Grow food in a garden, gather it from various wild sources, hunt game animals in the forest.\n \nNormally an incorrect belief of the world would cause you harm or death (eg. Thinking that you have to eat dirt as apposed to going to the shops), and so wrong theories don't hang about for very long (as any one that knows them is dead).\nBut you are using the word theory incorrectly. Since part of your discussion purports to be about science, one might make the mistake that you are using the word \"theory\" with a scientific connotation. You are not. What you are talking about is folk mythology, not theory.\n \nThis is not always the case however. Theories that don't directly effect survival, such as how we came to be, or why we are here, can't be eliminated in this way. As a result religion has relieved that part of human curiosity for a very long time, and beliefs that didn't were ether forgotten for better ones or, ironically enough, evolved and developed to become more satisfying.\nAgain, you are talking about mythology, whether religious mythology or folk mythology. Primitive people attributed lightning to supernatural beings because they had no understanding of how such events could be natural. Thus, events that weren't understood and couldn't be controlled became the deeds of gods acting on whims or because sufficient sacrifices had not been performed.\n \nHowever, extraordinarily fast developments occurred in three crucial areas, communications, society, and science.\nThankfully.\n \nThe expansions in science triggered new discoveries faster than religion was able to compensated and changed to incorporate such things, and thus convincing less people. The change in society was such that it enabled people to speak with out prejudice about these new ideas that differed from the common belief, and new communications spread these ideas around the globe and enabled many people to collaborate to further develop them.\nThere is some truth in that. Most people of faith don't have a problem with science. However, certain cultist views do cling to mythology as revealed, unchangeable truth.\n \nThis revolution was fast enough that people were able to see back at what they had believed: theories that were impossible in newly discovered science and that had no proof.\nBzzzzzt. I'm sorry. Wrong answer. Science doesn't prove. Science explains - like this. First an observation of some natural phenomenon that the observer doesn't understand. The observer proposes an explanation for the phenomenon based on previously known science (laws and theories), experience, and intuition (guesswork). This proposed explanation is called an hypothesis. The next step is to test the hypothesis. This is done by first making a prediction of some unobserved condition or phenomenon that must necessarily be true if, and only if, the hypothesis is correct. The final step is to devise an experiment to test the prediction by making the observed prediction. If the test has been stringent enough, the hypothesis may be called a theory. If the hypothesis fails the test, then the hypothesis is adjusted (with the added data from the test) or the hypothesis is rejected and a new one proposed.\n \n Of course, science is a human endeavor so that \"the scientific method\" is just a guide to how individuals proceed in doing science. However, science is always tentative, at least logically, and science is predictive.\n \nAnd given the opportunity to learn from other people's mistakes, many people committed to only believe what was shown to be true, rather than try to explain every thing straight away.\nAnd many people, because the pursuit of science can be difficult, instead decided to declare their mythology as the truth and to view everything else, including science, in that light.\n \nAnd essentially that is the difference between science and religion. Religion will try to explain everything by creating a hypothesis and working backwards to find supporting evidence and science will try to find evidence and work forwards to a hypothesis.\nYou are confused. You are mixing \"creation science\" with religion. They are not the same. When religion is represented as scientific, the starting point is the desired conclusion. It isn't an hypothesis but is declared as the absolute, unalterable truth. Then evidence is selectively chosen (and twisted) that will support that conclusion. Evidence that does not fit is rejected as the work of evil.\n \nUnfortunately the religious method of finding answers is fundamentally flawed.\nAt least we agree on that.\n \nIts \"guess and check\" method doesn't work as essentially there are infinite different possible explanations available to check and so the chances of coming across the correct one are effectively zero.\nBut that's not even how \"creation science\", or any religiously motivated science works. There is no checking involved - what I mean by that is that answers are always ad hoc. It doesn't matter if there is a better explanation available that does not involve mythology and superstition, if observations can be made to fit the religious scenario, it is evidence. Again, there is no checking of facts, i.e., no testing, and of course, no predictions.\n \nBefore I go any further I just want to clarify a few things. There are limits to what the human mind can comprehend, and so even basic logic is not provable. The next best option that must be taken is that we accept as fundamentals the most basic things our mind can comprehend. If you don't understand what I mean by this then don't worry because this paragraph is intended for people that have very philosophical counter augments that often lead no were.\nThen I guess my counter arguments are philosophical and lead no where, because I have no idea of what point your were trying to make. From what I remember from my course in logic, it does not involve accepting fundamentals because our minds cannot comprehend. One salient characteristic of science is that it tests everything.\n \nIf I was to ask a religious person of a provable way that he found out about his belief he would have to say that he was told. If the person that told him was asked the same thing he would have to say the same answer. Now of course it can go back wards like that for ever, it has to go back to three \"possible\" beginnings: some one lied, some one was insane/delusional/ect, or there was divine intervention/ect.\nActually, the answer might depend more on the nature of the question, or the particular religious cult of the person being asked, etc. In questions of science, fundamentalists will tell you that the answer was revealed to them by their god in their holy scripture.\n \n On the other hand, you are characterizing religion as insanity. I think that you really mean that when religion is offered as science, then that is insane.\n \nThe later of course can be eliminated as it does not fit the provable criteria of the question, and at the same time defies provable logic.\nBut the latter is exactly what some (especially in the U.S.) propose as science and truth.\n \nAn understandable counter argument is that science is the same, that everything I know I learnt in science class - I was told. And the person that told me that was told, and so forth. But that's were the difference lies. Let's take the example of gravity: I was told how it works by my science teacher, he was told by his, and so forth. But when we go all the way back down the line we would get to Newton, and upon asking him how he found out about gravity he would probably talk about how the apple fell on his head, and he thought about it, ran tests, and so forth - basically he discovered this fundamental idea of gravity. And from this discovery more people have made more, and developed it. So if you were to ask me how I know my theories on gravity I could go about it by showing you the same experiments and logic Newton and his successors used prove it from the fundamentals I mentioned earlier. Science works towards an answer from the fundamentals and religion does not.\nExcept that Newton didn't prove anything about gravity. Newton formulated equations that expressed the strength of gravity, applied that to falling bodies and orbiting planets, and it all worked. We still use Newtonian physics in launching space missions. But Newton didn't explain what gravity is or how it works.\n \nAnother way of explaining this is by examining the creationist theory. One example of a creationist theory is that an omnipotent being created the world and placed all the animals including humans on it. A branch of this theory is that he created the world, then the sun, then animals, then the people, and then the rest in that order. A different branch is that he created people before the animals instead, or maybe he created the rest of the world before the people. Maybe the omnipotent being had purple skin, or yellow, or was a flying spaghetti with pink and orange poke-a-dots - There are unlimited possibilities, each as viable as the last. The fact that we're here doesn't prove one creation theory over another or intelligent design at all - but at the same time nothing disproves these theories. If there were only limited numbers of possible theories the \"you can't disprove it\" argument would be viable. But as you can't disprove the infinite other possible theories that angle of argument is out numbered infinite to one.\nExcept that not one thing that you have stated above is a theory. There is no such thing as a \"creationist theory.\" Theories are tested explanations for evidence. As I explained before, \"creation science\" begins from the revealed, unchanging truth and then selectively interprets the observed data to fit. \"Creation science\" in neither predictive nor is it logically tested - science is both.\n \nMany believe that the amount of factors that would have needed to be just right for humans to evolve, make the chances of it happening dismissible. But one needs a better understanding of odds before making this argument. Let me give an example. Say that the chances of a coin landing and balancing on the edge are 3 billion to one. I then run a test were I make 3 billion people flip one coin each. Now let's say that the most likely out come occurred - one person's coin landed on the edge. If he could not see the rest of the experiment that person would assume that he is special. But in the grand scheme of things it is nothing special at least one person was likely to get a coin to land on its edge. It is the same with Earth; it is nothing special in the big picture considering the incomprehensible amount if possible solar systems.\nActually, after the fact calculations on either side are just noise. Humans do exist and I suspect that all statements of probabilities are incorrect. Further, I don't think that coin flips are relevant and not even a very good analogy.\n \nIn reality science doesn't argue that intelligent design cannot be true, it simply argues that it is not true as far as it has researched and beyond that science doesn't try to blindly guess from the infinite possibilities.\nWell, the first part is true but I'm not sure I understand what you are saying in the second part. Science does not claim that intelligent design is false because science lacks the tools to examine the concept. ID is just another unsupported assertion outside the domain of science (and logic for that matter). ID has reached the stage of unsupported assertion without evidence. Science has better explanations.\n \nOr though science doesn't give the upfront answers to everything that religion does, it can offer some thing that blind faith cant - the limited answers that are given are more of less true. And in conclusion when one must make the choice between religion and science, they have a choice between knowing no truth, and knowing some.\nBut, as Stephen Jay Gould said, religion and science are independent, non-overlaping magisteria. But I think you are again confusing religion with \"creation science.\" While \"creation science\" may be the view of science of one religious cult, it is not characteristic of all religion.\n \n And of course, I agree that science does not give \"upfront answers\" whereas religion does. Of course, science begins with the questions and \"creation science\" begins with the answers.",

TO employs this strategy to give its visitors a sense of universal appeal, i.e. that anyone, regardless of their beliefs, may subscribe to evolution. But again, exactly what evolution are they referring to? The one that says \"things change\" (this is science), or the one that says \"that's how everything came to be\" (this transcends science and is philosophical naturalism-a metaphysical position)?

In fact, it would be downright dishonest for us to do so.\n\n \n Now here is another page from talkorigins, as one of them describes his visit to the ICR museum;\n \n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/icr-visit/linke.html\n \n He basically describes what he saw, with the following color commentary;\n \n \n\"There were about 20 spaces in the parking lot.\" \n \n \"(By the way, the curator of the museum was listening to Rush Limbaugh at the front desk)\"\n \n \"I listened to a mother describe to her daughter how the oceans dried up....\"\n \n \"One of the museum patrons commented.....\"\n \n \"One woman walking by commented.....\"\n \n \"His friend replied.....\"\n \n \"Another person said......\"\n\n \n What did any of these things have to do with a neutral description of a museum visit?

The plaque next to it read: \"Rosetta stone from near Rashid (Rosetta), Delta Egypt; 196 B.C....This inscribed stone slab was discovered in 1799 by...\" Nowhere did the plaque indicate that this wasn't the ACTUAL stone. In fact, from the language it seemed that I was standing before the real thing. The museum had become quite busy, and as I wrote the above quote some people walked by and marveled that the ICR museum had this artifact. I was amused, but broke their hearts when I tapped on the hollow cardboard \"stone\" and indicated that it was just a photograph. \n\n \n If the museum wanted people to think it was a real stone, wouldn't they put it behind some glass to keep wise ones like him from \"tapping\" on it?

The focus of this site is biological evolution. Not atheism. Not the big bang. Not whether God does or does not exist. Biological evolution, which is the theory that all modern life forms are derived from a common ancestor through descent with modification. That theory doesn't say anything about the beginning of the universe, or even the beginning of the earth, it only deals with the natural history of life on Earth. The theory of evolution does not conclude with \"and therefore there is no God\". Your dispute is with atheism, not with evolution.\n\n \n He seems to be doing something that a lot of people do, which is to separate the common ancestor theory with atheism. What religion states that the supernatural created ONE life form on earth, then left, and let it all evolve natrually? None that I know of. What religion (worldview) implies that natural processes caused the first life form to appear on earth, then it all evolved naturally? Atheism, and, his philosophical naturalism.",

   "And essentially that is the difference between science and religion. Religion will try to explain everything by creating a hypothesis and working backwards to find supporting evidence and science will try to find evidence and work forwards to a hypothesis.\n\n \n \nYou are confused. You are mixing \"creation science\" with religion. They are not the same. When religion is represented as scientific, the starting point is the desired conclusion. It isn't an hypothesis but is declared as the absolute, unalterable truth. Then evidence is selectively chosen (and twisted) that will support that conclusion. Evidence that does not fit is rejected as the work of evil.\n\n \n I think you are splitting some semantic hairs with this response, and THE_oldy's point is quite correct in its general meaning. \n \n Science says\n \n evidence-< analysis -< conclusion\n \n while religion says\n \n conclusion-< evidence-< analysis\n \n This is applicable to religion as a whole, and not just creation science. Beyond the material assembled in the Bible there has been no new \"offiical\" biblical material added since and so the same conclusions are applied ad nauseum throughtout history. Admittedly, every so often a group comes along who interprets a new \"conclusion\" but there is never really a change to the basic attitude with which religion treats the rest of the human experience. It comes first and has all the answers, everything else is secondary to its truth.\n \n Anyway, nice post THE_oldy, I very much agree with your line of reasoning. I'd like to ask what you think about the effect of religion as a mechanism for cultural unity- this must be the other important causative influence along side the need to be able to explain the \"why\" in a time long before an empirical understanding of the world was established.",

The way that you expressed it, one might think that you meant that philosophical naturalism was the same as materialism, and that methodological naturalism was the same as atheism. While philosophical naturalism may be atheistic, and while it may even be materialistic, methodological naturalism isn't. Methodological naturalism isn't a philosophy but, as the name indicates, a method of investigating nature. It is science. So unless creationists wish to deny that their god is supernatural, he/she/it is not a proper subject of study of methodological naturalism. Science neither affirms nor denies the supernatural nor the god of the creationists. Science doesn't examine that question - there are limits to what questions science can answer. Science doesn't deny any god since there has been no evidence of any god presented the can be quantified.\n \n Science is atheistic in the same way that plumbing is atheistic.
