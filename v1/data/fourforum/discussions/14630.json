   "Does Merkel loco? May be German will be the asylum for former terrorists and some one else! If you don't know that Merkel agree to receive former Guantanamo prisoners! Obama fulfills his election promises but prisoners who suspected in terrorism he is trying to push aside in the world! I wonder why this reptile didn't settled those suspected persons at home after their close collaboration with US specialists? Is Germany looking like a convalescent center for Guantanamo prisoners?\n XXXX, we need to kick away all of them, we don't need problems. Well, do Merkel stupid? She must understand that Americans had never arrested someone just for the hell of it! If some one felt into Guantanamo - guilty! If no one could prove one's belonging that was double-dyed, that's why CIA specialists cant broken one's mind! And those gifts were delivered to Germany!",
