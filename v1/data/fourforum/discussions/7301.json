That would have at least made some sense. Why can't he just let the Gay people take their flag to Hell with them? Wouldn't the flag get burned too?\n \n I suppose Mr. Lewis has the right to express himself as much as any other American. I just hope that I never have to meet him in person.

Evangelical would suggest, since they are trying to go out and make Christians in the name of God, shouldn't they be presenting a message of Love. Why are they always sending a message of hate?\n \n Here's what I say:\n #### On Hate!\n \n Okay, this won't let me say that so replace that with Pee On Hate!",
