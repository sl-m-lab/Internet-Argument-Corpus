   "Something of interest to listen to here from the BBC Radio 4 series In Our Time hosted by Melvyn Bragg.\n \n This 45 minute programme examines the current understanding of the origin of life and the enivronment in which life arose. Also considered is when natural selection began, major steps on the road to complex life such as the origins of the eurkaryote and how early life replicated itself.\n \n Amongst the guests this week is Professor Richard Dawkins of Oxford University, who we all respect or despise depending on our outlooks.\n \n This is the link:\n \n http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/inourtime.shtml\n \n Click the \"listen again\" tab to begin. Requires RealPlayer plugin (the free one). If you are running a firewall, you will need to ensure RealPlayer is authorised to access the internet.\n \n Enjoy! emoticon_cool",

   "I don't agree with the very first assertion in the audio clip, that all life is derived from a SINGLE ancestor. We don't know that.\n\n But it isn't an assertion of absolute truth. It is actually an assertion of the consensus of current scientific thought. I have read some discussion about various other possibilities. Maybe several forms of life arose in various environments. Eventually they then had to compete for resourses and all but one went extinct. And then there is the hypothesis that life arose more than once and fused into a single population. The bottom line is that the DNA code is universal with only a few minor differences in a limited number of primative organisms.\n \nReading the essay I linked to would shed some light onto why this may be a flawed idea.\n\n That isn't apparent from the abstract. And I'm not in a position to \"purchase\" the full article.\n \nIt may be true, but we don't know it and this guy says that everyone agrees that it is so.\n\n Right. We don't know. But it does appear from the universality of the genetic code that all life had a common ancestor. Of course, since you understand evolutionary theory, you are aware that the common ancestor is a population of reproducing organisms.\n \nWe can't say for sure that there was a first discrete organism all by its lonesome. There may have been a range of organized reactions that spawned others.\n\n Exactly. What are you debating? Are you arguing that several identical genetic codes arose more than once?\n \nEven if there were a first event of compartmentalisation of some type of metabolism and/or \"genes\" but that may not have been the only one and it may not have been the ancestor of all life.\n\n I'm not sure of your point. So the first \"event of compartmentalisiation\" went extinct because of excessive ultraviolet exposure or the like. No one is claiming that the first reproducing molecule is the origin of all life. What is claimed is that all life is descended from a single ancestor.",

It's possible that a number of very\n ancient events occurred that aborted or destroyed molecules that\n may have had the potential to originate biological activity had they\n been, so to speak, left to chance and their own devices to develop\n in a favourable environment.",

This issue is explored in more detail when Dawkins talks about a population of self replicating molecules (27:00) and how the first life, as we define it would have arisen when there was concentration of these molecules and then the first cells- there is no suggestion of a single entity that was responsible for all subsequent life.\n \n Thanks for the links on the articles btw.",

   "Just to repeat what I think others are saying, when we talk about the \"single common ancestor\" of all life, we are not speaking of an individual, but a population of organisms belonging to a single species.\n \n Nor is this to say that there weren't other species existing at this time -- just one of them left descendents that are still extant.\n \n And some current theories suggest that there may not have been a single ancestral species, at least not in terms of our genetic heritage. I believe that there is some belief that \"lateral gene transfer\" was a huge component of evolution way back when, mixing up the lineages quite well.",
