My wife and I have always been very active in our kids' schooling and it has paid dividends. My oldest just graduated college \"with high honors\" and is getting ready to start grad school, my son graduated HS as the salutatorium has a full-ride scholastic scholarship to an excellent engineering school. #2 daughter is #1 in her HS class going into her senior year. \n For my oldest, we didn't like the way our local HS' curriculum, so we sent her to a private Catholic HS for her freshman year. After talking to the local HS principal prior to her sophomore year, he assured us that they were getting their act together and we let her attend public HS for her remaining 3 years. My son and daughter #2 had gone to a gifted program from age 8 on, so they were well on their way to success already. While we were fortunate that the program existed, it took some effort on our part to make it happen. Lots of hoops and not much help from outside. The school was located in another nearby town and we had to provide transportation, for example. With my wife being a stay-at-home Mom, she was able to be the taxi cab for many years. \n (That was another conscious choice that we made in our kids' best interests.)\n So, I'd say that it was a combination of being an active advocate for my kids , being able to take advantage of special programs being offerred and the \"good genes\" that they inheritted from my wife. ;) \n One way to get more of these programs into public school is to go to school board meetings and tell them that they're needed and if they aren't created, you'll put your kids in private school. Public school officials don't like to hear that.",

I'm way too busy making my own life a success to hang out on a street corner protesting. I wish I had that kinda free time.\" = socialist\n \n Driving by and thinking \"You good for nothing losers. BOOO!
