   "A while ago, me and Archie got into an argument about the various mistranslations of the bible, and the ramifications thereof. The discussion between me and Archie ended with Archie asking me to prove that all of the instances of the word 'unnatural' with respect to homosexuality be shown to be mistranslations/opinions/outdated morals/laws, although he didn't provide me with a list. As such, I'll just address the ones that I can find (thanks, wikipedia....\n \n Genesis: Outdated morals of the OT. Rationale: God chooses to save Lot - a man who offered his daughters to a rape mob - and Lot's daughters, who drug Lot and have sex with him while he sleeps. Lot's daughters then mother two great nations - some reward for date-raping their father.\n \n Leviticus: Outdated morals of the OT. Rationale: 'Anyone who dishonours their father and mother must be put to death' is in the same part.\n \n Romans: This is possibly a mistranslation, but more likely (going by my readings of the NIV) outdated opinion and lack of context. Rationale: the passage reads \" 24Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. 25They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator-who is forever praised. Amen.\n \n 26Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. 27In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.\n \n 28Furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done. 29They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips, 30slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; 31they are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless. 32Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.\n 24-26 (inclusive) do not deal with homosexuality but with promiscuity (possibly), and are the only items that deal with 'what God did'. \n 27, the only verse that does deal with homosexuality, starts 'in the same way' as opposed to the 'god gave them over' which characterises the other verses. Here 'natural' and 'decent' are used, but it is unknown in what sense they are used - be it God's opinion, or Paul's.\n The rest of the quote refers to the outdated system set up in Leviticus, further antiquating the latter.\n Finally, this letter was not written by God/Jesus but by a human with his own (inherrantly corrupt) worldview. This does not form a good way by which to get God's morals.\n \n Timothy: Bad context. Rationale: This doesn't mention homosexuals, but 'whoremongers, them that defile themselves with mankind and menstealers'. I can think of plenty of ways by which individuals can 'defile themselves with mankind' that is neither sodomy-related nor homosexual in nature.\n \n Corinthians: See 'Timothy'\n \n Jude: The condemnation is not homosexuality, but 'lusting after strange flesh'. From Genesis - the people of Sodom wanted to rape angels, who would probably count as 'strange sex', being (as far as I am aware) genderless.\n \n Note also that Romans is the only one which mentions female homosexuality. By everything else, lesbians are fine.\n \n Any more, or any comments? I wrote these as I came up with them, so I suspect there may be the odd hole here and there...",

   "Post valid theological sources that don't distort or pervert the bible and you'll have no problem with me at all debating issues. What iangb posted is a bad joke as theological sources go. Here's an example of a valid theological source that deals with homosexuality honestly and objectively. http://www.bible.com/bibleanswers_result.php?id=246 Here's an excerpt from it:\n WHAT DOES THE BIBLE SAY ABOUT... HOMOSEXUALITY?\n \n We realize that this subject can be a very difficult one to address. Furthermore, as hate crimes specifically committed against homosexuals occur, many feel that this issue shouldn't be addressed at all for fear of only adding to the hostile environment that many homosexuals face. Despite the cultural climate in which we live, this issue must be addressed according to the Word of God. God's laws are always for our good, although man may see them as restricting. In the end, only obedience to the Word of God can bring true freedom. We address this issue out of God's love for the homosexual to bless and help him.\n \n Much of our society has embraced many perverted sexual practices that are considered in the Bible as abominations to God. Homosexuality is among the list of deviate or abnormal sexual practices however, there are many other practices that can be included as well. Pornography, pedophilia, prostitution, bestiality, oral sex, phone sex and computer virtual reality sex, just to name a few of them.\n \n 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 (NIV): \"Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters, nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.\"\n \n Although the Bible doesn't detail each and every one of these sinful acts, it does clearly speak out about many of them. Any deviation from God's original plan for sex between a married man and woman is still a sin in God's eyes. The main reason we call these things perverted is because they are unnatural and scripture clearly tells us those who do such things are committing abominations. Leviticus 18:22 (KJV): \"Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind it is abomination.\"\n \n Homosexuality is also referred to as the sin of sodomy. This reference comes from an account in the Bible of two exceedingly wicked cities, Sodom and Gomorrah, which the Lord destroyed. Sodom was known for its rampant homosexuality and unrestrained sexual lust, as well as other sins such as arrogance, haughtiness, and disregard for the poor. When the Lord sent angels to warn Lot who lived in the city that it was about to be destroyed, the men of the city actually wanted to rape the angels! Genesis 13:13: \"But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly.\"\n \n In the Old Testament the penalty for this sin was severe. Leviticus 20:13: \"If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.\" Today the penalty of death comes in the form of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. It also brings death to the soul and spirit of man because the life of God is pushed out by indulging in something that is an abomination to God. God wants to deliver all who are trapped in this unholy practice and He will if anyone calls out to Him with a sincere heart.\n \n We certainly acknowledge that AIDS has broken out of the homosexual community, and now, many innocent people are suffering with this disease through no fault of their own. However, the intent of the above statement is not directed to those who have innocently contracted this disease, but rather to the sinners who are spreading it. A comparison could be made to those who smoke. Smokers are opening themselves up for lung cancer; however, the people who are subjected to breathing the smoke second-hand are also subject to this disease. The person who willfully smokes is guilty of destroying their own bodies, but should those who are forced to live in the environment of the smoke, get lung cancer, they are not guilty of this sin. When we teach that smoking causes lung cancer, we are not judging or condemning those who innocently get lung cancer from breathing second-hand smoke. It is simply a true fact that smoking can cause lung cancer.\n The same is true of AIDS. A homosexual life style increases the risk of that person contracting AIDS. There is no condemnation or judgment against those who innocently contract this disease through no fault of their own (for instance, through blood transfusions.) However, since AIDS is most prevalent in the homosexual community, we need to warn people of the dangers of homosexuality, so that AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases are not spread to the rest of society, as now, many heterosexuals have contracted these diseases too, through unfaithful partners.\n Romans 1:24-32:\n \n 24 Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:\n 25 Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.\n 26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:\n 27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet.\n 28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;\n 29 Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,\n 30 Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,\n 31 Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:\n 32 Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.\n \n These scriptures clearly state that these vile affections of men lusting for other men (gay men) or women lusting for other women (lesbians) are not the natural affections God created men and women to have for one another. Let me say here that God loves all homosexuals! However, He hates the deeds of homosexuality because they are sinful. God did not create any human being as a homosexual. They are not born that way, just as murderers are not born that way. However, these spirits can be transmitted to children, especially if someone who had this demonic spirit seduced or raped a child--or even if they were close to gay people. These demons can also be imparted to others through unholy sexual acts.\n \n People become homosexuals because they yield to abnormal acts or lust. It is through some source that they have received a demonic spirit that drives them to their lust. Viewing evil videos or pornographic books is a way of opening the door for Satan to give one an evil, perverse spirit. Though people are not born as homosexuals, the Bible does say all human beings are born with a sin nature. If we yield to the evils of our flesh it will lead to our destruction not only in this life, but in the life to come. However, through faith in Jesus Christ and His death on the cross we can break the hold that sin has upon us. We do not have to yield to the old fleshy nature but we can now overcome evil temptations and live our lives controlled by the Holy Spirit.",

Later, Lot knocks up both daughters, but God once again does not destroy Lot (or the daughters. (In Archie land, this is also apparently not sexual immorality.)\n I seem to recall that Archie has told us that he has daughters.

   "You're joking right?\n\n Nope, not at all. I think you've misunderstood what I've actually written. My OP was entirely written by me, from my own interpretation of several segments of the bible. Which particular segments to use were given to me by Wikipedia, but that was all I used the article for - the only part of the article I used was the bit I quoted in my previous post. The only other source I used in the entire post-writing was biblegateway, to look at the verses which wikipedia pointed me to.\n \n To reiterate: All I got from Wikipedia was 'these verses from the bible are relevant to homosexuality'. Nothing more. My analysis of those verses is biased, but it's kind of hard to personally interpret something without adding your personal bias to the interpretation, as Archangel regularly shows.\n \n \nIt certainly is. Its called gross miscomprehension. \n\n In which case, I suggest you look at the OP and explain to me why my interpretation of the relevant verses count as 'gross miscomprehension'. Until then, you are following the same path as Archie by stating that the Bible says X without even addressing my argument to the contrary.\n \n The OT condemns homosexuality. Jesus breaks the moral system set up in the OT. The NT never contains condemnation from God, merely the opinions of a man who has been shown to base his other opinions on OT moral values. Until you can show me otherwise, merely saying that you can proves nothing.\n \n \nThis should be grounds enough to realise that the bible shouldn't be taken seriously on any level. You won't achieve this by pretend there's something in the bible that isn't there. What's in the bible is in the bible, but nobody needs to take it literally. This is the point I made in the first place.\nAh, the perils of agnosticism. You take the flak from both sides.\n \n I am as yet uncertain as to what level the Bible can be taken 'seriously'. Certainly anyone who follows the broken OT values is taking the Bible too literally, but I have yet to find something that breaks the bible 'on every level' (with the possible exception of Elisha and the Bears, but I can probably work around it if no-one else gives me a decent answer). The Bible is merely broken when verses are taken out of context of the whole - for example, 'an eye for an eye' without 'turn the other cheek'. For the record, however (not sure why I'm putting this here, but meh...), I am an agnostic atheist. I'm just seeking to clarify my understanding of the whole.\n \n \nI do care about the topic. You're going about the wrong way trying to convince archie or anybody that what's in the bible is not in the bible. If you want to keep trying that, good luck. Convincing him that despite what the bible says, we have valid reasons to disregard it, imo, will get you better results.\nTo be honest, I completely disagree. Archangel has his Scripture, and will live his life by it, regardless of the apparent conflicts with reality his interpretation may cause. Given this, the main way to change his mind on any subject must be to use the same Scripture that he does.\n \n It's the same reason that the threat of Hell makes no difference to an atheist who doesn't believe in Hell in the first place.\n \n My thanks for the luck :) .",

I marvel that tq can reinterpret it so easily to fit his personal preferences and that iangb and lyte will congratulate him as if he has actually accomplished anything more than deluding himself. This is the first post worth responding to on this thread and I just wanted to thank you for that.\n \n I would also like to say that the OT dietary laws and the cotton/wool blend laws in clothing that are no longer followed weren't moral issues but were legal issues. Comparing them to laws applying to sexual sins such as adultery, fornication, idolatry, pedophilia or homosexuality are completely different issues and are likened to comparing jay walking with murder, as law breakers would go. If the NT spoke to homosexuality as no longer being a moral issue, I would be defending it as right and good for all people who were inclined to go that way. But the NT is as clear as the old testament is, except that it doesn't call for the death of homosexuals, it accepts that all men are sinners and equal in our need for salvation in this Age of Grace. It makes clear that no sin is worse than any other in Gods sight. God loves gays as much as any other type of sinner.",

   "No, no I don't. I don't see it as a moral issue at all. I don't see it as a ceremonial issue, either. I don't see it as an anything issue: I don't think there's a damn thing wrong with working on Sunday, because it's just another day. I do it a lot. And nobody calls for me to be stoned for it.\n \n You said that the violations that earn the death penalty are the moral ones:\n God tells Moses that a man who was picking up sticks on the sabbath should be put to death (Numbers 15).\n Thus, picking up sticks on the sabbath, a.k.a. sabbath-breaking, is a violation of God's serious moral law.\n \n But you don't regard sabbath-breaking as detestable or abominable, and neither does the vast majority of Christianity. That is, you are picking and choosing. QED.\n\n \n I realize you wont appreciate this explanation, but here it is anyway in context of the event and the chapter it's found in. \n  22-29) Addressing unintentional sin, both as a nation and individuals.\n \n If you sin unintentionally, and do not observe all these commandments which the LORD has spoken to Moses; all that the LORD has commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day the LORD gave commandment and onward throughout your generations; then it will be, if it is unintentionally committed, without the knowledge of the congregation, that the whole congregation shall offer one young bull as a burnt offering, as a sweet aroma to the LORD, with its grain offering and its drink offering, according to the ordinance, and one kid of the goats as a sin offering. So the priest shall make atonement for the whole congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them, for it was unintentional; they shall bring their offering, an offering made by fire to the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their unintended sin. It shall be forgiven the whole congregation of the children of Israel and the stranger who dwells among them, because all the people did it unintentionally. And if a person sins unintentionally, then he shall bring a female goat in its first year as a sin offering. So the priest shall make atonement for the person who sins unintentionally, when he sins unintentionally before the LORD, to make atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him. You shall have one law for him who sins unintentionally, for him who is native-born among the children of Israel and for the stranger who dwells among them.\n \n a. If you sin unintentionally: Significantly, the Bible talks about sins unintentionally committed. Many today think and live as if an action is unintentional, it cannot be sin. But many of the worst sins are committed with the best of intentions. Intentions matter nothing when the result is sin.\n \n i. Especially in the 20th century, all sorts of horrific atrocities and terror have been committed by those dedicated to honorable causes; Communism sought to establish a just, fair economy where each worked according to his ability and received according to his need - and became the instrument of the genocide of tens of millions of people.\n \n ii. Today, in the church, many a gossip, many a talebearer, many a divisive person will claim the best of intentions. Even if we agree they have the right intentions, they still may be in grievous sin. The same applies for a myriad of other sins we are often ready to ignore or think lightly of, all on the basis of \"after all, they had good intentions.\"\n \n b. That the whole congregation shall offer one young bull as a burnt offering: Unintentional sins needed a blood atonement; a bull had to be sacrificed with the nation as a whole was guilty, and a female goat had to be sacrificed when an individual was guilty.\n \n c. You shall have one law for him who sins unintentionally: There was to be no exception. Sin is sin, and must be accounted as such, even if the motive seemed good.\n \n 2. (30-31) Addressing presumptuous sin.\n \n But the person who does anything presumptuously, whether he is native-born or a stranger, that one brings reproach on the LORD, and he shall be cut off from among his people. Because he has despised the word of the LORD, and has broken His commandment, that person shall be completely cut off; his guilt shall be upon him.\n \n a. But the person who does anything presumptuously: Literally, to sin presumptuously means to sin \"with a high hand.\" It speaks of a flagrant rebellion against God, the law of Moses, and the nation as a whole.\n \n b. That person shall be completely cut off; his guilt shall be upon him: Such sin was not to be tolerated in Israel. This command was a cultural mechanism for addressing this sin, and ensuring that such arrogant flaunting of public morality would not be rewarded.\n \n i. This is in stark contrast to modern culture where notorious, flagrant sinners are rewarded with fame and fortune. Instead of his guilt shall be upon him, our society puts guilt on anyone who would judge or condemn such depraved individuals by calling what they do evil.\n \n (verses 32-36) Execution of a Sabbath violator.\n \n Now while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day. And those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation. They put him under guard, because it had not been explained what should be done to him. Then the LORD said to Moses, \"The man must surely be put to death; all the congregation shall stone him with stones outside the camp.\" So, as the LORD commanded Moses, all the congregation brought him outside the camp and stoned him with stones, and he died.\n \n a. They found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day: This was an immediate example of dealing with someone who sinned presumptuously. All of Israel knew the Sabbath law, and this man no doubt thought him self a courageous social reformer, trying by his example to free the nation from the shackles of heaven's law.\n \n i. \"It seems likely that the following story of the sabbath breaker illustrates what sinning with a high hand means.\" (Wenham)\n \n b. The man must surely be put to death: Instead, God commanded the execution of this presumptuous sinner, that all might fear. This was so all would know that the social order and law of God are more important than any individual's \"right\" to attack or destroy that social order or law of God.\n http://www.enduringword.com/commentaries/0415.htm",

The only places where this exists (that I can see) are Leviticus, which is rendered irrelevant by Jesus, and Romans, which states the opinion of Paul and not of God.\n \n \nJesus referred to taking things personally. \n\n Jesus, essentially, said \"God previously said that you should take an eye for an eye.

   "We choose to commit sin, but I don't believe that two people who love each other are committing sin by being together, any more than a husband and wife having sex do. \n\n \n Well, God says different. And I Corinthians 13 says that love does not rejoice in iniquity.\n \n \n\"Judge not lest thou shall be judged\" - did I get that one right enough for you?\n\n \n That's just a tired old liberal ploy designed to try to shut up anyone from saying anything at all is wrong.\n \n \"Judge not, and you will not be judged.\" (Matthew 7:1)\n \n Jesus is not saying that we cannot make judgments about people or behaviors, he is saying that we should not be hypocrites if we do. In Matthew 7:5 he says, \"You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck that is in your brothers eye.\"\n \n God acknowledges the legitimacy of civil authorities to judge:  \n \n Romans 13:1-4: \"Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. (v. 4) For he (the reigning authority) is God's servant to do you good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword for nothing. He is God's servant, an agent of God's wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.\" (Also note Matthew 5:25; Acts 25:10-11)\n \n God has commanded the church to make correct judgments:\n \n John 7:24: \"Stop judging by mere appearances, and make a right judgment.\"\n \n Matthew 18:15-17: \"If your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over. But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses (note Deuteronomy 19:15). If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector .\"\n \n I Corinthians 5:13: \"Are you not to judge those inside (the church)? God will judge those outside. Expel the wicked man from among you.\"\n \n I Corinthians 6:4: \"Therefore, if you have disputes about such matters, appoint as judges even men of little account in the church.\"\n \n God commands us to judge according to one's 'fruits.'\n \n Matthew 7:17-20: \"Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.....every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them.\"\n \n Saints of Christ will judge the world, and angels:\n \n I Corinthians 6:2: \"Do you not know that the saints will judge the world?\"\n \n I Corinthians 6:3: \"Do you not know that we will judge angels?\"\n \n Jesus condemned the teachers of the law and the Pharisees:\n \n Matthew 23:27-28: \"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean. In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.\"\n \n John the Baptist rebukes King Herod for adultery and other sins:\n \n Luke 3:19: \"But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of Herodias, his brother's wife, and all the other things he had done, Herod added this to them all: He locked John up in prison.\" \n \n Stephen rebukes the Jewish leaders:\n \n Acts 7:51-53: \"You stiff-necked people, with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You are just like your fathers: You always resist the Holy Spirit!  Was there ever a prophet your fathers did not persecute? They even killed those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One. And now you have betrayed and murdered him - you who have received the law that was put into effect through angels but have not obeyed it.\" \n \n Also note all the Old Testament prophets who condemned sin and corrupt moral leadership, and who were persecuted for their discernment and duty.\n \n Finally, when someone accuses you of being judgmental, are they not being critical and judgmental in making that accusation?\n \n Now you have a more accurate depiction of what Matthew 7 is all about.\n \n Gay sex is a sin (Leviticus 18:22; 20:13, Romans 1:26-27, I Cor. 6:9-10, Jude 7, etc.).",

   "I think I know a little something about love, perhaps more than you do.\n\n \n You don't have a clue regarding what true love is mariel, you just know what feels good according to the flesh and confuse that for love. Love is an action, not a feeling. And the truth Easyrider is telling you above is a perfect act of love since the truth he shares could lead to salvation if taken as it is intended.\n \n \nI don't believe we \"inherited\" our sins from \"Adam and Eve\" which are metaphorical images. \n\n \n YOU DON'T BELIEVE... Well there you go! You admit that you deny and reject the spiritual truths in Gods word from its very beginning regarding our origins. And in every other regard where the bible requires us to submit to Gods authority as our Creator Father, who wants what's best for us, you reject that also in favor of what you perceive to be reality. \n \n You actually believe that in your life span which is a speck of dust in comparison to the age of the author of life that you have the perspective to figure out what is true and right regarding how life should be lived?\n \n \nWe choose to commit sin, but I don't believe that two people who love each other are committing sin by being together, any more than a husband and wife having sex do.\n\n \n Again, YOU DON'T BELIEVE! By what standard should we care at all about what you do or don't believe? What qualifies you to over rule your creator who makes it clear throughout the Old and New Testament that He considers homosexuality and abomination and a scourge on its practitioners?\n \n \n We are animals, but apparently you don't believe in evolution. So we are part of the animal kingdom, part of the \"natural order\" as are homosexuals.\n\n \n You're right, I don't believe in evolution. There is no absolute evidence regarding evolution at all. It is merely the secular humanist's attempt to interpret the visible evidence which meets their natural vision for how life came to be. \n \n You lower yourself to the level of an animal while denying the extreme differences between humanity and the animal kingdom. You can't explain why in the alleged hundreds of millions of years of evolution when according to that same evolutionary theory where man is one of the most recent species to appear on the evolutionary tree of life, why no other species of animal has adapted to or evolved the power to reason, imagine or create the processes to force the world around them to serve them as we have to serve our needs? Only Humanity creates, why haven't the older species on the evolutionary track accomplished that sophistication long before we ever even came along if evo is real and true?\n \n If you even have the moxy to attempt to answer that question, it will be only an opinion with absolutely no evidence to support it at all. \n \n \nALthouth some want to believe we have immortal souls which are \"God's Image\" not our bodies. or do you think we look like God? God has a body? God is a man?\n\n \n Once again you just reveal how little you know about who you are. God said Let US make Man in OUR image, in OUR image WE will make him. Who was God speaking to mariel? He was speaking to Himself, the trinity, the three in one. And He created Man in His image by creating us with a body, a soul and a spirit which is a reflection of Himself, God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit. \n \n \n You say you love homosexuals, as Christ does, but many do not and use the bible to justify their hatred and fear.\n\n \n I can't speak for anyone else who claims to be believers in Christ. And neither can I explain or justify their abuse of the bible to support their hatred as I wont defend your ignorant abuse of the bible since you don't have a clue about what it really says about the issues we debate here.\n \n \nYou must have a very inflated image of yourself to think you are an Archangel.\n\n \n Angels are servants of God. If you understood their nature or place in eternity you wouldn't make such an ignorant statement. But once again, your knowledge is no greater than that of a child who believes the fairy tales of children.\n \n \n \"Judge not lest thou shall be judged\" - did I get that one right enough for you?\n\n \n Yeah, as quoting a passage goes. Now tell me what it means in proper spiritual context.",

It wasn't for me or anyone I know. Did you choose to be straight? If so, let me know who you talk to in order to get straight without living a lie or being tortured. I'd love to be straight, but that's not how life worked out.\n \n 2) See above.\n \n 3) I haven't read the bible, so I can't comment on context and such. But I'm gonna quote Elliot Stabler here, \"And the Bible says I can sell my daughters into slavery. Twelve years of Catholic school. Doesn't make them righteous.\" \n \n 4) Again, I haven't read the bible and I'm not about to waste my time on your God.\n \n 5) And it's not hostile to deny us the rights you have and use slurs against us?\n \n 6) School is for learning, basic skills, socializing, and accepting people as they are. What will children learn if we keep parents in the closet and tell the kid to lie?\n \n 7) Apparently it's a sin to be sick? I never heard that one. Good for you! You stopped being predictable! Not only do I worship satan for being bi, but I apparently sinned at the age of two when I first got sick! I wonder if it was unrolling the toilet paper that did it.\n \n 8) Do you repent after having sex with your wife? It's the same thing, same act, just different body parts.",

   "Go tell it to your pet carp.\n \n \n I don;t have a pet carp but I could say the same thing about your posts as well. They have alot more venom in them than a rattlesnake. \n \n \nIt's obvious that the radical left-wing pro-gay nut cases hate anyone who takes a Biblically-based stand in opposition to their politically correct carnality.

But even if there were we'd take an equally stellar stance against those. We don't want to hear about it.\n\n \n And there are those that take a biblically based stance FOR gay rights Easy. There are two sides to every coin. You post like it is a holy war, when in fact all gays want are the same rights and freedoms you take for granted daily.\n \n As far as gay pride, it is an outward manifestation of coming out. Sure some things are lewd I will admit, and I would like to see some of the more out there forms of expression tuned down, but the message is still that we are here and we are just as vibrant a community and as diverse as straits.\n \n \nSecond, most homosexuals who claim to be Christian try to persuade others it's not a sin, leading many (many) into perdition. We don't want to see even one soul lost. \n\n \n No Easy you don't want to see your views lost to fact and truth. Gay Christians don't seek to change YOUR views because they already know Christ loves them. It is you who cannot see the full reality and depth of the love of Jesus.\n \n \nThird, most homosexuals distort the scriptures in some fashion or another in order to try to justify their sin. The distort who Jesus is (saying he's not God so he never spoke out against gay sex sin); they make lengthly arguments against Leviticus, Romans 1:26-27, I Corinthians 6:9-10, etc. Generally, they attack the Word of God and thus attack God himself. We defend the Word and God.\n\n \n You defend prejudice and bigotry with scripture. You slander and scorn others and make death threats against them. That is not salvation Easy that is using the Bible as a weapon.\n \n \nFourth: Sin is a reproach to individuals and nations and brings God's disfavor on men and nations. Read Deuteronomy chapter 28 to see the curses of disobedience.\n\n \n And yet America is the most blessed and wealthy nation in the world....\n \n \n \n \nFifth, they attack the Sons and Daughters of God when we stand up for the truth of God's Word. They call us bigots, homophobes, and all manner of names because we disagree with their stance. They become extremely hostile.\n\n \n Attack? Easy we don;t have people in the name of God coming up and trying to take away your marriage or your right to visit your wife in the hospital or try to make it to where strait people cannot adopt. YOU are doing that! If anyone is attacking it is you!!\n \n \nSixth, they push their illicit agenda into every corner of America. Suing the Boy Scouts and anyone else who disagrees with them. They try and sometimes succeed in pushing their gay agenda in elementary schools and elsewhere where it doesn't belong. Seven year old children shouldn't have to hear that Billy's daddy is doing another guy, or that it's ok to do it. They push their agenda in people's faces until we're quite sick of it. We don't need to know which way people perform sex acts. Keep it in your bedroom.\n\n \n Easy you take this too far. Openly gay father cannot serve in the boy scouts because of the prejudice and sterotype that all gay men are pedophiles. Such a lie and hateful idea was the main pitching point for prop 6 which Harvey Milk fought and defeated.\n \n They only want to aid and teach those the same way strait fathers do because some have sons of their own. As far as this \"agenda\" you speak of trying to demonize the gay movement all we seek once again, is equal rights Easy. Not to force anything down anyone's throat. However, homophobia and bullying against gay teens is an epidemic. one out of three teen suicides each year is from being gay or lesbian. LGBT youth are 10 times more likely to contemplate suicide and three times as high to attempt it. This all stems from teasing bullying, and entrapment. The numbers are there Easy. It's a horrible thing dealing with. I did when I was a teenager. Theres nothing worse than putting a gun to your mouth because you hate yourself and feel wretched..\n \n [QUOTE=Easyrider;371267]Seventh: (need I go on?) They (and heterosexual sinners) cost taxpayers untold billions in unnecessary health care costs to treat AIDS and other diseases they give to each other. It costs us all money out of our pockets.\n \n Another version of the \"gay\" disease. Your such an ignorant person Easy. HIV not only affects gays but straits. DO NOT pin our health care issues on an incurable disease that has affected the lives of millions. Especially those who were gay in the early 80's and received no treatment and abuse for being gay. My ex told me many horror stories when he visited hospitals trying to aid those suffering. So I would retract your comment fully unless you really want to XXXX people off...\n \n \n \nAnd eighth: They refuse to repent of it, making their own salvation and those who they lead astray a serious question mark.\n \n And there's more but that's for starters.\n\n \n Thank you for your 8 comments or stereotype, prejudice, and misconception. Only 2 more to go and you can make them another form of gods law.....",

It is no wonder Paul had such strong warning against carnality in scripture. Such things were truly seen as abominable.

Scriptural references to these sexual practices, both before and after Leviticus, show God's displeasure with them whether or not any ceremony or idolatry is involved.\n \n Response #2:\n \n Despite the UFMCC's contention that the word for abomination (toevah) is usually associated with idolatry, it in fact appears in Proverbs 6:16-19 in connection with sins having nothing to do with idolatry or pagan ceremony:\n \n There are six things the LORD hates, seven that are detestable [an abomination or toevah] to him: haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that are quick to rush into evil, a false witness who pours out lies and a man who stirs up dissension among brothers. \n \n Idolatry plays no part in these scriptures; clearly, then, toevah is not limited to idolatrous practices.\n \n Responding to Pro-Gay Theology\n \n Once again, you rape the Scriptures in order to try to justify illicit gay sex sin.

I am incapable of hate. I have been the victim OF hate Archie. I carry it's scars on my heart and on my body daily. I see what blind rage and misplaced falsehood can do. I have seen and witnessed senseless violence and I see a struggle and a fight which must be one so that all Americans are truly equal.\n \n \n \n \n Archie once again you try and justify your brash and senseless bigotry upon that of a carnal nature. You clearly fail to see that it is NOT about sex! I can affirm that my partner and I have had no intimate relations in well over a year and a half. And yet it is NOT about sex! We LOVE each other Archie. We yearn for one another and are committed monogamous people who value each others hearts over carnality.\n \n I am not selfish Archie. I am not a sex addict. And I certainly have invested in eternal life through the grace of Christ. And I invite anyone to see the message of Christ for what it truly is. Not self indignation or prejudice, or self righteous scorn upon those who may not believe. But a message of hope and love payed forth by that of the almighty who's wisdom and unyielding love and depth of knowledge cannot be measured by me and certainly not by you Archie.\n \n THIS is true Christianity Archie. Love with out condition of the heart. Love without prejudice or biased assumption of others. Aid and care from the burning depths of our beating hearts to aid those with little or those with none. THAT is true Christianity Archie.\n \n And for you to sit there and say that you are a true Christian when you fail to even produce one ounce of love or compassion towards those who's entire lives may be lacking of that one simple yet vital need, shows clearly that your vested interest are only of self and turn a blind eye and a deaf ear to those who cry out in pain and cry out for a helping hand in this life...\n\n \n Once again, you're trying to justify illicit gay sex sin by demonizing other people (in this case Archie) and his beliefs. Is that what they teach you in those pro-gay marches? Smear whoever you feel you need to in an effort to try to legitimize unbiblical homosexual sin?",

You don't realize that they are not evil but are afflicted by these evil forces which seek to destroy them. \n \n But not just homosexuals but every type of sexual perversion may very well be a result of this type of influence. We will find out the extent on the final day. But thanks for once again bringing up this aspect of the spiritual battle we are in as it bears repeating and you seem obsessed with the concept. It's just really sad that you seem intent on mocking it rather than accepting the reality of the spiritual battle which we are in.

But then it's real clear that you'll say and do anything to try to justify your gay sex sin. Harvey Milk may have been a big name in Sodom and Gomorrah mindsets but not anywhere else. \n \n You need to re-read the following (from a prior post):\n\n \n \nLev. 18:22, \"You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination.\"1\n\n \n \n \n \nLev. 20:13, \"If there is a man who lies with a male as those who lie with a woman, both of them have committed a detestable act; they shall surely be put to death. Their bloodguiltness is upon them\"\n\n \n Leviticus 18:6 reads: \"You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female. It is an abomination.\" A similar verse occurs two chapters later, in Leviticus 20:13: \"A man who sleeps with another man is an abomination and should be executed.\" On the surface, these words could leave you feeling rather uneasy, especially if you are gay. But just below the surface is the deeper truth about God -- and it has nothing to do with sex.\n \n Leviticus is a holiness code written 3,000 years ago. This code includes many of the outdated sexual laws we mentioned earlier, and a lot more. It also includes prohibitions against round haircuts, tattoos, working on the Sabbath, wearing garments of mixed fabrics, eating pork or shellfish, getting your fortune told, and even playing with the skin of a pig. (There goes football!)\n \n So what's a holiness code? It's a list of behaviors that people of faith find offensive in a certain place and time. In this case, the code was written for priests only, and its primary intent was to set the priests of Israel over and against priests of other cultures.\n \n At the age of 10, I signed a holiness code written by the Women's Christian Temperance Union that said I would never taste beer, wine, or liquor. I thought signing it would please God and my grandmother. That's a holiness code. When I was in high school we evangelical Christians had an unwritten holiness code that went like this: \"I don't drink, smoke, or chew, or go with girls who do.\" Now I know what you're thinking. That last part about \"girls who do\" proved especially easy for me. But the point is that I obeyed this evangelical holiness code because my parents said that breaking these rules didn't please God, and I knew it didn't please them.\n \n We had another evangelical holiness code while I was in high school that prohibited dancing. I was student body president, yet I refused to go to the prom because I had promised not to dance. I did this to please God and my mother -- whose mother had made her sign a holiness code that she wouldn't go to dances either.\n \n What about this word abomination that comes up in both passages? In Hebrew, \"abominations\" (TO'EBAH) are behaviors that people in a certain time and place consider tasteless or offensive. To the Jews an abomination was not a law, not something evil like rape or murder forbidden by the Ten Commandments. It was a common behavior by non-Jews that Jews thought was displeasing to God.\n \n Jesus and Paul both said the holiness code in Leviticus does not pertain to Christian believers. Nevertheless, there are still people who pull the two verses about men sleeping together from this ancient holiness code to say that the Bible seems to condemn homosexuality.\n \n But wait, before we go any further, let's ask: What does this text say about God? Even if the old holiness codes no longer apply to us as Christians, it's important to remember that in every age, people of faith are responsible for setting moral and ethical standards that honor God. But we people of faith must be very careful not to allow our own prejudices to determine what those standards should be.\n \n Instead of selecting one item from an ancient Jewish holiness code and using it to condemn sexual or gender minorities, let's talk together about setting sexual standards that please God -- standards appropriate for heterosexuals and homosexuals alike, standards based on loving concern, health, and wholeness for ourselves and for others.\n \n Now what do the Leviticus passages say about homosexuality?\n \n I'm convinced those passages say nothing about homosexuality as we understand it today. Here's why. Consider this single Bible passage that was used for centuries to condemn masturbation:\n \n \"He spilled his seed on the ground... And the thing which Onan did displeased the Lord: wherefore he slew him also\" (Genesis 38:9-10).\n \n For Jewish writers of Scripture, a man sleeping with another man was an abomination. But it was also an abomination (and one worthy of death) to masturbate or even to interrupt coitus (to halt sex with your spouse before ejaculation as an act of birth control). Why were these sexual practices considered abominations by Scripture writers in these ancient times?\n \n Because the Hebrew pre-scientific understanding was that the male semen contained the whole of life. With no knowledge of eggs and ovulation, it was assumed that the man's sperm contained the whole child and that the woman provided only the incubating space. Therefore, the spilling of semen without possibility of having a child was considered murder.\n \n The Jews were a small tribe struggling to populate a country. They were outnumbered by their enemy. You can see why these ancient people felt it was an abomination to risk \"wasting\" even a single child. But the passage says nothing about homosexuality as we understand it today.\n \n We've talked about the passages in the Hebrew Scriptures that are used (or misused) by some people to condemn sexual minorities. Now let's look at three verses from the letters of the apostle Paul in the Christian Scriptures that are used the same way. Remember: First, we'll ask what the text says about God; second, we'll consider what it may or may not say about sexual orientation.\n \n \n1 Cor. 6:9-10, \"Or do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, 10nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, shall inherit the kingdom of God.\"\n\n \n PASSAGES 5 AND 6\n 1 CORINTHIANS 6:9 AND 1 TIMOTHY 1:10\n THE MYSTERY OF \"MALOKOIS\" AND \"ARSENOKOITAI\"\n \n Now what do the writings of Paul in 1 Corinthians 6:9 and 1 Timothy 1:10 say, first, about God, and then about homosexuality? These are the last two places in the Bible that seem to refer to same-sex behavior. We can combine them because they are so similar.\n \n Moses holding the ten commandmentsPaul is exasperated. The Christians in Ephesus and Corinth are fighting among themselves. (Sound familiar?) In Corinth they're even suing one another in secular courts. Paul shouts across the distance, \"You are breaking God's heart by the way you are treating one another.\"\n \n Like any good writer, Paul anticipates their first question: \"Well, how are we supposed to treat one another?\" Paul answers, \"You know very well how to treat one another from the Jewish law written on tablets of stone.\"\n \n The Jewish law was created by God to help regulate human behavior. To remind the churches in Corinth and Ephesus how God wants us to treat one another, Paul recites examples from the Jewish law first. Don't kill one another. Don't sleep with a person who is married to someone else. Don't lie or cheat or steal. The list goes on to include admonitions against fornication, idolatry, whoremongering, perjury, drunkenness, revelry, and extortion. He also includes \"malokois\" and \"arsenokoitai.\"\n \n Here's where the confusion begins. What's a malokois? What's an arsenokoitai? Actually, those two Greek words have confused scholars to this very day. We'll say more about them later, when we ask what the texts say about sex. But first let's see what the texts say about God.\n \n After quoting from the Jewish law, Paul reminds the Christians in Corinth that they are under a new law: the law of Jesus, a law of love that requires us to do more than just avoid murder, adultery, lying, cheating, and stealing. Paul tells them what God wants is not strict adherence to a list of laws, but a pure heart, a good conscience, and a faith that isn't phony.\n \n That's the lesson we all need to learn from these texts. God doesn't want us squabbling over who is \"in\" and who is \"out.\" God wants us to love one another. It's God's task to judge us. It is NOT our task to judge one another.\n \n So what do these two texts say about homosexuality? Are gays and lesbians on that list of sinners in the Jewish law that Paul quotes to make an entirely different point?\n \n Greek scholars say that in first century the Greek word malaokois probably meant \"effeminate call boys.\" The New Revised Standard Version says \"male prostitutes.\"\n \n As for arsenokoitai, Greek scholars don't know exactly what it means -- and the fact that we don't know is a big part of this tragic debate. Some scholars believe Paul was coining a name to refer to the customers of \"the effeminate call boys.\" We might call them \"dirty old men.\" Others translate the word as \"sodomites,\" but never explain what that means.\n \n In 1958, for the first time in history, a person translating that mysterious Greek word into English decided it meant homosexuals, even though there is, in fact, no such word in Greek or Hebrew. But that translator made the decision for all of us that placed the word homosexual in the English-language Bible for the very first time.\n \n In the past, people used Paul's writings to support slavery, segregation, and apartheid. People still use Paul's writings to oppress women and limit their role in the home, in church, and in society.\n \n Now we have to ask ourselves, \"Is it happening again?\" Is a word in Greek that has no clear definition being used to reflect society's prejudice and condemn God's gay children?\n \n We all need to look more closely at that mysterious Greek word arsenokoitai in its original context. I find most convincing the argument from history that Paul is condemning the married men who hired hairless young boys (malakois) for sexual pleasure just as they hired smooth-skinned young girls for that purpose.\n \n Responsible homosexuals would join Paul in condemning anyone who uses children for sex, just as we would join anyone else in condemning the threatened gang rape in Sodom or the behavior of the sex-crazed priests and priestesses in Rome. So, once again, I am convinced that this passage says a lot about God, but nothing about homosexuality as we understand it today.\n \n \nRom. 1:26-28, \"For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural, 27and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error. 28And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not proper.\"\n\n \n \n What does Romans 1:26-27 say about God?\n \n For our discussion, this is the most controversial biblical passage of them all. In Romans 1:26-27 the apostle Paul describes non-Jewish women who exchange \"natural use for unnatural\" and non-Jewish men who \"leave the natural use of women, working shame with each other.\"\n \n This verse appears to be clear: Paul sees women having sex with women and men having sex with men, and he condemns that practice. But let's go back 2,000 years and try to understand why.\n \n Paul is writing this letter to Rome after his missionary tour of the Mediterranean. On his journey Paul had seen great temples built to honor Aphrodite, Diana, and other fertility gods and goddesses of sex and passion instead of the one true God the apostle honors. Apparently, these priests and priestesses engaged in some odd sexual behaviors -- including castrating themselves, carrying on drunken sexual orgies, and even having sex with young temple prostitutes (male and female) -- all to honor the gods of sex and pleasure.\n \n The Bible is clear that sexuality is a gift from God. Our Creator celebrates our passion. But the Bible is also clear that when passion gets control of our lives, we're in deep trouble.\n \n When we live for pleasure, when we forget that we are God's children and that God has great dreams for our lives, we may end up serving the false gods of sex and passion, just as they did in Paul's time. In our obsession with pleasure, we may even walk away from the God who created us -- and in the process we may cause God to abandon all the great dreams God has for our lives.\n \n Did these priests and priestesses get into these behaviors because they were lesbian or gay? I don't think so. Did God abandon them because they were practicing homosexuals? No. Read the text again.\n \n In our Soulforce video, There's a Wideness in God's Mercy, the Rev. Dr. Louis B. Smedes, a distinguished Christian author and ethicist, describes exactly how the Bible says these promiscuous priests and priestesses got into this mess. Once again it has nothing to do with homosexuality:\n \n SMEDES: \"The people Paul had in mind refused to acknowledge and worship God, and for this reason were abandoned by God. And being abandoned by God, they sank into sexual depravity.\"\n \n SMEDES: \"The homosexuals I know have not rejected God at all; they love God and they thank God for his grace and his gifts. How, then, could they have been abandoned to homosexuality as a punishment for refusing to acknowledge God?\"\n \n SMEDES: \"Nor have the homosexuals that I know given up heterosexual passions for homosexual lusts. They have been homosexual from the moment of their earliest sexual stirrings. They did not change from one orientation to another; they just discovered that they were homosexual. It would be unnatural for most homosexuals to have heterosexual sex.\"\n \n SMEDES: \"And the homosexual people I know do not lust after each other any more than heterosexual people do... their love for one another is likely to be just as spiritual and personal as any heterosexual love can be.\"\n \n Thank you, Dr. Smedes. (To get a copy of the video featuring Dr. Smedes, There's a Wideness in God's Mercy, visit Soulforce : Freedom for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender People.)\n \n Getting to know a lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender person of faith will help you realize that it is unreasonable (and unjust) to compare our love for each other to the rituals of the priests and priestesses who pranced around the statues of Aphrodite and Diana. Once again, I feel certain this passage says a lot about God, but nothing about homosexuality as we understand it.\n \n You'll also note that Romans 2 begins with \"Therefore, [referring to Romans 1], you have no excuse, whoever you are, when you judge others; for in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself...\" Even after he describes the disturbing practices he has seen, Paul warns us that judging others is God's business, not ours.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n That is my belief Easy and my interpretation. Your may be different but that is mine. But I expect you to refuse to read it either so it makes no difference really on your opinion...",

Easy I would like you to watch on youtube \"for the bible tells me so\" it is a documentary about very faith based families, some even being ministers in very conservative areas of America raising children and then dealing with them being Gay.\n \n It is not biased, but takes a look at the human element, and the social conflicts that gay teens especially those of faith backgrounds endure. It looks at the social impact, the cultural shift, and balances both views from both sides. \n \n You assume gay people are all about sex. When I think of my partner it is not of sex, but of love. I think of him with admiration and a mutual respect and cherishing of one another. We mean to raise a family, and to love them. This is not your typical spin of gays with their pro gay sex and their promiscuous \"lifestyle\". \n \n Are there gays that engage in promiscuity? Yes. Just as there are strait people. But there are also gay couples that have been together for 10, 20, 30, 40 years or more who have remained committed and loving to one another. And have raised families in a loving caring home.\n \n \n What you fear, yes I said fear Easy is that due to a shift in culture. Due to a broader understanding and insight into our lives, understanding who we as gay people are, show and debunk the myths and the lies about us! You cannot fathom that we, as gay people could love Christ and BE loved by Christ and love our partners with as much fervor as any heterosexual couple!\n \n You cannot fathom that we as gay people, can raise children in a loving caring home, and that we can and are productive members of society, that we are just as diverse and talented as any other group of people.\n \n What scares you is that day by day the wall of prejudice is being torn down. No matter how many times you beat us, tie us to fences and leave us to die. No matter how many insults people slur, or jests that they spew from the pulpit, you cannot stop and cannot change the feeling in peoples hearts now.",
