   "Some people do argue that love is not necessary. You are one of them.\n \n What you are forgetting is that everyone has the right to become married. Therefore, from a standpoint that does not involve love, no rights are being infringed upon by denying men to marry men and women to marry women, because all men can marry a woman and all women can marry a man, thereby obtaining the special privelages associated with marriage.\n\n \n This statement is incorrect. It is true that all people have the right to get married to someone. But it is not true that no rights are being infringed upon, for no person has the right to marry someone of the same sex. That is a right, and that right is being denied to everyone.\n \n Looking at the situation logically, the people who would use same-sex marriage, the people who might love someone of the same sex, are homosexuals and bisexuals. The denial of same-sex marriage exists as a specific restriction on marriage, and that restriction can only logically be construed to be harmful to homosexuals or bisexuals for they are the only ones who would use same-sex marriage. So it is not unreasonable to say that gays are denied rights. Although everyone is denied rights, those are rights that would only be used by gays and bisexuals, so it is not unfair or untruthful in any way to say that the rights of gays and bisexuals are being infringed upon. The discussion can only logically be over whether that infringement is a good thing or a bad thing.",

In fact, I would go so far as to state that allowing an individual to marry himself actually isn't harming anyone. Unlike same-sex marriage, it isn't benefiting anyone, but if we are to be a free nation, we should allow things that are harmless, even if they have no benefit, for the sake of freedom.\n \n In truth, I wouldn't be all that opposed to allowing someone to marry him or herself. I mean, there wouldn't really be any additional benefit. What would you get? Access to your own property rights? Your own medical benefits? The ability to claim yourself as a dependant on your tax returns? In truth, if you married yourself, you wouldn't get any additional benefits, and there would be absolutely no legal change.\n \n So although legalizing same-sex marriage wouldn't really cause much harm, legally it would mean absolutely nothing, and it be doing more clustering of our legal system with useless laws and regulations than anything else. It doesn't really make any more legal sense to allow one to marry himself than it does to allow one to adopt himself. I guess we could allow that, but that would really do nothing except allow people to file paperwork that did nothing but keep our laws exactly the same.\n \n Someone whose religion or beliefs state that marriage to oneself is an acceptable usage of the term \"marriage\" and is just as much a commitment as any two-person marriage might claim that our failure to create a law to accomodate his religion teaches people that his religion is wrong. In some sense, I suppose that is true. However, in a more realistic sense, there's a lot of good reasons not to clutter our legal system with laws that do nothing, and that obvious fact means that the harm to his religion should be very minimal. It is a very different thing to fail to create an insitution that does nothing than it is to fail to create an institution that provides benefits for couples who can use those benefits.\n \n What I can say is that if it did make sense to allow an individual to marry himself or herself, it would be absurd to create a seperate institution called \"civil unions\" to accomplish the same thing. If we did that, then we truly would be teaching that people who marry themselves are worse people than those who marry someone else. That would be the promotion of my beliefs over someone else's, the elevation of myself and my lifestyle above another man's. That is not a moral action.",

Currently an unmarried person has legal custody over his own children. If you married yourself, that custody would remain the same. Insurance breaks and tax benefits, if I am not mistaken, come in the form of one's ability to claim his or her spouse and that spouse's children as dependants, as well as with the ability to file jointly. In the case of marrying yourself, you increase your dependants by 0 and filing jointly with yourself could be interpreted as either doing nothing or making you pay the taxes of two people instead of one. I don't know much about military store access, but I thought it was granted due to marrying a veteran or member of the military. If that is the case, marrying yourself would again grant you no access that you do not already have. I am not positive what you mean by \"reduced rate memberships\". I might be wrong on what you meant, so I'd appreciate it if you could go into more detail on what these benefits you're describing are.\n \n But to be even more simple about it, I'd agree that it doesn't make sense to give married people benefits that could also be extended to single people. The benefits of marriage, in my understanding, essentially just allow you to add a single other person and their children to your immediate family. Adding yourself to your family doesn't really change anything.\n \n I have no problem with single people saying they are married to themselves, and if they want, I'll say, \"Yes, you are married to yourself\". Why would I care about that? But I understand the difference between the spiritual meaning of \"marriage\" and a set of legal rights and benefits under the law, and giving a single person the right to add himself to his own family simply doesn't do or change anything at all and is totally unnecessary.\n \n Our law should be designed to treat his religion and his lifestyle as well as it treats mine in every respect. If there is some special marriage right that a man who marries himself can have, then perhaps we need to consider giving him that right. And we shouldn't be giving it just to him, but to all unmarried people as well. Marriage benefits should be those benefits that are necessary for adding a new member to your family, not benefits that elevate married people over single people. But as I said: we don't need to give someone the legal right to do nothing, and that is what I think giving people the right to enter this legal contract with themselves would do.",

I'd be much more inclined to believe that a single person has a greater need for education and dependant credits than does a jointly filing couple, and I see no reason that someone filing independantly should not recieve those same benefits.\n \n In the case of special rates offered by a company to married individuals, well that is the decision of that company, and that company's right to choose what to charge its customers should not be infringed upon unless we start coming across a widespread or potentially widespread problem. Since a pub is probably more likely to give half off on drinks to single guys, I don't think we're looking at a problem in that respect. If there is any sort of discrimination going on in the business world against single guys or guys who are married to themselves, then I've not no problem addressing that issue on its own terms. But that's a pretty seperate issue from same-sex marriage.\n \n I am uncertain where you came up with the idea that allowing an individual to marry himself makes that marriage instantly recognized by everyone. In fact, I'd be willing to wager that the vast majority of people would not recognize that marriage. In fact, I'm guessing almost no one would even know it happened. If one wants to have people recognize his marriage, he should declare his marriage and commitment, as many gay couples currently do. But the argument you've presented doesn't seem correct to me.\n \n One might argue that our law teaches people that marrying oneself is morally wrong. However, I'm not certain that it does, for under the legal understanding of the term marriage, it is effectively adding another family member. Since adding yourself to your own family does not logically follow, it should seem obvious to anyone observing that this is the reason our laws do not provide benefits because those benefits largely do not make sense when applied to oneself, not because of any moral implications. As evidence of that line of thought, we certainly don't see many people around preaching against marrying oneself. Perhaps the best solution to this problem would simply be to change the name of the legal institution of \"marriage\" to something else so that people are not so easily confused between their religious commitment to their spouse and a legal institution.\n \n Let's cut to the point: I think what you are trying to imply is that if same-sex marriage makes sense, then so does marrying yourself. But realistically, there is a pretty practical reason not to allow marriage to oneself: the results of marriage to oneself simply don't make sense. The same cannot be said of same-sex marriage.\n \n I should also point out that the societal benefits of marriage: raising children with enough income, giving children a loving family, teaching our children to be kind and tolerant of others, providing financial stability to people who fall on hard times, providing emotional support to other family members, allowing people to more easily afford to live with their loved ones, etc are all promoted by allowing same-sex marriage. Although this isn't my primary argument, it can easily be seen that same-sex marriage provides benefits equal to that of opposite-sex marriage and far greater than that of allowing a single individual to marry. Before you state that same-sex couples cannot have children, understand that such a claim is a myth propogated by people whose religious values do not permit having sex outside a marriage or using a surrogate parent. Indeed, same-sex couples are as able to have children as opposite-sex couples.\n \n Considering what I have just said, I would then challenge you to explain why opposite-sex couples deserve marriage while a single individual does not deserve to be allowed to marry himself. The same reasons you might use to suggest that same-sex marriage mandates single-person marriage can be used to suggest that opposite-sex marriage mandates single-person marriage. But neither claim holds any validity. \n \n There is a very solid reason not to allow an individual to marry himself, while there are no reasons to disallow same-sex marriage. There are no benefits to anyone if single-person marriage is allowed, or if there are actually benefits to the invidual who marries himself, we should grant those benefits to all single people, in my personal opinion. Finally, there is no distinct difference between same-sex marriage and opposite-sex marriage which suggests that same-sex marriage mandates single-person marriage while opposite-sex marriage does not.\n \n But most importantly, if even after all that, you still do not agree with my reasoning, then I guess our only option is to allow a person to marry himself. The harm caused by that, if any, would be far, far smaller than the harm caused by disallowing same-sex couples the right to marry. Maybe the morality of allowing a single person to marry himself is uncertain to you, but the morality of allowing a same-sex couple to marry should not be.",

Hence this is one reason to get married.\n\n \n The government can encourage marriage enough by creating benefits through it that are not possible across a single person. These benefits already exist: the ability to add a person to your family, to claim that person and that person's children as your dependants, to give that person your health insurance, to naturalize that person, to share property, etc. But we shouldn't be giving people tax breaks just for the sake of being married. If we think married people need a higher tax break to help them raise children, we should make that a tax break on dependants as a whole, for surely a single person needs those benefits for their own dependants.\n \n \nYou say self-marriage follows as equally from heterosexual marriage as it does same-sex.

Both result from a claim of infringement of rights due to a perception of love, and neither self-marriage nor gay-marriage carry more weight than the other.\n\n \n So you are saying that if it is suddenly \"revealed\" that nothing is \"protecting the definition of marriage\", then suddenly we'll begin changing it like crazy? That is nonsense. It is irrational to claim that one sensible change will suddenly cause people to institute a second change that makes no sense. And that is precisely what you are suggesting will happen when you imply that same-sex marriage goes hand-in-hand with marrying oneself. One of those is reasonable and helps countless people. The other is nothing more than an irrational request to allow one man to enter into a legal contract with himself. It makes no sense, and it helps no one. If we really want a single person to have the benefits of marriage, then we should give them to single people whether that person has \"married himself\" or not. There is no need for an individual to enter into some legal contract with himself to grant those benefits. Our lawmakers aren't suddenly going to lose all understanding of the law if same-sex marriage is legalized.\n \n \nWhy wouldn't a self-marriage be recognized by everyone? If I have a wedding ceremony, wear a ring, and sign the dotted lines, under the law I must be recognized as legally married. His wedding and wedding ring would be a proclamation of his commitment to his love for himself.\n\n \n As I stated, few people would even know the self-marriage happened. But let's say they did. Those people's religion would certainly not call it a \"marriage\". Although the person might have created a legal contract with himself, that does not have and should not have any bearing on whether people recognize that marriage in a spiritual sense. Though if you're asking whether those people would acknowledge that the law has made some accomodation for that individual, then certainly that is the truth. But people aren't going to change their religious beliefs just because the law has granted that individual the right to practice his own religious beliefs.\n \n \nI agree, out law certainly does not teach that self-marriage is wrong, as long as it demonstrates that the definition of marriage is not fixed.\n\n \n Then the law should not demostrate that the definition of marriage is fixed, for certainly the law has no place suggesting that \"self-marriage\" is wrong. An individual should be able to hold whatever religious or spiritual belief he chooses without fear of persecution and without the law teaching other people that his beliefs are wrong.\n \n \nYour claim about same-sex partners being equally good for society as opposite-sex gives me nothing to go on but empty claims. Likewise, I claim that hetero couples make far better parents because they instill in their children a sense of decency, a lack of perversion, and demonstrate the love and trust that both sexes are capable of. This allows the child to grow up balanced and socially and morally adept. Can you disprove this?\n\n \n I listed a series of facts to support my claim. You can certainly verify that same-sex couples are able to have surrogate parents, are able to provide the same amount of financial and emotional stability, and are able to provide loving families for their children, as well as everything else I said. They are not unjustified claims in any sense of the word, and it is inaccurate to describe them as such.\n \n I cannot disprove your claims, but neither can you prove them. There are a lot of things that cannot be proven. What I can do is provide well-reasoned logic and evidence which suggest that you are wrong. I can further explain that since you cannot prove same-sex couples are inferior, you are not justified in denying them marriage. I shall attempt to do so:\n \n Same-sex couples only instill in their children a sense of decency and perversion if you begin with the assumption that same-sex relationships are indecent or preverted. To begin with such an assumption, we must show that they are either somehow harmful or we must assume a specific belief system. As it happens, same-sex relationships are not harmful in any sense, and if we begin with my religion, they are completely acceptable. Although a majority of people may hold some religious belief that same-sex relationships are indecent or preverted, that is no indication that the rights of a minority should be infringed upon, for doing so would be doing nothing but putting the majority religion into law.\n \n To suggest that same-sex couples are not able to show the love and trust that both sexes are capable of implies three false things:\n \n First it implies that each sex has a different form of love or trust. There is no reason to believe that such a thing is true; it appears very clear to me that both sexes have the same form and understanding of love and trust. Scientific and sociological studies suggest that \"common sense\" differences in our understanding of female and male love are created by societal pressure to behave in a certain fashion, not by real differences.\n \n Second, it implies that same-sex couples would not be able to teach the form of love and trust exhibited by a member of the opposite-sex, if such a difference in love or trust existed. But realistically, there is no indication that they could not teach the love and trust of an opposite sex, even if they did not exhibit it themselves. Even if they could not, we would expect society to teach it to them in their interactions with others.\n \n Finally, it implies that teaching our children these different versions of \"love and trust\" is actually a good thing for that child. Yet logically, if males and females exhibited different versions of love and trust, and if both actually have some merit to them, then our children should be taught to engage in either version of love or trust as necessary. An opposite-sex parent family with each parent teaching a different form of love and trust is likely to reinforce the idea that this child should be engaging in only the form of love and trust displayed by the parent of the same gender. It does not logically seem a good idea to teach a child to behave identically to one of his parents in all situations, but to choose which versions of love and trust he will engage in across any source. That seems easier to learn in a family where the child feels free to imitate either parent.\n \n \nYou say that if there are benefits to self-marriages, we should grant them to anyone. But by this reasoning, I can also say that if there are benefits to marriage, or same-sex marriage, we should grant them to all single people as well, or perhaps simply to all unmarried couples.\n\n \n Well, when you say that we should grant those benefits to all single people as well, I do see no reason that we should not, where applicable. Since it is impossible for a single person to add no one into his family, the benefits created by having a second family member don't really apply. I do not think we should allow a single person to create a fictional \"dependant\" for tax purposes, and I do not think a single person should be able to naturalize a fictional person into the US. I certainly don't think a single person should get the intellectual property rights of a person that does not exist, nor should he have the right to visit a fictional person in the hospital.\n \n When you say that we should grant those rights to all unmarried couples, well that is precisely what we do now. It just so happens that the legal process by which two spiritually unmarried people get those benefits is also named \"marriage\". The statement you made confuses the legal process by which people get benefits and the spiritual meaning of marriage.\n \n \nBut, since we continue to disagree, then I suppose our only option is to allow self-marriage as you say. Surely the damage by that would be very low. Or would it? A primary reason gays fight for same-sex marriage is for that \"instantaneous\" recognition of commitment that can only be understood by the word \"marriage.\" Would the word \"marriage\" retain it's weight if it were diluted with concepts such as self-marriage? \n\n \n The statement you have made here, and the reason I think you used the \"self-marriage\" example in the first place are flawed. Gays do not fight for same-sex marriage so they can have \"instantaneous recognition of commitment that can only be understood through the word marriage\". They aren't looking for any recognition of marriage except the legal kind. They simply want the law to treat their relationships the same as they treat anyone else's. They don't want this because it instantly grants them recognition; they want this because they want equal benefits under the law first, and they don't want the law to teach people that their beliefs, lifestyle or commitment is wrong or worse than anyone else's. It doesn't matter whether we legally call it marriage, just so long as it's called the same thing for everyone. And it doesn't matter whether anyone else \"instantly recognizes their marriage\".\n \n I think that the idea that legal marriage grants instant recognition of one's own relationship plays too much a part in the thinking of opponents of same-sex marriage. I think they want their own marriages will not be recognized above anyone else's. But an opposite-sex marriage shouldn't be recognized any sooner than a man marrying himself under the law. One man's lifestyle should not be legally recognized as better than the next man's.\n \n I also think you're incorrectly predicting negative consequences if any change to marriage is made. People will not suddenly interpret their commitment to their loved ones differently if same-sex marriage is legalized, nor even if self-marriage is legalized. It's just a word, and if that word no longer describes what you've got, then who cares about that word? Surely opposite-sex relationships are not so frail that the love and commitment involved in them is lost if the word that describes them also describes something else. Marriage is but a word; it doesn't make sense that your love or commitment will fade because you no longer value the word.\n \n But if anything, the addition of same-sex marriage should have positive consequences for the meaning of marriage. I cannot see a downside of marriage signifying \"the commitment and joining of two people who love each other\" instead of signifying \"the commitment and joining of two people who love each other, so long as they're of opposite sexes\".\n \n \nFinally, I still do not understand why self-married people should not get equal benefits as everyone else. Why shouldn't a marriage, consisting of me being married to myself, get a set of tasty social benefits like everyone else? It's healthy for society to have people who are confident and believe in and love themselves. We need to encourage that type of behavior.

The reasoning that, because current law does not support self-marriage in an economic sense, does not make it right. Me and myself demand benefits akin to those that other couples receive.\n\n \n Self-married people should get equal benefits to everyone else, not only equal, but exactly the same. I thought I had stated this, but here you are demanding that I give you equal benefits. However, it does not make sense to create an institution that allows people to add the person they love to their family, then to allow someone to add himself. If there are benefits that a single man could have which are given to married people, then we should discuss giving single people those benefits. But that is a different debate alltogether.\n \n I should mention finally, that the government has no place encouraging or discouraging any any type of behavior unless that behavior is harmful to and violates the rights of someone else.",

That's why gay marriage is so opposed--because of the cultural changes--the impact it has on the institution of marriage.\n\n \n Although many people in the gay rights movement wish for people to accept their relationships, but they not fighting to write that recognition into law, they are fighting to be treated equally. I do not doubt that people will come to accept same-sex marriages to a greater degree if same-sex marriage is legalized, and this will happen because our laws will no longer teach that opposite-sex marriage should be elevated above same-sex marriage. I also have no doubt that this will make many people happy. But I can assure you that the reason gay people fight to legalize same-sex marriage is not that they want people to recognize them, but simply because they want equal treatment under the law. It is not \"instantaneous recognition\" that they seek, it is a fair chance to promote their own beliefs and to be treated equally under the law. \n \n I should think that you would know the reasons for legalizing same-sex marriage as well as anyone. Those reasons do not include \"people will recognize same-sex couples\". Those reasons do include, \"same-sex couples are not treated fairly under the law\".\n \n Legalizing same-sex marriage will not have much impact on marriage, and that impact will be nothing but positive.

So long as the law gives opposite-sex marriage some special or even different title than same-sex marriage, that law is implying that the majority lifestyle or religion is somehow superior to the minority one. We don't give Christianity \"freedom of religion\" and Buddism \"liberty of the church\", and neither should we create some special right or institution to grant same-sex couples some different right under the law.\n \n Just as you question the intentions of supporters of same-sex marriage, I question the intentions of opponents.

I wonder if a supporter of same-sex marriage could use your same argument nearly verbatim to explain how same-sex marriage is different from polygamy:\n \n \"Same-sex marriage is an issue about homophobia, not marriage. Opponents of same-sex marriage were homophobes, and that's why they opposed it, not because they wanted to protect marriage (which wasn't threatened as an institution). With same-sex marriage, it was still two people marrying, and therefore no change was being sought to the fundamental standard of marriage.\"\n \n Does that not sound like something an supporter of same-sex marriage might say? In fact, I'd go so far as to say that it is exactly what a supporter of same-sex marriage might say when defending his stance against polygamy.\n \n And what do you think an opponent of interracial marriage would have said in response if he'd known that same-sex marriage would become an issue? Maybe something like:\n \n \"Regarding your comment of same-sex marriage--a supporter of same-sex marriage could argue the EXACT same points you are arguing nearly verbatim. This is the problem with broadening marriage so--it opens the door to anything.\"\n \n What I want you to notice is that you view interracial marriage in the same way same-sex marriage supporters view same-sex marriage. What I also want you to notice is that your argument can be used verbatim in opposition to interracial marriage. So before you start claiming that the debate over same-sex marriage bear no resemblance to the debate over interracial marriage, I think you should understand that the exact same arguments are or can be used by both sides verbatim across these two debates.\n \n But same-sex marriage and interracial marriage are two completely seperate things. You know that and I know that. I can repeat your exact same argument in support of interracial marriage and use it to support same-sex marriage. An opponent of interracial marriage could repeat your exact same argument in opposition to same-sex marriage and use it to support banning interracial marriage. But the reasons that those statements are true or false vary between each type of marriage.\n \n In the case of same-sex marriage, I can state that it is harmless and it helps many people. In the case of interracial marriage, I can state the same thing. In the case of polygamous marriage, I cannot say that because it creates an impractical legal institution in which one individual is able to grant benefits to as many people as he wants, giving him an advantage in benefits and forcing people to pay additional taxes to support such a relationship. A polygamous couple can already grant his marriage benefits to one other person in his relationship, and he those marriage benefits are already called the same as everyone else's. You can use the same arguments to support polygamous marriage, but the reasons behind those arguments are invalid or certainly require a completely different justification if they are valid.\n \n Another thing I want you to see, Jyoshu, and I saved this for last in hopes that you will better remember it, is that it was no problem for me to replace your word \"racist\" with \"homophobe\" and make the argument work exactly the same. I just hope that the next time someone calls you a homophobe, that you are willing to see things from that person's point of view. You are quick to call anyone who opposes interracial marriage a racist, but you take offense when people call you a homophobe for opposing same-sex marriage. I'm not saying that people are right for calling you a homophobe, but I'm sure quite a few people who oppose interracial marriage don't consider themselves racists. I'm just asking that you understand that everyone uses those sorts of names to describe their opponents sometimes and understand why they do it.",

Hence this is one reason to get married.\n \n You say self-marriage follows as equally from heterosexual marriage as it does same-sex. Consider this: if the definition of marriage is held fixed, so that it is defined as between two people, a man and a woman, it will be extended to neither self-marriage, nor same-sex. However, if the part of the definition containing man and woman is changed to \"persons,\" it is shown that there is nothing protecting the definition of marriage.\n\n \n Well, no, it will change the definition of one man and one women to two persons.

   "Wow this really blew up...\n \n \nAlthough many people in the gay rights movement wish for people to accept their relationships, but they not fighting to write that recognition into law, they are fighting to be treated equally. I do not doubt that people will come to accept same-sex marriages to a greater degree if same-sex marriage is legalized, and this will happen because our laws will no longer teach that opposite-sex marriage should be elevated above same-sex marriage.\n \n\n In what way would our laws be teaching that a civil union is worse than a marriage, if both afforded the exact same legal rights? The law would not be teaching that one is better, only that they are different. And to argue that a women marrying a man and a man marrying a man are the same thing is purely incorrect from any logical standpoint (a square is not a circle). This makes it quite obvious, then, that gays are in fact arguing for the recognition that comes with the word \"marriage\" (that is associated with the straight populace, as they do not want people to associate them with their own lifestyles, which I personally find to be the most ironic and humorous part of all). \n \n \n\n Activists are out for the legal benefit of marriage, but that benefit includes an impartial view of the morality of same-sex and opposite-sex marriage under the law. So long as the law gives opposite-sex marriage some special or even different title than same-sex marriage, that law is implying that the majority lifestyle or religion is somehow superior to the minority one. We don't give Christianity \"freedom of religion\" and Buddism \"liberty of the church\", and neither should we create some special right or institution to grant same-sex couples some different right under the law.\n \n\n Here you are begging the question. The reason Christianity and Buddhism both have the protection of \"freedom of religion\" is because both are under the larger tenant of religion. As I stated above, gay marriage and marriage are not the same thing. To say that they should both fall under the tenant \"marriage\" assumes first that the definition of marriage ought to include both.\n \n \n\n Just as you question the intentions of supporters of same-sex marriage, I question the intentions of opponents. If opponents of same-sex marriage were truly concerned with the equality, happiness, or wellbeing of same-sex couples, they would not try to refuse those people access to the same institutions and legal rights that they give themselves.\n \n\n First, no one is being denied the right to marry. Any man and any woman can get married. If gay-marriage was allowed, then any man would have the right to be \"gay married\" to any man, and the same for women.\n \n These points are, for the most part, trivial. The larger argument you still have not shown me:\n \n It cannot be denied that there are major economic (and other) incentives to getting married. You have stated several times that this is what gays fight for. You have also argued that a self-marriage would gain no economic incentives for the person under current law. Is it your belief that the law should promote one type of marriage but not the other? To do so is to say that your concept of love and marriage are better than mine. This is not equal treatment.\n \n At this point you will probably argue that the law treats everyone the same, it is just that I can't enjoy those benefits because of the way I fall into them (technically speaking). However, I could counter this by pointing out that the law treats everyone the same in terms of gay/straight marriage, as well, because any man can get married to any woman at any time and obtain those exact same benefits. You see, the argument that \"the current law, applied to everyone, treats everyone fairly\" cannot be applied one way and ignored the other.\n \n And to take it a step further, I can always argue that you are simply too bigoted to understand how it feels to experience a deep sense of love for yourself, that special joy where your heart skips a beat every time you look into the mirror. No. You cannot understand what it is like to be held down, to be given no incentives to marry one's self while others gain plenty. The country demonstrates unfair treatment by harboring laws written in such a way that do nothing for me, but so much for people with other concepts of marriage.",

LOL, LOL ! emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n At least we've kept one of it's fundamentals--we've kept it between a man and a woman.\n \n \n]That a person would feel their marriage \"demeaned\" or \"diluted\" because somewhere out there gay people are tying the knot says volumes about that person, and nothing about gays.\n\n \n It certainly does speak volumes--it speaks that that person cares about what marriage is and doesn't just view it as a gravy train from the govt. I have a lot more respect for anyone who cares enough about the institution of marriage to not want to see it broadened into meaninglessness than every little group that comes along demanding everybody change their view of the institution to fit their particular relationship arrangement.\n \n It's not \"their\" or \"my\" marriages that we're talking about by the way--but the institution of marriage. \n \n \nSame-sex marriage is an issue about anti-gay discrimination, not marriage.\n\n \n Most people that oppose you redefining marriage are doing it to protect the institution, not because they hate you. That's mostly been YOUR construct all along, though I'm sure the constant accusation works well in some cases to generate sympathy for your cause.\n \n \nGay people already have marriages. Whether or not straight people recognize it is irrelevent. The issue here is government recognition. And the refusal to recognize our relationships without some logical or at least legal justification is unconstitutional discrimination. Other people's sanctimonious outrage over the word is irrelevent, since their legal recognition is not affected in anyway.\n\n \n Bull--you know good and well the deeper reason for your movement is a push for validity and for society to accept homosexuality. People can see right through it. If govt. recognition were all you wanted, you wouldn't be so hung up over whether or not the benefits the govt. gives you is called marriage or not.\n \n Regarding those of you who seem to think this is an issue about the meaning of a 'word' changing, if it's just a word to you, it's funny that you seem so awfully concerned about it that you'd spend literally years of your lives lobbying for it. As you know, marriage is more than just a term or word. On one hand you all say it's about the benefits and govt. recognition, then when someone raises the idea of giving you the benefits you need and even legalizing it, you whine because it's not called a \"marriage.\" At least stop speaking out both sides of your mouth as a movement.\n \n \nYour marriage to yourself doesn't need legal recognition as it has no legal impact.\n\n \n It's obvious that the point he's making is that we're always going to be able to take the benefits of govt. and find someone or some group who's not getting them, and argue it's not fair. There certainly ARE some benefits that married people have that single people could benefit from. \n \n \nIf we invented marriage now on rational grounds, it would include gay marriage. It would not include the others you offer as they are meaningless legally in terms of property law etc.\n\n \n If you really want to make a discrimination-free form of marriage, you're going to have to find a way to make sure every possible relationship arrangement is covered--from incestous ones, to polygamous ones, to same-gender ones, etc. Oh and those people such as Zenodotus who point out that it's unfair that single people not get some of those benefits if they don't want to marry someone.",

   "In what way would our laws be teaching that a civil union is worse than a marriage, if both afforded the exact same legal rights? The law would not be teaching that one is better, only that they are different. And to argue that a women marrying a man and a man marrying a man are the same thing is purely incorrect from any logical standpoint (a square is not a circle). This makes it quite obvious, then, that gays are in fact arguing for the recognition that comes with the word \"marriage\" (that is associated with the straight populace, as they do not want people to associate them with their own lifestyles, which I personally find to be the most ironic and humorous part of all).\n\n \n Well, I can assure you that gay rights activists aren't worried about gays being associated with their own lifestyle. But there is indeed a difference in giving gay people \"civil unions\" and giving straight people \"marriage\". That difference is in what our laws would teach people.\n \n I don't mean to say that same-sex marriage isn't different from opposite-sex marriage. They are different in one and only one way: a same-sex marriage involves two people of the same sex instead of two people of the opposite-sex. Yet this difference in no way implies that we should create an entirely new set of rights to accomplish exactly the same thing. We have never done such a thing in the past, and doing such a thing could serve no purpose but to teach the people that those who engage in each institution are of different worth.\n \n Imagine if we create different names for the same right in other situations. What if we said, \"white people get the right to vote, but black people get the right of civil ballot-casting\", or even worse, what if we said, \"everyone gets the right of civil ballot-casting, but only white people get the right to vote\". Black people would be outraged at such a change to our laws, and rightfully so. Though you surely cannot deny that black people are different from white people in skin color, that difference doesn't mean we need to create a different set of rights for black people. What if we gave men \"freedom of speech\" and women \"civil words\"? What if we called Christianity a \"religion\" but Buddhism a \"civil belief\". By giving different groups of people rights by a different name, we are accomplishing nothing but teaching people that one group is not only different in specifics, but also of different worth.\n \n And I mean, think about it. Why do you want to keep marriage only for straight people? How do you justify denying people the same benefits you recieve unless they agree to take them by a different name? Don't you really believe that our laws teach people something. Perhaps, for example, you believe that allowing same-sex couples to engage in marriage will bring us closer to allowing marriage to accomodate \"bad\" relationships such as polygamy or incest or single-person marriage. But if that is the case, then you believe inherently that same-sex marriage is \"worse\" than opposite-sex marriage, that it is somehow closer to polygamy and incest and single-person marriage. In truth, it is not, and our law shouldn't be teaching people that it is.\n \n Now, I should also mention that even if civil unions have the same set of benefits under the law, there is no reason to believe that they would stay the same. Any legislature could grant additional benefits to marriage with as much ease as it takes to leave off the words \"and civil unions\". A governor could line item veto the benefits to civil unions on a bill passed by the legislature granting benefits to both marriage and civil unions. Seperate institutions will not retain the same legal rights.\n \n \nHere you are begging the question. The reason Christianity and Buddhism both have the protection of \"freedom of religion\" is because both are under the larger tenant of religion. As I stated above, gay marriage and marriage are not the same thing. To say that they should both fall under the tenant \"marriage\" assumes first that the definition of marriage ought to include both.\n\n \n I was not begging the question there because I was not attempting to prove that same-sex relationships fall under the category of \"marriage\", nor do I care whether they do. What I do care about is that we have two groups of people who both deserve the same benefits. When this is the case, we are morally wrong to grant one of those groups the same benefits under a different name. My analogy to religion showed that if we give the same benefits to two groups of people under different names, we have done something with the intention of promoting one of those groups above the next. The name of the institution given to both same-sex and opposite-sex couples is of no concern to me; I do not care whether it is an accurate description; it's just a name of the institution. Instead of marriage, call it \"candy canes\" if you want. I don't care whether \"candy canes\" accurately describes a couple; that is just the name of the institution, the name of those legal rights.\n \n \nFirst, no one is being denied the right to marry. Any man and any woman can get married. If gay-marriage was allowed, then any man would have the right to be \"gay married\" to any man, and the same for women.\n\n \n You're theoretically right about that, however this statement completely ignores the reality of the situation. In truth, straight people are the ones who are going to use the marriage we allow, while gay people are not. The restrictions we have created around marriage are designed in such a fashion that in order for a gay person to use it, he's got to stop being gay. If we legalized same-sex marriage, it would be the gay people who used that right, not the straight people. Although it is technically true that \"everyone is denied same-sex marriage\", the reality of the situation is that only gay people are denied it because they are the only ones who would ever actually use it. Gay people are the ones whom our laws are designed to prevent from marrying, and that's no secret to any of us here, so let's stop pretending the situation is something other than it is.\n \n \nThese points are, for the most part, trivial. The larger argument you still have not shown me:\n\n \n It makes sense that I haven't. This debate has up to this point been over whether or not your \"self-marriage\" is a valid argument against same-sex marriage. I believe I have provided adequate evidence that it is not. I can present my marriage argument as a whole, but I've already written a lot of words in this post, and I fear it will not be read thouroughly if I post it here. Maybe my next post or a new thread would suffice?\n \n \nIt cannot be denied that there are major economic (and other) incentives to getting married. You have stated several times that this is what gays fight for. You have also argued that a self-marriage would gain no economic incentives for the person under current law. Is it your belief that the law should promote one type of marriage but not the other? To do so is to say that your concept of love and marriage are better than mine. This is not equal treatment.\n\n \n The economic incentives of marriage are such that the combined taxes paid by two people could be less because of the number of dependants each person is allowed to claim. Also, by filing jointly, they can effectively behave as though their combined income is going to one person. I do not have any problem with allowing an individual to claim every dependant he has on his taxes, but if you are implying that he should be allowed to count his dependants twice or double his listed income on his tax statement, then I must disagree. The tax benefits of marriage are, I believe, intended to allow single-income families to allow the working parent to claim his or her spouse and that spouse's children as dependants; in most cases with two working parents, filing jointly pushes the family into a higher tax bracket and would not often be beneficial. If we could reasonably give any of these advantages to a single person, then I don't see why we wouldn't.\n \n \nAt this point you will probably argue that the law treats everyone the same, it is just that I can't enjoy those benefits because of the way I fall into them (technically speaking). However, I could counter this by pointing out that the law treats everyone the same in terms of gay/straight marriage, as well, because any man can get married to any woman at any time and obtain those exact same benefits. You see, the argument that \"the current law, applied to everyone, treats everyone fairly\" cannot be applied one way and ignored the other.\n\n \n You are incorrect. We should be giving single people as much benefits as makes sense to treat them and their lifestyle adequately. But that does not mean that we should not also allow anyone who wants it to add an unrelated person that they love as a new member of their family and allow the law to treat them as a family. Your argument against same-sex marriage is NOT \"it doesn't make rational sense to give same-sex couples the same benefits that I have\", it is \"if they want those benefits, they can just marry someone different\". And that does not accomodate their lifestyle nor their beliefs, and that is not fair. I do not ask a person who marries himself to \"marry someone else if he wants benefits\", I try to accomodate his lifestyle as best I can. But your solution to the same-sex marriage problem is \"we just won't give them the same benefits that we give ourselves, and if they want them, they can be like us\". That is unfair no matter how you cut it.\n \n \nAnd to take it a step further, I can always argue that you are simply too bigoted to understand how it feels to experience a deep sense of love for yourself, that special joy where your heart skips a beat every time you look into the mirror. No. You cannot understand what it is like to be held down, to be given no incentives to marry one's self while others gain plenty. The country demonstrates unfair treatment by harboring laws written in such a way that do nothing for me, but so much for people with other concepts of marriage.\n\n \n Well, you would be wrong to say that I am too bigoted to accept the beliefs and lifestyle of the person who marries himself, as I clearly believe we should treat such a lifestyle equally in every way possible. However, you could say that I am too ignorant, uneducated, unintelligent, or mistaken to have come to the conclusion that we are treating them as equally as possible. And that may very well be the case. If I have not made this clear in the past: I am sooner wrong about how we treat single people than I am wrong about same-sex marriage. So even if you were able to prove that we should allow single people to count their dependants twice (or what exactly is it you suggest we should do, anyway?), all you've done is reinforce the points and reasoning supporting same-sex marriage. You will have failed to shown any invalidity in the arguments supporting same-sex marriage.\n \n However, the above paragraph should not be interpreted to mean that I think your argument in support of granting additional benefits to a single person marrying himself is anything less than irrational.",

   "Yeah, they said that about gay marriages too.\n\n \n Cute ... emoticon_rolleyes \n \n Now tell us what is/was illogical about same-sex marriages, if you can.\n \n \n \n \n The point is, if you want marriage to be truly discrimination-free, then it's going to have to be changed to include every possible reason someone might come along wanting their partcular romantic arrangement to be called a marriage. Essentially you are saying \"polygamy is their problem, I just want gay marriage.\" But other times you all use the discrimination issue as an argument. \n\n \n \n No one is asking for \"discrimination free\" marriage (assuming you mean indiscriminate marriage). There has not been one single argument stated justifying marriages restricted to opposite sex couples.\n \n There are issues in regards to polygamous marriages, but they are not synonymous with what you feel would be the problems with same-sex marriages. If you think the two are related, you have yet to provide a correlation between the two. So simply saying that one would lead to the other is misleading, to say the least.\n \n And polygamy IS their problem. And while I am not totally against polygamous relationships, let them approach me with facts as to why it should be legal/recognized. But right now, right here, we are arguing about same-sex marriages. There have been no logical arguments against them. All you (and others) seem to have for arguments against same-sex marriages are a \"parade of horribles\" that you cannot link together in order to rationalize your position.\n \n You need to give it up.\n \n \nWell, marriage is natually discriminatory--if you want that to change then I would think you would be fighting for either an end to marriage benefits altogether or a means to extend to everyone regardless of their marriage (or lack of marriage) arrangement. Otherwise you really don't care about whether its discriminatory or not, as long as you get yours. \n \n \n Marriage isn't naturally anything.\n \n And discrimination per se is not unconstitutional. Discrimination is allowed provided that you provide a justifiable reason. If there is no justifiable reason for discrimination, then it is unconstitutional. There are legitimate issues with polygamy that justifies its lack of recognition (although I have heard from some that those issues can be resolved - I have yet to see them, however), such as primary next of kin status, child custody and a host of other issues, not to mention that many polygamous relationships involve intimidation and control issues, as well as misogyny.",

   "Gay relationships were once against the law too. \n \n Polygamy makes a good analogy for gay relationships because most of the same arguments for one can apply to the other.\n\n \n I agree that whether or not something is legal bears no indication on whether that thing is morally right or wrong.\n \n However, what I do not agree with is your statement that most of the same arguments for one can apply for the other. There are four primary points which support same-sex marriage, in my opinion. First, legalizing same-sex marriage increases equality. Second, legalizing same-sex marriage increases freedom. Third, harm to many people is removed by same-sex marriage, and no harm would come to any person because of it. Fourth, many people are benefited by same-sex marriage, and no one loses benefits.\n \n The only one of those arguments that can actually be used to support polygamous marriage is the argument that it increases freedom. It does not increase equality because people in polygamous relationships each have the ability to grant their benefits to a single other person in that relationship, and this provides precisely the same benefit to the members of that relationship as it does to the members of any other relationship. It does not elevate harm, as there is no harm to those in polygamous relationships, they have access to the same benefits in the same amount under the same name as anyone else. Although one might technically be able to say that some people are benefited by polygamous marriage and no on loses benefits, the reality of the situation is that those who do not engage in polygamous marriage would be harmed because of an increased tax rate to accomodate people who spread one individual's benefits across numerous people. This is different than same-sex marriage, for same-sex marriage allows same-sex couples to recieve an amount of tax benefit proportionate to the amount of taxes they pay. Without same-sex marriage, opposite-sex couples are paying less than their share because of same-sex couples who pay more taxes without seeing any benefits.\n \n Although supporters of polygamous marriage might try to use the same reasons for legalizing polygamous marriage that I use to support same-sex marriage, we are talking about two completely seperate situations, and the same logic simply does not apply. In fact, it doesn't even come close to applying; using the same logic I use to support same-sex marriage makes no sense at all when applied to polygamous marriage.",

   "At least we've kept one of it's fundamentals--we've kept it between a man and a woman.\n\n \n That's not necessarily the best thing.\n \n \nIt certainly does speak volumes--it speaks that that person cares about what marriage is and doesn't just view it as a gravy train from the govt. I have a lot more respect for anyone who cares enough about the institution of marriage to not want to see it broadened into meaninglessness than every little group that comes along demanding everybody change their view of the institution to fit their particular relationship arrangement.\n\n \n Every little goup? What is that supposed to mean<? Gay people are a part of our society. Changes are occurring, because society want it. \n \n \nIt's not \"their\" or \"my\" marriages that we're talking about by the way--but the institution of marriage.\n\n \n Yes.\n \n \nMost people that oppose you redefining marriage are doing it to protect the institution, not because they hate you.\n\n \n Protect it from what or from whom?\n \n \nBull--you know good and well the deeper reason for your movement is a push for validity and for society to accept homosexuality. People can see right through it. If govt. recognition were all you wanted, you wouldn't be so hung up over whether or not the benefits the govt. gives you is called marriage or not.\n\n \n Ah, people see right through the hidden, evil conspiracy, the shadowy evil froces who want someone being gay to be accepted. The reality is there is no hidden evil conspiracy, of course, these changes are occuring because people in society want the changes.\n \n \nRegarding those of you who seem to think this is an issue about the meaning of a 'word' changing, if it's just a word to you, it's funny that you seem so awfully concerned about it that you'd spend literally years of your lives lobbying for it. As you know, marriage is more than just a term or word. On one hand you all say it's about the benefits and govt. recognition, then when someone raises the idea of giving you the benefits you need and even legalizing it, you whine because it's not called a \"marriage.\" At least stop speaking out both sides of your mouth as a movement.\n\n \n Who are \"you all\"? We are a part of this society. Equal benefits are not equal recognition. \n \n \nIt's obvious that the point he's making is that we're always going to be able to take the benefits of govt. and find someone or some group who's not getting them, and argue it's not fair.\n\n \n Yes we can, and have in many instances. That doesn't address the issue of why gay people not getting those benefits and recognition is fair. \n \n \nIf you really want to make a discrimination-free form of marriage, you're going to have to find a way to make sure every possible relationship arrangement is covered--from incestous ones, to polygamous ones, to same-gender ones, etc. Oh and those people such as Zenodotus who point out that it's unfair that single people not get some of those benefits if they don't want to marry someone.\n\n \n That is a false dilemma logical fallacy. It's presenting only two black or white options, when in reality there are more than two. There are more than the two choices you suggest. We are not limited to either discriminate against same-sex marriage, or else allow any type of marriage.",

   "I don't mean to say that same-sex marriage isn't different from opposite-sex marriage. They are different in one and only one way: a same-sex marriage involves two people of the same sex instead of two people of the opposite-sex. Yet this difference in no way implies that we should create an entirely new set of rights to accomplish exactly the same thing.\n \n\n Why is this difference not great enough? It is a fundamental part of marriage.\n \n\n Imagine if we create different names for the same right in other situations. What if we said, \"white people get the right to vote, but black people get the right of civil ballot-casting\", or even worse, what if we said, \"everyone gets the right of civil ballot-casting, but only white people get the right to vote\". Black people would be outraged at such a change to our laws, and rightfully so. Though you surely cannot deny that black people are different from white people in skin color, that difference doesn't mean we need to create a different set of rights for black people. What if we gave men \"freedom of speech\" and women \"civil words\"? What if we called Christianity a \"religion\" but Buddhism a \"civil belief\". By giving different groups of people rights by a different name, we are accomplishing nothing but teaching people that one group is not only different in specifics, but also of different worth.\n \n\n Again, you beg the question. Black voters and white voters both fall under the label \"voters.\" Christianity and Buddhism both fall under the label \"religion.\" However, in order to compare these in a logical analogy to gay marriage and marriage, you first must prove that gay marriage and marriage should both fall under the word \"marriage.\" In order to do this, you must prove to me the question I ask above: how is the difference not fundamental?\n \n\n And I mean, think about it. Why do you want to keep marriage only for straight people? How do you justify denying people the same benefits you recieve unless they agree to take them by a different name? Don't you really believe that our laws teach people something. Perhaps, for example, you believe that allowing same-sex couples to engage in marriage will bring us closer to allowing marriage to accomodate \"bad\" relationships such as polygamy or incest or single-person marriage. But if that is the case, then you believe inherently that same-sex marriage is \"worse\" than opposite-sex marriage, that it is somehow closer to polygamy and incest and single-person marriage. In truth, it is not, and our law shouldn't be teaching people that it is.\n\n Why would I believe same-sex marriage is worse than hetero? I don't believe automobiles are the same thing as airplanes, but that doesn't mean I think they should have the same name.\n \n\n Now, I should also mention that even if civil unions have the same set of benefits under the law, there is no reason to believe that they would stay the same. Any legislature could grant additional benefits to marriage with as much ease as it takes to leave off the words \"and civil unions\". A governor could line item veto the benefits to civil unions on a bill passed by the legislature granting benefits to both marriage and civil unions. Seperate institutions will not retain the same legal rights.\n \n\n I think you know why this is a bad argument: it has nothing to do with the goal of this debate, which is to discover the truth about what the correct solution to our differences is. If the correct solution is more susceptible to change, then fixing that susceptibility is part of a different debate altogether.\n \n\n I was not begging the question there because I was not attempting to prove that same-sex relationships fall under the category of \"marriage\", nor do I care whether they do. What I do care about is that we have two groups of people who both deserve the same benefits. When this is the case, we are morally wrong to grant one of those groups the same benefits under a different name. My analogy to religion showed that if we give the same benefits to two groups of people under different names, we have done something with the intention of promoting one of those groups above the next. The name of the institution given to both same-sex and opposite-sex couples is of no concern to me; I do not care whether it is an accurate description; it's just a name of the institution. Instead of marriage, call it \"candy canes\" if you want. I don't care whether \"candy canes\" accurately describes a couple; that is just the name of the institution, the name of those legal rights.\n \n\n You talk a lot, but you still have not articulated why people would judge one institution \"better\" than the other, instead of simply judging them as being not the same thing.\n \n\n You're theoretically right about that, however this statement completely ignores the reality of the situation. In truth, straight people are the ones who are going to use the marriage we allow, while gay people are not. The restrictions we have created around marriage are designed in such a fashion that in order for a gay person to use it, he's got to stop being gay. If we legalized same-sex marriage, it would be the gay people who used that right, not the straight people. Although it is technically true that \"everyone is denied same-sex marriage\", the reality of the situation is that only gay people are denied it because they are the only ones who would ever actually use it.\n \n\n So tell me this: what if there is some person or number of people in this country who would feel that their marriage has been incredibly devalued and bastardized by the use of the word \"marriage\" to define gay marriages. Isn't this an infringement of their rights? I know what you are going to say: they should know the value of their marriage, and only they can determine that, and should not care what other people think etc etc. Ok, got it. So what if murder was legalized tomorrow? Clearly the only people who would benefit from this legalization would be murderers. And if they ran around killing people? Well, I don't think the people killed should really care. They should know the value of their life, and it shouldn't really matter to them what people think about it, whether they are dead or alive. As long as they believe their lives still have equal worth, then no harm has really been done. Right? Or what if theft was legalized? The only people to benefit would be thieves. So if they started taking everyone's things, the people losing their things shouldn't really care, because after all if my stuff got taken from me, I would still know the value of myself. Deep down I would know that the stuff was still really mine. And I would know silly things like stuff has nothing to do with anything, its just what I think in my head.\n \n Now you are probably thinking: but it's like when blacks got the right to vote! I could argue the \"devalue\" argument about that (and other things), too! But you can't. Why? Because when blacks, for example, gained the right to vote, the definition of the word \"vote\" did not have to change with it. Hence if a white was to determine what he was doing when \"voting\" from a strictly definitive standpoint before the change was made, and then again after, he would find no difference. So there was no value change (increase, decrease, or just plain different) in his \"voting\" because his \"voting\" was the exact same.\n \n\n You are incorrect. We should be giving single people as much benefits as makes sense to treat them and their lifestyle adequately. But that does not mean that we should not also allow anyone who wants it to add an unrelated person that they love as a new member of their family and allow the law to treat them as a family. Your argument against same-sex marriage is NOT \"it doesn't make rational sense to give same-sex couples the same benefits that I have\", it is \"if they want those benefits, they can just marry someone different\". And that does not accomodate their lifestyle nor their beliefs, and that is not fair. I do not ask a person who marries himself to \"marry someone else if he wants benefits\", I try to accomodate his lifestyle as best I can. But your solution to the same-sex marriage problem is \"we just won't give them the same benefits that we give ourselves, and if they want them, they can be like us\". That is unfair no matter how you cut it.\n \n\n But the lifestyle of the self-married is very difficult. You don't understand how emotionally stressful it is to have your spouse agree with you about every little thing, to never be willing to go get anything for you or do you a favor unless you are right there with them... I mean the sex is great, and I really love myself, I really do, but you just don't understand how difficult it can be. So, because I have been challenged with this love I have for myself, I believe I should be accommodated with a sum of money that will help to bring my quality of life up to the same level as a married person. I know you can't understand how hard it is, being self-married, totally and uncontrollably in love with yourself, but trust me it's a very tough life. And it's genetic, I didn't choose to be in love with myself, so I really should to be accommodated with monetary benefits.",

Maybe you don't like this, maybe you do. You don't seem to want to participate in a logical debate on gay rights, however want to create a diversion.

   "Why is this difference not great enough? It is a fundamental part of marriage.\n\n \n We do not give people who behave, believe, or live different a different set of rights under the law, and the requirement that marriage be between two individuals of the opposite-sex should not be a fundamental part of marriage. There is absolutely no reason for it to be except to deny same-sex couples access to marriage, which we have no reason to do. Opposite-sexes is a fundamental part of marriage, but my argument is that we should change that fundamental part of marriage because doing so doesn't affect most people, but helps a few dramatically, because doing so promotes equality by removing a restriction on marriage, because doing so promotes freedom. Simply saying \"we shouldn't give women the right to vote because being male is a fundamental part of being a voter\" does not mean that this fundamental part of being a voter isn't morally evil.\n \n \nAgain, you beg the question. Black voters and white voters both fall under the label \"voters.\" Christianity and Buddhism both fall under the label \"religion.\" However, in order to compare these in a logical analogy to gay marriage and marriage, you first must prove that gay marriage and marriage should both fall under the word \"marriage.\" In order to do this, you must prove to me the question I ask above: how is the difference not fundamental?\n\n \n Black and white voters both fall under the label \"voters\" today. Christianity and Buddhism both fall under the label \"religion\" today. But you are forgetting a time when there were only white, male voters and you are forgetting a time when there was only one religion. And one could certainly argue that there are fundamental differences between males and females or Christianity and Buddhism. But it does not matter whether there are fundamental differences; we should not give each religion a different set of rights under the law, and we should not give men and women a different set of rights under the law. If you are looking for me to explain how the difference between same-sex and opposite-sex relationships is not fundamental, look somewhere else because that's a matter of opinion. What is not a matter of opinion is that we have no reason to deny same-sex couples the same rights that opposite-sex couples give themselves, despite any differences, and to do so is morally wrong. If we can give people the same rights, we should.\n \n \nWhy would I believe same-sex marriage is worse than hetero? I don't believe automobiles are the same thing as airplanes, but that doesn't mean I think they should have the same name.\n\n \n Yet we aren't debating a name here, and that is where I think you are failing to understand what you are arguing in support of. We are debating access to a legal institution. The name of that legal institution can be whatever you want it to be, no gay rights activist would care if you changed the name. As I have tried to say in the past, the name of a legal institution doesn't always accurately represent the meaning of that word. For example, \"welfare\" is a legal institution, but it has nothing to do with the definition of the word \"welfare\".\n \n When I say, \"marriage\", I'm talking about a legal institution. When you say it above, it sounds like you're talking about just a word. Or am I wrong? If so, perhaps you could agree that we shouldn't give rich people access to \"Welfare\" and instead create a different institution that does the same thing called \"Civil Money-Granting\" because really, rich people don't need that money so we shouldn't call it \"Welfare\" for them. The mere suggestion is of course absurdity, yet it still makes a lot more sense than saying that we should give same-sex couples access to a different legal institution than opposite-sex couples because \"marriage doesn't mean same-sex\" (which might not be true depending on your beliefs).\n \n As for why you would consider same-sex marriage worse than hetero, well it is my guess that you already do and that your beliefs on the subject would not change. If you did not, I do not see why you would hold any objection at all to giving same-sex couples the same rights you have. Why do you object giving them those same rights? Why must your rights be different? I can think of no reason except to promote your own superiority. These questions have not been answered.\n \n \nI think you know why this is a bad argument: it has nothing to do with the goal of this debate, which is to discover the truth about what the correct solution to our differences is. If the correct solution is more susceptible to change, then fixing that susceptibility is part of a different debate altogether.\n\n \n It is true that you could indeed fix that susceptibility by making it unconstitutional on a federal level to treat the legal institution of marriage differently than the legal institution of civil unions, yet this problem has been handled in every case in the past by giving everyone the same rights, not by creating a different set of rights for some people. The real intent of what I wrote was to reinforce the point that we are talking about creating two seperate legal institutions which do exactly the same thing for the sole purpose of, as far as I can tell, keeping gay people out of straight people's rights. \n \n \nYou talk a lot, but you still have not articulated why people would judge one institution \"better\" than the other, instead of simply judging them as being not the same thing.\n\n \n If I had not made it clear, let me attempt to do so now. We do not give two different groups of people a different set of rights that accomplish the same thing under the law in any other situation ever; there are no exceptions. We give black people exactly the same rights as white people in every situation, yet you have no trouble distinguishing between the two. We give Christians exactly the same rights as Buddhists in every situation, yet you have no trouble distinguishing between the two. I can say the same thing about men and women, blondes and brunettes, orange-juice-drinkers and milk-drinkers, home owners and apartment owners, etc. Yet you have no trouble understanding that any of those groups of people are not the same thing. \n \n So what does it mean when we do give different groups of people different rights to accomplish the same thing? It promotes the idea that they are different, yes, but it promotes the idea that they are completely different. Because marriage is a union based on love, commitment, and raising a family (among other things), creating two different legal institutions promotes the idea that same-sex couples don't love the same way, don't have the same commitment, and don't raise a family in the same fashion as opposite-sex couples. That simply isn't true, and our laws shouldn't be making that distinction even if it were. When our laws make that sort of judgement, when our laws state that one group is different than other, it is always the minority who is harmed. In this case, the majority will see their own relationships as superior, they will believe that their love is more true, their commitment greater, and their families raised better than same-sex couples. They will see opposite-couples do immoral things and classify them as an exception, and they will see same-sex couples do immoral things and generalize it across all same-sex couples. All of the standard majority/minority problems will be perpetuated, because our laws are teaching people that there is more difference between same-sex and opposite-sex couples than just the sex of those involved.\n \n Surely you know that marriage has a meaning in our society. If we give same-sex couples civil unions, then civil unions will have a meaning too, and civil unions will never be judged equal to marriage on a moral or social level because those who engage in civil unions will be the minority. If we called them something different than \"marriage\" and \"civil unions\", then the majority institution would again be thought of more highly. The minority would not have an equal chance to promote their own beliefs, to prove their own worth.\n \n I think opponents of same-sex marriage tend to not want same-sex marriage to be seen as an equal to opposite-sex marriage, they want to assure that opposite-sex marriage does not lose what makes it \"special\". They want to say, \"We will give everyone equal rights, even the ones we don't approve of\", but by instituting civil unions, we're specifically pointing out which relationships we don't approve of and putting that disapproval into law. Making opposite-sex marriage \"special\" is nothing more than elevating your own religion, beliefs, and lifestyle over everyone else's; I think this is the most difficult thing for opponents of same-sex marriage to understand: our law must give all relationships the same rights and let the people decide which ones are the best, which ones are special, for themselves. If we use the law to decide which relationships, which beliefs, or which lifestyles are special, then we're put an end to freedom and equality.\n \n You're right, having both marriage and civil unions just make people judge same-sex relationships and opposite-sex relationships as not the same thing. But that is exactly why it is so harmful.\n \n \nSo tell me this: what if there is some person or number of people in this country who would feel that their marriage has been incredibly devalued and bastardized by the use of the word \"marriage\" to define gay marriages. Isn't this an infringement of their rights? I know what you are going to say: they should know the value of their marriage, and only they can determine that, and should not care what other people think etc etc. Ok, got it.\n\n \n I'm not going to be saying that peolpe should be doing anything. If an individual feels that his marriage is devalued by giving someone access to the same rights that he has, then he is free to feel that way. But that does not make it morally okay to strip the rights of other people to accomodate people who are discomforted at the thought of people having the same rights.\n \n In direct answer to your question, no it is not an infringement of someone's rights to do something which makes them unhappy. A right is something that a person is able to do, and a political right is something which the law allows someone to do. Government will take away some of our rights, such as the right to murder other people, but it does that in hopes of protecting most of our rights. Keeping this in mind, you should understand that by doing something which makes a person feel bad, we are not infringing on anyone's rights. That person who feels bad is still able to do all of the things he was able to do in the past, and he is still allowed to interpret them as he sees fit.\n \n Now don't get me wrong: I'd sure hate to devalue someone's marriage, and I'm sure someone people will think their marriage is devalued. In the same fashion, I'm sure that if I gave white people special marriage rights under the law and taught everyone that white people are superior, they would come to see their own marriages as more special than everyone else's. This would happen because I've elevated them above everyone else. Then when I tried to restore equality, those white people would start to see their relationships as devalued. How could they not? Their relationships had been placed on a pedastal above everyone else for hundreds of years. But by restoring equality to everyone, I am doing the right thing. Even though whites might be the majority, we are morally wrong to elevate them above everyone else, and when we realize this problem, we've got to restore equality, even if that means hurting some feelings. I am sorry to those who feel their marriage is devalued by allowing same-sex couples to marry, but they are no more justified in denying marriage to same-sex couples than a white person would be in denying marriage to black couples, even if it hurt that white person's feelings.\n \n \nSo what if murder was legalized tomorrow? Clearly the only people who would benefit from this legalization would be murderers. And if they ran around killing people? Well, I don't think the people killed should really care. They should know the value of their life, and it shouldn't really matter to them what people think about it, whether they are dead or alive. As long as they believe their lives still have equal worth, then no harm has really been done. Right? Or what if theft was legalized? The only people to benefit would be thieves. So if they started taking everyone's things, the people losing their things shouldn't really care, because after all if my stuff got taken from me, I would still know the value of myself. Deep down I would know that the stuff was still really mine. And I would know silly things like stuff has nothing to do with anything, its just what I think in my head.\n\n \n This paragraph isn't relevant since my above paragraph pointed out that you have the wrong idea about what I would say. Still, murder is a situation in which one person willingly takes away the rights of another person. In this case, we are not talking about a person who is making people feel less special by exercising his freedom, we are talking about a situation in which the murderer is physically harming the victim, and who is preventing that victim from exercising freedoms. There is harm caused by murder. \n \n \nNow you are probably thinking: but it's like when blacks got the right to vote! I could argue the \"devalue\" argument about that (and other things), too! But you can't. Why? Because when blacks, for example, gained the right to vote, the definition of the word \"vote\" did not have to change with it. Hence if a white was to determine what he was doing when \"voting\" from a strictly definitive standpoint before the change was made, and then again after, he would find no difference. So there was no value change (increase, decrease, or just plain different) in his \"voting\" because his \"voting\" was the exact same.\n\n \n The definition of the word \"vote\" did not have to change, but the definition of the word \"voter\" did. There is no reason to believe that any definition of a word that we use is a moral definition, and we're not talking about words here anyway, we're talking about legal institutions.\n \n But I think you have said exactly what my point is: \"Hence if a heterosexual was to determine what he was doing when \"marrying\" from a strictly definitive standpoint before the change was made, and then again after, he would find no difference. So there was no value change (increase, decrease, or just plain different) in his \"marrying\" because his \"marrying\" was the exact same.\" Although a heterosexual might \"feel\" that his marriage is changed or of lesser value, same-sex marriage will in fact bring no change in any shape or form to heterosexual marriage. In the same manner, a white person might \"feel\" that his vote is of lesser value, but allowing blacks to be called \"voters\" brought no change to white votes. Actually, white people would have more justification to claim that they are being harmed by allowing blacks to vote because the white person's vote would now be forced to compete against more people's votes. Yet even that does not change the fact that everyone deserves the same legal rights.\n \n \nBut the lifestyle of the self-married is very difficult. You don't understand how emotionally stressful it is to have your spouse agree with you about every little thing, to never be willing to go get anything for you or do you a favor unless you are right there with them... I mean the sex is great, and I really love myself, I really do, but you just don't understand how difficult it can be. So, because I have been challenged with this love I have for myself, I believe I should be accommodated with a sum of money that will help to bring my quality of life up to the same level as a married person. I know you can't understand how hard it is, being self-married, totally and uncontrollably in love with yourself, but trust me it's a very tough life. And it's genetic, I didn't choose to be in love with myself, so I really should to be accommodated with monetary benefits.\n\n \n You are not showing any correlation between my arguments and the arguments of a person who wishes to marry himself. It matters neither whether you choose to be in love with yourself, nor whether your relationship is emotionally stressful, just as it does not matter whether homosexuality is a choice nor whether it is emotionally stressful. The person who marries himself deserves the same treatment as anyone else, and that means he should not recieve a sum of money which is not granted to anyone else.",

   "The comparison of gay marriage to voting is tenuous when one realizes that voting has been a constitutional gurantee specifically stated from early on. Yet I would challenge anyone here to find in the constitution where marriage benefits are even mentioned.\n\n \n First, I brought up voting in an attempt to determine the morality of same-sex marriage, not the possiblity that the Constitution guarantees same-sex marriage. Second, remember that the right to vote was not a Constitutional guarantee until an ammendment was passed making it one. The fact that voting is currently a Constitutional guarantee today is irrelevant.\n \n \n- The constitution specifically points out voting as a right, but never specifically points out marriage. The constitution never specifically states marriage as a right the way it does voting. IOW, there is FAR more constitutional backing for voting than there ever has been for marriage benefits from the govt.\n\n \n This is irrelevant as explained above.\n \n \n- The debate over gay marriage is really a debate over benefits that married people have over single people. As we've discussed before, marriage benefits were not around (or at least were very limited) when the constitution was written. Voting however, is not a benefit (like marriage benefits) but a right specifically allowed by the constitution such as freedom of press or freedom to own property. Comparing marriage benefits from the govt. to these constitutionally-specified bedrocks of rights is a poor analogy.\n\n \n Voting is a benefit granted to the people in the same way that marriage does. Simply because one is Constitutionally backed does not make one a benefit and the other a right. They are both benefits, and they are both rights. As it happens, we are guaranteed the right to vote by the Constitution, and we are not guaranteed the right to marry by the Constitution. To say that marriage is a benefit, a privledge is true, but the same is true of voting. My argument does not deny this, it simply says that same-sex couples should have access to the same benefits and privledges as opposite-sex couples. Again, opposite-sex couples should not be elevating themselves above anyone else with exclusive legal benefits.\n \n \n- Also, every group that has been given voting rights were given those rights by constitutional amendment, not by the judiciary. Yet no amendment is on the table to guarantee marriage benefits as a right, either to straights or gays. If gay people want it to be guaranteed that marriage can be defined to include them, they need to be trying to get an amendment through, the way civil rights issues such as these have been historically handled.\n\n \n The means by which same-sex marriage should best be achieved does not affect its morality. I would love for there to be an ammendment which mandates that states do not deny rights based on sexual orientation (or religion or beliefs or race or ethnicity or gender or gender identity, etc). I do feel this is covered by the 14th Ammendment, but our nation has taken the very dangerous viewpoint that if a right isn't specifically protected by name, the government should be allowed to deny it, which was not at all the intent of our founders. Anyhow, granting same-sex couples the same rights as opposite-sex couples is the only moral solution. The means by which we reach that solution are not important.

   "We do not give people who behave, believe, or live different a different set of rights under the law, and the requirement that marriage be between two individuals of the opposite-sex should not be a fundamental part of marriage. There is absolutely no reason for it to be except to deny same-sex couples access to marriage, which we have no reason to do. Opposite-sexes is a fundamental part of marriage, but my argument is that we should change that fundamental part of marriage because doing so doesn't affect most people, but helps a few dramatically, because doing so promotes equality by removing a restriction on marriage, because doing so promotes freedom. Simply saying \"we shouldn't give women the right to vote because being male is a fundamental part of being a voter\" does not mean that this fundamental part of being a voter isn't morally evil.\n \n\n Changing these fundamental parts of marriage does affect most people; in fact it affects every person who is married. You do not seem to understand that the law should not have the power to redefine words, specifically those it did no create. \"Marriage\" is an idea created not by the political minds of our country, but by religious leaders over time. Should we be able to make a law saying that confession shall be administered by anyone? That a bar mitzvah shall be the coming of age that occurs at 16? That a last rite is something that shall be administered two days after death?\n \n\n Black and white voters both fall under the label \"voters\" today. Christianity and Buddhism both fall under the label \"religion\" today. But you are forgetting a time when there were only white, male voters and you are forgetting a time when there was only one religion. And one could certainly argue that there are fundamental differences between males and females or Christianity and Buddhism. But it does not matter whether there are fundamental differences; we should not give each religion a different set of rights under the law, and we should not give men and women a different set of rights under the law.\n \n\n The only way to make this analogy fit is to say: what does one do to become married? Well, let's apply this to voting. What does one do to become a voter? One places a vote. So, even if voting were illegal for blacks, if he placed a vote, he would still be a voter. He would be breaking the law, but he would still be a voter. What about marriage? Well, to become married, one weds a member of the opposite sex. If one weds a member of the same sex, one is not married. Understand the question-begging yet?\n \n\n Yet we aren't debating a name here, and that is where I think you are failing to understand what you are arguing in support of. We are debating access to a legal institution.\n \n\n Wrong. We are debating the power of the government to redefine words and institutions it did not create.\n \n\n If I had not made it clear, let me attempt to do so now. We do not give two different groups of people a different set of rights that accomplish the same thing under the law in any other situation ever; there are no exceptions. We give black people exactly the same rights as white people in every situation, yet you have no trouble distinguishing between the two. We give Christians exactly the same rights as Buddhists in every situation, yet you have no trouble distinguishing between the two. I can say the same thing about men and women, blondes and brunettes, orange-juice-drinkers and milk-drinkers, home owners and apartment owners, etc. Yet you have no trouble understanding that any of those groups of people are not the same thing. \n \n\n And oddly enough, in making these religious institutions equal under the law, we did not have to redefine any of their central tenants.\n \n\n So what does it mean when we do give different groups of people different rights to accomplish the same thing? It promotes the idea that they are different, yes, but it promotes the idea that they are completely different.\n \n\n Wrong. It promotes the idea that they are different, yes, but it also promotes the idea that central tenants of a religious faith are not subject to government redefinition.\n \n\n Surely you know that marriage has a meaning in our society. If we give same-sex couples civil unions, then civil unions will have a meaning too, and civil unions will never be judged equal to marriage on a moral or social level because those who engage in civil unions will be the minority. If we called them something different than \"marriage\" and \"civil unions\", then the majority institution would again be thought of more highly. The minority would not have an equal chance to promote their own beliefs, to prove their own worth.\n \n\n To promote their own beliefs? I was under the impression that the \"belief\" of homosexuality was genetic, not a decision. Is there some hidden agenda I was not aware of? And it's funny how gays always mock the institution of marriage, with its high divorce rates etc etc. You can see these comments made several times on this thread already. It doesn't seem to me that many gays hold it with much meaning. If gays are so much more committed, why not create civil unions and let them prove that they are more committed with lower divorce rates, less cheating, etc.? Then maybe civil unions would become the \"hip\" thing and marriage would become a minority. emoticon_wow \n \n But along with the genetic line of thought. You argue that our laws never differentiate between people, that they always treat everyone the same. Well, what about those born mentally retarded? They receive certain disability benefits that the majority does not. They go through different educational systems, have different transportation needs, parking spaces, et. al. If homosexuality is genetic, what is the problem with creating laws that treat these people similarly to those born with a disability? I don't believe that a mentally retarded person is any worse than me, but I do believe that they have special needs and that the law treats them differently than me for a reason. Likewise, why would I believe a gay person is worse than me? I don't have to believe that to understand that they need their own special systems. Civil unions are one such system that they can use to help fulfill their need for commitment.\n \n \n\n In direct answer to your question, no it is not an infringement of someone's rights to do something which makes them unhappy. A right is something that a person is able to do, and a political right is something which the law allows someone to do. Government will take away some of our rights, such as the right to murder other people, but it does that in hopes of protecting most of our rights. Keeping this in mind, you should understand that by doing something which makes a person feel bad, we are not infringing on anyone's rights. That person who feels bad is still able to do all of the things he was able to do in the past, and he is still allowed to interpret them as he sees fit.\n \n\n You do not understand: his rights are being infringed because the government is redefining a central tenant of his religious beliefs for him.\n \n\n Now don't get me wrong: I'd sure hate to devalue someone's marriage, and I'm sure someone people will think their marriage is devalued. In the same fashion, I'm sure that if I gave white people special marriage rights under the law and taught everyone that white people are superior, they would come to see their own marriages as more special than everyone else's. This would happen because I've elevated them above everyone else. Then when I tried to restore equality, those white people would start to see their relationships as devalued. How could they not? Their relationships had been placed on a pedastal above everyone else for hundreds of years. But by restoring equality to everyone, I am doing the right thing. Even though whites might be the majority, we are morally wrong to elevate them above everyone else, and when we realize this problem, we've got to restore equality, even if that means hurting some feelings. I am sorry to those who feel their marriage is devalued by allowing same-sex couples to marry, but they are no more justified in denying marriage to same-sex couples than a white person would be in denying marriage to black couples, even if it hurt that white person's feelings.\n \n\n This is more question begging...hopefully you understand this by now...\n \n\n The definition of the word \"vote\" did not have to change, but the definition of the word \"voter\" did. There is no reason to believe that any definition of a word that we use is a moral definition, and we're not talking about words here anyway, we're talking about legal institutions.\n \n But I think you have said exactly what my point is: \"Hence if a heterosexual was to determine what he was doing when \"marrying\" from a strictly definitive standpoint before the change was made, and then again after, he would find no difference.

If he were now to look up the definition of what he had just done, \"marriage,\" he would find that he had married a \"person,\" and not a \"woman.\" The change is undeniable.\n \n \n\n You are not showing any correlation between my arguments and the arguments of a person who wishes to marry himself. It matters neither whether you choose to be in love with yourself, nor whether your relationship is emotionally stressful, just as it does not matter whether homosexuality is a choice nor whether it is emotionally stressful. The person who marries himself deserves the same treatment as anyone else, and that means he should not recieve a sum of money which is not granted to anyone else.\n\n \n You said:\n \"We should be giving single people as much benefits as makes sense to treat them and their lifestyle adequately....your solution to the same-sex marriage problem is \"we just won't give them the same benefits that we give ourselves, and if they want them, they can be like us\". That is unfair no matter how you cut it.\"\n \n I said: \"But the lifestyle of the self-married is very difficult. You don't understand how emotionally stressful it is to have your spouse agree with you about every little thing, to never be willing to go get anything for you or do you a favor unless you are right there with them... I mean the sex is great, and I really love myself, I really do, but you just don't understand how difficult it can be. So, because I have been challenged with this love I have for myself, I believe I should be accommodated with a sum of money that will help to bring my quality of life up to the same level as a married person. I know you can't understand how hard it is, being self-married, totally and uncontrollably in love with yourself, but trust me it's a very tough life. And it's genetic, I didn't choose to be in love with myself, so I really should to be accommodated with monetary benefits.\"\n \n So, my argument was that the lifestyle of the self-married is very difficult, so it \"makes sense\" to give them \"adequate\" benefits. Just like we spend more tax dollars on the handicapped than we do those who are not, we ought to spend more money on those who are in love with themselves. Their problem is genetic, too, so they can't help it. And your last statement: \"your solution to the same-sex marriage problem is \"we just won't give them the same benefits that we give ourselves, and if they want them, they can be like us\". That is unfair no matter how you cut it.\" This supports this theory, after all you accept that self-married cannot obtain the benefits of marriage, so by your logic, expecting them to \"be like us\" if they want the benefits, is \"unfair no matter how you cut it.\"",

   "Changing these fundamental parts of marriage does affect most people; in fact it affects every person who is married. You do not seem to understand that the law should not have the power to redefine words, specifically those it did no create. \"Marriage\" is an idea created not by the political minds of our country, but by religious leaders over time.\n\n \n No, marriage doesn't exist without government involvement. It is not just religious. Certain religions, the religions which don't perform and recognize gay marriages, do not have sole ownership of that word.\n \n \nThe only way to make this analogy fit is to say: what does one do to become married? Well, let's apply this to voting. What does one do to become a voter? One places a vote. So, even if voting were illegal for blacks, if he placed a vote, he would still be a voter. He would be breaking the law, but he would still be a voter. What about marriage? Well, to become married, one weds a member of the opposite sex. If one weds a member of the same sex, one is not married. Understand the question-begging yet?\n\n \n Yes that person is married. It is just not legally recognized, where it is not legally recognized.\n \n \nWrong. We are debating the power of the government to redefine words and institutions it did not create.\n\n \n So who created it? Was it only the Catholics? The Protestants? The Unitarians? The United Church of Canada?\n \n \nWrong. It promotes the idea that they are different, yes, but it also promotes the idea that central tenants of a religious faith are not subject to government redefinition.\n\n \n Nonsense. No one is doing that. Religious freedom is important to both sides of this debate.\n \n \nTo promote their own beliefs? I was under the impression that the \"belief\" of homosexuality was genetic, not a decision. Is there some hidden agenda I was not aware of?\n\n \n Yep. The agenda is equality. It doesn't matter if it is genetic or not. Something can be non-genetic, and still not be a conscious decision. \n \n \nAnd it's funny how gays always mock the institution of marriage, with its high divorce rates etc etc. You can see these comments made several times on this thread already. It doesn't seem to me that many gays hold it with much meaning.\n\n \n Just objecting to the nonsense that we, as gays, as partners of the same sex, are such a threat to it. Divorce would seem to be the greatest threat.\n \n \nIf gays are so much more committed, why not create civil unions and let them prove that they are more committed with lower divorce rates, less cheating, etc.? Then maybe civil unions would become the \"hip\" thing and marriage would become a minority. emoticon_wow\n\n \n Then the straight people would want civil unions and not marriage. Especially if civil unions or other arrangements become so similar to marriage. These would have to be extended to straight people too. That would seem to be the bigger threat to marriage, than allowing gay people into the instiution. \n \n \nBut along with the genetic line of thought. You argue that our laws never differentiate between people, that they always treat everyone the same. Well, what about those born mentally retarded? They receive certain disability benefits that the majority does not. They go through different educational systems, have different transportation needs, parking spaces, et. al.\n\n \n That's because they have different needs.\n \n \nIf homosexuality is genetic, what is the problem with creating laws that treat these people similarly to those born with a disability?\n\n \n This isn't about genes. Being gay is not to be disabled. There is no disability that would prevent them from performing in the institution of marriage, the same way heterosexuals perfomr in it.\n \n \nI don't believe that a mentally retarded person is any worse than me, but I do believe that they have special needs and that the law treats them differently than me for a reason. Likewise, why would I believe a gay person is worse than me? I don't have to believe that to understand that they need their own special systems. Civil unions are one such system that they can use to help fulfill their need for commitment.\n\n \n Now, you have to convince us that gay people need a special system.\n \n \nYou do not understand: his rights are being infringed because the government is redefining a central tenant of his religious beliefs for him.\n\n \n His religion can define marriage how it wishes. How about gay positive religions who want to marry same-sex couples? Why should they have their beliefs re-defined to not allow same-sex marriage?\n \n \nYes, his heterosexual marriage has changed in more than just a feeling. If he were now to look up the definition of what he had just done, \"marriage,\" he would find that he had married a \"person,\" and not a \"woman.\" The change is undeniable.\n\n \n Straight people are marrying a person too.\n \n \nSo, my argument was that the lifestyle of the self-married is very difficult, so it \"makes sense\" to give them \"adequate\" benefits. Just like we spend more tax dollars on the handicapped than we do those who are not, we ought to spend more money on those who are in love with themselves. Their problem is genetic, too, so they can't help it.\n\n \n You want money spent on those who love themselves? More money? Not an equal amount of money to gay or straight married couples? You are saying loving yourself is a \"problem\"? Maybe you should look into some type of therapy for it, just as the disabled get help.\n \n \nAnd your last statement: \"your solution to the same-sex marriage problem is \"we just won't give them the same benefits that we give ourselves, and if they want them, they can be like us\".

It may be unfair that you can't get benefits for loving yourself, or just can't get benefits, period. However, this is a whole other debate. It doesn't mean we shouldn't or won't give benefits to same-sex couples or to different-sex couples, or to other types of couples.",

   "No, marriage doesn't exist without government involvement. It is not just religious. Certain religions, the religions which don't perform and recognize gay marriages, do not have sole ownership of that word.\n\n \n Marriage, religious or simply cultural, has been around a lot longer than govt. recognition of marriage. Marriage is between two people, and the govt. recognizes it. The idea that there is a govt. institution called marriage is simply absurd--all the govt.'s role amounts to is a recognition of what's there, and using it as a criteria to give some benefits. And marriage outside of the govt.'s role is not only \"religious;\" I'm sure there have been many couples in history that have gotten married who weren't religious and didn't have a religious-styled ceremony, yet who also didn't have govt. recognition of their marriage. \n \n \nThis isn't about genes. Being gay is not to be disabled. There is no disability that would prevent them from performing in the institution of marriage, the same way heterosexuals perfomr in it.\n\n \n But you don't \"perform in it\" the same way as heterosexuals--heterosexuals carry on opposite-sex relationships. From the governmental standpoint, disability as well as social security is a good example, because they are both cases where the govt. uses certain criteria to give benefits to certain people. Marriage is also such a case.\n \n \nYep. The agenda is equality. It doesn't matter if it is genetic or not. Something can be non-genetic, and still not be a conscious decision.\n\n \n The agenda of the gay pride movement is to uiltimately gain validity for homosexuality--not so much recognition of marriage. That is blatantly obvious.\n \n \n \nJust objecting to the nonsense that we, as gays, as partners of the same sex, are such a threat to it. Divorce would seem to be the greatest threat.\n\n \n Divorce is indeed a threat, as are many things. I think you'll find many conservatives who don't like divorce as well.\n \n \nWhy would you need couples benefits if you are just one person? It may be unfair that you can't get benefits for loving yourself, or just can't get benefits, period. However, this is a whole other debate. It doesn't mean we shouldn't or won't give benefits to same-sex couples or to different-sex couples, or to other types of couples.\n\n \n Maybe he's a person who want's the couple's benefits with someone else but doesn't want to get married to do it. EIther way, they could make the same arguments you are making. You are not arguing for equality at all, but simply for gays to have marriage benefits too (which is really just a push for validity for homosexuality by your movement). If you were truly arguing for EQUALITY in marriage benenfits, you would have to redefine marriage to include every possibly arrangement anyone could ever bring to the table--same-sex marriage included.\n \n \nAh, but it's legal recognition is something dreamed up by our founding fathers.\n\n \n Err . . . no. The govt. didn't grant marriage benefits in the late 1700s. In fact marriage was still quite a patriarchal matter at that time. If the founding fathers had \"dreamed up\" legal recogntion for marriage, they would have made it so, but they didn't. Since they didn't, we don't know WHAT they dreamed up other than what was put in place.",

   "Changing these fundamental parts of marriage does affect most people; in fact it affects every person who is married. You do not seem to understand that the law should not have the power to redefine words, specifically those it did no create. \"Marriage\" is an idea created not by the political minds of our country, but by religious leaders over time. Should we be able to make a law saying that confession shall be administered by anyone? That a bar mitzvah shall be the coming of age that occurs at 16? That a last rite is something that shall be administered two days after death?\n\n \n Marriage lost its right to be called an only-religious institution when it was placed into law. As soon as that happens, it must be granted equally to all men and women. Instead of legally making the bar mitzvah a coming of age that occurs at 16, the bar mitzvah shouldn't be in our law in the first place. Now that marriage is in our laws, in the name of equality and freedom it must either be granted to same-sex couples or removed from our laws. I have stated several times that I do not care whether we call it \"marriage\" or something else, though I am more likely to fight for same-sex \"marriage\" because in doing so I can tell people that they are losing nothing. If I suggest we change the name of the legal institution of marriage, people will feel they are losing something.\n \n Also, you have stated that everyone person who is married is affected by the legalization of same-sex marriage, and I argue that this is not true at all. Any person who is completely unaware that same-sex marriage is legalized would feel no effects at all. The only effect comes from the discomfort some people might feel knowing that same-sex couples have the same rights they do, and although I'm sorry for that discomfort, it does not justifiy denying rights to same-sex couples.\n \n \nThe only way to make this analogy fit is to say: what does one do to become married? Well, let's apply this to voting. What does one do to become a voter? One places a vote. So, even if voting were illegal for blacks, if he placed a vote, he would still be a voter. He would be breaking the law, but he would still be a voter. What about marriage? Well, to become married, one weds a member of the opposite sex. If one weds a member of the same sex, one is not married. Understand the question-begging yet?\n\n \n There is and remains no \"question-begging\". The black person casting a vote in your example would not have been a \"voter\", and understand that you're saying it is okay to redefine \"voter\" from \"a white male who casts a vote\" to \"any person who casts a vote\" because that is a description of who is allowed to vote, while you are describing what one does while marrying. Yet I don't see any reason one redefinition should be allowed but not the other. Isn't that the real question being begged here?\n \n \nWrong. We are debating the power of the government to redefine words and institutions it did not create.\n\n \n No, it is not wrong. I'm suggesting that the government should change absolutely nothing except the legal side of things, and I do not care what the name of that legal institution is. The government has no power to change the definition of a word, nor does it have the power to change the definition of a religious institution, and to suggest that I am supporting a change to one of these things is absurd, and you have provided no explanation as to how the government would be changing either of these things. If we replace the legal version of marriage with civil unions for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples, then they surely could not even be furthering a change to the common understanding of what the word \"marriage\" means. However, to suggest that it is worse to change the definition of a word than it is to grant the same rights to someone else is a statement bred in evil; I could not care less what \"marriage\" means so long as everyone has the same rights under the law.\n \n \nAnd oddly enough, in making these religious institutions equal under the law, we did not have to redefine any of their central tenants.\n\n \n Yet less oddly, we are not redefining a single religious tenant in granting the same rights to same-sex couples that you currently grant only to yourself and people like you. Your suggestion that a religious institution is being changed is unjustified, illogical, and simply untrue.\n \n \nWrong. It promotes the idea that they are different, yes, but it also promotes the idea that central tenants of a religious faith are not subject to government redefinition.\n\n \n Of course religious faith is not subject to redefinition but as I've stated above, you have provided no evidence, reasoning, or logic to support your claims that a religious faith is being redefined. I believe I have made it completely clear that the government should change only the legal institution of marriage, and you're acting like I'm saying the government should force religions to accept same-sex couples. The government would be changing no religious faith by altering who is allowed to enter a legal institution.\n \n I should also mention that you started your paragraph with \"Wrong\" yet you did not appear to disagree with what my paragraph said.\n \n \nTo promote their own beliefs? I was under the impression that the \"belief\" of homosexuality was genetic, not a decision. Is there some hidden agenda I was not aware of? And it's funny how gays always mock the institution of marriage, with its high divorce rates etc etc. You can see these comments made several times on this thread already. It doesn't seem to me that many gays hold it with much meaning. If gays are so much more committed, why not create civil unions and let them prove that they are more committed with lower divorce rates, less cheating, etc.? Then maybe civil unions would become the \"hip\" thing and marriage would become a minority. emoticon_wow \n\n \n Promoting their own beliefs refers to the religious belief that same-sex relationships are morally good. Every person should have as much right to promote that belief as you have to promote your belief that they are morally wrong. Yet if our law simply denies same-sex couples access to the same legal rights that opposite-sex couples have, then our law is already teaching people that same-sex relationships are wrong.\n \n If you are asking me why some gay rights supporters mock marriage, all I can say is that I think they are attempting to justify same-sex marriage by saying that straight people have already abused marriage. But the truth is, despite what anyone says here, there isn't any reason to believe that gay people would be any more or less committed in a relationship than straight people. Actually, if anything, I'd expect to see a higher divorce rate among same-sex couples for the first generation, simply because that generation is being taught a more liberal value set (which of course has nothing to do with their sexuality). Regardless, we both know that everyone will see \"marriage\" as the thing opposite-sex couples do, and \"civil unions\" as the thing same-sex couples do, and no one will ever see them as equal, nor will the majority group switch to the minority group's institution. And even if they did, it would still be immoral to grant a special legal right to opposite-sex couples.\n \n \nBut along with the genetic line of thought. You argue that our laws never differentiate between people, that they always treat everyone the same. Well, what about those born mentally retarded? They receive certain disability benefits that the majority does not. They go through different educational systems, have different transportation needs, parking spaces, et. al. If homosexuality is genetic, what is the problem with creating laws that treat these people similarly to those born with a disability? I don't believe that a mentally retarded person is any worse than me, but I do believe that they have special needs and that the law treats them differently than me for a reason. Likewise, why would I believe a gay person is worse than me? I don't have to believe that to understand that they need their own special systems. Civil unions are one such system that they can use to help fulfill their need for commitment.\n\n \n Did I say that we don't ever give one set of people special rights under the law? You might be confusing that with me saying, \"We never create two sets of rights that accomplish the same thing\". Certainly we do give special rights to some people under the law. But do you think that's really fair? Is it fair to take tax money from everyone, then use that money to benefit a small number of people? Of course it isn't; that's a terribly unfair thing to do. Yet in the case of retarded people, they need these special benefits that we give to them. We give them those benefits because of the additional hardships they face in life. Justifying inequality is a difficult thing to do, but in the case of retarded people, they really do need better treatment under the law, and we give them that better treatment out of compassion.\n \n In the case of marriage, opposite-sex couples don't experience any additional hardships that morally justifies giving them special benefits under the law. They can have children, and so can same-sex couples. The law is designed that if either group does not have children, they don't recieve the extra legal benefits for those children. If either group could be said to face additional hardship, it would be same-sex couples, who are faced with hatred and intolerance almost everywhere they go. Marriage is not a case of a group with additional need recieving special benefits; it is a case of the majority giving themselves special rights to benefit themselves and promote their own beliefs. That is morally wrong.\n \n \nYou do not understand: his rights are being infringed because the government is redefining a central tenant of his religious beliefs for him.\n\n \n I will state it again: the government is redefining nothing but a legal institution. No religion will have to change its ways. No person will have to use \"marriage\" to mean a same-sex relationship. All that will happen is the rights of same-sex couples under the law will match the rights of opposite-sex couples. Again, it can be called anything, so long as it is called the same thing for everyone.\n \n \nThis is more question begging...hopefully you understand this by now...\n\n \n What? How can you even write that? I'm not begging the question at all. You stated that changing same-sex marriage infringes upon people's rights because it devalues their marriage. I responded with an explanation of why devaluing someone's marriage neither constitutes an infringement of rights (Rights are things you can do; by granting rights to one group of people, the government does not take away anyone else's freedom to do anything. Whether some people feel bad or not is a matter of that individual's own self understanding and ideas, that isn't the government prohibiting the individual from doing something), nor justification for denying anyone rights (people always feel more \"valued\" when they are elevated above others, but that will never justify treating those who are on the bottom unfairly). I answered your question directly with reasoning, and you claim I'm begging the question? Exactly which question am I begging? How is my logic the same thing I'm trying to prove? Your claims that I am begging the question have never been justified, especially not in this case, so please give me an explanation now.\n \n \nYes, his heterosexual marriage has changed in more than just a feeling. If he were now to look up the definition of what he had just done, \"marriage,\" he would find that he had married a \"person,\" and not a \"woman.\" The change is undeniable.\n\n \n That is incorrect. The definition of the word marriage in a book is determined by the author of that book, not by the government. The authors of most dictionaries base their understanding of what the word \"marriage\" means by what the people understand it to mean. Most likely dictionary authors would choose to add an additional possible definition without touching the previous ones, but a dictionary author might choose not to do that as well. Furthermore, if you simply agreed with the solution of the word \"marriage\" being changed to something else legally, this wouldn't even happen at all.\n \n And even further, changing the dictionary definition of the word \"marriage\" in no way changes any heterosexual's marriage. It doesn't matter whether the dictionary definition of the word changes; the heterosexual still has the same love, the same commitment, the same relationships with his or her spouse that they have always had. The heterosexual still has exactly the same marriage with exactly the same \"meaning\", even if same-sex couples are also having their own marriages. Opposite-sex marriage would not be changed even a little. A dictionary definition has nothing at all to do with a couple's marriage. Or if I'm missing how it does, please explain it.\n \n \nSo, my argument was that the lifestyle of the self-married is very difficult, so it \"makes sense\" to give them \"adequate\" benefits. Just like we spend more tax dollars on the handicapped than we do those who are not, we ought to spend more money on those who are in love with themselves. Their problem is genetic, too, so they can't help it. And your last statement: \"your solution to the same-sex marriage problem is \"we just won't give them the same benefits that we give ourselves, and if they want them, they can be like us\". That is unfair no matter how you cut it.\" This supports this theory, after all you accept that self-married cannot obtain the benefits of marriage, so by your logic, expecting them to \"be like us\" if they want the benefits, is \"unfair no matter how you cut it.\"\n\n \n To address the first part of this argument, the self-married are not at any disadvantage or of additional need, as is the case with handicapped or retarded people. The reason we create inequality by giving special benefits to handicapped or retarded people is because they need those special benefits.\n \n In the case of a self-married person, he or she does have all the same benefits of marriage. He gets to count himself as a member of his family, he gets access to his own property rights, he gets to naturalize himself, he can count himself as a dependant on his tax returns, he can count his own children as dependants, he can visit himself in the hospital, he gets to decide what happens to his property if he dies, he can file for a loan with himself, he can count himself and his children for the number of food stamps he should get, etc. Marriage is the addition of another family member, and the benefits are designed not to make married people's lives better than single people, but to allow married people to better take care of each other and to allow them to treat each other's children as their own. I think this means that a single person isn't being treated unfairly. If disagree, then go ahead and fight for him to get a lump sum of money. But the debate over whether single people are being treated unfairly is riddled with reasoning and debate unrelated to same-sex marriage, and it isn't really relevant to a same-sex marriage discussion.",

   "I could keep this pendulum swinging, but I don't see it coming to a halt any time soon. I acknowledge your above points, even though I don't agree with them. I now want to try to bring this debate back. The direct debate over the right for gays to get married has been done many times, and it just isn't going to stop going back and forth between us. So I am going to continue with a far more interesting, less predictable discussion...\n \n The argument over self-marriage is far from being removed from the debate over same-sex marriage. If you really don't understand why, then I will explain when we come to some consensus regarding what we will do about it. \n \n I am deeply in love with myself, through no choice of my own. This love causes me to not function well in society, because I am constantly getting into arguments with myself, and then going through this long and drawn out apology, which I can't put off 'till later or I will get angry at myself and things will get even worse. This usually takes most of my attention off of things like driving, working, and talking to people. There is no way for me to escape my lover, so I can't get away from it...Sometime I wish I didn't love myself so much, but there is nothing I can do about it...I often just look myself in the eyes, and I know it was meant to be...you know?

   "I could keep this pendulum swinging, but I don't see it coming to a halt any time soon. I acknowledge your above points, even though I don't agree with them. I now want to try to bring this debate back. The direct debate over the right for gays to get married has been done many times, and it just isn't going to stop going back and forth between us. So I am going to continue with a far more interesting, less predictable discussion...\n \n The argument over self-marriage is far from being removed from the debate over same-sex marriage. If you really don't understand why, then I will explain when we come to some consensus regarding what we will do about it.\n\n \n I still ask that you read and consider my most recent post, but I am willing to go along with your self-marriage argument if that is what you would rather discuss at the moment.\n \n \nI am deeply in love with myself, through no choice of my own. This love causes me to not function well in society, because I am constantly getting into arguments with myself, and then going through this long and drawn out apology, which I can't put off 'till later or I will get angry at myself and things will get even worse. This usually takes most of my attention off of things like driving, working, and talking to people. There is no way for me to escape my lover, so I can't get away from it...Sometime I wish I didn't love myself so much, but there is nothing I can do about it...I often just look myself in the eyes, and I know it was meant to be...you know? It makes life very difficult, and makes it impossible for me to do well in college or get a good job. If I am willing to marry myself, and proclaim this love to the world, gladly giving up the ability to marry someone else, why shouldn't I get monetary benefits? Don't you understand how difficult my life is? How hard it is to make ends meet, get a good job and put food on the table, much less raise kids?!\n\n \n In my post prior to this, my last paragraph explained why I believe the self-married individual currently has equal rights under the law. Furthermore, the claim that your relationship is more difficult that someone else's seems invalid, as when any individual is angry at himself, he cannot escape himself. The problems of a person marrying himself exist with or without that marriage. \n \n Still, since there is no way to seperate you from yourself, yet you sometimes have a difficult time dealing with yourself, I recommend therapy, so that you might better be able to cope with your life. Since you address yourself as though you are two seperate people, it may well be the case that you are mentally ill and out of touch with reality. If this is true, which it may not be, it would be applicable to treat you as any other mentally ill individual, which might include state-funding for therapy.\n \n Lots of people have stress in their lives, but it is neither the state's place nor is it an effective solution to attempt to alleviate individual stress by handing out taxpayer money to stressed people.\n \n Also, you should have no more trouble getting a job, making ends meet, or raising kids than anyone else.",

   "Marriage, religious or simply cultural, has been around a lot longer than govt. recognition of marriage. Marriage is between two people, and the govt. recognizes it.

I believe that it can, and I've given you my reasons in the past (which went undisputed), but if it cannot, then we should allow incestuous marriage. What I know for certain, however, is that same-sex marriage brings no harm and plenty of benefit.\n \n \nErr . . . no. The govt. didn't grant marriage benefits in the late 1700s. In fact marriage was still quite a patriarchal matter at that time. If the founding fathers had \"dreamed up\" legal recogntion for marriage, they would have made it so, but they didn't.

   "No, you are just too bigoted to understand what it is like to have a deep love for yourself. I could just as easily tell a gay person to go get therapy for their homosexuality for being \"out of touch with reality.\"\n\n \n You could not as easily say it with logic backing you. A gay person knows full well the situation, and he or she does not speak as though some fact is untrue. It is fact that you are a single person, yet you were speaking as though you were two. If you actually believed yourself to be two people, then you would be under the belief that a fact is untrue.\n \n If a gay person is having difficulty with his lover to the point that he is demanding something be done about it, I would recommend therapy for him as well. If a gay person believed himself to be multiple people, I would certainly say he is out of touch with reality and could have a mental disorder, for he is clearly only a single person.\n \n \nI'm not just talking about stress. I'm talking about functioning in society. I'm talking about having an equal chance to succeed and achieve my dreams.\n\n \n Well, what is preventing you from functioning in society and achieving your dreams? If it is stress, mental trouble, or emotional trouble, therapy is the best thing I can recommend to help. I'm not going to give you a pile of money to \"ease your mind\" or something like that, if that's what you're implying.\n \n \nI will have much more trouble doing so, because I can't concentrate on anything but my lover. Imagine if your lover was very close to you all the time.. imagine now that they are on top of you 24/7. This would be very distracting if you were in any way attracted to that person. Well it's the same for me, and I'm very attracted. Add to this distractive attraction all the other things that come with being around your lover: bickering, discussion, debate, anger, necessary apologies, and a whole host of very strong emotions that require my utmost attention. For example, I'm a hazard when I drive, so I have to take public transportation. I take tests in college, but never finish in time because my lover is always all over me!\n\n \n So let me list the problems here. First, you are constantly bickering, discussing things, debating, getting angry, and apologizing to yourself. Also, your sexual attraction to yourself interferes with your daily activities. This becomes distracting when you drive and take tests in college. I don't particularly see why discussing things with yourself would be a problem, unless you start discussing things at an inappropriate situation. Since you only have one mind, getting angry at yourself, debating with yourself, and apologizing to yourself at inappropriate times sounds like a difficulty to focus on the task at hand. Again, therapy might help, or even some sort of \"learn things faster\" seminar which helps people learn to focus and organize their thoughts. If you are so entangled in your thoughts that you are actually unable to focus enough to even drive yourself around, I very much recommend some sort of mental help.\n \n If this truly isn't the result of a mental disorder, then the solution seems simple: don't ignore what you're doing. You are the one starting the arguments and bickering with yourself, so simply don't do it. Simply because you are in love with yourself does not mean that you are any more prone to inner turmoil or mental arguments and bickering than anyone else, and it does not mean that your inner turmoil should be handled in a different way than anyone else's. You speak as though you're unable to seperate yourself from someone, but in reality you're the only one there. I would sooner give special benefits to siamese twins for the bickering and arguments you're complaining about than I would give them to a single person who just can't stop debating with himself. \n \n The mind of a person who loves himself could not suddenly split into two minds, and I think you'll do well to remember that before telling me how much loving yourself has caused you do bicker and argue with yourself. Loving yourself would do no such thing. You're presenting me with someone who has the problems of a schizophrenic, not a person who just loves himself.",

I have been attracted to many people, but I have never been unable to control myself. I am also attracted to myself.

I agree. They should be able to form whatever contractual agreement they see fit. This is the land of the free, no? NO.\n \n \nOpen gays and lesbians should be able to serve in our military.\n\n Sure, why not?\n \n \nAge ought not play a part in marriage if love is truly involved.\n\n But only true love is not involved. There is the matter of a legal contract.\n Also, a child is not a consenting adult.\n \n \nPeople truly in love with themselves should be able to marry themselves.\n\n Well, since the definition of marriage involves \"bringing together to make one\" then that doesn't make sense.\n \n But, whatever, nothings stopping you. Marry yourself. I just did (in the eyes of god).\n \n \n \nAny number of, if not all of, the above should allow adoption\n\n All of the ones above that are consenting adults should be allowed a chance to adopt, just like anyone currently allowed that chance. They should be able to go through the same hell as anyone trying to adopt. (Adoption is far from an easy process.)\n \n \nAre we prepared for that? Would it be good for society?

   "All of this stuff about a person \"even being suspected of being homosexual\" is further evidence that you have no understanding of army culture. In the army, you are around other men all the time. This makes for a lot of XXX-grabbing camaraderie that goes way beyond your favorite football teams.

That wouldn't lead to rumours that someone is gay and in the closet, I wouldn't think, in any setting. \n \n \nIn the army, no one \"suspects\" anyone of being gay unless they come out and say, \"I am gay.\" If a civilian were to spend some time amidst our troops, they would witness a lot of behavior that they would probably consider to be homosexual, but it is in fact only a manifestation of the comfort that the troops feel around each other.\n\n \n Here again, I didn't mention anything about XXX grabbing. I honestly wouldn't consider that to be necessarily gay. It would depend on the context of course.\n \n \nShort of kissing or actually performing gay sexual acts, I have never witnessed a person in the army \"shunned\" for being \"suspected\" of being gay.\n\n \n You may not have seen it, yet it does happen...\n \n http://www.davidclemens.com/gaymilitary/campbell4.htm\n \n How much do you think those who are in the closet are going to complain?

Well, in this reality we live in, problems are complicated. The easiest way I can explain it is to say that certain parts of the country, from which many of our enlisted personnel tend to come, are infused with a value system, either by their parents or by their friends, which includes the non-toleration of gays. The problem with ignoring this fact and instituting open gays in the military is the very real risks it will bring to the members of that unit. The remedy is simply to give it more time while those parts of the country catch up to you and I's current social values.
