   "This has two parts, so lets answer it as such:\n \nOriginally posted by letgo \n for the belevers in god out there answer me this.\n \n say i was a good person in general but rejected god, am i going to hell? \n\n \n This question goes astray from the start, but lets go with it for a while anyways.\n \n Alright, lets assume that you are a good guy by common standards - I certainly have no reason to say otherwise - BUT, you reject God. \n \n Since God, by definition is soverign over what He created, He sets the standard for good in His relations with you. If you reject Him, is that good? If He, in his capabliity to see what fate you would have IN rejecting Him AND His role as Father to you, WARNS you and you still reject Him, is that good? \n \n You ask the wrong question. The correct question is \"If I am warned ahead of time of certain ramification to my actions that could be harmful to me by someone who loves me and has my best interests at heart, and in an act of open defiance continue to engage in said dangerous behavior, should my other good qualities entitle me to escape the consequences of my bad actions?\n \n No matter how good you are, if you reject God, you WILL go to Hell. \n \n \nand if so do you think its right that your god would send good people to hell? \n \n \n Here you are so far off the mark I really don't know where to begin. God doesn't send people to Hell, you choose to go there.\n \n Imagine, for a moment, we were walking down a busy downtown street - you going east, me going west. \n \n As we pass each other, you stop me and tell me not to step into the next intersection when the light changes because if I do, a bus will run through the light and hit me, mangling my body in a senseless and violent death. \n \n One of two things is going to happen - either I am going to say \"Get away from me you nutcake!\", and walk on past, or I will ask \"How do you know this is what will happen?\" Which one I do is my choice\n \n For our discussion lets assume the latter - you tell me God told you this would happen. Either I will heed the warning or dismiss it and proceed on down the street. Once again, my choice.\n \n Let's say I proceed on to the intersection (whether I think you're crazy or mistaken is irrelevant), and when the light changes... \n \n WHAM!!!!!!\n \n A bus slams into me, dragging me underneath for 300 feet. \n \n As difficult as that image may be, imagine what YOU will be feeling at that moment. \n \n Your head becomes swimmy. You say to yourself, \"I could have stopped this. Maybe if I had been more persistant. Maybe if I had tried to physically restrain him from getting to the intersection.\" Maybe you cry hysterically, or scream in frustration and rage, or vomit in the gutter. All that runs through your mind is \"I knew this would happen, yet I could not stop this person from dying?\" ------ \n \n This is very much what we Christians feel when we witness to other people of different religions and beliefs. \n \n We Christians DO claim to have a different relationship with God than others do - because we claim that in our search for God, God reached out and took our hand, lifted us out of the blinding fog we were walking around in, looked us square in the eye and said \"I've got a hold of you. Now you reach back into the fog and grab someone else's hand and lead their hand to Mine.\" \n \n This is because those who do not \"grab the hand of Jesus\" are fated to continue to wander around in the fog, where there are things also wandering around just waiting to run into them. People stay trapped in the fog wondering if those \"things\" are what they are looking for. We know there will come a time when His hand will be pulled away - not because He wants to pull it away, but because no one else wants to come up out of the fog. \n \n THAT is something that sends most Christians into panic attacks (explaining why some Christians witness to others sooo badly) - many of those lost in the fog are people we love desperately. And even if we don't know these people at all, why would we not warn them that those things in the fog are the buses that are about to hit them. But it is still their choice as to whether to come up out of the fog.\n \n I'm sure you have heard the story of how, when Christians stand before Jesus, He will \"dry all their tears.\" Most people, including many of my fellow Christians think this will be a happy time. \n \n They are sadly mistaken. \n \n Remember the scene in \"Schindler's List\" where Liam Neeson stands there in the train yard screaming into Ben Kingsley's chest, \"That car... I could have saved 14 more people. This pin, it's solid gold. I could have bought four more people! Those people are dead because I kept this pin!\" \n \n That is what I will go through when I stand before Jesus to give an accounting for my life. \n \n Yes, all my tears will be wiped away. But for one moment in eternity I will ask myself what else I could have done to prevent someone else from deciding they would rather be hit by a bus..... \n \n Peace, Tom",

   "papabryant,\n \n Before I go off into disecting your previous post I just have a few questions.\n \n 1. How old are you (Its relevant)\n 2. When raised (presumably by parents) did you attend church services, church feild trips, and or sunday school?\n 3. Were your parents Christians\n 4. At what age did you make the decision to be one?\n 5. Did you ever question Christian morals?\n \n I'll continue my reply to your reply with why I'm asking those questions\n \n \n Let me also give you one or two scenarios\n \n 1. A boy is raised by Christian parents, and accepts the enviorment and beleif system he is raised into to be true.\n He questions it on occasion, but just remembers what his sunday school teacher always had taught him, as well as his parents, freinds and community had endorsed. One morning he is so mad he hates god, and swears at the sky. He dounces Jesus and declares himself an atheist. He goes to school that day and kills 10 people. (Reason unknown) He stands bewildered at what he has just done and begins to weep. He kneels down to pray and \"ask Jesus for forgivness\". As he kneels down to pray a teacher who is paranoid and carries a gun with her shoots the student in the head. He is instantly killed.\n By your judgment he goes to hell...\n Now lets change that just a bit\n (scenario 2)\n He goes to school that day with a gun. Kills 10 of his fellow students. He kneels down to beg for forgivness. He sits for 10 minutes and prays and prays and begs and begs. The teacher then grabs the gun and shoots him.\n Now by your standards he goes to heaven?\n \n Is this justice?\n \n (If you are to say that \"well god knows he was going to repent so he would have gone to heaven\". Well... I'll let you say that before I give my opinion on it.)\n \n Now to the dissecting...\n \n \"Since God, by definition is soverign over what He created, He sets the standard for good in His relations with you. If you reject Him, is that good? If He, in his capabliity to see what fate you would have IN rejecting Him AND His role as Father to you, WARNS you and you still reject Him, is that good?\"\n \n - Are my parents \"soverign\" over me. Meaning when I disobey them and \"reject them\" should they be allowed to kill me? \n \n \"No matter how good you are, if you reject God, you WILL go to Hell.\"\n \n - Do you honestly beleive that the punishment fits the crime?\n \n \"As we pass each other, you stop me and tell me not to step into the next intersection when the light changes because if I do, a bus will run through the light and hit me, mangling my body in a senseless and violent death. \"\n \n - Not to be mean, but I think thats a horrible unfit example.\n \n \"THAT is something that sends most Christians into panic attacks (explaining why some Christians witness to others sooo badly) - many of those lost in the fog are people we love desperately. And even if we don't know these people at all, why would we not warn them that those things in the fog are the buses that are about to hit them. But it is still their choice as to whether to come up out of the fog.\"\n \n - Are you seeking sympathy?\n \n \n \"Yes, all my tears will be wiped away. But for one moment in eternity I will ask myself what else I could have done to prevent someone else from deciding they would rather be hit by a bus..... \"\n \n - Once again a weird \"nut cake\" on the street telling you that a bus is going to run you over is a just a bit diffrent than someone telling you \"this is how the world works, and if you don't beleive me your going to hell.....\n \"I don't care how many people you help, your going to go to hell if you don't beleive what I beleive.\"\n \n Thanks for reading this\n \n Always Stay Open Minded",

   "If He, in his capabliity to see what fate you would have IN rejecting Him AND His role as Father to you, WARNS you and you still reject Him, is that good? \n \n \n If one didn't believe in the deity, obviously they wouldn't believe in the actions (like a warning) of the deity.\n \n \nThe correct question is \"If I am warned ahead of time of certain ramification to my actions that could be harmful to me by someone who loves me and has my best interests at heart, and in an act of open defiance continue to engage in said dangerous behavior, should my other good qualities entitle me to escape the consequences of my bad actions?\n \n \n That's not the question at all.

God doesn't send people to Hell, you choose to go there.\n \n \n Only a masochist would CHOOSE suffering.

More likely, I would come up to you screaming \"Aliens are going to abduct you! They're coming for us all! RUN RUN RUN!\" You have no reason to take this warning seriously. There is no reason to think that aliens are going to take you, so you're not going to start sprinting off.\n \n Or how about this...you're walking down the street one day and I come up to you and I say \"hey buddy, you keep ignoring me when I talk to you through my interdimensional psychic-phone\" You're confused. But I don't really care, so I knock you out and bring you to my house and keep you alive enough so I can torture you forever. What do you have to complain about? You CHOSE to go to my basement and suffer.",

   "I'm going to make a partial answer to your post now(as it is 11:30 pm est.), and finish at work tomorrow. I do thank you for your patience. I had today off from work, but also a lot of errands to run.\n \n \n \nOriginally posted by SilentPoet \n \n 1. A boy is raised by Christian parents, and accepts the enviorment and beleif system he is raised into to be true.\n He questions it on occasion, but just remembers what his sunday school teacher always had taught him, as well as his parents, freinds and community had endorsed. One morning he is so mad he hates god, and swears at the sky. He dounces Jesus and declares himself an atheist. He goes to school that day and kills 10 people. (Reason unknown) { Actually the reason is revealed in your question. He is obviously angry, that reason unknown. But it is a minor point in your larger issue.  }He stands bewildered at what he has just done and begins to weep. He kneels down to pray and \"ask Jesus for forgivness\". As he kneels down to pray a teacher who is paranoid and carries a gun with her shoots the student in the head. He is instantly killed.\n By your judgment he goes to hell...\n\n \n Actually, no... He goes to Heaven.\n \n The key phrase here is \"He kneels down to pray and 'ask Jesus for forgivness'.\" IF that act of repentance is genuine, and not some ploy or reasoned out means of escaping both temporal and divine justice, then this killer will go to Heaven.\n \n This is really a variation on the \"Could Hitler go to Heaven?\" question. It touches on two subjects; the nature of Mercy, and the question of whether forgiveness on the eternal level exempts one from justice on the Earthly level. Let's take the last one first.\n \n The obvious answer is \"no\", a person is not exempt from acts of justice on Earth because they have obtained forgiveness from God. The whole system of substitutionary atonement hinges on this fact; from the scapegoat to Christ Himself. SOMETHING must set the scales of justice arright.\n \n Even manmade systems such as Hammarabi's code recognizes that justice must be served in order to keep social order and allow individual psychological and spiritual healing for the victims of crime. If a crime occurs those who were victimized are entitled to have compensation for their loss, either in having the criminal lose something of equal value (eye for an eye), or economic compensation to offset the problems the crime will cause later. The values for compensation are easily set, except in cases of economic compensation in which the rulers set the value on a fixed scale. And this was common throughout the Ancient Near East.\n \n However, divine values are harder to define, and logically one must BE divine to be able to set them. While on an Earthly level to some it might seem at first glance that refusal to \"accept Christ\" as a substitutional atonement resulting in eternity in Hell is unjust, but on the divine level it isn't. While our own actions might be the justification for punishment in Hell, the reason for Mercy even being offered has nothing to do with Justice.\n \n Think of it this way ---- Is it right that a child born to a crack addict has to suffer through withdrawls, and emotional and developmental hardships because of the mother's addiction? No, but those problems are there nonetheless, and they must be dealt with - period. And there are only certain ways to deal with those problems that work; you cannot simply do what you want and expect the problem to go away. If you do not follow the right course of treatment that crack baby not only doesn't get better, it gets worse, and begins to engage in actions that harm others, thus calling in the need for justice.\n \n Bottom line is we inheritted our \"addiction\" to sin from Adam. It isn't right or fair that we bear this burden, but we do. It must be dealt with, or the problem gets worse by our own actions taken that must be set right. And the only thing that will work to fix the problem is Jesus Christ. \n \n And with that, and the reminder that its 1:00 am and I have to work today - I'm calling it a night. I look forward to your reply.\n \n Peace, Tom",

   "why is it good OR just to believe in God? why does it matter? why should God even care?\n \n I think the claim that God is the embodiement of good is fallacious. If there is a God, he is both good and evil. The principles of judiasm and christianity differ on this, jews say god can do wrong, christians say he can't. As a Jew, I believe that justice, divine and otherwise, has to come through the dialectical process. Nothing can be considered untouchable, everything must be justified indepedently. So what's the independent justification for the importance of theism, even assuming there is a God?\n \n Papabryant, you claim that God has ultimate authority over divine offenses, because he's divine. I don't dispute the point. Similarily, the US govt. has ultimate authority over domestic law. But might (authority) doesn't make right. The laws and policies they enact need to be justified independently from the fact that they can.\n \n Tom Friedman in \"From Beirut to Jerusalem\" tells an interesting story about the Israel/Palestine conflict. Many palestinean terrorists/informants are tried in military courts in Israel. They are denied due process, the right to see incriminating evidence etc.. Now, Israel is a modern, western style democracy. It doesn't have much tolerance for violating rule of law. So everything it does to Palestineans is codified. A judge can look at a palestinean who has no idea what he is being charged for, say \"I'm sorry for your plight, but...\" and then recite 33 paragraphs of Israeli code that \"ties his hands.\" The fact that something is codified doesn't make it right. The fact that the law was written by someone who, by all accounts, has the authority to write laws STILL doesn't make it just. There needs to be independent support for the law. I don't think that there is any for that particular policy (God sending non-believers to hell).",

Evolution has been observed, even to the extent that speciation events have been observed. But no knowledgable person \"believes\" in evolution. It is a tentative acceptance that the explanations of the data are correct. Show me that it is wrong and propose a better explanation and I'll go with that. In the time being, evolutionary theory is the best we've got.\n \nAll of the intricacies are not spelled out.\n\n Please specify what you are talking about. Do you mean that we don't undrestand everything? Duh! How does that cast doubt on what we do know - for sure. Evolution happens. We have seen it happen.\n \nThere are big questions concerning evolution yet most in science accept it without question.\n\n Bullroar! Most scientists accept it because they did question it. Unlike blind faith, science doesn't claim to have the answer to every question. Science is a process of learning through observation, hypothosis, prediction, and testing. Shouldn't it give you a clue that \"most in science\" accept evolutionary theory at the best explanation for the observed facts at this time? Of degreed biologists, 99% accept evolution. Of degreed scientists in general, 95% accept evolution. Generally biologists have higher percentages, chemists and biochemists have low percentages. \n \nThey disregard some of the things that are in opposition to evolution because of the other evidence in favor of it.\n\n Bullcrap! Put up the evidence the evidence that has been disregarded. My bet is that it is a load of XXXX that has been debunked countless times over decades. And yet, creationists still claim that it is valid.\n \nThey believe in evolution because it is the best answer so far.\n\n Exactly! Given the evidence, evolutionary theory explains the changes in living organisms that have been observed. How absolutely amazing that evolution has been observed, speciation has been observed, and evolutionary theory is routinely used to predict the course of infectious diseases.\n \nChristians believe in Christianity because it is the best answer so far.\n\n But what is the question? The difference is that evolutionary theory is based on observations in the real world. Science is based on evidence. Christianity is based on no evidence at all. It is faith. And if you wish to claim that you have evidence (empirical and tested, as is evolutionary evidence), then it isn't faith, is it?",

   "I know this is a debate between yourself and Poet, but I had to throw my two cents in here if only to this one point you made.\n \n \n\n The fact remains that God is an unproven idea.\n\n \n \nSo is evolution. So is the Big Bang. Many ideas are unproven.\n\n \n There are two distinct differences between proving the Big Bang/evolution vs proving God. The first is Big Bang/Evolution ideas are based on physical evidence and the second is that Big Bang/Evolution are bound to become fact or fiction eventually.\n \n #1 The Big Bang and evolution were theories created to explain physical events. These events were analyzed and logical but unproven theories were created to explain them. God is not based on anything physical at all. If you logically showed that God created the universe, then the theory of Big Bang dies instantly because something physically was proven to discredit it. Nothing physical can disprove the idea of God because it is not based on physical evidence, only ideas.\n \n #2 The theories of Big Bang and evolution will evolve, pardon the pun, over time as new information becomes available and given the history of discovery, it is very likely that at the current pace of technology these two theories will one day become common fact or obvious fiction. In the case of God, if things continue at the pace they are today there will never be evidence to prove or disprove him. A time machine that allows us to travel back to the first day of time is about the only thing that would ever be able to provide conclusive proof that God does or doesn't exist unless he shows himself to us. And based on our known history, we can know evolution and Big Bang will reach finality while God may go on forever without a real answer.\n \n So in short, you cannot expect to equate the Big Bang being unproven to God being unproven. God is a spiritual belief while the Big Bang is physical belief. God may never be proven to exist or not while the Big Bang will eventually be proven true or false.\n \n My point to all of this is that with the Big Bang, at least I can show you something that declares it possible to be true while the theory of God provides nothing. The Big Bang and evolution provide enough evidence to support themselves based on the sum total of human knowledge at this time. So I don't understand why you would compare spiritual unknowns to physical possibilities.",

No, in Hell there's REAL danger - of losing your mind. \n \n I'm not going to tell you what to do, because I think it would be wrong, and useless. You seem like a smart and intelligent girl, I'm sure, in due time, you will make the right decision for yourself.\n Have a good day!",

   "Dear Oshi, (My post is again apparently too long, I've split it up into two.)\n \n 'to be a witch, you must be brave enough to face evrything inside of you, and have the courage to changet he things you do not like. being a witch has nothing to do with spells, rituals, and unusual clothing- they are the fun stuff. to be a witch is to desire personal transformantion'\n \n This often happens. They dress it up as being \"fun\". The mere fun you might have on this earth is completely minuscule to the infinite happiness and joy that one can achieve in Heaven. \n \n I think that you have misunderstood. It's much deeper then you just \"calling yourself\" a witch. I don't have the wrong idea. I know, you don't fly on a broomstick with a pointy hat and a black cloak. What I can tell you, the Bible doesn't speak highly of a witch or witchcraft.\n \n You ask why I brought the devil up. I explained it. The Devil is associated with witchcraft. It does not come from God.\n \n and then we all go home.. much like church cept more fun..\n \n Have you noticed? They repeatedly want to ensure that your having \"more fun\". Fun seems like a pretty major thing on your list, but there are better things.\n \n If I was trying to imply that you were a Satanist, I would have come right out and said it. You have claimed that you are not, so I believe you. However, I must warn you, the path that you are going down leads near enough to Satanism.\n \n What have I seen.\n \n I know a young girl, Fifteen years of age. She, like you, found Church boring. She got into \"witchcraft\" from a friend, just like you. She didn't want to at first, but her friend pleaded her to, so in the end she went. She, as you did again, find it a lot more fun.\n Shall I tell you what happened when the fun ran out? They did, as I said, treaded in deeper waters. Started cutting themselves. They started doing \"tasks\", getting in trouble with the police. She tried to get out, she couldn't. Then a law order was passed for the cult to leave her. And, they did. Do you think she's all fine now? She is quite the opposite, she suffers from various lasting side effects brought about by the influence of cults. Her case is not a \"one of\" this happens to people, every week, possibly every day.\n \n I'll tell you how cults work:\n \n Recruiting New Members \n Psychological Persuasion \n Threat of Intimidation \n Physiological Persuasion \n Intruding into the Workplace \n \n How many of those have you seen so far? \n \n Cults often target children. Why? Because they are increasingly more vulnerable. It is easier to brainwash, do mind control, use hypnosis on a child. I'll tell you the steps of a cult. So far, are they going to plan?\n \n Stage 1: THE SEDUCTIVE APPEAL OF UNITY \n \n The developing pattern of new cults from infancy to maturity is quite fascinating. They all center around one charismatic leader in the beginning. There is much euphoria among the little group over the idea of being the only ones whom God has blessed with the teachings of his \"chosen servant.\" There is a bond of intimacy within the group based on this common identity, a kind of intimate friendship not found among orthodox Christians; 2 somewhat similar to the excitement of belong ing to a secret club. Much effort is expended in making new converts, as the converts must learn to change their whole way of thinking to match that of the cult leader. 3 Because they have put so much work into converting individuals, and because the vict ims end up as, in effect, clones of themselves, they are excited for the new converts and heap much special attention on them, almost as if they were sons or daughters to them. Indeed, many are openly labeled as their spiritual children. Lik e doting mothers and fathers, the spiritual parents watch carefully over their new convert to see that their faith is not shaken by new discoveries or by their reading literature which exposes them as a cult. In the case of the Moonies, for instanc e, if a initiate decides to leave the group, the others quickly pull them back into their circle and physically and emotionally make a big fuss over them, using the security and emotional bonding of the group as the magnet to draw them back in. \n \n Within a few months, however, the initiate is expected to \"tow the line\" like everyone else, and the special attention disappears. It is replaced with the yoke of servitude. \n \n Stage 2: CONFERRING INFALLIBILITY \n \n In time, however, the new organization faces accusation from the churches and others who become concerned over their methods of indoctrination as well as their isolation of the victim from his family and former friends. Some who oppose them are sincerely concerned with the well-being of the initiate, while others simply strike out blindly against the oddity of the cults. The existence of the latter type of opposer is capitalized on by the cult leader(s), and much propagand a is then spread to stigmatize outsiders who criticize the group. The propaganda is quite effective in convincing the initiate that all who oppose their group are either demonic or seriously misled by the devil, and must be avoided at all costs. So me, like Jehovah's Witnesses and Mormons, will become quite angry and rebuke the initiate for listening to \"apostates\" and will threaten them with group ostracism and excommunication if they entertain such thoughts for long.\n \n \n \n In the meantime, hypocrisy usually appears from within the cult leadership itself, planting the seeds of destruction that will later be the undoing of the cult. Unlike the appearance of hypocrisy in the average church, it is not as easi ly explained away in the cults, since they are supposedly \"God's exclusive representatives to the world.\" The followers cannot just go to another church in response. They have been conditioned to view other churches as false religions, and criticism of th e organization or its leaders will not be tolerated. \n \n This development prepares the stage for \"purges\" of those within the ranks who cannot stomach the lying or deception they may notice. The followers soon become divided: the \"loyal\" ones allow their consciences to be dulled to the real m oral issues and justice as they re-affirm their leader as God's chosen spokesman, while the dissenters refuse to tolerate the power play going on in God's name. Dissent, of course, can be for noble motives, or it can even be a power play by others within the group to gain control or at least to obtain more power themselves. The existence of the latter form of dissent is quickly used to stigmatize all dissenters, and dissent for any reason is seen as evil. The cult leader thus effectively iso lates himself from criticism, thereby becoming infallible for all practical purposes, though usually denying such.\n \n Such purges must occur periodically to \"keep the organization clean.\" That is simply another way of saying that they need to kick out those who are independent thinkers, the greatest enemies of cults. In some cults, such as the M oonies, the family is viewed as the enemy, since families are, in effect, little independent nuclei themselves, and can breed differences of opinion or practices hidden from the rest of the group. In others like the Mormons, Worldwide Church of God and Jehovah's Witnesses, the family is seen as valuable, but dissenters from within the family must be quickly exposed, or the judgment of the \"apostate\" will also fall upon the head of the one failing to report his mother, child, or best friend. This Na zi-like mentality must be bred to ensure a proper policing of the ranks. It also makes dissent much more unlikely, because of the high price that must be paid by the one who attempts to speak out and be heard. He will lose both his spiritual as wel l as his literal family permanently. If a member leaves, the others are not allowed to talk to them from then on, for fear of being contaminated. This is also effective as a form of psychological punishment intended to bring them back into the cult. Predi ctably, it often works.",

   "Stage 3: THE SCHOLASTIC DISHONESTY OF THE CULT \n \n Not only are there attacks from inside the group and outside by well-meaning persons, but there are those who will publish writings or give lectures that refute the doctrines of the cult as unbiblical. The scholastic dishonesty o f the group is the first thing to be attacked, since most cults rarely contain any truly educated men familiar with Biblical language and history. Since cults do not disclose their method of interpretation, they will either plainly admit that they receive direct revelations from God, or that \"they simply accept the Bible for what it says.\" That fallacy is immediately refuted by producing just one Scripture that they interpret in a less-than-literal fashion! They must have some means of categorizing doctrines and verses, and these are always found in their publications. Their publications ARE their method of interpretation. \n \n At this stage, the organization learns to become adept at making excuses for their changes in doctrine over the years by claiming that God is progressively revealing them things, or by denying that they ever made doctrinal change s at all, preferring to call them \"clarifications.\" \n \n When the cult leader is accused of making interpretive errors due to a misunderstanding of the Biblical languages or to inaccurate historical information, they will usually ignore the accusations. If enough discussion is generated by di ssenters, they will, of course, be forced to provide an answer, at least to satisfy the doubts of their own people. This answer usually comes in one of two forms. Either they (a) misrepresent the point in question, in effect making a \"straw man\" ou t of the supposed error, or they will look high and low to find someone who is recognized among scholars that agrees with them on a certain point (as if finding one person who agrees with them is sufficient). Usually they cannot find a reputable scholar, so they will resort to quoting others who are on the fringes of the scholastic world, i.e., the liberals or eccentrics. If they are bold enough to quote recognized authorities, they usually take their statements out of context or only partially quote them . They often get away with this without repercussions, as few scholars are in a position to afford a lawyer for a misrepresentation suit. \n \n The followers of the organization readily accept all such proof provided by its own writers. After all, they are not supposed to study the books of real scholars themselves, and so they trust their leaders to study them when necessary, so as to refute \"opposers.\" The writers of their publications, on the other hand, continually pore over such \"outside\" material, seeking to find whatever justification they can to support their position. They have no interest in what the scholars are actu ally saying, as they are simply out to verify organizational policy. The mind of these self-styled apologists becomes a labyrinth of inconsistency as they must continually rationalize their taking statements out of context and misrepresenting autho rs. This is also true of the cult leader himself, since he must sooner or later make decisions to preserve unity that will cause harm to others, because, in his mind, the end justifies the means. Having become morally corrupt, he is no longer capab le of recognizing truth, let alone speaking it.\n \n The language of a cult is developed over a long period of time. Not only are there special \"buzz\" words that have a meaning exclusive to the group, but words traditionally used by Christians become twisted according to their own view. T hey may use words like \"born again,\" \"saved,\" \"holy spirit,\" etc. but they come to mean something entirely different than in the outside world. This aids them in making converts, since they must appeal to the outsider initially by convincing him that they \"pretty much believe the same thing\" as other Christians, only later turning the initiate on to the more esoteric or strange beliefs of the group. Conversion is a slow process of brainwashing, as words take on new meanings, and previous religious views o r hopes are seen as erroneous.\n \n Though cults which fit this pattern may seem to continue on indefinitely, even growing at alarming rates, their structure is slowly crumbling at the foundations. Formed initially as a group of dissenters from Christianity themselves, th ey eventually become a massive \"mother\" organization, with its own dissenters breaking away. Because of their scholastic dishonesty and their treatment of dissenters, they never lose their reputation as a cult unless they make radical changes, which would result in loss of many members. Since members are their source of power and income, this simply will not happen to any notable extent, other than their admitting to being imperfect and subject to mistakes. \n \n Such organizations are, in effect, sealed in a course of history. All cults seem to go down the same road. In the end, the persecuted, if they grow, will become the persecutors. As the quest for power rears its ugly head, thousands will be discarded alongside the road, bringing great bloodguilt on the organization. \n \n THE SILENT VICTIMS \n \n Nothing is quite so sad as the former cult member who has just discovered he has wasted X years of his life pursuing a mythical religion. The author can certainly vouch for that, having spent eight years in such a group. The ex-c ultist easily becomes suspicious of all religious people, giving others the impression that he is an agnostic; while he is usually just afraid of religion rather than the Bible or God. Former cultists may blame God or their parents for allowing them to ge t involved in a cult, and this has to be dealt with by others who are in a position to help, such as a support group for ex-cultists. The local church is often in a position to help, if the person can actually bring himself to inquire. \n \n The most effective remedy for the ex-cultist is to realize that the Bible is much different than what they have come to believe. There are sound methods for interpreting it, just as any historical document can be interpreted according t o its history, its language, and the customs of its people. This is one of the hardest thoughts to get across to the ex-cultist, as he sees the Bible as a confusing book with many possible interpretations (so why bother?). Orthodox Christian scholars (mor e so than local pastors) can help them to understand the roots of Christianity. \n http://www.caic.org.au/general/cultptrn.htm\n \n I'm pretty sure that my efforts to help you are in vain. I'm 99% sure you'll disregard my post. That is what they have trained you to do. To think that \"there's nothing wrong\". The world can see there is. I guess all I can do is pray for you, and wish you the best.\n \n Thanks for your reply. And once again, have a good day.",

   "Dear Yoshi, (Again my post is apparently to long, apologies.)\n Well now, I understand what you are saying about the Mormons. However, you must realise that Mormonism is not a sect of Christianity, but it is a Cult. I wouldn't advice someone to get involved with them really. I described in the threads above what Cults can do.\n \n have seen none of these. not including the mormons.\n\n The reason I wrote so much on cults, in the threads above, is because that is what you are a part of, at the moment. This group that you attend, I'm not to sure about all of the ways that cults work, but the group you speak of, certainly shows two of the signs:\n \n Recruiting New Members \n Psychological Persuasion \n \n Catholicism. Although some might disagree, it hasn't shown any signs or creating any reason for people to suggest that Catholicism uses any brainwashing techniques. In fact, it is quite the opposite. Catholicism is reasonably strict, and is far more conservative. \n \n I'm glad to see that you enjoy attending Church, and it's great to see that you are still holding, if very slightly, onto your Faith. Unfortunately, you cannot technically be part of \"both\". A quote from The Bible:\n \n Matthew 6:24 :: King James Version (KJV)\n No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other.\n \n A decision must be made sooner or later. It is generally about where your priorities are.\n \n Okay, a cult:\n \n Identifying A Cult\n \n Some have difficulty identifying a cult because it is not so easy to identify one that is not even religious. For this reason, over the years, different definitions of what actually is a cult have developed to make it easier when you know little about their beliefs. \n \n Three different definitions: \n \n Secular Definition\n CULT - From the Latin \"cultis\" which denotes all that is involved in worship, ritual, emotion, liturgy and attitude. This definition actually denotes what we call denominations and sects and would make all religious movements a cult. \n \n Christian Definition \n CULT - Any group which deviates from Biblical, orthodox, historical Christianity. i.e. They deny the Deity of Christ; His physical resurrection; His personal and physical return to earth and salvation by FAITH alone. \n \n This definition only covers those groups which are cults within the Christian religion. It does not cover cults within other world religions such as Islam and Hinduism. Nor does it cover Psychological, Commercial or Educational cults which do not recognize the Bible as a source of reality. \n \n Universal Definition\n CULT - Any group which has a pyramid type authoritarian leadership structure with all teaching and guidance coming from the person/persons at the top. The group will claim to be the only way to God; Nirvana; Paradise; Ultimate Reality; Full Potential, Way to Happiness etc, and will use thought reform or mind control techniques to gain control and keep their members. \n \n This definition covers cults within all majopr world religions, along with those cults which have no OBVIOUS religious base such as commercial, educational and psychological cults. Others may define these a little differently, but this is the simplest to work from. \n \n The 'Orthodox Bible-Based Cult'\n A group is called a cult because of their behaviour - not their doctrines. Doctrine is an issue in the area of Apologetics and Heresy. Most religious cults do teach what the Christian church would declare to be heresy but some do not. Some cults teach the basics of the Christian faith but have behavioural patterns that are abusive, controlling and cultic. \n \n This occurs in both Non-Charismatic and Charismatic churches. These groups teach the central doctrines of the Christian faith and then add the extra authority of leadership or someone's particular writings. They centre around the interpretations of the leadership and submissive and unquestioning acceptance of these is essential to be a member of good standing. This acceptance includes what we consider non-essential doctrines e.i. not salvation issues (such as the Person and Work of Christ.) The key is that they will be using mind control or undue influence on their members. \n \n Using these guidelines of definition, Bible-based, Psychological, Educational and Commercial aberrations can easily be identified. \n \n Other Identification Marks \n (a) The group will have an ELITIST view of itself in relation to others, and a UNIQUE CAUSE. e.i. THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES RIGHT - everyone else is wrong. THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES DOING GOD'S WILL - everyone else is in apostasy. \n \n (b) They will promote their cause actively, and in doing so, abuse God-given personal rights and freedoms. This abuse can be THEOLOGICAL, SPIRITUAL, SOCIAL & PSYCHOLOGICAL. \n \n How They Do This \n Their leader/s may claim a special, exclusive ministry, revelation or position of authority given by God. \n They believe they are the only true church and take a critical stance regarding the Christian church while at the same time praising and exalting their own group, leader/s and work. \n They use intimidation or psychological manipulation to keep members loyal to their ranks. This could be in the form of threats of dire calamity sent by God if they leave; certain death at Armageddon; being shunned by their family and friends etc. This is a vital part of the mind control process. \n Members will be expected to give substantial financial support to the group. This could be compulsory tithing (which is checked); signing over all their property on entering the group; coercive methods of instilling guilt on those who have not contributed; selling magazines, flowers or other goods for the group as part of their \"ministry\". \n At the same time bible-based cults may ridicule churches that take up free-will offerings by passing collection plates and/or sell literature and tapes. They usually brag that they don't do this. This gives outsiders the intimation that they are not interested in money.",

   "There will be great emphasis on loyalty to the group and its teachings. The lives of members will be totally absorbed into the group's activities. They will have little or no time to think for themselves because of physical and emotional exhaustion. This is also a vital part of the mind control process. \n There will be total control over almost all aspects of the private lives of members. This control can be direct through communal living, or constant and repetitious teaching on \"how to be a true Christian\" or \"being obedient to leadership\". Members will look to their leaders for guidance in everything they do. \n Bible-based cults may proclaim they have no clergy/laity distinction and no paid ministry class - that they are all equal. \n Any dissent or questioning of the group's teachings is discouraged. Criticism in any form is seen as rebellion. There will be an emphasis on authority, unquestioning obedience and submission. This is vigilantly maintained. \n Members are required to demonstrate their loyalty to the group in some way. This could be in the form of \"dobbing\" on fellow members (including family) under the guise of looking out for their \"spiritual welfare\". They may be required to deliberately lie (heavenly deception) or give up their lives by refusing some form of medical treatment. \n Attempts to leave or reveal embarrassing facts about the group may be met with threats. Some may have taken oaths of loyalty that involve their lives or have signed a \"covenant\" and feel threatened by this. \n Refugees of the group are usually faced with confrontations by other members with coercion to get them to return to the group. \n \n Some Abuses Of Rights And Freedoms:-\n 1. Abuse Of Individuality: They adopt a \"groupness\" mentality. They are not permitted to think for themselves apart from the group and only accept what they are told. \n \n 2. Abuse Of Intimacy: Relationships with friends, relatives, spouses, children, parents etc are broken or seriously hampered. \n \n 3. Abuse Of Finances: Pressure to give all you can to the group. In non-communal groups, members usually live at the lower socio-economic strata, not because of a lower income level, but because they are always giving money to the group for some reason. \n \n 4. \"Us Versus Them\" Mentality: Isolation from the community in general. Anyone and everything outside the group is seen as \"of the devil\" or \"unenlightened\" etc. Their enemies now include former friends; the Christian church; governments; education systems; the media - the world in general. Those who are involved with these in any way see such involvement as a \"means to an end\". \n \n 5. Abuse Of Time And Energy: The group controls and uses almost all the members time and energy in group activities. They are usually in a constant state of mental and physical exhaustion. \n \n 6. Abuse Of Free Will: They must unquestioning submit to the groups teachings and directions and their own free will is broken. Their \"will\" actually becomes the groups \"will\" without their realizing it. This is done either by coercive methods including low protein diets and lack of sleep, or over a period of time through intimidation. Both methods make heavy use of \"guilt\". \n \n Results Of This Abuse\n 1. Personality Changes \n \n Relatives will say they no longer recognize the person. From a warm, loving personality will come heaped abuse, rejection and feelings of hate. The cult member sees himself as \"righteous\" in comparison and this comes across in their attitude toward all outsiders. \n \n 2. Loss Of Identity \n \n They cannot see themselves as individuals apart from the group. Some even change their name as a rejection of their former life. \n \n 3. Paranoid - We Are Being Persecuted \n \n Any time you say anything negative about the group, whether justified or no, it is regarded as \"persecution\". Any criticism of the individual is also seen as persecution only because they are the \"true Christian\" or \"enlightened\" one - not because they, as an individual, have done the wrong thing. However, at the same time they will feel free to criticise whatever you believe, say and do because they are \"the only ones who are right\". \n \n 4. Social Disorientation \n \n They lose their ability to socialize outside the group. This can go so far as to not being able to structure their time or make simple decisions for themselves when they leave. \n \n Their world-view alters and they perceive the world through their leaders eyes. They become very naive about life in general. \n \n 5. Severe Guilt Complexes \n \n They are made to feel guilty of everything they did before entering the group and are to strive to be \"good\" and \"worthy\" for \"eternal life\". Misdemeanors are made into \"mountains\" so that members are in a constant state of guilt for infringing even the most minor rules. Guilt comes because they aren't doing enough; entertaining doubts or questions; even thinking rationally for oneself. \n \n This guilt is piled upon pile with new rules constantly being laid down about what is sinful and what is not. Illness may be seen as lack of faith - more guilt. Emotional illness may be seen as proof of sin in your life - more guilt. \n \n Summary \n Not all these points will be found in every cult, but all cults will have some if not most of them, although these may vary to some degree. \n http://caicusa.org/general/idencult.htm\n \n I hope that that has help you to identify a cult. If you still do not understand, please ask, I'll be more than glad to help.\n \nyour entire post concerned 'them' and 'they.' who are these people? there is no one else but me.\n\n Ahh, but there is. When I say \"They\" or \"them\", I am referring to people in the cult that you attend, and the leaders there. \n \n i would very much like a church, coven, sacred group, whatever. but i dont think thats gonna happen unless mom will be high priestess and she doesnt want too. so im stuck singing by myself.. \n\n I am slightly confused by this. Your mom? Does your mom disagree with beliefes that you might have?\n \n but if i think it seems as if god is one to be feared more than to be loved\n\n They go hand in hand. God, is above all, a Loving God. God is Love. I didn't much understand fearing God, until I was in High school. Me and my English class had a teacher. Academically, she was one of the best teachers around. She taught us the years course, in a year! She was our friend, but our teacher. She was strict, but still we loved her.\n It is only when she left, and then came back to visit us that I understood. We did fear her, but it was in a Loving way. We had grown to love her as our mother, and we had the highest respect for her. When we had to do work, we did it for her, and evidently, helping ourselves. I'm not too sure if this makes sense, but I'm pretty sure that you'll meat someone like that in your life.\n \n Reading The Bible is a great way to gain your knowledge on Christianity. Many people, these days, are never hesitant to critisize Christianity, and at times, curse Christianity, when they have not read The Bible yet.\n \n I'm slightly confused about this \"bard\" business, I must say. A bard is a poet (especially a lyrical poet). I don't know too much on the history of them, but there doesn't appear to be anything harmless, they dont' appear to relate to a witch in any way. I'll do some extra research for you.\n \n Stereotypical, yes it might be, but not without logical reason. Witches are involved with witchcraft. The concept of witchcraft is quite evil. Like I said before: The Devil is associated with witchcraft. It does not come from God.\n \n Oshi, your post appears to consecutively indicate that you are very mature for your age. The encouraging attitude that you have shown in your post speaks for itself. You seem like a lovely girl, and I'm sure, that in due time, you will make the right decision.\n \n I hate to say this, but the majority of debates with teenagers, unfortunately end up with them going into a \"tantrum\" and being moody. It is here that you have shown your greatest maturity. \n \n I am going away for five days tomorrow, and I'll be back on Thursday. Before then, I won't be able to give you a reply. But, please, do reply here, and I shall read it as soon as I get back.\n \n The weather down here is pretty good actually, quite the opposite of the normal unpredictable London weather. The days have been hot, and the nights have been cool. Unfortunately, this too shall not last. However, I intend on enjoying it as much as possible.\n \n I hope all things are well for you. \n \n Talk to you later!",

Again, one needs to define what \"believing in God\" is. Satan also believes in God, as we all know. It must not be that simple as accepting \"Yes, God exists\". So i looked elsewhere. For example, it is written that \n \nHe that believeth on him is not judged: he that believeth not hath been judged already, because he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God. (John 3:18)[\n \n BUT it goes on describing this judgement in John 3:19-20:\n \n19 And this is the judgment, that the light is come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil.\n 20 For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, lest his works should be reproved.\"\n And then Ephessians 5:9 assures us that \n\"the fruit of the light is in ALL goodness and righteousness and truth\"\n (emphasis mine). ALL. You tell me why the ones who simply do not say \"there is a God\" qualify as 'hating the light' . \n \n \n B.1.No Christian is allowed to judge you (i.e.: You WILL go to hell). For may reasons, starting with \"judge not least ye be judged\" (sorry , i quote off the top of my head and English is not my first language so maybe I made some grammatical mistakes) \n B.2.No-one can know for a fact who is going to Hell and who isn't.\n \n And finally, in my opinion non-Christians, non-Muslims and non-Jews can still avoid their version of damnation if receiving bliss/torture is entirely based on faith. Sure, there is some controversy in each of these areas and probably in other religions who have a Heaven & Hell version as well. But these three are the only ones I somewhat studied, and formed my afore mentioned opinion. If anyone wants to debate this with me, i welcome it; I find debate is always interesting and educational.

   "Hey Oshi emoticon_xbye \n \n Correct me if I wrong, but Wiccans believe in a God and a Godess as a masculine and feminine aspects of a higher divine being. In other words, they believe in ONE God; they are not polytheistic. They have the wiccan rede who is somewhat longer but can be shortened to \"as long as you don't harm others do what you wil.\" and also the three-fold Law, meaning that everything you do, good or bad will come back to you three times. This generally means they try to avoid doing Evil, right? From my discussions with other Wiccans, some are not good though; however if this is not the case with you, why would you be sent to Hell? Please read my above post and let's discuss things, OK? Promise I won't threaten you with eternal fire *smiles from ear to ear*\n \n I am not saying you shouldnt eventually become Christian (or whatever else belief that suits you). What I am saying is that you should take time to discover yourself, your personality, your values --I think in English this is called soul-searching. Yes, your belief system is part of who you are --so if you wish to convert, please research things for yourself first. \n \n dreamweaver\n \n \nYou are not just \"calling yourself\" that, you are acting, and being \"a witch\". The Bible generally doesn't look to highly on witches. Why? Because they are associated with the Devil and witchcraft.\n\n \n They do not have the christian Devil figure. They believe in ONE God just encompassing both masculine and femioine attributes. \"Spells\" are very much like prayers, and most Wiccans have very strict rules about doing that-- for example they cannot cast a healing spell on someone who is ill if the person refuses. They have to respect free will. SOME of them are bad. but again, some Christians are just as bad. Gimme a break, many Nazis were Christian --let alone the neo-nazis now-a-days.\n \n \nI'll tell you how cults work:\n \n Recruiting New Members\n Psychological Persuasion\n Threat of Intimidation\n Physiological Persuasion\n Intruding into the Workplace \n\n \n I agree with the description. oshi (and we all) must be very careful.. Still please don't tell me you think she might be drown into a cult just because she is not Christian? You mean there are no Christian Cults who brainwah their members and who can lead them to depression and suicide? \n \n Sorry. No religion (or lack thereof) is a warranty its followers will treat others in a kind, human way. And your detailed description of cults, while it's very instructive, can well fit large parts of Christianity History. How often, even now-a-days Christians all over the internet try (and I quote you):\n \nconvincing the initiate that all who oppose their group are either demonic or seriously misled by the devil,\n How many Christians of a certain denomination say\n \nThe followers cannot just go to another church in response. They have been conditioned to view other churches as false religions, and criticism of th e organization or its leaders will not be tolerated.\n And God forbid if the ex-follower chooses not another church but another religion.\n \n And here we go again:\n \nOther Identification Marks\n (a) The group will have an ELITIST view of itself in relation to others, and a UNIQUE CAUSE. e.i. THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES RIGHT - everyone else is wrong. THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES DOING GOD'S WILL - everyone else is in apostasy.\n \n (b) They will promote their cause actively, and in doing so, abuse God-given personal rights and freedoms. This abuse can be THEOLOGICAL, SPIRITUAL, SOCIAL & PSYCHOLOGICAL.\n \n\n \n This is what i have seen 98% of Christians doing over the internet. \"Iam right, you are wrong\" \"God is with me, I pity you because you cant accept Him (or my words on Him) too\" \"Only the christian God is the true ine. Your god is not the true one, give it up and embrace mine\" \"I'll pray for you so you will be saved\" \"Believe what i'll say or you'll burn in Hell. Ah no, no, it's not a threat. it's a FACT\" \n \n I do respect your extensive knowledge on cults and on what you wrote. I should apologize for getting all fired up --it always happens to me when it seems to me people try to change what others believe in (proven its not harmful, of course). I have seen persecuted Christians (for not giving up their faith), and i have seen persecuted ex-christians who simply wanted to renounce --from verbal violence over the internet to physical beatings in householdings. Sorry. I have nothing against Christianity or Christ. But I'll fight to death for the right of the persons to believe whatever it suits them, as long as they dont harm others. Because you find XXXXXX amongst ALL religions (and amongst Atheists, no problem).\n \n Best regards.\n \n --edit: don't ask about my beliefs--they are strictly personal",

The reason I know that what I believe is true is it has been tested in every age since the begining of time. God of the Bible has always stood victorious over its aversary. The events and men of the Bible can be historical studied from out side the structure of the Bible and found faithful. The prophecy of the Bible can be found true to the smallest detail. I doubt the wiccan texts or the Koran have such a claim. Jesus said Not one jot or tittle of this word will fade away. That means the smallest part of a letter is divinely secure. In that God have I placed my faith, and in His Son Jesus Christ. That make me a Christ one, or as it is said today Christian. Going to a christian church doesn't make me a christian.

Is it...?\n a) they are masochists\n or\n b) they don't believe they will get caught\n \n Are they masochists, or are they greedy, malicious, avaricious, etc.?\n \n Likewise, you deny God, so if you do something that He condemns it is a type of denial, because you don't believe that\n a) anyone is watching\n b) you will get caught\n \n Later you said \"Even if everyone on Earth recieved (sic) this direct knowledge of a god's existance (sic), they would have every ability to ignore any of it's wishes/commandments/etc. The Christian Satan KNOWS of God's existance (sic) through direct contact and speech, but chooses to rebel anyways.\"\n \n Indeed... so even if you had actually had a vision of God, you could still deny Him. So your rationale that God doesn't exist only because you haven't experienced Him is rather vacuous. He has already revealed Himself to many people, according to His own plan - not yours, and people still deny Him.\n \n As part of your arrogance you would demand that God come to you and display Himself to you - oh, no you wouldn't you say, because you don't believe in Him anyway! So, it's a done deal, you've made up your mind, so even if He did appear before you, you'd deny Him... probably put it down to an hallucination, or CIA drugging the water or something. So what do you want? You can't have Him before you because you don't even believe in Him anyway.\n \n But anyway, I beg you, oh great and knowledgeable personage as you are, why do you think people commit crimes? Masochism? That's a first! Yes, they all go to trial screaming \"Yes, oh Yes! Please that's it lock me up! I enjoy manacles! I love bland food! I love the prospect of getting an exceptionally enlarged anus in the showers!\"\n \n \n \n \n \n *You have already dealt with this issue, so it's complete! \"montal, (sic) I have already addressed the point of people \"choosing\" to go to hell.

So I used the example that taking away this part of religion would be like taking away the ability to throw a baseball. What would be the point of a baseball if you couldn't throw it? You could still look at it. You could pick it up. You could hand it off and walk around with it or roll it. But it really has lost it's main intention which is to be thrown which allows it to be hit.

I know that example is a little crude, but think of it...tequilla comes from the agave plant...a product of the earth. now if god made all on earth, then the agave plant is gods creation. if the agave plant comes from god, then tequilla comes from god. then why do half the sects of the christian faith believe alcohol is \"evil\" and comes from satan. if you are in doubt of this, call any weslyan church and talk to the pastor. a true Wiccan does not worship the devil or god. a Wiccan worships the earth and nature and the beauty provided us by nature. in Wicca, god is not a being but more of a concept, a theme, an untouchable energy. \n \n Qoute:\n \"The path that you are going down leads near enough to satan.\" \n \n -please see above.\n \n I would also like to address a few other issues with you. \n \n 1.: Wicca is a cult. \n -Cult: as defined by The American Heritage Dictionary\n 1: A system of religious worship and ritual.\n 2: A religion or sect considered extremist or false.\n 3: (a).

WRONG! my parents had sex to make me, and perpetuation of the species is a sin...god forbid! i was born damned with original sin! now i am not only responsible for my actions, but the actions taken by my parents before i was even born. what a burden. \n 4. physiological persuation: i must admit, this one stumped me. even after reading you entire post i did not get it. are you referring to drugs? sex? physical mutilation? well, i'm not even sure what this one meant or where you were going with this...but let me state. i have never been asked or encouraged to do drugs by my coven or suggested to do such by Wiccan philosophy. I do have sex, but not ritualistic orgies with my coven in the moonlight. i am married (to a devout christian by the way) and enjoy a monogomous relationship. physical mutilation? like what, cutting up german shepards deep in the woods by candlelight? that's sick, and contrary to many peoples beliefs, Wiccans do not practice ritualistic sacrifice. again, i must appologize if this is not what you meant, but i was not sure what your intent was. \n 5. intrusion into the workplace: this one is a little far fetched i believe. other than catholics fasting on fridays...being hungry...and maybe not perfoming as well as normal, i think you would be hard pressed to find any religion that does this. do you give high communion at lunch? my coven does not form a circle at my watercooler! like i said...a little far fetched. if there are psychological interuptions in the workplace related to religion, they are taken on an individual basis and could occur to a person of any faith.\n \n lastly, i must address one other point. you referred to Wiccans as women. huh? a male cannot be a Wiccan? again, the typical steriotype of a witch appears. an educated person as yourself seems above steriotyping people. Wiccans come from all walks of life, live in every state, hold just about every job possible from pilots to doctors to bussiness persons, and are NORMAL PEOPLE. i don't make pentagram circles on my floor with candles, i don't worship satan, i don't slaughter cats, i don't chant and curse people, and most importantly: I DON'T PUSH MY RELIGION ON OTHERS!!!!! i respect others beliefs as just that, their beliefs. remember: judge not least ye be judged.",

   "sundowner-\n \ncan you show me a quote from the bible that speaks of witchcraft dirrectly? the bible also does not speak highly of the boy scouts, but i doubt they are the evil spawn of satan.\n\n Perhaps you could enlighten me of when I said that witches are the evil spawn of Satan. Thank you. I can tell you what the Bible says about other gods:\n \n \"And he made his sons pass through the fire in the valley of Ben-hinnom; and he practiced witchcraft, used divination, practiced sorcery, and dealt with mediums and spiritists. He did much evil in the sight of the Lord, provoking Him to anger.\" (Prov. 22:6). 2 Chron. 33:6\n \n Idol worship from the Bible's perspective: The second commandment talks about `Idols' and `Images', \"You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form {of anything} in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.\" (Exodus 20: 4) \n \n You shall not bow down to them; for I, the LORD your God, {am} a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and forth {generation} of those who hate me\" (Exodus 20: 5). \n \n When you look up to the sky and see the sun, the moon and the stars - all the heavenly array - do not be enticed into bowing down to them and worshipping things the LORD your God has apportioned to all the nations under heaven.\"(Deuteronomy 4: 19) \n \n 19 Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, \n 20 Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, \n 21 Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. (Galatians 5)\n \n \n \"Be careful to do everything I have said to you. Do not invoke the names of other gods; do not let them be heard on your lips.\" (Exodus 23:13) \n \n \"For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places\" (Eph. 6:12)\n \n As our defenses are dropped by our meddling curiosity, occult spirits can and will enter in and establish themselves. These are the spirits which travel to the third and fourth generations through the parents (inheritance) because consorting with them breaks the first commandment by contacting another god. A curse from God results. (Deuteronomy 18:9-12) and (Exodus 20:3-5) \n \n Some things have been made known to Christians through the Church, and The Bible. Do not attempt to tell me that Christianity is not against Witchcraft, Wicca etc. Had Jesus seen a witch, his reply and attitude would have been simple. He would hate their actions, but he would love them.\n \n Check my definitions on Witches. Plus, does Wicca not teach of several gods? Something Christianity does not believe in. Check those verses.\n [quote]but by your philosophy, anything not coming from god is a spawn of satan.\n \nbut by your philosophy, anything not coming from god is a spawn of satan.\n\n I'm sure that you will correct me if I am wrong, but when have I ever mentioned \"the spawn of satan.\" I think that you will find that I haven't. This statement is quite hilarious, while absurd. It is not simply \"My Philosophy.\" The entire Church is against Witchcraft etc.. do not even attempt to suggest otherwise.\n \ntequilla comes from mexico....does that mean the great prince of hell lives south of the border?\n\n What frivolities. Who suggested that \"tequilla is evil?\" What are you trying to say? Because it contains alchohol, you are assuming that it is evil?\n \nthen why do half the sects of the christian faith believe alcohol is \"evil\" and comes from satan.\n\n You might want to check your use of the word \"sect.\" Am I to assume that you mean \"denomination.\" Secondly, this is entirely incorrect. Not a single denomination states that \"alcohol is evil.\" The only denominations that are against alcohol, are places such as The Salvation Army, who CERTAINLY do not think that it is evil. Jesus drank alcohol. Perhaps you should practice what you preach, and stop being ignorant to Christianity.\n \nby this definition; christians, the christian church, jews, jesus and all other religious beliefs are cults. WHAT? jesus a cult? blasphemy! well, going by the definition, yes he is! but look at this realistically. The American Heritage Dictionary is a book, written by man...get my point?\n\n No!! Which one in particular are you going by? Notice the use of the word \"sect!\"\n \ni really liked your \"5 steps of a cult\" thing. made me laugh.\n\n Thank you, I'm glad.\n \nlastly, i must address one other point. you referred to Wiccans as women.\n\n Well, I don't remember saying that only women can be Wiccans. I do know that they can. \n \nI DON'T PUSH MY RELIGION ON OTHERS!!!!! \n\n Well, I haven't done this, and I haven't enforced it on anyone. I hope that you are not attempting to imply that I am.\n \njudge not least ye be judged.\n\n Who's judging?\n \n mizmax - Casting out demons is considered witchcraft? I think not.\n \nBesides which, there is no unity of Christianity either, or even agreement on the Bible.\n\n Then what do you make of the council of Churches?",

Sorry.\n \n \nSwords, colored robes, candles, and pentagrams of wiccans are as old (or older than) holy chalices, priests robes, er.. candles, and crosses. So what's your point?\n\n \n That magic etc, is practiced is so many cultures that to say you're a wiccan or a pagan or whatever, means very little with regards to any meaningful system of faith, because there's just so many different forms of practice and belief.\n \n \nAbout the Bible, no, there is no one compiled text, but there is no one Bible either. There are many different translations, and they include differing texts. \n\n \n There was one Bible. There was one Church. I can't help the fact that this is no longer the case, but as I said of paganism, there was never a unity. Each society, all around the world had their own set of gods.\n \n Like astrology. Somone might say \"Oh, I'm Virgo\", but in China, they had a different set of symbols, with different attributes. In South America, a totally different set again. So to say you believe in 'astrology', or 'paganism' is in itself devoid of meaning except that you hold some sort of belief somewhere, that is totally different from the beliefs of someone else who also labels themselves 'pagan'\n \n Which system of gods? How many gods? Why these and not say, the gods of the Hottentots, or the Maya, or the Dharuk etc.\n \n \nAt any rate, not having \"a book\" is not evidence of a lack of unity.\n\n \n I should think it was. The local aboriginal tribes, Cadigal, Dharuk etc, didn't have any literature relating to their gods. Also, they never had gods of wine, metal-work, ships etc, because they never had wine, metal-work, ships etc. So their system of gods is totally unlike that of the Romans, or the Celts, or the Norse, the Chinese, etc etc. And all these systems were pretty much unlike all the others too.\n \n \nYou don't seem to have done much research into wiccanism at all.\n\n \n You're right. I generally have little time for modern cultist myths. I do like mythology, and I do like fiction, but I don't ascribe any real spiritual significance to them... why not follow the beliefs of Star Trek: a world of progress, and toleration, hope for the future, etc. No money, everyone having all that they need",

   "I apologise in advance if i state something that's already been said. I didn't read all 7 pages of it, mostly cos i'm a lazy twat. Anyway - \n \n I've always heard Christians and Catholics say that if you have God in your Heart, it didn't matter what you did or what religion you followed. Obviously, this has major setbacks since you could say that a man who murdered and raped 1000 babies will go to Heaven just because he has God in his Heart. Now, if this was the case then this would mean that some of the most obscenely, nasty murderers would go to Heaven...because they believe and love God.\n \n Now, if you say that if you follow a different religion you are going to Hell, then that sort of condemns a Hell of alot of people. How would you like it if you (this goes to the Christians) died, floated on up to Heaven only to find out that your religion was not the \"correct\" one. I believe this is touched on in 'Southpark' and as much as i grow weary of its crude, childlike humour, it does have a good point. Stating that the majority of Christians persecute others because they believe that their God is the one, true God. Anyway, i digress...yes, how would you feel if you floated on upto Heaven, only to be turned away because that of what you were led to believe in, was false. And the true religion that you should have followed was some...other...one...yes.",

Obviously even by this silliness Adam wouldn't be having sex with his children to make more people, but anyway...\n \n I'll try and walk you through this. When Cain got condemned by God for killing his brother. God put a mark on his forehead (the 'Mark of Cain') that where ever he went, people would despise him. Quite clearly this is reference to other people. Just because they aren't named individually doesn't mean that they weren't there.

Judgment day is not for us to know the day. If you believe the Raelians, well and good, but what's the point in mentioning them. Are you suggesting that because the Raelians have claimed a date, and Christians haven't then Christianity is flawed. I'm only guess at what you actually mean, because there's very little continuity to your post. It's not writing, just typing.\n \n What's being masculine got to do with anything? Why did you even raise that? I must say, that the Orthodox Church doesn't approve of taking any mind altering drugs. So you probably should take heed before sitting at the keyboard again.",

Exact quote:\n \n \n \n Please explain in detail.\n\n \n I know I'm not Montalban, but if you don't mind, I can show you how to get sent to hell, or how easily you can get into heaven.\n \n All you have to do to get into hell is sin once. Everyone has sinned. The Bible says in Romans 3:23 \"For all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God.\" I believe that is pretty straight forward. It also says in Romans 3:10, \" As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:\"\n So as you can see, the Bible says that everyone sins, and that no one is righteous enough to get into heaven on their own. No sinners can get into heaven. But what about all the \"good things\" we do? The Bible says \"But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.\" in Isaiah 64:6. So what hope do we have? We have hope in Jesus Christ alone. Jesus himself said in John 14:6, \"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\" How do we get in to heaven? Look up 1 John 1:9. It says, \"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\" Who do we confess to? A preist? No. Even though when you have wronged someone, you should go to them and tell them you have wronged them and ask for forgiveness, true cleansing of sin comes from God the father alone. In Old Testament times, the way to be forgiven from sins was by way of sacrifice. The reason we don't have to do this anymore is because Jesus Christ was our one perfect sacrifice on the cross. He, unlike us, never sinned. The way He did this was because He was God in the flesh. He conquered death by rising up on the third day by His own power, which is something only God can do. Since He was God, he could do it, which guaranteed us eternal salvation. We confess our sins to God. The Bible says in 1 Timothy 2:5, \"For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;\" Another good verse also clarifies this. It is Romans 10:9. It says, \"That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.\" It is that simple. Baptism doesn't save you. It is merely a simbol of commitment to Christ. A perfect verse which tells us that we can't get to heaven by our own power is Titus 3:5. It says, \"Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;\"\n \n All you have to do to be saved is pray to God and ask Him to forgive you of your sins, believe that Christ paid the penalty for your sins (Romans 6:23) by dying on the cross and raising from the dead, and ask Jesus to come into your heart and be your Saviour. It's that simple. Then you can know you are on your way to heaven. I leave you with one final verse. 1 John 5:13 says, \"These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.\"\n \n I will pray for you that you do this, and I hope to see you in heaven when I die.

   "Stro777 takes the familiar Protestant line. One that is an innovation, rather than Christ's teaching.\n \n Protestants believe that to get to heaven you need only faith alone (sola fide - in Latin). This doctrine was created by Martin Luther who felt uneasy about Catholic traditions.\n \n When I say created, this is no idle usage of the word, because for 1,500 years, the Church (the early Church, then the Catholic and Orthodox churches that split c.1050) taught otherwise.\n \n To understand this mistake you can start with the life of Jesus. As an example, Jesus lead a perfect life. He lead a sacramental existence. He was a practicing Jews. He went to the Synagogue. He also partook in some non-traditional sacraments such as Baptism. He had the \"Last Supper\" at Passover; where he told His disciples to commemorate that night in memory of Him - He thus began a sacrament. His whole crucifixion was a sacrament - a sacrifice for us.\n \n Christ established His Church here on earth. For the Protestants to be correct, Jesus was mistaken, because He obviously chose disciples who misunderstood His message - because none of them taught 'faith alone'.\n \n As well, what little proof Protestants have comes from the Bible. This is the same book that the Church Christ established, put together.\n \n A Protestant logic must work like this...\n Thus Jesus picked men who didn't understand Him. The Apostles wrote a book that they didn't understand. They taught the opposite to the book that they didn't understand. They actively deceived people for 1,500 years, so that everyone went to hell (because they all practiced sacraments which Protestants believe take you away from God). Then, 1,500 years later Martin Luther remarkably finds where everyone went wrong all that time. He is smarter than the Apostles, because he understood Christ's message better than they did.\n \n Even non traditional people realise Luther split with previous teachings...\n \n McGrath on justification and regeneration Iustitia Dei, Vol. 1\n p. 182 \"Although Luther regarded justification as an essentially unitary process, he nevertheless introduced a decisive break with the western theological tradition as a whole by insisting that, through his justification, man is intrinsically sinful yet extrinsically righteous.\" \n \n p. 184 \"The significance of the Protestant distinction between justification and regeneration is that a fundamental discontinuity has been introduced into the western theological tradition where none had existed before. Despite the astonishingly theological diversity of the late medieval period, a consensus relating to the nature of justification was maintained throughout. The Protestant understanding of the nature represents a theological novum, whereas its understanding of its mode does not.\" \n \n p. 36 \"Augustine demonstrates of iustitia, effected only through man's justification, demonstrates how the doctrine of justification encompasses the whole of Christian existence from the first moment of faith through the increase in righteousness before God and man, to the final perfection of that righteousness in the eschatological city. Justification is about being made just.\"\n \n p. 185 \"The medieval period was astonishingly faithful to the teaching of Augustine on the question of the nature of justification, where the reformers departed from it.\"\n \n p. 186 \"The essential feature of the Reformation doctrines of justification is that a deliberate and systematic distinction is made between justification and regeneration. Although it must be emphasized that this distinction is purely notional, in that it is impossible to separate the two within the context of the ordo sautis, THE ESSENTIAL POINT IS THAT A NOTIONAL DISTINCTION IS MADE WHERE NONE HAD BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED BEFORE IN THE HISTORY OF CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE.

   "Stro777 takes the familiar Protestant line. One that is an innovation, rather than Christ's teaching.\n \n Protestants believe that to get to heaven you need only faith alone (sola fide - in Latin). This doctrine was created by Martin Luther who felt uneasy about Catholic traditions.\n \n When I say created, this is no idle usage of the word, because for 1,500 years, the Church (the early Church, then the Catholic and Orthodox churches that split c.1050) taught otherwise.\n \n To understand this mistake you can start with the life of Jesus. As an example, Jesus lead a perfect life. He lead a sacramental existence. He was a practicing Jews. He went to the Synagogue. He also partook in some non-traditional sacraments such as Baptism. He had the \"Last Supper\" at Passover; where he told His disciples to commemorate that night in memory of Him - He thus began a sacrament. His whole crucifixion was a sacrament - a sacrifice for us.\n \n Christ established His Church here on earth. For the Protestants to be correct, Jesus was mistaken, because He obviously chose disciples who misunderstood His message - because none of them taught 'faith alone'.\n \n As well, what little proof Protestants have comes from the Bible. This is the same book that the Church Christ established, put together.\n \n A Protestant logic must work like this...\n Thus Jesus picked men who didn't understand Him. The Apostles wrote a book that they didn't understand. They taught the opposite to the book that they didn't understand. They actively deceived people for 1,500 years, so that everyone went to hell (because they all practiced sacraments which Protestants believe take you away from God). Then, 1,500 years later Martin Luther remarkably finds where everyone went wrong all that time. He is smarter than the Apostles, because he understood Christ's message better than they did.\n \n Even non traditional people realise Luther split with previous teachings...\n \n McGrath on justification and regeneration Iustitia Dei, Vol. 1\n p. 182 \"Although Luther regarded justification as an essentially unitary process, he nevertheless introduced a decisive break with the western theological tradition as a whole by insisting that, through his justification, man is intrinsically sinful yet extrinsically righteous.\" \n \n p. 184 \"The significance of the Protestant distinction between justification and regeneration is that a fundamental discontinuity has been introduced into the western theological tradition where none had existed before. Despite the astonishingly theological diversity of the late medieval period, a consensus relating to the nature of justification was maintained throughout. The Protestant understanding of the nature represents a theological novum, whereas its understanding of its mode does not.\" \n \n p. 36 \"Augustine demonstrates of iustitia, effected only through man's justification, demonstrates how the doctrine of justification encompasses the whole of Christian existence from the first moment of faith through the increase in righteousness before God and man, to the final perfection of that righteousness in the eschatological city. Justification is about being made just.\"\n \n p. 185 \"The medieval period was astonishingly faithful to the teaching of Augustine on the question of the nature of justification, where the reformers departed from it.\"\n \n p. 186 \"The essential feature of the Reformation doctrines of justification is that a deliberate and systematic distinction is made between justification and regeneration. Although it must be emphasized that this distinction is purely notional, in that it is impossible to separate the two within the context of the ordo sautis, THE ESSENTIAL POINT IS THAT A NOTIONAL DISTINCTION IS MADE WHERE NONE HAD BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED BEFORE IN THE HISTORY OF CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE. A FUNDAMENTAL DISCONTINUITY WAS INTRODUCED INTO THE WESTERN THEOLOGICAL TRADITION WHERE NONE HAD EVER EXISTED, OR EVER BEEN CONTEMPLATED BEFORE. The Reformation understanding of the nature of justification - as opposed to its mode - must be regarded as a genuine theological novum.\" \n \n p. 182 \" Although Luther regarded justification as an essentially unitary process, he nevertheless introduced a decisive break with the western theological tradition as a whole by insisting that, through his justification, man is intrinsically sinful yet extrinsically righteous.\" \n http://matt1618.freeyellow.com/page5.html#PROTESTANT SCHOLAR ADMITS NO SOLA FIDE\n \n The problem with 'faith alone' extends beyond the fact it is not what Jesus taught. It is also logically flawed.\n \n a) If I have 'faith' and that is all I need, then it doesn't matter what I do. Therefore I could be a justified murderer... a case very well lampooned by James Hogg in \"Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner\" wherein he states that he can now be free to act in any way he wishes, because he is saved.\n b) What happens to a born-again Christian who converts to another faith, or becomes apostate?

   "Here is something I need you to answer.\n \n First off, how did the Old Testament Jews receive forgiveness of sins? They sacrificed animals. What did this sacrifice foreshadow? It was a symbol of the perfect Lamb of God, Jesus Christ being sacrificed for our sins. When Jesus came, died, and rose again, that was our perfect sacrifice for all sins. He died for every single sin in the world. When the Old Testament Jews brought a sacrifice before the high priest, they were accepting the forgiveness of their sins by faith because it had been promised to them. Wouldn't it then follow logic to accept the sacrifice of Jesus Christ by faith? Tell me please, if we need to do good works as well as accept the sacrifice of Jesus, does that mean that His sacrifice was enough to cover our sin and make us look perfect before God the Father? The price was already paid and the sacrifice had been completed for our sin. If we still need to do good works, then that is saying that Jesus didn't die for all the sins we will commit in the future. We all agree that a sinful person can't enter into heaven, correct? If then after we accept Christ and (as you say) we need to continue in good works to keep our salvation, would one sin just before we died send us into hell? I already accepted Christ as my sacrifice for all my sins. What else do I need to do? Now, do NOT think that I am saying we shouldn't do good works. If we truly belong to Christ, the Holy Spirit puts in us a desire to do good works. We should want to serve Christ if our faith is real. But the fact remains that we will sin until our death. The only way that we can enter into heaven then is by the blood of Christ covering our sin and nothing more.",

   "First off, how did the Old Testament Jews receive forgiveness of sins? They sacrificed animals.\n \n \n Actually, they did more than just sacrifice animals. Roots of the Catholic practice of confession can be found in the Old Testament. Catholics did not invent penance and confession. We do see the foreshadowing of Christianity in the Old Testament. The Old Testament religion of Judaism is perfected in the New Testament religion of Christianity. Look at Numbers 5:5-6 and Leviticus 5:5-6 and you will see that Catholic absolution and confession is biblical absolution and confession. You will find the essential elements of being forgiven in God's way, which is the Catholic way. One must confess, one must bring an offering or sacrifice (penance), and this offering is submitted to God through the priest. The change being made was that in Christianity one had to offer a sacrifice of one's self and an offering true and pure of heart. Hebrews 13:16, 1 Peter 2:5\n \n \nWhat did this sacrifice foreshadow? It was a symbol of the perfect Lamb of God, Jesus Christ being sacrificed for our sins. When Jesus came, died, and rose again, that was our perfect sacrifice for all sins. \n \n \n Agreed.\n \n \n \n He died for every single sin in the world.\n \n \n If the person accepts Christ's sacrifice then he did die for every sin. But some do not. We have the freedom to reject Christ and his sacrifice. (Hebrews 10:26-31, 1 Peter 2:16)\n \n Why does Jesus teach on hell if salvation is to be granted to everyone?\n \n \nWhen the Old Testament Jews brought a sacrifice before the high priest, they were accepting the forgiveness of their sins by faith because it had been promised to them.\n \n \n In faith through works. They had to take action and offer a sacrifice.\n \n \nWouldn't it then follow logic to accept the sacrifice of Jesus Christ by faith? \n \n \n Yes...and works. James 2: 14-26.\n \n \nTell me please, if we need to do good works as well as accept the sacrifice of Jesus, does that mean that His sacrifice was enough to cover our sin and make us look perfect before God the Father? The price was already paid and the sacrifice had been completed for our sin. If we still need to do good works, then that is saying that Jesus didn't die for all the sins we will commit in the future. \n \n \n Jesus Christ's sacrifice was all sufficient. All salvation comes through Christ and we have no power in effecting our own salvation initially until Christ calls us. But once he calls us and gives us grace, we must cooperate with him. Our sacrifice must be added to his because we are now members of his body. We must participate in the redemptive suffering of Christ. This is very clear in the following verses: Matthew 10:38, Romans 8:16-17, 2 Corinthians 5:20 and 6:1,Colossians 1:24, 1 Peter 2:21, 1 Peter 4:13.\n \n \nWe all agree that a sinful person can't enter into heaven, correct?\n \n \n Actually, we don't agree. \n \n You say that a sinful person does enter heaven. You say that sin is simply \"covered\" by Christ. \n \n Catholics say that a sinful person cannot enter heaven (Revelation 21:27, Matthew 5:48). We are purified and become a new creation. \n \n \n \nIf then after we accept Christ and (as you say) we need to continue in good works to keep our salvation, would one sin just before we died send us into hell?\n \n \n It depends on what the sin is.",

   "Quote:\n \n \"Actually, they did more than just sacrifice animals. Roots of the Catholic practice of confession can be found in the Old Testament. Catholics did not invent penance and confession. We do see the foreshadowing of Christianity in the Old Testament. The Old Testament religion of Judaism is perfected in the New Testament religion of Christianity. Look at Numbers 5:5-6 and Leviticus 5:5-6 and you will see that Catholic absolution and confession is biblical absolution and confession. You will find the essential elements of being forgiven in God's way, which is the Catholic way. One must confess, one must bring an offering or sacrifice (penance), and this offering is submitted to God through the priest. The change being made was that in Christianity one had to offer a sacrifice of one's self and an offering true and pure of heart. Hebrews 13:16, 1 Peter 2:5\"\n \n True, God does not want us to sacrifice if we have ought against our brother. Mat 5:23 says this. Those versus out of the Old Testament do not say that being reconciled has anything to do with the forgiveness of sins. In Lev 5:5-6 it talks about confessing the sin, but it does not say to whom. Titus 3:5-9 says, \"5 Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;\n 6 Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;\n 7 That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.\n 8 This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.\n 9 But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.\"\n \n That seems to clearly say that it is not by works, but by mercy and grace. It is also saying that since we are justified by grace, that we should continue in good works because they profit man. It says nothing here about being forgiven by works. It also says we are saved by faith and not works in Ephesians 2:8-9.\n \n Quote:\n \n \"If the person accepts Christ's sacrifice then he did die for every sin. But some do not. We have the freedom to reject Christ and his sacrifice. (Hebrews 10:26-31, 1 Peter 2:16)\n \n Why does Jesus teach on hell if salvation is to be granted to everyone?\"\n \n I agree completely. We have to accept the sacrifice. I'm sorry if that didn't seem to be clear by what I was saying, but I did say, \"...if we need to do good works as well as accept the sacrifice of Jesus...\"\n I used the words accept the sacrifice of Jesus many times. We have to accept it by faith.\n \n Quote:\n \n \"In faith through works. They had to take action and offer a sacrifice.\n \n Yes...and works. James 2: 14-26.\"\n \n Now, to go to James, you have to understand the history and meaning of the entire book. The early scholars almost did not let the book of James be inserted into the Bible because they thought it went against Paul's teachings. What James is saying throughout the entire book is not that works get you into heaven, but rather that if you do indeed have true faith, it will bring forth good works. The early scholars realized this and put it into the Bible. For example, when he talked of Abraham and Rahab and said how they professed to have faith and followed through with it by doing good works, their faith was proven. The Holy Spirit puts in us a desire to do that which is right. Robert G. Gromacki states, \"The general purpose of James was to exhort his readers to support with their lives what they said with their lips.\" The purpose of James was not to show that faith and works get you into heaven, but rather that true faith with bring forth works on its own.\n \n Quote:\n \n \"Jesus Christ's sacrifice was all sufficient. All salvation comes through Christ and we have no power in effecting our own salvation initially until Christ calls us. But once he calls us and gives us grace, we must cooperate with him. Our sacrifice must be added to his because we are now members of his body. We must participate in the redemptive suffering of Christ. This is very clear in the following verses: Matthew 10:38, Romans 8:16-17, 2 Corinthians 5:20 and 6:1,Colossians 1:24, 1 Peter 2:21, 1 Peter 4:13.\"\n \n Those verses never state anything of salvation or of forgiveness of sins. I do, however, agree with those verses completely because once we become a Christian and follow Christ's way, we will be persecuted and our life will be hard. We will suffer. As I said before though, those verses say nothing of salvation.\n \n Quote:\n \n \"Actually, we don't agree. \n \n You say that a sinful person does enter heaven. You say that sin is simply \"covered\" by Christ. \n \n Catholics say that a sinful person cannot enter heaven (Revelation 21:27, Matthew 5:48). We are purified and become a new creation.\"\n \n Well, actually what I was saying was that when Christ's blood covers our sin, God the Father sees the blood of Jesus when He looks at our lives, and, therefore, we can be clean. And by the way, we will receive a glorified body in heaven.\n \n Quote:\n \n \"It depends on what the sin is.\"\n \n What?? Where is that in scripture. The only unforgivable sin is not accepting the Holy Spirit. It doesn't matter which commandment we break. If we break one, we break them all. James 2:10 says this.\n \n I am not saying we should just accept Jesus and not do good works. I believe works are great. I don't believe that works save you. I do good works because Jesus wants me to. Side note: I was in no way glorifying myself in that statement. I was just trying to clarify my point that I believe in doing good works.

If you need further indication on whom you are to confess to then you can look at John 20:22-23, Matthew 18:18. You did see my latest posts to you on \"What's Wrong With Catholicism\" I trust?\"\n \n The first paragraph talks of the forgiveness of sins being through the priest. If you look at the passage you quoted, that was talking about the Old Testament priest. Who is our priest now? The Bible says in Heb 3:1 that Jesus is our Priest. Who makes the atonement for our sin now? Jesus does. He fills that position. We also aren't supposed to call anyone \"father\" except our God. Jesus says this in Matt. 23:9. If we go by who you say we are to confess our sins to in John 20:22-23 then I say we are in big trouble. He was talking to His disciples. They aren't here anymore. We confess our sins to God for forgiveness. The Bible says so in Romans 14:11-12. It even talks about this in the Old Testament in Psalm 32:5. Notice David didn't say he confessed his sins to a priest. He said, \"I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.\" Even he knew who to confess to.\n \n Quote:\n \n \"Ephesians speaks of works of the Old Testament law when taken in context. But we somewhat agree on the fact that grace is needed.\"\n \n Does it? In the New Testament there are two different Greek forms of \"works.\" The first (the one used in Ephesians is the same used every other place in the NT. The only one that is different is used in Matt 16:27. There it means \"to be better.\"\n \n Quote:\n \n \"And we can reject the sacrifice at any time and thus forfeit our salvation. There is no eternal security.\"\n \n This one was already answered by epaphras_faith.\n \n Quote:\n \n \"Of what early scholars do you speak? Martin Luther tried to throw James out of the Bible because it contradicted sola fide. But do you speak of any scholars prior to the Reformation?\"\n \n Well, I do know that the Catholic encyclopedia itself says, \"In the first centuries of the Church the authenticity of the Epistle was doubted by some, and amongst others by Theodore of Mopsuestia;\" Origen put it in the Bible in the second century.\n \n Quote:\n \n \"Matthew 10:34-42 does not speak of salvation? He who \"finds his life will lose it and he who loses his life for my sake will find it\"???\n \n Romans 8:16-17 does not speak of salvation? \"...we are children of God, and if children, then heirs, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified.\" What are we heirs to in Christ?

Maybe not but 2 Corinthians 5:21 right after it does. \"...we might become the righteousness of God.\"\n \n These verses (save Matt 10:34-42) talk about people who are already believers! They are already on their way to heaven. And I said before, \"once we become a Christian and follow Christ's way, we will be persecuted and our life will be hard. We will suffer.\" And when we accept Christ we are God's children. If you are your father's child, is there any way that you can un-be your father's child? No. You will always be your father's son. Likewise, once we are God's children, can we un-be His children? No. We can't be un-born.",

   "For further info\n \n The following is true of salvation:\n \n 1) God loves to the uttermost John 13:1\n 2) He purposes to keep in spite of everything John 10:28-30\n 3) He intends to present us faultless before Himself Jude 24\n 4) His Son ever lives to make intercession to keep us saved Heb:7:25 and 1John 2:1\n 5) His spirit has placed us into the body of Christ 1Cor 12:13\n 6) His spirit has sealed us until the day of redemption Eph 4:30\n 7) His word guarantees that nothing (including ourselves) can separate us from Christ Rom8:28-39\n Nowhere does the bible show that all of these works of God could be undone.\n \n Problems: 1) Hebrews 6:4-6 if this teaches loss of salvation it also teaches that it cannot be regained.\n 2) John 15:6 This probably refers to the judgement seat of Christ\n 3) James 2:14-26 Nonworking faith is not a faith that saves in the first place\n 4) 2Peter 2 and Jude are referring to false teachers who in Jude's estimation were not true believers (Jude 19 also see Rom 8:9)\n 5) Mat 24:13 End of what???? The great tribulation. See the context to verify.\n \n Over 200 times inthe NT Faith or belief is listed as the sole condition for salvation. \n \n Other additions such as surrender, baptism, repentence, and confession are a result of the work of salvation in us.\n \n I think this more sufficiently addresses the eternal security issue.",

   "I can only give a brief outline of the Orthodox viewpoint, because I have not read extensively on the subject... so must defer to other sources.\n \n \n \"In the western concept, hell is created by God to punish demons and sinners for eternity. The fire of hell is a created substance. The Orthodox doctrine is that of salvation. God?s love is all-encompassing. He loves all His creatures, men, angels, and demons. In His love He created them free to love God or not. To preserve our freedom, God?s love, His light and warmth, are given to each in a small portion. In the end however, God will not be restrained; His love and light will shine in all its brilliance. To those who have been purified and prepared it will be Paradise. To those who have rejected God, His light will seem as fire. Thus, hell is the unrestrained Uncreated Light misperceived by the evil. Again, Metropolitan Hierotheos puts this doctrine in its proper context. \"The deepest work of the Church is to cure man, to purify the nous [the deepest part of the soul] and the heart. After being purified man must acquire an illuminated nous in order to see God and in order that there may be Paradise and the Kingdom of Heaven for him.\" Once again the practical consequence of contemplating the doctrines surrounding life after death is to bring it back to repentance. Through ascetic practice and the sacraments of the Church we purify ourselves now to prepare for the vision of God?s light for eternity.\"\n \n http://www.theorthodoxreader.org/vol1998/reader_012.htm\n \n Orthodox believe that the gates of hell are locked from the inside, that is, you put yourself in there and shut the door by your refusal to join with God.\n \n To be God, is natural. To separate yourself from God is un-natural. However, the choice is yours.\n \n \n \" God did not create anyone for hell. It comes as a result of people choosing to consistently and irrevocably remain opposed to God in His love and wisdom. It is a terrible state.\"",

When I ask you about being a parent which was very relevant to my other question, you decline to answer because it&#8217;s a personal question as if that was going to reveal some deep secrete you were afraid of someone knowing. When someone talks about speciation, you can&#8217;t debate the process but want to sidetrack the issue by arguing the exact definition of species. Or when you bring up the issue of athletes then want to only discuss &#8220;football&#8221; athletes according to your definition. And even when I point out to you that my intent in using sarcasm is a way of joking around, you come back that no that&#8217;s not true because you get your feelings hurt so my intent has to be malicious. As if you could read my mind and tell what my intent was although you admit that YOUR intent was malicious.\n \n Because of this, I feel this is just a waste of my time. I don&#8217;t know if you are even interested or not but if you are, take a look at the thread &#8220;We are all monkeys&#8221; in the Creation vs Evolution section of the exchange between Ursus maritimus and I and you will see what I&#8217;m talking about. A good exchange of ideas without the name-calling, just information.\n \n Anyway I have no doubt you will disagree with everything I&#8217;ve said here but regardless of whether you believe me or not, I was never intentionally malicious. So good luck and I&#8217;ll catch you every once in a while.",

How could the oneness at any time existed without the opposite, the \"nothingness\"?\n \n If you say that the \"nothingness\" did exist, then you disprove god. Because then god's polar opposite existed either before him, or for as long as him.... If you say that the \"nothingness\" never existed, then you disprove god.

But since we're arguing about good and evil, I'll speak of them inside your perceptions.\n \n In order for there to be good, there must be evil.

I agree that \"evil\", in your sense of the word, is not a force at all. There's no true evil person in the world, no evil person that actively acts \"evil\" anyway. In everyone's perception, they are doing what they must. They are doing \"good\".\n \n However, you basically create the argument that one goes to hell for nothing. Everyone's idea of god is different. Everyone believes in god, but in different ways.... some think of god as science.... or as life in general.... maybe most people think of themselves as god.... and as such, whatever one thinks of as god, they think of as good. Can anyone truly campaign against god? No. No person can honestly violate their own code of conduct. Even when forced to make tough choices, the choices he or she make still fall under his or her own list of rules.\n \n \nThey are not polar opposites. Creating an option is just that; giving an opportunity - it doesn't create the result - just an option for that result.\n \n God didn't create His opposite. He created Lucifer and Lucifer chose rebellion. The option of rebellion was Lucifer's choice in exercising Free Will.\n\n \n So what you're saying is that your god created choices, options, freewill.... and didn't know where those choices would lead???? If he did, then he very readily created \"evil\".... if not, then he is not the all-powerful entity that you imagine. It almost cancels him out.\n \n \nYour argument rests on the assumption that you need both, as they are not opposites, this 'axiom' fails.\n\n \n Light and the absence of light are pretty much opposites, wouldn't you say? Good and evil are opposites, as well as god and no-god. If there was no god, then I wouldn't have a no-god belief. Likewise, if everyone believed in god, then there would be no god belief.\n \n Air. I believe air to be good. When in outer space, there is no air. That is bad. Let's never go to outer space, for it is evil. Now before I made that silly statement, there was no concept of air as being anything significant. It was not judged as good or bad, it simply was. You breathe without thinking, and yes, you're breathing air. Air doesn't really exist without the absence of it. Otherwise, air cannot be good. I have asthma. The only reason I know air is good is because I know what it feels like to have no air. You probably don't really know how good air is. You probably have never really thought of it as a big deal. But air is the most precious thing in existence to me (somewhat of an exaggeration, but you get the idea). Until you have no food, food is expected. It's not good or bad, it just exists.\n \n I knew nothing of positive and negative numbers for quite the few years in my schooling. Before I was taught the concept of positive and negative numbers in, say, the sixth grade, there was no notion of such things.... two minus eight was just zero. But as words and concepts, both ideas exist simultaneously. Even before I was taught of them, someone came up with the concept of having positive and negative numbers.... and neither part can exist without the other. A negative is defined as below the range of positive numbers, below zero. A positive is, likewise, all numbers that aren't negative, those above zero. You can't have positive numbers without negative numbers.... even though the numbers I dealt with prior to the sixth grade were all positive, they were just the only way. There was no opposite. My perception was that numbers were numbers. I didn't realize there were the opposites of positive and negative.\n \n Without some way to describe the lack of something (an opposite) or some way to judge the goodness or importance of something (an opposite), you have no argument. God can't be good, because there can be no existence without god.... god [b]is existence.\n \n \nRight is right. Your opinion of what is right might be different.\n\n \n Right is an opinion. You said my opinion may be different. And since all opinions are different, obviously there is no one right way.... (and consequently, no one true church;))\n \n \nYour dualistic approach falls down here too as something in terms of law can be many things, legal, criminal, de-criminalised, plus something unlegislated in any respect.\n\n \n Exactly. Law is not an absolute concept. It is argued upon. People have different notions of lawful. But for any notion of lawful to exist, there must be behaviors that would be deemed unlawful. Otherwise, what's the point of having laws in the first place?\n \n For any one way to exist, there has to be the other way, the opposite path. Otherwise, it's not a path, a choice, or an option. Without evil, there is no choice to be with god. There is only being with god. If evil is not god's opposite, then there is no hell. If there is evil, then god and evil are \"opposing\" forces (not that they clash, per se, just that they are equal and opposite ideas).\n \n \nI'm not sure that the universe is infinite. But again, I must point out that good and evil aren't equals at opposite ends of the spectrum.\n\n \n Unless you can name a boundary, the universe is infinite, at least to mere men. And you can look at it two ways: good and evil are indeed opposites, or good and evil are not opposites.\n \n (Let's say that good=god and evil=devil, just to give the two forces names.)\n \n If they are, in fact, opposite forces, that means that each has equal pull. This creates two givens:\n 1) Since both have equal pull, each is right in its own way. This means that the \"absence of god\" is not hell-bound, but rather, just not allowed to enter god's \"heaven\". Perhaps god's \"hell\" is the devil's \"heaven\". And if the devil's way is good to some, it totally throws a wrench in the notion that good is absolute. If good is not absolute, then god cannot be \"good\" in an absolute sense, and the devil cannot be \"evil\" likewise. Therefore, perception rules the land, and we enter either god's \"heaven\" or perpetual worship, or we enter the devil's \"heaven\" of self-gratification. It's up to each person to decide which is good and evil to him.\n 2) Each exists because of the other. Remove the devil, and you have no real god, and vice versa. How? If there's no opposite choice, there's no \"cause\" to exist for. After all, what is god's \"message\" other than be good to your fellow man and follow my rules? If there is no opposite of following the rules and being good, what is there left to do? A paradox exists. And because god and the devil are intrinsically linked to one another, neither could have existed before the other. Therefore, your god is not all-powerful, as the devil is an equal force and holds some influence and ability.\n \n Fine and dandy, you say, but that was just a bunch of XXXX! Good and evil are not opposites! God is still supreme!\n \n Since you don't think good and evil are opposing forces, then they must both be of god. I mean, unless evil is of a malevolent antagonist (the devil), then it must be of god's creation, and of god. God created everything.... including evil, the absense of himself. You cannot deny this. A being, such as your god, with unlimited power and unrivaled omniscience knows everything, including what choices you'll make and where they will lead. If god is truly the force Christians claim he is, then god created freewill with the full knowledge of what would happen. He had to create the option for people not to believe in him. It couldn't just randomly happen, and the devil didn't create anything. Just god. So god, in creating freewill, created the option for man not to follow god, and in doing so, god essentially had to create hell. God is simultaneously the good and evil. How powerful is that???\n \n But if all things are god, how can you ever truly turn away from him? Are not all choices god? Evil is a creation of god. If god is good, and if all things god has created are good, and evil is god's creation, then evil must be good. And if good is good, and evil is good, there is really no opposite of choosing good. If there is no opposite of choosing good, since by choosing to turn from good, you're still turning to good, then where is hell? Without an opposite to god/good, there is only god/good. There is no absence of god. Ever. Since hell is the self-inflicted punishment for choosing the absence of god, which doesn't exist, then hell, in turn, now without any true definition or purpose, ceases to exist.\n \n \nI only repeat what I understand to be God's Will.\n\n \n Key: \"what I understand to be\"\n \n Again, perception is what tells good from evil.\n \n \nIf you think that good and evil are polar opposites, dependent on each other -then aren't they absolutes? Your idea of what is good or bad might be different, but you are saying that 'good' and 'evil' exist anyway.\n\n \n Okay, let's do this two ways:\n 1) Good and evil are perceptions. They are absolutes in reference to the scale of good and evil. There are levels of goodness and evil in every action and individual in the eyes of the beholder. They are ideals by which all things are measured. Could there be, to some, an absolute example of good or evil? I imagine so, yes. But in terms of the universe, can there be absolutes of good and evil? No. Why? Because perception is only true to the perceiver. Opposites in ideal, yes.... but opposites as the irrefutable truth? No.\n 2) There are holes in both the idea of polar opposites and in there not being polar opposites. I argue both, since to you, they're the only two options. I mean, they are, after all, opposites. LOL. If two things are opposites, that creates equal duality. Which disproves god as all-powerful, and disproves hell as absolute, since there are two perceptions of what good and evil are. See above. If two things are not opposites, then they must be of the same thing. Example: if ugly and beautiful are not opposites, then they must be the same thing: perceptions of appearance. And if there is no absolute ugly (being that in this example, ugly and beautiful are not opposites) fighting against an absolute beautiful, all things must just appear when it comes to absolutes. No absolute ugly or beautiful, just absolute existence. Same with good versus evil. There is no absolute good or absolute evil, just absolute existence. And absolute existence, by the way, is just my way of saying there is no opposite, simply that there is (i.e. you cannot not exist).\n \n \nWhy wouldn't an omnipotent being be able to judge you? How does it guarantee salvation?\n\n \n The all-knowing being created options for mankind. Freewill. Gave them a complex brain with which to view and interpret the world. This being understood that each perception of life would be different. With me so far? It gave men reason and instinct and logic. The all-seeing force watches the world through our eyes.... knows why we choose what we choose. Thus, this all-understanding god must understand why any man would disbelieve in him. But still, you claim, this wise god would think itself the only truth, give men the option to turn from this \"truth\", and would even go so far as to allow men to enter hell because they chose one of the options god gave them? This being sounds to me like no all-powerful, all-seeing, all-knowing god. It sounds like a pompous XXX that would allow his own children to suffer because they failed to see their creator's glory.\n \n A truly omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent force would know that all things were created by him, and thusly, would know what whatever choice man made, it was a choice of god.\n \n \nIf your god is as powerful, all-knowing, and all-seeing as you want to believe, you and your Bible sell the dude short like a mutha****a\n\n \nExplain?\n\n \n I just did. You seem to think this god of yours is some random ego with powers beyond anything imaginable. You make \"god\" sound like some teenager who, in a megalomaniacal fit, created little insects to worship him. Your \"god\" is just an \"I\" that needs a little ego-stroking. Either that or he's some cocky little pop-star who thinks his XXXX is solid gold, so he created little fans to lick his ego some more. Any singular entity that would have a singular will, a singular plan, a singular code of conduct.... that would then allow people to screw up and choose the wrong one.... only so he could reward those who wanted to worship him for eternity.... any entity like that is no god. It's just attributing the qualities of an earthly king, one who would bully dissenters, to an intangible force. A mere personification. And a bad one, at that.\n \n All things are god. God is no \"entity\". God is all entities. That's why I say that I'm god. You're god. A fly is god. Hell, a damn busstop is god. God is the whole of everything. There is no singluar will or thought. There is all will and all thought. I know you still think I'm an idiot.... but that's the only truth there can be-that everything is god.\n \n And I only hope your egomaniac of a god does you well, because it doesn't sound like he's too nice of a guy. :(",

   "Good and evil are opinion words. Outside from our perceptions, they do not exist. But since we're arguing about good and evil, I'll speak of them inside your perceptions.\n\n \n In your opinion they are. Good exists whether I have an opinion about it or not. Even you must agree with this. All you are arguing here is what I define as being good is different, not that good does exist. And, therefore, if you accept that good exists, whether people believe in it or not, then you must try to act 'good'.\n \n \nIn order for there to be good, there must be evil. Otherwise, good doesn't exist, it simply becomes the status quo. Nothing special. Just like if there was no light, the absence of light would be the standard. Light wouldn't exist, so there could be no \"darkness\", for the lack of light would be without description.\n\n \n There is no force of darkness. It only exists because of there being no light. Light doesn't exist where there is no darkness! Light has an existence. Darkness is not existence.\n \n \nThat's the first intelligent thing I've heard from you yet! I agree that \"evil\", in your sense of the word, is not a force at all. There's no true evil person in the world, no evil person that actively acts \"evil\" anyway. In everyone's perception, they are doing what they must. They are doing \"good\".\n\n \n Then you have contradicted yourself with your analogy about light and darkness. Now you don't think good and evil are polar opposites/ of equal but opposite power.\n \n People can be given over to evil. I never said otherwise, they have turned away from good. It is not a force because goodness continues to exist whether they are evil or not. You can experience evil by shutting out the good. This isn't to say that it's the equal to good.\n \n \nHowever, you basically create the argument that one goes to hell for nothing. \n\n \n I made no such claim.\n \n \nEveryone's idea of god is different.

It is not a force because goodness continues to exist whether they are evil or not. You can experience evil by shutting out the good. This isn't to say that it's the equal to good.\n\n \n Look-when you have two choices, they can be one of three ways:\n a) One choice created from another. Let's say you're driving down the road of life, and you come upon a veering path-you can go straight, or turn left. Both are options of road. At one point, there was only one choice of road, but from that one path, another had begun.\n b) Two separate choices. You're driving down that same road, and suddenly, you realize that there is another road parallel to the one you're on. It is completely independent and equal to the road you're on. It is the opposite of your road, as you can only choose one, and they don't really connect. Since one road didn't veer or merge from the other, it's logical to assume that both roads started separately of each other. Therefore, one did not create the other.\n c) All choices are together. You're driving instead down a multilane highway. You can freely switch lanes, but no matter what, the lanes are connected, although each is a different lane entirely.\n You cannot have:\n d) Two unrelated ideas as choices. Let's say you're driving down the road of life. And the road is good. Evil would be.... not driving? So evil is lack of existence.... the opposite of life. Anyone who does not exist is evil because they choose not to exist and drive toward god. LOL\n \n \nI made no such claim [that people go to hell for nothing].\n\n \n I never said you claimed such a statement, but in your argument, this is a condition. If god created all things, and all things are of god, can one truly separate god from anything? No-because god is everything. Thus, god sends people to hell for no reason, for there is no opposite of god.\n \n If you want to argue the other side of that, that god can be separate from everything, then the choice of no-god is equal to the choice of god.\n \n You can't have two things that are opposite which are not equal. Light is the opposite of and is equal to darkness, for example.\n \n So then what do people go to hell for? Choosing an alternative route to god? I mean, good is subjective, and in god's all-knowing, all-seeing, all-powerful eyes, all of his creation must be good. Did god ever create something bad afterall? \n \n \nDo you believe God exists? I thought you didn't.\n \n If you want the answer to this apparent conundrum - about different views of right and wrong -read Romans Chapter 2.\n\n \n I've said it before; I believe in everything. What you call \"god\" is the universal consciousness, which makes up all things in existence. We're all parts of the same grand whole.\n \n \nGod created us, and knows that some of us will fail. Yet He loves us so much that He created us anyway.\n\n \n First off, he created the choice to fail.... and not just to fail, but to suffer eternally for that failure. Well, that would be loving if we were allowed to learn from our mistakes.... but as far as I knew, once you went to hell, you were to suffer for all of eternity. So how loving is that really? To create the absence of yourself(?!), create a being that you know will diss you for that absence, and even though you love it, he will just burn and smolder in hell for eternity.... I think that's god playing the roles of devil and god at once.\n \n But you know what? That sounds funny. God had to create the absence of himself, since, afterall, the Christian god is eternal. And if he created the absence of himself and someone chose that option.... isn't that still choosing god????\n \n Weird argument you're spouting, eh?\n \n \nEvil, is the denial of good. I thought I made that clear.\n\n \n Right, the denial of god/good. Denial was created by god. Unless someone else created denial.... or unless someone else created the absence of god/good....\n \n \nNow you've changed back again. Light is a force. Darkness is the absence of that force. Darkness is not a force. You can perceive darkness, but it only exists where there is no light.\n\n \n Right. But since god was not created and is eternal, he would have had to create an absence of himself.... and even that absence is part of god, as it is his creation....!\n \n \nI've no idea of what to say to this. I've been making a conscious effort to avoid saying anything sarcastic. This tract of yours has provided me with the greatest of temptations.\n\n \n I truthfully have asthma. And my example is applicable to the argument.\n \n Evil must exist for good to exist. If there was no option to turn away from god, god would be the only choice. And when something is the only choice, it's not a choice. It just exists. If there was no evil, good would not be good. There would be nothing to rate good against. That's all I'm saying.\n \n And if the choice is between good and evil, and there is no real \"evil\", then there is no choice. There is simply existing.\n \n \nI'm sorry that I've not responded to any more of your post\n \n See above\n\n \n Aw, bitter because I make more sense than you?\n \n You seem to think that single halves of opposite pairs can exist by themselves. God doesn't need evil to be good.... the universe isn't boundless.... You also think that there's a set-in-stone, uniform way to perceive things.... that there's an absolute goodness outside of men's perceptions.... a standard opinion that's true, and if you don't believe in this opinion, you're wrong.... and possibly evil. Then you think that god can simultaneously be everything and yet be absent for some.... that even though your god is infinite, he is finite. You believe things that, by their very definitions, could not be.\n \n I think you need to head back to square one.\n \n Your perception of the universe is very shaky.... I suggest you work out the details independently of mankind's feeble attempts. They've clearly led you astray. emoticon_frazzled \n \n *****\n \n All the towers, they fall.",

Would you create a place where your children were tortured for eternity?\n\n \n Just for the record.....Mont, sorry, he did specify he was talking to me. \n \n Hank: Your question is a good and valid one. First, I don't have children myself but have many friends who are children whom I love deeply. \n \n Would I create a place for them to be tortured for all eternity. No, I don't think I would. Now to the real issue. I don't see hell as a place where people are tortured for eternity. I see it as rejection from the presence of God. Silent Poet may have been fairly accurate in his discription of hell as non existence. I cannot think of anything worse than not being able to be with the one I love dearly, God. \n \n I believe that God created man with a choice. That choice is to be with God or not. Simple. For that choice to exist both possibilities must be real. Just like He created man with the choice to obey Him or not. God did not create sin (disobedience) he created the opportunity for it. If he did not then it would not be obedience. \n \n Now before anyone goes to far afield. I am not saying that Disobedience leads me into sin and destruction. I am saying that I am created with the choice. I have a nature that tends to sin. I have the choice of depending on God to live day to day. I say I have a nature that tends to sin because we have to teach our children to behave correctly. We do not have to teach them to behave incorrectly, that comes naturally. \n \n One of my dearest friends is currently in Juvy. His parents were essentially non existent and he learned that he could do what he wanted and his parents did not care. His father even told him that he could do what he wanted as long as he didn't get caught. This is not a perfect analogy but it gets my point across. My friend needed to be taught how to live rightly. By rightly, I mean to live out of who God created him to be. The phrase God didn't make junk is correct. However, he did make all of us with the need to be dependent on others and mostly to be dependent on God. My belief is that I cannot behave the way that God would declare righteous, not by myself. But, by trusting God and giving the results of my behavior over to Him, I can live radically in obedience. Not out of fear of going to Hell, but out of love and trust of the one who made me. \n \n That is what I believe about the creation of hell and its consequences.",

I'm not talking about disobeying you as my children do that now. But just the possibility of them never seeing you again?\n\n \n I wish I could say I would. I am not God and I know who I am. I would likely screw it up. I think God HAD to make the choice. God above all wants to love and to be loved. Love, by it's very nature cannot be commanded. I once read an Isaac Asimov series (The foundation series). In it there is a mutant which comes out of all of the ensuing garbage of the fall of the empire. It is a statistical abberation and could not have been accounted for by the foundation. He has the power to command people to obey him and to make them \"like him.\" There is one who is not under his influence. He is the one that works for him voluntarily. When asked why the mule replies \"People who love out of who they are will always work harder for you than those forced to.\"\n \n The point is that Love cannot be coerced or commanded. God wants his children to love him. He will not force it. The christian theology is that Adam's original sin caused man to fall into a state where sin came naturally. Through Jesus, men now have the choice to choose God again. (The doctrine holds true in both directions in time, but that is a much bigger discussion). At some point, Jesus will come again to claim his own and when we are in heaven, for the first time, we will be removed from even the presence of sin. I think the choice to be obedient will have already been made by the time we get to heaven, so I think it will be irrelevant.\n \n That I think also answers your following question.\n \n \nInteresting comment.

If so, doesn't that make God less loving that a human father?\n \n Why do you think it's either heaven or hell? As humans, we don't use the death penality for every infraction.

God is the reason for everything. He created.\n \n If I can use an analogy :) Adolf Hitler was directly responsible for a great many evils. However; if his mum and dad hadn't had him, he'd have never existed, so that they can in a sense, be held responsible for the creation of that evil being; however, that only the decision of Adolf Hitler makes for the direct creation of evil\n \n In a similar way, God created Satan. Satan is directly responsible for his own actions, but you could, if you were mean minded; blame God - because God knew that Satan would go against Him, and yet still created him.\n \n However God created Satan out of an act of love. God gave him free will. Satan's direct action of disobedience was his own choice. God did not force Satan to rebel. Satan's own wish to be apart from God was the direct result of evil.\n \n God could have just not created us at all. But out of love, He did.\n \n He wanted us to be more than just amoral beings. So out of love He gave us a choice, to come back to Him of our own Free Will, or not.\n \n It is a mystery, you could say that God still went ahead. I don't have that much love in me that I'd consider doing that; if I could.\n \n \n \n Another writer on these posts is full of vile\n I say: \"We are afraid that people will laugh at us. So what? It's OK to suffer for Christ. Evil is afraid of good word and laughs at it. Our good words are a creative power similar to the power of the God-Word. Like the power of God, it overcomes evil....Don't be afraid to say a good word...\"\n http://www.fatheralexander.org/booklets/english/spirtual_life_sergius_prague.htm\n \n This is directly relevant. No one is forcing the abuse to which I am enduring, but this writer chooses to do evil; because it amuses him. Out of Free Will he chooses to act, and his choice is continually one of evil and ignorance, ridicule and hate. People have a choice, and when they choose the bad, it is of their own doing.",

If they were, and they could see what Hitler would grow up to be, than their choice to have him would be an informed decision, and they would share the responsibility for his actions. Responsibility requires power, and the all-powerful is equally all-responsible.\n \n \nHowever God created Satan out of an act of love. God gave him free will. Satan's direct action of disobedience was his own choice. God did not force Satan to rebel. Satan's own wish to be apart from God was the direct result of evil.\n\n \n Where did the evil come from? You said earlier that evil was to darkness what God is to light, or heat. Therefore evil is the absence of God. If so, how can it exist at all? How can anything exist without God? Unless someone else created this other way of being- in which case God is not the only Creator.\n \n \nPeople have a choice, and when they choose the bad, it is of their own doing.\n\n But where does the \"bad\" come from? Objects exist without light, we just can't see them with our eyes. This is where that analogy breaks down- without God there isn't just darkness, there would be nothingness. In nothingness is not evil, nothingness is nothingness. Unless evil was a seperate force of it's own, like magnetic poles. If the good/evil dichotomy were like opposite magnetic forces, neither would be better than the other, they would be equal choices. Also, something would have to have created the other force- if not God, who?",

   "Okay but I'm not clear about this.\n \n \n \n It sounds like you are saying you would have a hard time doing it because you would love your children so much, but you would like to be able to because you think that is what God did and you think that is the right thing to do. If so, doesn't that make God less loving that a human father?\n \n Why do you think it's either heaven or hell? As humans, we don't use the death penality for every infraction. Maybe I'm strange but for a long time I have believed that the God I worship is at the very least as loving as I am. And I just couldn't seperate my children from myself no matter what they had done.\n\n \n The difference is Hank, that I accept that God is love. He defines what love is, I don't. I would like to do what I said. But, that would not in reality be loving. NOt given that God is love and that he knows better what love is than I do. It would be very arrogant of me to look at God, the creator of the universe, all powerful, full of mercy and grace and truth, the one who laid the foundations of the world and the heavens (stars etc.), who created DNA and RNA and bound them in histone proteins that are coiled and put miles of DNA within a single cell of microscopic proportions, and say that I know better what love is. The pot does not say to the potter, I am made wrong. This is what I believe. I also realise that as a limited human that my desires are not always for what is the best, but rather for what I THINK is the best. How do I know! I cannot see backward and forward in time, I cannot examine every detail of every person at once.\n \n The answer I am giving you is roughly the same answer that Job was given when God answered him out of the whirlwind.\n \n I hope this explains me a bit.",

I hope he knows God better for the discussion, as I do those that read it, but that is not my purpose. My purpose is to respond honestly about myself.\n \n I did not remove experience from my life.

I am simply stating what is reality.\n \n I am not debating this topic. I think I said that at the first. If I didn't then I think the context of questions and answers indicate that.

   "How quickly you forget. You berate me for interjecting. Then demand that I should have answered the question. Just look at what you've said a few paragraphs ago. Did you want me to reply or not? \n\n \n I did not demand that you answer the question. I demand an apology! GIVE ME MY APOLOGY! WAAAAAAAA LOL\n \n I get a kick out of what you say, but you don't answer the questions that are asked. There is a difference between replying and answering a question. So when I say you didn't answer the question I asked, that was true. When I say I like to read what you reply, that is also true. \n \n \nI did too. I said it was irrelevant. Then you harped on about 'did God create Hell?'\n I answered it too. \n\n \n I did not harp. I don't play ANY musical instruments. :)\n \n \nI asked you a question. So what? This is\n a) a public forum; I'm allowed to ask you questions\n\n \n Yes you are. But all your questions are irrelevant. :)\n \n \nb) you still didn't answer it.\n You've still got to make up your mind whether you're wanting to make a conversation with me or not. \n\n \n I gave up on having a rational debate with you a long time ago. You appear to have a good mind but unfortunately you are incapable of have a conversation with someone that disagrees with you because you are so defensive.\n \n Anyway I've forgotten what the irrelevant question was. LOL\n \n \nYou do attack my person. Again you've got a problem with English conversation. You attack my beliefs, you attack me. \n\n \n That's not a problem with English, it's a cultural misunderstanding. After twenty years of martial arts training and living in Texas where everyone carries a 12 gage in their rear window pickup rack, we apparently attach a different meaning to 'attack my person'. LOL\n \n \nYou would. As you have a lack of ability to grasp what is generally considered funny. You think making fun is funny. That's just cruel, not fun. \n\n \n You really miss a lot by not getting Saturday Night Live. Last week they had a skit on an interview with the Democratic candidates for president. It was very sarcastic but also very funny. The guy that played Chris Matthews was a riot. I laughed my head off.\n \n Hey my wife thinks our kidding around is funny.\n \n \nStill didn't stop you name calling did it? You seem to have admitted some confusion here. That's a first step. The first step to wisdom is to realise just how little you know.\n\n \n You are such a sensitive guy.\n \n If the first step to wisdom is to realize how little I know, I've been on the second step for a long time. BTW what's the second step? I might be an advanced student. LOL\n \n \nThat's not what you were harping on about anyway. You wanted to know if God created hell. If you actually could make up your mind about what you want to discuss, and with whom, that would help. \n\n \n I told you I don't play musical instruments. (Actually I do play a little keyboard but I don't think that counts as really playing something. Certainly not a harp.) And didn't I also tell you that we don't have discussions. You just don't listen to me.\n \n \nYou need help. I'm still prepared to give it. If you are confused about who you want to speak to, berate them for answering, and ignoring their answers, and their questions - you need help. \n\n \n That's the second time you've offered to help and haven't come through. I've been waiting with my pencil and pad right here the whole time. I'm beginning to think you are not really serious about helping me.\n \n \nAnother personal attack, although oblique.\n\n \n I resent that. If that wasn't a direct personal attack then I don't know what else to say. LOL\n \n \nWould you care to answer the question I raised? I think not. \n\n \n Sure but I don't remember the question so you'll have to ask it again.\n \n \nNo, they are offensive, rude and cruel. But I'm here to help you. You need to work through this dark period of your life. You've confused cruelty with funny. You need help. \n\n \n Montalban you are hurting my feelings now. Third time offer, but no cigar. You're not really serious about helping me are you?\n \n \nSO, not only do you think sarcasm and cruelty are funny, you must now think that they are endearing too? Take a little time to think about what you say. \n\n \n No, No, endearing is people liking me because I'm a nice person. My being funny is just a perk.\n \n \nYou mean you object to me checking facts? Do you want facts? Don't tell me you're upset by this too. Dear oh dear, I see we've got a lot of work to get through.\n\n \n I don't think I could ever understand why someone would look to other men for information about God instead of going directly to the Holy Spirit. Like all men in power, they are fallible and have an agenda, and will work, whether consciously or unconsciously to maintain that agenda.\n \n \nAlso you say that I can't respond to this topic, if I don't have children - but epaphras_faith says he has none. You are full of bile towards me by demanding that I butt out - being unqualified to answer.\n\n \n This is an interesting comparison and the first thing I thought of when epaphras responded to the question was the deference between my conversations with him and with you. I'm not at all surprised that you would bring it up. I was going to address it myself but you asked first. It is a chance for you to learn something but I doubt you will take it as a learning opportunity. \n \n When I asked you if you had children, your response was a curt, 'I'm not answering a personal question'. Of course it was pretty transparent that you didn't have children or you would have answered. As I said before, almost everyone is proud of their children. When epaphras answered, he informed me that he didn't have children but explained that he could empathize enough to answer the question because he had friends with children that he was very attached to. That was a perfectly acceptable answer that any reasonable person would accept.\n \n However that is just an example of how we interact, not the reasons behind how we interact. Epaphras and I have had several discussions and they have all been civil. He reminds me of my best friend at work who has major disagreements with me over religious beliefs. But he is probably the best person I know and a dedicated Christian. In fact our beliefs about how we see God and how we should treat our fellow man are very similar, even though our theology couldn't be much different. As a result I have respect for his beliefs. And we often discuss religious issues while never having the debate degrade into name-calling or even ill feelings. Epaphras and I interact in a very similar manner. I have a lot of respect for his beliefs, even though I don't agree with him, and I assume he has the same for mine, even thought I know he doesn't agree with them. But the big difference is, neither of us get defensive and let the debate degrade into ridiculing each other, something I asked you not to do at the very beginning.\n \n \nI only have time and understanding for you despite your irrational hate.\n\n \n Now why do you say tacky things like that Montalban? I can't think of anyone I hate, much less someone I spend as much time talking to as I do with you. My wife even knows I enjoy talking to you as we often laugh about our conversations. You just don't appreciate my humor. But if you don't ruin your health getting so bent out of shape about our conversations, you'll come to like me as much as I like myself. :)",

Obviously you feel that such things are endearing.\n \n This is why you have singled me out of all other Christians to claim that I believe in two gods. You've not asked this of others - nor tried to poke fun at them. I hope you come to realise these foibles.\n \n If you would answer my questions anyway, that would be cool.

God loves not only those who dwell in Paradise, but also those who are in Hell; in Hell, however, the Divine love constitutes a cause of suffering for the wicked. This is not due to God's love but to their own wickedness, which resents this love and experiences it as a torment. I believe that, as yet, neither Paradise nor Hell has commenced in a complete and perfect sense. What the reposed undergo now is the partial judgment, and partial reward and punishment. Hence, for the present, there is also no resurrection of the bodies of the dead. The saints, too, await this eternal and perfect state (even as a \"perfect\" and everlasting Hell awaits the sinners), for, in his Epistle to the Hebrews, St. Paul states, \"and these all (i.e., all the saints), having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise, since God has provided some better thing for us, so that they without us should not be made perfect\" (Heb. 14:40). \"\n http://www.fatheralexander.org/booklets/english/doctrine_ext.htm",

   "montalban, you still haven't responded to my post...\n\n \n My apologies, because I'd sent you a PM I'd forgotten not to send a reply to the forum. Thank you for the reminder\n \n \nAdolf Hitler was directly responsible for a great many evils. However; if his mum and dad hadn't had him, he'd have never existed, so that they can in a sense, be held responsible for the creation of that evil being; however, that only the decision of Adolf Hitler makes for the direct creation of evil\n\n \n \nExcept that Hitler's parents aren't omnipotent, omnipresent, and omniscient. If they were, and they could see what Hitler would grow up to be, than their choice to have him would be an informed decision, and they would share the responsibility for his actions. Responsibility requires power, and the all-powerful is equally all-responsible.\n\n \n Yes there are differences between my analogy, and the real situation with God - analogies are only aproximations. Not only is God omnipotent, he is full of Love. Although He foresaw evil, He also foresaw good. God still created you. Because of His infinite Love, He still created us with Free Will. If He was a nasty God, He could have just made us robot-like as toys to play with. His creation of you is not evil; you are a good person. There is good in it everywhere. If you only concentrate on the bad, I can't help that. That there is bad all around you - would you still have preferred non-existence - do you wish you'd never been born? I don't.\n \n \n However God created Satan out of an act of love. God gave him free will. Satan's direct action of disobedience was his own choice. God did not force Satan to rebel. Satan's own wish to be apart from God was the direct result of evil.\n\n \n \nWhere did the evil come from? You said earlier that evil was to darkness what God is to light, or heat. Therefore evil is the absence of God. If so, how can it exist at all? How can anything exist without God? Unless someone else created this other way of being- in which case God is not the only Creator.\n\n \n My analogy of closing your eyes to the light I think works. The light continues to shine on around you, but you've cut yourself off from it.\n \n I don't know the exact instance with regard to the Devil. As to Adam + Eve they were given a choice - re: tree of knowledge. They took the wrong option.\n \n \nPeople have a choice, and when they choose the bad, it is of their own doing.\n\n \n \nBut where does the \"bad\" come from? Objects exist without light, we just can't see them with our eyes. This is where that analogy breaks down- without God there isn't just darkness, there would be nothingness. In nothingness is not evil, nothingness is nothingness. Unless evil was a separate force of it's own, like magnetic poles. If the good/evil dichotomy were like opposite magnetic forces, neither would be better than the other, they would be equal choices. Also, something would have to have created the other force- if not God, who?\n\n \n God is Love. Without God there is all that there is without Love; hate, despair, fornication, greed etc.\n \n Evil is not an equally valid option - how could it be? How could despair be good of itself? Only hope - the over-coming of despair is good.",

God, being infinitely good, created everything for the benefit and happiness of man. \"Then God saw everything that He had made, and indeed it was very good\" we read at the end of the Biblical narrative regarding the creation of the world (Gen. 1:31). God created man, pure, good and provided him with high spiritual qualities, likening him with Himself. Man?s designation was to develop within himself good qualities, so that the more he attained closeness to God, the more he incorporated himself to the blissfulness of Divine life.\"\n http://www.fatheralexander.org/booklets/english/afflictions_in_our_lives.htm\n \n He revealed Himself to His creation; starting with Adam and said to Adam to do as he wished, except eat of one tree.\n \n In Orthodox teaching evil is real. So is Satan. There is a poor attempt at explaining the many shades of Christian views at http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/dvera/Muse/XianSatanEvil.html; written without reference to Orthodox views.\n \n However the Orthodox view is to me a wee bit enigmatic\n \"One may define evil as nothingness. Certainly evil never exits by itself but only inside of Goodness. Evil is a pure negation, a privation, a mutilation. But, though evil is a void of nothingness, it is a void which exists, which swallows and devours beings. It has no power to create, but its destructive power is enormous. Evil never ascends, it always descends. The very debasement of being that it produces is frightening. Evil is chaotic, it is a separation, a decomposition constantly in progress, a disorganization of the entire structure of being.\"\n http://www.fatheralexander.org/booklets/english/good_and_evil.htm\n \n That there is bad all around you - would you still have preferred non-existence - do you wish you'd never been born?\n \n Not at all, but I wonder how there can be anything besides God (good), and non-existence within this worldview you are speaking of.\n \n There is as far as I am aware a choice of being with God, or not.

Hell is, for us, a real place that will be eternal. You will, if you choose it, experience it forever.\n \n \n \n God is Love. Without God there is all that there is without Love; hate, despair, fornication, greed etc.\n\n \n \nWhere do hate, despair, fornication, greed, etc., come from? How can anything exist without God?\n\n \n God gave us a choice. When God created the choice, that did not mean that we had to make the wrong choice. The action of disobeying is us taking the wrong choice - as Adam did. Like, just because I bake a cake and put it on the window-ledge, doesn't imply that it must be stolen and eaten; though you could argue that I should have taken more care; as if I'm responsible for someone making the wrong choice.\n \n \nEvil is not an equally valid option - how could it be?\n\n \n \nI don't disagree, but if it isn't valid logic I'll need more than that to understand why.\n\n \n Because evil is 'evil'. It is wrong. It is wrong to be wanting to be wrong. That is its essence. Such as poison is in essence poisonous. It is of its essence harmful. Knowing this should be enough for someone to realise not to partake of it.\n \n God is goodness. \"If God does not send us something, or even takes it away, then it is for the best: He can best see what we need.\"\n http://www.fatheralexander.org/booklets/english/afflictions_in_our_lives.htm\n \n \n \"According to the Holy Scripture and the experiences of the Holy Fathers, the only true evil is the violation of moral norms. From this, other forms of evil take root. The moral evil originates inside a morally-lax being and if it is not voluntarily cut short by him, then it ripens more and becomes stronger in man, gradually merging with his will and manifesting itself to a greater degree in destructive and loathsome actions.\"\n http://www.fatheralexander.org/booklets/english/afflictions_in_our_lives.htm",

I think I've mentioned on a number of occasions that we Orthodox remain a Church of 'mystery' because in general it is not our way to delve into too fine a point. The problem is we use language which itself is limited, and can easily create paradoxes.\n \n I can make the statement (which I hold true) that \"God is the perfect being who is all-powerful who can do anything\"\n and you can say \"God can't do one thing, then!\"\n \"What's that?\"\n \"Make a mistake!\"\n \n That is a paradox. We accept God is all-powerful. We accept that God is good.\n \n Likewise we accept that evil does not come from good; it does seem illogical to think that it could, we think - why take this any further.\n \n I guess I am now moving into faith, more so than reason, and for the time being can do no better because of the limitations on my own cranial capability. I think a Catholic (being more legalistic) is the type of person to answer this kind of question. Alternatively, you can read http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm which deals with these same issues - but in great detail; the existence of a real hell, the eternity of hell's punishment etc.\n \n There is, and this may not be very satisfactory, a point to which this Orthodox believer will not go past. I guess we've reached it here for me in so far as rationalistic explanations of a paradox go. We go all 'eastern' here and say that there are simply things we will never know. (For instance; even when we return to God, in heaven, we will never know Him fully, simply because it is impossible to understand the 'all' when we are less than that).\n \n Maybe another Orthodox out there is prepared to go further. Actually I can't decide whether I'm unwilling/unable. I do know that there are no paradoxes for God, only for us.\n \n \n To not be with God will be to be in hell.\n\n \n \nI understand that. My question is, how can that be? How can there be anything without God? How can there be anything he didn't create?\n\n \n God by His own power will allow you to be separate from Him. He is so powerful that He can do this. He can over-come the paradoxical.\n \n \nGod gave us a choice.\n\n \n \nGot it. Him or not-him. The question I'm asking is, if he didn't create the not-him, who did? If he did create the not-him, then he created a something to exist in the absence of him: he created evil.\n\n \n I believe I answered\n a) I know, so far as Adam is concerned\n and\n b) I don't know as far as Satan is concerned.\n \n I think you'd be more interested in b)\n \n \n According to the Holy Scripture and the experiences of the Holy Fathers, the only true evil is the violation of moral norms.\n\n \n \nHow is that that you can say that God created the choice of whether to choose respect for or violation of \"moral norms\" without it being necessary thus that God created evil?\n\n \n As far as I'm aware, the analogy of the baked cake works.

I am responsible in so far as I have created the opportunity, but the decision is yours. The mere opportunity does not mean that you will necessarily take my car. You may decide not to.

Your questions have stirred my western-educated curiosity; despite my Orthodox faith. I have been reading about this subject all afternoon and into the early evening.\n \n I could tell you that Adam was tempted by the serpent - but you want to know where did the serpent's 'evilness' spring from.\n \n Satan was created with Free Will. Free Will is only a real gift if there is a choice; if there's no choice, one can not exercise the 'will' part. Also this is not a matter of compulsion, otherwise there's not 'free' part.\n \n \"It is impossible to explain the origin of sin, or to give a reason for its existence. It is an intruder, for whose existence no reason can be given. It is mysterious, unaccountable; to excuse it, is to defend it. Could it be excused, could a cause be shown for its existence, it would cease to be sin. Our only definition of sin is that given in the word of God: it is \"the transgression of the law.\"\"\n http://www.benabraham.com/html/24_-_origin_of_evil.html\n \n It some suggest sin; pride specifically grew slowly in Lucifer;\n \"Pride in his own glory nourished the desire for supremacy. The high honors conferred upon Lucifer were not appreciated as the gift of God, and called forth no gratitude to the Creator. He gloried in his brightness and exaltation, and aspired to be equal with God. He was beloved and reverenced by the heavenly host. Angels delighted to execute his commands, and he was clothed with wisdom and glory above them all. Yet the Son of God was the acknowledged sovereign of Heaven, one in power and authority with the Father. In all the counsels of God, Christ was a participant, while Lucifer was not permitted thus to enter into the divine purposes. ?Why,? questioned this mighty angel, ?should Christ have the supremacy? Why is he thus honored above Lucifer?\"\n http://www.pacinst.com/origin.htm\n \n My guess is that Lucifer, an imperfect being (there being only one; God) had already this ability within him; to sin because he was \n not perfect. He perhaps sought perfection through his own efforts. Jesus, who existed with God since the beginning is higher in praiseworthiness than Lucifer. Lucifer may have attempted to become more high.\n \n He began to believe that he could perhaps reach the equal of God through his own efforts - perhaps this came from a mistaken belief that doing so hew would become closer to God... to be more God-like (which is in fact the goal of Orthodox Christians - however we realise that we will never achieve this\n a) through our own efforts alone\n and\n b) ultimately, no matter how close to God we become, we will always be less than God.\n \n I think I've found something important; a key paragraph I found states... \"The heavenly councils admonished Lucifer to change his course. The Son of God warned and entreated him not to venture thus to dishonor his Maker, and bring ruin upon himself. But instead of yielding, Satan represented to those who loved him, that he had been wrongly judged, that his dignity was not respected, and that his liberty was to be abridged.\"\n http://www.benabraham.com/html/24_-_origin_of_evil.html\n \n Herein lies the origins - a choice. He was told not to continue with his efforts but he chose to disobey. When faced with a choice he was faced with the possibility of disobedience. He could have obeyed. He chose not to. That is the origin of evil. Satan continued to believe that he could through his own efforts become more like God - perhaps he thought to be Gods equal. He was told not to; and he directly challenged God... perhaps thinking that God was trying to stop him from achieving greatness.\n \n It continues...\n \" To the last, he refused to acknowledge his own course to be deserving of censure. When the consequence of his disaffection became apparent, and it was decreed that with all his sympathizers he must be forever banished from the abode of bliss, the arch-deceiver threw the blame wholly upon Christ. With one accord, Satan and his hosts declared that had they not been reproved, the rebellion would never have occurred, thus making Christ responsible for their course. Thus stubborn and defiant in their disloyalty, seeking vainly to overthrow the government of God, yet blasphemously claiming to be themselves the innocent victims of oppressive power, the arch rebel and all his sympathizers were at last banished from Heaven.\"\n Ibid.\n \n Thus God provided Satan with an opportunity to disobey or to obey.\n \n \n Also, an Asian answer might be found at http://www.theosophical.ca/OriginEvil.htm\n \n An unsatisfactory account is given at http://www.solbaram.org/articles/genevo.html which suggests that evil 'evolved', and uses nature as an example.",

I can more readily understand believing that Hell is experienced in our lifetimes when we are lost in self-destructive behaviour.\n\n \n My belief is that because the person in hell has chosen to be there...by saying \"I don't want to be with God\" - in words or actions (viz. sin)\n \n I did think about 'what if a person changes their mind?' Like, say I go to hell and go \"Oo, this isn't such a fantastic place after-all, maybe I better start loving God'\"\n \n But I think to get to hell you'd have to be pretty warped in the first place... and think that good is evil, bad is good etc.\n \n Someone like Adolf Hitler, I believe, is hellish. His life became one full of hate - at the end he hated - even his own people - for being weak and loosing the war to the 'untermenschen' (sub-humans; Russians).\n \n I'm not sure if Adolf Hitler felt 'karma' whilst here on earth.\n \n \nTo all Christians out there who don't believe in a hell - what happens to bad people?

You can believe that your Church makes it easier to be close to God, or brings you closer to him, without proselytising like a vacuum salesman.\n\n \n This is where we differ from other Christian churches. Many Protestants talk about salvation only coming to those who believe in Christ and being 'born-again' in Him.\n Catholics (I believe; and I hope I'm not misrepresenting them) say salvation comes through the instruments of their church.\n \n However, Orthodoxy does say that we're the best 'guide' for heaven.\n \n \nThus stubborn and defiant in their disloyalty, seeking vainly to overthrow the government of God, yet blasphemously claiming to be themselves the innocent victims of oppressive power, the arch rebel and all his sympathizers were at last banished from Heaven.\"\n Ibid.\n Thus God provided Satan with an opportunity to disobey or to obey.\n\n \n \nSo who created Hell, then, if Hell really exists and Satan has dominion over it?

It is the place to which he went after being expelled from heaven. It is a place which his own arrogance - his own hate of God separates him from God. A place where he wanted to be away from Love.\n \n Secondly, Satan didn't just stop obeying. Although I didn't quote it - it's from the same web-page - a suggestion that Satan actually began to spread lies to other Angels about God - claiming that if they joined with him, they could all be like God. He didn't stop at the foolish stage - he tapped into a whole new lot of experiences that grew from his own weakness in disobeying.\n \n \n \"It is impossible to explain the origin of sin, or to give a reason for its existence. It is an intruder, for whose existence no reason can be given.\"\n\n \n \nWell, this person you quoted seems the most honest about the inconsistency of it. If it is, in fact, a mystery beyond human comprehension, then it being illogical is irrelevant. I think it would be odd for a God to expect us to be able to avoid or fight something we can't possibly understand, though.\n\n \n We can't ever hope to FULLY understand God either. We can get a glimpse though. We do know that God is good and Satan is evil. That uncertainty in the middle though is liable to make for error... which is why we need a guide - to me this is the Orthodox Church.\n \n As I said, even when we are with God - in heaven - we will never fully know Him. Ultimately faith takes over - but it is reasoned faith. This is not an oxymoron. If you live with someone for some years, you get to know them. If they come home late from work - there may be a suspicion of an office 'fling' but you trust them - because you know them. This is faith because you don't know for sure, but it is reasoned faith, because you have a reason to trust.\n \n Likewise, by letting God's love into your life you come to know God (at least better). You develop trust. Although never fully understanding Him, you come to trust Him.\n \n We Orthodox aren't keen in endless definitions because this is what bogged the Jews down. For instance they were given 10 Commandments. One - thou shalt not kill. Obviously people would ask \"But what about 'self-defence' or 'what about in this situation' or 'in that situation' and so Exodus and the following books are full of laws that are expanded and expanded till the point where Jesus came along and they accused Him of breaking Sabbath laws and He said that they were there for man. You can get bogged down in logical paradoxes. This is, I believe, what's happened in Catholicism which is why they now believe in Mary as co-redemptress, and her Immaculate Conception - they got into puzzles of logic and have moved further and further away from the Truth.\n Sometimes one just has to have reasoned faith. That is why the Orthodox Church says of itself 'we remain a Church of Mystery'\n \n We believe that it's arrogant to assume we can ever know it all. However, we don't discard rational thought - we just have a different mix than most other Christian Churches - coming from, I guess, our Eastern background.",

   "HanK:\n \n I would like to hear your replies to my questions in post 221 and 223. However, I will not be around for the weekend. Go ahead and post and I will try to catch up on monday or tuesday.\n \n Thanks\n\n \n E-faith there is some background that is necessary for you to understand where I&#8217;m coming from. Montalban has asked me about my beliefs also. I think he is interested mainly because he wants to point out where I&#8217;m wrong but since both of you have asked and we are in the Religion forum I&#8217;ll just post it instead of sending you a PM. Besides it might make for some good discussions.\n \n My Mother left Dad and I when I was five and I was fortunate enough to have a Dad that didn&#8217;t leave. He was a very compassionate man but because he was abused as a child, he was a violent person. Again fortunately for me, he was able to control to a large extent that anger when dealing with me. Because of his lack of education, it was very difficult for him to support the two of us. I won&#8217;t go into details but he made large sacrifices to keep things going. As I got older, I realized what he had done and you cannot imagine the amount of love I have for that man. He is gone now but even after all this time it is difficult to write without totally falling apart. My beliefs and relationship with God are to a large extent based on my relationship with my Dad. I might add that I also became aware that although it wasn&#8217;t often, his sometimes harsh handling of me was the result of his childhood and I was able to avoid that with my children. So in two short generations, mainly because of my Dads strong personality in being able to overcome severe abuse, my family has gone from severe abuse to rational discipline without spankings. And the results are seen in my children&#8217;s strong but loving personalities.\n \n My dad was a dedicated Christian in the sense that he sincerely believed in God and the Bible. I was raised in the Baptist Church and was there whenever the doors were open. Our money was tithed before anything else was paid. So I was indoctrinated in religion and the Bible. By my late teens I was beginning to question my beliefs and the fear of going to hell because of that was on my mind a lot but I was afraid to verbalize anything. Throughout my twenties, I gradually begin to ask more and more questions and the fear of hell was a mental torture. I once talked to my pastor and he told me to stop questioning and just believe the &#8216;truth&#8217;. Maybe other people can do that but for me, things have to &#8216;add up&#8217;. I just can&#8217;t believe something that doesn&#8217;t seem to fit with reality. During my late twenties, I was desperate to get some kind of resolution about my beliefs. I was reading everything I could get my hands on about all different religions and was often terrified that I might die without belief. Loud startling noises would send waves of sickness through my stomach for fear that the Second Coming had started and I would be lost. Then I ran across a book called &#8216;The Peaceable Kingdom&#8217; which I didn&#8217;t put down till I had read it from cover to cover. It was a historical novel about the founder of the Quaker movement in England and their subsequent settlements in America. It talked about how the Holy Spirit could be used as a guide for spiritual interpretation and development. For the first time in years, I had hope that I might be able to resolve some issues. I began to pray and fast to try and gain some kind of peace. At the time, the most important part of the Bible for me became the words of Jesus in Luke 11:8-13\n \n And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent? Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?\n \n I took that as a promise that if I were earnest in my search, God would give me some kind of answer. After about six months, I took a week of vacation and vowed to fast and pray the whole week. The longest I had fasted up to that point was two days and it had been difficult to say the least. Interestingly though I never even got hungry during the entire seven days. So it wasn&#8217;t even a sacrifice. After that point, God fulfilled his promise and I believe it was because I took the words of Jesus to be true.\n \n Now after that background I will tell you what I came to believe. If I do not put &#8216;I believe&#8217; before every sentence, it is because I am trying to shorten the sentence, not because I am making a statement that it is the truth that everyone should believe. These are my beliefs only.\n \n I began to think of God in the same way I thought of my Father. As a loving and caring spirit that only had my best interest at heart. Except that God did not have the faults my Father had. He was perfect and had perfect love. It was an immense relief to realize that I was not going to hell because there was no hell. This is why you saw me post the question &#8216;If you are a parent, would you create a place of eternal torture for your children.&#8217; And all the reading I had done about different people in the Bible and different religions began to start making sense. They were all different, but they all had a central theme. God loves us and he wants us to treat others the same as he treats us. It wasn&#8217;t complicated at all, in fact it was so simple it was hard to see.\n \n I was working in a field that required cold rational logic for everything I did. All the struggling I did with things not adding up like the virgin birth, or the killings in the OT, or the creation model of the earth were not necessary. They were of minor importance to what I needed to know. And even those began to take on new and awesome meanings compared to what I had been taught and I began to see everything in a totally different light. I was freed from the idea that not believing in a literal Bible was going to end in my eternal torture. For instance I could now freely believe that God had created us over a very long period of time and that just showed how much he loved us. Like a human that cares immensely more for a child that he/she has raised from birth instead of adopted at the age of 18. The sleepless night worrying about a fever, or the time spent going to unimportant plays or athletic events that are only interesting to parents because they see their child developing into health adults, or like my Father that sacrificed so much to keep me. Or not understanding how God could have commanded those people to commit genocide. Now I was free to understand that it was not God who commanded them, it was people that were struggling to develop a relationship with God. And that message was put down in writing so we could see how far we&#8217;ve come in our relationship with God. But most of all, and what you will probably call the most blasphemous of all, the understanding that Jesus was not God but a man. But for my understanding it made Jesus even more powerful for me. I had often struggled with how Jesus could be half God and half man. But there was also the other side that of me that thought how could it have been a sacrifice to die on the cross if he was God? That meant he would have know about the vastness of the universe and that the earth was just a small part of creation. So a few years here on earth out of eternity even if it included a few hours of torture would have been a cake walk for a god. I don&#8217;t mean to minimize the agony of the cross, just trying to express how my mind viewed the cross relative to God and eternity. On the other hand, suppose Jesus was just a man, albeit a very special man that was totally dedicated to God and had immense faith that God had a mission for him. He would have at times had doubts about that mission but in the end, prevailed over all those doubts. How strong a faith did it take to push the Romans into subjecting him to one of the most painful deaths of all time? And if you read the gospels you can see that he did push them into doing exactly that. Then no wonder he sweat blood in the garden before his death. How he must have struggled those last few days, am I really doing what God wants me to do or am I on a fools errand and all of this is just a delusion I have become convinced of? But in the end, he prevailed and changed the world. And his message became the hope of billions of people throughout the world. I get chill bumps just trying to wrap my mind around the concept.\n \n I believe that mankind is getting closer and closer to God as time goes on. That we are capable of developing &#8216;physical&#8217; type relations through God for those that are completely dedicated in the sense of miracles, as I believe Jesus did. However I don&#8217;t believe that to be super-natural, so they are miracles only in the sense that we are just now beginning the process and it looks super-natural to us, but actually they are just another step in the evolutionary process of becoming a more spiritual being. I am extremely optimistic about the future of mankind and his relationship with God, but also believe we can mess it up by not being willing to advance in our relationship with him. I do not believe every word in the Bible is the literal word of God but there are inspired parts, especially the teachings of Jesus, which can be determined by the help of the Holy Spirit.\n \n As a side note I believe that the Christian religion has done a disservice to mankind in one area, which is the area of sex. I believe the Christian religion has placed such a shroud of shame on sex that it has become a struggle for individuals to view it as a natural and important part of humanity.\n \n I could go on with more details, but I think you can see pretty much what I believe and why from what I have already stated. As I said, I&#8217;m not trying to convince you of anything, just sharing my beliefs as you asked. And as you can see, I will have no problem with anyone else&#8217;s beliefs as long as they don&#8217;t involve hurting others, but I believe the best path is the positive route of actively helping, caring and loving others. But since I have come to believe from your post that you are that kind of person, I respect your beliefs. How you get to that belief is immaterial to me.",

I believe the Christian religion has placed such a shroud of shame on sex that it has become a struggle for individuals to view it as a natural and important part of humanity.\n\n \n Hank, it is interesting that you raise the sex question.\n \n Orthodox do believe in male-female relationships...\n \n \"The Orthodox view of marriage is so taken-for-granted that only one Orthodox church has found it necessary to pronounce on the question of marriage and its relation to homosexuality. \"God wills that men and women marry, becoming husbands and wives.\" \"Homosexuality is to be approached as the result of humanity?s rebellion against God, and so against its own nature and well-being. It is not to be taken as a way of living and acting for men and women made in God?s image and likeness.\" \"Synodal Affirmations on Marriage, Family, Sexuality, and the Sanctity of Life,\" Orthodox Church in America: Tenth All-American Council, July 1992.\n quoted at http://marriagelaw.cua.edu/major_world_religions_on_the_que.htm\n \n However...\n \"It is probably getting clear to you where this is going. If you are thinking this means one partner in a totally committed relationship for life, you are absolutely right. That in fact *is* the ideal. That is the way it should be. It is often not the case. People die and people get divorced. Marriage is one of the Holy Sacraments or (preferred term) Mysteries. Out of compassion for humans and in order for them to keep on fulfilling their destiny of growth in union, re-marriages are permitted as a concession and are still Holy Mysteries. (There is also the way of monasticism where people fulfil their vocation by being dedicated to God directly instead of through/with a partner as in marriage). \n \n People also have sex before marriage and outside of marriage. From the above you will have noted that, since this is *not* the perfect/proper condition for the sexual act - such actions are sin. Sin can be repented of and we can learn from our falls. \n  But it is important that we view sin as sin - you can not repent of that which you do not consider to be sinful \n (although in the Orthodox Church we *do* ask for forgiveness of sins we have committed \"knowingly and unknowingly\"). And it is a mistake to do something wrong just because we know we can repent of it and learn from the sin. We should not take God and His forgiveness for granted, just as we should not take our friends and family for granted and be uncaring towards them just because we know they will forgive us. We should always try to be, to do our very best\n http://www.unicorne.org/orthodoxy/articles/answers/premarital.htm\n \n Thus Orthodoxy holds itself up as the ideal way of life - the ultimate guide. It says that ideally a sexual union concerns one man to one woman - in marriage (preferably their first one).\n \n The sentiment above is expanded at http://www.orthodoxresearchinstitute.org/articles/ethics/morelli_sex_natural_law.htm which states that we, unlike Catholics, don't base taboos on sex based on 'natural law'. You might like this article, Hank, as it mentions Gallileo and the Catholic Church (again!)\n \n We have a married clergy.",

   "Hank, it is interesting that you raise the sex question.\n \n Orthodox do believe in male-female relationships...\n\n \n I was not referring to the tradition of Catholic clergy not marrying. I was referring to the Christian religion in general. Just for instance, on the thread you pointed me to concerning the virgin birth, there was a lot of debate about whether Mary remained a virgin all her life. The debate centered on whether Mary &#8216;remained pure&#8217;. Forgetting the belief that Mary was a virgin when Jesus was born, the clear implication is that if Mary had of ever had sex, she would have somehow been defiled. To me, that is an insult to every married couple in the world. And I have heard many express similar views.\n \n For someone that is knowledgeable about Catholic tradition, I have heard that Catholics teach, or used to teach, that sex was the original sin. Is that true?",

I learned to be self protective early on and this still infuses into my marriage. I found Jesus at 27. I am slowly changing generational patterns in my life. I too could not accept the God that hated (also went to a baptist church as a child with my older sister. My parents were non-religious). I continue to search for who God is in my life and more, who I really am. I believe it can be known and that I will find it. \"Seek and ye shall find.\"\n \n I see Jesus very differently. To me, He is the Son of God. Both Fully God AND Fully man. (not half). I cannot see Him as just a good man. He claimed to be God. If He was just a man then he was nuts. I also see Him (at times) as the best friend I have ever had. He has helped me learn who I am. I do not deal well with it always but I know that I am forgiven. I do believe in Hell. I do not believe that God sends people there. I believe that choose to go there. I also believe in an Evil one named Satan or Lucifer or The Adversary. I believe he spends his time decieving those who don't know Jesus so that they will never know him and those that do know Jesus so that their lives will never make a difference in the world.\n \n I believe God would not want anyone to go to hell, but He took a chance when He made man with free will. He took an even bigger chance in announcing forgiveness before hand. That to me is the grace of God. I have been given more than I could ever imagine. Does it affect my life, not always. I hurt those I love entirely too often. But, there is that forgiveness thing again.\n \n Anyway, the discussion off these posts should be interesting.",

Expand or correct as needed.\n\n \n Yes but you are too charitable. :) I work at being kind and often don&#8217;t do a very good job of it. I was raised an only child and my experience is that often produces a selfish person. At least it did in my case as I struggle with the problem.\n \n \nPersonally, I am the son of an alcoholic father. My father shaped much of what I believe and the way I act. I learned to be self protective early on and this still infuses into my marriage. I found Jesus at 27. I am slowly changing generational patterns in my life. I too could not accept the God that hated (also went to a baptist church as a child with my older sister. My parents were non-religious). I continue to search for who God is in my life and more, who I really am. I believe it can be known and that I will find it. \"Seek and ye shall find.\"\n\n \n My best friend&#8217;s family also were non-religious and he became a Christian. Although we have discussions concerning theology, I think Christianity has been an asset to him as he is one of the most decent people I know. However from what he tells me about his parents, they were also very decent.\n \n I also continue to search. But my basic beliefs are fairly set.\n \n \nI see Jesus very differently. To me, He is the Son of God. Both Fully God AND Fully man. (not half). I cannot see Him as just a good man. He claimed to be God. If He was just a man then he was nuts. I also see Him (at times) as the best friend I have ever had. He has helped me learn who I am. I do not deal well with it always but I know that I am forgiven. I do believe in Hell. I do not believe that God sends people there. I believe that choose to go there. I also believe in an Evil one named Satan or Lucifer or The Adversary. I believe he spends his time decieving those who don't know Jesus so that they will never know him and those that do know Jesus so that their lives will never make a difference in the world.\n\n \n I used half God as a way of conversing. I know the theology of fully God and fully man, although it never made sense to me.\n \n People like me think the supernatural parts of his teachings, along with other areas of the Bible were added in order to give credence to the superiority of the Christian religion.\n \n \nI believe God would not want anyone to go to hell, but He took a chance when He made man with free will. He took an even bigger chance in announcing forgiveness before hand. That to me is the grace of God. I have been given more than I could ever imagine. Does it affect my life, not always. I hurt those I love entirely too often. But, there is that forgiveness thing again.\n\n \n To me this relates back to my relationship with my children. They couldn&#8217;t do anything bad enough for me to create a hell for them. So what did mankind do that was bad enough to spend an eternity in torture? Well it seems he disobeyed God if you are referring to the Jewish tradition. Or maybe rejected God in the extreme. But holy cow we are talking about a Supreme Being that created the universe. Does someone that created the universe have an ego so weak that a creation of his rejecting him would cause such diabolical revenge? Even mankind doesn&#8217;t call that justice as evidenced by man-made laws that restrict torture. My Mother rejected me and I wouldn&#8217;t create an eternal torture for her even if I had the power. In fact I have forgiven her for that. I&#8217;m sure this sounds harsh and I&#8217;m reluctant to criticize someone&#8217;s beliefs but we are hopefully talking honestly here. If it offends you then I&#8217;ll drop it.\n \n \nAnyway, the discussion off these posts should be interesting.\n\n \n I think you&#8217;re right. :)",

However, God is also righteous and Holy. Sin is an issue. He cannot simply wink at it. He must deal with it. He did this in Jesus.\n \n Second, What about the idea that if Jesus was just a man then he was crazy. He claimed to be God after all.\n \n The idea of Jesus being fully God and fully man is a difficult one. So is the idea of God who loves and the same God that is Holy and Righteous.\n \n However, let us look at your kids. I don't know how old they are, but at some point you watch your children make poor choices. And you let them do it. At some age, children are no longer controlled by their parents, but rather are influenced. You hope for good choices, but they are allowed to make their own choices. It is part of growing up. \n \n As I said earlier, I don't think God created hell, just the possibility of it. God did not create sin, just the possibility of it. God desires above all for you and I to love him. If it is under threat of hell, that is not love (in my opinion). Too many christians spend too much time telling people that if they don't believe in God then they are going to hell. Jesus never did that. Instead, He showed them a God that loves, that is righteous, that is Holy, that is beautiful. \n \n He said, \"by this all men shall know that you are my disciples, that you have love, one for another.\" Much of \"christendom\" has focused on the hellfire and brimstone message and forgotten this sentence.

   "Lemme get this straight....\n \n Since god created man and choice.... when man chooses to reject god (\"close his eyes\", if you will), man creates his own hell, thereby attributing god with an assist (to use a basketball analogy) in hell's creation?\n \n So really, you're saying that god didn't create hell, he just made the framework for hell to exist. Yet, there are only two options of choice: opening your eyes (heaven) or closing your eyes (hell), by your own admission. Therefore, god, in a somewhat sadistic mindset, gave man the choice that many parents give childen: \"My way, or the highway,\" except that this god and \"parent\" knew full well that the \"highway\" was in fact a very hot and fiery place.\n \n This is the real question....\n \n Since I truthfully create my own hell by rejecting god, could I not make my hell a quite happy and joyous place? If it's freewill, there's no law by god that says hell has to be bad. If there is such a law, that means I don't create my own hell. I mean, is closing your eyes always a bad thing?\n \n Nope. :)\n\n \n \n I think you may have an incorrect view of hell. Yes God created it. Hell is the place where God is not. If god is Love, good, and just. Then every place he touches is equally loving, good, and filled with justice. The places without God are dark, hateful, and corrupt places. Hell id defined in these trems. Also bears mentioning that these are the charcacteristics desired by its inhabitants. Don't get me wrong they won't like it but they hate God even more because of it. To a man who spent his life spiting in the face of God, a eterinty of His worship would not be a blessing. The unsaved person doesn't full understand the love which God bestows on His children. Therefore they can'y fully understand the lonliness, and despair of life without him.",

If the reverse were true there would be no unhappy christians.\n \n 2nd, There is a lake of fire, which will see the evil souls and the evil angels and their torment will go on.

   "I was not referring to the tradition of Catholic clergy not marrying. I was referring to the Christian religion in general. Just for instance, on the thread you pointed me to concerning the virgin birth, there was a lot of debate about whether Mary remained a virgin all her life. The debate centered on whether Mary 'remained pure'. Forgetting the belief that Mary was a virgin when Jesus was born, the clear implication is that if Mary had of ever had sex, she would have somehow been defiled. To me, that is an insult to every married couple in the world. And I have heard many express similar views.\n\n \n The reason we believe that Mary is ever-virgin is because she is set aside from the mundane. She lived an exceptional life - unlike any other woman, and I guess, if I want to border on blasphemous, having been with God no man could compare.\n \n \nFor someone that is knowledgeable about Catholic tradition, I have heard that Catholics teach, or used to teach, that sex was the original sin. Is that true?\n\n \n I think Maximus better answer that one.",

After all I believe I have a strong personal relationship with God even though I have never met him face to face. So as a friend, I wish you an especially merry Christmas.\n \n I have a story I want to share with you because it has made this Christmas one of the best I have ever had. And I only have good memories of Christmas so it&#8217;s saying a lot. I&#8217;m telling you because I feel sure you will value the story and will understand why I want to share it with you.\n \n Coaching my children&#8217;s sports teams has given me a lot of pleasure, but also presented me with several opportunities to I think make meaning contributions to young peoples lives. But this is about a parent. About a year ago I had a little girl on my daughter&#8217;s soccer team who&#8217;s mother had what I thought was Parkinson&#8217;s disease. She shook badly all the time and had a difficult time walking, sleeping and in general just functioning. We became friends after a few months she talked to me freely about her problem. She was in her mid-thirties and I was amazed to discover that although her shaking had started in her early twenties, she had never seen a doctor because she was afraid of what she would find out. I encouraged her to see a doctor and started calling and emailing her at least twice a week in addition to the times when I saw her at the games and practice. We became good friends and she finally agreed to see someone, as she said, just to get me off her back. She missed her first appointment because she chickened out at the last minute. But after more harassment she finally went. It turns out she had a genetic defect, not Parkinson and as luck or fate or whatever it&#8217;s called would have it, the doctor she saw knew of a doctor that specialized in her problem. And it was in the same town we lived in of all things. It also turns out that there was a good chance that it was treatable with medication. My daughter had moved to a different league and I did not see her the whole time she was on the medication but we kept in close contact and I knew the medicine was working. A few weeks ago there was a soccer tournament where the teams were playing each other so I was looking for her. As I saw her walking across the field towards me, there was no trembling at all. The only evidence of anything was a very slight limp caused by years of not using her leg muscle correctly. As we embraced and I held her for a few seconds, it took every ounce of will power I had to keep from breaking down. I would have swapped every Christmas present I had ever had to see her as I saw her that second. I couldn&#8217;t imagine a better Christmas present and I thank God that she entered my life. My Christmas has already been a merry Christmas.",

   "Once again, Mizmaxx, you've forced my hand - I had to research slavery. (at first I relied on \"Christianity on Trial\" by Carroll, V, & Shiflett, D) but then looked further afar.\n \n I did a search under \"Orthodox\" and \"Slavery\" together, and hoped to present a mainly pro-Orthodox view, with a few anti-Orthodox points for balance. :)\n \n However, the anti-side came up with\n \"Orthodox Christianity also supported the practice of slavery in North America. The eighteenth century Anglican Church made it clear that Christianity freed people from eternal damnation, not from the bonds of slavery.\"\n http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/ellerbe0.htm\n \n The Anglican Church is not 'Orthodox'! It might be 'orthodox' with a small 'o', but this site seems to mix up the two.\n \n \n However, to my main point...\n Pagans Plato and Aristotle supported slavery. Aristotle said \"From the hour of their birth some are marked out for subjection, others for rule\" (From \"Politics\" quoted in \"Christianity on Trial\" p27) (see http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/greek-slaves.html#Aristotle for the context.*\n \n Slavery was already an institution when Christianity came into being. St Paul says \"Slaves obey your masters\", but then also urges masters to treat their slaves well, because ultimately, we all have one master. (Ephesians 6:5ff), because in heaven \"There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus\" (1 Corinthians 12:13).**\n \n The main difference I can see with regard to slavery between Islamic and Christian view-points is that Islam has issues with slaves, only when the slaves are converted to Islam. Christians believe that all men are created in the image of God, and therefore, regardless of one's religion, the central struggle for Christians was how to tackle the issue of owning people who are in essence the same as yourself. This struggle resulted in Christians realising that slavery was abhorrent. For Islam, it still is accepted and acceptable an institution.\n Islam has always been about treating differently those who are co-religionists, and those who are not.\n \n There have been Christians struggling against slavery throughout the history of Christianity. Some of the early popes supported it...\n \n Pope Gregory I forbade slaves from marrying free Christians. Pope Gregory XI would sometimes enslave people who were excommunicated.\n \n Pope Nicholas V was in favour of slavery.\n \n HOWEVER in 1537 Pope Paul III said that no American Indian should be enslaved. Pope Innocent XI ruled that it was not permitted to buy or sell Africans who had been sized against their will. The Papacy condemned slavery or the slave trade in 1462, 1741, 1815 and 1839.\n \n This might seem a chequered history. However compared to Islam, which still supports slavery it is by far a better record.*** For Christians can look beyond the laws and morals that are affected by trends.\n \n Christians have, through Christianity itself, come to realise that slavery is wrong. Islam can't because of the nature of Islam. Muhammed is put forward as the 'ideal' man. He owned slaves. If Allah had wanted to end slavery - he'd have ordered his prophet to ban them.\n \n \" The grand plea is, \"They are authorized by law.\" But can law, human law, change the nature of things? Can it turn darkness into light, or evil into good? By no means. Notwithstanding ten thousand laws, right is right, and wrong is wrong still. There must still remain an essential difference between justice and injustice, cruelty and mercy. So that I still ask, Who can reconcile this treatment of the Negroes, first and last, with either mercy or justice?\"\n So argued the Christian, John Wesley in his \"Thoughts Upon Slavery\".\n http://gbgm-umc.org/umw/wesley/thoughtsuponslavery.stm\n \n Under Islam, everyone must learn Arabic. That is cultural imperialism.**** Orthodox have always taught the Bible in the language of the respective peoples.\n \n Further, Islam taught that black people were less than the others...\n \"Abu Darda reported that the Holy Prophet said: Allah created Adam when he created him (sic). Then He stroke (sic) his right shoulder and took out a white race as if they were seeds, and He stroke (sic) his left shoulder and took out a black race as if they were coals. Then He said to those who were in his right side: Towards paradise and I don't care. He said to those who were on his left shoulder: Towards Hell and I don't care. - Ahmad\" (Mishkat ul-Masabih, translated by Karim, v. iii, p. 117)\n quoted at http://answering-islam.org.uk/Index/B/blackskin.html. Muhammad himself, owned slaves http://answering-islam.org.uk/Index/S/slaves.html\n \n As for Christianity being \"the white man's religion,\" it was born in Asia and spread to Africa before it spread to Europe. Although it grew faster in Europe for many centuries, it is now growing much faster outside of Europe. African, Asian and Latino Christians have doubled in the past 25 years and now number 980 million. This compared to only 730 million \"white\" (European & American) Christians! Numerically at least, Christianity is no longer just the white man?s religion.\n http://answering-islam.org/Bailey/which_roots.html\n \n *Note that all great civilizations have had slavery\n Romans,\n Indus Valley\n China\n Egypt\n A look at slavery under Roman Pagans can be found at http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/slavery-romrep1.html\n \n \n ** St. John Chrysostom's homily on this passage suggests that it means that it matters not what we are in this life, slave or free, Greek or Jew, because in the end we are all equally called to God - so it is not a support of slavery, any more than it is suggesting people should be Greek.\n \n ***Mauritania still has slavery\n http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/ENGAFR380052002\n In Sudan, the Muslim-Arabs continually attack the Black-African south, and cart away Christians and animists into slavery.\n \"Yet another refugee in Birak from Jafal said that the Janjawid told them: \"You are opponents to the government, we must crush you. As you are black, you are slaves.\" The government is on our side. The government plane is on our side.\" \"\n http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engafr541012003\n \"Despite its being illegal in the UAE to employ a child under 15 and to expose a child to dangerous work, using children as camel jockeys continues despite years of pressure for it to stop.\"\n http://www.antislavery.org/homepage/news/childslavery120602.htm\n \n \n However, if you want the Islamic 'revised' form of history of slavery; visit http://al-islam.org/slavery/index.htm\n \n \n ****Islam: As well as cultural imperialism (non-Muslims had to pay special taxes, and wear special clothing identifying them as second-class people), slavery, misogyny and racism, there is the stifling of 'free thought' where it is still against the law under Islam to convert from Islam\n http://answering-islam.org/Hahn/Mawdudi/index.htm\n \n \n \n \n JakeCJB, I believe you are suggesting that Quakers arne't by nature 'liberal' then you're ill-informed. In Voltaire's \"Letters on England\" he comments that the Quakers treated well with the American Indians - being both the only settlers never to have a written treaty (only having informal treaties), and also the only group not to break their treaties.\n \n Quakers believed in equality of the sexes from the word 'go'.",

That is judgement and is reserved for God, no one else shoud declare such a thing. \n \n IC: you do not know whether or not God will choose to have mercy on any person. You are not God. You do not know the minds of all men. Your answer to letgo is to an older post and the discussion has moved way beyond it.\n \n It is much more important to speak of Jesus and who HE is. He will judge, absolutely, yet the judge is a loving man who chose to die for me. (And you and letgo.)",
