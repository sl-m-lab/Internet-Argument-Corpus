   "Just read through these descriptions of how abortions are done and maybe you'll think differently about your view if you support it..\n \n Descriptions of abortion methods\n \n Suction curretage\n The abortion dilates the woman's cervix and inserts a tube with a sharp edge on the tip. The other end of the tube is connected to a suction device, similar to a home vacuum cleaner but much more powerful. Between the sharp edge and the force of the suction, the developing baby is torn apart and the pieces sucked out through the tube.\n \n This method is usually used for first-trimester abortions.\n \n Dilation and Extraction (D&X)\n The unborn baby is partially delivered feet first, until just the head remains inside the uterus. Then a hole is punched in the back of the skull with a sharp object and the brains are suctioned out. Once the baby is dead, the head is also pulled out of the uterus.\n \n This method is usually used for late second-trimester and third-trimester abortions.\n \n Dilation and Evacuation (D&E)\n A seaweed-based substance called \"laminaria\" is inserted into the cervix to dilate it, usually overnight. The next day forceps with sharp metal teeth are inserted and used to twist and tear off the unborn baby's limbs and remove them piece by piece. The head is usually too large to be removed whole and must be crushed.\n \n This method is usually used for second-trimester abortions.\n \n Saline Instillation (Salt Poisoning)\n Salt water is injected into the womb through the mother's abdomen. The unborn baby swallows this fluid and is poisoned by it. Within 24 hours the mother goes into labor and delivers a dead baby.\n \n This method is usually used for second- and third- rimester abortions. It is disliked because it is unreliable, and the baby would often be delivered premature but alive and seriously injured and then set on a table to die.\n \n Prostaglandin Instillation\n A chemical of a class known as \"prostaglandins\" is injected into the womb. It causes the mother to go into early labor with very strong contractions. These contractions crush the baby, which combined with the premature delivery is usually fatal.\n \n Non-surgical\n This is a general term that primarily includes abortions induced by drugs, such as Methotrexate or RU-486. Some of these directly poison the developing baby; others interfere with or cut off the supply of nutrients.\n \n \n now after reading this, im torn to pieces that we allow this to go on in our nation. We seriously need to re-examine our hearts and see whats wrong with us if we support the tearing apart of our own children.",

Some of these directly poison the developing baby; others interfere with or cut off the supply of nutrients.\n\n \n No, they induce shedding of the uterine wall, much like a period, and must be used within about 50 days of the last menstrual period.

Can it be used against my will? Even used against me in apparent violation of other 'rights'?\n It is my body and I should have 100% say over it's use...\n \n What about forced medication? Should the state be allowed to force me to take what ever strange concoctions because they think it'll make me normal? What if they deem my own desires to not take such medications as an abberation caused by mental disability that the medications should correct?\n I'm sure many would say that a medical doctor declaring me mentally incompetant to make descisions on my own justifies another, like a judge, to make them for me.

   "Hunter - no, but it might help you guys in the pro-paternalism camp to understand what it means to be pro-choice.\n \n Yes, I said pro-choice. Being pro-choice means that you uphold a woman's right to decide what is done with her body (including the killing of any unwelcome residents), and prefer that right to any rights a fetus might have to being carried to term. \n \n Pro-choice means supporting a woman's decision in the matter, whether it is a good choice or a bad choice. \n \n It's a question of value. You guys hold the right of the fetus to be carried to term as paramount and appear to be willing to violate a woman's right to choose. We hold the woman's right to choose to be paramount.\n \n It's not the case that we don't feel compassion, and indeed you slander us with that accusation. I repeat that the pro-choice position is not a case of compassion for the fetus or lack thereof. \n \n We feel compassion for any mother brought to such a decision and for the child that may be lost to us. However, we also feel compassion for the unwilling mother, and the unwanted child. \n \n Ideally women should be willing to bring unwanted children to term so that others may raise them. \n \n But when they aren't, we respect that autonomy and try to give them access to the safest abortion procedures possible in order to minimize the potential harm. \n \n Compassion, the ethic of care, requires that we respect the choice of the mother in this matter over the life of the fetus.\n\n \n Compassion my :xcensored .

   "Little Jimmy was out playing with his friends on his bike. Unbeknownst to little Jimmy, he was heading for a huge bump in the road. Zooming over the bump, little Jimmy wrecked right into a tree. His friends quickly gathered around him and noticed he was unconscious.\n\n \n ...and his friends run off. \n \n \n\n Moments later, an ugly, ugly man approached little Jimmy. He too noticing that little Jimmy was unconscious breathed a sigh of relief. Because little Jimmy could feel no pain, the ugly, ugly man carefully removed all of Jimmy's limbs with his swiss army knife. The ugly, ugly man then just walked away.\n\n \n Moments later, Sigma and Cone approached, arguing. They both saw the boy and Sigma exclaimed, \"We must get him to the hospital so he does not bleed to death!\"\n \n Cone, on the other hand, wiped the tears from Cone's eyes and said, \"We must give him something for the pain and make him more comfortable!\"\n \n Sigma looked at Cone like Cone was crazy. Little Jimmy was unconsious, it was pointless to worry about whether he currently was in pain because little Jimmy could not feel pain. It would be equally pointless to worry about little Jimmy's comfort, because little Jimmy could not feel comfort or discomfort at the moment. Disregarding Cone's idiotic comment, Sigma spotted Cone's car and said, \"Lets get him to the hospital in your car\" and ran to open the door as Cone gingerly picked up little Jimmy and slowly walked to the car, apparently not wanting to cause the unconscious boy any pain. \n \n Cone tried to carfully put Jimmy in the seat sitting up, because that would be most comfortable, but Jimmy would not stay that way, being unconcious. Sigma pushed Cone aside and, always mindful that Jimmy would not sustain more physical injury and his current wounds wouldn't be worsened, put him in the car in a position that would be extremely uncomfortable for him had he been conscious but allowed him to stay in the car and he would not move as the two drove. Cone gasped, \"Have you no compassion! He must be in pain in that position!\" Again ignoring Cone, Sigma got in the car with Cone and drove to the hospital.\n \n At the hospital, the staff was able to regrow little Jimmy's limbs using new technology. The process was very itchy and very painful, and Cone whimpered at Sigma's side. \"Poor poor Jimmy\", sobbed Cone, \"the pain must be driving him mad!\". Sigma could not take any more and pummeled Cone for the idiocy Cone just spouted.\n \n The next morning Jimmy was awake. Sigma was at his side and told him, \"We will find the man who did this to you and make sure he is punished!\".\n \n Cone sat on Jimmy's other side. \"I'm so sorry you were in such pain! Sigma here has no compassion for all the pain and torment you went through.\"\n \n Jimmy looked at Cone, confused. \"I... didn't feel any pain. I was unconscious.\"\n \n Cone's face turned hard. \"That's just leftist propaganda. Of course you were in pain. Horrible pain.\" Sigma just shook Sigma's head in disbelief.\n \n \"Anyway\", Sigma continued, \"we will make sure the horrible man who did this is punished. Your rights were violated when he took parts of your body away. No one can do that to you against your will and--\"\n \n \"Actually\", Cone interrupted, \"I've heard about men like that. They harvest body parts to save other's lives, and of course life, no matter whos, is always more important than other's rights to their body. Sorry Jimmy. If you had died then I would say we should punish him but since you are fine now it's no big deal.\"\n \n \"What!\" sputtered Sigma. \"Even if that man was saving a life, little Jimmy's body is not fair game! He didn't give his permission for his body to be used in that way, and even if he would be fine afterwards it is not 'ok' to use his body like that!\"\n \n \"Hey, we all know these men are out there and do this to unconsious people\", said Cone in a righteous voice. \"Jimmy knew that a possible consequence to riding his bike was to have an accident and fall unconscious and he has to 'deal with' the consequences of his actions. He practically invited someone to harvest his body parts when he rode his bike!\"\n \n ...\n \n Jimmy wakes up in horror, and gradually calms as he realizes he does not live in Cone's world, but in a world that is a bit more compassionate.\n \n \n Disclaimer: The views expressed within do not necessarily represent the views of those depicted.\n \n What do you guys think?

I know and love many men.\n \n \n \n Oh really? Like all the Christian men I appealed to in my congregation all those years ago when my son needed a mentor? All the ones who could have cared less and weren't interested at all - until after three years of waiting on a list for a mentor,we actually got one. And even then they weren't interested in spending time with my son - only in trying to ensure he spent no time with a gay man. You mean those Christian men? \n \n Or how about certain un-named Catholics on this board who are oh so polite - but have made it so eveidently clear that my less than Leave It to Beaver  family is not as good as his? Christians like that?\n \n Or how about those on this board who feel women are little more than property and have stated as such?\n \n You know - any man wearing his Christianity as a badge of rights over me is going to get walked away from right quick.

I, too, feel compassion that the fetus lost it's life, but it is an abstract because there's nothing to empathize with.\n \n Take Samantha Runion (sp?) who was raped and killed by this Avila character. When her mother spoke about how Samantha believed in heroes and how she probably died thinking she would be rescued, I got misty eyed and felt a great deal of compassion for Samantha (her mother as well). I didn't feel compassion for Samantha as she was, because she's dead and it's pointless to feel compassion for someone who is dead. I empathized with and felt compassion for the image I had in my head of this little girl and how horrible it was that she had felt this way. \n \n You, on the other hand, are empahizing with something in your head that has no connection with reality. The fetus was never conscious, never had feelings and never felt pain or suffering or anything else for that matter. Empathy is impossible, because there's nothing there to empathize with.\n \n I can, however, empathize with and feel compassion for the woman (and I do). I can imagine a woman who just found out she is pregnant and is scared to death because her last 2 pregnancies were horribly painful and she desperately does not want to face that again. I can imagine a single woman who barely supports herself knowing she won't be able to work for half of the pregnancy. I can imagine so many situations, when the fetus is kicking the ribs of a woman and she is in pain, when a woman's back is permanetly damaged because of the pregnancy, when a woman's bladder is permanetly damaged, every situation that a woman suffers for the pregnancy... and knowing that it is not by choice. She did not choose to be pregnant. That, to me, is such a horrible state that society could get to. I can and do have a great deal of compassion for these situations and I know that situations like these and others far worse occur every day for thousands of women.\n \n In short, you empathize with and feel compassion for something that cannot feel or think or even has a brain. I empathize with and feel compassion for someone who can feel pain and can feel the indignity of knowing her rights are sacrificed because the gov't wants the fetus to live.",

I'm from Canada and our abortion rate is somewhat different from yours. \n \n According to your government, specifically their CDC agency, the rate of abortions is dropping. \n \n http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5404a6.htm\n \n http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5309a1.htm\n \n Given the size of your country and your rates of abortion, despite the recent decline, 40,000,000 strikes me as a low number \n \n \nOh and I am not going to say again what the frivelous reasons a lot of women have abortions here in the U.S. Instead of just attacking me take the time to go back and read the thread. You might lear something. Probably not though.\n I'm not trying to attack you. I did take the time to go through the thread. Unfortunately I can't find the reasons that you cite, which is why I asked you to repost them so we could discuss them. \n \n Again, could you please repost the list of reasons that you claim are frivolous or direct me to the posts in which you posted those reasons?",

I still had to support myself - which was fine until I had a bleeding episode in the 2nd trimester and had to quit my job. I still didn't get money. I was able to find a part time deal where I got to sit (rare in a place where nearly all the jobs are service industry).

For a accounting, your math is pretty bad. \n \n \nThat might be why I said \"ARE YOU SUGGESTING\"...And 40 million child-adults would be taken care of just the same as if they were born. How do you know it wouldn't stimulate the economy because of a higher demand?\n\n \n Unlikely as the needs would be handled primarily by the public sector. Your suggestions aren't even similar to what I'm talking about.",

People who were aborted have no age! . You can't be 60 if you were aborted in 1976 as you were never born! \n \n How can someone have a age when they were never born? \n \n Oh, my pet dog that was never born is 50 years old today! :p",

   "Consider that 90% of personal income taxes are paid by 10% of taxpayers. If ten abortions are foregone, simple math using IRS tax paying demographics shows one substantial taxpayer, two who will carry their own weight, one who is break even, four who will take more from society than they contribute and two who will live on the system. \n \n It doesn't matter how large GDP is, it has to contain adequate tax base to operate government services and at least a neutral trade balance. Under our present structure moving towards socialism, a majority of those who forgo abortion will be creating society dependent population.

I would argue that the person is just as much of a person worth living as anyone else in any scenario.
