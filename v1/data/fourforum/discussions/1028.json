   "HETEROSEXUAL QUESTIONNAIRE\n \u00a9 Martin Rochlin, Ph.D. \n \n This questionnaire is for self-avowed heterosexuals only. If you are not openly heterosexual, pass it on to a friend who is. Please try to answer the questions as candidly as possible. Your responses will be held in strict confidence and your anonymity fully protected.\n \n 1. What do you think caused your heterosexuality? Natural, nondeleterious biological traits, You could say nature. You see all organisms proximal purpose is to reproduce therefore to be sexual with a partner with which you may reproduce is natural. \n \n 2. When and how did you first decide you were a heterosexual?\n When i learned the definition and realised that it applied to me because I was sexually attracted to the opposite sex.\n 3. Is it possible your heterosexuality is just a phase you may grow out of?\n That is doubtful since it is the way nature made a properly oriented organism.\n \n 4. Could it be that your heterosexuality stems from a neurotic fear of others of the same sex?\n Again doubtful since I have many friends of my same sex.\n \n 5. If you've never slept with a person of the same sex, how can you be sure you wouldn't prefer that? \n I am repulsed by the thought of it. That is a good indication that I would not like it.\n \n 6. To whom have you disclosed your heterosexual tendencies? How did they react?\n All that I know, my spouse in particular, especially since our bodies are compatible and meant to engage in sexual activity. It is quite obvious that a penis and a vagina are complimentary structures.\n \n 7. Why do heterosexuals feel compelled to seduce others into their lifestyle?\n Perhaps like all other organisms they have an aversion to mutation or less fit organisims. Before you blow your top, when I say fit I am using the definition of population genetics.\n \n 8. Why do you insist on flaunting your heterosexuality? Can't you just be what you are and keep it quiet?\n I do not flaunt it, I have never specificaly told someone that I am heterosexual, nor do I feel that it is necessary. Nor have I thrown it in thier face so to speak.\n \n 9. Would you want your children to be heterosexual, knowing the problems they'd face?\n Yes, if it is a problem to reproduce and raise you own children then nature has one major problem.\n \n 10. A disproportionate majority of child molesters are heterosexual men. Do you consider it safe to expose children to heterosexual male teachers, pediatricians, priests, or scoutmasters? \n You did not ask the valid question that is really at the root of this issue so I will do that for you. \"Do you consider it safe to expose children to and have them in the unsupervised care of teachers, pediatricians, priests, or scoutmasters that are sexually attracted to people of your child's sex? Answer is No I do not consider it safe. Neither to leave my girl with a heterosexual male nor my boy with a homosexual male. \n \n \n 11. With all the societal support for marriage, the divorce rate is spiraling. Why are there so few stable relationships among heterosexuals?\n Because our society has a distorted view of marriage and what is really of worth. I could be much more specific here but this is the underlying reason.\n \n 12. Why do heterosexuals place so much emphasis on sex?\n It is the way we propagate our species as well as express love for our spouse. At least these are the correct reasons for sex.\n \n 13. Considering the menace of overpopulation, how could the human race survive if everyone were heterosexual?\n Just as it does and has since the dawn of man.\n \n 14. Could you trust a heterosexual therapist to be objective? Don't you fear s/he might be inclined to influence you in the direction of her/his own leanings?\n Therapists are rarely objective thier paradigm will always influence their work. So the real question is do you agree with their paradigm?\n \n 15. Heterosexuals are notorious for assigning themselves and one another rigid, stereotyped sex roles. Why must you cling to such unhealthy role-playing?\n Because of the physical difference between the sexual organs of males and females and the way in which we engage in reproduction. THese two factors consign us to specific sexual roles. Once again nature rears its ugly head.\n \n 16. With the sexually segregated living conditions of military life, isn't heterosexuality incompatible with military service?\n No, however it may be incompatible with having sex with the opposite sex. Which is not what the millitary is for. \n \n 17. How can you enjoy an emotionally fulfilling experience with a person of the other sex when there are such vast differences between you? How can a man know what pleases a woman sexually or vice-versa?\n An inane question that deserves no answer for it is obvious. \n \n 18. Shouldn't you ask your far-out straight cohorts, like skinheads and born-agains, to keep quiet? Wouldn't that improve your image?\n It may.\n \n 19. Why are heterosexuals so promiscuous?\n Because society is losing its moral base.\n \n 20. Why do you attribute heterosexuality to so many famous lesbian and gay people? Is it to justify your own heterosexuality?\n It is probably because most people are heterosexuals as it is the natural way to be born, therefore we assume that a person is heterosexual untill evidence shows otherwise.\n \n 21. How can you hope to actualize your God-given homosexual potential if you limit yourself to exclusive, compulsive heterosexuality? \n There is no evidence that God desires us to be homosexual, there is however evidence to the contrary.\n \n 22. There seem to be very few happy heterosexuals. Techniques have been developed that might enable you to change if you really want to. After all, you never deliberately chose to be a heterosexual, did you? Have you considered aversion therapy?\n Heterosexuality is the natural way of sexuality as evidenced by reproductive methods as well as societal necessities therefore this question has no logical basis.",

Which is, of course, absurd. Hence the satire.\n \n Therefore, to the homophobe, one might direct the question, \"Have you ever tried pedophilia? Or bestiality?
