Since we don't have slaves anymore (at least out in the open), then we shouldn't have racism, either. But humans are mostly stupid, and want to adhere to the most ridiculous traditions possible. This is why people still think that there is a \"white race,\" and a \"black race.\"\n \n Collectively, humans need to realize that there is only one master race, and that is the \"human race.\" But we should all probably stop and figure out just what it is we're \"racing\" towards.",

   "Actually it was good to hear a positive word gman. I needed that because this crowd is so oppressive in their negativity and anti americanism that one can start to feel totally outnumbered and alone. I do feel that the dems will once again defeat themselves in November and wasn't implying that we have only months left. But I do believe we have only a limited number of years left as a Nation. \n \n And where as people like capO used to be a very closeted minority who would never publicly admit they were a neo-marxist socialist, today they proudly proclaim it and wear it as a badge of honor. More evidence of the reprobate condition of the soul of America.\n\n \n The fact is Angel, most of the people they represent, have not an inkling of what they speak of. These are the people who see themselves as intellectuals. This forum is the best they have to offer. Most have no idea of what the real issues or answers are. That of course does work in the favor of those who champion degradation as the norm. Most folks love to hear how their perverse activity is a normal and healthy thing. \n I agree that they will eventually overwhelm us on this planet, however we have that inner peace that helps us deal with the ultimate outcome. They comfort themselves with self righteousness supported by nothing more than situational ethics. They can justify anything. They have convinced the officials of American courts that the destruction of life due to it's inability to voice it's natural instinct to survive that they are less important than the \"right\" of an irresponsible persons right to choose. While arguing vehemently to save the life of a person who has ignored the right to life and stolen that life of their murdered victim. \n Be sure, your's is the high ground they can only gaze up at from their position in the pit.",

   "Actually.....? I believe nothing will change. \n Even if you pump more money into it, things would not change.\n Law enforcement always takes the easy bust. When they focus on a suspect, they instantly get tunnel vision.\n I don't have any problem with executing criminals. I do understand your point of view. I don't want innocent people harmed. The problem we have is law enforcement people performing half heartedly. If I performed my duties in the same manner, I would be unemployed. Penalties should be arranged for prosecutors, police officers, judges who make mistakes that take innocent lives.\n\n The problem is that the whole of society is geared to wanting 'someone' to pay for the crime that has been committed. At times there seems little interest in it being the person who is actually responsible.\n \n It appears that revenge is often much more important than justice.\n \n Having said that, what is justice? Justice is far to subjective.\n \n Smiley",
