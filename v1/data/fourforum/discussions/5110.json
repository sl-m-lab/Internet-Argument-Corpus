   "AP Enterprise: Records show frequent contact between DeLay, lobbyist\n Wednesday April 27 2005 7:27\n \n WASHINGTON (AP) - Over two years, Rep. Tom DeLay had at least two dozen discussions with a lobbyist working to keep a U.S. territory's factories free from new labor laws. The lobbyist contributed to the House leader's campaigns and arranged travel for him.\n \n Records show that DeLay's staff spoke with the lobbyist, Jack Abramoff, or his team almost daily during this period.\n \n DeLay's office kept Abramoff, now under criminal investigation, routinely apprised of congressional efforts to block new regulations on his client, the Northern Mariana Islands.\n \n Questions have been raised about whether Abramoff himself paid for some of DeLay's foreign trips in violation of House rules. DeLay maintains they were properly financed by trip sponsors.\n \n Abramoff's firm reported it drafted legislative materials for DeLay, and Abramoff boasted to island leaders he could use his close ties to Republican leaders to block legislation from receiving a House vote.\n \n snip\n \n http://www.kmbz.com/listingsEntry.a...ional+Headlines\n \n Sweatshop abuses in US island territory\n By Shannon Jones\n 2 April, 1998\n \n Immigrant workers and federal investigators described horrific abuses and conditions of virtual slavery in testimony before a US Senate committee hearing March 31 on the treatment of workers in the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands. CNMI is a Western Pacific territory administered by the United States.\n \n The Marianas were a major battleground between the United States and Japan in World War II, and the atomic bombing of Hiroshima was carried out from a base in Tinian, part of the island chain. Today the Marianas serve as a base for garment manufacturing and a sex-tourism industry catering to Asian businessmen whose owners have reaped hefty profits by brutally exploiting immigrant workers. The victims, mostly from mainland China, are lured by employers with false promises of a better life. \n \n Immigrant workers on the island outnumber US citizens by about 35,000 to 27,000. Those who come to Marianas often pay thousands of dollars to middlemen, who tell them they will arrange good-paying jobs in America. Some 20,000 of these immigrants are crowded into barracks that resemble forced labor camps. Many lack running water, adequate toilets or proper ventilation.\n \n snip\n \n A similar reaction was voiced by a powerful Republican congressman, House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, who took a New Year's junket to the islands and spoke at a banquet sponsored by one of the biggest garment manufacturers, Willie Tan. DeLay hailed the sweatshop industry as a \"free market success\" and denounced the proposed labor legislation as an effort to \"kill economic freedom.\"\n \n A favorite of the Christian fundamentalists, DeLay presented the defense these barbaric conditions as a moral imperative. He told his audience, which profits from sweatshop exploitation and forced prostitution: \"Stand firm. Resist evil. Remember that all truth and blessings emanate from our Creator.\" He went on to declare that he favored creating a similar \"guest worker program\" for Mexicans in the United States that would eliminate the minimum wage.\n \n http://www.wsws.org/news/1998/apr1998/mari-a02.shtml\n \n Records detail DeLay's ties to lobbyist\n U.S. territory seeking labor law exemption was client\n Dennis Cook / AP\n Jack Abramoff, right, listens to his attorney during a Senate Indian Affairs Committee hearing in Sept. 2004. In addition to having lobbied for the Northern Mariana Islands, Abramoff has worked on behalf of the National Indian Gaming Commission, a job that's also come under scrutiny. \n \n By Sharon Theimer\n The Associated Press\n Updated: 8:04 p.m. ET April 27, 2005WASHINGTON - Over two years, House Majority leader Tom DeLay had at least two dozen discussions with a lobbyist working to keep a U.S. territory's factories free from new labor laws.

   "Right on target. Delay pretends to be a pious Christian that can pontificate down to the rest of us sinners about morals. The reality is the Christian faction of the Republican Party only represent votes and campaign contributions. What would happen if the Devil showed up and told Delay he could make him president in 2008 for the cost of his soul? \n \n How Christian is this? People are being treated like animals with 12 hours a day of work, 7 days a week, living in huts with no running water, surrounded by barbed wire and armed guards, and many of the workers as young as 12 yrs. old.\n \n Kinda like his role model charging others with human rights violations and preaching down at others about freedom, democracy, etc... What great international diplomacy from a position of no personal integrity or credibility. \n \n Bush Republicans get offended at any criticism, so let me end with a compliment.
