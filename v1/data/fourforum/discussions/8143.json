   "Editorial in Newsweek this european issue.\n \n \nEuropeans distrust the moralizing tone of American policy. They remember how President Bush threw down the gantlet over Iraq: \"Those who are not for us are against us.\" Now comes McCain proclaiming that Iranian nuclear weapons are a \"moral issue\" on which we must be uncompromising. And not just Iran. McCain outlined an agenda reminiscent of the early days of the Bush administration. The overall imperative is to spread democracy. To that end we must increase U.S. troop numbers in Iraq, strengthen NATO forces in Afghanistan, force a halt to the slaughter in Darfur, press Putin's Russia on its domestic and international behavior, push for regime change in Belarus, stabilize the Balkans and expand the EU to include Turkey and Serbia, while extending NATO through Ukraine all the way to Georgia.\n\n I've read Moravcsiks articles for many years and I like his tone. It gives alot of reassurance differing from the US statesman \"We lead, you follow.\" spiel. McCain had up to this time in my limited view come on as a saner voice in a cabinet who belives itself to be Rome version 2. I wonder how reality just continously fails to catch up to these people? Do they really think the rest of the world consists of utterly morose sycophants?",

The Republican Central Party, in spite of current administration's dismal failures, is still bound by the Petrodollar and a direction dictated by that factor using Wolfowitz's blueprint for US hegemony. Without central party's blessing, which requires adherence to their policies, McCain will not have access to their funding as a presidential candidate. They said jump, he asked how high.",
