   "There are billions of dollars involved in an \"adoption\" of the ToE, along with immeasurable power and reputation. Probably the largest percentage of it is in the commercial research and application in the medical industry.\n\n \n Perhaps so. But you realize that the reason it gets used in medicine is because it works. Did you know, for example, that clindamycin, an antibiotic, can be used to safely kill certain non-bacterial parasites? Do you know why? Check out Carl Zimmer's excellent Parasite Rex for the answer.\n \n \nSo much of it, stem cell research, abortion, \"right to die\", animal rights, etc. take on a different political shift when science becomes God. The moral values of the Judeo Christian religion simply get in the way of so much that science wants to do. Tons of money and power hang in the balance. \n\n \n Here you are running together a whole lot of things. I would like to know what you see as the detailed connections between the science of evolution and the questions of (1) whether we ought to perform research on embryonic stem cells; (2) whether abortion ought to be legal; (3) whether euthanasia ought to be legal; and (4) how we ought to treat animals. Because as I see it, these are questions of value, and evolutionary biology doesn't decide them one way or the other.\n \n \nEverybody doesn't. Most in science do because Darwinism is the standard that has been set. Those who practice science set some basic standards and then follow certain paths, and don't like to be questioned about those paths.\n\n \n Or maybe -- just maybe -- they think that evolution is the best available path to pursue? This line of criticism, about how evolutionists don't like to be questioned, is thoroughly ad hominem: it addresses the matter in terms of the personality traits -- the alleged personality traits, more accurately -- of evolutionary biologists, rather than in terms of whether the evolutionary research program really is the most fruitful one to follow.\n \n Meanwhile, so long as we're playing the ad hominem game, couldn't one say much the same thing about a great many theologians? When was the last time a conservative Christian seminary let a Jew teach the students the meaning of Genesis and Exodus, or allowed an atheist to teach the early history of Christian doctrine?\n \n \nIt's not possible for humans to soundly prove or disprove what happened before recorded history.\n\n \n Which in no way implies that all hypotheses about what happened before recorded history are equally well-supported.\n \n \nMany have tried to successfully build a career on the questioning of the ToE. They're discriminated against, treated rudely, and largely ignored, but they exist.\n\n \n How are they discriminated against? Because they don't get published? Well, when they try to publish something that has scientific merit, they will get published.\n \n How are they treated rudely? It is not rude to tell someone that his ideas are wrong.\n \n Take Behe, for example. His central concept is \"irreducible complexity\": some phenomena are too complex to be explained by evolution, because if you removed any of their parts, they'd no longer work. But every example the man has ever given -- every example, ever -- doesn't work!\n \n It is certainly true that if you remove a single piece from, say, a bacterial flagellum, it will no longer work. But no one disputes that! The issue is, just because it could not now work as a flagellum, that does not mean it could not earlier have worked as something else. And empirical examples of what appear to be arrested or reduced flagella have been produced. So the complexity involved is quite reducible, and Behe's argument fails.\n \n The only person I've seen getting rude about all that is Behe himself. He makes indignant declarations about how all these opponents don't understand him at all, and launches ad hominem attacks on their motives and character: they're all just lockstep with the Darwinian orthodoxy, and they don't care about the truth.\n \n As for \"largely ignoring\" them, this is partly true. They don't get published in the scientific journals. But their articles are rejected, not ignored. And for reasons such as those above.\n \n But it is very hard to say that they're \"ignored\" at all, considering how much attention they seek, and get.\n \n \nIt's not something that happened overnight - philosophers like Herbert Spencer and Thomas Huxley have been spreading social implications of Evolution ever since Darwin wrote \"Origin Of Species\".\n\n \n Herbert Spencer has become famous for his \"Social Darwinism.\" But the irony here is, Spencer was pushing his ideas for more than a decade BEFORE the Origin was published. It is a mischaracterization of history to claim that Spencer's ideas have anything to do with the \"implications\" of evolution at all.\n \n And as for Spencer's ideas concerning religion, morality, and policy -- or Huxley's, or anyone else's for that matter -- these simply do not follow from evolution. Alfred Russell Wallace, who discovered the principle of natural selection independently of Darwin, and whose work spurred Darwin to publish the Origin when he did, was a Christian and a socialist.\n \n Compare Wallace to Huxley and Spencer, and then consider whether evolution necessarily leads to conservatism or leftism, capitalism or communism, theism or atheism.\n \n (As an ironic sidenote, let me point out that most of the American creationists I've ever met favor right-wing economic policies that are very similar to those advocated by Spencer -- even as they decry Darwinism for its allegedly Spencerian connections.)\n \n \nThere doesn't have to be a defined \"shot calling\" leadership of it any more than there has to be one in Judeo Christianity. The two are actually comparable - Christianity gets its leadership/organization through Biblical reference and church leadership. Evolution gets its leadership/organization through the philosophical writings of everyone from Herbert Spencer to Richard Dawkins.\n\n \n And as I said, Herbert Spencer's ideas predate Darwin's. Meanwhile, Dawkins writings on religion are irrelevant to whether evolution is good biology.\n \n \nIt's established in university administrations and peer review. That's the \"top\" - that's where the leadership is.\n\n \n Really? So, university presidents and trustees -- the overwhelming majority of whom have no connection with evolution, and most of whom are considerably more politically conservative than university faculties -- are behind the whole thing? Wow.\n \n You know, this sort of claim requires evidence. I would like see your evidence of university administration involvement. Got any?\n \n And who are the \"top\" in the peer-review process? Editors? Please explain what you mean.\n \n \nThere is a conflict between religion and science.\n\n \n NO. There is a conflict between science and some forms of religion. By no means is there a conflict between science and religion, in and of itself.\n \n \nIf the scientific community pretends there is not...\n\n \n It doesn't, at least not in the sense just provided.\n \n \nit raises questions about how many other things they are less than honest about.\n\n \n I wondered much the same thing after reading Philip Johnson's Darwin on Trial.",

Check out Carl Zimmer's excellent Parasite Rex for the answer. \n\n \n So you're saying we would not have clindamycin without the ToE? \n \n The ToE is supposed to be defined as changes in alleles, not changes in anything someone wishes to assign it to. It seems that in addition to the term evolution being broadened to mean just about any change, it is also substituted for the word \"science\" at will. Notice how it was done in post #2 above. The word \"evolution\" was dropped, and the word \"science\" replaced it. \n \n What are the possibilities that evolution is \"brought in as a narrative gloss\" after a discovery, rather than being a cornerstone of all of biology, or all of science? \n \n CSC - Why Do We Invoke Darwin?\n \n \n \nHere you are running together a whole lot of things. I would like to know what you see as the detailed connections between the science of evolution and the questions of (1) whether we ought to perform research on embryonic stem cells; (2) whether abortion ought to be legal; (3) whether euthanasia ought to be legal; and (4) how we ought to treat animals. Because as I see it, these are questions of value, and evolutionary biology doesn't decide them one way or the other. \n\n \n Often, when political or court decisions are made concerning those things, evolutionary biologists are consulted. The above book by Pamela Winnick shows a lot about how science and politics are not always separate from each other. And here's another helpful link;\n \n The Myth of Secular Neutrality: Unbiased Bioethics? - Biology Online\n \n \nOr maybe -- just maybe -- they think that evolution is the best available path to pursue? This line of criticism, about how evolutionists don't like to be questioned, is thoroughly ad hominem: it addresses the matter in terms of the personality traits -- the alleged personality traits, more accurately -- of evolutionary biologists, rather than in terms of whether the evolutionary research program really is the most fruitful one to follow. \n \n Meanwhile, so long as we're playing the ad hominem game, couldn't one say much the same thing about a great many theologians?

I probably just happen to notice evolutionists arrogance towards religion more than you do. :)\n \n \nHow are they treated rudely? It is not rude to tell someone that his ideas are wrong.\n \n Take Behe, for example. His central concept is \"irreducible complexity\": some phenomena are too complex to be explained by evolution, because if you removed any of their parts, they'd no longer work.

And empirical examples of what appear to be arrested or reduced flagella have been produced. So the complexity involved is quite reducible, and Behe's argument fails. \n\n \n It doesn't fail, it shows a lesser probability of Godless evolution. Showing a lesser probability of something that is supposed to have happened by randomness millions of years ago is notable. Behe's main example was a mousetrap - if we really want to, we can assume that before the wooden base evolved, the earlier arriving metal parts were used as.....footwarmers for mice. Or just something pretty and shiny for mice to look at. But it's not likely. \n \n \nThe only person I've seen getting rude about all that is Behe himself. He makes indignant declarations about how all these opponents don't understand him at all, and launches ad hominem attacks on their motives and character: they're all just lockstep with the Darwinian orthodoxy, and they don't care about the truth. \n\n \n If you really think Behe was the instigator of rudeness, you're just not being realistic. He probably ranks right up there as being one of the most personally attacked scientists who ever lived. \n \n \nAs for \"largely ignoring\" them, this is partly true. They don't get published in the scientific journals. But their articles are rejected, not ignored. And for reasons such as those above. \n\n \n This goes back to what my link above referenced, there is no neutrality. If I told you I was about to write something about evolution, would you have a pretty good idea, before reading it, about whether or not you were going to reject it? \n \n \nHerbert Spencer has become famous for his \"Social Darwinism.\" But the irony here is, Spencer was pushing his ideas for more than a decade BEFORE the Origin was published. It is a mischaracterization of history to claim that Spencer's ideas have anything to do with the \"implications\" of evolution at all. \n\n \n Herbert Spencer - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n \nSpencer developed an all-embracing conception of evolution as the progressive development of the physical world, biological organisms, the human mind, and human culture and societies. \n\n \n Who is misrepresenting history? emoticon_confused\n \n \n \nAnd as for Spencer's ideas concerning religion, morality, and policy -- or Huxley's, or anyone else's for that matter -- these simply do not follow from evolution. Alfred Russell Wallace, who discovered the principle of natural selection independently of Darwin, and whose work spurred Darwin to publish the Origin when he did, was a Christian and a socialist.\n \n Compare Wallace to Huxley and Spencer, and then consider whether evolution necessarily leads to conservatism or leftism, capitalism or communism, theism or atheism.\n \n (As an ironic sidenote, let me point out that most of the American creationists I've ever met favor right-wing economic policies that are very similar to those advocated by Spencer -- even as they decry Darwinism for its allegedly Spencerian connections.) \n\n \n I've gone over these social Darwinists in an earlier debate a year or two ago, I don't feel like digging all that up again. \n \n \nAnd as I said, Herbert Spencer's ideas predate Darwin's. Meanwhile, Dawkins writings on religion are irrelevant to whether evolution is good biology. \n\n \n That's another double standard that always seems to arise - Authors like Pamela Winnick, William Dembski and many others who question evolution are often dismissed because of their personal beliefs. Yet the personal beliefs of rabid atheists who express an interest in destroying religion are given a free pass in the scientific community. \n \n \nReally? So, university presidents and trustees -- the overwhelming majority of whom have no connection with evolution, and most of whom are considerably more politically conservative than university faculties -- are behind the whole thing? Wow.\n \n You know, this sort of claim requires evidence. I would like see your evidence of university administration involvement. Got any? \n\n \n You're a good new poster, but you're asking questions of me that I've gone into detail about in other threads here. That's not a problem, but I'm sometimes going to simply refer you to other threads, rather than repeat myself. It's quite detailed. Have you ever heard of David Horowitz? I've used him as a source for some of the alarming things that are going on in todays universities. The one place here that I put together my most complete case is here.\n \n \nNO. There is a conflict between science and some forms of religion. By no means is there a conflict between science and religion, in and of itself. \n\n \n There wouldn't be, if there was neutrality - if politics wasn't involved - if scientists worldviews had any kind of similarity with those of the general public. But there isn't, it is, and they don't. So there is a conflict. \n \n \nI wondered much the same thing after reading Philip Johnson's Darwin on Trial.\n\n \n I don't have that book, but I have one of his others.

   "There are billions of dollars involved in an \"adoption\" of the ToE, along with immeasurable power and reputation. Probably the largest percentage of it is in the commercial research and application in the medical industry. So much of it, stem cell research, abortion, \"right to die\", animal rights, etc. take on a different political shift when science becomes God. The moral values of the Judeo Christian religion simply get in the way of so much that science wants to do. Tons of money and power hang in the balance. \n \n \n \n Everybody doesn't. Most in science do because Darwinism is the standard that has been set. Those who practice science set some basic standards and then follow certain paths, and don't like to be questioned about those paths. The funding and social ramifications of it all are comparable politically to the auto industry controversy. \n \n \n \n It's not possible for humans to soundly prove or disprove what happened before recorded history. Many have tried to successfully build a career on the questioning of the ToE. They're discriminated against, treated rudely, and largely ignored, but they exist. \n \n \n \n It's not something that happened overnight - philosophers like Herbert Spencer and Thomas Huxley have been spreading social implications of Evolution ever since Darwin wrote \"Origin Of Species\". There doesn't have to be a defined \"shot calling\" leadership of it any more than there has to be one in Judeo Christianity. The two are actually comparable - Christianity gets its leadership/organization through Biblical reference and church leadership. Evolution gets its leadership/organization through the philosophical writings of everyone from Herbert Spencer to Richard Dawkins. It's established in university administrations and peer review. That's the \"top\" - that's where the leadership is. \n \n There is a conflict between religion and science. If the scientific community pretends there is not, it raises questions about how many other things they are less than honest about. \n \n \n \n It has been, and continues to be, pulled off. Here on Amazon, scroll down and read the description, then the three reviews of this book.\n\n \n One point to clarify is that - grants of money come from gov't. Gov't has a vested interest in setting the moral code of a nation. Human chattle rather than soveriegn citizens make their power and control grow exponentially.\n A Constitutional Republic required officials to be elected to serve the people. Now we have gov't officials to rule the people. Does anyone understand the difference? Not likely, because the gov't grants support ways to teach children what to think not how to think.\n \n Clean science is about 2+2=4 no matter what your belief system is. But if gov't says that 2+2=4 because the belief system was  a result of no God - then anyone who agrees - gets money to convince the masses that belief in God would make 2+2=anything.\n \n That is why Nova has to say something like - \"...over millions of years this organism adapted to accomplish 'x' in its environment.\" They say it over and over again even though there is NO legitamate clue as to how 'they adapted'. And that will never be admitted to or they lose their funding.\n \n So what is the end result? Gov't establishes moral truth and killing of undesirables is for \"The Greater Good\"\n Can anyone say: Meglomaniac?",

   "So you're saying we would not have clindamycin without the ToE?\n\n \n Nope. I'm saying that we wouldn't understand why clindamycin works on anything other than bacteria, like most other antibiotics. Because as it happens, clindamycin can be used on some eukaryotic parasites, namely Toxoplasma, the cause of toxoplasmosis, and Plasmodium, the cause of malaria. And it works without destroying host cells or their mitochondria. This is because it turns out that Toxoplasma and Plasmodium contain organelles that were once chloroplasts, as can be shown by these organelles' DNA.\n \n When Intelligent Design (or any other form of creationism) comes up with an explanation for how chloroplasts wind up in a non-photosynthetic organism at all, or for why the DNA of these organelles so closely resembles that of chloroplasts if there is no relationship between them, then I will fall to my knees and sing the glories of ID. But my hunch is that all ID can say on the matter is, \"It is so, thanks to the inscrutable intentions of the creator.\" Which may be true, I suppose, but which cannot reasonably called an \"explanation\" of anything.\n \n \nWhat are the possibilities that evolution is \"brought in as a narrative gloss\" after a discovery, rather than being a cornerstone of all of biology, or all of science?\n\n \n Not very good. The Discovery Institute article is dead wrong. Even sticking to the example I've given above, evolution has lead to hypotheses about what other sorts of non-bacterial illnesses clindamycin and other similar antibiotics can treat, as well as suggesting hypotheses about how to improve the treatment of the non-bacterial illnesses we already know it can. The generation of further hypotheses is hardly what I would call mere \"narrative gloss.\"\n \n Meanwhile, so what if some research projects don't have direct evolutionary input? The double helical structure of DNA, for example, doesn't require evolution in order to be discovered and observed. But what about explaining it? No one ever said that evolution was going to be directly relevant to every aspect of every project. This hardly changes the fact that it is directly relevant to many aspects of many projects, and secondarily relevant to many more. So the author's point is really quite pointless.\n \n And his comments about the irrelevance of Darwinian natural selection to antibiotic and pesticide resistance studies is... well, I mean, wow. One wonders who exactly were the \"biologists\" he \"queried\" about this. Citations of literature would be nice; I will leave it to you to decide what it means that he offered none.\n \n \nOften, when political or court decisions are made concerning those things, evolutionary biologists are consulted. The above book by Pamela Winnick shows a lot about how science and politics are not always separate from each other.\n\n \n And how does the book show any connection between the explanations of evolutionary biology and the particular prescriptions for or against any particular answer to those value questions? The excerpt on Amazon offered no such connection.\n \n I've been reading Michael Ruse's Darwinism and Its Discontents. In the opening to one chapter, he points out that Darwinism has been criticized by opposite sides for precisely opposed moral reasons. He cites an excellent pair: Phillip Johnson is a conservative and a Christian; he opposes Darwinism because he thinks it subverts traditional values. Richard Lewontin is a Marxist and an atheist; he opposes Darwinism because he thinks it supports traditional values.\n \n Which is just to show that, trying to draw a straight line between Darwinian evolution and particular answers to particular questions of value simply can't be done. Which is really no surprise: in philosophy, we call this the \"Is-Ought\" distinction. Maybe you should read up on that.\n \n Meanwhile, the \"secular neutrality is a myth\" article had nary a thing to say on using evolution to justify ethical positions, which makes it totally irrelevant to the point at issue here. It was, however, another ironic example of conservative Christianity's slide into self-undermining relativism. \"All bioethics are biased?\" Well, okay. How exactly does that help her own case about what bioethics ought to be? For she, too, must be biased!\n \n \nA conservative Christian seminary isn't a public entity that falls under the establishment clause of the first amendment like most US universities, and public education.\n\n \n How is that relevant? Public universities teach evolution. By no means does this conflict with all religious views. And for those whose religious views are offended, they are not required to accept anything about evolution.\n \n The idea is that if students are going to take a biology class, then they have to come away with an understanding of biology. Part of what that means is, they will have to study evolution, and they will be graded on how well they understand it. If they are so inclined, they may choose to reject what biology says about evolution for non-biological reasons, e.g. because they believe a literal interpretation of Genesis is true. But at least now they'll understand what they're rejecting. And of course, just because they understand the biological idea they reject, that doesn't mean that their rejection is itself a biological idea.\n \n If you can show me how any of that violates the 1st Amendment's Establishment Clause, by all means do so.\n \n \n[Behe's irreducible complexity argument] doesn't fail, it shows a lesser probability of Godless evolution. Showing a lesser probability of something that is supposed to have happened by randomness millions of years ago is notable.\n\n \n I'm afraid all Behe can show is that evolution doesn't produce extremely complex features in a single step. But nobody ever disputed that. And he certainly didn't show that in order to produce extremely complex features via very many steps over a long period of time, one must invoke intelligence.\n \n \nThis goes back to what my link above referenced, there is no neutrality.\n\n \n Which is a self-undermining tactic: Since your opponents cannot be neutral, why should they try? Since you cannot be neutral, why should anyone think you're any less biased than they are? Heck, if bias is unavoidable, why even think it's bad?\n \n Like I said, the article is just another example of conservative Christianity's sadly ironic slide into relativism.\n \n \nIf I told you I was about to write something about evolution, would you have a pretty good idea, before reading it, about whether or not you were going to reject it?\n\n \n Sure I would. But it's precisely to avoid this kind of bias that peer review is done blind. Reviewers don't know whose work they're reviewing, so they can't let their pre-judgements about an author influence their assessments of the merits of his work.\n \n Regarding Herbert Spence, I had written:\n \n \n [Me:] Herbert Spencer has become famous for his \"Social Darwinism.\" But the irony here is, Spencer was pushing his ideas for more than a decade BEFORE the Origin was published. It is a mischaracterization of history to claim that Spencer's ideas have anything to do with the \"implications\" of evolution at all.\n\n \n You then cite the Wikipedia entry on Spencer:\n \n \n[Wikipedia:] Spencer developed an all-embracing conception of evolution as the progressive development of the physical world, biological organisms, the human mind, and human culture and societies.\n\n \n And then you ask:\n \n \nWho is misrepresenting history? emoticon_confused\n\n \n I'm afraid that you are. Spencer's own position has nothing to do with how evolutionary biology works. He developed it prior to the publication of Darwin's Origin (1859), beginning with Social Statics (1851) and maturing by the publication of \"Progress: Its Law and Cause\" (1857).\n \n And as is noted in the remainder of the very Wikipedia article you cite:\n \n \n[Wikipedia:] But although after reading Darwin's work he coined the phrase 'survival of the fittest' as his own term for Darwin's concept, and is often misrepresented as a thinker who merely applied the Darwinian theory to society, he only grudgingly incorporated natural selection into his preexisting overall system. The primary mechanism of species transformation that he recognized was Lamarckian use-inheritance which posited that organs are developed or are diminished by use or disuse and that the resulting changes may be transmitted to future generations.\n\n \n Spencer's version of evolution is not even Darwin's, let alone the refined Darwinian version employed in contermporary biology. So as I said, I think you're mischaracterizing history. No emoticon_confused necessary.",

(High school class of '92.) But what they didn't do was teach the religious explanation in a science class. It was taught in a history class, concerning religion and value systems.\n \n And here's how it was taught: Christian narratives and doctrines were discussed with attention to sectarian diversity. Christian narratives and doctrines were discussed alongside those of non-Christian religions and the option of no religion at all. Students were not required to accept any particular sect or religion or ir/religious idea. Nor were they required to accept any particular view of the compatibility of religion and science.\n \n As a result, it was readily apparent that there were far more options than just two. And every student in the room was thereby forced to think.\n \n The only drawback I can see to the way this class was handled was, it was merely an elective rather than a required course, so only 10% of the 400-500 of my high school's yearly grads ever took it. For those of us who did take it, though, it was an extraordinary experience.\n \n If creationists were content to promote classes like the non-proselytizing, non-science class I described above, then even I would be on their side.

When I pressed her for an answer, she admitted that evolution made more sense to her, but her tests would be based only us knowing the material covered in class, not whether we believed or accepted any of it as factual.\n \n OH for the days when schools taught children how to think, but not what to think. That is the reason for education after all, or it once was I should say. But today our children are told what to think, and if any of them have the convictions or personal fortitude to question what they are being spoonfed, they are excoriated as brainwashed and ignorant pawns of religious dogma which will be the destruction of a civilized society. The freedom to think and consider alternatives no longer exists in todays America.\n \n And what these young promoters of evolution here are totally unaware of is that debates went on and warnings were sounded 30 and 40 years ago that if education continued as the secular humanists were directing it back then, that within one or two generations we would be precisely where we are today with a closed education system which denies children the option of even making an individual choice after having just received the known facts of what these opposing theories represent.\n\n \n \nThank you Smallax. And I didn't rewrite or reinterpret history at all in order to summarize how far down that slippery slope of secular humanism we have slid since I was a student in school. How fearful and paranoid the opposition is not to value and respect free thought, but to support and endorse imposing a particular way of thinking as they demand that society walk lock step to their distorted world view. \n \n And remember that these are the same people who will scream for free speech, but only if that speech agrees with them. My question is, if they are so confident in what they claim to be true, why do they feel the need to quench and erase all other belief systems which they disagree with? What harm does it do to have a variety of belief systems and philosophies? How exactly does one believing that God created life threaten the alleged science of evolution when its proponents insist it doesn't even deal with the origin of life, but only with the evolution of it?\n \n Every argument they make in support of their religion of evolution belies the fact that they have declared war on Creationism which should be no threat at all to them if what they are saying evolution represents is true. But of course we know it isn't true. It is a shell game of opposing claims and conclusions which is as fluid as the ocean. It moves from here to there depending on what valid objections we raise or the contradictions we point out. And what is so incredible is that this is their version of truth and science. emoticon_rolleyes Go figure, huh...\n",

   "What is ironic is that first of all, you see my posts as a ridiculous rant.\nYes. Your posts are typically quite ridiculous and most usually just rants with lots of meaningless quotes from your book of mythology.\n \nAnd secondly that you can claim that Christians are seeking the proliferation of our our religion BY FORCE, when all we are doing is opposing your attempts to marginalize all semblance of traditional morality in America.\nThere have been efforts by creationists to impose their religion into religion classes my whole life. First there were efforts to exclude the teaching of biology from biology classes and to replace it with religious magic. Then there were efforts for \"equal time\" for the idiocy of \"creation science.\" More recently, there were the efforts by the Kansas State Board of Education to remove evolution from the curriculum (yet again) and thereby reduce biology to a series of unrelated observations to memorize. And of course, there was the Dover, PA school board that tried to force their religion into biology classes. Most of these have been decided by court cases, wasting public money on court cases the could have been decided with just a little thought in the first place. In all cases, the religion of creationism has been prohibited from science classes. Idiocy does not merit equal time with science.\n \nCan you show where we are calling for Christianity being mad [sic] an official State Religion in America as Atheists and secular humanists are attempting to legislate their godless religions in both the Courts and the Congress?\nBut I didn't say that. I said that creationists are trying to force their religion on everyone. As mentioned above, in the schools. Chief Justice Moore of the Alabama Supreme court placed a huge erection that memorialized religion in the court building. And there have been efforts to establish a national religion. In fact, at the time that the Constitution was written, most states had established, official state religions. We've been listening to so called christians whining about a christian nation ever since.\n \n Again you post without thought. It's pretty silly to claim that objections to the imposition of your religion by law are somehow efforts to establish another religion. The lack of your religion is not a religion. Atheism is a religion in the same way that baldness is a hair color. Personally, I could give a rats tootie about establishing any religion. I like the Constitution just the way it is. You are free to practice your religion in any way you want in your home, your church, and even on the streets. As long as you don't obstruct traffic, you are free to stand on street corners and wave your book of mythology over your head and shout at passers by, just as so many of your fellow christians do. I laugh at those almost as much as I laugh at your rants on this board.\n \nOnly in your twisted mind can our rejection of your sides attempts to tear down what made this Country so great be perceived as attempting to impose our will on you.\nAgain, you put no thought into your post. Your religion didn't make this country great. One of the factors that did contribute to the greatness of this country was the exclusion of religion from the national Constitution and the disestablishment of state religions and the replacement of them with guarantees of religious freedom. I base my opinion on having studied the topic extensively. If you are interested in learning about the Revolutionary and Constitutional periods of History, I can recommend about 20 histories of the time that deal with the topic for you. I own about 15 myself.\n \n Attempting to teach your religion as science in schools is an attempt to impose your religion on everyone, even though you don't seem to be able to grasp that.\n \nYour side has fought to take prayer and pledging the flag out of schools even though no child was ever forced to participate in either.\nWrong. There was lots of forcing. By the way, the first case that decided that students could not be forced to recite the Pledge was brought by a christian family. Their particular cult forbade such demonstrations. Even after that, students have still been forced to recite the pledge. To claim otherwise is an admission of ignorance.\n \n And somehow you don't see the recitation of prayers of your religion as forcing your religion on students of other faiths? Of course, you wouldn't object to equal time for Muslims, Buddhists, Shintoists, Wiccans and various christian cults (including your own). And how about equal time for atheists to stand and declare what utter nonsense it is to worship magical beings while everyone bows their heads and then answers \"amen\"?\n \nYou have fought to ban nativity scenes from State houses during Christmas holidays even though Christmas is historically a celebration of Christ's birth.\nAnd that isn't a religious celebration? So your are saying that Chirst was a fake? He wasn't a religious figure? And yes, such displays shouldn't be in the state houses or the courts. If you want to put such silly things in front of your church, feel free. That's what the 1st Amendment says. Worship as you will but you can't use the government to do so.\n \nYou have sought to take the teaching of Creationism out of schools in favor of evolution even though by your own claims evolution isn't about the origin of Man, but only about the evolution of life.\nYet more ranting without thought. Yes, I agree that creationism should not be imposed on students in public schools because it is religion. The school is a department of government and as such is forbidden by the 1st and 14th Amendments from any acts that would support or endorse religion, not to mention that Pledges, prayers, and creationism interferes with the free practice of my religion.\n \nOf course the examples of the radical Lefts attempts to redefine our culture in their warped image could go on for pages, but my point is made.\nAnd that wasn't warped? I have no doubt that you could go on with your thoughtless and uneducated rant for pages. I suspect that, even though it started out on a low level, it would go down hill from here.\n \nYour side is dedicating to erasing any and all references to the Judeo Christian ethic from the American psyche and then you have the nerve to say that we are attempting to impose our wills on you by resisting your attempts to wipe the culture and traditions we represent off of the face of the Earth?\nHoly Christ on a crutch! What pucky! I don't care about references to the Judeo-Christian ethic except when they are imposed by my government. Like I said, stand on the corner screaming about your magic man while waving your Bible over your head. I don't care. Do what you want on your own time, in your own home or church. Just don't use my government to impose your religion on others.\n \nHow incredibly disingenuous of you. Here are my 2 posts in question. I ask any objective observer to judge them as ridiculous rants in comparison to the very corrupted and inaccurate rewrite of the historical facts in reality which pandion is spewing above.\nPlease, everyone read his posts and offer an opinion of who is ranting.\n \n The offer of book recommendations so that you might actually educate yourself about the traditions of religious freedom in our country still stands. But I suspect you aren't interested in learning.",

Should we teach them the childish myth about how the earth is only 6000 years old? That story is based on the mythology of some bronze age nomadic herdsmen.

But you can't teach it to my children as science.\n \nNothing about the 'Millions of years ago', doctrine can be proven, observed or demonstrated to be a likely history. It can only be believed in.

Secular humanism isn't taught, as far as I know. Except maybe in a course on comparative religion, which is the only place where your religion should be taught in a public school.

Would you prefer that we offer magic as an explanation?\n \nAdditionally, I just heard again of a fellow's 18 yr old granddaughter telling him that babies in the womb have gills.\nNow you're not telling the truth. You didn't just hear that. You read that on some silly creationist site. They duped you again. Why would this girl tell him that. Either she doesn't understand what she is talking about or he doesn't. It's just plain silly.\n \nReally!?!!? Gills!?!!? Biology has really moved forward since Haeckel's time\nNo. Not gills. Only fools who haven't been paying attention make such claims. Mammal embryos never have gills. The do have what are called \"gill slits\". But they really should be called gill folds or gill arches. All vertebrates develop these gill arches that develop into gills in fish and parts of the jaw, ears and circulatory system in higher animals. Go and learn something.\n \nIt is for the sole purpose of promoting the religion of Death.\nIt this hysterical screaming necessary? Science isn't religion. That's why science is taught in science classes while your superstitious version of religion is not.\n \nAbortion is just fine if we are a random collection of dna molecules.\nAnother non-sequitur.

   "Nope. I'm saying that we wouldn't understand why clindamycin works on anything other than bacteria, like most other antibiotics. Because as it happens, clindamycin can be used on some eukaryotic parasites, namely Toxoplasma, the cause of toxoplasmosis, and Plasmodium, the cause of malaria. And it works without destroying host cells or their mitochondria. This is because it turns out that Toxoplasma and Plasmodium contain organelles that were once chloroplasts, as can be shown by these organelles' DNA.\n \n When Intelligent Design (or any other form of creationism) comes up with an explanation for how chloroplasts wind up in a non-photosynthetic organism at all, or for why the DNA of these organelles so closely resembles that of chloroplasts if there is no relationship between them, then I will fall to my knees and sing the glories of ID. But my hunch is that all ID can say on the matter is, \"It is so, thanks to the inscrutable intentions of the creator.\" Which may be true, I suppose, but which cannot reasonably called an \"explanation\" of anything. \n\n \n You make a very good case in this particular application. Evolution couldn't attain the heights it has in science and philosophy without a few cases like this. \n \n \nNot very good. The Discovery Institute article is dead wrong. Even sticking to the example I've given above, evolution has lead to hypotheses about what other sorts of non-bacterial illnesses clindamycin and other similar antibiotics can treat, as well as suggesting hypotheses about how to improve the treatment of the non-bacterial illnesses we already know it can. The generation of further hypotheses is hardly what I would call mere \"narrative gloss.\"\n \n Meanwhile, so what if some research projects don't have direct evolutionary input? The double helical structure of DNA, for example, doesn't require evolution in order to be discovered and observed. But what about explaining it? No one ever said that evolution was going to be directly relevant to every aspect of every project. This hardly changes the fact that it is directly relevant to many aspects of many projects, and secondarily relevant to many more. So the author's point is really quite pointless. \n\n \n The question is, how do we keep individual scientists opinions from claiming a direct relevance to evolution even when there may not be? The answer is, we can't and we aren't, hence all the logical proof that atheism is taking over science. Now I know that claim inspires me to be mocked - the opening post of this thread strongly hinted of mocking. It usually does, when the word \"conspiracy\" is used. I've addressed it before;\n \n \nOriginally posted by marc9000 You've used the word \"conspiracy\" many times throughout this debate. In recent times, it's a word that has actually become pretty useless, unless it's used for mocking purposes. Several years ago, Hillary Clinton attempted to use it properly in her \"vast right wing conspiracy\" comment, and all it did was get her mocked. I'm sure she regretted using it. It's such a popular word for mocking that atheists have included it in one of their favorite 3 letter designations, \"E.A.C.\" For \"evil atheist conspiracy\". It doesn't matter if it's creationist vs. evolutionist, Christian vs. atheist, conservative vs. liberal or Republican vs. Democrat, if any of them call into question the general flow of societal events that may result from the \"progress\" - the \"modernism\" that's advocated from the evolutionist, the atheist, the liberal, or the Democrat, then they are mocked by implication that they fear an evil atheist conspiracy that is far too ridiculous to actually exist. When prayer was outlawed in public schools in the 1960's, many Christians were wondering what was going to be next - a removal of the Ten Commandments from the public square maybe, or an outlawing of nativity scenes at Christmas, a removal of the words \"under God\" from our pledge of allegiance? They're then mocked about the \"evil atheist conspiracy\", when in fact the GENERAL SOCIETAL FLOW OF EVENTS that they actually feared really do take place more often than not. It may not have been a conspiracy, but it happened, to the delight of the perpetrators of the original restriction. It's similar to the early 70's smoking restriction on \"airline flights of 2 hours or less\". There was probably no conspiracy to outlaw smoking in entire cities 30 years later, or ticket truck drivers for \"smoking in the workplace\". But it was a natural flow of events. The slippery slope is very real. \n\n \n \nAnd his comments about the irrelevance of Darwinian natural selection to antibiotic and pesticide resistance studies is... well, I mean, wow. One wonders who exactly were the \"biologists\" he \"queried\" about this. Citations of literature would be nice; I will leave it to you to decide what it means that he offered none. \n\n \n It's easy for me to decide what it means when you say it's \"dead wrong\". It shows me that evolution, even science, is a subject that is every bit as subjective and opinionated as economics. \n \n \nAnd how does the book show any connection between the explanations of evolutionary biology and the particular prescriptions for or against any particular answer to those value questions? The excerpt on Amazon offered no such connection. \n\n \n Sure it did - they were basic, but they were there. From one Amazon review;\n \n \nShe's taken the time to review hundreds of biology textbooks from the 1960s to the present, showing their subtle racist and anti-religious messages. \n\n \n She gave the history of the BSCS (Biological sciences curriculum study) - the political reasons for its origination. At that time (1958) biology was at a low priority in funding. The uneasiness about a possible neuclear confrontation with Russia had the hard sciences in the limelight. \"So in 1958, a group of leading biologists formed the BSCS to promote the teaching of biology designed to educate a large number of students - who are potential voting citizens.\" \n \n and\n \n \nShe also does a great job exposing California's Proposition 71, which raised billions for stem cell research. Unbelievable scientific fraud and Hollywood pretension. \n\n \n Christopher Reeve, Michael J. Fox, Dustin Hoffman, Brad Pitt - campaigning for billions while California's economy is an absolute train wreck. Evolutionary biology had plenty of connection with values. California has a lot more crumbling freeways and schools because of these particular Hollywood values. Like the scientific community, the Hollywood community has a distinct difference in values with that of the general public, even in California. \n \n Evolution/science claims to be so beneficial to life in the US - we have thousands of new prescription and OTC drugs that were unheard of only a few decades ago, it's a multi billion dollar industry. Are people in the US all that much more healthy and happy than they were a few decades ago because of these drugs? We havent' built a new oil refinery in the US in 33 years - could the US possibly be better off with a few more oil refineries and a few less drugs? Would our national debt be just a little lower? As science takes credit for it's accomplishments, shouldn't it also take blame for its waste? \n \n \n \nI've been reading Michael Ruse's Darwinism and Its Discontents. In the opening to one chapter, he points out that Darwinism has been criticized by opposite sides for precisely opposed moral reasons. He cites an excellent pair: Phillip Johnson is a conservative and a Christian; he opposes Darwinism because he thinks it subverts traditional values. Richard Lewontin is a Marxist and an atheist; he opposes Darwinism because he thinks it supports traditional values.\n\n \n Michael Ruse is one of the few atheists who analyzes the creation/evolution controversy while usually trying not to let his own personal views taint his observations. But I guess my respect for him just went down a notch - Richard Lewontin is an evolutionist!! How can he say he opposes Darwinism? It seems that atheists try to divide and separate all the various Darwinist philosophers who have used any form of godlessness to support a societal ideology. While there are differences in them, they all have one thing in common - they disregard religion, particularly the Judeo-Christian religion that inspired western governments. \n \n \nWhich is just to show that, trying to draw a straight line between Darwinian evolution and particular answers to particular questions of value simply can't be done. Which is really no surprise: in philosophy, we call this the \"Is-Ought\" distinction. Maybe you should read up on that. \n\n \n I already have. It got my attention back when Richard Dawkins used it, in his rant against the movie expelled. I've had this link bookmarked for a few weeks now. It looks to me like the \"is-ought\" thing is a close cousin of the slippery slope fallacy. There are two opinions of the slippery slope fallacy, and I gave mine in my copy/paste above, where I said the slippery slope is very real. Is-ought references may claim a distinction between what is and what ought to be, but \"societal flows of events\" tend to blend them in the real world. \n \n \nMeanwhile, the \"secular neutrality is a myth\" article had nary a thing to say on using evolution to justify ethical positions, which makes it totally irrelevant to the point at issue here. It was, however, another ironic example of conservative Christianity's slide into self-undermining relativism. \"All bioethics are biased?\" Well, okay. How exactly does that help her own case about what bioethics ought to be? For she, too, must be biased! \n\n \n It's relevant, because it shows that if it is mostly all subjective, that more than one subjective opinion should be permitted in the public square for balance. It's the spirit of the first amendment. \n \n \nHow is that relevant? Public universities teach evolution. By no means does this conflict with all religious views. And for those whose religious views are offended, they are not required to accept anything about evolution.\n\n \n It's my view that evolution isn't objective enough to be established, without alternatives, in public education. It's a broad subject, and the definition of exactly what it is can change according to who is applying it and how they are applying it. I thoroughly explained my beliefs here, though that was before the movie \"Expelled\". It supported much of what I said - I could probably do a better job of making a case for it now. \n \n \nThe idea is that if students are going to take a biology class, then they have to come away with an understanding of biology. Part of what that means is, they will have to study evolution, and they will be graded on how well they understand it. If they are so inclined, they may choose to reject what biology says about evolution for non-biological reasons, e.g. because they believe a literal interpretation of Genesis is true. But at least now they'll understand what they're rejecting. And of course, just because they understand the biological idea they reject, that doesn't mean that their rejection is itself a biological idea.\n \n If you can show me how any of that violates the 1st Amendment's Establishment Clause, by all means do so.\n \n \n \n I'm afraid all Behe can show is that evolution doesn't produce extremely complex features in a single step. But nobody ever disputed that. And he certainly didn't show that in order to produce extremely complex features via very many steps over a long period of time, one must invoke intelligence.\n \n \n \n Which is a self-undermining tactic: Since your opponents cannot be neutral, why should they try? Since you cannot be neutral, why should anyone think you're any less biased than they are? Heck, if bias is unavoidable, why even think it's bad? \n\n \n Why indeed should they try, if they've established their non-neutrality in public schools in violation of the first amendment. They're in the drivers seat. What the social costs are depends on the worldview of the person analyzing it. \n \n \nSure I would. But it's precisely to avoid this kind of bias that peer review is done blind. Reviewers don't know whose work they're reviewing, so they can't let their pre-judgements about an author influence their assessments of the merits of his work. \n\n \n Maybe not their pre-judgements about an author, just their pre-judgements of their beloved idol, Darwin. \n \n \nRegarding Herbert Spence, I had written:\n \n \n \n You then cite the Wikipedia entry on Spencer:\n \n \n \n And then you ask:\n \n \n \n I'm afraid that you are. Spencer's own position has nothing to do with how evolutionary biology works. He developed it prior to the publication of Darwin's Origin (1859), beginning with Social Statics (1851) and maturing by the publication of \"Progress: Its Law and Cause\" (1857).\n \n And as is noted in the remainder of the very Wikipedia article you cite:\n \n Spencer's version of evolution is not even Darwin's, let alone the refined Darwinian version employed in contermporary biology. So as I said, I think you're mischaracterizing history. No emoticon_confused necessary.\n\n \n emoticon_confused\n \n I brough up Spencer as just one example of many - others were Auguste Comte, James Frazer, Edward Tyler, Thomas Huxley, many others - who used what they believed to be a scientific backing to re-evaluate traditional religious doctrine in how societies and individuals should behaviorally function. Most of Spencer's work was done after Darwin. Most all of his and everyone similar to him, from Darwin's time to today, had theories that did vary, but they all used evolutionary concepts related to the gradual rise of man from some ape-like ancestor. When you said;\n \n \nIt is a mischaracterization of history to claim that Spencer's ideas have anything to do with the \"implications\" of evolution at all. \n\n \n It's not my opinion that you are wrong. It's a fact that you are wrong. :) We could do a judged, formal debate on it if you'd like.",

   "Yes. Your posts are typically quite ridiculous and most usually just rants with lots of meaningless quotes from your book of mythology.\n\n \n Meaningless to you pandion; since you don't have the spiritual insight to recognize the truth from the actual man made mythologies which guide your perverted world view.\n \n And why isn't brother Matthew jumping in here to defend the bible against being referred to as meaningless mythology?\n \n \nThere have been efforts by creationists to impose their religion into religion classes my whole life. \n\n \n That's another lie. We have attempted to keep your side from excluding us where we were historically present.\n \n \nFirst there were efforts to exclude the teaching of biology from biology classes and to replace it with religious magic. \n\n \n Again you lie. They were attempting to keep your side from teaching a theory as if it was a fact.\n \n \nThen there were efforts for \"equal time\" for the idiocy of \"creation science.\" \n\n \n The only XXXXXX are those who so fear creationism you will make every effort to erase it from any and all curriculums.\n \n \nMore recently, there were the efforts by the Kansas State Board of Education to remove evolution from the curriculum (yet again) and thereby reduce biology to a series of unrelated observations to memorize. And of course, there was the Dover, PA school board that tried to force their religion into biology classes. Most of these have been decided by court cases, wasting public money on court cases the could have been decided with just a little thought in the first place. In all cases, the religion of creationism has been prohibited from science classes. Idiocy does not merit equal time with science.\n\n \n Show me science and I'll embrace it. But your man made fairy tale of evo is the ultimate joke on a dumbed down america, and it only took 40 years to accomplish the secular humanist agenda.\n \n \nBut I didn't say that. I said that creationists are trying to force their religion on everyone. As mentioned above, in the schools. Chief Justice Moore of the Alabama Supreme court placed a huge erection that memorialized religion in the court building. And there have been efforts to establish a national religion. In fact, at the time that the Constitution was written, most states had established, official state religions. We've been listening to so called christians whining about a christian nation ever since.\n\n \n Of course in your twisted rationale a STATES judge placing the 10 commandments on the court house steps is equivalent to passing a state sponsored bill forcing all americans to become christians. Do you see why you have no credibility as a rational thinker? But like a typical extremist, you must take one innocent example and attempt to apply it to the whole group? \n \n On the other hand, the agenda of the left to erase any mention or recognition of God or a spiritual perspective is being erased on a National scale in every aspect of our Society. From the Federal to the State to the public schools.\n \n \nAgain you post without thought. It's pretty silly to claim that objections to the imposition of your religion by law are somehow efforts to establish another religion. The lack of your religion is not a religion. Atheism is a religion in the same way that baldness is a hair color. Personally, I could give a rats tootie about establishing any religion. I like the Constitution just the way it is. You are free to practice your religion in any way you want in your home, your church, and even on the streets. As long as you don't obstruct traffic, you are free to stand on street corners and wave your book of mythology over your head and shout at passers by, just as so many of your fellow christians do. I laugh at those almost as much as I laugh at your rants on this board.\n\n \n Speaking of rants; what do you call this irrational tirade? And I have already shown that the Court of appeals has declared atheism a religion. A post you never responded to, I might add.\n \n \nAgain, you put no thought into your post. Your religion didn't make this country great. One of the factors that did contribute to the greatness of this country was the exclusion of religion from the national Constitution and the disestablishment of state religions and the replacement of them with guarantees of religious freedom. I base my opinion on having studied the topic extensively. If you are interested in learning about the Revolutionary and Constitutional periods of History, I can recommend about 20 histories of the time that deal with the topic for you. I own about 15 myself.\n\n \n Your ignorance and denial of the fact that the moral foundation this Country was built upon, lies directly in the Judeo-Christian ethic is understandable given your anathema to christianity. But that ignorance in no way proves your point.\n \n \nAttempting to teach your religion as science in schools is an attempt to impose your religion on everyone, even though you don't seem to be able to grasp that.\n\n \n No it isn't. It's our attempt to preserve the other side of the debate by keeping the spiritual perspective alive in the minds of our youth so they will be free to question our origins other than through the scientific method referred to as evolution which we believe is false and misleading. As much as that disturbs you, if you really endorsed free though, you wouldn't be threatened by that.\n \n \nWrong. There was lots of forcing. By the way, the first case that decided that students could not be forced to recite the Pledge was brought by a christian family. Their particular cult forbade such demonstrations. Even after that, students have still been forced to recite the pledge. To claim otherwise is an admission of ignorance.\n\n \n Even when I was in grammar school in the 60s, I had fellow students who's religions prevented them from either praying or pledging allegiance to the flag, and they were never forced to do it. Once again you remember some isolated event and attempt to condemn the whole because of the few. That is how every extremist must win an argument. By excoriating the larger group because of individual abuses.\n \n \nAnd somehow you don't see the recitation of prayers of your religion as forcing your religion on students of other faiths? Of course, you wouldn't object to equal time for Muslims, Buddhists, Shintoists, Wiccans and various christian cults (including your own). And how about equal time for atheists to stand and declare what utter nonsense it is to worship magical beings while everyone bows their heads and then answers \"amen\"?\n\n \n Either your ignorance or your denial is just mind boggling pandion. Or maybe you're just too young to know the facts. But when we prayed in school, it was called \"silent meditation\" it wasn't a christian prayer at all. I, as a moslem was allegedly praying to allah, as every student prayed to their own God. And atheists could open a book and read if they didn't believe in God. There was no coercion or guilt applied to any aspect of this 30 seconds out of our day. \n \n \nAnd that isn't a religious celebration? So your are saying that Chirst was a fake? He wasn't a religious figure? And yes, such displays shouldn't be in the state houses or the courts. If you want to put such silly things in front of your church, feel free. That's what the 1st Amendment says. Worship as you will but you can't use the government to do so.\n\n \n No it isn't a religious celebration at all. It's a public recognition that Christmas is about the birth of Christ rather than a commercialized secular money making event. How terrible it must be for atheists to allow some americans to remember the actual reason for the season in contrast the the commercialized business which Christmas has become. How does a Nativity scene offend someone who believes it's all mythology anyway? I'll bet a dollar to a dime you wouldn't be offended if someone put up a statue of Zeus, yet the baby Jesus in a manger sends you running for the hills in protest.\n \n \nYet more ranting without thought. Yes, I agree that creationism should not be imposed on students in public schools because it is religion. The school is a department of government and as such is forbidden by the 1st and 14th Amendments from any acts that would support or endorse religion, not to mention that Pledges, prayers, and creationism interferes with the free practice of my religion.\n\n \n If these practices were ever endorsements of one religion, they never would have been allowed in the first place. So your distortion of what they represent has been refuted as I showed above. Continuing to repeat it just exposes your paranoia.",

   "In the interests of time, I'm going to trim this response down a bit. I hope that won't seem too much of a cop-out! But I think some interesting issues can be focused well enough that there won't be much lost.\n \n I.\n \n \nYou make a very good case in this particular application. Evolution couldn't attain the heights it has in science and philosophy without a few cases like this.\n\n \n Thanks!\n \n And indeed it couldn't. The thing is, these sorts of cases are not so \"few\" as you might think!\n \n II.\n \n \nThe question is, how do we keep individual scientists opinions from claiming a direct relevance to evolution even when there may not be? The answer is, we can't and we aren't, hence all the logical proof that atheism is taking over science. Now I know that claim inspires me to be mocked - the opening post of this thread strongly hinted of mocking. It usually does, when the word \"conspiracy\" is used.\n\n \n Well, first off, let me say that it was not my intention to mock you! I can certainly be blunt and combative, and sometimes I will tease. But I have no desire to mock you. I am sorry for coming off that way.\n \n But I should also say that I don't set much store by the idea that atheism is taking over science. One doesn't have to be an atheist to be a good scientist or get one's work accepted by the scientific community. It's just that one doesn't have to be a theist for these things, either.\n \n Which is as it should be. We all live in the same empirically observable natural world. It shouldn't matter whether one is Catholic or Protestant, Jewish or Muslim, Hindu or Buddhist, atheist or agnostic: the science is the same for all of us.\n \n As for the specifics of the explanation you cited, I guess I think it takes more than a \"flow of events\" for a \"conspiracy.\" Industrialization involved a \"flow of events,\" and not everyone was happy about them. But it wasn't a \"conspiracy.\" (And even Marx didn't think so!) What we need are an identifiable set of real, particular conspirators who intend to control, and who do in fact control, the scientific community in order to bring about a desired end. And that's what we don't have yet.\n \n III.\n \n \nSure it did - they were basic, but they were there. From one Amazon review...\n\n \n With this, we're into the book you had recommended. If you need to go back and look at your post again (or mine), or if you need to go to Amazon to look at the review you cited or the excerpt from the book, then take a sec and do so. But I think it's pretty clear when one looks at all of this: there is no specific connection being drawn between evolution and these moral problems. Sure, such a connection is claimed. But where's the evidence?\n \n Perhaps it's out there, I'm not going to rule out the possibility. But the arguments so far provided don't connect evolution to these problems. For good measure, look at the following paragraph of yours:\n \n \nChristopher Reeve, Michael J. Fox, Dustin Hoffman, Brad Pitt - campaigning for billions while California's economy is an absolute train wreck. Evolutionary biology had plenty of connection with values. California has a lot more crumbling freeways and schools because of these particular Hollywood values. Like the scientific community, the Hollywood community has a distinct difference in values with that of the general public, even in California.\n\n \n Fair enough. But what does evolutionary biology have to do with all these things? You can't just drop in a sentence saying that it's connected with value among comments about hypocritical actors and California crumbling and have done with it!\n \n Or the following:\n \n \nEvolution/science claims to be so beneficial to life in the US - we have thousands of new prescription and OTC drugs that were unheard of only a few decades ago, it's a multi billion dollar industry. Are people in the US all that much more healthy and happy than they were a few decades ago because of these drugs?...\n\n \n Probably not! But how would that imply anything about whether evolution is good science? You continue:\n \n \nWe havent' built a new oil refinery in the US in 33 years - could the US possibly be better off with a few more oil refineries and a few less drugs? Would our national debt be just a little lower?\n\n \n Quite possibly! But what does it have to do with evolution?\n \n As I said at the outset, I think you're running a lot of ideas together here, without making a careful analysis. When it comes to issues of morality and policy, neither evolution in particular nor science in general can't tell us what we oughtto do. They can tell us how things work, and that's it.\n \n Science could tell you what the effects of abortion are, but it doesn't say when you \"should\" have one -- if ever. Science can explain what happens when you drill for oil, but it doesn't tell you whether you \"ought\" to drill or not. This is what I meant in invoking the is-ought to distinction.\n \n III.A.\n \n \nMichael Ruse is one of the few atheists who analyzes the creation/evolution controversy while usually trying not to let his own personal views taint his observations. But I guess my respect for him just went down a notch - Richard Lewontin is an evolutionist!! How can he say he opposes Darwinism?\n\n \n Because Lewontin has always thought that adaptation and natural selection are overestimated, and he has nothing but scorn for applying Darwinism to human beings.\n \n My point is simply that you can't go from Darwinian evolution to values. Some conservatives think it gives you a leftist nightmare. Some liberals think it gives you a right-wing nightmare. Obviously, they can't both be right, at least not in any general sense. The reality is always more complicated than that.\n \n IV.\n \n \nI brough up Spencer as just one example of many - others were Auguste Comte, James Frazer, Edward Tyler, Thomas Huxley, many others - who used what they believed to be a scientific backing to re-evaluate traditional religious doctrine in how societies and individuals should behaviorally function.[boldface added by Matthew]\n\n \n True enough, and I don't mean to deny it! But the question is, is the scientific backing they believed they possessed really something they had? I think in the case of Spencer, the answer is no. He didn't even care for natural selection, because he recognized -- as did Darwin -- that it doesn't necessitate absolute progress, only relative progress. Despite coining the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" for Darwin, Spencer's view of evolution was progressivist and Lamarckian to the core. So I don't think it is at all accurate to treat Darwin's work as if it grounds or implies Spencer's. Needless to say, this applies a fortiori to contemporary evolutionary biology.\n \n Ruse has done some interesting work on this, separating out the metaphysical and value-laden philosophies of evolution (including that held by Darwin himself) from the empirical and value-neutral science of evolution (derived from Darwin's scientific work and refined for over a century now).\n \n \nMost [Spencer-types] from Darwin's time to today, had theories that did vary, but they all used evolutionary concepts related to the gradual rise of man from some ape-like ancestor.\n\n \n Sure! But how does that show that there's some intrinsic, logical connection between evolution and Spencer's laissez-faire capitalism or other social theories?\n \n It simply doesn't, which is exactly why Wallace could be a socialist and Gould could be a Marxist.\n \n (I hasten to add that it would be just as gross a mistake to think that evolution justifies socialism, too.)",

Where as the natural man picks and chooses what he will hold to as acceptable based on his personal preferences and opinion of right and wrong. That is what you are guilty of as I see it. \n \n You have no dedicated commitment to the Lord or what He represents or you couldn't just ignore the attacks He receives by unbelievers and atheists around here and just brush it off self righteously as it isn't your responsibility to defend Him. After all, He isn't on this forum to defend Himself, but you're here. And if you truly knew Him personally and loved Him as I do, you would be committed to standing up for Him and defending Him against people who call Him and His word mythical rants of bronze age goat herders. \n \n You couldn't stand by and allow that because you would realize that not only is it an attack on His truths, but it's an insult to your intelligence based on your belief in His word. So if that open attack on God doesn't offend you, it's because it doesn't apply to you as one of the Lords followers. Which explains why you prefer not disagreeing with pandion by defending Christ.

   "Your short posting demonstrates how completely ignorant you are of the most elementary aspects of Science!\n \n First, the verb \"believe\" is not within the lexicon of science. Science asks us to \"believe\" nothing.\n \n The present available evidence shows a remarkable unity in indicating that a \"Big Bang\" of some sort lies at the beginning of the observable universe. However, there is an army of extremely gifted thinkers who have explored every alternative hypothesis of which they are able to conceive, in order to explain the observable facts. That so little success has attended their efforts is, in itself, impressive.\n \n It is impossible that Science asks us to believe that the universe is as it is by luck, since there is is no generally agreed-upon definition of the word \"luck.\" A fortiori, there are no hypothetical mechanisms which would make sense of such a conception. (But see the astounding revelations below, especially postings #5, #6, and #9):\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/worldviews/12148-extraterrestrials-greetings-earthlings-1-a.html\n \n Perhaps your mental processes might approach some coherent form if you did some research on the concepts: \"chance,\" or \"statistical paradigms.\"\n \n And don't forget quantum mechanics. Probability takes on quite a counter-intuitive form when probability values range over the complex plane, rather than merely over the positive real numbers. \n \n -\n\n \n The 'genius' sidesteps the point by giving an English grammar lesson.\n Maybe he is poring his verbal Diaorrhea over the point so as to make it disappear...an intellectual giant, I think not!",

   "You would be very wrong Matthew, in your assumption.\n\n \n Quite possibly! But how would you convince me? All you've done in this post is repeat the problem, not dispel it.\n \n \nEspecially since a believers interpretation of the bible isn't based on His personal experiences, but on the truth of Gods word independent of any and all human experiences.\n\n \n And my contention is that, insofar as the \"believers\" in question are one and all human, it is absolutely, unconditionally, completely, totally, entirely, and 100% IMPOSSIBLE for their interpretations of the Bible to be independent of human experiences.\n \n Being \"born again\" does not mean no longer being human, and subject to all the limitations thereof. If you think otherwise, that is what I am challenging you to defend.\n \n \n... That doesn't change the fact that I interpret His word according to His Holy Spirit and you interpret it based on your fleshly understanding.\n\n \n And my point is, you can say your interpretation has no connection to the flesh all you want. Your interpretation nonetheless does remain connected to it. (Unless you can give me some reason to think otherwise, of course.)\n \n This doesn't mean that you aren't also inspired and guided by the Spirit. It just means that you can't claim to have transcended your human limitations just because the topic happens to be your religious beliefs.\n \n \n...the natural man picks and chooses what he will hold to as acceptable based on his personal preferences and opinion of right and wrong.\n\n \n You mean, like, arbitrarily deciding that the word \"Lord\" must be understood to refer to Jesus?... But I digress.\n \n \nYou have no dedicated commitment to the Lord or what He represents or you couldn't just ignore the attacks He receives by unbelievers and atheists around here and just brush it off self righteously as it isn't your responsibility to defend Him.\n\n \n You are free to think so.\n \n I just happen to think that many professed atheists have most definitely come to the Father through Christ, even if they don't realize it. I also happen to think that many professed Christians don't seem to know Him at all, despite what they may think. By their deeds are they known, in both cases.\n \n So atheism simply doesn't bother me.\n \n \nAfter all, He isn't on this forum to defend Himself, but you're here.\n\n \n The idea that God would ever need to be \"defended\" from anything that human beings could possibly do is, as I have already pointed out more than once -- and as Subaru also lampooned in his \"blasphemies\" -- absurd.

So if that open attack on God doesn't offend you, it's because it doesn't apply to you as one of the Lords followers.\n\n \n How, exactly, is it an \"insult\" to me at all?\n \n I think, Archie, that you need to stop taking all this so personally.",

It isn't my job to convince you of it nor is it within my power to. Only by way of the Holy Spirit can you discern spiritual truths. You're no better off than subaru as you ask for evidence which if you truly knew the truth, you would understands only comes through Christ by way of His indwelling Holy Spirit within each believer. And you have more in common with him than me also since you obviously relate to him more than my spiritual perspective.\n \n This isn't a group effort but an individual journey for each of us. BUT, and it's a huge BUT, because God is consistent in His dealings with us, all true believers have Him in common. But you and I have nothing in common. We are night and day regarding our spiritual compatibility goes.\n \n \nAnd my contention is that, insofar as the \"believers\" in question are one and all human, it is absolutely, unconditionally, completely, totally, entirely, and 100% IMPOSSIBLE for their interpretations of the Bible to be independent of human experiences.\n\n \n And you would be absolutely, unconditionally, completely, totally, entirely, and 100% WRONG!!!\n \n \nBeing \"born again\" does not mean no longer being human, and subject to all the limitations thereof.\n\n \n True, and I never said otherwise. \n \n \n If you think otherwise, that is what I am challenging you to defend.\n\n \n Here's my point Matt, since I can't respond to all of your confused interpretations of what I say. The point is that if we were on the same spiritual plane at all, then this conversation wouldn't be necessary.\n \n \nAnd my point is, you can say your interpretation has no connection to the flesh all you want. Your interpretation nonetheless does remain connected to it. (Unless you can give me some reason to think otherwise, of course.)\n\n \n How can I make it clear to you Matt? When I explain it in my words, you misinterpret what I'm saying because it's beyond you to grasp. And when I post the scriptures that explain your spiritual need you ignore them and demand evidence. If you knew the truth within you, the scriptures I posted would be evidence to you. The very fact that the word of God goes right over your head is the evidence that you have a serious spiritual need. And you can't even see it.\n \n \nYou mean, like, arbitrarily deciding that the word \"Lord\" must be understood to refer to Jesus?... But I digress.\n\n \n Sure, that's an excellent example. Also the fact that you see no reason to speak up for the Lord against the numerous attacks against Him around here. \n \n \nI just happen to think that many professed atheists have most definitely come to the Father through Christ, even if they don't realize it. I also happen to think that many professed Christians don't seem to know Him at all, despite what they may think. By their deeds are they known, in both cases.\n \n So atheism simply doesn't bother me.\n\n \n Now look in the mirror when you say that and we'll finally be communicating here. And would you care to show me where the bible say's that those who deny Him will be saved? It's exactly statements like that which fly in the face of biblical truths but sound just fine to your mind.\n \n \nThe idea that God would ever need to be \"defended\" from anything that human beings could possibly do is, as I have already pointed out more than once -- and as Subaru also lampooned in his \"blasphemies\" -- absurd. I prefer defending people, who, quite unlike God, can actually be harmed.\n\n \n Do you see the bolded word Matt? Do you see how dishonest your response is based on that 2 letter word? I was talking about defending the Lord against what people say and you respond with God doesn't need defense against what people do. A completely fallacious point compared to what I was saying, yet I'm sure it sounded like a reasonable response to you in the moment. emoticon_xdonno\n \n \nIndeed, it might even be the case that, when I defend even the least of them, I defend Him after all. And that apologetics is just a devil's sideshow in the service of the aforementioned absurdity.\n\n \n Listen here my self righteous friend. You like to sound religious, you just have no idea how to be righteous. These are atheists who hate God and christians. They are not the least of us, they are the most militant and hateful among us. And if you understood that the word of God never comes back void, so sharing it truthfully rather than compromising Gods truths by agreeing with, or making sure you don't challenge them is just abandoning the truths you claim to know and embrace. But again, you are blind to these scriptural truths which should be obvious to you if you knew the truth.\n \n \nThe fact that I don't love Him \"as you do\" doesn't mean that I don't love Him.\n \n Why is that so difficult for you to accept?\n\n \n Let me be blunt Matt. If you loved Him, you couldn't ignore an atheist making a libelous statement about him which you knew to be untrue for 2 reasons; one, because you would need to defend the truth about your Lord who died for your personal sins, and 2, because your love for the atheist would be so great that you need to correct their error in how they are misjudging God. By just walking by and not caring, you are no better than a Pharisee who would walk past a bleeding man on the road on the Sabbath. \n \n \nHow, exactly, is it an \"insult\" to me at all?\n\n \n I've explained it too many times to repeat myself again.\n \n \nI think, Archie, that you need to stop taking all this so personally.\n\n \n I take attacks on my Heavenly Father personally Matt. But maybe that's just because I actually love Him and have personally experienced His unconditional love for me when He took my sins upon Himself. But again, the personal value of what I'm saying just goes right over your head as you write back asking me to prove it. emoticon_xdonno",

But why is it that, if I \"don't get\" where you're coming from, it's because I \"refuse\" to get it?\n \n Why must you always -- and I mean always, without fail -- address people's disagreements with you in terms of incorrect exerise of will rather than incorrect exercise of intellect? Is it possible for someone to honestly disagree with you about religious matters? Or is such disageement ipso facto indicative of character flaws?\n \n \nIt isn't my job to convince you of it nor is it within my power to. Only by way of the Holy Spirit can you discern spiritual truths.\n\n \n Do you understand what I'm asking you to convince me of? I didn't ask you to convince me of those spiritual truths. You made a claim, namely that your participation here represents God's words, not any human beliefs or experiences. I want you to convince me that that claim is true.\n \n I mean, put yourself in our shoes. Isn't the claim you made exactly what a false prophet would say, no less than a true? So by what criterion can we be sure that you're not a false prophet? Is there any reason you can give us?\n \n \n[Me:] And my contention is that, insofar as the \"believers\" in question are one and all human, it is absolutely, unconditionally, completely, totally, entirely, and 100% IMPOSSIBLE for their interpretations of the Bible to be independent of human experiences.\n\n \n \n[You:] And you would be absolutely, unconditionally, completely, totally, entirely, and 100% WRONG!!!\n\n \n Okay. Now explain to me why I'm wrong. Simply saying repeatedly that I'm wrong does not establish the fact, no matter how many capital letters or exclamation points you use.\n \n All I'm asking for is some reasons. I fail to see why that should arouse such shouting.\n \n \n[Me:] Being \"born again\" does not mean no longer being human, and subject to all the limitations thereof.\n\n \n \n[You:] True, and I never said otherwise.\n\n \n Not so, Archie! You just said (\"!!!\") that I am utterly \"WRONG\" to say that it is impossible for human beings to interpret scripture independently of their human expeiences. So in your view, it clearly is possible for believers to escape at least some of their human limitations, albeit (I assume) only through the grace of God.\n \n (And I repeat that I would still like to know by what criterion I would be able to distinguish someone who really has escaped these constraints from someone who merely claims to have escaped them.)\n \n \nHere's my point Matt, since I can't respond to all of your confused interpretations of what I say.\n\n \n Well, all due respect, but it's not me who at one moment says that believers can intepret scripture independently of their human beliefs and experience, but at the next moment denies that human beings can escape their human limitations. If I am confused by your position, I think it has less to do with me than with you.\n \n Here's my point: You're being totally inconsistent. I am asking you to give me a rational explanation -- perhaps a modification of things you've already said, perhaps merely a clarification -- that would dispel this inconsistency.\n \n \nThe point is that if we were on the same spiritual plane at all, then this conversation wouldn't be necessary.\n\n \n Archie, I'm not doing this out of spiritual corruption. I am trying to understand your view -- which, I think we can both agree, I do not. Insofar as, per your own assessment, we are not on the same spiritual plane, would you mind having this conversation? would you mind trying to explain yourself? or are you just going to complain that it shouldn't be necessary?\n \n \nHow can I make it clear to you Matt? When I explain it in my words, you misinterpret what I'm saying because it's beyond you to grasp.\n\n \n Is it possible -- just maybe -- that some of the fault here is yours?\n \n When people say that they don't understand me, I don't say, \"Sorry, it's beyond your ability\" and then repeat exactly what they already said they don't understand. I try to explain myself more effectively.\n \n Why is it so awful of me to ask you to make this sort of attempt?\n \n \nIf you knew the truth within you, the scriptures I posted would be evidence to you. The very fact that the word of God goes right over your head is the evidence that you have a serious spiritual need. And you can't even see it.\n\n \n But Archie, you won't explain anything!!! I keep telling you that I don't get it, and that I'd like clarification. And all you do in return is hurl personal abuse, about how I'm spiritually dead and incapable of understanding you.\n \n There's really no point engaging in a further substantive debates (e.g. over atheism and what to do about it). Not because our perspectives are so different, for that gap could be bridged. No, the problem is that right now, you don't seem interested in bridging it: all I can reasonably expect is that you'll declare any disagreements with you to be character flaws.\n \n And I can think of more spiritually useful (and personally enjoyable) ways to spend my time.",

I am also sure that if there were a god up there and I came to 'know' him (or her) on a personal level then I would also come to 'know' that your ramblings are way way off the mark.\n \n So the question remains, what makes you think that your interpretation of the bible is based solely on 'god's truth' when there are so many other interpretations that are bogus (in your opinion)?\n \n And just for the record, I didn't accuse you of not being able to answer the question, just that you avoid doing so. Presumably because by doing so you would reveal the truth about the BS you spout (note that isn't god's truth, but it is the truth nonetheless).\n \n Smiley",

   "Have I called you names, Archie? Have I questioned your motives? Have I declared that you are on a \"lower plane of understanding\" than me, and that my position is beyond your capacity?\n\n \n Sure you have. On multiple occasions you have attacked my literalist view of interpreting the bible as being motivated by our personal value system. But what you don't and couldn't know is that prior to being saved I was just like everyone else here who's acting in the flesh rather than the spirit. I have been where you're at, but you haven't seen through my eyes or else you would agree with me on spiritual issues which you currently disagree with and debate against ad infinitum.\n \n Just because you're blind to what I see, it doesn't mean that you are any where near being right in what you perceive to be true. You can't even make the connection that when a verse in the New Testament is speaking about the Lord, that it is referring to Jesus Christ, the Messiah. There is no possible way a spirit filled believer could be blind to such an obvious reference to Messiah. \n \n Jesus said:\n Jhn 17:14 I have given them your word and the world has hated them, for they are not of the world any more than I am of the world.\n \n Jhn 17:15 My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one.\n \n Jhn 17:16 They are not of the world, even as I am not of it.\n \n Jhn 17:17 Sanctify [fn] them by the truth; your word is truth.\n By questioning the word of God you are questioning Gods truth Matthew. And you and I are from different worlds which is why you can't relate to where I'm coming from spiritually, just as the Lord is not of this world and you can't relate to Him either. If you could, you would clearly see that the Lord is Jesus.\n \n \n He also said this:\n Mat 10:22 And you will be hated by all for My name's sake. But he who endures to the end will be saved.\n \n Mat 10:23 When they persecute you in this city, flee to another. For assuredly, I say to you, you will not have gone through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.\n \n Mat 10:24 \"A disciple is not above [his] teacher, nor a servant above his master.\n \n Mat 10:25 It is enough for a disciple that he be like his teacher, and a servant like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, [fn] how much more [will they call] those of his household!\n \n Mat 10:26 Therefore do not fear them. For there is nothing covered that will not be revealed, and hidden that will not be known.\n \n See verse 22 Matt? It should haunt you that all of the deniers of God on this forum have no problem at all with your version of Christianity. If you were representing the gospel truth here, they would hate you just as they hate me and the other christians who defend Christ against their lies and perversions of Gods truth. \n \n See verses 23 and 24? You should expect to be persecuted for defending Christ, just as He was persecuted by dying for your sins. But your beliefs don't offend the unbelievers here. They don't have any problem at all with your version of christianity because all you do is claim to be a believer as you deny the power there of. And as I said before; I'm not saying this to attack you but to wake you up to the hypocrisy which you represent by promoting spiritual lies as you insist they are truths. You are doing more harm than good from the perspective of Gods truth being nullified in favor of fleshly doctrines and interpretations.\n \n Verses 25 and 26 are obvious to me.

   "In the interests of time, I'm going to trim this response down a bit. I hope that won't seem too much of a cop-out! But I think some interesting issues can be focused well enough that there won't be much lost.\n \n I.\n\n \n I agree - that's fine. \n \n \nThanks!\n \n And indeed it couldn't. The thing is, these sorts of cases are not so \"few\" as you might think!\n \n II.\n\n \n That may very well be, but there's no guarantee that it's always a good thing, if there are costs involved. One of the things that's always said to me on these forums is that evolution (a belief in a common ancestor for both humans and animals) \"works\". I don't agree that it always works, if it puts the interests of animals above those of humans, or imposes questionable costs. \n \n \nWell, first off, let me say that it was not my intention to mock you! I can certainly be blunt and combative, and sometimes I will tease. But I have no desire to mock you. I am sorry for coming off that way. \n\n \n I wasn't really accusing you of that - my fault for implying it. I was referring to the OP, and many other threads that I've been involved with before this, on this subject. \n \n \nBut I should also say that I don't set much store by the idea that atheism is taking over science. One doesn't have to be an atheist to be a good scientist or get one's work accepted by the scientific community. It's just that one doesn't have to be a theist for these things, either.\n \n Which is as it should be. We all live in the same empirically observable natural world. It shouldn't matter whether one is Catholic or Protestant, Jewish or Muslim, Hindu or Buddhist, atheist or agnostic: the science is the same for all of us.\n \n As for the specifics of the explanation you cited, I guess I think it takes more than a \"flow of events\" for a \"conspiracy.\" Industrialization involved a \"flow of events,\" and not everyone was happy about them. But it wasn't a \"conspiracy.\" (And even Marx didn't think so!) What we need are an identifiable set of real, particular conspirators who intend to control, and who do in fact control, the scientific community in order to bring about a desired end. And that's what we don't have yet. \n\n \n Yet? Do you think it might eventually get here? The movie \"Expelled\", and several books (of both extremes) tell me that it may be closer than we think. Ever hear of \"The God Delusion\" by Dawkins, or Victor Stengers \"The failed hypothesis - how science shows that God does not exist\"? How about this statement;\n \n \nAnything we scientists can do to weaken the hold of religion,\" says Nobel Prize winner Steven Weinberg, \"should be done and may in the end be our greatest contribution to civilization.\n\n \n The Atheists Bible by Joan Konner (Editor) < Books | PopMatters\n \n I'm told that statements like that are just one persons opinion, and don't mean a thing. If his statements don't mean anything, how did he get his Nobel Prize? \n \n \n \n \nIII.\n \n \n \n With this, we're into the book you had recommended. If you need to go back and look at your post again (or mine), or if you need to go to Amazon to look at the review you cited or the excerpt from the book, then take a sec and do so. But I think it's pretty clear when one looks at all of this: there is no specific connection being drawn between evolution and these moral problems. Sure, such a connection is claimed. But where's the evidence?\n \n Perhaps it's out there, I'm not going to rule out the possibility. But the arguments so far provided don't connect evolution to these problems. For good measure, look at the following paragraph of yours:\n \n \n \n Fair enough. But what does evolutionary biology have to do with all these things? You can't just drop in a sentence saying that it's connected with value among comments about hypocritical actors and California crumbling and have done with it!\n \n Or the following:\n \n \n \n Probably not! But how would that imply anything about whether evolution is good science? You continue:\n \n \n \n Quite possibly! But what does it have to do with evolution? \n\n \n Evolution is a tool, taken beyond reasonable limitations to philosophical projections. Remember, the OP wasn't about questioning evolution, it was about questioning evolutionists like Mr Weinberg. The subsequent question that is usually asked of me then is - am I saying that I want products (like clindamycin) to not be produced just because religious people may not want it to be produced? My answer is that it depends on the reasons put fourth by religious people. If the religious people say they don't want it because they believe in prayer over modern medicine, then I usually don't agree with them. But if the religious people say they don't want it because their knowledge of money management as described in the Bible says that our society can't afford it, then I may agree with them. \n \n The ever increasing problem we have in the US is that a demand for a product is often a lot larger than a willingness to pay for that product. Going back to the prop 71 example, Reeve, Fox, Hoffman and Pitt all wanted a product (research results), but they certainly weren't willing to pay for it out of their own pockets. Many, probably most, people who demand new drug technology also demand that their insurance company pay for it. Often they don't stop to think where insurance companies get money, because they don't care. Not caring isn't a good glue to hold a society together. Taxing people for unlimited scientific research is just as wrong as taxing them to redistribute their wealth, because it can be the same thing!\n \n \nAs I said at the outset, I think you're running a lot of ideas together here, without making a careful analysis. When it comes to issues of morality and policy, neither evolution in particular nor science in general can't tell us what we oughtto do. They can tell us how things work, and that's it.\n \n Science could tell you what the effects of abortion are, but it doesn't say when you \"should\" have one -- if ever. Science can explain what happens when you drill for oil, but it doesn't tell you whether you \"ought\" to drill or not. This is what I meant in invoking the is-ought to distinction. \n\n \n I agree - science doesn't. But we're finding that scientists often do. Do you think it's an area of concern when most statistics clearly show that there is a disproportionate balance of scientists who are atheists vs the general public who are atheists? \n \n \n \nIII.A.\n \n \n \n Because Lewontin has always thought that adaptation and natural selection are overestimated, and he has nothing but scorn for applying Darwinism to human beings.\n \n My point is simply that you can't go from Darwinian evolution to values. Some conservatives think it gives you a leftist nightmare. Some liberals think it gives you a right-wing nightmare. Obviously, they can't both be right, at least not in any general sense. The reality is always more complicated than that. \n\n \n It's complicated, but much complicated literature has been written claiming that values can/do come from Darwinian evolution. \n \n \nIV.\n \n \n \n True enough, and I don't mean to deny it! But the question is, is the scientific backing they believed they possessed really something they had? I think in the case of Spencer, the answer is no. He didn't even care for natural selection, because he recognized -- as did Darwin -- that it doesn't necessitate absolute progress, only relative progress. Despite coining the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" for Darwin, Spencer's view of evolution was progressivist and Lamarckian to the core. So I don't think it is at all accurate to treat Darwin's work as if it grounds or implies Spencer's. Needless to say, this applies a fortiori to contemporary evolutionary biology.\n \n Ruse has done some interesting work on this, separating out the metaphysical and value-laden philosophies of evolution (including that held by Darwin himself) from the empirical and value-neutral science of evolution (derived from Darwin's scientific work and refined for over a century now).\n \n \n \n Sure! But how does that show that there's some intrinsic, logical connection between evolution and Spencer's laissez-faire capitalism or other social theories?\n \n It simply doesn't, which is exactly why Wallace could be a socialist and Gould could be a Marxist.\n \n (I hasten to add that it would be just as gross a mistake to think that evolution justifies socialism, too.)\n\n \n My point is that God is either absent or present. If Spencer, Darwin, Lewontin, Dawkins, Wallace, and Gould all have positions that differ greatly, it's very significant that they have one big thing in common, a non-belief in God's involvement. Opinions in US politics vary all over the place, but when all is said and done, we almost always see a two way conflict. It's the reason we have only two major political parties. We always hear the terms \"religious right\" or \"atheist left\" (secular left, humanist left, etc.) but we never hear of \"religious left\" or \"atheist right\", do we? \n \n If Spencer, Darwin, Lewontin, Dawkins, Wallace, and Gould can't agree on anything else, they can always agree on one thing - that the book of Genesis is wrong, that creationists are wrong. It's a big political uniter.\n \n Check this thread - I hope you'll consider investing in this book as well - we'll discuss it here in the next couple of months. :)",

   "[Note: In the interest of full disclosure, I spent a few minutes revising parts of this post this morning. Some of the revisions are fairly substantial. Just thought you should know.]\n \n \nSure you have. On multiple occasions you have attacked my literalist view of interpreting the bible as being motivated by our personal value system.\n\n \n Archie, it is my contention that everyone's interpretation of the Bible is motivated by contingencies of his personal value system, and by much else besides. This applies to the authors of the Bible themselves, to the founders of Christianity, to you, and even -- it should go without saying, but for clarity's sake, I must mention it -- to me.\n \n But I have never said that the fact that it reflects your personal values is why your view (or anyone else's) is false. To do so would clearly be ad hominem. And if that's what you think I've done, then you've misunderstood me.\n \n As to my other complaints, however, those still stand. I have never called you a \"pseudo-Christian\" or a \"mental midget.\" I have never questioned the sincerity of your beliefs or declared you spiritually dead. I have never presumed to know anything about your personal relationship with God. And I have certainly never placed myself on a \"higher plane of understanding\" than you or any other poster.\n \n I am mighty sick and tired of repeatedly receiving such abuse in an ostensibly reasonable discussion.\n \n \nBut what you don't and couldn't know is that prior to being saved I was just like everyone else here who's acting in the flesh rather than the spirit.\n\n \n That's great, Archie. I have found some of your personal comments quite moving.\n \n But how do they solve any of the issues in this debate?\n \n \nYou can't even make the connection that when a verse in the New Testament is speaking about the Lord, that it is referring to Jesus Christ, the Messiah. There is no possible way a spirit filled believer could be blind to such an obvious reference to Messiah.\n\n \n This doesn't even hold up in the Gospels. The first use of \"Lord\" in the New Testament (NIV) is at Matthew 1:20, with its reference to \"an angel of the Lord.\" The term appears throughout the Christmas story, and during neither that passage nor what follows can \"Lord\" be described as an unambiguous reference to the Person of the Son.\n \n Compare similar passages in the beginning of Luke. Note, for example, Luke 1:31-33, when the angel visits Mary:\n \n31 You will be with child and give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus. 32 He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, 33and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever; his kingdom will never end.\n\n \n Or moving to the stage after Jesus' birth, consider Matthew 22: 34-40, an account of \"the Greatest Commandment\":\n \n34 Hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, the Pharisees got together. 35 One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question: 36 \"Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?\" 37 Jesus replied: \"'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' 38 This is the first and greatest commandment. 39 And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' 40 All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.\"\n\n Compare Mark 12: 28-31 or Luke 10:25-28 for two other accounts, both of which also depict Jesus Himself using the expression \"the Lord your God.\"\n \n That's just a handful of passages from the Gospels. The letters of Paul are also filled with references to \"the Lord.\" Many of these unambiguously refer to Christ, for they say things like \"our Lord Jesus Christ.\" But many of them are every bit as ambiguous as the one that occasioned this dispute in the first place, using \"the Lord\" without qualification of any Person.\n \n In any event, I believe your contention, that when it appears in the New Testament, the word \"Lord\" must be interpreted as a reference to the Son, is erroneous.\n \n \nBy questioning the word of God you are questioning Gods truth Matthew.\n\n \n Not so. Even if the narratives aren't literally true, they may still reveal the truth.\n \n You can keep making this charge, but it will never hold water.\n \n \n See verse 22 Matt? ...See verses 23 and 24?...Verses 25 and 26 are obvious to me.\n\n \n When are you going to learn that, since I do not regard the Bible as literal, infallible, or authoritative, that appealing to it is not enough to convince me of anything?\n \n In the first place, I do not believe that the criticism here amounts to \"hate.\"\n \n In the second, I do not think that persecution is a sufficient indicator of rectitude.",

This applies to the authors of the Bible themselves, to the founders of Christianity, to you, and even -- it should go without saying, but for clarity's sake, I must mention it -- to me.\n\n \n Regarding the bolded: That's all the evidence needed to prove that you don't have a personal relationship with God through Christ Matt. If the Holy Spirit indwelled you, you would know and believe that it's inspired by God at every level of your being.\n \n \nBut I have never said that this is the reason why your literalist view is false. To do so would clearly be ad hominem. And if that's what you think I've done, I think you've misunderstood me entirely.\n\n \n It doesn't matter what your motivation is Matt, the fact is that you are more dedicated to debating every aspect of my interpretation of the bible than you are in correcting the deniers of God and His word. You claim to be a follower of Christ yet you are dividing the house by opposing an alleged brother in Christ rather than defending Christ with Him against those who slander and blaspheme God here. You are a blatant hypocrite in your denials and inconsistencies as a so called believer.\n \n Look at subaru's blasphemies? Have you once spoken against him/her? No! in fact once you even referred to his post in a complimentary fashion as you attack my beliefs. But you just don't get it, do you! emoticon_xdonno\n \n \nAs to my other complaints, however, those certainly stand. I have never called you a \"pseudo-Christian\" or a \"mental midget.\" I have never questioned the sincerity of your beliefs or declared you spiritually dead. And I have certainly never placed myself on a \"higher plane of understanding\" than you or any other poster.\n \n And I am mighty sick and tired of repeatedly receiving such abuse in an ostensibly reasonable discussion. \n\n \n Sorry if the truth offends you Matt. You are free to either not respond to my posts or to put me on ignore. If you don't spew your shallow fleshly interpretations of the bible as you oppose me, I wont expose them or you for what they/you are. \n \n \nThat's great, Archie. I have found some of your personal comments quite moving.\n \n But how do they solve any of the issues in this debate?\n\n \n They were attempts to reach YOU with the truth Matt. I'm not here to hurt you or beat you. I'm trying to get you to look inward and to see your spiritual need which can only be satisfied by a personal relationship with the living God. \n \n \nAnd I'm sorry, but this doesn't even hold up in the Gospels. The first use of \"Lord\" in the New Testament (NIV) is at Matthew 1:20. It appears throughout the Christmas story, and during neither that passage nor what follows can \"Lord\" be described as an unambiguous reference to the Person of the Son.\n\n \n Sure it can, and it does. Because the Son, in His eternal position is the Word of God and Lord of all who spoke creation into existence. So the Angel of the Lord was referring to the same person who was to be born to Mary. He even makes it clearer by attributing her pregnancy to the Holy Spirit. How many Lords could the bible be referring to Matt, under such a circumstance?\n \n The problem is that you don't have the Holy Spirit to guide you according to the promise Jesus made to us before He left to prepare a place for us with Him. If you did, this would be a no brainer for you.\n \n \nCompare similar passages in the beginning of Luke. Especially note Luke 1:31-33, when the angel visits Mary : \"31 You will be with child and give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus. 32 He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, 33and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever; his kingdom will never end.\" It is clearly Jesus, the Son, who will be given the throne of David by \"the Lord God.\" So I daresay the author was not saying that the Son would give the throne of David to himself.\n\n \n True, this reference is to Lord God the Father. Again, it's obvious and this time you recognized it accurately. Did I say that every single reference to the Lord in the bible was referring to Jesus? Absolutely NOT. All I said is that your inability to tell when it does is very telling about your spiritual condition. You are attempting to interpret the word with the flesh, and I'm trying to tell you that it isn't possible. Only through the power of the Holy Spirit does Gods word come alive to us. This isn't to say that you can't get where you need to be. I'm only saying that you aren't there yet, spiritually speaking. \n \n \nSo I think if my refusal to accept \"Lord\" as an unambiguous reference to Jesus Christ indicates something horrible about my spiritual discernment to you, you are not reading the Bible all that closely.\n\n \n Again you corrupt what I say. I never said that every reference to the Lord was an unambiguous reference to Jesus. \n \n \nNot so. Even if the words aren't literally true, they may reveal God's truths.\n \n So you can keep making this charge, but it will never hold water.\n\n \n Maybe that's true in your mind, but it isn't true to God. And in the final analysis that is all that matters. \n \n \nWhen are you going to learn that, since I do not regard the Bible as literal, infallible, or authoritative, that appealing to it is not enough to convince me of anything?\n\n \n When are you going to realize that this statement is all the evidence that's required to prove that you aren't a born again christian/believer in Christ as you falsely claim to be. If the Holy Spirit indwelled you according to the promises of Jesus Christ the Savior, you would never make such a statement. You couldn't make such a statement. \n \n This is why my statement is absolutely true that you have more in common with the atheists, the secular humanists and the unbelievers than you have with me. So please stop claiming to be a member of the family of God and a believer who just happens to disagree with a fellow believer Matt. Because we have absolutely nothing at all in common. We are literally from different worlds my friend. \n \n And I have no problem relating to you on that level at all. Nor answering your questions. But to lie to these other unbelievers while claiming the authority of a true believer as you deny the power there of is a serious sin which God will not look kindly on. I repeat Jesus prayer to the Father before dying for our sins, on behalf of TRUE believers.\n Jhn 17:14 I have given them your word and the world has hated them, for they are not of the world any more than I am of the world.\n \n Jhn 17:15 My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one.\n \n Jhn 17:16 They are not of the world, even as I am not of it.\n \n Jhn 17:17 Sanctify [fn] them by the truth; \"your\" word is truth.\n \n If Gods truth was evident in you, this passage would be fulfilled within you.\n \n See the bolded Matthew? The word is the bible which Jesus is calling Gods truth. Your statement above means you are calling both Jesus and Father God a liar. Would a true believer be able to do that? The answer is no. By denying the truth of Gods word you deny God Himself. I don't know how many different ways I can clarify this for you. But with each new post you write, you just further prove how lost you are. Sorry, but it's better that you know the truth of your standing rather than waste a lifetime piously denying the truth of your true standing with the living God. Only after accepting that truth can you move on to find the whole truth which only comes by way of the word of God.",

   "That may very well be, but there's no guarantee that it's always a good thing, if there are costs involved. One of the things that's always said to me on these forums is that evolution (a belief in a common ancestor for both humans and animals) \"works\". I don't agree that it always works, if it puts the interests of animals above those of humans, or imposes questionable costs.\n\n \n I'm afraid I don't understand where you're coming from here. Evolution \"works\" in the scientific sense: it explains disparate phenomena, and it yields testable predictions.\n \n There is nothing about evolution that requires us to place any particular relative value on the interests of humans and animals. I do think that disregarding the interests of animals, and of all other organisms, is deeply unwise even from the standpoint of human interests. For our own long-term existence depends crucially on how well the environment around us continues to function. But this is an entirely general position, which leaves open the question of what particular actions would be wise or unwise. And perhaps more pertinently to this discussion, it's not a position that derives from evolution.\n \n And I really don't understand what you mean by \"questionable costs.\" Do you have in mind the economic side of the \"particular actions\" I alluded to in my preceding paragraph? Because as I said before, I think there are clearly trade-offs that have to be made. But evolutionary biology is not what decides which to make and which not to. Perhaps I've misunderstood you (and perhaps you didn't even have economics in mind).\n \n \nThe movie \"Expelled\", and several books (of both extremes) tell me that it [the atheist take-over of science] may be closer than we think.\n\n \n I confess that I haven't seen Expelled. In part, I will admit, this is because I have heard some very bad things about it, including deception practiced by the film-makers to get some of the biologists to participate. But perhaps I will go and take a look sometime.\n \n \nEver hear of \"The God Delusion\" by Dawkins...\n\n \n Sure. It's a non-science book written by a scientist. I read it. I thought his view of theism was superficial and dismissive of the diversity of theistic options available, and I found his grasp of certain ideas and arguments to be tenuous. On the other hand, I do think he made some good points about the dangers of religious extremism and about morality transcending particular religions, and my favorite part of the book was his evolutionary explanation of why traditions are maintained. Overall, it was decent, but nothing world-changing. Not for me, at least.\n \n \n...or Victor Stengers \"The failed hypothesis - how science shows that God does not exist\"?\n\n \n I've seen it, but I haven't read it. I've read similar arguments before, though, and I don't think that science is capable of showing any such thing. Atheistic philosophers are running a better track, but I don't think they've disproved the existence of God, either.\n \n There are plenty of atheistic scientists and philosophers who actually agree with that assessment (e.g. Michael Ruse or Philip Kitcher).\n \n \nHow about this statement:\n \n \"'Anything we scientists can do to weaken the hold of religion,' says Nobel Prize winner Steven Weinberg, 'should be done and may in the end be our greatest contribution to civilization.'\"\n \n I'm told that statements like that are just one persons opinion, and don't mean a thing. If his statements don't mean anything, how did he get his Nobel Prize?\n\n \n But this is a bit misleading! Because he didn't get his Nobel for his statements about religion. He got it for his statements about science.\n \n I still have trouble thinking that these fellows' views qualify as a take-over of science. There have been scientists themselves, including biologists -- e.g. Ken Miller or Francis Collins or Francisco Ayala -- who reject these guys views on religion, often quite publicly. And they have no trouble at all getting their work published, just as many other religious scientists don't.\n \n \n...am I saying that I want products (like clindamycin) to not be produced just because religious people may not want it to be produced? My answer is that it depends on the reasons put fourth by religious people. If the religious people say they don't want it because they believe in prayer over modern medicine, then I usually don't agree with them. But if the religious people say they don't want it because their knowledge of money management as described in the Bible says that our society can't afford it, then I may agree with them. \n \n The ever increasing problem we have in the US is that a demand for a product is often a lot larger than a willingness to pay for that product. Going back to the prop 71 example, Reeve, Fox, Hoffman and Pitt all wanted a product (research results), but they certainly weren't willing to pay for it out of their own pockets. Many, probably most, people who demand new drug technology also demand that their insurance company pay for it. Often they don't stop to think where insurance companies get money, because they don't care. Not caring isn't a good glue to hold a society together. Taxing people for unlimited scientific research is just as wrong as taxing them to redistribute their wealth, because it can be the same thing!\n\n \n Fair enough. But my point is, this is an economic argument. It has no bearing at all on evolution's merits as biology.\n \n As I've said, there are most definitely economic trade-offs involved here. If you think research into any particular field is not something we can afford, that's fine. You're free to say so, and to vote for people who think so as well. Just as we all are. But no governmental funding decisions will determine what is or isn't correct science.\n \n So I'm afraid that I still don't see your point with this line of argument.\n \n \nDo you think it's an area of concern when most statistics clearly show that there is a disproportionate balance of scientists who are atheists vs the general public who are atheists?\n\n \n No. Science is grounded in empiricism. It is neutral on the metaphsyical question of theism vs. atheism: whether God exists or not, the empirical evidence remains what it is. Because of this neutrality, science has been far more tolerant of atheism than the rest of society. It is only natural that atheists would gravitate there.\n \n And keep in mind that while science is compatible with atheism, it is also compatible with theism. It doesn't require either one.\n \n So no, I don't see any reason to worry.\n \n \nIt's complicated, but much complicated literature has been written claiming that values can/do come from Darwinian evolution.\n\n \n Indeed. But many of those claims are false! This is especially so when one attempts to derive particular ethical injunctions from general features evolved in human nature -- e.g. human beings are evolved to cooperate and therefore ought to be socialists, or men are evolved to be stronger than women and therefore women should not serve in the military.\n \n \nMy point is that God is either absent or present. If Spencer, Darwin, Lewontin, Dawkins, Wallace, and Gould all have positions that differ greatly, it's very significant that they have one big thing in common, a non-belief in God's involvement.\n\n \n But why is that so significant? People like Miller or Collins take quite a different view. What they have in common with the above guys is a belief in evolution, not atheism.\n \n Moreover, I've even read some post-modernists (and I apologize, but no names are coming readily to mind; po-mo is not really my thing) who are atheists but anti-evolutionists (they see both science and religion as efforts at social control).\n \n The questions of whether or not life evolved and whether or not God exists are entirely independent of each other. You could answer either question either way, with no necessary implication for how you must answer the other question.\n \n \nOpinions in US politics vary all over the place, but when all is said and done, we almost always see a two way conflict. It's the reason we have only two major political parties. We always hear the terms \"religious right\" or \"atheist left\" (secular left, humanist left, etc.) but we never hear of \"religious left\" or \"atheist right\", do we?\n\n \n I think that's far too simple. Because there are lots of diverse opinions covered under those blanket groupings. The \"religious right\" is most commonly associated with evangelical Christians, but it also contains many Catholics and Mormons. The \"secular left\" includes Marxists like Gould and non-Marxists like Dawkins, and many an anti-scientific post-modernist comparative literature professor, as well.\n \n And actually there is growing \"religious left\" in this country, as can be seen with people like John Shelby Spong or Jim Wallis or Robert McElvaine. There's also an \"atheist right\" -- just consider Christopher Hitchens, for example.\n \n And there are people who don't neatly fit these categories. For example, the followers of Ayn Rand (also known as Objectivists) are certainly atheists, but like many \"libertarian\"-ish groups, their economic policies seem right-wing while their social policies seem left-wing. And how the heck do we categorize Buddhists?\n \n \nIf Spencer, Darwin, Lewontin, Dawkins, Wallace, and Gould can't agree on anything else, they can always agree on one thing - that the book of Genesis is wrong, that creationists are wrong. It's a big political uniter.\n\n \n You forgot to mention Miller, Collins, Ayala, et al, from the camp of Christian biologists! For you see, it's not a matter of political unity, and still less is it a matter of religious unity. It's a matter of scientific unity. The overwhelming majority have been convinced, on the basis of evidence, that a literal reading of Genesis is, in fact, wrong. Beyond that, however, they have widely divergent views of just how non-literally true and/or otherwise meaningful it is.",

I neither said he is stupid nor that I am infallible. Only that he is wrong and kidding himself. But you atheists and secular humanists go ahead and prove my point by defending his version of Christianity against mine. emoticon_xgood\n \n \nThe fact is Matthew, that you have self righteously challenged me on every single scriptural principle I have shared since you arrived. But rather than back down from your very incorrect personal opinions regarding my knowledge of Gods word and what it means to have a personal relationship with Him according to the gospel, I challenged you with the word itself which never comes back void.\n \n Now since you realize you can't defeat that truth which has corrected every misconception and shallow personal opinion you have offered, you are again, and very consistently attempting to put the blame on me for simply doing what these forums dictate, and that is to debate the issues and prove our positions. \n \n But you know that your positions are unsupportable according to the bible you claim to accept on the one hand but oppose in every debate in which you support whatever view opposes the scriptural perspective. And what I find so sad is that you seem blind to the fact that if you're not for God, then you are against Him. You just posted on another thread that even if evolution was proven wrong, that doesn't mean that another natural method for our existence apart from creation isn't how we got here. \n \n I find that opinion incredible coming from a believer who say's he has a personal relationship with the God of the Genesis account in the bible. But you can't even see the hypocrisy in your inconsistent position. So claim your status as a victim of this bully christian who is only trying to share Gods truth according to His word with you. But had you not self righteously challenged and erroneously opposed every spiritual truth I have shared since you became a member, I never would have had to support my beliefs with the scriptures itself which you can't oppose. \n \n That is why you're walking away from debating me. It isn't because I have arrogantly told you about your relationship with God at all. It's because I have sincerely and honestly shown you that you are kidding yourself to claim you have one. And I've done it with Gods word which is the litmus test for all believers to judge their relationship with Him by. Once again Matt, Jesus said it best, so I will allow Him to summarize my thoughts for you.\n \n Luk 6:46 \"Why do you call Me, 'Lord, Lord,' and do not do what I say?\n \n Luk 6:47 \"Everyone who comes to Me and hears My words and acts on them, I will show you whom he is like:\n \n Luk 6:48 he is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid a foundation on the rock; and when a flood occurred, the torrent burst against that house and could not shake it, because it had been well built.\n \n Luk 6:49 \"But the one who has heard and has not acted {accordingly,} is like a man who built a house on the ground without any foundation; and the torrent burst against it and immediately it collapsed, and the ruin of that house was great.\"\n Think of this parable every time you align yourself with atheists, evolutionists and secular humanists as you stand with them against Gods truths which you claim to accept but never defend.\n",
