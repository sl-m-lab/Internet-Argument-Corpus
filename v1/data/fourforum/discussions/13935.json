   "I am planning to buy an iPad and want your advice to understand few things. Should I buy it on the release date or wait few weeks and which model do you guys recommend to buy?\n \n Any advice and suggestions are welcome.\n Thanks..\n\n \n Here's the issue, nobody can advise you when to buy or what model to buy because your specific needs come into play when making that decision. For example, with the 3G model you must also pay a monthly service fee just as you would for a cell phone. 3G gives you internet access anywhere and anytime. The Wifi model allows you to piggyback on any wifi signal that's available and open such as you would find in an internet cafe, for example. \n \n As for when you should buy it, that is also dependent upon your needs right now. I have an iphone 3G-S so I don't actually need the iPad right now so I'm going to wait for the second generation to come out which I believe will have a camera built in and possibly video phone capabilities which would greatly interest me. In that case I would purchase the 3G model which as I say requires being hooked up to AT&T for a monthly fee. I hope this helps you in some small way. If you have more specific questions, I will be happy to discuss them with you since I am a dedicated Apple fan.\n \n Watch the video's: Apple - iPad",
