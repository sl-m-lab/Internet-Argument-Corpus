   "Only because you asked :)\n \n investigator:\n The perceptive, cerebral type. Fives are alert, insightful, and curious. They are able to concentrate and focus on developing complex ideas and skills. Independent, innovative, and inventive, they can also become preoccupied with their thoughts and imaginary constructs. They become detached, yet high-strung and intense. They typically have problems with eccentricity, nihilism, and isolation. At their Best: visionary pioneers, often ahead of their time, and able to see the world in an entirely new way. \n \n Labels seem silly given the complexity of who most of us are. Even the test showed very high in a number of \"types\", but then labels me as type 5 since it was scored the highest. I also didn't like the questions, but enough complaining :) It's also more of a reflection of how we view ourselves, which can often be different than how we are observed as being by others...\n \n I'm definitely not a #2...I think the best person to decide your needs is you, to require someone else to mind-read and determine your needs, then have them provide those needs, seems inefficient to me ;). Likewise, I think not providing for your own needs is often a result of low self-esteem (other's needs are more important). Amusingly enough I think most of our personality traits are evolutionarily driven, and I think low self-esteem is a very important mechanism of survival, as is social behavior. How's that for convoluted reasoning! :)\n \n Then again I'm sure I'll be more of a type 2 when I have (hopefully) children. Big Orn as grandpa better be a type 2! :)\n \n I must share that when I started reading the thread, I started in the middle, having first read this shockingly funny sentence:\n \n \nYou guys are cracking me up...\n Well since I live with Sinjin I can tell you all he can be a number 2 too...  but somehow I dont think that is his number either....\n\n \n So sinjin can be a real #2... emoticon_wow \n \n -Mach",
