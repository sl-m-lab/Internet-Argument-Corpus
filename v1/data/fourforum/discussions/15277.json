So you really have no room to talk, here.\n \n Regarding your accusation, I don't fear gays (whatever that means exactly). I think people are arguing from the position of what they think is best for society. That's what everyone is doing. If that's to be labeled \"fear\" then so be it, but it's no more a fear than when you argue for society to be a certain way. I find it interesting that your movement often tries to label those who argue against it in a negative light, rather than simply acknowledging these are discussions in the marketplace of ideas that take place in a pluralistic society. It's healthy debate--there's no value in inaccurately trying to generalize one viewpoint as form of \"fear\".\n \n More to the point of the thread, this is a case of curriculum being legislated. In that sense, it certainly is forced, meaning teachers have no choice but teach about the gay pride movement and bow to a political movement's demands for the social validation of its political views. Ideology should not be legislated in the classroom, and this is a big reason why public schools continue to become more and more irrelevant as time goes on--parents don't want a nanny state making liberal political correctness dictate education.

   "Hi Jake, welcome back.\n \n Your point is quite ironic, because gay pride advocates frequently argue that they are being 'forced' by society or religion--Forced, imposed, 'made-to' etc. These are terms your movement uses all the time in its rhetoric. So you really have no room to talk, here.\n \n Regarding your accusation, I don't fear gays (whatever that means exactly). I think people are arguing from the position of what they think is best for society. That's what everyone is doing. If that's to be labeled \"fear\" then so be it, but it's no more a fear than when you argue for society to be a certain way. I find it interesting that your movement often tries to label those who argue against it in a negative light, rather than simply acknowledging these are discussions in the marketplace of ideas that take place in a pluralistic society. It's healthy debate--there's no value in inaccurately trying to generalize one viewpoint as form of \"fear\".\n \n More to the point of the thread, this is a case of curriculum being legislated. In that sense, it certainly is forced, meaning teachers have no choice but teach about the gay pride movement and bow to a political movement's demands for the social validation of its political views. Ideology should not be legislated in the classroom, and this is a big reason why public schools continue to become more and more irrelevant as time goes on--parents don't want a nanny state making liberal political correctness dictate education. Private and home schooling is on the rise, and so you are losing that front.\n\n \n So then you have a problem with teaching black history?",

I fully agree blue states don't like your government-run pubic schools as much, and therefore take responsibility into their OWN hands. So naturally, PUBLIC school performance will be less than states which emphasize PUBLIC-schools, since that's what blue states rely on, but therefore we need to remember that one of the solutions people in these red states use is to rely less of government and use private schooling.\n \n \nI swear.\n The anti-gay side SERIOUSLY needs to get over themselves and this pretense that gays are out for your \"validation\".\n\n \n Sorry, but that's not even a believe-able position you are taking.\n Of COURSE its about validation.

Schools are for math, reading, writing, etc. You know, education.\n \n \nIt's not just about sex either. However, that seems to be your issue as well. When people lost their jobs just because they were gay, it was based on identity, not on what went on in the bedroom. \n\n \n So do we spend class time on every category of people out there over which have lost jobs? If by chance you're a teacher, hope you plan on putting in some awfully LOOOOOOONG days! :p\n \n \nThe latter certainly is no one's damn business. Your side says it's all directly about the sex acts. Well, this is about social history and identity and not about the nitty-gritty of sex acts. \n\n \n Problem is, with this issue, the topic can't be separated from sexuality, because it IS a sexuality-related issue. That's the whole thing. In some respects, basic modesty is a lot of the gay-pride movement's problem.",

They wouldn't be debated otherwise.\n\n \n This particular forum is pretty unique. I don't know of any other forums that have the heading, \"gay rights debates\". I can see how it would draw bigots who debate in circles and have no logical basis for their position. Clearly this forum does so. I wouldn't dream of taking away your right to debate, it helps move gay rights forward by demonstrating the weakness of your position.\n \n \nI don't think it should be a focus in school to teach on 'women and their bodies' either. Moral positions don't need to be the emphasis in schools. It needs to be about education. Has nothing to do with religion or anything else. I wouldn't want a teacher shoving religion down students' throats in class, either.\n\n \n Deliberately not discussing gay history, without a rational reason, but because of prejudice and fear based on a particular religious teaching, is accomplishing the same end of imposing religious dogma.\n \n \nNo more sad than if you didn't use public schools because they were becoming overly religious.

   "emoticon_rolleyes\n It's definitely a tactic of your movement to try and associate disagreement with \"ignorance\". As if the issue isn't a moralistic one therefore not an issue of merely knowledge.\n\n \n That's the problem. Your so-called \"morality\" doesn't involve knowledge. It's dependent on tradition, ignorance, fear and religious dogma.\n \n \nWhooptedo.\n It's 'fully within someone's rights' to scream in someone's face on the street for no reason--doesn't mean it's not stupid.\n\n \n You compare it to that? You're quite defensive.\n \n \nForcing things on people is never a good thing. If you think your ideology is correct, then you should be focusing on convincing people rather than forcing it in society. You of all people--as a gay activist--should know that.\n\n \n Lol. No one's talking about forcing an ideology. You're the only one who wants to do that by avoiding the topic of gay history for no rational reason. The reason you have given is that it will take up all the class's time, which you haven't shown. As foundit said, and as I believe you know, it can be part of the social studies classes. You also said it's about sex, which isn't so. People have their religious beliefs you have also argued. However, those beliefs are tied to disapproval of sex acts, which this isn't about. Were it even about sex acts, different religions have different views. The laity in those religions have different views. It's not up to the public schools to simply tow the Pope's line. It's not convincing that would apply here, because it's teaching history. If it does the Pope has a problem with knowledge.\n \n \nBesides, if you really cared about creationism not being forced in schools, it should all the more make you oppose gay activist ideology being forced in schools.\n \n \n Explain what gay activist ideology is in your view, and how you feel it would be applied to the teaching of history. There has been activism which has led to rights, some of which you actually support. \n \n \nYep, as does 'history' of any sexual-based behavior that's happened in human history. The issue isn't whether or not it \"exists\", but whether or not it warrants being forced as curricula. It's yet another example of distraction from subjects that really MATTER. (ya know, like mathematics, language, OBJECTIVE history, literature, music, etc. But those are non-ideological, so I suppose you don't favor those. emoticon_xangel)\n\n \n Were one being OBJECTIVE, one would see many and great historical changes when it comes to gays in society. One could see it's not about any old sexual behaviour. Now of course you do see this jyoshu, which is why you have as a big concern, the possible social validation of gay people. This would be bad, in your view, why?\n \n [/QUOTE=jyoshu]Abuses have happened in many cases to many groups all through history, and its impossible to cover every example ever. There's nothing about homosexuals that warrant special attention over other abuse examples that aren't covered either.[/QUOTE]\n \n Examples, such as?\n \n \nNah, just history as filtered through a given side's morality and ideology.\n\n \n You could make that claim about all history, to some extent.\n \n \nIf it's time away from serious and pertinent subject material, then yes.\n More important, do you REALLY expect any rational person to believe your push on this is just a \"brief inclusion of gay history\", and that you don't want gay pride be a big a deal in schools as you possibly CAN? Part of the reason people oppose your ilk on these school-issues is that there is always the need to keep you at bay because you all never say where you would stop and put LIMITS on this junk.\n\n \n You're using fear tactics. It's the slippery slope fallacy. Not rational.\n \n \n \nNo, because those weren't groups defined as a truly BEHAVIORAL and MORALISTIC category. And even if it had been about validation for them, that's ok. Society defines gays by who they're hooking up with, frankly, and that's one reason WHY a lot of people don't want a sexual issue legitimized in schools, and taking attention off things that really matter. Not to mention impose on the morality of the parents as they feel should be emphasized with their children. Best to leave moralistic matters out altogether in public schools.\n\n \n YOU ARE TAKING THE MORALISTIC STAND. You are against teaching gay history, and are in support of ignorance and reactions which inform people it's all about who gays are \"hooking up with\". It most certainly is not. It won't take time away from math and spelling. You're so- called morals are based on ignorance and irrational fears, and actually on lies I think you know are lies.",

Gay sex is a perversion and an abomination.\n \n Let's look at the Scriptures and see what you're trying to sweep under the rug in order to try to justify illicit gay sex sin:\n \n Leviticus 18:22 - \"Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable.\" \n \n Leviticus 20:13 - \"If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.\"\n \n Romans 1:26-27 - \"Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.\"\n \n 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 - \"Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.\"\n \n 1 Timothy 1:8-10 - \"But we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully, knowing this: that the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine...\"\n \n Jude 7 - \"In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.\" \n \n There's no gay marriages in the Old Testament; No gay marriages in the New Testament; no gay sex approved anywhere in the Bible.

However if you are referring to the cultural inertia that is older than civilization itself that reflects the biological function of sex good luck trying to stop exposing kids to that. You will have to isolate them from the human race, if you have read Asimov you want solaria.\n \n If you want to go out of your way to make homosexuality known to kids fine but don't expect to do it on tax dollars. I would laugh similarly hard at trying to teach kids about heterosexuality. I am not talking about warning of STD's mind you just this 'indoctrination' you speak of it's a pointless use of money.\n \n That being said I seriously doubt anyone is intentionally indoctrinating kids towards heterosexuality, the culture as a whole is doing that and you are crazy if you think people are going to start hiding the nature of heterosexuality to please you.\n \n \nThe same can be said for heteros.\n\n Well almost the same thing.

Why in the world would you want to limit it only to 'what is necessary' while standardizing homosexuality? Why don't you just grow kids in test tubes? If you give me a line about population control I will gag I'm afraid.\n \n My ideal society is volitional (you can check the informal debate topic for more) and I don't see how anyone could possibly go about establishing a single standard for sexual behavior without violating liberty.",

This is reflected in differing opinions in govt. on gay marriage and so forth. I don't see how anyone could possibly disagree that reality exists.\n \n \nDeliberately not discussing gay history, without a rational reason, but because of prejudice and fear based on a particular religious teaching, is accomplishing the same end of imposing religious dogma.\n\n \n emoticon_wow That just doesn't even make sense. Not focusing on gay history doesn't mean quoting scripture, teaching religion, etc. Not sure where you're getting that silly idea.\n \n \nYou're running from knowledge without a rational reason. We're not talking about preaching an ideology or a dogma in teaching gay history.\n\n \n No, I'm 'running from' unnecessarily emphasizing certain knowledge. or example, there is knowledge that there is a historic presence of prostitution in the U.S.; that doesn't mean we need to dedicate part of curricula to it in schools. If we covered every possible thing out there over which knowledge and history existed, there would never be enough time to cover it all.\n \n \nThat's the problem. Your so-called \"morality\" doesn't involve knowledge. It's dependent on tradition, ignorance, fear and religious dogma.\n\n \n But I'm not the one advocating teaching something here--you are. I'm not fighting to teach my morality. You are.\n \n \nLol. No one's talking about forcing an ideology. You're the only one who wants to do that by avoiding the topic of gay history for no rational reason.\n\n \n Again, the absence of something isn't the presence of another. I'm certain there's a fallacy there in your claim.\n \n \nAs foundit said, and as I believe you know, it can be part of the social studies classes. \n\n \n But why?? What is special about history of same-gender sex and the movement to make it validated that deserves more attention than other things out there that could take up class time? It's not like the gay movement is anything as big as the civil rights movement.\n \n \nYou also said it's about sex, which isn't so.\n\n \n It is, really. I know you don't want that said, but without the issue of sex gay pride wouldn't exist. At the root of things is the issue of sexuality. \n \n \nExplain what gay activist ideology is in your view, and how you feel it would be applied to the teaching of history. There has been activism which has led to rights, some of which you actually support.\n\n \n The ideology is that same-gender sexual relationships should be given attention and played up any chance as possible. People don't want ANY sexual issues trumpeted to kids due to simple standards of modesty--so they sure don't always want gay pride forced on teachers and kids.\n \n The issue of \"gay rights\" that I support is a wholly different issue. Those are just standards of fairness and aren't what this discussion is about. I'm talking about the gay pride movement with their parades, sexual elements, transvestites, blurring the line between boys and girls, associations with the sexual revolution, etc. Frankly, there's a lot of trashiness with your movement, and we don't need it in kids' classrooms, any more than we need other trashy elements of history forced into curriculum. I think it's best not to even teach \"gay rights\" even in the most sterile of ways, because it will only ultimately bring attention and curiosity to all the unseedy elements of your movement. Gay pride only has itself to blame for people not wanting to talk about it.\n \n \nWere one being OBJECTIVE, one would see many and great historical changes when it comes to gays in society. \n\n \n If you were to really sit back and be honest, I think you probably would prefer objectivity to not be the rule here. Seriously now, objectively, gays make up no more than a few percentage points of humanity. There is already WAY more attention given to gays than any other comparably sized category of humanity over anything else. It's not like your your history is that important, really, to humanity. I'm not trying to belittle you, I promise. I just tend to be realist, and the reality is that \"gay history\" is just not that big of a deal to most people, and it's really the equivalent of a footnote in the grand scheme of things. That's being objective. And I suspect you really don't want to go there. :)\n \n \nOne could see it's not about any old sexual behaviour. Now of course you do see this jyoshu, which is why you have as a big concern, the possible social validation of gay people. This would be bad, in your view, why?\n\n \n For the reasons I've given above. It IS an unseedy movement, and that's why. The giving of rights over sexual issues may be valid, but that doesn't mean we need to expose kids to it.\n \n \nExamples, such as?\n\n \n I'd be glad to give you examples:\n Religion, for instance (much more abuse than gays have experience, historically). Where is your demand that we cover religious history in schools? Abuse people experience over obesity. Abuse people experience over handicapps. How about the mentally ill, shunned by society historically? The list goes on, and on, and on. Where's your fighting for these issues to be included in curriculum? What makes gay-related issues more important than these, to where gay-history deserves such classroom time?\n \n \nYou could make that claim about all history, to some extent.\n\n \n Yes, that's the point! Why is gay history special to where you force it into schools when there are so many issues of abuse out there?\n \n \nWhy does your side fear pushing gay pride?\n\n \n I don't think ANY ideology of pride should be pushed in schools. The same goes for nationalism, religion, etc. I see no reason gay pride should be an exception. \n \n \nDo you think it would mean people coming out of the closet?\n\n \n No, I think it's more a concern over further desensitizing children further to sexual issues in culture. You probably don't mind them being exposed to sexual matters, but I do, and I think MOST people do. These are just basic standard of modesty.\n \n \nAfrican Americans and women were expected to behave in certain inferior ways, which didn't let them be who they are in their full potential as humans.\n\n \n But African American history isn't ultimately related to sexual issues. It doesn't violate anyone's standards of modesty and morality. It's about race.",

What you're doing is like pointing out that left handed people are exposed from day one to a mostly right-handed world--right-handed desks in schools, right-handed computer keyboards and the mouse always laying to the right of the keyboard, right-handed scissors, etc. Anything made for lefties is the exception. This is ok--the world is mostly right-handed and we lefties deal with it. The world is also mostly heterosexual. It is therefore pretty normal for most entertainment to present opposite-gender relationships and so forth.

   "Prov, I'm condensing my responses to all three of your recent posts to me into one post.\n\n \n How eco-friendly of you.\n \n \nIt's still a controversial issue in society; it's always an issue at elections, for instance. This is reflected in differing opinions in govt. on gay marriage and so forth. I don't see how anyone could possibly disagree that reality exists.\n\n \n That's really subjective though. How do you intend to determine when it can be taught, when there is no longer sufficient controversy in your view? This avoids why it is controversial. We're just talking about teaching history. Surely, if people can talk about it and put forth their opinions, we should be able to teach history. Why are some afraid of getting that information out there in an educational setting? I think the bigots are afraid there is no reason for their positions.\n \n \nemoticon_wow That just doesn't even make sense. Not focusing on gay history doesn't mean quoting scripture, teaching religion, etc. Not sure where you're getting that silly idea.\n\n \n You're not wanting it to be taught because of your religious views. That's not a reason. Thus, your religion is by default, pulling the strings of the educational system.\n \n \nNo, I'm 'running from' unnecessarily emphasizing certain knowledge. or example, there is knowledge that there is a historic presence of prostitution in the U.S.; that doesn't mean we need to dedicate part of curricula to it in schools. If we covered every possible thing out there over which knowledge and history existed, there would never be enough time to cover it all.\n\n \n We can certainly see that gays have achieved more and made a greater contribution to our understanding of psychology, Constitutional law, and civil rights and equality. \n \n \nBut I'm not the one advocating teaching something here--you are. I'm not fighting to teach my morality. You are.\n\n \n By deliberate omission it's like \"don't ask don't tell\", ignore the elephant in the room, because it might make some people uncomfortable. \n \n \nBut why?? What is special about history of same-gender sex and the movement to make it validated that deserves more attention than other things out there that could take up class time? It's not like the gay movement is anything as big as the civil rights movement.\n\n \n gays have made a great contribution to our understanding of psychology, Constitutional law, and civil rights and social equality and human rights. The gay rights movement is a part of the civil rights and human rights movement. It's fought for non-discrimination. It's had a big presence politically, which is why there is all the push-back by those who do not believe gays should be treated equally to straight people.\n \n \nIt is, really. I know you don't want that said, but without the issue of sex gay pride wouldn't exist. At the root of things is the issue of sexuality.\n \n \n We're not talking about teaching the rightness or wrongness of same-sex sex acts, as I've already explained. That would be taking a moral stand, the only one you claim your church is interested in, but obviously it's interested in doing a lot more to prevent education. \n \n \nThe ideology is that same-gender sexual relationships should be given attention and played up any chance as possible. People don't want ANY sexual issues trumpeted to kids due to simple standards of modesty--so they sure don't always want gay pride forced on teachers and kids.\n\n \n Then by all means. I hope you are just as upset at kids talking about their heterosexually married mother and father, knowing that this is a sexual relationship. This is a total red herring. We're talking about history, the fight for non-discrimination and equal treatment for gay people as full persons, in their HUMAN relationships. \n \n \nThe issue of \"gay rights\" that I support is a wholly different issue. Those are just standards of fairness and aren't what this discussion is about.\n\n \n It certainly is about that, and only about that.\n \n \nI'm talking about the gay pride movement with their parades, sexual elements, transvestites, blurring the line between boys and girls, associations with the sexual revolution, etc. Frankly, there's a lot of trashiness with your movement, and we don't need it in kids' classrooms, any more than we need other trashy elements of history forced into curriculum. I think it's best not to even teach \"gay rights\" even in the most sterile of ways, because it will only ultimately bring attention and curiosity to all the unseedy elements of your movement. Gay pride only has itself to blame for people not wanting to talk about it.\n\n \n What nonsense. Heterosexuals have Mardi-Gras, the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders, women in bikinis in beer ads(like they'd go for guys who drink beer). My gosh, it's mostly the women only who are sexualized too. Seen a music video, a Girls Gone Wild commercial? I think the problem here, is when they see a guy in speedoes(who obviously worked very hard on his abs) dancing on a gay pride float on a hot summer day, they are just not accustomed to seeing MEN being sexualized in this culture. They are certainly not used to seeing gays act like straights act. By the way, the sexual revolution was all about straight men getting what they want. This is still largely the case in the world today, with some changes. Gays have one day a year to grab some attention in a very heterosexual-sexualized world. \n \n \nIf you were to really sit back and be honest, I think you probably would prefer objectivity to not be the rule here. Seriously now, objectively, gays make up no more than a few percentage points of humanity. There is already WAY more attention given to gays than any other comparably sized category of humanity over anything else. It's not like your your history is that important, really, to humanity. I'm not trying to belittle you, I promise. I just tend to be realist, and the reality is that \"gay history\" is just not that big of a deal to most people, and it's really the equivalent of a footnote in the grand scheme of things. That's being objective. And I suspect you really don't want to go there. :)\n\n \n It's not a numbers game. There are more than answer those surveys. Numbers seem to be consistent no matter how much bigotry there is, and how much homosexuality is oppressed. I mean, you can't have it both ways. You say gays are such a small number and not significant, yet you fight against equal marriage for gay couples because you believe it threatens straight marriages. Millions were spend tying to amend Constitutions to prevent gay marriages. People have discriminated against gays in every way imaginable. Gays have had a social history that has fought against the discrimination, bias, and being seen as a pathology. This has been done by gays and straight allies. Every step of the way, there have been many bigots trying to stop us. Were you to really believe we were not significant as you claim, this would hardly be the case. \n \n \nFor the reasons I've given above. It IS an unseedy movement, and that's why. The giving of rights over sexual issues may be valid, but that doesn't mean we need to expose kids to it.\n\n \n Garbage. There are many examples of heterosexual seediness. This is the tired line that gays are a threat to children. It's similar to blood-libel myth. That is the myth that Jews take Christian children and sacrifice them in blood rituals.\n \n \nI'd be glad to give you examples:\n Religion, for instance (much more abuse than gays have experience, historically).\n\n \n I don't think so. Anyway, Christians were pretty small in numbers during that time, and in those places currently, so surely by your logic, it doesn't matter. No offense.\n \n \nWhere is your demand that we cover religious history in schools?\n\n \n I believe it is covered, as history. There are so many different religions, clearly they are not going to make the teaching of one history mandatory.\n \n \nAbuse people experience over obesity. Abuse people experience over handicapps. How about the mentally ill, shunned by society historically? The list goes on, and on, and on. Where's your fighting for these issues to be included in curriculum? What makes gay-related issues more important than these, to where gay-history deserves such classroom time?\n\n \n I think I've already explained that. A great deal has occurred in the place of gays in our society. It used to be a pathology. It used to be something people could discriminate against in every way possible. Now, we are re-defining marriage to include gay couples. Again, that's something you rail against, because gays are too small and insignificant to every have an impact right....? Why aren't you at least being more Machevellian on this, you and your ilk? \n \n \nYes, that's the point! Why is gay history special to where you force it into schools when there are so many issues of abuse out there?\n\n \n Yep. We've come a long way baby. From being burned at the stake, to being included in marriage.\n \n \nI don't think ANY ideology of pride should be pushed in schools. The same goes for nationalism, religion, etc. I see no reason gay pride should be an exception.\n \n \n Well, how could we go about ENSURING that doesn't happen. You were worried it would lead to gay pride, teaching gay history. So what if it does? We're not talking about directly saying \"you must be proud\". But I think that's just another red herring. I don't see a problem.\n \n \nNo, I think it's more a concern over further desensitizing children further to sexual issues in culture. You probably don't mind them being exposed to sexual matters, but I do, and I think MOST people do. These are just basic standard of modesty.\n\n \n I'm all for modesty, provided it works both ways. However, that's not what we're talking about here. You have no evidence they will teach anything not age-appropriate. This is just an example of you stoking prejudice and fear. I'm not sure you even really believe it. You need an education if you do. Red herring. \n \n \nBut African American history isn't ultimately related to sexual issues. It doesn't violate anyone's standards of modesty and morality. It's about race.\n\n \n It was considered the morality at the time for women and blacks to know their place as lower-class members of society. Giving women the vote was thought to be a threat to the family. Inter-racial couples couldn't be involved because of racism. It was thought a black man would harm a white woman, just because they danced together. You're really fixated on homosexual sex, but statistically normal people are not.",

Gay sex is a perversion and an abomination.\n \n Let's look at the Scriptures and see what you're trying to sweep under the rug in order to try to justify illicit gay sex sin:\n \n Leviticus 18:22 - \"Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable.\" \n \n Leviticus 20:13 - \"If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.\"\n \n Romans 1:26-27 - \"Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.\"\n \n 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 - \"Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.\"\n \n 1 Timothy 1:8-10 - \"But we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully, knowing this: that the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine...\"\n \n Jude 7 - \"In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.\" \n \n There's no gay marriages in the Old Testament; No gay marriages in the New Testament; no gay sex approved anywhere in the Bible.

Give me some credit for intelligence.\n\n \n I think debate is fun, and this is a controversial topic. It takes all of a few minutes of time to make a post--not much. \n \n \nOk, caps off. Sexuality is important to our lives. This is why it is featured so much in movies, TV, books. I get asked all the time by people who have just met me if I have a girlfriend. I get told by straight guys that they think a girl is hot. Straight people put pictures of their husbands and wives on their desks at work. They are making an issue of sexuality and their orientation, I am not!\n\n \n No, they're not making an issue of sexuality. They aren't trying to say \"I'm straight.\" That's what I'm trying to get you to understand. It's not about orientation to most people. Their identity is not about their sexuality, and that's the difference between most people and the gay pride movement. Look, I'm not even saying most GAYS make sexuality their identity. I'm talking about the pride movement you're in, not people who are gay. So calm down.\n When movies portray a romance, they aren't doing it to portray that the couple is straight. They aren't out to say that. You may see that in everything, but that's not what most of it's about.",

   "Well, yeah. You're talking about issues RELATED to homosexuality. And everyone knows the word 'partner' when referring to a spouse usually means they don't want to say 'wife' so they are probably in a homosexual relationship.\n \n \n Partner doesn't necessarily equal gay. But whatever. We'll say husband and wife from now on, just so you don't think we are making an \"issue\" of our homosexuality.\n \n \nWell, I think a more important reason against gays expressing their sexuality is that it is against the norms of society. it's not considered modest, at this point in time, anyway.\n\n \n That's extremely subjective. It's looked down upon by some, I don't think you can still say by most, because of bigotry or tradition. Lousy reasons. It doesn't mean it's correct or just to see it as inferior. It's statistically against the norm. Also a very weak reason. \n \n \nNo, they're not making an issue of sexuality. They aren't trying to say \"I'm straight.\" That's what I'm trying to get you to understand. It's not about orientation to most people.

Simply accept and not discriminate against those who portray themselves as gay, and no one will have to actually say they are gay. Gays will just take their acceptance non-discrimination and inclusion for granted like straight people. Will that make you happy, less \"annoyed\"? We'll do anything for you, Jyoshu. However, meanwhile, the history did happen. The history I am talking about is where gays were identified as gay, using the word \"gay\" or \"homosexual\" or \"lesbian, by themselves and by others, and subject to discrimination. Yes, this occurred even without using the actual language of identity. That's been a story for us and for this society, which has come a long way and continues to evolve.",

Obesity is not necessarily about over-eating. There can be many factors, that is one. That urge to overeat is very complicated to discuss. There are many theories both natural and ones related to socio-economics. One factor for instance, may be an unavailability of regular food. When a person does get food, they gorge themselves. Metabolic rates are a factor. Marketing of fattening fast food comes into play. Inactivity may also be a contributor. In other words, it's a whole other debate. You just can't pull anything out of a hat because it occurs within a statistical minority, and say it's like homosexuality. \n \n \nI agree and have always made it plain that I believe that homosexuals should be allowed to pursue their chosen lifestyle without molestation.\n I do not agree that their chosen lifestyles are any better than other lifestyles that are forbidden by law today.Thats why I believe that before legalising gay ' marriages' there should be a revision of what constitutes marriage .\n\n \n Well, don't hold your breath, waiting for that to happen. Equal marriage for same-sex couples is happening all over, without anything else you may be thinking of.\n \n \nI dont believe that gays have any significant history which is worth studying.\n\n \n OK, you don't believe that.\n \n \nIf you want schools to teach the history of gay persecution then thats fine by me,\n\n \n Oh wait, now you are OK with it!\n \n \nas long as every other persecuted minority is included in these studies.\n What we want to teach children is that any kind of general discrimination is bad for society not just ' gay' persecution\n\n \n Those histories would be under different titles. Yes, I agree all discrimination is bad and we should be teaching this. I'm glad you also agree that anti-gay discrimination is bad for society.\n \n \nWhat you want is gay propaganda and demonising of Christians.\n You want schools to teach that anything other than complete acceptance of gay rights dogma is tantamount to homophobia.\n This is not gay history it is gay propaganda.\n\n \n However, you agreed with the teaching of gay history in the quotes above. You also said gays have been persecuted. Surely then you must accept gay rights as the remedy to that persecution. Where do you get that I want to demonize Christians by teaching the history you yourself support?",

   "It's definitely a tactic of your movement to try and associate disagreement with \"ignorance\". As if the issue isn't a moralistic one therefore not an issue of merely knowledge.\n\n This is a strawman argument. I am not doing that.\n I am talking about REAL ignorance.\n Like trying to equate gays with pedophiles.\n Like thinking that being gay is a \"choice\".\n \n If you can point to me ACTUALLY confusing an issue of morality with ignorance, then please point it out.\n Otherwise, please leave the strawman out of this...\n \n \n \nWhooptedo.\n It's 'fully within someone's rights' to scream in someone's face on the street for no reason--doesn't mean it's not stupid. Forcing things on people is never a good thing.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n You mean like \"forcing\" people to get kicked out of the military?\n Or like \"forcing\" people with laws that prevents their legal recognition?\n emoticon_xdonno\n \n I hate to break it to you, but SCHOOL CURRICULA is something that is expected to be set by the state.\n You labelling it as \"forcing things\" is a boring propagandic response that lacks real meaning.\n \n \n \nIf you think your ideology is correct, then you should be focusing on convincing people rather than forcing it in society. You of all people--as a gay activist--should know that.\n\n Again with the strawman arguments.\n THIS IS ABOUT KNOWLEDGE.\n HISTORY\n \n This isn't \"morality\" class. But a HISTORY of gays.\n Quit trying to pretend this is about the \"morality\" of it and focus on the facts of the legislation.\n \n \n \nAnd this has nothing to do with your straw man of creation science--you really need to find someone to levy these silly strawmen of yours at someone who's less libertarian; I wouldn't support forcing teachers to teach creationism either, so that analogy isn't going to get you off the hook.\n\n You need to look up the meaning of \"straw man\".\n I talked about THE RIGHT talking about creationism.\n I never said you supported pushing creationism in schools. emoticon_xdonno\n \n \n \nBesides, if you really cared about creationism not being forced in schools, it should all the more make you oppose gay activist ideology being forced in schools. \n\n Do you understand the concept of CURRICULA.\n \n \"creationism\" shouldn't be taught in science class because \"creationism\" is not science.\n If we were arguing that gay history should be taught in MATH class, then you would have a point.\n \n But that's not what's going on.\n So you're WAYYYYY off base.\n \n \n \nYep, as does 'history' of any sexual-based behavior that's happened in human history. The issue isn't whether or not it \"exists\", but whether or not it warrants being forced as curricula.\n\n And as I pointed out earlier, BASED ON THE IGNORANCE of the right, the answer is clearly \"yes\".\n \n Another example of the ignorance of the right?\n People who keep trying to pretend that the NEW position of the goal-posts is supposedly how things have always been.\n Like people who don't recognize that pushing sodomy as illegal used to be the majority position of the right.\n Like people who don't recognize that gays were also a target in the Holocaust.\n \n The ignorance of the right abounds.\n \n \n \nIt's yet another example of distraction from subjects that really MATTER. (ya know, like mathematics, language, OBJECTIVE history, literature, music, etc. But those are non-ideological, so I suppose you don't favor those. )\n\n If you're looking for an example of \"strawman\", what you just did would be \"strawman\"...\n \n \n \nAbuses have happened in many cases to many groups all through history, and its impossible to cover every example ever. There's nothing about homosexuals that warrant special attention over other abuse examples that aren't covered either.\n\n See?\n THAT is an example of the IGNORANCE! emoticon_xgood\n Thanks for providing it...\n \n First off, gays were killed alongside Jews in the Holocaust.\n The marginalization of gays has occurred throughout history.\n Heck. Some people on the right have attempted to use how MANY societies have discriminated against gays as an argument to show it is justified... emoticon_frazzled\n \n And you claim it's nothing special as compared to other groups?\n Ha!\n \n \n \nNah, just history as filtered through a given side's morality and ideology. You're trying to inject political parties into this, and that won't fly either. What other straw man are you going to bring up? \n\n Again, you SERIOUSLY need to google \"straw man\" and educate yourself on it.\n You keep misusing the term.\n \n \n \nIf it's time away from serious and pertinent subject material, then yes.\n\n Honestly dude?\n You attempting to cut out parts of my argument only shows me what you can't respond to.\n \n I'll just simply repeat it...\n That's just silly...\n The EXISTING Social Studies / History class will simply have another item to talk about...\n \n It's not like people are saying \"We're taking 45 minutes from the previous hour per day for math class to teach gay history\".\n \n \n Nope. Just another segment for an EXISTING class segment.\n If anybody can show me how ANY other course like math, science, or English has to give up time for \"gay history\" I would welcome it.\n Without that, your argument is just absurd and unsubstantiated.\n \n \n \nMore important, do you REALLY expect any rational person to believe your push on this is just a \"brief inclusion of gay history\", and that you don't want gay pride be a big a deal in schools as you possibly CAN? \n\n Again, you need to LOOK UP STRAW MAN ARGUMENT...\n Cause AGAIN, what you're doing now is a STRAW MAN ARGUMENT.\n \n What I stated is my position.\n If you can't deal with it, then the least you can do is not misrepresent my position...\n \n \n \nPart of the reason people oppose your ilk on these school-issues is that there is always the need to keep you at bay because you all never say where you would stop and put LIMITS on this junk. \n\n \"my ilk\"\n Ahhh. Jyoshu...\n If I gave a rat's patootie about your opinion, that coulda hurt.\n emoticon_xangel\n \n \n \nMeh.\n Typical assumption on your part of cause when no causality is demonstrated.\n\n ROFLMAO!!!\n OMG. I forgot how hilarious you can be...\n \n I quoted that TO DISPROVE YOUR assumptions on cause and causality.\n And then you turn around and pretend I am doing what you just did???\n \n The hypocrisy is rank. emoticon_xgood\n \n \n \nOne of the very reasons these states are \"RED\" in order to better address the problem of poor school performance.\n\n And then you give me ANOTHER example of hypocrisy regarding your claim of \"typical assumption on your part of cause when no causality is demonstrated\"... emoticon_xgood\n \n \n \nAnd more importantly, the only way the comparison really matters is to factor in PRIVATE school performance...\n\n LOL.\n I'm not letting you drag this off topic to a ridiculous degree...\n YOU claimed that the failure in the schools had a problem with \"ideology on social-controversy\".\n I disproved this by showing that the schools that SHOULD FARE WORSE (liberal schools by your assumptions) actually do better...\n \n \n \nSorry, but that's not even a believe-able position you are taking.\n Of COURSE its about validation. I didn't say it had anything to do with \"us\" or whatever group you mean by \"you guys\". It's about validation in the eyes of society in general. You have your head in the sand of you don't think so.\n\n Ahh yes.\n The anti-gay person telling a pro-gay person how pro-gay people think.... :xbanghead\n \n YET AGAIN, you need to look up the phrase \"strawman argument\" and UNDERSTAND what it means cause yet again, what you just did?\n That's a strawman argument. emoticon_xgood\n \n \n \nNo, because those weren't groups defined as a truly BEHAVIORAL and MORALISTIC category.\n\n Again, not recognizing the significance of history... emoticon_rolleyes\n Cause when it came to blacks and women, it WAS about morals.\n Not morals YOU share today, but for the people of yesteryear their position WAS based on morality.\n \n Often, CLAIMED CHRISTIAN morality. A popular choice for attempting to justify prejudice...\n \n And as for \"behavioral\", that's the nature of the prejudice and bigotry.\n They claimed it was about behavior \"X\" with women and behavior \"Y\" with blacks.\n Just like today, the anti-gay proponents claim it's about \"behavior\" but often their actions give them away...\n Like gays in the military. The policy affected people regardless of whether they were known to have gay sex.\n Gay adoption. Policy didn't care about whether the adoptive parent was actually having gay sex.\n \n \n \nAnd even if it had been about validation for them, that's ok. Society defines gays by who they're hooking up with, frankly, and that's one reason WHY a lot of people don't want a sexual issue legitimized in schools, and taking attention off things that really matter. Not to mention impose on the morality of the parents as they feel should be emphasized with their children. Best to leave moralistic matters out altogether in public schools.\n\n I fully support \"moralistic matters\" being left out of schools.\n Including the issue of gay morality.\n \n But I think what REALLY scares the anti-gay proponents, deep down, is the fact that if gay history is taught...\n It doesn't look good for the anti-gay proponents who come off as bullies or worse killers.",

NO ONE here is saying that gay pride is not a part of history. The issue is what parts of history is going to get class-time. Because frankly, there are waaaay more important events in history that you apparently think should get LESS attention than your pet issue. And that's your MORALITY coming through. I've asked this several times, and no one including you has answered it (yet you complain when OTHER people ignore questions): what is it about gay history that makes it more special than other things in history we don't have time to cover, either?\n \n Furthermore, it's fascinating that, when asked about WHY you all want gay history taught despite being such a tiny footnote of history, it's usually justified over MORALISTIC reasons, like helping people who might be gay to know it's normal or to help address (indirectly) the issue of gay bullying. So don't act like moralism isn't what this is about. It most certainly IS. \n \n \nAnother example of the ignorance of the right?\n People who keep trying to pretend that the NEW position of the goal-posts is supposedly how things have always been.\n\n \n Oh Foundit.\n I don't think you want to go there--when it comes to moving goalposts. :)\n \n Now are you done bit@hing and whining about \"the right\"?

You keep arguing as if you're just benignly wanting history taught and that's all this has anything to do with. Nah, if it were just about history, you'd be pushing for OTHER MORE historic events to take the time you want covered. This is about your politics and ideology. You want gay pride in schools, and that's the bottom line.  Stop trying to avoid that reality.\n \n \nI'll just simply repeat it...\n That's just silly...\n The EXISTING Social Studies / History class will simply have another item to talk about...\n\n \n And I'll simply repeat the obvious problem with that ...\n there are oodles of examples of more \"items\" out there that could be taking up time.

Because frankly, there are waaaay more important events in history that you apparently think should get LESS attention than your pet issue.\n\n That is YOUR OPINION based on YOUR POLITICAL VIEWS.\n You have yet to acknowledge the situation I have spelled out for you.\n You have yet to ATTEMPT TO CONTRADICT the situation I have noted.\n \n Instead, all you got is you have an OPINION that other things are more important.\n Well, you're entitled to your opinion. emoticon_xgood\n But it's not the one that California has gone with.\n \n Furthermore, if you can show another topic that does have more ignorance on the issue, I'll happily consider it.\n But that DOES NOT detract the need for gay history to be taught based on clear examples of prolific ignorance.\n \n \n \nI've asked this several times, and no one including you has answered it (yet you complain when OTHER people ignore questions): what is it about gay history that makes it more special than other things in history we don't have time to cover, either?\n\n Either this is self-imposed head-in-the-sand complex or a blatant lie on your part.\n I HAVE ALREADY ADDRESSED this. The IGNORANCE regarding gays is astounding and needs to be addressed.\n \n Do you see other people thinking blacks \"choose\" to be black?\n Of course not, but that delusion exists around gays.\n I have given multiple examples of ignorance of gays, and NOT ONCE have you tried to throw out a group that competes with that level of ignorance about gays...\n \n All you're doing is pretend people haven't answered the question that I have CLEARLY addressed. emoticon_ic\n \n \n \nFurthermore, it's fascinating that, when asked about WHY you all want gay history taught despite being such a tiny footnote of history...\n\n ROFLMAO!\n Isn't it funny how YOU REPEATEDLY point out how homosexuality is such a big controversy?\n And here, you try to diminish the whole thing cause that doesn't suit you... emoticon_frazzled\n \n \n \nOh Foundit.\n I don't think you want to go there--when it comes to moving goalposts. \n\n Oh Jyoshu.\n I am HAPPY to challenge you to back up your innuendo, but we both know you don't have what it takes to back that claim up...\n Unless you're going to continue to try to misrepresent my position and statements... \n \n \n \nNow are you done bit@hing and whining about \"the right\"? Or are you going to keep up your little rant tantrum all day? \n\n ROFLMAO!\n You are just too absurd for words!\n I mean, you JUST GOT FINISHED \"bit@hing and whining\" about how supposedly nobody has answered your question...\n \n ... and then WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE to me answering your question?\n You want to just claim it is \"bit@hing and whining\"... emoticon_wow\n \n I'll HAPPILY stop \"bit@hing and whining about 'the right'\" if you'll simply admit to the pervasive ignorance which I had to expose in order to answer your question...\n \n In short sweet-heart?\n Don't ask questions you don't want the answers to... \n \n \n \nSo we should also provide class time for Polish people since they were targeted far MORE in the holocaust than gays? See what I mean? Are you SURE you want to continue this like of thought? Because I don't think ya do.\n\n If I heard a wide-scale demonstration that people didn't think Polish people were targeted in that way, I would happily see a need for that.\n Your reply seems to pretend that \"gays in the holocaust\" is the only issue at hand.\n But it clearly is not.\n It's one piece of a much large puzzle of ignorance. emoticon_xgood\n \n \n \nAgain, cut the XXXX. You keep arguing as if you're just benignly wanting history taught and that's all this has anything to do with. Nah, if it were just about history, you'd be pushing for OTHER MORE historic events to take the time you want covered. This is about your politics and ideology. You want gay pride in schools, and that's the bottom line.  Stop trying to avoid that reality.\n\n Dude. STOP with the strawman.\n Accept my position for what it is or allow me to continually expose you as either a bald-faced liar or head-in-the-sand denier...\n \n \n \nAnd I'll simply repeat the obvious problem with that ...\n there are oodles of examples of more \"items\" out there that could be taking up time. Why add YOUR pet issue?\n\n As I have already answered.\n There is a pervasive problem with ignorance of gays.\n Here's an example of bad the problem is...\n Poll: 47% Of Americans Think Being Gay Is A Choice | The New Civil Rights Movement\n \n \n \n[Foundit's proverbial schoolyard 'nya, nya, nta, I'm rubber you're glue. Whatever you say bounces off me and sticks to you.\" LOL]\n\n Oh. I know.\n And your reference to \"my ilk\" deserved SOOO much more of an intellectual response, didn't it... emoticon_frazzled\n \n Look Jyoshu.\n You give quality discussion comments and I'll respond with quality.\n You fumble around with stupid \"your ilk\" comments, and I'll treat your statement for what it is.\n If you don't like the level of my comment, then give me quality. Not prejudice.\n \n \n \nNothing off-topic about it. It show the obvious holes with the claims YOU made about red/blue states and education.\n\n It was ENTIRELY off topic, as my comment was SOLELY addressing your accusation regarding \"special topics\" and liberal topics.\n Private schools have no relevance to that focus.\n \n \n \nNah, gay-related issues are much more intertwined with behavior and action than those examples. Furthermore, a person who refuses to engage in any same-sex behavior might as well (for all practical purposes) not be called gay. The same can't be said for skin color or gender.\n\n Again...\n YOU would not say the same NOW for skin or gender...\n BACK THEN, that WAS a characteristic of their approach.\n \n And incidentally, I'll just remind you that when you ignore arguments because you can't address them, I'm just going to repeat them...\n \n And as for \"behavioral\", that's the nature of the prejudice and bigotry.\n They claimed it was about behavior \"X\" with women and behavior \"Y\" with blacks.\n Just like today, the anti-gay proponents claim it's about \"behavior\" but often their actions give them away...\n Like gays in the military. The policy affected people regardless of whether they were known to have gay sex.\n Gay adoption. Policy didn't care about whether the adoptive parent was actually having gay sex.\n \n \n \nAnd yet furthermore, you keep bringing up these historical examples as if gay-related issues aren't to be determined on the issue's own merits. Just because it happened (or didn't) a certain way with skin color doesn't mean the same applies when it comes to gay relationships.\n\n Again, I AM TALKING ABOUT EDUCATION.\n \n I'm happy to let people judge for themselves BASED ON THE FACTS.\n The right is obviously not as comfortable with that, and you are blending into that...\n \n \n \nSo you support anti-bullying initiatives being left out?\n\n emoticon_frazzled\n Bullying is against the rules. THAT is why the initiatives exist.\n Ergo, you're talking apples and oranges.\n \n \n \nYou support gay-straight alliances being left out?\n\n \"gay-straight alliances\" are extra-curricular issues.\n I don't want them taught in history class, other than a possible recognition that they exist and any relevant FACTS on the issue...\n \n \n \nAhh yes.\n The anti-religious person telling a religious person how religious people think....\n\n I'm not anti-religious.\n And I can give examples of some of those religious people I am talking about, if you like.\n But I can't help but note that you are not really contesting that this mentality exists amongst some Christians.\n You're just complaining that I'm noting it...\n \n \n \nBut don't worry Foundit--I never underestimate your ability to portray those you hate with the worst possible claims of intentions you can come up with.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n So which is it?\n Am I desparate for validation? Or do I hate the people I supposedly want to validate me?\n \n I don't \"hate\" those who want to deny me equality, and I did not claim any sort of \"worst possible claims of intentions\".",

   "Dude, the whole issue of homosexuality normalcy IS a moralistic issue.\n\n \n How would you define \"homosexual normalcy\"? No one is talking about taking a moral position that gay sex acts are right or wrong. That's an issue for your church, Jyoshu. We're looking at history.:xbanghead\n \n \nAnd that's part of the hypocrisy of your movement that I've been pointing out. On one hand you complain all the time about being forced; then you turn right around and support forcing something in schools when it fits YOUR views of what you want people focused on. (your priorities)\n \n Cut the XXXX here. That's really what this is all about. You have a certain thing that you think should be taught because it fits your PC moralistic views and so you support it. You can dance around that all day, but that's the real issue here.\n \n Which makes it even ALL THE MORE important to make sure special interest groups don't co-opt it with their political priorities and views. What you're pointing out here only hurts your cause even more because you admit its a government control thing.\n\n \n LOL, yes of course public schools are government controlled! Who would be foolish enough to suggest otherwise, certainly not foundit! Gays have been a part of history, affecting really big societal changes. You don't want us to teach these facts, jyoshu, why? The onus should be on you to defend your position, under the clear historical circumstances of the gay reality in this society. Do I really have to go over all of the societal changes I've discussed in previous posts? It's not a \"special interest\", but has had broader social implications. It's your special interest that wants to suppress knowledge with no rational justification.\n \n \nYou're not getting the problem here.\n You often portray these things as all-or-nothing, and that's rarely ever the case; this is no exception. NO ONE here is saying that gay pride is not a part of history.\n\n \n OK, now we're getting somewhere.\n \n \nThe issue is what parts of history is going to get class-time. Because frankly, there are waaaay more important events in history that you apparently think should get LESS attention than your pet issue. And that's your MORALITY coming through.\n\n \n No one's said that at all. Jyoshu, that IS your own strawman. We're not saying other events are less deserving of attention. \n \n \nI've asked this several times, and no one including you has answered it (yet you complain when OTHER people ignore questions): what is it about gay history that makes it more special than other things in history we don't have time to cover, either?\n\n \n Yes, I did answer that one. Perhaps you could narrow it down to what other things specifically you had in mind which haven't already been addressed. Just go ahead and pull anything out of your hat or from some other location, and we'll see what commonalities and differences there are. Now, we don't have to do this for any other people's history when it is taught. It makes for an endless distraction from the issue at hand, of gay history. It reminds me of the \"birthers\" wanting to see Obama's birth certificate and now even Donald Trump would like to see his grades in school. No other President would be asked to do this. Now, I'm sure it has nothing to do with the fact that Obama is the first black President. In this way, gays are also being put to a ridiculous standard by being expected to justify the teaching of gay history by addressing every fallacy you can come up with. \n \n \nFurthermore, it's fascinating that, when asked about WHY you all want gay history taught despite being such a tiny footnote of history,\n\n \n It's not a tiny footnote. You wouldn't be in these forums all the time, taking the anti-side. It shouldn't matter to you at all if there is equal access to marriage for gay couples for example. Were it such a tiny footnote, it couldn't take away time for other subjects as has been the false dilemma/fear tactic you've been arguing! Which is it, jyoshu? You're undercutting your own debate points!\n \n \nit's usually justified over MORALISTIC reasons, like helping people who might be gay to know it's normal or to help address (indirectly) the issue of gay bullying. So don't act like moralism isn't what this is about. It most certainly IS.\n\n \n I've referred to it as a \"spin-off\" benefit. So what? It doesn't mean there aren't good reasons to teach the history, even without that external consideration. There are such reasons, as have been discussed at length.\n \n \nSo we should also provide class time for Polish people since they were targeted far MORE in the holocaust than gays? See what I mean? Are you SURE you want to continue this like of thought? Because I don't think ya do. emoticon_xgood\n\n \n I don't believe they were targeted for being Polish, provided they had Aryan blood. Gays experiences in Nazi Germany are part of the historical record. It's not an either/or false dilemma, as I think you are trying to suggest it is.\n \n \nAgain, cut the XXXX. You keep arguing as if you're just benignly wanting history taught and that's all this has anything to do with. Nah, if it were just about history, you'd be pushing for OTHER MORE historic events to take the time you want covered.\n\n \n What other historical events which are currently not being covered? You're just creating a diversion from the topic at hand. This is really over-generalized BS artistry I'm sorry to say.\n \n \nThis is about your politics and ideology. You want gay pride in schools, and that's the bottom line.  Stop trying to avoid that reality.\n\n \n Because we don't want this knowledge kept out of schools, you indict us with wanting gays to have pride, as if that would be a bad thing in any conceivable way. No one has advocated specifically for that in their arguments as per this teaching of history, it seems to be your issue that gays not have pride. It makes people easier to keep in the closet and under control if they stay ignorant and shameful, no doubt. We can teach gay pride without teaching gay history. Would teaching African-American history lead to pride? What person would come out against that? \n \n \nAnd I'll simply repeat the obvious problem with that ...\n there are oodles of examples of more \"items\" out there that could be taking up time. Why add YOUR pet issue?\n\n \n Again, just a distraction from the issue at hand, with a ridiculous overly abstract strawman about the \"oodles\" allegedly out there. Perhaps some of the history you support being taught is someone else's pet issue? It doesn't matter, it's broad-brush strokes and subjective.\n \n \nNah, gay-related issues are much more intertwined with behavior and action than those examples. Furthermore, a person who refuses to engage in any same-sex behavior might as well (for all practical purposes) not be called gay. The same can't be said for skin color or gender.\n\n \n That's not true at all. Gay is an identity, whether or not one has any specific sexual actions. We're not talking about preaching the rightness or wrongness of sexual behaviours. Keep that in your church please. Teaching the social history of gays as people is something different. We can't help it if you can't get same-sex sex acts out of your mind. That's your problem, though. It's an impoverished reason to stop us from teaching history. \n \n \nSo you support anti-bullying initiatives being left out? You support gay-straight alliances being left out? Seriously?\n\n \n These exist outside the teaching of history in schools. It's a different thing. What do you mean?",

The ex-gay group is upset because the school system is not allowing them to hand out medically and psychologically inaccurate fliers that tell students that they can go from gay to straight.\n \n Richard Cohen was PFOX' intellectual guru and spokesperson for several years until a string of peculiar television appearances where he violently slammed a tennis racket against a pillow while screaming a parents' name, caressed clients who sat in his lap and showed he was manly by cursing and belching. After displaying the techniques promoted by PFOX on TV, the religious right was so mortified, they cut all ties to Cohen and threatened to denounce PFOX unless they banished their president.\n \n \"After watching Cohen' alarming display of lunacy on television, it would be grossly negligent and irresponsible for any school system to allow PFOX to hand out fliers to students,\" said Truth Wins Out' Executive Director Wayne Besen. \"If PFOX is given the green light, it opens the door to any nut or fringe group to distribute literature in the schools. Arlington is clearly acting within its right to protect students from utter madness and theories rejected as harmful by every respected mental health organization in the country.\"\n \n In Cohen' book, \"Coming Out Straight,\" he attributes homosexuality, in some cases, to ancestral curses and cites a book by Dr. Edith Fiore to back up his claim.\n \n \"Generally, the influencing spirits are seeking revenge, retaliating for wounds inflicted upon them,\" writes Cohen - who was kicked out of the American Counseling Association for malpractice - citing this passage in Fiore' book to justify his theory.\n\n Truth Wins Out - &#8220;EX-GAY&#8217; GROUP FILES LAWSUIT AGAINST ARLINGTON PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN ATTEMPT TO INTRODUCE BIZARRE IDEAS TO STUDENTS\n \n Anybody who doesn't acknowledge that ignorance of gays produces repeatedly new and bizarre examples on a persistent basis is just plain burying their head in the sand. emoticon_frazzled",

   "Pointing out the ignorance of others that you may not share is not a strawman argument.\n\n \n Yes it is when you do it INSTEAD of addressing the issues raised to you, which is what you do. No one here was talking about pedophiles or choice. Now are going to get back on topic or are you wanting to go chase other rabbits?\n \n \nAgain, LOOK UP the meaning of the term cause you clearly haven't grasped it...\n\n \n And once again Foundit accuses others of the very thing he has a problem with. Nothing new since his departure with his tail between his legs months ago.\n \n \nAnd again, this is about EDUCATION OF GAY HISTORY.\n\n \n And again, why does EDUCATION OF GAY HISTORY warrant attention over so many other issues that we force teachers to teach it? Your victims-of-the-holocaust reason fell short since there were much GREATER victimized groups in terms of numbers that we don't cover. What else ya got?\n \n \nYour FEAR that you want to propagate is that the issue will be \"homosexuality normalcy\", but that is NOT what the education curricula is. emoticon_xdonno\n\n \n That may not be what it \"IS\", but it's no doubt why it's being pushed and forced by you and your ilk. \n \n \nThis is part of the irrationality of the subject.\n People like you so afraid of education...\n\n \n And your statement demonstrates the REAL irrationality of the subject. People like you portray YOUR POLITICAL priorities as merely \"education\", when it's really your opinion of what should be EMPHASIZED. \n \n And I invite the viewing audience to notice Foundit's dishonest approach here.\n \n This is a typical ideologue's tactic: when someone argues against your opinion of how a given area should be conducted, you portray their view as being against the whole AREA in whole. Which of course, is completely dishonest on your part.\n We see the same tactic with other issues too:\n - people are accused of being anti-democracy if they oppose a certain WAY democracy is taking place\n - people are accused of being anti-women if they oppose the idea of women being being able to get partial-birth abortions\n - people are accused of being anti-gay if they believe gays should get benefits a DIFFERENT way than the gay pride movement demands.\n \n No, I am not \"afraid of education.\" I'm afraid of YOU (and your ilk) ideologically controlling education, for sure. As you've now demonstrated you are wanting to do by forcing teachers to teach your priorities. That's the concern. \n \n \nThere is a CLEAR difference inbetween a \"force\" of people being DISCRIMINATED against (THAT is an example of \"force\")...\n ... and an issue of a CURRICULA BEING CHOSEN.\n\n \n You don't think a teacher is being forced to teach something if the state says they have to teach it???? This is, after all, a moral/religious issue. Would you be so outraged as you are if people were opposing the state enforcing the history of the polygamy movement?? Or maybe Adultery in America 101?\n \n I suppose if a state forces a teacher to teach marxist ideology, you'd also say that's not an example of being forced, either. Apparently your case of discrimination is the only thing that can ever qualify as being an example of 'forcing.'\n \n \nThat is YOUR OPINION based on YOUR POLITICAL VIEWS.\n\n \n Dude ... emoticon_xdonno\n \n If we're going to start pointing THAT out for everything, you might as well expect to have every post to you include that. Because EVERYTHING could fall under that description. Your POLITICAL VIEWS about a certain pet issue being in education is WHY this discussion is taking place.\n \n \nBut it's not the one that California has gone with.\n\n \n Yep ... just like when YOUR opinion was that prop 8 shouldn't have happened, it was not the one that California has gone with EITHER. Or any other issue that's ever been discussed here by ANYONE. So now, you've pointed out the glaringly obvious that these are POLITICAL issues, care to actually DEBATE them? emoticon_rolleyes Sheesh.\n \n \nBut that DOES NOT detract the need for gay history to be taught based on clear examples of prolific ignorance.\n\n \n Again, you continue to miss the real issue here--that this particular example of \"ignorance\" warrants being forced in schools. There is any number of issues that school children would be 'ignonant' of, but that doesn't mean we need to enforce it into curricula in schools.\n \n \nIn short sweet-heart?\n Don't ask questions you don't want the answers to... \n\n \n ROTFLOL!! :p\n \"Answers\"? Foundit, you have yet to even give a REAL answer. \n How about ANY actual REAL answer on your part, Foundit? That would be actual progress for you. So far, it's only ideological tripe that doesn't address things you've been asked, by multiple posters.\n \n \nIf I heard a wide-scale demonstration that people didn't think Polish people were targeted in that way, I would happily see a need for that. Your reply seems to pretend that \"gays in the holocaust\" is the only issue at hand.\n But it clearly is not.\n It's one piece of a much large puzzle of ignorance. emoticon_xgood\n\n \n Dude, YOU used the holocaust example, not me. Having trouble following the thread here? Regardless, the movement that thinks gays weren't part of the holocaust has got to be so fringe, it doesn't warrant forcing teaching in a WHOLE STATE. Get real. I mean seriously--you guys act like every other person out there lines their living room with copies of the Pink Swastika .... emoticon_xdonno\n \n \nLook Jyoshu.\n You give quality discussion comments and I'll respond with quality.\n\n \n Actually, historically you've--frankly--rarely ever responded to ANYTHING with quality, Foundit. No matter WHAT kind of discussion was given to you. And so part of the problem I have when discussing with you is that it is very hard to take you seriously--if the day ever came that you dropped all your brow-beating, avoiding-issues antics and started actually dialoging with people, that could change.

   "One of the things about this that you obviously are REFUSING TO ADMIT is that this is not really a \"gay\" thing.\n It's HISTORY and FACTS, with the topic being \"gay history\".\n You keep trying to pretend gay \"history\" means gay \"morality\", but it doesn't.\n\n \n No, you keep calling it \"HISTORY\" and \"EDUCATION\", but what you really have is ideology about what of these you want EMPHASIZED. That's where your problem is. All events the human race has ever participated in, in the past are \"HISTORY.\" That doesn't mean they all warrant classroom attention.\n \n \nYou don't think that efforts to turn people from \"gay\" to \"straight\" are \"not anti-gay\"?\n X\n You claim their view is \"honest\", but PFOX talks about CHANGING gays to straight.\n The real zinger here is that YOU PERSONALLY try to make the focus ABSTINENCE.X Gays abstaining from gay sex.\n Well, PFOX goes WELL BEYOND just that into claiming they can CHANGE gays TO straight.\n THAT is where their dishonesty shines forth...\n X\n Another example of their dishonesty is from this claim: \"PFOX families love their homosexual child unconditionally.\"\n I challenge you to show me ANY PFOX member that fights for gay equality...\n X\n Furthermore, PFOX's web-site claiming they are fighting for \"ex-gay\" equality is just plain absurd.\n I can show you examples of legislation that ACTIVELY DISCRIMINATED against gays.\n Can anybody show me anything similar for \"ex-gays\"?\n Has the military ever forbidden an \"ex-gay\" from joining?\n Has any state ever forbidden an \"ex-gay\" from adopting?\n If an \"ex-gay\" wants to marry a partner, is there any discrimination?\n Ex-gays HAVE equality and it would be comical to see PFOX claim to fight for equality if it weren't for the fact that they think they are serious...\n\n \n Good grief. Can you please learn to condense your points?\n Anyway, \n \n - Support your claim of WHERE PFox is making efforts to turn people from \"gay\" to \"straight\". (I hope you aren't talking about the fact they support 'ex-gays'.) The very 1st line on their site says \"PFOX is not a therapeutic or counseling organization.\"\n \n - They talk about SUPPORTING those who are trying to change or live with being gay in a way that doesn't actively live out the orientation. They are not an organization that TRIES to make gays change into straight people. Support your claim that they are. There's nothing dishonest about saying one supports and group, and then supporting them. Again, where are they claiming they can CHANGE gay into straight? Are you going to back that up or is this going to be yet another one of your opinions that you try to pass off as gospel?\n \n - Your point about them needing to lobby for gay children in order to be able to claim unconditional love for gay children is just ridiculous. People don't have to take up a given person's fight and agenda in order to be able to say they love them.\n \n - PFOX did not claim they are fighting for ex-gay equality in terms of the LAW. Culturally, ex-gays are indeed constantly criticized by the gay pride movement and experience inequality in terms of the knowledge of their movement lack of political support.\n \n \nThe article described the contents.\n If you want to show us PFOX's claims on the flier, then go for it.\n Otherwise, the fact that they didn't scan in the document so you could download it is not evidence towards anything...\n\n \n Why would I need to back up assertions YOU linked to? That's your job.\n Which you aren't doing, I note. Of COURSE The \"article\" described the contents (as they want to portray it)--it's a op ed piece. Which is WHY we need to verify what it's claims are.",

   "That comment shows prejudice and a condescending attitude. \n\n I think it's not prejudice as it is well supported. The 'left' is a repeat offender in the most extreme degree when it comes to leveraging public education to produce future voters.\n \n Anthropogenic climate change, biological evolution as a complete theory of life, economic thinking which contradicts the basis of all economies, neo-Marxist political science etc.. it's all called science.\n \n There are three main reasons it is called science.\n \n 1. The religious right are well religious and 'taking on science' is a sore issue for them not to mention they aren't very scientific.\n \n 2. They get to say their side is rational, complete propaganda of course but it works on independents.\n \n 3. They get to teach it in schools, as fact.\n \n There is a common thread through them all. The cult of the anti man is the glue of the political left just like tradition is the glue of the political right. 'global warming' tells men their technology is inherently damaging to everyone and everything anyone cares about. A complete theory of life would be a great thing, as to why it's been pushed past it's actual level of development into 'all figured out' is to be used as a philosophical basis to subjectivism. i.e. morality, rights they are all products of evolution therefore nothing should stop us from ending them if it would benefit us. Also a non-sequitur but one that fools most. The economic thinking in which wasting wealth will create it calms people when neo-marxist philosophy (also taught) does just that. The neo-marxist political science presents to students a complex question in which the question of society and social contracts is 'what will best fulfill the needs of everyone in the society?'.\n \n There is nothing in the gay movement that will support the cult of the anti-man but because it is contradictory to the religious right many of the mid-level leftist thinkers who don't see the big picture will think that undermining christian radicals is an end in itself. They will pursue it as such, such people are not capable of being objective. I am not saying that all teachers or administrators would suffer as described but I know that a good chunk of public educators will and do.\n \n \nWho cares to hear your critique about how you allege we think? \n \n I didn't know you were a teacher, but if you don't fit the above criteria I was still not addressing what you think.\n \n \nThe persecution of gays, actually goes back to before those things, and continues through and afterward. It's not about the fraction of time, one area of history compared to another.\n\n Oh I know, but 5000 years ago was the first hard evidence that people were changing the way they thought; the first evidence that people were starting to fight the ancient ways of tribalism and emotionalism.\n \n \nI feel you're just trying to minimize and act condescending toward gays and our story, as you were at the outset of the post.\n\n Are you gay? I ask because I would like your opinion on the morality of homosexuality. How do you (if at all) defend it from the claim that it is immoral?",

They can be sexual without being with a family member, or in a marriage with one man and twelve wives.\n\n :p, yes they differ from incest in that they aren't incest and don't need to exist as such. Comparing two or three things is not declaring them identical. It seems in the other thread however pappalion tried to claim incest was fundamentally different from hetero and homo because there is no biological compulsion to be attracted to only family members, his point being that incest is typically the result of purely psychological factors. This I agree with but I must have missed the part where a non-physiological deviation is necessarily a mental illness on those grounds. It's like saying \"You would be a screwed up sick person... if you could help it\"\n \n \nI'd been avoiding that other thread on incest, as I believe it is off topic.\n\n It is. If you would like to discuss this I can start a dedicated thread?\n \n \nI'm not too familiar with the topic of incest. Now you've brought it here. Yikes. This is the diversionary route gay rights debates always go.\n\n I am sorry I did not intend to derail anything, I just want to discuss this matter with someone in a position of insight.\n \n I know you may not know much about incest, but as a homosexual you are likely to be better acquainted with medical and cultural aspects of homosexuality than either me or pappalion.\n \n To be quite frank though this is hardly a diversionary tactic in anyone's hands. If you start to establish the validity of one type of sexual deviation you are necessarily establishing traditionally novel standards by which to morally judge sexual behavior. You shouldn't be waiting for some bible thumper to start trying to apply the new standards everywhere they apply as a weapon against you, you should have done it when you established them.\n \n I am very curious about the standards involved, choice vs non-choice; biological vs psychological; consent vs natural.\n \n I would be lying if I said I haven't already come to a conclusion but I have not had a rigorous debate with anyone to test the soundness of said conclusion. The fact that homosexual defenders avoid this (to me) extremely pertinent comparative analysis like it was rat poison only peaks my interest all the more; I want to know why they do that.",

   "Meh. You're going to always look for some way to refuse any example I give you no matter what, because you aren't really considering them. It's not because of their 'identity' that gays aren't being allowed to call their hook-ups a marriage, in most states. My examples stand.\n\n \n Meh yourself. How has the place of obese people so drastically changed in society, compared to gay persons? The latter much more so. It's changed our definitions of human relationships, family and marriage. That's big. Equal marriage for same-sex couples is not about \"hooking up\". It's about a loving, committed relationship and part of the expression of a gay identity.\n \n \nMaybe gay validation is what you would want your kids' education to be about. I prefer my own kids' education to be about actually learning academics. Remember those? (math, science, reading, literature, etc.) Sorry, but 'gay American history' is a joke.\n\n \n No, your fallacious arguments are a joke. It's about teaching history or social studies. It isn't going to take time away from math. You keep saying gay history is nothing, and at the same time suggest the topic is so big it will take away from every other subject taught in school. You completely contradict your own nonsense.\n \n \nA lot of it is just people such as transvestites flaunting themselves in parades, riots at hook-up bars (\"stonewall\"), early ties to pederasty groups, etc. The very fact people call that legitimate 'American history' as if it's on part with George Washington and Lincoln is pretty sad.\n\n \n Here's a news flash, men who dress up as women are not just gay. Besides, I've seen PG-rated TV in the daytime which features men who dress in drag. This is just a diversion from the issue. You have no evidence that nothing which isn't age appropriate will be examined. You know, those gay bars like Stonewall represented one of the few ways gay people had to socialize in the early days. It wasn't necessarily about \"hooking up\". Gay bars even today perform some functions that straight singles bars do not. It's sometimes a treat(and safe!) to be in a majority environment when you're a minority in every other environment and have a difficult time meeting other gay people due to closets and a heterosexually-oriented world. Now, your mind is too focused on gay sex to realize this. That again is your own problem. There may have been some early ties to pederests. That's because gays were put out on the margins with other groups such as the mentally ill as well. I know your purpose in bringing that up is another fear tactic blown totally out of proportion and context. It's simply a diversion.\n \n \nIt's usually just people who's religion is more important to them than their sexuality, and so they choose not to follow gay pride's prescription for their life. In fact, likely for MOST people there are more important things than their sexuality. The important point here is that you are hypocritical for not supporting them.\n\n \n Look, if you could show a positive way that those who are gay discovered that the gay thing simply wasn't for them, that would be one argument. I'd accept that with my sincerest best wishes. However, everything I have seen from the \"ex-gays\", including what you have posted in this forum has been about using fear and ignorance to compel people to not be out or not have pride.

I have absolute freedom and control in my life and the only messes I have to clean up are my own and my child's. I make a good living. I have a vast network of friends and family all accross the globe. I have a friend with benefits. I own my own car and home. My son has an AMAZING adopted father and he and I have no complicated drama between the two of us so we can focus 100% on the parenting. What in the world would I need a husband around for?

Hurrah for whatever makes you happy (as long as its not at the expense of making someone else miserable). Just saying don't mistake me, I LOVE my life. \n \n Anyway, my rant wasn't about that - it was about children. Children are not legitimized by the construct into which they are born/raised.

   "Meh yourself. How has the place of obese people so drastically changed in society, compared to gay persons? The latter much more so. It's changed our definitions of human relationships, family and marriage. That's big. Equal marriage for same-sex couples is not about \"hooking up\". It's about a loving, committed relationship and part of the expression of a gay identity.\n\n \n Oh, no doubt the gay pride movement has coincided with the sexual revolution and therefore a sense of 'anything-goes' as far as relationships are concerned. So to that end, it has changed definition of human relationships by lowering standards. \"Equal marriage for gays\" certainly IS about legitimizing gay hook ups. \n \n \nNo, your fallacious arguments are a joke. It's about teaching history or social studies. It isn't going to take time away from math. You keep saying gay history is nothing, and at the same time suggest the topic is so big it will take away from every other subject taught in school. You completely contradict your own nonsense.\n\n \n If someone talks about the history of adultery in the U.S., it is indeed history. But is it worth teaching to school children when they could be learning legitimate academics? No. \"Gay history\" is the same way. I wouldn't want my children having to hear about hook-up bar riots, lewd parades, the drag queens, etc., any more than having to sit through a graphically-violent movie to learn that wars took place. Of course, likely these \"gay history\" \"courses\" will sugarcoat all that and pretend none of that happened. So it comes down to hearing TRUE history that is inappropriate for children, or hearing LIES and therefore not getting a real picture of \"gay history\". I prefer the former--not fooling with it. My kids won't have to worry about that. \n \n \nYou have no evidence that nothing which isn't age appropriate will be examined. \n\n \n Well, the onus is on you and them to guarantee you keep that stuff out of it, if you ever wanted to teach MY kids.\n \n \nYou know, those gay bars like Stonewall represented one of the few ways gay people had to socialize in the early days. It wasn't necessarily about \"hooking up\". \n\n \n Please. Why else would someone go to a gay bar? Don't be ridiculous. Regular socializing can be done anywhere.\n \n \nLook, if you could show a positive way that those who are gay discovered that the gay thing simply wasn't for them, that would be one argument. I'd accept that with my sincerest best wishes. However, everything I have seen from the \"ex-gays\", including what you have posted in this forum has been about using fear and ignorance to compel people to not be out or not have pride. That's a whole other animal.\n\n \n Then you haven't really looked into the movement, as is the case for most gay-priders. The real reason your movement hates them though is that they represent a threat to your prescription of gay peoples' lives that you demand.

The religion in their life seems to not just trump all other considerations, but it's also a source of negativity making them slaves to feelings of guilt and shame.\n\n The favourite weapon of collectivism is guilt. I know far too many examples of things which are not shameful today that were considered so in other times and cultures and vice versa. I know that most of the stuff that people feel shame for is subjective. I also know that pretty much no matter how high you estimate it you won't exceed how primary social pressure in sum effects fundamental beliefs. It is not shallow and purely conscious as many seem to think. That is why it is so important to teach philosophy, real philosophy I am not talking about those jokes which allege in the correct terminology the exact same thing; that every one's life belongs to society and the 'common wisdom' is the best and only standard of knowledge of all kinds, including morality.\n \n The idea that shame is being induced into gay people until the point where they are ready to pretty much forgo hope of sexuality is eminently probable in my opinion.\n \n What I find interesting but also a little absurd is the fact that before the revolution that same guilt which was induced by society was construed by psychologist as stemming from the inherent perversion of the desires, that debilitating self-loathing was a symptom of homosexuality itself. They used this belief to justify it being a mental disorder claiming it was inherently harmful. The circular reasoning is clear, and even though it no longer continues about homosexuality in professional circles it occurs in other circles still and persists about other deviations as well.\n \n \nThe ex-gays project their self-hatred by attacking the gay community. Ex-gays belittle gay people's relationships by saying it's just about sex and it cannot be anymore deeper or meaningful. In actual fact, this is how many ex-gays live out their sexuality, by secretive, shameful casual hook-ups which they can't let be anything more.\n\n Uh, it is just about sex. So is heterosexuality, hence the root. We know men love men and women love women already, even if they won't admit it that is what is going on for example if you are friends for 20 years and you respect and appreciate someone. The missing component for a sexual relationship is mutual lust ontop of mutual love. I think love and lust are connected in that love can create and strengthen lust if the attraction exists, and so people feel like their lust comes from their love and it does. It is still lust though.\n \n What would be very odd if homosexuality came with the inability to love both genders.",

I can't help it if you see gay sex everywhere, even where that isn't warranted. Harry Hay was just one voice, once speaking on one topic.

So no, the behaviors are not the same.\n \n \nIt's the gay movement that's more complex than you say. Gay pride occured before and after the sexual revolution. Gay issues are different issues, and were certainly not dependent on the sexual revolution, which was about heterosexuals. It's a bit like blaming gays for the high divorce rate, BEFORE gays were given the right to marry. Gay rights is it's own standard. It's not about a lack of modesty, but about equal rights.\n\n \n You're conflating gay rights with the gay pride movement--they aren't always the same thing. I am referring to the gay pride movement, specifically. That's where all the 'identity' and out-and-proud junk is. Gay rights is just a legal thing.\n \n Anyway, regarding your complaint about this being like \"blaming gays for the high divorce rate, BEFORE gays were given the right to marry\", you have to remember that gays have had the option of monogamy all along. It's not like they haven't had the ability to marry even if the state didn't recognize it. Fidelity has nothing to do with state recognition.\n \n You say the issues are different issue than civil rights, yet when you WANT, you prefer it compared to civil rights. On one hand you want it compared, on the other you want it pointed out that its different. This is hypocritical on your part.\n \n \nSeediness is everywhere my dear. Gays certainly didn't invent it. \n\n \n No, but why support another example of it?\n \n \nNo. I'm just responding to your fixation on sex.\n\n \n Dude, you're projecting. it doesn't go unnoticed that one of the favorite tactics of people like yourself is start accusing your critics of fixation with gay sex. The fact is, there's no way to have an honest and real conversation about gay-related issues without that being a part of it. \n \n \nDefending against their hated homosexuality is what's the big deal to \"ex-gays\", as they demonstrate in everything they do. Most people are indeed not like ex-gays. You'd never hear a happy straight guy say defensively \"my sexuality isn't everything to me\", when no one suggested that it was everything or a form of \"slavery\" in the first place. You'd never hear a straight guy say that about his heterosexuality, period. It's a defensive posture against one's acknowledged sexuality.\n\n \n But you ARE suggesting it is everything for gays, by the way you approach ex-gays. The very fact you don't accept them, indicates you expect sexuality to be everything for them. After all, that's how they're different from you. Religious people who have overcome gay behavior have found they DON'T have to be slaves to their sexuality, and so that pulls the rug out from under gay pride.\n \n \nSupposedly more important things like hating and defending against their homosexuality. That's their ex-gay identity. I hate their self-hate.\n\n \n You're projecting yourself into that again; a reason your movement hates them is that it turns out a person CAN live in a way that isn't gay-and-proud without self-hating. The artificial constructs you all have created (words like 'self-hating') is just BS and isn't the reality for everyone.",

   "The only way they could join that \"mainstream institution\" would be to have an opposite-sex marriage.\n\n \n Yeah, I figured that's what you had in mind after I posted. You're in support of ex-gay sham-marriages. Obviously this is the only way gays in your view could be mainstream and accepted, if we try to act like something we are not. You're not interested in seeing gays have true happiness with a spouse of our choice. It's all about the defense against who we are. It's a wedding ring, along with stuggle, pain, and suffering. \n \n \nChanging marriage to be anything-goes is to no longer make it mainstream.\n\n \n We're only talking about changing one aspect, and it's the one aspect you don't like because you are anti-gay unless it's miserable and trying to act straight.\n \n \nThe fact that it's a form of discrimination, regarding the benefits, is why I support CUs.\n\n \n Equality is about equal benefits and equal recognition, and truly equal choice.\n \n \n \nEr ... except one group has the highest HIV rates and monogamy is the exception much more so than the other. So no, the behaviors are not the same.\n\n \n You don't know that this is the reason. HIV did get a foothold in the gay community in the USA. Think about it. Gay men mostly have sex with other gay men. In the early days condoms were only used to prevent pregnancy. In other places like Sub-Saharan Africa, it affects mostly straight. \n \n Also, you can't have it both ways. Were you to wish more monogamy for gay men, you need to give equal social support to gay marriages. These promote monogamy, as marriage has with straight people. It lets people with honesty and truth live out their sexuality in that setting. \n \n \n \nYou're conflating gay rights with the gay pride movement--they aren't always the same thing. I am referring to the gay pride movement, specifically. That's where all the 'identity' and out-and-proud junk is. Gay rights is just a legal thing.\n\n \n You have to be out and proud to get your rights. Obviously you support neither. You support ex-gay hypocrisy and shame.\n \n \nAnyway, regarding your complaint about this being like \"blaming gays for the high divorce rate, BEFORE gays were given the right to marry\", you have to remember that gays have had the option of monogamy all along. It's not like they haven't had the ability to marry even if the state didn't recognize it. Fidelity has nothing to do with state recognition.\n\n \n Oh, hold on there! Social recognition and support go hand and hand with the state. The state and laws help to re-enforce the social part. Heterosexuals have always had both. Heterosexuals choose to legalize their marriages to help strengthen their marriage's power. Gays are not on the same playing field until the legalization of equal marriages for same-sex couples.\n \n \nYou say the issues are different issue than civil rights, yet when you WANT, you prefer it compared to civil rights. On one hand you want it compared, on the other you want it pointed out that its different. This is hypocritical on your part.\n\n \n I'm not sure where you are getting that. Could you explain in more detail?\n \n \nNo, but why support another example of it?\n\n \n Being gay isn't in itself, \"seedy\".\n \n \nDude, you're projecting. it doesn't go unnoticed that one of the favorite tactics of people like yourself is start accusing your critics of fixation with gay sex.\n\n \n You're the one who sees it everywhere. At the same time, you complain others focus on sexuality too much.\n \n \nThe fact is, there's no way to have an honest and real conversation about gay-related issues without that being a part of it.\n\n \n There most certainly is a way. I don't know and I don't care what straight, gay, or inter-racial married couples do or don't do in bed. I don't care if they are going out to meet friends without it having to be something to do with sex. \n \n \nBut you ARE suggesting it is everything for gays, by the way you approach ex-gays. The very fact you don't accept them, indicates you expect sexuality to be everything for them. After all, that's how they're different from you. Religious people who have overcome gay behavior have found they DON'T have to be slaves to their sexuality, and so that pulls the rug out from under gay pride.\n\n \n Okay, so they've chosen their religion. Why does there have to be a choice though? They are still struggling with the part of them that is gay, they haven't left that behind. You don't try to suppress that part of yourself because you like it. I'd say the religion is a negative force, if it makes their life more difficult, because it's demanding obedience despite the pain being caused. It focuses on appearances as well.",

The answer would still be \"no\", as above. Anyone can find someone else's sex acts not enticing. Perhaps that is the point they are trying to make. I don't think it ultimately gets us anywhere, in either case. It's also not interesting. \n \n \nHow about an aversion to overt campness?\n\n \n That's a complex and fascinating debate in itself. It goes to ideals of maleness in general in today's world. There are heterosexual men who may also not conform to everyone's ideal \"manly man\". I'd say it's homophobia if you're reacting to it because you feel it represents someone being gay. However, if you, as many gay men also believe, don't think a man has to sacrifice masculinity and traditional masculine interests, simply by virtue of being gay, then it's not homophobic. \n \n \nI think homophobia only becomes a bad thing when it involves harrassment/violence or discrimination against homosexuals.\n I can dislike whoever and whatever I like.\n\n \n It's prejudice if you say you dislike someone simply because he or she is gay.

   "If they say they are happy, then why do you care if a gay person marries a member of the opposite sex?\n\n \n You can't be happy married to a different sex person if you are gay.

How would you go about proving it? You can't.

Laws should reflect culture, not try to drive culture. Using law to drive culture is a form of tyranny.\n\n \n Wow. What do you mean by culture? Does that mean only having rights and freedoms if you meet a certain threshold of popularity? That's certainly not what American culture is about! At any rate, polling now shows the majority of Americans support equal marriage for same-sex couples.\n \n \nDude, that's just because marriage IS heterosexual by nature.\n\n \n Well, there's a new circular fallacy. Not! Marriage is a social and legal construct, and subject to change.\n \n \nThe categorization of people into boxes of 'straight' and 'gay' is an artificial construct--most people aren't gay and don't give a rip about sexuality. You're just too hung up on this. When people say the word 'married', they typically mean a man and a woman together.\n\n \n People care enough to deny same-sex couples marriage, recognizing differences in others when they discriminate. This is a very weak argument on you part. You're saying gay people should just remain silent on wanting to be equal, and there will be no problem. The majority can continue to discriminate. BS.\n \n \nYou want gay rights to be significant enough to be its own issue, but on the other hand you want it to be comparable to civil rights. you can't have it both ways.\n\n \n Wow. That's really grasping at straws.\n \n \nNo, I didn't say it was. I was talking about the behavior, not the \"being\".\n\n \n Behaviour, as in what, sex acts? That's your hang-up again. Most people couldn't care less what the married couple next door, gay or straight, is doing in bed. \n \n \nBecause that's their religion. You're going to have to live with the fact that your way of living isn't moral in the eyes of a lot of people.

It was the culmination of the philosophical forces that began work 200 years before.\n \n The age of reason formed the united states, the 'counter-revolution' in Europe formed Nazi Germany and the soviet union.\n \n The nazi - communist struggle was to solve a fundamental problem in collectivism. The collective is all the individual is nothing they agreed but what embodies the collective? What defines the collective? Nazis said it was race and leader, communist said it was class and state (meaning a bureaucracy vs a despot). It has massive philosophical import, no one who understood what happened could ever think about collectivism in any form without a slight churning in their stomach.\n \n There is no such thing as too little study for WWII, everything that caused it; everyone in it. If I were to pick out only 5 events in all human history to cover in a history topic this would be in the top three.\n \n In WWII you not only are able to observe the most distilled evil in history, you are able to know why it was done. In contrast to this evil the allied forces seemed all the better. Gay rights are merely a subset of rights and that is how they should be thought of. How can you speak of on the whole peaceful demonstrations not against evil incarnate but for the most part slow bureaucratic government machines, biased psychologist, and ignorant people in the same breath with a global struggle for the fundamental nature of rights. There would be no gay rights under a swastika, there would be no rights; and more likely than not no gays or blacks to have a civil rights movement about.\n \n ... Anyway what I am trying to say is that WWII is 'more changing' than civil rights movements.",

Here's the scary part: Jefferson was considered a liberal. At the time, the most common penalty on the books was death.\"\n A Short History of Gay Rights in America\n \n Yes, I'd say there's been a big change to the issue of liberty in the U.S., as it concerns gays. \nAs big as civil rights? No. Again, it's almost insulting to think otherwise. \n \n \nSome people may see civil rights as more changing than WW2, depending on your perspective.\n Ok, and they would be wrong. Luckily both are big enough to include in text books. \n \n \nYou obviously have a negative perspective on any importance being placed on gay rights, despite those very good points of foundit's, concerning all the time spent fighting something that is at the same time said by opponents to be trivial.\nShould we go back in history and see \"causes\" that are not included in the US history textbook? Yes, I have a negative perspective on any importance being placed on gay rights because it is ridiculous to think this \"cause\" is so world changing that it needs to be placed in history books. It is hard for people who strongly believe in a cause to see clearly that their goal, while possibly noble and good, is not that important in the grand scheme of things. Sorry that I'm the one the place that harsh reality on the table. \n \n You have like 9 months to teach kids 300+ years of US history (depending on where they start) and when the choices have to be made about what is included and you maybe have 1-2 days to cover 20-30 years of history that we should spend time on gay rights over anything else? Come on...this is absurd. \n \n \nYou raised the issue of social justice. Who is against social justice??!! This is not a core value of America, or are you just saying it shouldn't apply to gays?\nNo, I didn't raise the issue of social justice. Pay attention to what I'm quoting please.",

   "Do gay people have a history? Is there a place in this Country for us amongst the texts of history? Certainly. \nAnd we have just the thing for this; books. If you want to write a book about gay history and put it in the library or in Kindle format than I'm fine with that. The question is why does this rise to the level of importance to teach in a history class that has limited time. Perhaps many of you don't know how limited the time actually is. Schools are normally like 180 days and US history is taught once in most high schools. Generally speaking classes are 90 minutes every other day. That's about 135 hours to teach 300+ years of history. Obviously you minus some days for tests and other administrative activities. When you boil it down you cover decades during one class period. Now think over the past 30 years of US history. Excluding your own personal crusade what are the most important things that happened in the last 30 years of US history. If you're lucky you may be able to teach 4 or 5 of them.

I'll answer my own question for you...\n Throughout the history of discrimination, there exists examples of \"scorched earth\" whereby the people who are prejudiced against a thing would rather see a thing destroyed than allow another group equal access to that thing.\n \n One example is school clubs. If the school has to allow a gay/straight alliance, some of the school membership would rather ELIMINATE ALL school clubs rather than allow that gay/straight alliance.\n \n Now, WERE clubs a problem before the gay/straight alliance? No.\n ARE marriages a problem before gay marriage? Judging by the lack of discussion, no.\n But ONLY AFTER equality is sought do you see people trying to cripple or destroy the venue...\n \n So, the whole \"gays are the only ones demanding the rights\" is kind of Freudian, in that you are essentially ADMITTING that it's gays that are your concern and NOT THE ONGOING ASPECTS OF EXISTING legislated marriage.\n \n \n \nBecause gays are the only ones demanding the rights, I argue against them in the abstract every time I make my case for a purely volitional society which contains no positive rights.\n\n And you wonder why people see you as anti-gay...\n \n White person wants to use the drinking fountain?

Yet, they obviously can get beyond that and see gays as full human persons in need of many human rights which would have been considered unthinkable in past history. Gays were thought not to have any rights at all, because the same argument of the wrongness of a sex act was employed. So why not get over it completely already!",

   "Here's another: Alan Turing\n \n \nAlan Mathison Turing, OBE, FRS ... was an English mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst and computer scientist. He was highly influential in the development of computer science, providing a formalization of the concepts of \"algorithm\" and \"computation\" with the Turing machine, which played a significant role in the creation of the modern computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of computer science and artificial intelligence.\n \n During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre. For a time he was head of Hut 8, the section responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. He devised a number of techniques for breaking German ciphers, including the method of the bombe, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. After the war he worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he created one of the first designs for a stored-program computer, the ACE.\nSo much for why he might be mentioned in a high school history class. But that much is only part of the story. To leave out the rest...\nTuring's homosexuality resulted in a criminal prosecution in 1952, when homosexual acts were still illegal in the United Kingdom. He accepted treatment with female hormones (chemical castration) as an alternative to prison. He died in 1954, several weeks before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined it was suicide; his mother and some others believed his death was accidental. On 10 September 2009, following an Internet campaign, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology on behalf of the British government for the way in which Turing was treated after the war.\n... would be to omit a no less significant aspect of it, a \"teaching moment\" in its own right, and would be a disservice to both the man and his legacy.",

That's simply a reaction based on ignorance fear and prejudice.\n\n Your right, but that's also a fact. This issue is forcing people to teach it not the factual matter at hand.\n \n I for instance believe all taxation is wrong, believe the very premise for most social programs is unsound. If I tried to force people to teach that there would be a good deal of outcry from ignorant people who in truth just don't know any better (very few are actively evil enough to support what is happening after they realize it).\n \n Their rejection is merely a fact, as is it a fact they are dead wrong. I can't argue they are dead wrong to force 'my view' to be taught in schools. No one would accept that and you know it.\n \n It is not a matter of just teaching history, for that supports me as well; but if the correct events are omitted and other events overemphasized, their facts twisted one can be left with the impression of the complete opposite. Take for instance communism in which they literally believed all history was a cycle of class warfare.\n \n It's not an argument against gay history it's an argument against mandating something be taught. As I said before it all reeks with a little pointlessness though because since we are talking about public schools they are inherently subject to government mandates.\n \n \nI didn't say he personally believes this.
