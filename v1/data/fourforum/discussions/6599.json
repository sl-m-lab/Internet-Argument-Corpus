   "...I will apply dietetic measures for the benefit of the sick according to my ability and judgment; I will keep them from harm and injustice.\n \n I will neither give a deadly drug to anybody who asked for it, nor will I make a suggestion to this effect. Similarly I will not give to a woman an abortive remedy. In purity and holiness I will guard my life and my art.\n \n I will not use the knife, not even on sufferers from stone, but will withdraw in favor of such men as are engaged in this work....\"Hippocratic Oath\"\n\n It seems kind of funny to me that a man who lived that long ago, while setting out ethical standards for doctors, included abortion, but so many people today fail to see this as ethically wrong. It seems strange to me that anyone would want to go to a doctor who would just blow off part of his creed. What other parts is he blowing off? Maybe he's a doctor who'll just forget about the part about \"not prescribing deadly drugs\" too, because I guess it doesn't really matter. It even states at the end: \nIf I keep this oath faithfully, may I enjoy my life and practice my art, respected by all men and in all times; but if I swerve from it or violate it, may the reverse be my lot\n Why are they able to get away with this without any repercussions?",
