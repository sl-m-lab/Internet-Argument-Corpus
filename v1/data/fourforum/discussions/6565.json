   "October 05, 2005\n Catholic Church no longer swears by truth of the Bible\n By Ruth Gledhill, Religion Correspondent\n \n THE hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church has published a teaching document instructing the faithful that some parts of the Bible are not actually true.\n \n The Catholic bishops of England, Wales and Scotland are warning their five million worshippers, as well as any others drawn to the study of scripture, that they should not expect \"total accuracy\" from the Bible.\n \n \"We should not expect to find in Scripture full scientific accuracy or complete historical precision,\" they say in The Gift of Scripture.\n \n The document is timely, coming as it does amid the rise of the religious Right, in particular in the US.\n \n Some Christians want a literal interpretation of the story of creation, as told in Genesis, taught alongside Darwin's theory of evolution in schools, believing \"intelligent design\" to be an equally plausible theory of how the world began.\n \n But the first 11 chapters of Genesis, in which two different and at times conflicting stories of creation are told, are among those that this country's Catholic bishops insist cannot be \"historical\". At most, they say, they may contain \"historical traces\".\n \n The document shows how far the Catholic Church has come since the 17th century, when Galileo was condemned as a heretic for flouting a near-universal belief in the divine inspiration of the Bible by advocating the Copernican view of the solar system. Only a century ago, Pope Pius X condemned Modernist Catholic scholars who adapted historical-critical methods of analysing ancient literature to the Bible.\n \n In the document, the bishops acknowledge their debt to biblical scholars. They say the Bible must be approached in the knowledge that it is \"God's word expressed in human language\" and that proper acknowledgement should be given both to the word of God and its human dimensions.\n \n They say the Church must offer the gospel in ways \"appropriate to changing times, intelligible and attractive to our contemporaries\".\n \n The Bible is true in passages relating to human salvation, they say, but continue: \"We should not expect total accuracy from the Bible in other, secular matters.\"\n \n They go on to condemn fundamentalism for its \"intransigent intolerance\" and to warn of \"significant dangers\" involved in a fundamentalist approach.\n \n \"Such an approach is dangerous, for example, when people of one nation or group see in the Bible a mandate for their own superiority, and even consider themselves permitted by the Bible to use violence against others.\"\n \n Of the notorious anti-Jewish curse in Matthew 27:25, \"His blood be on us and on our children\", a passage used to justify centuries of anti-Semitism, the bishops say these and other words must never be used again as a pretext to treat Jewish people with contempt. Describing this passage as an example of dramatic exaggeration, the bishops say they have had \"tragic consequences\" in encouraging hatred and persecution. \"The attitudes and language of first-century quarrels between Jews and Jewish Christians should never again be emulated in relations between Jews and Christians.\"\n \n As examples of passages not to be taken literally, the bishops cite the early chapters of Genesis, comparing them with early creation legends from other cultures, especially from the ancient East. The bishops say it is clear that the primary purpose of these chapters was to provide religious teaching and that they could not be described as historical writing.\n \n Similarly, they refute the apocalyptic prophecies of Revelation, the last book of the Christian Bible, in which the writer describes the work of the risen Jesus, the death of the Beast and the wedding feast of Christ the Lamb.\n \n The bishops say: \"Such symbolic language must be respected for what it is, and is not to be interpreted literally. We should not expect to discover in this book details about the end of the world, about how many will be saved and about when the end will come.\"\n \n In their foreword to the teaching document, the two most senior Catholics of the land, Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, Archbishop of Westminster, and Cardinal Keith O'Brien, Archbishop of St Andrew's and Edinburgh, explain its context.\n \n Corrected Link",

   "October 05, 2005\n Catholic Church no longer swears by truth of the Bible\n By Ruth Gledhill, Religion Correspondent\n \n THE hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church has published a teaching document instructing the faithful that some parts of the Bible are not actually true.\n\n The title of the article is a blatant falsehood. The reporter's first statement of the article is an erroneous interpretation of the bishops' document. She is misunderstanding or misconstruing. \n \n I can't find the document, The Gift of Scripture, online to read it fully but on the website of the Conference of Bishops of England and Wales it tells us that The Gift of Scripture  is based on the Vatican II document, Dei Verbum. Here is what Dei Verbum  says about the truth of scripture: \n \n \nCHAPTER III\n SACRED SCRIPTURE, ITS INSPIRATION AND DIVINE INTERPRETATION \n \n 11. Those divinely revealed realities which are contained and presented in Sacred Scripture have been committed to writing under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. For holy mother Church, relying on the belief of the Apostles (see John 20:31; 2 Tim. 3:16; 2 Peter 1:19-20, 3:15-16), holds that the books of both the Old and New Testaments in their entirety, with all their parts, are sacred and canonical because written under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, they have God as their author and have been handed on as such to the Church herself.(1) In composing the sacred books, God chose men and while employed by Him (2) they made use of their powers and abilities, so that with Him acting in them and through them, (3) they, as true authors, consigned to writing everything and only those things which He wanted. (4)\n \n Therefore, since everything asserted by the inspired authors or sacred writers must be held to be asserted by the Holy Spirit, it follows that the books of Scripture must be acknowledged as teaching solidly, faithfully and without error  that truth which God wanted put into sacred writings (5) for the sake of salvation. Therefore \"all Scripture is divinely inspired and has its use for teaching the truth and refuting error, for reformation of manners and discipline in right living, so that the man who belongs to God may be efficient and equipped for good work of every kind\" (2 Tim. 3:16-17, Greek text).\n \n 12. However, since God speaks in Sacred Scripture through men in human fashion, (6) the interpreter of Sacred Scripture, in order to see clearly what God wanted to communicate to us, should carefully investigate what meaning the sacred writers really intended, and what God wanted to manifest by means of their words.\n \n To search out the intention of the sacred writers, attention should be given, among other things, to \"literary forms.\" For truth is set forth and expressed differently in texts which are variously historical, prophetic, poetic, or of other forms of discourse. The interpreter must investigate what meaning the sacred writer intended to express and actually expressed in particular circumstances by using contemporary literary forms in accordance with the situation of his own time and culture. (7) For the correct understanding of what the sacred author wanted to assert, due attention must be paid to the customary and characteristic styles of feeling, speaking and narrating which prevailed at the time of the sacred writer, and to the patterns men normally employed at that period in their everyday dealings with one another. (8)\n \n But, since Holy Scripture must be read and interpreted in the sacred spirit in which it was written, (9) no less serious attention must be given to the content and unity of the whole of Scripture if the meaning of the sacred texts is to be correctly worked out. The living tradition of the whole Church must be taken into account along with the harmony which exists between elements of the faith. It is the task of exegetes to work according to these rules toward a better understanding and explanation of the meaning of Sacred Scripture, so that through preparatory study the judgment of the Church may mature. For all of what has been said about the way of interpreting Scripture is subject finally to the judgment of the Church, which carries out the divine commission and ministry of guarding and interpreting the word of God. (10)\n \n 13. In Sacred Scripture, therefore, while the truth and holiness of God always remains intact, the marvelous \"condescension\" of eternal wisdom is clearly shown, \"that we may learn the gentle kindness of God, which words cannot express, and how far He has gone in adapting His language with thoughtful concern for our weak human nature.\" (11) For the words of God, expressed in human language, have been made like human discourse, just as the word of the eternal Father, when He took to Himself the flesh of human weakness, was in every way made like men.\n (emphasis mine)\n \n Dei Verbum can be found here for anyone who wants to read it in its entirety:\n \n http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651118_dei-verbum_en.html \n \n It is more likely that the Bishops are saying in The Gift of Scripture  what the Church has already stated in Dei Verbum--that one must be aware of different literary forms when reading the Bible. Some of it is literal but not all of it. Our understanding of the Bible has developed over time although the truth and message of the Bible has never changed.\n \n For anyone who wants to look at this further, the website of the Bishops of Wales and England is here:\n \n http://www.catholicchurch.org.uk/liturgy/index.html \n \n The article mentioned in the 1st post is here since that link doesn't work:\n \n http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,13509-1811332,00.html",
