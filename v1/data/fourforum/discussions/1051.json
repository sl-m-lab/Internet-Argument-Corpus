   "Epaphras_Faith,\n \n \n I know its a bit long but I've spent quite a time collecting information and forming this paper of sorts. Due to the recent change in the character limit to 50,000 I've been able to compress this into one post.\n \n \n On September 11, 2003 the Israeli Security Cabinet made an announcement regarding terrorism, Yasser Arafat and the security fence. Here is a part of that statement issued by the Cabinet:\n \"Events of recent days have reiterated and proven again that Yasser Arafat is a complete obstacle to any process of reconciliation between Israel and the Palestinians. \n \"Israel will work to remove this obstacle in a manner, and at a time, of its choosing. Israel is not interested in the question of the identity of the Palestinian Prime Minister; however, Israel must underscore its position that it will negotiate only with a Prime Minister who acts immediately to dismantle and remove the terrorist organizations, implements and carries out full reforms of the Palestinian Authority, and fully upholds the other commitments that the Palestinian Authority has taken upon itself according to the roadmap, as it has been adopted by the Israeli government. \n The statement calls \"Yasser Arafat\" an obstacle to peace that \"Israel will work to remove\". On September 14, 2003 Israel's vice prime minister said that killing Arafat was an option. He said in an interview with CNN: \n \"How many more civilians must be killed ... before someone will come and say, 'Hey, let's stop the man who has been responsible for all of this?' \"\n Countries such as the US called for restraint: \n The Bush administration -- concerned the expulsion of Arafat would crush efforts to make peace in the Middle East -- is pressuring Israel not to expel him, State Department officials said. \"We worry this would blow up wide open,\" one official said. \"It would have serious repercussions, not only in the Palestinian territories, but also throughout the region and with efforts to make peace.\" The U.S. officials said Secretary of State Colin Powell worked the phones Friday, speaking with Israeli, Palestinian and Arab foreign ministers. \n Although on September 15, 2003 the US vetoed a UN Security Council resolution to order Israel to halt all threats including expulsion to Arafat. On September 19, 2003 the UN passed a resolution through the UN general assembly where the US has no authority to veto. \n \n Biography \n \n \n \n Yasser Arafat's birthplace and day are disputed. A birth certificate shows the date of his birth as August 24, 1929 in Cairo Egypt although Arafat and many supporters claim he was born August 4, 1929 in Jerusalem. He was one of seven children in a wealthy family. His mother died when he was five years old. He was sent by his father with his uncle. Arafat does not speak much about his childhood but claims one of his earliest memories was of British soldiers breaking into his uncle's house and beating members of the family. This of course was when the area was under British authority. He graduated at Cairo University with a civil engineering degree. During his time in Cairo before he was seventeen years old Arafat was smuggling arms to Palestine to be used against the British and the Jews. When he was nineteen years old during the war between the Jews and the Arab states he left his studies to fight against the Jews in the Gaza area. The Arab states were defeated and led left an established state of Israel. In 1958 he founded Al-Fatah, an underground network which began to publish a magazine advocating armed struggle against Israel. At the end of 1964 he became a full time revolutionary organizing Fatah raids into Israel from Jordan. It was also around this time that he established the PLO (Palestinian Liberation Organization) The Fatah was one of many groups within the PLO which eventually came to dominate it. Arafat was named chairman of the PLO replaced Ahmed Shukairy, who was actually originally appointed by the Arab League. \n Arafat relocated the PLO from Jordan to Lebanon. The PLO was able to operate very easily within a weak central government. It used this area to launch artillery and terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians. (Such as the Maalot High School Massacre of 1974)\n The PLO is responsible for many terrorist attacks including the kidnapping of eleven Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympic Games which let to all athletes being killed. When this occurred it received world condemnation. Arafat attempted to publicly dissociate himself from the group slowly. Although the attacks continued all throughout the late 1970's. The PLO was accepted to full membership to the Arab League in 1976. Even though it was a widely known organization responsible for multiple terrorist attacks against Israel. \n After a major blow to the PLO from a series of Israeli attacks Arafat received assistance from Saddam Hussein. (Saddam Hussein before his defeat in the 2nd gulf war was known for paying off suicide bombers.)\n On December 13, 1988 to the UN, Arafat said he declared acceptance of the UN Security Council Resolution 242, and renounced terrorism.\n ON January 20, 1996 Arafat was elected president of the PA (Palestinian Authority) with an 87% majority. The PA has become to be known as the true official government even thought it functions more as a one person rule.\n There was only one other candidate running against Arafat. Many claim this election to be a fabricated form of democracy for a show. There has been no election since. \n Arafat's financial wealth has been reported in a business magazine as \"at least 300 million\"\n \n \n Thank you for reading a short biography on Arafat. I chose to type out my own version of it because simply giving you a link wouldn't be fair and I made it shorter and easier read by not including the unnecessary information.\n \n The case against Arafat \n \n \n 1. Terrorism  \n \n \n \n All throughout Arafat life he has been involved in an armed struggle against Israel. From smuggling arms, to forming terrorist organizations, and funding attacks against Israeli civilians. He obviously has no real true regard for human life perhaps because he believes what he does is truly justified. \n The organizations responsible for the slaughtering of innocent Israeli civilians include: Hamas, Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, Hizballah, Palestinian Liberation Front (PLF), and Islamic Jihad which is a right wing faction of Arafat's Fatah movement. \n During interviews with American media (CNN, Fox) masked members of the terrorist group Hamas and Islamic Jihad, have claimed full loyalty to Arafat. Spokesman for the groups often publicly support him. \n How is he terrorist or how does he harbor terrorism?\n On May 6, 2002 the Israeli government released a report. The report contained the following points:\n A. The Palestinian security forces (numbering 40,000 or so) have not been ordered to act against militant groups. These groups remain under Arafat's strict control.\n B. Yasser Arafat allows Palestinians wanted by Israel to take refuge inside his compound.\n C. During last years siege of Arafat's compound the IDF (Israeli Defense Force) found letters he has signed authorizing payments to activists such as members of the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade. The various groups are responsible for suicide bombings which have rocked the Middle East into a spur of violence.\n D. In January 2002 a ship, the Karine A, was seized by Israel. It contained over 50 tons of armaments. The shipment was valued at millions of dollars which would have never taken place without Arafat's involvement. He denies any involvement but the US has rejected his version of events and cut ties to him. \n \n Arafat is commonly quoted as saying word of hate and violence. Arafat: \"But we ask Allah to grant us martyrdom, to grant us martyrdom. To Jerusalem we march - martyrs by the millions.\"\n What man of peace speaks those kinds of words? These are not kind from a horrible leader. \n \n 2. A poor leader \n \n \n A. While Arafat by a report has at least 300 million dollars in various accounts somehow 80% of Palestinians live below the poverty line. How is it that such a great leader caring for his people with unspeakable wealth can not afford a few million of aid to his troubled starving people? \n B. The US and Israel recently applied political pressure to the Palestinians to come up with a new leader to negotiate with Israel. Abu Mazen was handpicked by Arafat (the terrorist) and you now have a terrorist's puppet and a shared for the road map created. Abbas resigned due in part to a power struggle with Yasser Arafat. Arafat never did render control of his security forces to Mr. Mazen. They both also failed in dismantling terrorist groups despite Mazen's promise to do so. \n C. Arafat has also constantly be critised for not signing the agreement so closely reached at Camp David with President Bill Clinton. Arafat was offered 97% (or maybe it was 98%) of the land requested in return for peace. While the refugee issues are commonly used as a defense of Arafat's blunt refusal he also never offered a counter offer. It is not the land that Arafat wants. It is the destruction of Israel. \n D. If Arafat truly wanted the best for his people why doesn't he simply resign? The Bush administration refuses to deal with him. The Israeli government refuses to deal with him. If he truly wanted peace to be more likely between the two parties he would resign from all political positions within the conflict.\n E. Even now in the spotlight of the world Arafat with the full capability to do so does nothing to dismantle terrorist groups. If he needed aid to do so (which he doesn't) there are plenty of countries willing to help this happen. (Two of them being the US and Israel). So why does he not take steps to dismantle terrorist organizations? (Because he supports, harbors, and funds them). \n \n In ten years since Oslo, since Israel made a pact with the PLO... over 1,122 Israelis have been murdered and thousands have been maimed for life. In proportion to the population of American terms 1,122 murdered means 56,100 dead. Would the US stand or any other country ever stand for such terror and use all the restrain that Israel does? While you can claim they use little or no restraint they do.\n Israel is in possession of the capability to absolutely obliterate all of the PA, PLO, etc... If Israel used the kind of \"restraint\" the US does, Israel would be occupying a country such as Egypt or Saudi Arabia which also helps to fund terrorism in Israel. \n \n In Conclusion \n \n \n \n Yasser Arafat is to be considered a terrorist. He funds, supports and harbors terrorism. As the current leader of the Palestinian people he has obligations to the world, to his people and to the peace process which so many people desire.\n Mr. Arafat is equal to that of Osama Bin Laden. While not actually taking part in the attacks on Israeli civilians he serves similar functions. They have both been a supporter of attacks on innocent civilians for years. \n So why should Osama Bin Laden be forced to hide in caves while Arafat is protected by the United Nations?\n Neither of them deserves any political power whatsoever. The US has the right to eliminate Osama Bin Laden because of the American deaths he is responsible for. Just as Israel has a right to eliminate Arafat because of the Israeli deaths he is responsible for. \n Whether Arafat is removed by expulsion, arrest and trial, or assassination, he should be removed because he clearly does not desire peace and in doing so he is an obstacle to peace.\n \n Sources:\n http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/09/13/world/main573124.shtml\n http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/09/26/mideast/index.html\n http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/09/11/cabinet.communique/index.html\n http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/09/14/mideast/index.html\n http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/09/19/arafat.un/index.html\n http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/09/12/mideast.arafat/index.html\n http://www.terrorvictims.com/terroristgroups.htm\n http://www.wsfi.net/Documents/YASSER%20ARAFAT%20BIOGRAPHY.HTM\n http://www.msnbc.com/news/801833.asp?0cv=CB10\n http://search.biography.com/print_record.pl?id=3931\n http://www.thepeacemission.com/yasser-arafat.htm\n http://www.nobel.se/peace/laureates/1994/arafat-bio.html\n http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/20/international/middleeast/20MIDE.html?ex=1064894400&en=aa896e6ce148c854&ei=5070\n \n \n \n --- END POST #1---\n \n P.S.

   "The argument:\n \n SilentPoet will be arguing that Israel should remove Arafat from power by means of Assassination, Expulsion, and or Arrest (With trial pending)\n \n Epaphras_faith will be arguing that Israel should not remove Arafat from power by means of Assassination, Expulsion, and or Arrest (With trial pending).\n \n I want to be clear that Israel should not remove Yassar Arafat from power by means of assasination, expulsion, and/or arrest (with trial pending).\n \n Contention I: Arafat still has popular support. \n A. The Arab and Islamic community\n While Arafat is not necessarily liked he is supported throughout the arab and islamic world. Fox news reports from foreignpolicy.com that \"But no Arab leader is prepared to challenge him. All acknowledge him as the symbol of the Palestinian movement, and no one sees an alternative to him. \" \n \n No one is willing to go out on a limb for him but he is still consider the symbol of the palestinian movement.\n \n B. The United Nations\n 1. The UN passed a resolution 133-4 with 15 abstentions condemning Israel's intent to remove Yassar Arafat. \n \n Arafat is currently recognized by the world at large as the correct leader of the palestinian people. Kofi Anan has repeatedly slammed Israel in the press for their attacks on various terrorists and their camps, most recently in Syria. \n \n Contention II: Israel is not well liked in the region. A great deal of biased exists. They are surrounded by muslim countires. A move of the magnitude proposed by Israel would only anger and enrage the situation. \n A. Secretary of State Colin Powel said in an interview with Tony Snow of Fox News that, \n SNOW: Secretary Powell, Israel has defined Yasser Arafat as an obstacle to peace and has advocated his removal. What specifically would be the negative consequences of exiling Yasser Arafat? \n POWELL: The United States does not support either the elimination of him or the exile of Mr. Arafat. It's not our position, hasn't been. The Israeli government knows it. \n And I think the consequences would not be good ones. I think you can anticipate that there would be rage throughout the Arab world, the Muslim world, and in many other parts of the world. And I don't see how, at this delicate moment, that would serve the cause of moving forward on the road map. \n \n His point is clear. The roadmap to peace is the UN agreed upon process. To abandon it at this point would likely only incur harm and not solve the problem. The US attack in Iraq is already viewed as a support of \"zionism.\" The region is clearly unstable. Israel's removal of arafat is only more likely to destablize the region. While this was said about the US attack on Iraq, it is not the same situation. 1) The attack on Iraq has already occurred and there is some regional unrest. Particularly on the part of Syria and Iran. 2) The US had many current UN resolutions that gave it the right to conduct such an operation. No such resolution currently exists in Israel\n B.The UN has repeatedly not supported Israel's actions on its own behalf in attacking palestinians. Resolutions, many vetoed by the US, have been brought condemning Israel without condemning the palestinians for their part. While this is wrong it none-the-less depicts the bias in the world community.\n \n Now to my opponents case.\n \n As to all contentions, Generally, I have no argument. They however do not support the topic completely. The topic is clear that Silent Poet supports ISRAEL'S removal of Arafat.\n \n 1) For Israel to remove Arafat would only increase the conflict they currently receive. As stated in my contentions, there is a bias against Israel and for the Palestinians. There also exists the conscept that the region currently supports Arafat and would likely view any move against him by Israel as so far out of line as to actually spark a regional war. Pakistan is known to have nuclear weapons. Saudi Arabia is highly critical of israel, Egypt, Iran, Syria, etc. Israel, likewise is likely in possession of proscribed weapons. An allegation that has never actually been investigated by the UN.\n \n 2) The united States does not support Israel's removal of Arafat. While the US agrees that Arafat';s decrease in power is absolutely necessaary, the US believes that it can be accomplished through means that keeps Israel out of it. Colin Powel's comments confirm this.\n \n 3) There is no denying Israel's right to protect itself. Israel has the right to remove Arafat for reason's of national security. It is not always in the best interest of a person (or country) to exercise their rights. While they have the right ot do that, they also have the right not to. Israel has an opportunity to take the higher ground. To remove Arafat is illogical as it will only foment violence. To remove Arafat is illogical, because he is a poor leader. If I were in competition with another chess player for the championship. I would be more comfortable knowing he was a poor player. The appropriate thing to do in Israel's case would be to work to show the palestinian people what a poor leader they have. Thus the palestinian people would remove him.\n \n 4) As for Killing Arafat outright, he becomes a martyr to the people and will be more of a thorn than before.\n \n 5) Arrest and Exile have the added disadvantage of keeping him alive. he will still be able to direct his organization. None would accept an Israeli trial of Chairman Arafat. That is more likely to cause war than his death. Exile will not achieve the desired result. From whatever locale he is, he will maintain control. That is how he has structured his organization.\n \n 6) israel's best bet is to participate in the roadmap and with the assistance of the international community push for Arafat to step down or be elected out. This would be an appropriate response.\n \n I state that Israel should not remove Arafat from power by means of Assassination, Expulsion, and or Arrest (With trial pending).\n \n Thanks for your consideration\n \n Sources:\n http://www.foreignpolicy.com/issue_julyaug_2002/ross.html\n http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,97278,00.html\n http://www.un.org/apps/news/subject.asp?SubjectID=1\n http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/09/22/world/main574396.shtml",

   "Epaphras_faith,\n \n Thank you for your response to my post. It's good to have a debate such as this. Once again good luck...\n \n Before I begin my responses to your counter argument I'd like to make sure we are clear on something. It being that Arafat is directly related to terrorism. Although you didn't say outright that you agreed with me about Arafat I saw no counter argument to my claim and evidence supporting my claim. With this in mind I will continue to refer to him as a terrorist.\n \n \nContention I: Arafat still has popular support. \n A. The Arab and Islamic community\n While Arafat is not necessarily liked he is supported throughout the arab and islamic world. Fox news reports from foreignpolicy.com that \"But no Arab leader is prepared to challenge him. All acknowledge him as the symbol of the Palestinian movement, and no one sees an alternative to him. \" \n No one is willing to go out on a limb for him but he is still consider the symbol of the palestinian movement.\n\n \n - This is absolutely true. Arafat has overwhelming support from the Palestinian people. As far as most Palestinian people are concerned Arafat is their leader. Of course there are those that don't support him, but still the majority does.\n But what exactly does this show? Yasser Arafat is a terrorist. This was clearly outlined in my previous post which you seemed to have no objections to. The number of Palestinians supporting Arafat is a number clearly supporting a terrorist. Yes it is clear that Arafat does have support among the Palestinian people, but what is your argument? Does this mean we condone his activity? How does a terrorist having support make him immune or different from any other terrorist? Yasser Arafat should be treated as a terrorist just as every other terrorist is.\n \n \nB. The United Nations\n 1. The UN passed a resolution 133-4 with 15 abstentions condemning Israel's intent to remove Yassar Arafat. \n \n \n This resolution was passed in the General Assembly and not in the Security Council. There is a substantial difference. The role of the General Assembly is to make recommendations on peace, security etc... Its other roles include: To initiate studies, promote political cooperation, receive and consider reports from the Security Council, and to elect non-permanent members of the Security Council. \n The role of the Security Council is to: maintain peace, determine actions for threats against peace, take military action, to implement economic sanctions, and of course pass resolutions dealing with world problems.\n \n The resolution originally went through the Security Council. It was vetoed by the United States. It was then put into the General Assembly where the US has no power to veto any such resolution. It passed in the General Assembly. Therefore the resolution you're referring to is a strong recommendation to Israel on their actions. It holds no real power.\n \n \n \nArafat is currently recognized by the world at large as the correct leader of the palestinian people.\n \n \n I don't see your point. A terrorist is a terrorist. They should all be treated the same. Please see my previous Osama Bin Laden comparison between the two terrorists.\n \n \nKofi Anan has repeatedly slammed Israel in the press for their attacks on various terrorists and their camps, most recently in Syria. \n \n \n Yes he has. Kofi Anan along with other countries also slammed the US when they freed the Iraqi people from a brutal dictator. I'm sorry that Mr. Anan condemns the fulfillment of resolutions put up by the Security Council. It is Israel's job to protect its citizens. Also Israel is obligated, just as every other country is, to live up to Security Council Resolutions.\n (See Security Council Resolutions: #1368, #1373, and #1377.) These resolutions regard terrorism and are to be fully implemented in all countries. Removing Arafat would be exactly what these resolutions require.\n What is your argument?\n The fact that others may disagree with the removal of Arafat does not put forth a reason.\n \n \nContention II: Israel is not well liked in the region. A great deal of biased exists. They are surrounded by muslim countires. A move of the magnitude proposed by Israel would only anger and enrage the situation. \n \n \n It would also aid the situation. You cannot have peace with terrorism in the region. Arafat is a supporter of terrorism and an obstacle to peace as I outlined in my first post. Arafat has continued to be the main figurehead for the Palestinian people. This has recently been accomplished from helping to oust the last Prime Minister. Removing Arafat is removing an obstacle. Peace cannot be reached with Arafat in power.\n Removing Arafat will certainly have a backlash from terrorist groups and countries will condemn Israel for their actions. Though in the long run it will help the peace process.\n \n \n\n A. Secretary of State Colin Powel said in an interview with Tony Snow of Fox News that, \n SNOW: Secretary Powell, Israel has defined Yasser Arafat as an obstacle to peace and has advocated his removal. What specifically would be the negative consequences of exiling Yasser Arafat? \n POWELL: The United States does not support either the elimination of him or the exile of Mr. Arafat. It's not our position, hasn't been. The Israeli government knows it. \n And I think the consequences would not be good ones. I think you can anticipate that there would be rage throughout the Arab world, the Muslim world, and in many other parts of the world. And I don't see how, at this delicate moment, that would serve the cause of moving forward on the road map. \n \n \n First off I'd like to say that I do not and never have supported the road map plan that has been implemented.\n Let me remind you that a paramount factor of the first phase of this plan is:\n A) \"Rebuilt and refocused Palestinian Authority security apparatus begins sustained, targeted, and effective operations aimed at confronting all those engaged in terror and dismantlement of terrorist capabilities and infrastructure. This includes commencing confiscation of illegal weapons and consolidation of security authority, free of association with terror and corruption.\" \n B) \"Palestinians declare an unequivocal end to violence and terrorism and undertake visible efforts on the ground to arrest, disrupt, and restrain individuals and groups conducting and planning violent attacks on Israelis anywhere.\"\n \n The road map plan has been introduced and attempted to been implemented in Israel. The plan has not taken affect in anyway. The road map is not valid until steps such as those above take place. They haven't. The road map cannot even begin until a terrorist such as Arafat is removed. His removal makes the other steps of the road map possible.\n \n \nHis point is clear. The roadmap to peace is the UN agreed upon process. To abandon it at this point would likely only incur harm and not solve the problem. \n \n \n Removing Arafat does not abandon the road map. Removing Arafat is an implementation of the road map. It is essential the terrorism stop and for this to happen terrorists must stop or be removed. Arafat has no intention of doing either as he has clearly shown through the things he has said and the things he has done.\n \n \nThe US attack in Iraq is already viewed as a support of \"zionism.\" The region is clearly unstable. Israel's removal of arafat is only more likely to destablize the region. \n \n \n As I have said, the removal of Arafat will certainly cause some unrest but removing such a terrorist will aid the peace process in the future. Arafat is an obstacle to the road map and we won't get anywhere if such an obstacle is blocking the implementation of such a road map.\n \n \nWhile this was said about the US attack on Iraq, it is not the same situation. 1) The attack on Iraq has already occurred and there is some regional unrest. Particularly on the part of Syria and Iran.\n \n \n How does that support your original statement of \"it is not the same situation\"? What unrest was there? Why on the part of Syria and Iran in particular? \n \n \n2) The US had many current UN resolutions that gave it the right to conduct such an operation. No such resolution currently exists in Israel\n \n \n I'm very glad you brought this up. First off let me ask you the reference for the \"many current UN resolutions\". I am only aware of #1441. \n \n UN Resolutions   \n \n Israel does have many current resolutions supporting the removal of Arafat. These are Security Council resolutions: #1373, #1368, and #1377.\n \n Most important is Security Council resolution #1373. Here are some excerpts from this resolution.\n \n \"1. Decides that all States shall:\n (a) Prevent and suppress the financing of terrorist acts;\n (b) Criminalize the wilful provision or collection, by any means, directly or\n indirectly, of funds by their nationals or in their territories with the intention that the funds should be used, or in the knowledge that they are to be used, in order to carry out terrorist acts;\"\n ....\n \"2. Decides also that all States shall:\n (a) Refrain from providing any form of support, active or passive, to entities or persons involved in terrorist acts, including by suppressing recruitment of members of terrorist groups and eliminating the supply of weapons to terrorists;\n (b) Take the necessary steps to prevent the commission of terrorist acts,\n including by provision of early warning to other States by exchange of information;\n (c) Deny safe haven to those who finance, plan, support, or commit terrorist\n acts, or provide safe havens;\"\n ...\n \"(e) Ensure that any person who participates in the financing, planning,\n preparation or perpetration of terrorist acts or in supporting terrorist acts is brought to justice and ensure that, in addition to any other measures against them, such terrorist acts are established as serious criminal offences in domestic laws and regulations and that the punishment duly reflects the seriousness of such terrorist\n acts;\n (f) Afford one another the greatest measure of assistance in connection with criminal investigations or criminal proceedings relating to the financing or support of terrorist acts, including assistance in obtaining evidence in their possession necessary for the proceedings;\"\n \n -----\n \n With this passed resolution how can you possibly say that Israel should not remove Arafat. A resolution such as this demands it. (See 2e).\n \n Also let us look at Resolution: #1377\n \n Reaffirms its unequivocal condemnation of all acts, methods and practices of terrorism as criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, in all their forms and manifestations, wherever and by whomever committed,\n \n ---- \n \n This shows that terrorism as seen by the UN is completely unjustifiable and is not condoned regardless of where and by whomever. This includes Yasser Arafat.\n \n \nB.The UN has repeatedly not supported Israel's actions on its own behalf in attacking palestinians. Resolutions, many vetoed by the US, have been brought condemning Israel without condemning the palestinians for their part. While this is wrong it none-the-less depicts the bias in the world community.\n \n \n Yes it is established that biased exists in the world against Israel for various reasons. I still don't understand your repeated argument here. Please elaborate and expand your point to a counter argument to my point of view.\n \n \n1) For Israel to remove Arafat would only increase the conflict they currently receive. As stated in my contentions, there is a bias against Israel and for the Palestinians. There also exists the conscept that the region currently supports Arafat and would likely view any move against him by Israel as so far out of line as to actually spark a regional war. Pakistan is known to have nuclear weapons. Saudi Arabia is highly critical of israel, Egypt, Iran, Syria, etc. Israel, likewise is likely in possession of proscribed weapons. An allegation that has never actually been investigated by the UN.\n \n \n Every country has the right to remove terrorists and every country should do so. The UN fully permits that action by its Security Council resolutions. \n \n \n2) The united States does not support Israel's removal of Arafat. While the US agrees that Arafat';s decrease in power is absolutely necessaary, the US believes that it can be accomplished through means that keeps Israel out of it. Colin Powel's comments confirm this.\n \n \n True the US does not openly support the removal Arafat. I find this to be just playing both sides of the coin. Notice they constantly condemn Arafat and vetoed a resolution that would have kept Arafat from being removed.\n What other means can be used?\n What is your point in that the US does not support the removal of a terrorist?\n \n \n3) There is no denying Israel's right to protect itself. Israel has the right to remove Arafat for reason's of national security. It is not always in the best interest of a person (or country) to exercise their rights. While they have the right ot do that, they also have the right not to. Israel has an opportunity to take the higher ground. To remove Arafat is illogical as it will only foment violence. To remove Arafat is illogical, because he is a poor leader. If I were in competition with another chess player for the championship. I would be more comfortable knowing he was a poor player. The appropriate thing to do in Israel's case would be to work to show the palestinian people what a poor leader they have. Thus the palestinian people would remove him.\n \n \n They have the obligation to protect their citizens from harm. That should be their top priority. Arafat wishes and supports the harming and killing of Israel's civilians. He should and must be removed if any sort of peace is to be achieved.\n Also why should Arafat be treated different from any other terrorist?\n Israel has issued reports, statements etc...\n There is no doubt that he is a poor leader. He recently smuggled over $5,000,000 that should have gone to aid the Palestinians. It instead went to his bank accounts.\n Anything negative about Arafat is dismissed by Palestinians as Israeli propaganda. It's obvious to most Palestinians that Arafat does support terrorism. The problem is that many of them have no objection to suicide bombings as they are seen to be justifiable.\n \n \n4) As for Killing Arafat outright, he becomes a martyr to the people and will be more of a thorn than before.\n \n \n If Osama Bin Laden was killed he would be seen as a martyr. Does this really matter? How would he be more of a thorn more than before?\n \n \n5) Arrest and Exile have the added disadvantage of keeping him alive. he will still be able to direct his organization. None would accept an Israeli trial of Chairman Arafat. That is more likely to cause war than his death. Exile will not achieve the desired result. From whatever locale he is, he will maintain control. That is how he has structured his organization.\n \n \n How could arrest and trial allow him to direct his organization? He'll be in jail. As for the pending trial the possible locations include: UN, US, Germany, France, Britain, or Russia. Exile will certainly limit his control greatly. He would eventually fade from the public eye.\n \n \n \n6) israel's best bet is to participate in the roadmap and with the assistance of the international community push for Arafat to step down or be elected out. This would be an appropriate response.\n \n \n Israel has agreed to the conditions of the road map. The road map has yet to begin. How is removing Arafat not complying with road map? If the PA won't stop terrorism then of course Israel is forced to. The UN will never push out Arafat. Because as you said: \"Arafat is currently recognized by the world at large as the correct leader of the palestinian people.\" This is the same UN is wanted a resolution to force Israel to halt even their threats. As for an election, who will run against him. There haven't been elections since 1996. \n \n \nI state that Israel should not remove Arafat from power by means of Assassination, Expulsion, and or Arrest (With trial pending).\n \n \n In conclusion\n \n What difference is there between Arafat and a typical terrorist? What about the comparison to Osama Bin Laden? Why should all terrorists except Arafat be forced to hide and live in caves while Arafat is protected by the UN?\n \n Sources:\n \n http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/unsc_functions.html\n http://www.un.org/Docs/scres/2001/sc2001.htm\n http://216.26.163.62/2003/me_palestinians_09_28.html\n http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=27973\n \n \n --- End Post #3 ---\n \n Thanks for reading this\n \n Always Stay Open Minded",

   "Thanks for the encouragement poet. Continue in this fashion. It is a good debate.\n \n \nEpaphras_faith,\n \n Thank you for your response to my post. It's good to have a debate such as this. Once again good luck...\n \n Before I begin my responses to your counter argument I'd like to make sure we are clear on something. It being that Arafat is directly related to terrorism. Although you didn't say outright that you agreed with me about Arafat I saw no counter argument to my claim and evidence supporting my claim. With this in mind I will continue to refer to him as a terrorist.\n \n \n \n - This is absolutely true. Arafat has overwhelming support from the Palestinian people. As far as most Palestinian people are concerned Arafat is their leader. Of course there are those that don't support him, but still the majority does.\n But what exactly does this show? Yasser Arafat is a terrorist. This was clearly outlined in my previous post which you seemed to have no objections to. The number of Palestinians supporting Arafat is a number clearly supporting a terrorist. Yes it is clear that Arafat does have support among the Palestinian people, but what is your argument? Does this mean we condone his activity? How does a terrorist having support make him immune or different from any other terrorist? Yasser Arafat should be treated as a terrorist just as every other terrorist is.\n\n \n My point in claiming that Arafat has overwhelming support is to point out the immense backlash that would be felt by israel. If Israel thinks it has problems with Arafat in control then with ISRAEL removing Arafat the backlash would be unbelievable. This was essentially the remarks of Colin Powell that I quoted earlier. My opponent has missed this point.\n \n I would agree that Yassar Arafat supports Terrorism. My argument is not that he should or should not be removed. My argument is heavily focused on current world support and on the fact that ISRAEL should not be the one working on his removal. This goes specifically to the topic and is germain. The support of the palestinian people is more than Sadam Hussein had and more than even Osama Bin Laden had.\n \n \n \n \nThis resolution was passed in the General Assembly and not in the Security Council. There is a substantial difference. The role of the General Assembly is to make recommendations on peace, security etc... Its other roles include: To initiate studies, promote political cooperation, receive and consider reports from the Security Council, and to elect non-permanent members of the Security Council. \n The role of the Security Council is to: maintain peace, determine actions for threats against peace, take military action, to implement economic sanctions, and of course pass resolutions dealing with world problems.\n \n The resolution originally went through the Security Council. It was vetoed by the United States. It was then put into the General Assembly where the US has no power to veto any such resolution. It passed in the General Assembly. Therefore the resolution you're referring to is a strong recommendation to Israel on their actions. It holds no real power.\n\n \n Regardless of the \"real power\" the point here is that Arafat has support not only from the palestinian people but also the world community. Only Israel has claimed that those provisions of the UN for terrorism allow them to remove Arafat. No other country has supported that position, not even the US. The US had the support of over 43 nations when it invaded IRAQ and the Iraqi people were vastly terrified of Hussein. This is not the case with Arafat and the palestinians.\n \n The issue is, again, that Israel does not have the support of anyone for the type of move proposed by my opponent. \n \n \nI don't see your point. A terrorist is a terrorist. They should all be treated the same. Please see my previous Osama Bin Laden comparison between the two terrorists. \n \n Yes he has. Kofi Anan along with other countries also slammed the US when they freed the Iraqi people from a brutal dictator. I'm sorry that Mr. Anan condemns the fulfillment of resolutions put up by the Security Council. It is Israel's job to protect its citizens. Also Israel is obligated, just as every other country is, to live up to Security Council Resolutions.\n (See Security Council Resolutions: #1368, #1373, and #1377.) These resolutions regard terrorism and are to be fully implemented in all countries. Removing Arafat would be exactly what these resolutions require.\n What is your argument?\n The fact that others may disagree with the removal of Arafat does not put forth a reason.\n\n \n The remomval of Arafat is not the topic. The topic is the removal of Arafat by ISRAEL. Israel is the exact wrong entity to do this. My oponent has stated that there will be problems but it will aid the process. I submit that if Israel removes Artafat then Israel will find itself surrounded by enemies and no one to come to its aid. Nto even the US would be able to support the removal of Arafat and both President Bush and Colin Powell have said this. It is not simply that others disagree. This is not an issue of debate in a school yard. We are talking about implications which include war in the middle east. Israel by far has a superior technology but cannot stand against a nuclear developing Iran, a syrian army, egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Pakistan, Afganistan, Turkey, and several others. We are talking about war. It will happen. Again Colin Powell has said as much. \n \n \nIt would also aid the situation. You cannot have peace with terrorism in the region. Arafat is a supporter of terrorism and an obstacle to peace as I outlined in my first post. Arafat has continued to be the main figurehead for the Palestinian people. This has recently been accomplished from helping to oust the last Prime Minister. Removing Arafat is removing an obstacle. Peace cannot be reached with Arafat in power.\n Removing Arafat will certainly have a backlash from terrorist groups and countries will condemn Israel for their actions. Though in the long run it will help the peace process.\n\n \n See my previous argument. Same answer. It is not condemnation. It is war.\n \n \nFirst off I'd like to say that I do not and never have supported the road map plan that has been implemented.\n Let me remind you that a paramount factor of the first phase of this plan is:\n A) \"Rebuilt and refocused Palestinian Authority security apparatus begins sustained, targeted, and effective operations aimed at confronting all those engaged in terror and dismantlement of terrorist capabilities and infrastructure. This includes commencing confiscation of illegal weapons and consolidation of security authority, free of association with terror and corruption.\" \n B) \"Palestinians declare an unequivocal end to violence and terrorism and undertake visible efforts on the ground to arrest, disrupt, and restrain individuals and groups conducting and planning violent attacks on Israelis anywhere.\"\n \n The road map plan has been introduced and attempted to been implemented in Israel. The plan has not taken affect in anyway. The road map is not valid until steps such as those above take place. They haven't. The road map cannot even begin until a terrorist such as Arafat is removed. His removal makes the other steps of the road map possible. \n \n Removing Arafat does not abandon the road map. Removing Arafat is an implementation of the road map. It is essential the terrorism stop and for this to happen terrorists must stop or be removed. Arafat has no intention of doing either as he has clearly shown through the things he has said and the things he has done.\n\n \n It is only one possible implementation of the Road Map. Regardless of whether or not my opponent approves of the Road Map, it is the approved method for the international community. There is nothing specific in the UN about removing Arafat by ANY one. Israel doing this would only result in suicide. \n \n \nAs I have said, the removal of Arafat will certainly cause some unrest but removing such a terrorist will aid the peace process in the future. Arafat is an obstacle to the road map and we won't get anywhere if such an obstacle is blocking the implementation of such a road map.\n How does that support your original statement of \"it is not the same situation\"? What unrest was there? Why on the part of Syria and Iran in particular? \n\n \n Syria has recently received attack from Israel. The US supported Israel but asked that they not do that again. Syria is on the edge already. Iran is developing nuclear weapons although they deny it. Israel's danger grows daily.\n \n \nI'm very glad you brought this up. First off let me ask you the reference for the \"many current UN resolutions\". I am only aware of #1441. \n \n UN Resolutions   \n \n Israel does have many current resolutions supporting the removal of Arafat. These are Security Council resolutions: #1373, #1368, and #1377.\n \n Most important is Security Council resolution #1373. Here are some excerpts from this resolution.\n \n \"1. Decides that all States shall:\n (a) Prevent and suppress the financing of terrorist acts;\n (b) Criminalize the wilful provision or collection, by any means, directly or\n indirectly, of funds by their nationals or in their territories with the intention that the funds should be used, or in the knowledge that they are to be used, in order to carry out terrorist acts;\"\n ....\n \"2. Decides also that all States shall:\n (a) Refrain from providing any form of support, active or passive, to entities or persons involved in terrorist acts, including by suppressing recruitment of members of terrorist groups and eliminating the supply of weapons to terrorists;\n (b) Take the necessary steps to prevent the commission of terrorist acts,\n including by provision of early warning to other States by exchange of information;\n (c) Deny safe haven to those who finance, plan, support, or commit terrorist\n acts, or provide safe havens;\"\n ...\n \"(e) Ensure that any person who participates in the financing, planning,\n preparation or perpetration of terrorist acts or in supporting terrorist acts is brought to justice and ensure that, in addition to any other measures against them, such terrorist acts are established as serious criminal offences in domestic laws and regulations and that the punishment duly reflects the seriousness of such terrorist\n acts;\n (f) Afford one another the greatest measure of assistance in connection with criminal investigations or criminal proceedings relating to the financing or support of terrorist acts, including assistance in obtaining evidence in their possession necessary for the proceedings;\"\n \n -----\n \n With this passed resolution how can you possibly say that Israel should not remove Arafat. A resolution such as this demands it. (See 2e).\n \n Also let us look at Resolution: #1377\n \n Reaffirms its unequivocal condemnation of all acts, methods and practices of terrorism as criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, in all their forms and manifestations, wherever and by whomever committed,\n This shows that terrorism as seen by the UN is completely unjustifiable and is not condoned regardless of where and by whomever. This includes Yasser Arafat.\n Yes it is established that biased exists in the world against Israel for various reasons. I still don't understand your repeated argument here. Please elaborate and expand your point to a counter argument to my point of view.\n Every country has the right to remove terrorists and every country should do so. The UN fully permits that action by its Security Council resolutions. \n\n \n The UN resolutions do not specifically allow ISRAEL the right to remove Arafat. All countries are expected to cooperate to remove terrorists. And again, my argument is not that Arafat is not a terrorist. Just because I have the right to call the 400 pound bully across the street a jerk does not mean I SHOULD do so. Israel's rights are not in question. The question is what should be done. Israel should protect its borders and its citizenry but leave Arafat to the international community. The US has shown no signs of weakness in its actions. It attacked Iraq claiming support from the previous UN resolutions. Its locale and other international support made it in a position to do something this drastic. Israel is hardly in the same boat. Again, Israel risks total anhilation if it attempts to remove Arafat. \n \n \nTrue the US does not openly support the removal Arafat. I find this to be just playing both sides of the coin. Notice they constantly condemn Arafat and vetoed a resolution that would have kept Arafat from being removed.\n What other means can be used?\n What is your point in that the US does not support the removal of a terrorist?\n\n \n Israel would not have US support in advance of a war that Israel would depend on the US. \n \n \nThey have the obligation to protect their citizens from harm. That should be their top priority. Arafat wishes and supports the harming and killing of Israel's civilians. He should and must be removed if any sort of peace is to be achieved.\n Also why should Arafat be treated different from any other terrorist?\n Israel has issued reports, statements etc...\n There is no doubt that he is a poor leader. He recently smuggled over $5,000,000 that should have gone to aid the Palestinians. It instead went to his bank accounts.\n Anything negative about Arafat is dismissed by Palestinians as Israeli propaganda. It's obvious to most Palestinians that Arafat does support terrorism. The problem is that many of them have no objection to suicide bombings as they are seen to be justifiable.\n\n \n Poor leaders as opponents should be kept around. They tend only to strengthen the position of the right. Israel is only helped by Arafat's lack of leadership ability. It will cause the international community to rise against him. \n \n \nIf Osama Bin Laden was killed he would be seen as a martyr. Does this really matter? How would he be more of a thorn more than before?\n\n \n Bin Laden is not a leader of a budding country. Arafat's followers would only have more international support if Israel acted to kill Arafat. It owuld leave Israel in a position where no one would be able to negotiate on their behalf. War would be inevitable. It require the destruction of the entire palestinian population to prevent a war with them. This will not happen in the middle east which is predominantly arab. \n \n \nHow could arrest and trial allow him to direct his organization? He'll be in jail. As for the pending trial the possible locations include: UN, US, Germany, France, Britain, or Russia. Exile will certainly limit his control greatly. He would eventually fade from the public eye.\n\n \n One would have to be very naive to think that a person would be unable to direct from jail. Drugs, organized crime etc. all are perpetrated within a jail. Plus the resulting media coverage which could not be avoided would only serve to strengthen the palestinians and the Arab world against Israel. Again, Israel is the wrong entity to work this issue. \n \n \nIsrael has agreed to the conditions of the road map. The road map has yet to begin. How is removing Arafat not complying with road map? If the PA won't stop terrorism then of course Israel is forced to. The UN will never push out Arafat. Because as you said: \"Arafat is currently recognized by the world at large as the correct leader of the palestinian people.\" This is the same UN is wanted a resolution to force Israel to halt even their threats. As for an election, who will run against him. There haven't been elections since 1996. \n \n \n \n In conclusion\n \n What difference is there between Arafat and a typical terrorist? What about the comparison to Osama Bin Laden? Why should all terrorists except Arafat be forced to hide and live in caves while Arafat is protected by the UN?\n\n \n The differences are this. Arafat is the internationally recognized leader of a nation or at least a budding nation. Arafat has international support for this position. Bin Laden does not. Neither did Hussein. While Hussein was a leader he was not supported by a majority of Iraqis and certainly not by the international community.\n \n Again, Arafat is a weak leader and Israel could benefit from that by exploiting his weaknesses. The issue is ISRAEL removing Arafat. They are the exact wrong entity to do that. Only another, better insulated nation with the support of the international community could accomplish such a thing. That situation does not currently exist.\n \n For this reason I ask the judge to vote with me and say that ISRAEL shoud NOT remove Arafat by any means.\n \n Thank you for your time. As for sources, I refer to the preceding sources cited by both myself and my opponent. \n \n My arguments come directly from them and are mostly logic based with little further evidence needed.",

   "Epaphras_faith,\n \n Thanks for the debate.\n \n \nMy point in claiming that Arafat has overwhelming support is to point out the immense backlash that would be felt by israel. If Israel thinks it has problems with Arafat in control then with ISRAEL removing Arafat the backlash would be unbelievable. This was essentially the remarks of Colin Powell that I quoted earlier. My opponent has missed this point.\n \n \n Of course Israel would expect a backlash. Prior to the removal of Arafat they would enforce extremely heavy security. Of course no security is full proof but it would certainly catch many of the attempting suicide bombers. \n The backlash would consist of world criticism and a series of suicide bombers. How many suicide bombers is not a defenite number. Anywhere from 1 to 100 attempting suicide bombers could be expected. The most likely event is that 5-10 or so would make it through. This would in worse terms result in anywhere from 80 - 100 civilian casualties. \n Removing Arafat (various ways) would have a backlash in store for Israel. In the long run removing Arafat would prevent more bombings than it would create. With Arafat expectantly pouring millions and millions of dollars into suicide bombers we can only expect more Israeli deaths in the future. \n Later in your post you said it was better for Israel to push out Arafat with international support. This would expectantly never occur. Even if it were to occur it would take years upon years. Israel does not have this kind of time. Mothers shopping in grocery stores do not have this kind of time. Children on the way home from school do not have this time. The years and years it would take to remove Arafat would result in many Israeli civilian deaths. This would far surmount the 80 - 100 civilian deaths projected at Arafat's removal. We are talking in the ball park from 100 - 1,000 Israeli civilians. \n Those are some of the lowest numbers I could possibly hope for. If you remember in my first post: The Israel army released a report tying Yasser Arafat to the large shipment of arms worth millions and millions of dollars. This ship carried thousands of bullets and hundreds of bombs. These were not your typical strap on bombs. The sort of bombs in a shipment such as this involved explosives with much more explosive capability. One of these bombs correctly places (such as C-4) could result in the death of hundreds of Israeli civilians.\n Israel can not wait around for the international community to step in (which would probably not occur) or hundreds or thousands to be killed.\n If a shipment of these kinds of bombs were to ever be put into the hands of terrorists the casualties would be beyond imagination. \n Israel can not wait for this to happen!\n \n \n My point being: Israel cannot afford to wait for the international community or Palestinians to take action against Arafat. Something like this would probably never occur and even if it did would take many years to process through. That gives Arafat the rest of his life to continue to support terrorists and terrorism. Another month waiting may very well mean mass casualties.\n \n \nI would agree that Yassar Arafat supports Terrorism. My argument is not that he should or should not be removed. My argument is heavily focused on current world support and on the fact that ISRAEL should not be the one working on his removal. This goes specifically to the topic and is germain. The support of the palestinian people is more than Sadam Hussein had and more than even Osama Bin Laden had.\n \n \n Once again Israel cannot afford to wait. Nor should they have to. Israel is a free state. The job of its government is to protect its civilians. This takes the number one priority over all other government functions. Israel cannot succesfully protect its citizens with people such as Arafat working against them. The priority and obligation to remove Arafat overrides the \"obligation\" to appease public opinion. \n \n Why do you think that having support makes a terrorist immune? No immunity can be granted to any terrorist if this is to be a safe world. \n \n *If Osama Bin Laden had had more public support should the US have not gone after him?*\n \n *What does support really matter when you are dealing with terrorists?*\n \n \nRegardless of the \"real power\" the point here is that Arafat has support not only from the palestinian people but also the world community.\n \n \n Support? Once again you bring your main argument down to support. Support does not grant immunity any other terrorist? Why should it be this way for Arafat?\n \n Do you know why the \"world community\" does not support Arafat?\n \n - When you speak of world community I must assume you mean counties such as: France, Germany, (Arab nations), Britain, etc...\n These countries aren't dealing with terrorism on a daily basis. They aren't dealing with terrorism period!\n \n None of these countries have suicide bombers walking into their cafes, shopping malls, or city buses and blowing themselves up. They don't deal with this. All these counties and there citizens know of terrorism is what they see on the news. They aren't there. They don't have relatives, friends, family members, co-workers being killed. They don't see entire families just wiped out at the hand of rutheless terrorist orginizations.\n How dare they condemn Israel for any of its actions against terrorism. How long do you think counties such as this including the US would deal with such?\n \n In conclusion:\n Countries that you speak of (\"world community\") do not deal with terrorism. They do not go through the expereinces and suffer the hardships that Israel must. Therefore these countries have really no valid say in how Israel protect its citizens.\n How do countries such as France, or Germany who don't have to deal with terrorism even have a say in the matter?\n Of course they can talk as they will in the UN but truly Israel cannot respect their opinion about Israel \"lacking hesitation\" and \"needing to show restraint\". \n \n *As a result I don't see how a terrorist having support of the community should deter Israel from protecting its citizens, which is exactly what they are doing if they are to remove Arafat.*\n \n *See above argument to your argument of \"support\".*\n \n \nOnly Israel has claimed that those provisions of the UN for terrorism allow them to remove Arafat.\n \n \n I've never heard of Israel making such a claim. This is my claim that I found evidence to support. \n How can you deny that these resolutions do not give Israel a right to remove Arafat?\n \n True, these resolutions do not focus on Israel. They focus on terrorism as a global problem.\n \n Resolution: #1373:\n \n \"(a) Prevent and suppress the financing of terrorist acts;\n (b) Criminalize the wilful provision or collection, by any means, directly or\n indirectly, of funds by their nationals or in their territories with the intention that the funds should be used, or in the knowledge that they are to be used, in order to carry out terrorist acts;\"\"\n \n How can you claim this does not apply to Israel? Arafat does all of these things.\n \n *The resolution relates directly to terrorism and Arafat is a terrorist and is clearly directly related to terrorism. Why do you claim that this doesn't apply to Arafat?*\n \n \n \nThe issue is, again, that Israel does not have the support of anyone for the type of move proposed by my opponent. \n \n \n If the \"world community\" changed their opinion and wanted Osama Bin Laden to become immune from US persecution should the US simply leave him alone?\n \n \nMy oponent has stated that there will be problems but it will aid the process. I submit that if Israel removes Artafat then Israel will find itself surrounded by enemies and no one to come to its aid. Nto even the US would be able to support the removal of Arafat and both President Bush and Colin Powell have said this. It is not simply that others disagree. This is not an issue of debate in a school yard. We are talking about implications which include war in the middle east. Israel by far has a superior technology but cannot stand against a nuclear developing Iran, a syrian army, egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Pakistan, Afganistan, Turkey, and several others. We are talking about war. It will happen. Again Colin Powell has said as much. \n \n \n Israel isn't already surrounded by enemies?\n The US would defend Israel's actions. This in part because of our close alliance with Israel as well as our country being 85% Christian. One of the main reasons I beleive the US has continued to support terrorism is because of the Christian views on Israel. (But I'm not going into that).\n Regardless the US would stand beside Israel. \n \n War is not a likely result of removing Arafat. European countries would not be involved and would probably condemn war. The US would support Israel militarily and financially as they do and have done in past wars. \n \n Israel is in posession of nuclear weapons. (12 if I remember correctly) They by far have the strongest army with the highest level of technology in the region. \n \n Afghanistan, Kuwait, Pakistan, and Turkey have no participated in any of the past wars with Israel. They are not likely to either. (Afghanistan is still in the process of rebuilding the government and is occupied by the US).\n \n What other countries?\n \n Another war launched by Arab countries are not likely in the near future as it is now even with the removal of Arafat. Countries such as Egypt have lost enough from wars with Israel. Israel has been able to defend itself in every war including the Yom Kippur war which was a suprise attack that Israel was not prepared for.\n \n With the US backing, Europeans condemning, Israel's superior position, past wars, and few Arabs countries participating; war is not a likely result of the removal of Arafat. Although you would certainly see the backlash we have discussed.\n \n What makes you think war is so inevitable?\n \n What comments by Colin Powell implied that war would occur if Israel removed Arafat?\n \n \nIt is only one possible implementation of the Road Map. Regardless of whether or not my opponent approves of the Road Map, it is the approved method for the international community. There is nothing specific in the UN about removing Arafat by ANY one. Israel doing this would only result in suicide.\n \n \n Removing terrorist from power is a must in the road map. The road map has no started and therefore cannot actaully \"continue\" at this \"part of the road map\". This is in part because of Arafat. His support and funding of terrorism has delayed the road map from even beginning.\n \n \nSyria has recently received attack from Israel. The US supported Israel but asked that they not do that again. Syria is on the edge already. Iran is developing nuclear weapons although they deny it. Israel's danger grows daily.\n \n \n I've covered the war issue above but thank you for responding to my comments adequately. \n \n \n \nThe UN resolutions do not specifically allow ISRAEL the right to remove Arafat. All countries are expected to cooperate to remove terrorists.\n \n \n Please...\n The UN resolutions do not specifically allow any country the right to remove any terrorists is basically can be said with that kind of argument. Does this mean the US does not have the right to remove Osama Bin Laden because the UN resolution does not specifically allow them to do so?\n They allow the states to remove terrorists. Arafat resides in the state of Israel and is a terrorist that results in the killing of Israel's civilians. Therefore it is in Israel's obligation and right to remove Arafat.\n \n \n \n And again, my argument is not that Arafat is not a terrorist.\n \n \n Yet you wish to defend him....\n \n \nI have the right to call the 400 pound bully across the street a jerk does not mean I SHOULD do so.\n \n \n There is a difference in these situations. You should do something about the \"bully\" which is what Israel would be doing by removing Arafat.\n \n \n Bad comparison.\n \n \nIsrael should protect its borders and its citizenry but leave Arafat to the international community.\n \n \n Yes but Arafat is assisting the attack of its citizens. How can Israel protect its citizens and leave Arafat alone if they are waiting for the international community to do something? \n \n \nThe US has shown no signs of weakness in its actions. It attacked Iraq claiming support from the previous UN resolutions. Its locale and other international support made it in a position to do something this drastic. Israel is hardly in the same boat. \n \n \n Israel is only in the same boat in that there are US resolutions that support the removal of Arafat. They are following up on these resolutions.\n \n \nIsrael would not have US support in advance of a war that Israel would depend on the US. \n \n \n From what evidence do you draw this conclusion? The US has always supported Israel, even in past Arab-Israeli wars.\n (I have stated my reasons of why the US would support Israel previously in the post.)\n \n \nPoor leaders as opponents should be kept around. They tend only to strengthen the position of the right. Israel is only helped by Arafat's lack of leadership ability. It will cause the international community to rise against him. \n \n \n \"the international community to rise against him\"...? \n Not so. You notice they did not call an \"urgent\" security council meeting when 19 people were killed in Haifa. They also did not call a meeting when Arafat stole 500 million dollars in aid money. \n The international community pays no attention to the wrong doings of Arafat and they can't be counted on to do something about it.\n \n \nBin Laden is not a leader of a budding country. Arafat's followers would only have more international support if Israel acted to kill Arafat. It owuld leave Israel in a position where no one would be able to negotiate on their behalf. War would be inevitable. It require the destruction of the entire palestinian population to prevent a war with them. This will not happen in the middle east which is predominantly arab. \n \n \n You continue to grant immunity to a terrorist because he has support. I've covered the issue of war previously. I'm sure we will be discussing it further.\n Yes Israel would face a time of criticism but the world would move on as we must do. The US would stand by Israel as may some other countries who \"abstained\" (sp) from the security council resolution dealing with Arafat. \n \n \nOne would have to be very naive to think that a person would be unable to direct from jail. Drugs, organized crime etc. all are perpetrated within a jail. Plus the resulting media coverage which could not be avoided would only serve to strengthen the palestinians and the Arab world against Israel. Again, Israel is the wrong entity to work this issue. \n \n \n Arafat would not be handled as a normal prisoner. He would most likely be allowed no phone calls than to his lawyer. All papers going back and forth between his lawyers would be checked for terrorist related activity. How would he then be able to direct his orginization. Trust me, precautions can be taken to prevent Arafat from in any way being involved with his orginizations. (These include freezing all assets).\n \n I pefer the assasination of Arafat myself.\n \n \n \nThe differences are this. Arafat is the internationally recognized leader of a nation or at least a budding nation. Arafat has international support for this position. Bin Laden does not. Neither did Hussein. While Hussein was a leader he was not supported by a majority of Iraqis and certainly not by the international community.\n\n \n Still your argument boils down to support. Israel cannot afford to not take actions against a terrorist who is responsible for murdering men women and children because of international support.\n \n \nAgain, Arafat is a weak leader and Israel could benefit from that by exploiting his weaknesses. The issue is ISRAEL removing Arafat. They are the exact wrong entity to do that. Only another, better insulated nation with the support of the international community could accomplish such a thing. That situation does not currently exist.\n \n \n The next few hundred (or even thousand) of people who are going to die because of people with links to Arafat do not have time for the international community to act.\n \n I restate my position that Israel should remove Arafat.\n \n \n Sources:\n \n No new sources.\n \n --- End Post #5 ---\n \n Thanks for reading this\n \n Always Stay Open Minded",

   "\n Of course Israel would expect a backlash. Prior to the removal of Arafat they would enforce extremely heavy security. Of course no security is full proof but it would certainly catch many of the attempting suicide bombers. \n The backlash would consist of world criticism and a series of suicide bombers. How many suicide bombers is not a defenite number. Anywhere from 1 to 100 attempting suicide bombers could be expected. The most likely event is that 5-10 or so would make it through. This would in worse terms result in anywhere from 80 - 100 civilian casualties. \n Removing Arafat (various ways) would have a backlash in store for Israel. In the long run removing Arafat would prevent more bombings than it would create. With Arafat expectantly pouring millions and millions of dollars into suicide bombers we can only expect more Israeli deaths in the future. \n Later in your post you said it was better for Israel to push out Arafat with international support. This would expectantly never occur. Even if it were to occur it would take years upon years. Israel does not have this kind of time. Mothers shopping in grocery stores do not have this kind of time. Children on the way home from school do not have this time. The years and years it would take to remove Arafat would result in many Israeli civilian deaths. This would far surmount the 80 - 100 civilian deaths projected at Arafat's removal. We are talking in the ball park from 100 - 1,000 Israeli civilians. \n Those are some of the lowest numbers I could possibly hope for. If you remember in my first post: The Israel army released a report tying Yasser Arafat to the large shipment of arms worth millions and millions of dollars. This ship carried thousands of bullets and hundreds of bombs. These were not your typical strap on bombs. The sort of bombs in a shipment such as this involved explosives with much more explosive capability. One of these bombs correctly places (such as C-4) could result in the death of hundreds of Israeli civilians.\n Israel can not wait around for the international community to step in (which would probably not occur) or hundreds or thousands to be killed.\n If a shipment of these kinds of bombs were to ever be put into the hands of terrorists the casualties would be beyond imagination. \n Israel can not wait for this to happen!\n \n \n My point being: Israel cannot afford to wait for the international community or Palestinians to take action against Arafat. Something like this would probably never occur and even if it did would take many years to process through. That gives Arafat the rest of his life to continue to support terrorists and terrorism. Another month waiting may very well mean mass casualties.\n \n \n \n Once again Israel cannot afford to wait. Nor should they have to. Israel is a free state. The job of its government is to protect its civilians. This takes the number one priority over all other government functions. Israel cannot succesfully protect its citizens with people such as Arafat working against them. The priority and obligation to remove Arafat overrides the \"obligation\" to appease public opinion. \n \n Why do you think that having support makes a terrorist immune? No immunity can be granted to any terrorist if this is to be a safe world. \n \n *If Osama Bin Laden had had more public support should the US have not gone after him?*\n \n *What does support really matter when you are dealing with terrorists?*\n\n \n Israel cannot afford to do this on their own. Criticism is not the only issue, nor is suicide bombings. Currently Israel has nearly zero support from most countries of the world. Even the US is scaling back its presence in the region. Not its support for israel, but the US has made it clear that they do not support israel's removal of Arafat.\n \n \n \n \nSupport? Once again you bring your main argument down to support. Support does not grant immunity any other terrorist? Why should it be this way for Arafat?\n \n Do you know why the \"world community\" does not support Arafat?\n \n - When you speak of world community I must assume you mean counties such as: France, Germany, (Arab nations), Britain, etc...\n These countries aren't dealing with terrorism on a daily basis. They aren't dealing with terrorism period!\n \n None of these countries have suicide bombers walking into their cafes, shopping malls, or city buses and blowing themselves up. They don't deal with this. All these counties and there citizens know of terrorism is what they see on the news. They aren't there. They don't have relatives, friends, family members, co-workers being killed. They don't see entire families just wiped out at the hand of rutheless terrorist orginizations.\n How dare they condemn Israel for any of its actions against terrorism. How long do you think counties such as this including the US would deal with such?\n \n In conclusion:\n Countries that you speak of (\"world community\") do not deal with terrorism. They do not go through the expereinces and suffer the hardships that Israel must. Therefore these countries have really no valid say in how Israel protect its citizens.\n How do countries such as France, or Germany who don't have to deal with terrorism even have a say in the matter?\n Of course they can talk as they will in the UN but truly Israel cannot respect their opinion about Israel \"lacking hesitation\" and \"needing to show restraint\".\n\n \n You assumption is incorrect. 90% of the UN General Assembly is against the attacks and the fence in Israel. This is in an article that I have previously posted. I certainly do not limit myself to those few countries. As a matter of point I said that the US and one other country are the only ones that Supported Israel.\n \n \n \n*As a result I don't see how a terrorist having support of the community should deter Israel from protecting its citizens, which is exactly what they are doing if they are to remove Arafat.*\n\n \n The issue of support deterring ISRAEL from doing anything is because of the backlash. Syria has already expressed its willingness to attack Israel in response to attacks made by Israel in Syrian territory\n 1)http://www.drudgereportarchives.com/data/2003/10/22/20031022_195004_flash4.htm\n 2) http://www.drudgereportarchives.com/goto/?getPage=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Ereuters%2Ecom%2FprinterFriendlyPopup%2Ejhtml%3Ftype%3DtopNews%26storyID%3D3577501&return=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Edrudgereportarchives%2Ecom%2Fdsp%2Fsearch%2Ehtm%3Ffrompage%3D1%26StartRow%3D13%26maxrows%3D12%26searchFor%3Disrael\n \n \nI've never heard of Israel making such a claim. This is my claim that I found evidence to support. \n How can you deny that these resolutions do not give Israel a right to remove Arafat?\n \n True, these resolutions do not focus on Israel. They focus on terrorism as a global problem.\n \n Resolution: #1373:\n \n \"(a) Prevent and suppress the financing of terrorist acts;\n (b) Criminalize the wilful provision or collection, by any means, directly or\n indirectly, of funds by their nationals or in their territories with the intention that the funds should be used, or in the knowledge that they are to be used, in order to carry out terrorist acts;\"\"\n \n How can you claim this does not apply to Israel? Arafat does all of these things.\n \n *The resolution relates directly to terrorism and Arafat is a terrorist and is clearly directly related to terrorism. Why do you claim that this doesn't apply to Arafat?*\n\n \n I have never denied that Israel has the right. I have stated that exercising that right would be foolish. \n \n \nIf the \"world community\" changed their opinion and wanted Osama Bin Laden to become immune from US persecution should the US simply leave him alone?\n Irrelevant as it has nothing to do with the situation. The circumstances are not parallell. \n \n \nIsrael isn't already surrounded by enemies?\n The US would defend Israel's actions. This in part because of our close alliance with Israel as well as our country being 85% Christian. One of the main reasons I beleive the US has continued to support terrorism is because of the Christian views on Israel. (But I'm not going into that).\n Regardless the US would stand beside Israel. \n \n War is not a likely result of removing Arafat. European countries would not be involved and would probably condemn war. The US would support Israel militarily and financially as they do and have done in past wars. \n \n Israel is in posession of nuclear weapons. (12 if I remember correctly) They by far have the strongest army with the highest level of technology in the region. \n\n \n Israel's nuclear arsenal is useless as the place to use it is in the neighborhood so to speak. They would simply sontaminate themselves.\n \n War may not be a likely result. i am willing to admit that. However it is a distinct possibility and any policy that potentiates it would need to consider it. You state that there would be an increase in suicide bombings and that Israel could step up security to prevent them. Well then. by all means do that now and there is no need to remove Arafat. The roadmap can continue and suicide bombers can be arressted and jailed.\n \n Israel is surrounded by Arabs on all sides. Yes, the US would likely support Israel in a war, but may find it very difficult should they forcibly remove Arafat. I am not so certain that the US would support Israel. You provide no evidence to prove that we would, only that I provided no connection to Colin Powell's statements. Colin Powell did not go that far. However the absence of such a statement does not necessarily mean we would support Israel. The potential for a limited war in the region, particularly with Syria and Egypt and even possibly Saudi Arabia exists.\n \nAfghanistan, Kuwait, Pakistan, and Turkey have no participated in any of the past wars with Israel. They are not likely to either. (Afghanistan is still in the process of rebuilding the government and is occupied by the US).\n \n What other countries?\n \n Another war launched by Arab countries are not likely in the near future as it is now even with the removal of Arafat. Countries such as Egypt have lost enough from wars with Israel. Israel has been able to defend itself in every war including the Yom Kippur war which was a suprise attack that Israel was not prepared for.\n \n With the US backing, Europeans condemning, Israel's superior position, past wars, and few Arabs countries participating; war is not a likely result of the removal of Arafat. Although you would certainly see the backlash we have discussed.\n \n What makes you think war is so inevitable?\n \n What comments by Colin Powell implied that war would occur if Israel removed Arafat?\n\n \n As stated above. War is not inevitable, but the possiblity is there and then we need to consider the consequences and what you are trying to accomplish with your plan. \n \n \nPlease...\n The UN resolutions do not specifically allow any country the right to remove any terrorists is basically can be said with that kind of argument. Does this mean the US does not have the right to remove Osama Bin Laden because the UN resolution does not specifically allow them to do so?\n They allow the states to remove terrorists. Arafat resides in the state of Israel and is a terrorist that results in the killing of Israel's civilians. Therefore it is in Israel's obligation and right to remove Arafat.\n\n \n Do they have the right? yes. should they? No. That is what we are debating, not whether or not they have the right. \n \n \nThere is a difference in these situations. You should do something about the \"bully\" which is what Israel would be doing by removing Arafat.\n Bad comparison.\n\n \n Good camparison, It would be stupid especially if the bully had friends and I was the hated one in the neighborhood, even if I had a big gun. \n \n \nYes but Arafat is assisting the attack of its citizens. How can Israel protect its citizens and leave Arafat alone if they are waiting for the international community to do something? \n\n \n You said yourself that Israel would be able to stop suicide bombers in the backlash. The point is this. Arafat, has been in power a long time and has the support of his people. If he were gone, another, which he would likely have been grooming, will take his place. Leaders in his position don't get there and not expect to die sometime. They prepare a successor. Eliminating him does not eliminate the problem, it just makes it worse. Because the same things will occur and you will have just riled up the folks. (as it were)\n \n \nIsrael is only in the same boat in that there are US resolutions that support the removal of Arafat. They are following up on these resolutions.\n It is not the same boat. The US had a multinational coalition to work in Iraq. Israel has the support of only two countries, one of which is the US, the other I am unsure of. \n \n \nFrom what evidence do you draw this conclusion? The US has always supported Israel, even in past Arab-Israeli wars.\n (I have stated my reasons of why the US would support Israel previously in the post.)\n\n \n Agreed, I think the US will likely support Israel. I think the US will be very angry and will give only minimal support if Israel flaunts the wishes of the US. Colin Powell has stated that the US does not support the removal of Arafat by Israel. NOte I said by Israel. \n \n \n\"the international community to rise against him\"...? \n Not so. You notice they did not call an \"urgent\" security council meeting when 19 people were killed in Haifa. They also did not call a meeting when Arafat stole 500 million dollars in aid money. \n The international community pays no attention to the wrong doings of Arafat and they can't be counted on to do something about it.\n\n \n Not immediately and not by force. The plan is a diplomatic one and it will take time. Your statistics only underline the lack of support Israel has in the international community. \n \n \nYou continue to grant immunity to a terrorist because he has support. I've covered the issue of war previously. I'm sure we will be discussing it further.\n Yes Israel would face a time of criticism but the world would move on as we must do. The US would stand by Israel as may some other countries who \"abstained\" (sp) from the security council resolution dealing with Arafat. \n\n \n Israel may have some supporters should it do this. However, you still do not solve the problem. It is naive to believe that Arafat is the driver of everything. It is Naive to bellieve that he has not prepared a successor. At some point, Israel will simply be at war with the palestinian people, and then their supporters. I do not support such an action.\n \n \nArafat would not be handled as a normal prisoner. He would most likely be allowed no phone calls than to his lawyer. All papers going back and forth between his lawyers would be checked for terrorist related activity. How would he then be able to direct his orginization. Trust me, precautions can be taken to prevent Arafat from in any way being involved with his orginizations. (These include freezing all assets).\n You assume that Israel has the power to freeze assets. Remember they are not the US and they do not have the support the US has for other countries to agree to the freezing of assets.\n \n \nStill your argument boils down to support. Israel cannot afford to not take actions against a terrorist who is responsible for murdering men women and children because of international support.\n\n \n Yes, my argument boils down to support. It also boils down to the fact that you do not solve the problem but rather make it worse.\n \n \nThe next few hundred (or even thousand) of people who are going to die because of people with links to Arafat do not have time for the international community to act.\n\n \n The thousands that will die in a war when you remove Arafat, then his successor and his successor and so on. The war will be with the palestinian people and their supporters. Yes, Israel will win. But the cost will be thousands of lives, mostly palestinian, but certainly israelis an syrians, and iranians, and egyptians, and saudi arabians, and perhaps americans or australians. And still the suicide bombings will continue. Nothing will have changed. except for the worse.\n \n Lastly, something for our judge. As for voting, it is obvious that the plan affirmed would not solve the problem posited by the affirmative. The risk to greater harm, outweighs any advantages. The advantages that are claimed do not exist.\n \n You must judge on the basis of life. Which plan risks greater life. It would be innappropriate to consider only the lives of the Israelis, as all people should be able to enjoy life. I have shown clearly that the risk of war exists. The loss of life on the palestinian side would be great. Not as great on the Israeli side but none the less significant.\n \n You must also judge on the efficacy of the plan. Will it work. Will the road map move forward? Will the suicide bombings stop? Nothing will change except to add a lot of resentment and even greater roadblocks should Arafat be removed by Israel. It is in a bad neighborhood. \n \n If the US and the remaining supporters of Israel could convince Arafat to step down then perhaps there would be support from the palestinian people to move forward.\n \n Lastly, we must look and see if there are alternatives that provide for less bloodshed. The affirmative has provided that by saying that the Israeli military could actually deal with even increased suicide bombings. I say do that and save a lot of heartache.\n \n I stand in negation of the idea that Arafat should be removed by Israel.\n \n Thanks to the judge. Thanks to my opponent. Poet, this has been a much more conducive debate for me with you. I think I prefer to engage you in a more highly structured form.\n \n End Post #6\n \n \n Always Stay Open Minded[/QUOTE]",

Please answer my origional question as it is relevant and the circumstances are almost the same.\n \n \n\n War may not be a likely result. i am willing to admit that. However it is a distinct possibility and any policy that potentiates it would need to consider it. You state that there would be an increase in suicide bombings and that Israel could step up security to prevent them. Well then. by all means do that now and there is no need to remove Arafat. The roadmap can continue and suicide bombers can be arressted and jailed.\n\n \n Prior to the removal of Arafat the following steps (and more) would need to be taken:\n An increase of a security forces around the border\n The closing of all entrances from Gaza - Israel and Westbank - Israel.\n (This would result in many Palestinians not able to go to work)\n \n These steps cannot be taken now because many Palestinians cross the daily to go to work.\n A time after the assasination of Arafat would be on the most high alert and bombings would be suspected, but day to day Israel cannot function like that.\n \n \nIsrael is surrounded by Arabs on all sides. Yes, the US would likely support Israel in a war, but may find it very difficult should they forcibly remove Arafat. I am not so certain that the US would support Israel. You provide no evidence to prove that we would, only that I provided no connection to Colin Powell's statements. Colin Powell did not go that far. However the absence of such a statement does not necessarily mean we would support Israel. The potential for a limited war in the region, particularly with Syria and Egypt and even possibly Saudi Arabia exists.\n\n \n The US supports Israel currently with millions and millions of dollars in aid. The US has always supported Israel in all of its past wars. This in part because of how our government (predominately Christian) feels religiously linked to Israel.\n I don't think that any Arab countries are willing to go to war with the Israel (+ United States supporting them) over Arafat. By now most Arab countries have learned their lesson from previous wars.\n \n \nAs stated above. War is not inevitable, but the possiblity is there and then we need to consider the consequences and what you are trying to accomplish with your plan. \n \n \n \n Yes but its extremely unlikely. With the plan to remove Arafat?\n I am trying to save lives. (Potentially millions)\n \n \n\n Do they have the right? yes. should they? No. That is what we are debating, not whether or not they have the right. \n \n \n They have an obligation to their citizens who will die as a result of Arafat remaining in power.\n \n \nGood camparison, It would be stupid especially if the bully had friends and I was the hated one in the neighborhood, even if I had a big gun. \n \n \n Bad comparison. We are talking about saving peoples lives. Remember you have the bigger friend and the bully's friends are certainly going to go to war over him.\n \n So instead of doing anything about the bully, you just sit back and let him pound your face in?\n \n \nYou said yourself that Israel would be able to stop suicide bombers in the backlash. The point is this. Arafat, has been in power a long time and has the support of his people. If he were gone, another, which he would likely have been grooming, will take his place. Leaders in his position don't get there and not expect to die sometime. They prepare a successor. Eliminating him does not eliminate the problem, it just makes it worse. Because the same things will occur and you will have just riled up the folks. (as it were)\n\n \n Eliminating him as well as seizing his millions that he has stolen from the Palestinian people and building houses with it will certainly aide the problem.\n Arafat is not control of who is successor is. I don't remember his name and I'm unable to locate the information on the internet but the potential succcessor was recently replaced. (Fox news)\n \n Even if he did the same could be said about Osama Bin Laden.\n \n \nAgreed, I think the US will likely support Israel. I think the US will be very angry and will give only minimal support if Israel flaunts the wishes of the US. Colin Powell has stated that the US does not support the removal of Arafat by Israel. NOte I said by Israel. \n \n \n \"Minimal support\"? First off war is not going to happen. Second the Us alreadys provides Israel with millions upon millions of dollars in aid. The aid would certainly increase. If the president really felt as if Israel might loose a war the aid would soar. \n \n \nNot immediately and not by force. The plan is a diplomatic one and it will take time. Your statistics only underline the lack of support Israel has in the international community. \n \n \n No one in their right mind trusted the UN to remove Saddam. No one in their right mind trusts the UN to remove Arafat. It simply will not happen.\n \n \nIsrael may have some supporters should it do this. However, you still do not solve the problem. It is naive to believe that Arafat is the driver of everything. It is Naive to bellieve that he has not prepared a successor. At some point, Israel will simply be at war with the palestinian people, and then their supporters. I do not support such an action.\n\n \n Osama is to the US what Arafat is to Israel.\n He is one of the most involved people on all fronts of terrorism in Israel.\n Certainly I do not think that removing Arafat is all that needs to be done to have peace. Its a step in the direciton of peace and along with eliminating other terrorist leaders it will put a huge dent in terrorism and the funding of terrorism.\n \n \n\n You assume that Israel has the power to freeze assets. Remember they are not the US and they do not have the support the US has for other countries to agree to the freezing of assets.\n\n \n It can be done. Arafat will not hear the word money and he will not speak it and therefore has no control over it.\n \n \nYes, my argument boils down to support. It also boils down to the fact that you do not solve the problem but rather make it worse.\n\n \n Removing a terrorist leader will make terrorist supporters angry. But in the end a terrorist leader is gone and lives are saved.\n \n \nThe thousands that will die in a war when you remove Arafat, then his successor and his successor and so on. The war will be with the palestinian people and their supporters. Yes, Israel will win. But the cost will be thousands of lives, mostly palestinian, but certainly israelis an syrians, and iranians, and egyptians, and saudi arabians, and perhaps americans or australians. And still the suicide bombings will continue. Nothing will have changed. except for the worse.\n\n \n You have yet to provide any reasons of why such a war will occur. \n \n \n \nI think I prefer to engage you in a more highly structured form.\n\n \n Agreed.\n \n P.S. I'm aware this isn't exactly the best post from me in this debate. I had forgotten to work on this over the weekend and thus I am in a rush to get it done. \n \n ---End Post #7---\n \n Thanks for reading this\n \n Always Stay Open Minded",

   "Silent Poet and DSA: Thanks for the debate and for judging. This is my final post. Silent Poet has one after this.\n \n Instead of responding specifically to SP's last post as it is somewhat disjointed, perhaps due to an upload error, I will provide a summary and some judging criteria as well as point out arguments missed and those attacked and respond as necessary.\n \n There are a number of points that I would like to make. The following is a quote from my previous post:\n \n \"Lastly, something for our judge. As for voting, it is obvious that the plan affirmed would not solve the problem posited by the affirmative. The risk to greater harm, outweighs any advantages. The advantages that are claimed do not exist.\n \n You must judge on the basis of life. Which plan risks greater life. It would be innappropriate to consider only the lives of the Israelis, as all people should be able to enjoy life. I have shown clearly that the risk of war exists. The loss of life on the palestinian side would be great. Not as great on the Israeli side but none the less significant.\n \n You must also judge on the efficacy of the plan. Will it work. Will the road map move forward? Will the suicide bombings stop? Nothing will change except to add a lot of resentment and even greater roadblocks should Arafat be removed by Israel. It is in a bad neighborhood. \n \n If the US and the remaining supporters of Israel could convince Arafat to step down then perhaps there would be support from the palestinian people to move forward.\n \n Lastly, we must look and see if there are alternatives that provide for less bloodshed. The affirmative has provided that by saying that the Israeli military could actually deal with even increased suicide bombings. I say do that and save a lot of heartache.\"\n \n Let us look at whether or not the problem is solved by the affirmative. The affirmative never responded to the concept that there would be other leaders to take the place of Arafat. He undoubtedly has been grooming other leaders to take his place. No leader with the stranglehold Arafat has that is looking at dieing would do otherwise. If Arafat is removed by whatever means, he becomes a martyr. The war Israel supposes would not likely involve the major powers. It would involve the Plestinian people and Israel. Syria is a potential. Would Israel win the war, without a doubt! However, will that solve the problem that Israel is trying to solve? \n \n The problem put forth by the affirmative is that there are suicide bombers coming out of palestine and Israel's citizens are being killed. Taking out Arafat and then cordoning off the palestinian people will not solve the problem because, as we see in Iraq, suicide bombers do not just come from Palestinian settlements. They come from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey, Iran, and a host of other countries. Removal of Arafat stokes up the problem and makes it last longer not shorten it.\n \n Can Israel achieve better or the same results another way. SP says:\n \n \"Prior to the removal of Arafat the following steps (and more) would need to be taken:\n An increase of a security forces around the border\n The closing of all entrances from Gaza - Israel and Westbank - Israel.\n (This would result in many Palestinians not able to go to work)\n \n These steps cannot be taken now because many Palestinians cross the daily to go to work.\n A time after the assasination of Arafat would be on the most high alert and bombings would be suspected, but day to day Israel cannot function like that.\"\n \n He states that an increase in security forces and closing of Gaza would have to occur BEFORE the removal of Arafat. He then goes on to say that it cannot be done now as only a time AFTER the assasination of Arafat would provide the necessary impetus to allow such an increase. This is CLEARLY a contradiction. It is a panicked attempt to argue the point that I made. Clearly, the security forces can be increased and the Gaza strip closed (as well as other necessary measures) NOW! This could occur for a few months to allow the international community to continue its pressure for peace. The closing of Israel's borders might allow for a cooling off period so that negotiations in earnest can begin. It is not a perfect plan, but it does clearly point to a less devastating way of dealing with the issue.\n \n Again, the issue of loss of life is necessary to look at. Silent Poet looks only at the loss of life on the Israeli side. If Arafat is the only real block for peace, do the palestinian people deserve the same chances at life? Of course they do. My opponent has never argued they don't. He states simply that no one will go to war because Israel has the backing of the US. \n \n Colin Powell was clear to Israel that we do not support the removal of Arafat by any means. While Israel is our ally and we have supported them for many many years in a very hostile territory, it is unlikely they would receive the military support to PREVENT any kind of uprising. Israel's military is more than adequate to respond. The problem is that the loss of life on the palestinian side would be enormous. The people support Arafat. They would respond to his ouster, whether it be assasination or arrest. I note also that Silent Poet, in his last post, seemed to abandon the idea of arrest as he discussed the security after Arafat's assassination. \n \n My statement earlier did seem to point to the idea that I did not think that Israel had the right to defend itself under UN resolutions. It is not what I inteded and I do think I corrected this with later posts. Israel absolutely has the right. However, Israel is not specifically named in the resolution. It is only one of the many referred to by \"any country\" or other general term. There is no UN resolution that says that ISRAEL should remove Arafat.\n \n My point all along is that Israel is the exact wrong entity to remove Arafat or to deal with his bullying tactics. My bully across the street is a perfect example although I think Silent Poet misses the point. He says, should I let myself be beat up? No, I should avoid the bully, find larger people who are my friends to hang with, ask an adult or teacher or police (someone who has the power and is removed from the situation) to deal with it. \n \n Again, the issues seem to be that the affirmative plan will not solve the problem. The burden of proof that it will is on the affirmative. I have shown alternatives that have a better chance succeeding as they provide a less violent method. Loss of life on all sides should be looked at not just Israel. The perspective must be global. The affirmative is very short sighted as well. The affirmative admits that the increased security could only be for a short time. The suicide bombers and muslim supporters of Arafat would just pick up where he left off and do so with vengence. If it can be longer then let the security be increased NOW citing the suicide bombings as the reason. Self protection is always preferrable to attack. Even if the attack is an act of self protection.\n \n I ask you to carefully consider, will the affirmative solve the problem? Will the advantages cited by the affirmative come about as a result of Israel's removal of Arafat? Is the problem significant enough to risk war (and no war is not definite, but there is a decided risk)? Is the problem significant enough compared to the problems that will be encountered afterwards? \n \n I think this debate rests in the areas of significance and solvency. I believe both sides have been topical and both would agree that there exists an inherent harm. One last comment that was not argued by the affirmative. If Arafat is a poor leader, why would you want to remove a poor leader of your enemy and replace him, potentially, with a good one?\n \n I stand in negation that Israel should remove Arafat.\n \n Thanks again for the debate Silent Poet. You have actually helped me to solidify my own thinking on this issue. DSADevil: After SP's next post it is in your hands. Thanks for judging. I look forward to hearing from both of you.",

   "Epaphras_faith,\n \n I'd like to start off apologizing for my being late on this post. But now, enough excuses. Let's get down to the issue.\n \n The issue: Should Israel remove Arafat?\n \n Removing simply means to remove him from power, by various means. I have stated that these means could be exile, arrest (with trial pending), or assassination which I favor over the three. \n \n Who is Arafat? (Biography in first post). Arafat is undeniably a terrorist. Arafat is to Israel, what Osama Bin Laden is to the United States.\n Why? \n Arafat is considered a figure head of terrorism by many Palestinians. Arafat founded and leads terrorist organizations.\n Arafat funds terrorism, putting millions and millions of dollars into the goal of killing innocent Israeli civilians.\n Arafat advocates terrorism. \n (\"But we ask Allah to grant us martyrdom, to grant us martyrdom. To Jerusalem we march - martyrs by the millions.\")\n \n Arafat is a terrorist. Along with the Israeli report on Arafat in 2002, the facts simply cannot be denied.\n \n Thus that is my argument. Terrorist's goal is to kill innocent people. Arafat is a terrorist and this is also his goal. He is responsible for the recent \"uprising\" over the past three years that have cost around 1,000 civilians their lives. \n Arafat does not want peace and therefore advocates the opposite. He is the leader of the Palestinian people and of equal power over the Palestinians as Sharon is to Israel. (If not more.)\n \n Keeping Arafat in power keeps him with power. What does he want to do with this power? He wants to use it to help murder Jews. \n Keeping him in his current position, continues to give him such power and thus results in the killing of innocent civilians.\n \n So if we are to remove Arafat then a terrorist is gone. A funder and advocator of terrorism is gone and a person who really wants peace can begin to take real steps to achieve it. \n Arafat continues to advocate terrorism, and takes no action against it. At least with Arafat gone the power of the security forces could be handed over to the current \"prime minister\" (such as Abbas) and he could take steps to renounce and dismantle terrorism.\n \n The non action against Arafat will result in terrorism. It is just the numbers. If it were up to him he would blow Jersualem sky-high. With the kind of power and aid he is given, it's not so far out of reach.\n \n How then can Israel continue to abide by the (anti-Israel) UN, when its civilians are being killed in the streets?\n The answer: They can't.\n \n My opponent argues:\n \n My opponent argues that Arafat should not be removed by Israel because of:\n 1. His support\n 2. The backlash of attacks against Israel\n 3. The world's disapproval of such action\n \n 1 + 3 are similar together so I will counter argue them together.\n \n It is absolutely true that Arafat has many supporters world-wide. Does this give Arafat the authority to continue to contribute to the murder of children? Absolutely not. The world does not understand Israel's situation because they are not in it or anywhere close to it (besides the US). Thus it really does not matter what they think. If Israel does not remove Arafat because of his supporters in the UN and throughout the world, then as a result more civilians will die. No country can allow this to happen and either can Israel.\n \n Negative Argument: \"What if instead of Israel removing Arafat, the UN did it?\"\n \n The UN? The same UN that allowed Iraq's civilians to stay in torture chambers? The same UN that passed a General Assembly resolution forbidding the removal of Arafat? With France's growing Muslim population and veto power in the UN, along with Russia, and Germany; the idea of the UN removing Arafat is hard to imagine. Even if it was possible it would take years and years for such a thing to happen. \n In the mean time you have thousands of Israeli men, women, and children being murdered and as a result casualties on the Palestinians side as an affect of Israel's retaliation. \n \n 2. A backlash?\n \n With the removal of any terrorist leader comes the angering of terrorists and thus a terrorist retaliation. So therefore of course Israel to expect counter attacks (suicide bombings), but extra steps can be taken to insure the least amount of casualties in the days following his removal. \n Two possible steps are:\n People sticking close to home and avoiding any kind of crowd. \n An increase in soldiers on the borders of Palestinian areas.\n Thus there are little to no casualties.\n But even if there were a substantial amount (20 - 100), isn't that much better than the thousands that will die if Arafat continues to stay in power? Yes of course it is!\n \n War?\n \n My opponent in this debate has suggested that war is a possible retaliation is Israel could face as a result of removing Arafat. An important thing to consider is that when I say \"remove Arafat' there are many different ways of doing this. Specifically I am arguing for arrest (with trial pending), assassination, or exile. \n Each option has its own degree of risk of retaliation. \n Assassination could probably expect the most while exile could probably expect the least. \n \n If Israel is to remove Arafat by one of those three methods is war (with Arab states) really a likely result?\n \n The answer is no.\n Since the foundation of the state of Israel there have been numerous Arab states aggressions. All of them have resulted in the victory of Israel and usually with the Arab states loosing land which has become a real factor in the conflict. \n Israel first off has the most superior technology and military. Arab states would be hesitant to attack Israel for fear of:\n 1. Loosing alliance with the US\n 2. Loosing land\n \n Also many Arab states (such as Saudi Arabia) are not too fond of Arafat. \n (Prince Bandar of Saudi Arabia [Speaking of Camp David offer] \"I If we lose this opportunity, its is not going to be a tragedy, it is going to be a crime\")\n Later (after Arafat turned down the deal) he remarked:\n \"I still have no recovered, to be honest with you, inside, from the magnitude of the missed opportunity that January\" \"Sixteen hundred Palestinians dead so far. And seven hundred Israelis dead. In my judgment, not one life of those Israelis and Palestinians dead is justified.\"\n \n Saudi Arabia is also dealing with its own terrorism and is trying to maintain relations with the US, despite the criticism from the media that they do not fight terrorism, but rather aid it.\n \n Jordan and Syria have both lost lands in past wars with Israel and I don't think they are up for loosing any more. \n \n Egypt has been on decent terms with Israel after gaining back land (lost in war) in exchange for recognizing Israel as a state.\n \n \n There are some other factors to consider why war is not a likely result.\n \n 1. Israel continues to have US support.\n The US has supported Israel in every one of its past wars and will continue to do so. With an ally like the US with many troops in the region, the US would be able to easily give air assistance (or possible troops) to Israel if needed.\n 2. Any such move by Arab states would hurt the Palestinian cause\n If the Arab states are seen as that aggressive (again) they will loose world support which, no Arab leaders really want. \n 3. Israel would be prepared.\n Unlike other wars which happened more as surprise attacks against Israel would be prepared for any aggression and thus much more likely to devour its enemies.\n \n With those factors it is very unlikely that any Arab country will seek to go to war with Israel over the exile of Arafat, and practically impossible for Arab states to build a coalition with other Arab states to attack Israel. \n \n \n \n Thus my conclusion: \n The obvious conclusion being that Israel's only choice is to remove Arafat one way or the other. If they do not it is only a matter of time that Arafat (with millions upon millions of dollars) is able to amount and supply terrorist organizations with more powerful bombs that would be capable of killing thousands of Israeli civilians. Israel cannot afford such a risk and inevitably. \n Arafat is just Osama in a different country killing different civilians. But he must not be treated any differently.\n \n I restate my position for the removal of Arafat by means of arrest (with trial pending), assassination, or exile. \n \n Thank you for the debate. I have truly enjoyed debating with you in a formal manner and may the best debater win.\n \n Dsadevil,\n \n Thanks for judging the debate. \n \n \n \n Thanks for reading this\n \n Always Stay Open Minded",

   "E-faith wins because silentpoet was late\n \n just kidding\n \n e-faith wins because silentpoet's arguments suck.\n \n kidding again.\n \n but i do negate (vote for e-faith). Here's why.\n \n Round comes down the backlash argument/mitigation of terrorism args. Both debaters seem to position the debate around the importance of human life. E-faith's big arg is that israel eliminating arafat would end up causing more problems than it solved, by sparking terrorism and removing world support. Silentpoets largest response is that this doesn't mean Israel doesn't have THE RIGHT to remove arafat, but this is ineffectual because E-faith points out he isnt disputing the legality (or at least doesn't think its pertinent), just saying its a bad choice. This leaves silentpoet in a tough position. He doesn't disprove or even attack e-faith's assertion that removing arafat would lead to more terror/deaths. His only surviving response is that Arafat needs to be removed simply because he's a terrorist, which outweighs the fact that removing him will cause more deaths.\n In all, I think that with both debaters framing the debate around human life, at the point where e-faith wins \"more life\" he wins the round. This is even clearer though, because he gives an alternate method of solvency for removing Arafat (the UN). This means he can get both life and no arafat. This is enough to negate.\n \n Good job to both. Silentpoet, i believe u won a round when ure opponent attacked based on issues that didnt impact back to the rez. You fell into the same trap here with the emphasis on Israel's RIGHT to take out Arafat. E-faith took it out very quickly, but u plugged away, and by the time you switched tactics, it was too late.",

   "Thanks to you both. It was an enjoyable debate. I did have problems continuing after the 7th post. We had already entered rebuttal at that point and the 8th post seemed redundant and unnecessary. \n \n I think 7 shortens it a bit and gives opportunity for correct rebuttal.\n \n SP: I did enjoy the formal debate and will endeavour to keep myself more formal in the informal debates. \n \n Great Debate!!\n \n Now we should send it to Arafat and Sharon and Bush!",

   "Dsadevil,\n \n I'm sorry but I feel I must really voice my disapproval of your judgement and your explination of it.\n \n \nBoth debaters seem to position the debate around the importance of human life. E-faith's big arg is that israel eliminating arafat would end up causing more problems than it solved, by sparking terrorism and removing world support. Silentpoets largest response is that this doesn't mean Israel doesn't have THE RIGHT to remove arafat, but this is ineffectual because E-faith points out he isnt disputing the legality \n \n \n This is false. I point out more than a few times that if Arafat continues to remain in power it WILL result in more deaths.\n \n \nThis leaves silentpoet in a tough position. He doesn't disprove or even attack e-faith's assertion that removing arafat would lead to more terror/deaths.\n\n \n I did say that removing Araft would cause a backlash, but that in the long run in would save more lives.\n \n \nHis only surviving response is that Arafat needs to be removed simply because he's a terrorist, which outweighs the fact that removing him will cause more deaths\n\n \n No its not. Perhaps I didn't illustrate it enough:\n \n SilentPoet:\"The next few hundred (or even thousand) of people who are going to die because of people with links to Arafat do not have time for the international community to act.\"\n \n SilentPoet: \"The obvious conclusion being that Israel's only choice is to remove Arafat one way or the other. If they do not it is only a matter of time that Arafat (with millions upon millions of dollars) is able to amount and supply terrorist organizations with more powerful bombs that would be capable of killing thousands of Israeli civilians. Israel cannot afford such a risk and inevitably.\"\n \n SilentPoet: \"You didn't seem to understand my point. Every minute that Israel does not act continues to put their citizens in danger. That gives Arafat another minute to complete his goal of the killing of Israel's civilians. That gives him another minute to authorize a shipment of arms, capable of killing thousands if not millions of civilians.\"\n \n SilentPoet: \"I understand the lack of support for such a move by Israel and its imminet backlash that it would result in, but not removing Arafat would result in far more casualties.\"\n \n \nThis is even clearer though, because he gives an alternate method of solvency for removing Arafat (the UN). This means he can get both life and no arafat. This is enough to negate.\n\n \n The alternative method as I pointed out would most likely never happen or if it were to happen it would take years, years which the next 1,000 people sitting down to eat dinner at a cafe cannot afford:\n \n SilentPoet: \"It is not likely that the world will ever support the removal of Arafat and it is certain that Arafat will try his best to accomplish the killing of the most possible civilians. \n I assure you no sane country would wait or could wait for the world to agree with the removal of such a person.\"\n \n SilentPoet: \"The UN? The same UN that allowed Iraq's civilians to stay in torture chambers? The same UN that passed a General Assembly resolution forbidding the removal of Arafat? With France's growing Muslim population and veto power in the UN, along with Russia, and Germany; the idea of the UN removing Arafat is hard to imagine. Even if it was possible it would take years and years for such a thing to happen. In the mean time you have thousands of Israeli men, women, and children being murdered and as a result casualties on the Palestinians side as an affect of Israel's retaliation.\"\n \n SilentPoet: \"My point being: Israel cannot afford to wait for the international community or Palestinians to take action against Arafat. Something like this would probably never occur and even if it did would take many years to process through. That gives Arafat the rest of his life to continue to support terrorists and terrorism. Another month waiting may very well mean mass casualties.\"\n \n \nand by the time you switched tactics, it was too late.\n\n \n What?",

Over the recent 3 year intifada (uprising) there have been over 1,000 Israeli civilian casualties (most being civilians). \n Is he suddenly just going to stop?\n \n No of course not. \n \n Its not an assertion it is a more than logical conclusion.\n \n \n--where on earth is the warrent in that (given in round)?\n\n \n Using past instances (Arafat stealing millions from aid) and the ship filled with explosives that was intercepted (On the way to Israel) it is acceptable to assume that Arafat will continue to fund and advocate terrorism. \n If the terrorists are ever able to get or create more effective ways of killing (such as 9/11 terrorists were) that will mean a larger amount of casualties. \n With someone pouring millions into terrorism it is only a matter of time before it happens.

   "keeping in mind, sp, that I agree with you in real life (I think he should be removed), I know the warrents that exist. But you didn't give them IN ROUND. You can't expect me to just create them for you, that's unfair to E-faith (as he might say \"arguing the round for you\"). I can only vote off what's presented to me, and the warrents weren't presented in-round.\n \n As for e-faith's args RE: backlash:\n \"The issue of support deterring ISRAEL from doing anything is because of the backlash. Syria has already expressed its willingness to attack Israel in response to attacks made by Israel in Syrian territory\n 1)http://www.drudgereportarchives.com...5004_flash4.htm\n 2) http://www.drudgereportarchives.com...rchFor%3Disrael \"\n \n Regarding comparative benefits, he says this (as a response to your claim that folks dont have time to wait for the int'l community to act)\n \"The thousands that will die in a war when you remove Arafat, then his successor and his successor and so on. The war will be with the palestinian people and their supporters. Yes, Israel will win. But the cost will be thousands of lives, mostly palestinian, but certainly israelis an syrians, and iranians, and egyptians, and saudi arabians, and perhaps americans or australians.

You never stated why you thought Arafat's successor would be better. My point was not just that war was a possibility but also that you don't solve the problem. It continues and is exacerbated by the removal of Arafat. It is all part and parcel of the same argument. I think your argument about war was well defended.\n \n If the terrorist attacks would end with the removal of Arafat, then perhaps the argument that the possibility of war is remote would have had more weight. But since I argued that the terrorist acts would continue and that it would actually increase with Arafat's successors, the possibility of war takes on new weight.\n \n I am not attempting to reargue the point but am trying to point out debate dynamics. AMD and I have both done competitive debate and have judged competitive debate. When looking at an argument one has to weigh the components intentionally for the judges. The one who lays out the connections clearly will likely win the argument (generally speaking). NOt that you didn't do well, just that you missed a connection or two. That is the crux of debating.

   "Thank you for the comments. You were also good and made me think about various implications removing Arafat would have. I am probably going to join one next year. I plan to join some extra cirriculum activities for college. \n \n Do you have any ideas for my question:\n\n \n 1) Structure your arguments in outline form. Use Roman numerals, letters, numbers etc. (Don't use too much detail). They provide markers for your opponents and the judge and make identifying missed arguments easier for you. \n \n 2) If you are uncertain to the meaning of an opponent, test it with an argument that is simple and somewhat nebulous. This invites attack as an easy target and gets your opponent to clarify his position to the point that you can likely pick a hole in the argument.\n \n 3) Test your arguments on yourself. See if you can poke holes in it. If you can, bet your opponent can. \n \n 4) Some arguments are rouses. They seemingly require you to respond in detail and with evidence when no evidence was offered to begin with. You wind up accepting the burden of proof when you shouldn't. You can simply state the opponent hasn't proven it. Make some simple pre-emptory statements with small amounts of evidence and then force them to hit it. If they don't you win the argument. If they do they will waste valuable time attempting to do what they should have done in the first place. However, if you get bogged down in it you will likely miss the vital argument that has weaker support but is possibly more verbose and looks harder to defeat.\n \n 5) Cover every argument every time. Give the judge some criteria to as to what the decision is based on. (In our case it was lives). It could be lives, money, societal decay, what have you.\n \n Those ought to get you firmly planted and probably kicking the pants off anyone on the site, given your already advanced state of ability.",
