All men and women are created equal in the eyes of the law. To suggest they are created equal physically is nonsense. Men can't give birth to children as that is a physical impossibility. All men are not created equal in mind and body. That is nonsense. They have the right to strive to be equal but beyond that nope.\n \n If we truly are to uphold these principles are not we then the citizens responsible to ensure that all men be cared for equally? That all people have a right to health, longevity, and well being?\n \n Your idea foundered on the rocks of reality.

Our evil fore fathers wrote a document that is our supreme law. In that document they set down certain rights not granted by men but by God. Sadly for the socialists or budding socialists among us health care is not a right found in that document nor in any pre existing rights. One can twist and spin but the right to health care is not there. Neither is the right to food. You are free to find food or work to buy it. But you have no right to have it given to you. The bottom line is not all men are created physically equal nor of the same health. As an old first sergeant once said, \"You live, you die, you smoke, you buy.\" The smoke in this case is health care.",

(Government, Politics & Diplomacy) (modifier) of, relating to, or promoting equality in social, economic, and political rights\n civil rights - definition of civil rights by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia.\n Civil rights Definition | Definition of Civil rights at Dictionary.com\n \n The True Meaning of \"Civil Rights\"\n by William Scott Dwyer\n \n The term \"rights\" first appeared in the American political context in 1776 in the Declaration of Independence, which referred to rights as \"unalienable\" and applying to \"all men,\" i.e., to all people (even though the founders didn't always practice what they preached), but the term \"civil rights\" did not appear until 1791, when it was used by Thomas Paine to whom it meant no less than what the term \"unalienable rights\" meant to Thomas Jefferson. \"Civil rights\", according to Paine, are based on the natural rights of every member of society. In his essay The Rights of Man, he states:\n \n \"Man did not enter into society to become worse than he was before, nor to have less rights than he had before, but to have those rights better secured. His natural rights are the foundation of all of his civil rights. . . . Natural rights are those which always appertain to man in right of his existence. . . . Civil rights are those which appertain to man in right of his being a member of society. Every civil right has for its foundation some natural right pre-existing in the individual, but to which his individual power is not, in all cases, sufficiently competent.\"\n Moreover, in \"A Serious Address to the People of Pennsylvania,\" Paine states that \"[w]henever I use the words freedom or rights, I desire to mean a perfect equality of them. \"It is this broad base, this universal foundation,\" he says, \"that gives security to all and every part of society.\" It is only an equality of rights that promotes harmony among human beings and inspires one person to defend the rights of another. If, as was true under Jim Crow and is true again today, I have less rights than you, because you are a beneficiary of mandatory racial and ethnic preferences, then why should I care about defending your rights? Your rights are not my rights. It is only the repeal of mandatory preferences and a return to equal rights that can foster a mutuality of interest among different ethnic groups within society. \n \n The term \"civil rights\" appeared in American law for the first time in the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which was designed to extend to blacks the same rights that whites already possessed. One of the principal sponsors of the Act described civil rights as \"the absolute rights of individuals, such as the right to personal security, the right of personal liberty and the right to acquire and enjoy property.\" Civil rights were thus construed not only to apply equally to every individual, irrespective of race or gender, but also to include the fundamental rights enunciated in the Declaration of Independence. The principle underlying liberty and property rights is that no one may gain values from others without their voluntary agreement -- that just as people have the right to associate with others by mutual consent, so they have the right to dissociate from others through personal choice. \n \n For instance, if two people of different races want to marry, a law against miscegenation would violate their civil rights, but so would a law compelling them to stay married, if either party wants a divorce. If two people of different races want to do business, a Jim Crow law preventing them would violate their civil rights, but so would a law compelling them to do business, if either party refuses. \n \n Thus, to force a black worker to labor for a white employer (as was done on the Southern plantations) would violate civil rights, but so would forcing a white employer to hire a black worker (as is done under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Acts). To threaten a business with closure for serving blacks (as was done under Jim Crow) would violate civil rights, but so would threatening a business with closure for refusing to serve blacks (as is done under Title II of the 1964 Civil Rights Acts). The proper function of government -- and the fundamental purpose of civil rights -- is to protect and defend freedom of choice, not violate it -- to protect people from being enslaved to others, not enslave people to others. \n \n If an owner or employer has liberty and property rights -- if he has rights to freedom of choice and freedom of association -- then he has the right to choose his employees and patrons on any basis he wishes, even one that is racially discriminatory. Although capitalism discourages invidious discrimination in the markeplace and would tend to create an economic system free of such discrimination, people still have the right to associate with, or dissociate from, anyone they choose, regardless of the person's race, religion, sex or national origin, and regardless of the reason for their choice. The right to dissociate from others, to be free from bondage to others -- which is clearly implied by the 13th Amendment -- does not mean that one is free to dissociate from another person only if one has a good, non-discriminatory reason for doing so. It means that one is free to dissociate from another person, irrespective of one's reasons for doing so. Freedom of choice does not apply only to choices that are deemed rational by the government, nor does it depend on the particular reasons for one's choice. All that matters is that one be free to choose.\n \n In fact, the practice of racial and gender preference by businesses and private universities is already sanctioned by law, even though it constitutes discrimination on the basis of race and gender and is technically in violation of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. This kind of private discrimination was recognized by a Supreme Court decision in which the Virginia Military Institute was barred from discriminating against women, if it continued to accept state funding. The implicit premise on which the Supreme Court based its decision is that discrimination is permissible in institutions that are privately funded but not in those that are publicly funded. Just as we allow private universities, like Notre Dame, to favor a particular religion but not public universities, so we allow private universities, like Mills College, to favor a particular gender, but not public universities. \n \n To be sure, this distinction is not adhered to consistently, given the practice of affirmative action in public institutions, but the principle is defensible nonetheless. The separation of race and state and of gender and state is as justifiable as the separation of church and state. By the same token, just as we do not deny parochial schools freedom of religion, neither should we deny businesses and private universities freedom of association and freedom of choice. If a private school or business has the right to discriminate in favor of a particular religion, then it should have the right to discriminate in favor of a particular race or gender.\n \n To allow a person the freedom to practice discrimination does not, of course, imply that one sanctions his conduct, any more than to allow him the freedom to express a racist viewpoint implies that one sanctions its content. Just as someone who opposes racist propaganda has no right under freedom of speech to ban it, so neither does someone who opposes racial discrimination have a right under freedom of association to ban it. The point is that one may not interfere with another person's freedom of choice simply because one disagrees with the way that he or she exercises that freedom. \n \n Defenders of the First Amendment often point out that the true test of one's belief in freedom of speech is whether or not one allows freedom for speech that one finds offensive. By the same principle, the true test of one's belief in freedom of association is whether or not one allows freedom for associations that one finds offensive (e.g., those based on racial discrimination). \n \n In fact, he who has no right to freedom of association -- no right to determine whom to associate with -- has no right to refrain from practicing racial discrimination, should the government decide to make such discrimination mandatory. It is just such mandatory discrimination to which the old miscegenation and separate-but-equal laws bear grim testimony, and of which the contemporary statutes on affirmative action and racial quotas are a modern expression. \n \n Observe that whereas the original intent of Title VII was to make racial discrimination illegal in private business, that statute has subsequently been interpreted to authorize affirmative action, making racial discrimination mandatory in private business. And this, despite assurances by proponent's of the statute that no such thing as quotas could ever be inferred from it. Consider, for example, the \"famous last words\" of Senator Hubert Humphrey when the Civil Rights Bill was being debated in Congress: \"Contrary to the allegations of some opponents of this title, there is nothing in it that will give any power to the Commission or to any court to require hiring, firing, or promotion of employees in order to meet a racial 'quota' or to achieve a certain racial balance....\" \n \n Even more outrageous is that affirmative action violates explicit disclaimers included in Title VII itself. Section 703 (j) reads as follows:\n \n \"Nothing contained in this title shall be interpreted to require any employer, employment agency, labor organization, or joint labor-management committee subject to this title to grant preferential treatment to any individual or to any group because of the race, color, religion, sex or national origin of such individual or group on account of any imbalance which may exist with respect to the total number of percentages of persons of any race, color, religion or sex, or national origin employed by any employer . . . .\"\n \n Once the government can violate freedom of association in order to prevent discrimination, it can do so in order to mandate discrimination, even to the point of perverting and explicitly transgressing its very own civil rights statutes! \n \n In addition to violating freedom of association, Title VII violates freedom of choice in the use of one's property. If the government may dictate the use of one's property, then the government is the true owner of the property, and you, merely its rightless, dispossessed custodian. The essence of ownership is the right of the owner to control his or her property (consistent with the right of others to control theirs). As the Supreme Court declared in 1917:\n \n \"Property is more than the mere thing which a person owns. It is elementary that it includes the right to acquire, use, and dispose of it. The Constitution protects these essential attributes of property.... There can be no conception of property aside from its control and use, and upon its use depends its value.\"\n \n Furthermore, without property rights no other rights are possible. If people have no right to control their own property, then they have no right to control their own lives, in which case, there can be no such thing as civil rights. People whose lives are at the behest of a higher authority do not act by right but only by permission. Nor are the interests of blacks and minorities any more secure under a government that can function as either friend or foe, depending on the winds of political change -- a government that can dole out favors or demand sacrifices on the premise that people's lives and property belong, not to themselves, but to the state.\n \n A person who has no right to control his own life and property is a slave -- a status that cannot be any more reassuring for blacks than for whites. As 19th Century liberal Auberon Herbert observed, \"no man can have rights over another man, unless he first have rights over himself.... and if we grant him the latter right, this is at once fatal to the former.\" (The Right and Wrong of Compulsion by the State and Other Essays, LibertyClassics, 1978, p. 46.)\n \n The \"right to enslave others\" -- to control their lives and property -- is, therefore, a self-contradiction. Quoting Rand:\n \n \"If some men are entitled by right to the products of the work of others [to the rightful property of others], it means that those others are deprived of rights and condemned to slave labor.\n \n \"Any alleged 'right' of one man, which necessitates the violation of the rights of another, is not and cannot be a right.\n \n \"No man can have a right to impose an unchosen obligation, an unrewarded duty or an involuntary servitude on another man. There can be no such thing as 'the right to enslave'.\" (\"Man's Rights\", The Virtue of Selfishness, p. 96.)\n \n If a black business owner prefers the company of black employees but is forced to hire members of other ethnic groups in order to avoid charges of racial discrimination, then he is deprived of freedom of choice and freedom of association, the very rights that black workers were deprived of in being forced to labor for white employers.\n \n This does not mean, of course, that the violations of civil rights inflicted on business owners today compare in severity or degree to those inflicted on blacks centuries earlier. But it does mean that these latter day violations entail a rejection of the same principle of individual autonomy as did slavery in the antebellum South. George Santayana observed that those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. It is equally true that those who cannot grasp fundamental principles are condemned to repeat their violation. \n The True Meaning of \"Civil Rights\"",

The AANA is asking the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and Congress to work together to reverse anesthesia payment cuts for all anesthesia providers and restore fair anesthesia payment. And we urge the public to join with us.\"\n \n AANA - 083107 -- GAO Report Confirms: Medicare Underpays for Anesthesia Services \n\n \n \n\n An important study by the actuarial firm, Milliman finds that Medicare underpays hospitals by $34.8 billion and physicians by $14.1 billion, while Medicaid underpays hospitals by $16.2 billion and physicians by $23.7 billion. These amounts are made up for by commercial payers, resulting in 18% greater costs for private carriers for hospital services and 12% for physician services.\n http://www.john-goodman-blog.com/cost-shifting-government-vs-the-uninsured/ \n\n \n The fact is that the insured have been subsidizing Medicare, Medicaid and the uninsured. That's why the costs are so high!\n \n\n And how is it uncle sam's fault when the very health insurance companies regulate what cost's what and whom they can choose to insure and for how much? Even now the two biggest insurance companies in Connecticut have merged once again giving consumers even less choice in the matter...\n\n \n See above.",

A civil right is normally in the constitution for the US and is a restriction on government intrusion in your life or restriction on your life. For example the 14th amendment does offer some civil rights including life, liberty, and property. All of those can be taken away with due process of the law as stated. You can be executed, you can be thrown in jail, and you can have property seized as evidence all with due process of law (aka a trial or something like that). \n \n So now, does a civil right mean you are guaranteed this by the government? I'd say no. You aren't guaranteed a piece of property from the government. You are guaranteed the right to have that property if it is yours unless due process takes it away. Same with health care. You have the right to get health care but you don't you aren't guaranteed health care.",

You have the right to pursue it. \n \n The HC crisis is a manufactured one to support a takeover of 1/6 of our economy and you bought into it.\n \n http://www.cato.org/pubs/bp/bp101.pdf\n \n By: Richard G. Fessler, MD, PhD\n \n The media and political community have made a big deal out of the fact that the U.S. ranks 37 out of 191 countries on the World Health Organization's Health Care Ranking System. Is this tool a credible way to compare quality health care delivered in the U.S. vs the rest of the world? \n Let's be perfectly clear about this, the United States Health Care is second to none! Ask the tens of thousands of patients who travel internationally to the US every year for their health care. As an example of the quality of health care delivered in the US, Americans have a higher survival rate than any other country on earth for 13 of 16 of the most common cancers. Perhaps that is why Belinda Stronach, former liberal member of the Canadian Parliament and Cabinet member (one of the health care systems touted as \"superior\" to the US) abandoned the Canadian Health Care system to undergo her cancer treatment in California.1 \n \n But to understand how WHO derives this misleading statistic, which has been ballyhooed widely by both the media and politicians alike, you need to understand how it is created. WHO's health care rankings are constructed from five factors each weighted according to a formula derived by WHO. These are: \n \n 1. Health Level: 25 percent\n \n 2. Health Distribution: 25 percent \n \n 3. Responsiveness: 12.5 percent\n \n 4. Responsiveness Distribution: 12.5 percent\n \n 5. Financial Fairness: 25 percent \n \n \"Health level\" is a measure of a countries \"disability adjusted life expectancy\". This factor makes sense, since it is a direct measure of the health of a country's residents. However, even \"life expectancy\" can be affected by many factors not related to health care per se, such as poverty, homicide rate, dietary habits, accident rate, tobacco use, etc. In fact, if you remove the homicide rate and accidental death rate from MVA's from this statistic, citizens of the US have a longer life expectancy than any other country on earth.2 \n \n \"Responsiveness\" measures a variety of factors such as speed of service, choice of doctors, and amenities (e.g. quality of linens). Some of these make sense to include (speed of service) but some have no direct relationship to health care (quality of linens). These two factors at least make some sense in a ranking of health care, but each is problematic as well. \n \n The other three factors are even worse. \"Financial fairness\" measures the percentage of household income spent on health care. It can be expected that the \"percentage\" of income spent on health care decreases with increasing income, just as is true for food purchases and housing. Thus, this factor does not measure the quality or delivery of health care, but the value judgment that everyone should pay the same \"percentage\" of their income on health care even regardless of their income or use of the system. This factor is biased to make countries that rely on free market incentives look inferior. It rewards countries that spend the same percentage of household income on health care, and punishes those that spend either a higher or lower percentage, regardless of the impact on health. In the extreme then, a country in which all health care is paid for by the government (with money derived from a progressive tax system), but delivers horrible health care, will score perfectly in this ranking, whereas a country where the amount paid for health care is based on use of the system, but delivers excellent health care will rank poorly. To use this factor to justify more government involvement in health care, therefore, is using circular reasoning since this factor is designed to favor government intervention. \n \n \"Health Distribution and Responsiveness Distribution\" measure inequality in the other factors. In other words, neither factor actually measures the quality of health care delivery, because \"inequality of delivery\" is independent of \"quality of care\". It is possible, for example, to have great inequality in a health care system where the majority of the population gets \"excellent\" health care, but a minority only gets \"good\" health care. This system would rank more poorly on these measures than another country that had \"equal\", but poor, health care throughout the system.\n Popular Ranking Unfairly Misrepresents the U.S. Health Care System : Smart Girl Nation\n Carroll: U.S. health care is not inferior - The Denver Post\n 37th in Health Performance? | FactCheck.org",

   "Meh and it's all based upon personal opinion too you know..\n\n \n All you need to do is check the political affiliation of the professors teaching the journalists. It reads like a \"Who's Who in the Leftwing\". ;)\n \n\n Do Journalism Schools Need More Conservatives?\n 2009 May 13\n According to its website, there are 32 full-time professors at the University of Oregon School of Journalism and Communication. According to Lane County voting records, none of them are Republicans. Twenty-six are registered Democrats, one is non-affiliated and five don't return results in the voter database. If you add in adjuncts, there are 38 total Democrats and two Republicans, both of whom teach technical subjects. You could walk into a head shop in Berkeley and find a bigger conservative presence.\n \n The disparity, as dramatic as it is, mirrors the the political composition of many other journalism schools across the country. A 2005 study of nine top journalism schools by David Horowitz and Joseph Light revealed similar ratios of political affiliation. Columbia University had 15 Democrats and one Republican, while Berkeley had ten Democrats and zero Republicans.\n According to a study performed by UO economist Bill Harbaugh in 2006, there are 15:5 registered Democrats in the total UO faculty for every one Republican. The Oregon Daily Emerald reported that 96% of contributions during the 2008 election cycle went to Democratic candidates; in 2004 the figure was 100%.DanLawton.com | Do Journalism Schools Need More Conservatives? \n\n \n\n Yeah I guess begging for money would make you biased to your biggest supporters\n \n\n You know it. \n \n\n I don't doubt about Mr. Rodgers but hey you know what they say bout birds with big feet...

   "is health or rather the care of someone, and their family a matter of civil rights?\n\n No, calling health care a \"right\" is a perversion of the term and demonstrates a disconnect from the founding principles of this nation.\n \n \nIs not a person entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness?\n\n Entitled?\n \n \nAnd if all men are created equal should it thus be so that all men have the equal right to then be sound in mind and body as well?\n\n I think that is a discussion better left to theologians. When left to politicians the outcome is more often cattle cars and killing fields than warm, cozy healthy citizens.\n \n \nIf we truly are to uphold these principles are not we then the citizens responsible to ensure that all men be cared for equally? That all people have a right to health, longevity, and well being?\n\n Does anyone have an enforceable right to not be assaulted, injured or murdered? (I'm not talking tort, I'm discussing constitutional)\n \n \nIs this not what the current health care debate SHOULD be about? Should it be more of a matter of upholding these principles\n\n Principles? Are these principles you speak of articulated in any treatise or statement of political philosophy?\n \n \nI look forward to peoples answers on whether you think Health and the care and ability to ensure that is a matter of civil rights...\n\n I consider the notion an affront to liberty and the fundamental principles this nation was founded on. That's not a statement on whether I believe universal health care isn't a just and humanitarian endeavor, only that in calling it a right you insult, injure and denigrate what rights are . . . At least as embraced by our founding fathers and formulated and enshrined in our Constitution. As such, declaring rights to health care, prescriptions, a living wage, affordable housing, Internet access etc, etc, etc, are a danger to the Constitution.\n \n \nIf what you say is true then by your notion that all men are created equal to pursue life is therefore false and void.. Perhaps it is in the definition of life itself that we should look.\n \n Is it only thus in life as in birth? Survival? Or maintaining one's life that all men are equal or thus should be? \n\n The right to life is the right to not have your life arbitrarily ended by government. It, along with all fundamental rights is a negative right; an exception of power, what the government shall not do to you. You are arguing from the realm of positive rights, (what government must do on your behalf), they are not represented in our form of government and are considered \"second generation\" rights. \n \n They have their genesis in the Russian Revolution and the advent of social, cultural and economic \"rights.\" As such, they have no place in a discussion of the obligations of the US government operating under the Constitution. \n \n I should add that the fact that \"positive rights\" are not represented in the Constitution is considered by Obama to be a fundamental defect of the Constitution and the establishemnt of positive rights in our constitutional system is the centerpiece of his goal of economic re-distribution. So you may get your wish (when the revolution is over).\n \n \nIf our country is about opportunity how then would it be possible for that person to pursue the overall happiness and liberties endowed upon him if he is then not entitled to life and the maintaining thereof? \n\n \n Rights are not entitlements. The possession of a right does not create a mandate to have a service or commodity provided to you. Believing it does is a insult and perversion of the concept of rights (at least as embraced by the founders/framers).\n \n \nI feel that it is not only our moral obligation to ourselves and to ensure that our children and the following generations after us look upon us through histories piercing and weighing glance and see that we took it upon ourselves to do something to endow and empower more of our fellow citizens with the one inalienable right that cannot be bought and cannot have a price put upon it the maintaining of one's life in order to pursue their happiness through the liberties provided to them and their families..\n\n \n So much wrong with that sentence (and I'm ignoring the grammar emoticon_rolleyes)\n \n Rights have very little to do with what one perceives to be their (or society in general) moral obligations. Rights are concepts that focus on the actions of government and in the case of the US Constitution, usually represent exceptions of powers never granted to the government. In other words, they are redundant prohibitions (a fact which was a primary argument against adding a bill of rights to the constitution).\n \n And most egregious of all, liberty is not provided to you. Liberty is retained by citizens by not conferring to government every speck of sovereignty and self determination.\n \n \nSuch is my belief in context to the three inalienable rights that we are endowed. Life in itself must be maintained, and it in my mind is a most precious right that thus must be tended to.\n\n If you wish to frame this in inalienable rights then your argument is illogical bordering on idiotic. You are arguing for the placement of the care of one's life in the government's hands - that is the ultimate antithesis to the concept that one's life is an inalienable right emoticon_confused :xbanghead.\n \n \nWe must take it upon ourselves to set right and heal and care for all our citizens. It is not a question of rights in my opinion, but a moral obligation.\n\n Well then just rescind the OP and we can discuss this within those parameters (which you have unfortunately already dismissed in your conversation with JP in 31; \"This is an endeavor not of a voluntary nature but an effort to fix a crumbling system that is bankrupting and jeopardizing the health and well being of a majority of Americans.\")",
