But I don't know that the 2nd one is so much a lie. I think there is definitely evidence that suggests a gentic basis. I think the real question is whether that really matters or not. To argue gay rights on the basis of genetics requires the premise that we are slaves to our genetics, unable to make our own descisions. And I don't think that is the case at all about many things in life. It's not like genetics requires us to have sex. So yes, there may well be a genetic influence in homosexuality--there is a genetic influence in much of human behavior. But does that really matter? No. And it certainly has no bearing on the moral question.\n \n \nto me, the battle is being fought on the wrong field, with the wrong tactics\n\n \n That's because gay pride people want to define the debate. That's what they are trying to do. That's why they insist on talking only about the innate aspect of homosexuality rather than the behavioral.

   "Having a different interpretation doesn't make one a liar. To you it is very plain, to others not so plain, or for others, the Bible clearly does not refer to homosexuality at all or supports homosexuality. Perhaps more of society is interpreting in a neautral or supportive way today. In the past, when being anti-gay was more acceptable, the Biblical scriptures were interpreted as being anti-gay by more people. I don't know that you can attribute these other interpretations to people who are highly politicized gay rights supporters. Sure, many are, but that may be too facile a generalization in 2005, because of the great deal of societal support gay people have.\n\n reading something and saying that it says something else makes you a liar. if i write something, and you interpret what i wrote differently to what i originally meant, the you are falsely representing my staements, and that makes you a liar. the bible clearly refers to homosexuality as a sin and an abomination.\n \n i really like the way you weave the not-so-taboo status about homosexuality into your posts. are you saying that because nowadays homosexuality is more widely accepted, that the meaning of the bible should change to be more politically correct in these times? listen, jake, society changes. what is acceptable, normal, fashionable, taboo, cool, gross, or lame changes like nearly every day. that is the nature of society. this has NOTHING to do with the bible. the bible does not and should not change to accomodate the constantly shifting paradigms in society. the bible says what it says. live and let live.\n \n \nI think most of the population believes being gay, like being straight, is not a conscious choice. \n\n and what? what does this have to do with reality? do i need to mention what most of society though about the shape of the world in columbus' day? do i have to mention what most of the population believed in the middle ages?\n \n just the facts, please\n \n \nThere are bound to be lobbyists on both sides of the debate, for and against gay marriage, representing various religions. I agree that any claim to proof of a biological link will not strengthen the case. As this change in society occurs, people will realize that it doesn't matter. Gay people will be accepted as part of the wider community, and no one will care about the choice or biology issue, anymore than they would care about such issues when it comes to straight people. In Canada, where gays have equity with straights, this issue very rarely comes up, if at all.\n\n i suppose you could look at it that way. regardless, no such proof exists. and it isnt likely that any will ever be found\n \n homosexuality, by definition, is a sexual attraction or intimacy between people of the same sex. this is either a feeling or a behavior, or both. i dont know if you know this, but feelings and causes of behavior in humans are pretty much beyond the scope of science. they are intangible, and impossible to observe or verify objectively. so when we say we are looking for scientific evidence that can support the origin and cause of a feeling or behavior, then we are on a unicorn hunt",

   "I don't take every word of the Bible to be true.:)\n \n Interestingly, neither does the Catholic Church... \n\n Catholic Church no longer swears by truth of the Bible\n The hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church has published a teaching document instructing the faithful that some parts of the Bible are not actually true. \n \n The Catholic bishops of England, Wales and Scotland are warning their five million worshippers, as well as any others drawn to the study of scripture, that they should not expect \"total accuracy\" from the Bible. \n \n \"We should not expect to find in Scripture full scientific accuracy or complete historical precision,\" they say in The Gift of Scripture. \n \n The document is timely, coming as it does amid the rise of the religious Right, in particular in the US. \n \n Some Christians want a literal interpretation of the story of creation, as told in Genesis, taught alongside Darwin's theory of evolution in schools, believing \"intelligent design\" to be an equally plausible theory of how the world began. \n \n But the first 11 chapters of Genesis, in which two different and at times conflicting stories of creation are told, are among those that this country's Catholic bishops insist cannot be \"historical\". At most, they say, they may contain \"historical traces\". \n \n The document shows how far the Catholic Church has come since the 17th century, when Galileo was condemned as a heretic for flouting a near-universal belief in the divine inspiration of the Bible by advocating the Copernican view of the solar system. Only a century ago, Pope Pius X condemned Modernist Catholic scholars who adapted historical-critical methods of analysing ancient literature to the Bible. \n \n In the document, the bishops acknowledge their debt to biblical scholars. They say the Bible must be approached in the knowledge that it is \"God's word expressed in human language\" and that proper acknowledgement should be given both to the word of God and its human dimensions. \n \n They say the Church must offer the gospel in ways \"appropriate to changing times, intelligible and attractive to our contemporaries\". \n \n The Bible is true in passages relating to human salvation, they say, but continue: \"We should not expect total accuracy from the Bible in other, secular matters.\" \n \n They go on to condemn fundamentalism for its \"intransigent intolerance\" and to warn of \"significant dangers\" involved in a fundamentalist approach. \n \n \"Such an approach is dangerous, for example, when people of one nation or group see in the Bible a mandate for their own superiority, and even consider themselves permitted by the Bible to use violence against others.\" \n \n Of the notorious anti-Jewish curse in Matthew 27:25, \"His blood be on us and on our children\", a passage used to justify centuries of anti-Semitism, the bishops say these and other words must never be used again as a pretext to treat Jewish people with contempt. Describing this passage as an example of dramatic exaggeration, the bishops say they have had \"tragic consequences\" in encouraging hatred and persecution. \"The attitudes and language of first-century quarrels between Jews and Jewish Christians should never again be emulated in relations between Jews and Christians.\" \n \n As examples of passages not to be taken literally, the bishops cite the early chapters of Genesis, comparing them with early creation legends from other cultures, especially from the ancient East. The bishops say it is clear that the primary purpose of these chapters was to provide religious teaching and that they could not be described as historical writing. \n \n Similarly, they refute the apocalyptic prophecies of Revelation, the last book of the Christian Bible, in which the writer describes the work of the risen Jesus, the death of the Beast and the wedding feast of Christ the Lamb. \n \n The bishops say: \"Such symbolic language must be respected for what it is, and is not to be interpreted literally. We should not expect to discover in this book details about the end of the world, about how many will be saved and about when the end will come.\" \n \n In their foreword to the teaching document, the two most senior Catholics of the land, Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, Archbishop of Westminster, and Cardinal Keith O'Brien, Archbishop of St Andrew's and Edinburgh, explain its context. \n \n They say people today are searching for what is worthwhile, what has real value, what can be trusted and what is really true. \n \n The new teaching has been issued as part of the 40th anniversary celebrations of Dei Verbum, the Second Vatican Council document explaining the place of Scripture in revelation. In the past 40 years, Catholics have learnt more than ever before to cherish the Bible. \"We have rediscovered the Bible as a precious treasure, both ancient and ever new.\" \n \n A Christian charity is sending a film about the Christmas story to every primary school in Britain after hearing of a young boy who asked his teacher why Mary and Joseph had named their baby after a swear word. The Breakout Trust raised \u00a3200,000 to make the 30-minute animated film, It's a Boy. Steve Legg, head of the charity, said: \"There are over 12 million children in the UK and only 756,000 of them go to church regularly. \n \n That leaves a staggering number who are probably not receiving basic Christian teaching.\" \n http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,13509-1811332,00.html",

I guess it's nerves that make you feel good, rather than you actually being attracted to your hand or a black stick.;) Then we need to draw a line between purely physical 'love' (e.g., a prostitute) and the 'love' you feel for someone, not just their body. That line is fuzzy though.\n\n this brings us back to square 1: how do we determine someone's sexual orientation? hormonal levels are the result of sexual arousal, and sexual arousal can be achieved by lots of different methods that dont necessarily indicate sexual orientation. a person's level of arousal is useless to determine their sexual orientation. the only thing that can be used to determine someone's sexuality is either their claims (which we have already seen is also meaningless scientifically) or their observable physical behavior. so, if such a thing as sexual orientation even exists, how can it be determined?\n \n \nAll this is true and I agree with it, but my point is you didn't consciously choose to be sexually attracted to her; you just were after a while. There was no conscious decision on your part.\n\n how do you reconcile this with reality? how do the one-night-stand participants sudenly lose their sexual attraction? is it that they are programmed that way? or is it a reflexive or automatic mechanism? and if this is the case, how come they sometimes find someone that they stay in a long-term relationship with? what about the case of married people? how would a faithful married man be totally immune to another woman's obvious flirting with him? how can he consciously determine to remain faithful and not succumb to cheating, to the point where he doesnt even allow himself to be turned on by other women? and what about the cheating man, who's sexual arousal for his affair partner suddenly increases, while he gradually shows less afection to his wife, even though she is doing the exact same things that used to arouse him before?\n \n these are choices. your sexual attraction towards individuals can be consciously switched on and off. unless you have a better explanation",

   "It doesn't. There is a debate about it. The concept of homosexuality wasn't understood as it is today, when the Bible was written, just like many other things. We are attempting to read our modern understanding back and make it apply to their understanding. I don't deny that can cause problems for BOTH sides of the debate on homosexuality and the Bible.\n\n please enlighten me. what exactly about the concept of homosexuality today is different or better understood than in the time that the old testament was written?\n \n \nLook at Mr. Write LA's article, which he got to post before I did. The anti-semitic(it was once used to persecute Jews) and the misogenistic Biblical God is no longer cool in this society, so the Catholic Church is no longer interested in those parts. The Bible has at times been used to support slavery. It's been used to persecute gay people when that has been cool or not used so much when that wasn't such a bandwagon to jump on in society as well.\n\n pardon my utter annoyance, but who the heck cares!!! the catholic church does not determine what the bible means. and worse, any religion that changes its doctrine just to be \"cool\" in society's eyes is a garbage religion. you know what, to clear up your confusion, ease your anxiety about the church's stance, and find reconciliation, why dont you write your own bible, in which the god of that bible endorses homosexuality. then start your own church and preach whatever you like.\n \n the bible is still being used to oppress the poor, encourage blind obedience to the head of the state, endorse capitalism and resist the advancement of science. nothing in the bible will change or should change just because society determines what is \"cool\". it is utter nonsense to want your lifestyle to be in accordance with an old man-made book that talks about a man-made god, insomuch that you need to twist the book's words and perform doctrinal acrobatics so that it says what you want it to say.\n \n isnt it funny how the biggest thrust of the gay movement is \"tolerance\"? their mantra is, \"if its not harming anybody, then let it be\". yet when it comes to the doctrine of bible-based religions, gays are the first ones to try to disrupt and interfere with the believer's lifestyle. if a pastor and congregation believes that god disapproves of homosexuality, and they believe that homosexuals are going to hell, does that really bother gays that much? do gays really think that the god that they dont believe in will send them to a place they dont believe in because its written in a book they dont believe in? if such is the case, why should they care? and if they dont believe in what religion preaches, how is religion harming anybody any more than hoosexual behavior is harming anybody?\n \n listen, stop begging for the church's approval. now we have gay biblical apologetists. who wouldve thunk it.",

It completely doesn't understand gay sexuality. \n\n this is called doctrinal acrobatics and semantic games\n \n \nCan't I just ignore certain things, or have a different interpreation as with stoning non-virgin brides and children, and gender roles, and the ant-Semetic parts? Well, of course I can. I don't necessarily have to write a whole new Bible, that has absolutely no resemblance to the older version.\n\n i dont see why you cant ignore the bible completely, or partially, abide by the laws that you are comfortable with, and disregard those you dont agree with. unlike laws of the state, there are no physical consequences to disobeying a biblical law, so why should there be an issue\n \n at the same time, it is a lie to say that the laws of the bible are not what the bible says they are. i have no problem with you ignoring or downright diregarding the entire bible, but please dont lie and say something is there that isnt\n \n \nIt's not just gays who are questioning certain things in relation to homosexuality and religion and the Bible.\n\n the bible says what the bible says. question answered\n \n \nIt's not tolerating intolerance. I don't think any religion could force something on another religion. There are those within the \"traditional\" religion, who are questioning the homophobia within their religions, no matter what the official line is from the authorities. These changes are happening in the broader society, and religion will not be immune, unless it isolates itself. We'll see how far society goes in accepting gays. The more it does, the more pressure there will be on some religions, to rethink their beliefs about gays, so as not to become isolated and considered irrelevent. Gays and straight supporters are a part of all these religions, and the wider society, and none of those people are going away, and I don't think they will be silent. These religions are based on beliefs, and there are people who don't want to believe their God or their Bible is anti-gay. This could be a positive evolution of beliefs, it doesn't have to be put in a negative context. Freedom of religion issues may enter in, as there are religious groups who want to legally marry gays as well as straights.\n\n theres nothing wrong with starting your own religion based on ideals that youd like to live by and see your friends live by. however, theres something wrong with deceiving people into thinking that a newly invented variant religion is supported by the bible if it isnt. the bible makes it clear that ALL sin is displeasing to god. and it makes it clear tha homosexuality is among these sins.\n \n the whole issue of religion, as jyoshu pointed out, is a red herring. it is a distraction from the main issue of gay rights, and is getting the gay community nowhere fast. when it comes to marriage, the church is optional. furthermore, if god exists and his demeanor is as described in the bible, then asking god to bless a gay union is an exercise in futility. the bible was written tousands of years ago, and was finalized then, with no room for editions or revisions. whatever it says is what will remain for as long as it exists. please do not tamper with it. write your own bible, invent your own god, and bless your gay unions in accordance with it if you so desire. in my experience, church marriages have no correlation to marriage strength or longevity. but hey, its a free country",

They are both part of the Old Testament Holiness Code, a religious, not a moral code; it later became the Jewish Purity Laws. [\"Abomination\" is used throughout the Old Testament to designate sins that involve ethnic contamination or idolatry. The word relates to the failure to worship God or to worshiping a false god; it does not relate to morality.] Professor Soards tell us, \"Old Testament experts view the regulations of Leviticus as standards of holiness, directives for the formation of community life, aimed at establishing and maintaining a people's identity in relation to God.\"B-4 This is because God was so determined that his people would not adopt the practices of the Baal worshipers in Canaan, and same-gender sex was part of Baal worship. (The laws say nothing about women engaging in same-gender sex; probably this had to do with man's dominance, and such acts by the subservient had nothing to do with religious impurity.)\n \n God required purity for his worship. Anything pure was unadulterated, unmixed with anything else These Purity Laws prohibited mixing different threads in one garment, sowing a field with two kinds of seed, crossbreeding animals. A few years ago in Israel when an orthodox government came into power, McDonalds had to stop selling cheeseburgers. Hamburgers, OK. Cheese sandwiches, OK. But mixing milk and meat in one sandwich violated the Purity Laws--it had nothing to do with morality. These were laws about worshipping God, not ethics, and so have no bearing on our discussion of morality. Helmut Thielicke remarks on these passages: \"It would never occur to anyone to wrench these laws of cultic purification from their concrete situation and give them the kind of normative authority that the Decalogue, for example, has.\"B-5\n \n Another reason they are not pertinent to our discussion is that these laws were for the particular time and circumstances existing when they were given. If you planted a fruit tree, you could not eat its fruit until its fifth year, and all fruit the fourth year must be offered to the Lord. A worker must be paid his wage on the day of his labor. You must not harvest a field to its edge. We readily dismiss most of them as not applicable to our day and culture, and if we dismiss some of them for any reason, we have to dismiss all of them, including the sexual regulations, for that same reason.\n \n When we add the fact that these laws were talking about heterosexuals, it makes three reasons, any one of which would be sufficient, why they have no bearing on questions about homosexuals or homosexuality or on the morality of same-gender sex by homosexuals today.",
