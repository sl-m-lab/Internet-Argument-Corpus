The more we place biblical creationism next to every other religion's creation story, the less and less it will appear believable. There's a damn good reason why the supporter of TTC don't want other religions included. IMO, it's far easier to compare to fact free religious origin stories to disprove both then to educate people to how science actually works. I'm starting to lean to Daewoo's belief that America is essentially screwed as science isn't something many understand.",
