This figure then rises dramatically to up to 40% for 23 weeks, upto 70% at 24 weeks etc. Of those that are born on or before week 24, 50%+ will have severe chronic disablities, mainly associated with the brain and lungs.\n \n \nWho gets to make the decision to murder that emerging life?\nPlease keep on topic.

   "What kind of person wants to defend the indefensable. Abortion is murder in 99% of the cases.\n\n \n Oh for gods sake. Let's at least try and deal with the facts, please? Murder is a killing which is against the law. Abortion, like killing in self defense, state sanctioned execution, and killing in times of war, is a legal form of killing. It certainly isn't murder. Murder has a very specific definition, and abortion isn't there.\n \n \nWhat is wrong in your mind that makes you think that murdering unborn children is a healthy activity?\n\n \n It's all relative, my man. What's wrong with your mind that makes you think restricting peoples power to control their own bodies is a healthy activity?\n \n See how it switches around so easily? What I think is right and wrong will clearly be very different to what you think. The difference is that, except where our desires openly clash, such as on this issue, I won't try and tell anyone else that what they think is wrong. Unlike most pro-lifers, who insist that they are right and that the pro-choicers are wrong.\n \n \nYou pro-choicers don't think anything of killing babies, but will fly to the moon to stop capital punishment.\n\n \n Lets not over-generalise. I am pro-choice, and I support capital punishment.\n \n \nBaby killers are sick or evil, take your pick.\n\n \n Says who? You? I'm afraid that your opinions on the matter do no count as fact. And I would posit that forcing people to do things, because in your opinion they are the right things to do smacks of the very worst kind of totalitarianism, and is only one step removed from the regimes of Stalin and Pol Pot.",

What about the people that decide to defend the defenseless without the help of \"God's word\". Please explain to me why believing in God makes everything better, why it's better than being a good person all on your own without threats of eternal damnation. Perhaps this post is slightly emotionally charged, but just because your a christian doesn't make you an all-knowing saint; back off of other beliefs for a minute and talk about abortion. How it's wrong because everything deserves a chance to live, killing off potential before it even has the chance to think is a horrible, horrible thing. Say something like that, please. Don't tell me that God says it's bad, so now everyone has to stop what they're doing and say, \"Yes, God says it's bad. Now that we have this information we can stop abortion once and for all.\" I know God say's murder (or killing, whatever you're version of the ten commandments is) is wrong, you don't have to try and make everyone feel a little bit stupider by saying something completely enlightening (please note sarcasm). Just stick to abortion, it'd be nice, in an abortion forum. (if you can read this, congratulations, you made it to the end of my first message; or maybe you skipped ahead, cheater)\n \n As for my opinion on abortion, or rather, the propaganda surrounding both sides is that it is very misleading. Do your homework, and while you're doing your homework be very paranoid as to the credibility of what you are reading. People aren't always trying to save babies or promote women's choice, they're trying to sell you life and choice. They don't need you to think, they just need your vote, your money, your support. Be a skeptic, be a cynic, and most of all, have fun. :)",

   "Abortion is flat wrong. That is it in a nut-shell.\n\n \n I would posit that right and wrong are a matter of perspective, and not absolute.\n \n I would support this with our very own disagreement. You believe you are right, and I believe you are wrong. There is no over-riding 'code' to prove either case. So that is where it ends. You think you are right, I think I am right, and both of us, at the same time, can be right.\n \n You would counter this with the Bible, obviously, citing certain passages as support for a Lord of Absolute Morality. I would like to take this opportunity to point out that the bible is simply a book, written by men, with very little objective historical support. Clearly, you believe that this is enough to base your decisions on.\n \n Given that this is all that is required, I have written a book, which contains loose links to historical facts. In this book I have written that my God spoke to me and said Abortion is okay.\n \n What do you use to support your position of absolute right and wrong?
