   "Alright, besides punishment and reduction of assets, why would anyone go for a interest only mortgage?\n \n \n Many people (at least in the UK) have opted for interest only mortgage repayments because huge loans are required to buy in a property market where prices have risen enormously. Paying both interest and some of the principal back each month has become unaffordable for people on the margins of home ownership in the current housing bubble. \n \n The obvious economic downsides have to be tolerated for the sake of getting on the housing ladder.",

   "Alright, besides punishment and reduction of assets, why would anyone go for a interest only mortgage?\n\n \n All personal mortgages are qualified on ability to service debt, make the payment. Personal mortgages are granted by ratios of gross income to payment and net income to payment. Interest only mortgages, with no principle repayment, have lower payments, allowing people to enter into home ownership who wouldn't qualify for a conventional mortgage or buy more house than they could qualify for with a conventional mortgage where a portion of the payment is directed to reducing principle. Potential financial suicide as the investment is based on continued upward market valuation rather than principle reduction to provide equity. \n \n For individuals properly using interest only loans, the criterion is spread. If one's normal investments are paying say 15% and a personal residence mortgage can be constructed for 6%, there's a leverage factor of 9% plus tax advantages depending on tax bracket. \n \n For business purposes, the issue is weighted average cost of capital. If the cost of capital is say 10% and what's called a revolving line of credit (interest only, renewed on an annual basis) can be secured for say 8%, the revolving line of credit is used for operating expenses rather than increasing the capital position.",

   "Huh?\n \n While the payments on a interst loan are lower per payment then a principal, the over all cost as astronomically higher. Unlike a normal loan, where you can go in the next day and drop $5000 towards the princiapl, or merely include a extra $100 in payments, virtually shaving off in many cases $100,000, that doesn't exist in interest only. IMO, it is likely selling yourself into slavery. \n \n What about interest only ARMs? That has to be insanity.",

IMO, it is likely selling yourself into slavery. \n \n What about interest only ARMs? That has to be insanity.\n\n \n Most interest only loans, mortgage or otherwise, allow principle payments to be made at the borrower's discretion. In reality, most interest only mortgages are initiated because the borrower doesn't have cash flow considered adequate to meet payments on a conventional mortgage, so there's little if any spare cash to make principle payments. A common measurement for the general public to determine affordability of anything is payment amount, not value or cost.\n \n ARMs are just another tool to allow qualification for mortgages by a larger market. Qualifying is based on the initial payment term, not increased segments. Residential real estate has appreciated on a steady basis and most borrowers 'know' they're going to sell the residence and make a pile of money before payments adjust and increase beyond their ability to service them. They also neglect the fact that in order to qualify for the free capital gain ride they have to remain in that primary residence for a period of two years. 2007 is a long time out for that level of speculation in what's now a mature cycle.",

   "Alright, besides punishment and reduction of assets, why would anyone go for a interest only mortgage?\nIt's a gambler's bet. There are places in California where the value of a home increased by $2000 PER DAY for several months on end. As I understand it, most arrangements like this are for a fixed period, perhaps four or five years, after which you owe a balloon payment which you customarily pay by negotiating a more conventional mortgage. If the value of your home has increased greatly, the mortgage is a much smaller fraction of the total value than when you started and you are in a better bargaining position. \n \n ARMS are also temporary solutions for problems which you hope are temporary, where you are betting on being in a much stronger financial position (bigger salary) before the other shoe drops.\n \n Personally, I wouldn't touch either one of them.",

Mine's a 5 year, so basically 4 years from now I'll be renegotiating, if I haven't already sold the place and moved on. The idea, though, is that I'll be selling it before long anyway. The other nice thing about it (not sure if this is standard for all mortgages or not, but I was under the impression that it was not), is that there's no penalty for early payment, so if I sell tomorrow for more than I bought the place for, I can pay off my mortgage and interest and walk away from it scot free.",

The average person, not yourself from your description, used such a loan because they couldn't qualify for a conventional loan and wanted a house to live in, not for speculation. Real wages, again we're using the average working person(s) example, have not increased in a couple of years and with inflation now flexing that muscle, real wages are actual decreasing in buying power. Let's say the RE market adjusts downward in one, two, or three years, market values drop, interest rates go up (as they are), leaving someone with a house they can't sell for enough to retire the interest only mortgage and no way to refinance the imminent terminating mortgage at higher rates. A crapshoot against formidable odds at best; the RE market will never stop appreciating and interest rates will remain at record lows.",
