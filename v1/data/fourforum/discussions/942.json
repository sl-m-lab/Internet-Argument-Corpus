   "With all the activity in the animal experiments thread, why not start one up on vegetarianism? \n Do you think it is wrong to kill animals and eat them? Or is it ok?\n \n Over a year ago, I began wrestling with this issue. Inside, I knew that it was wrong to eat meat but my diet was so concentrated on carnivorism and I knew it would be extremely hard to stop. So I decided to make a gradual change toward vegetarianism. In August of 2002 I told myself that I would go for one year without eating any read meat. I was able to do it with relative ease, which surprised me. So last August, after a year without eating red meat, I decided to become a vegetarian. Its been three weeks and so far I've been doing very good. I've discovered alot of good vegetarian dishes and alternatives to meat that taste very good. Vegetarian lasagna is my favorite dish. Veggie burgers are very tasty too, I cant believe how similarly they taste to the real thing.\n \n Anyway what are your thoughts?",

We have a vegetarian diner in the cafeteria, and the food is great.\n \n I agree about not wanting to be a vegan, I cant imagine living without dairy products. As long as I'm not actually eating meat, I'm ok with it.\n \n And yes, boca burgers are very good. Thats the only brand that I've tried though, I dont know how the other ones taste. Crim, if you've tried a boca burger and you think it tastes nothing like a hamburger, then you're letting your own personal bias against vegetarian alternatives get in the way. They have done several taste tests where they have blindfolded people (who are carnivores) and ask them if its a hamburger or veggie burger. Most of them thought it was a hamburger.\n \n Anyway, I think its pretty clear that eating meat is unethical. Here is an excerpt from the PETA website that gives a good image of why:\n \n Animals raised for food have virtually no legal protection, which means that in today's factory farms, anything goes. At slaughter, there is one federal law saying that cows and pigs must be stunned before their throats are slit, but the law carries no penalties and is not followed or enforced. If a \"farmer,\" truck driver, or slaughterehouse worker were to treat a dog or cat the way they treat cows, pigs, chickens, and fish, they could be locked up for animal abuse.\n \n On today's factory farms, animals often spend their entire lives confined to cages or stalls barely larger than their own bodies. Death for these animals doesn't always come quickly-or painlessly. House of Representatives Agriculture Committee member George E. Brown has written that to keep production lines moving, slaughterhouse employees \"often find themselves resorting to unbelievable brutality. ... Slaughter workers admit to routinely strangling, beating, scalding, skinning and dismembering fully conscious animals.\" Every year, nearly 9 billion animals are killed for food in the United States alone.\n \n Nine billion animals is an insane number, and it is every year in the United States alone.",

   "yes, truly, that's sad.\n \n would you like to know how they create lushes steaks of veal? well i'll tell you. farmers impregnate (rape.. sorry i had to throw that in) a cow for it to have calves. these calves are left with their mother until they are able to fend for themselves. as soon as this occurs, the cows are shoved into boxes, the size of their bodies, with only their head able to poke through a hole in the front. they are fattened up for months, never moving their entire lives (besides crawling toward their mother). at the ripe age of adolecence, the cow is then killed. how? well. they take a long blade and saw upwards from the jugular until the head is snapped off. this is a regular practice.\n \n you think the large companies knock out the animals? hit them on the head? inject them with tranquilizers? first off, they will not inject anything into an animal that will be shipped off and fed to familes, and second, they will not knock them out before doing so. why? because companies want to get through things the cheapest way.\n \n i will probably convert to vegetarian. i will not take part in senseless murder. i say senseless because we humans do not need meat. at one point, we did, when we were hunter-gatherers. but now, we are set in the future, where such things are not needed. i plan to start my vegetarian spree today, at lunch, in about 1 hour. thank-you fallingupwards.",

First of all cars are only bad for pollution just as power is. We can find alternatives but we are lazy about doing this because it is easiest not to try and many people make their livings off of oil. For forests it is pretty similar. Our tactics for cutting down forests are not that efficient and we could make the system work better. We could also replant these forests in order to maintain our current level of forests.\n \n The real difference between the two groups is that my examples take a societies efforts while your example takes and individual effort.

What is the defining trait of the species that sets them apart from those who are alright to kill and those who are wrong to kill?\n \n As Crim's question implied, does this apply to plants? How about plants that animals feed on?\n \n I think your response to this will be that insects are fine to kill but mammals, birds, fish, and amphibians are wrong to kill. At least this is the position I would take if I were a vegatarian. But I'm not sure how I would describe what separates this group from insects other than where they stand on the food chain. Size, numbers, and there tendancy to annoy humans are one way, but when you think about it we are killing them just because we don't care that we live. With other forms of life we are killing them for food and that serves a purpose. The insects we don't even kill for a purpose most of the time. We just do it because it is convenient for us.

Pardon me for not wanting to be associated with it. \n \n This whole \"you're killing more animals by eating vegetables\" is bull**** and you guys know it. The fact is that I along with millions and millions of other vegetarians have chosen not to eat animals, and you have. It all comes down to whether or not you think killing animals for food is wrong. If you do not think it is wrong, then fine. That is a valid excuse for eating meat. But saying that you eat meat because being a vegetarian kills more animals is complete bull**** and doesnt make any logical sense at all.\n \n I'm going to get hounded for using this analogy, but I'll go ahead and use it. When the debate over slavery began in the 18th century, alot of the people who defended slavery made up stupid excuses like \"its our property\" or \"its the rights of the states\". They avoided the core issue: is enslaving another human wrong or ok? \n With the exception of amd4ever, the rest of y'all are making lousy excuses for the eating of other animals. At least amd4ever is giving a good reason for eating meat... he doesnt think that its wrong. \n \n I cant make you change your mind on the issue of whether or not eating animals is wrong. But when you say that I am killing more animals by not eating meat, you are being absolutely ridiculous. I'm assuming that Chobo eats NO vegetables and only meat. Because if he ate vegetables and meat then he would, according to his sketchy \"facts\", be killing twice the amount of animals. \n \n Dont overcomplicate a simple issue",

You must also know you cannot change opposing views of this either just based on how strongly you hold your own moral view. I don't think you need to be asking for answers when it comes to whether it is morally right or wrong to kill animals because there are no answers.

   "So this is what i want: compelling reasons to not harm animals (falling has attempted this) that are interpersonal (this has been satisfied) and apply in the absense of other-directed interests (this has not been satisfied).\n\n \n \n I really don't see what compelling reasons you have not to harm humans other than it is a sign of our level of civilization and personal opinion. We don't harm humans because there are laws protecting them and people are brought up to respect human life. Still I can prove it isn't universally wrong to kill humans. In the modern world there is compelling reasons to hurt humans in times of war, hunger, or personal danger. You really cannot say that there is a compelling reason to not hurt humans in all cases unless you're unwilling to fight in war, fight for food, or fight to protect yourself or someone else. It is an individual opinion as to whether there is a compelling reason to hurt humans or not as well as a situational one. Different people may feel the need to hurt or kill humans in different situations. Those that think it is morally wrong are the ones who will hold out the longest but it is clear not everyone thinks it is morally wrong. Assuming you believe it is morally wrong, you still cannot convince anyone that there is a compelling reason not to kill someone somewhere in this world at some given time and situation when it is there opinion that they should because it is a matter of opinion.

We don't harm humans because there are laws protecting them and people are brought up to respect human life. Still I can prove it isn't universally wrong to kill humans. In the modern world there is compelling reasons to hurt humans in times of war, hunger, or personal danger. You really cannot say that there is a compelling reason to not hurt humans in all cases unless you're unwilling to fight in war, fight for food, or fight to protect yourself or someone else. It is an individual opinion as to whether there is a compelling reason to hurt humans or not as well as a situational one. Different people may feel the need to hurt or kill humans in different situations. Those that think it is morally wrong are the ones who will hold out the longest but it is clear not everyone thinks it is morally wrong.

I'm not surprised you don't want me to redirect this question back at you since you have no idea what you would say.\n \n Let's see, proof. Proof is only evidence that people put faith in. If you refuse to put faith in even the most obvious evidence then it can never be proof. Since I believe you are bound to your ideas and will refuse any evidence I provide as proof I really doubt I can provide proof to you. Whether something constitutes as proof is also an individuals opinion in case you want to debate that next. Also this plays a part in the rest of my debate.\n \n Morality. What is right and what is wrong. Why is it an individual opinion? Because people can be presented with all the evidence in the world and can come up with different conclusions on what they think is right and wrong. Some will discover the same things are moral and some will disagree on what is moral. No one can prove either side is right or wrong as both view themselves as right and since they believe in their own evidence they believe can believe that they have proof they are right. For instance, I have enough evidence to prove that Hitler did things that were evil. I can prove this only to myself unless you share my morals on the specific subjects I would bring up about Hitler to at least some degree. Hitler didn't share my morals so he wouldn't think I had proof but he would think that he had proof that he was correct which of course I could never accept as proof.\n \n I get the feeling that you already knew the answer to the question you asked so I can only wonder why it is that you asked it.

   "Hi everyone, this is my first time posting and I just joined yesterday... :) it seems like a great place here and this happened to be the first thread I read, just wanted to put my 2 cents in. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n I have been toying with the idea of vegetarianism since... about 2 years ago when I was assigned to write a research paper on animal rights. I didn't eat red meat in the first place before doing the paper but once I started researching and reading what goes on I really took a good look at it and thought of the many reasons to switch to it. As some of you have said you probably wouldn't become a vegan and just a vegetarian, I also thought about that and came to the conclusion that I could stop eating meat but not animal products and/or going to the extreme of not buying from a supermarket. I think it's fine to not eat any meat at all but (for me) I wouldn't be able to not eat dairy or not buy from a grocery store. I think that might be a tad extreme. I recently (this summer) tried going totally vegetarian and I have to say it feels great. I mean besides that it does a lot for the animals it also makes me feel better about myself. Some meat is pretty fatty and it makes me feel more healthy. The veggie burgers really DO taste like the real thing! lol it's actually not that bad and I have to say I prefer it over real meat. There are a lot of healthy alternatives to meat, so we can all still get the right nutrition. I say, if we don't have to kill them for food, then let's STOP.",

   "AMD,\n \n Your argument is a non-sequitur. To see why, imagine that, given a range of conflicting opinions, one side of the issue is simple *mistaken* about what morality is or is not. As your conclusion follows just as easily as mine, we have to agree that its disqualified in the formal sense. Now my argument.\n \n I'll have to cut it up because of character restrictions, but i'll go point by point.\n \n 1. Preference is ones desire for a certain outcome:\n \n This, I think, is pretty uncontroversial. To say one prefers an apple to an orange is to say one prefers the eating of an apple to an orange.\n \n 2. Utility is the measure of preference:\n \n Utility is to preference what temperature is to heat. It is ascribed to states of affairs considered as preference relations, and ranked in such a way that we can infer an agents preference vis-a-vis different outcomes.\n \n 3. Value can be equated with utility:\n \n In this conception, value, like utility, is a measure of preference. The value of a state of affairs is the extent to which one prefers it to others.\n \n 4. Value is subjective (dependent on affective relationships):\n Value is not inherent to objects, or more precisely, to state of affairs involving those objects; is it not part of the \"ontological furniture of the universe\", as Gauthier says. Rather, it is created and determined via preference. This is not to be confused with the idea that value is arbitrary or unknowable.\n \n 5. Value is relative (dependent on each particular individuals affective relationships):\n \n This is also fairly clear. People of different stripes accord different states of affairs different values. Just a cursory glace at history (or your friends and family) will show this.\n \n 6. While revealed preference is useful in economics, choice is not always rational:\n \n Consider Queen Gertrude, who chooses the poisoned the cup. It would no doubt be wrong to suppose she chose that outcome because she perfered it. Although mistaken, the choice was not irrational because she did not have the relevant information. Had she known about it, and supposing her aim was not suicide, then it *would* be irrational. We might then speak of rationality concerning itself with \"considered preference\", preference with the relevant information, and due consideration.\n \n 7. Practical rationality is concerned with the maximization of individual utility, the measure of (considered) preference. In the real world, this often means choosing actions not only because of their outcome, but because of the probability of the outcome\n \n On this conception, a rational individual will take those actions toward a \"lottery\", the prize of which is a desired outcome. If Billy knows smoking might cause health complications down the road, and values his later life more than his current smoking, it would be rational for him to quit. If, in the same situation he continues, he is acting irrationally. It should be stressed that the *content* of the preference (as of now) doesnt mean anything for us. We will defend Hume when he says, its \"not contrary to reason to prefer the destruction of the whole world to the scratching of my finger\"\n \n 8. When interacting with others, that is, under conditions of strategic choice, the definition of outcome under conditions of parametric choice has to be altered as to say that an outcome is the product of several actions, one for each person involved, in a set of determinate circumstances.\n \n This is simply to say, when dealing when you, outcomes I prefer are not solely to be determined what i do; it depends as much on what you do.\n \n 9. Strategic rationality itself rests on three conditions: A) each person choice must be a rational response to the choices she expects others to make, B) each person must expect every other person's choice to satisfy condition A, and C) each person must believe her choice and expectations to be reflected in the expectations of everyone else.\n \n Condition A relates the rationality of the agent to the interactions, B makes explicit that all agents in the interaction are rational, and C makes explicit the assumption that each person views the situation as if her knowledge of the grounds for choice were complete (that is, shared by all and known by all to be shared).",

   "...Continued....\n \n 10. A strategy is a lottery over the possible actions involving other actors. A \"pure\" strategy assigns a probability of 1 to one action, and a 0 to the rest. A \"mixed\" strategy assigns a non-zero probability to more than one action, the sum of which is, of course 1.\n \n Another simple matter of definition. It should be noted that this is not, as before, a case of actions performed under risk, with outcomes as a reward. Rather, this is *choice**as a lottery with actions as the prize. They should not be confused.\n \n 11. The expected outcome is the sum of the strategies chosen by each agent, when interacting.\n \n Another definition.\n \n 12.An expected outcome is in equilibrium if and only if it is the product of strategies that are mutually utility maximizing.\n \n Yet another. This one is highly important.\n \n 13. Given the conditions for strategic rationality, and equating a rational response with a utility maximizing response, each actor must expect his outcome to be in equilibrium (from 7, 9 and 12)\n \n To illustrate, lets suppose there are n number of people, and let person 1 choose strategy S1. By condition A, S1 maximizes his utility given the strategies (S2, S3......Sn) of the other actors, which he expects them to choose. According to B, S2 must maximize person 2's utility given the strategies of S1, S3....Sn, which person 1 expects person 2 to expect. And S3 must maximize person 3's utility given the other strategies which person 1 expects 3 to expect, and so on. By C, person 1's choice and expectations must be reflected in his beliefs about others expectations, so that S1=S1'=S1''...and S2=S2'....and S3=S3'...and so on. Hence each strategy must be utility-maximizing given the others and so the expected outcome must be in equilibrium. This is true of all situations, as Nash discovered. Note that this does leave room for incorrect expections, in which case the solution could not be an equilibrium, but thats the fault of the expectations, and not the choice.\n \n This can be illustrated again with a concrete, real world example. Suppose there are two people, Smith and Jones. Smith wants to go to Fisher's party, but even more, wants to avoid Jones who may be there. Jones wants to avoid the party, but would love to see Smith. If Smith expects Jones to go the party, Smith will stay home. If Jones expects Smith to go, so will he. They face, as it where, a problem of interaction. None of the possibly outcomes afforded by a pure strategy will end in equilibrium, so we have to introduce mixed strategies and assign utilities to their outcomes. Lets suppose that Smith is indifferent between her second preference (staying home if Jones goes) and a lottery with a 2/3 chance of her first preference (going to the party if Jones stays home) and a 1/3 chance of her fourth preference (both going to the party). Further, lets suppose she is indifferent between her third preference (both staying home) and a lottery with a 1/3 chance of her first preference and a 2/3 chance of her fourth. We can then assign utility functions of 1, 2/3, 1/3 and 0 to the four outcomes in order of Smith's preference. Now lets suppose Jones in indifferent between his second preference (both staying home) and a lottery with a 1/2 chance of his first preference (both going) and a 1/2 chance of his fourth (staying at home with Smith going). And lets suppose that he is indifferent between his third preference (going if Smith stays) and a lottery with a 1/6 chance of his first preference and a 5/6 chance of his fourth. To these, we assign utilities of 1, 1/2, 1/6 and 0 in order of his preference. We can then write the following matrix:\n \n Smith goes, Jones goes: 0,1\n Smith stays, Jones goes: 2/3, 1/6\n Smith goes, Jones stays: 1, 0\n Smith stays, Jones stays: 1/3, 1/2\n \n Suppose that Smith chooses a mixed strategy assigning a probability of 1/4 to going to the party, and a 3/4 to staying at home. Then, if Jones goes, his expected utility is [(1/4 x 1) + (3/4 x 1/6)] = 3/8. If Jones stays at home his utility will be [(1/4 x 0) + (3/4 x 1/2)] = 3/8. Each action yields the same utility. Suppose we say Jones assigns a1/2 probability to going, and a 1/2 to staying. Again, whatever Smith chooses, her utility will be 1/2\n \n 14. Although there is always at least one outcome that is in equilibrium, there can be more than one.\n \n Consider the following sort of matrix:\n \n Smith does, Jones does: 1,1\n Smith does, Jones doesnt: 0, 1\n Smith doesnt, Jones does: 1, 0\n Smith doesnt, Jones doesnt: 0, 0\n \n Each expected outcome is in equilibrium.\n \n 15. An equilibrium outcome is dominated if everyone disperfers it to another equilibrium outcome. The undominated outcome is the one perfered by everyone.\n \n In the example above, the bottom three are dominated, and the top is undominated.",

   "...Continued...\n \n 16. Despite the fact that an undominated outcome may be perfered in the situation described, there is no way to affect the utility one can get by ones choice.\n \n This sort of example is going to be central for our later account of morality. Because we have not yet dealt with the content of preference, we can say both people are formally selfish. They could maximize each others utilities at no cost, but, we can say, have no reason to do so.\n \n Things can actually, get quite worse, given in the form of the Prisoner's Dilemma. I have a thing a thing you like, you have a thing I like. I like your thing more than my thing (and vise versa), but both things better than either one alone. We could:\n \n I trade, you steal: 4th, 1st\n I trade, you trade: 2nd, 2nd\n I steal, you trade: 1st, 4th\n We both do nothing: 3rd, 3rd\n \n According to the logic involved in maximization so far, I should reason as follows: \"If you*attempt trade, i'd be better off stealing. Having both is better than just having one. And suppose you try to steal. Obviously, it isent wise to try to trade, as having my thing alone is better than having nothing at all. In any case, I should not try to trade\". Each aims for utility maximization, but ultimately leave each worse off.\n \n 17. A joint strategy is the product of the actors set of strategies, one for each involved in interaction. These, in turn, can be mixed or pure.\n \n 18. To solve the*sort of problem above, we introduce the principle of minimax relative concession, that is, given a range of outcomes, each of which require concessions by some or all persons if it is to be selected, then an outcome be selected only if the maximum relative concession it requires is as small as possible, or a minimum.\n \n This is just to say that the maximum concession be no greater than the maximum relative concession required. In the Prisoner's Dilemma above, it would require each to concede a single point of utility (their best possible outcome)\n \n 19. By minimizing maximum concession, one maximizes minimum benefit (maximin relative benefit).\n \n Again, in the PD situation above, you will see this is the case. Relative benefit and concession sum into unity: [(u-u*)/(u*-u*)] + [(u*-u)/(u*-u*)] = 1.\n \n 20. Minimum benefit is an optimal outcome, an outcome that cannot make anyone better off without making someone worse off. In Prisoner's Dilemma type situations, this is a superior outcome than straight utility-maximization.\n \n Once again, we can see this is true. The second outcome from top is such that, should either one be better off, the other is worse off.\n \n 21. It is rational to adopt a metachoice, a choice about how to make choices, we will call constrained maximization.\n \n A constrained maximizer is someone conditionally disposed to base acions on the joint strategies of others according to the principle of minimax relative concession. This is utility-maximizing.\n \n 22. This conditional disposition can be rephrased as the Lockeian proviso.\n \n Do not worsen the condition of others, assuming that they afford you the same. This applies only to humans, for reasons that should be clear.\n \n -GFA",

Without those minerals our immune systems dwindle and we get sick. Some people die.\n\n explain why we need meat.\n wait, i'll explain why not:\n \"Protein. Many believe that protein is a vegetarian's nutrient at greatest risk; however this isn't the case. This concern has come about because most plant proteins have a lower quality than animal proteins and alone they don't provide all the essential amino acids. However, soy protein is considered nutritionally equal to animal proteins. And although other plant proteins typically lack one to two essential amino acids, consuming a balanced variety of protein sources throughout the day readily resolves the issue. In addition, some vegetarians opt to add eggs and dairy proteins.\"\n \n \"Meats contain highly available iron due to the presence of heme iron. Vegetarians can better absorb the iron in plants by consuming them with acidic or vitamin-C-rich foods, such as tomatoes or orange juice. Key vegetarian iron sources are whole grains, iron-fortified grains, legumes, soybeans, tofu, meat alternatives, nuts, egg yolks and dried fruit.\"\n \n \"Omega-3 fatty acids. One oft-overlooked nutrient in vegetarian diets is omega-3 fatty acids. These contribute to retinal and brain development and may play a role in reducing cardiovascular disease. The predominant sources are fish and egg yolks. Vegetarians who exclude these foods should consume a serving of flaxseed oil, canola oil or walnuts daily.\"\n \n taken from: http://www.foodproductdesign.com/archive/2002/0202NN.html (more here)\n \nI suppose some of you would rather ingest synthetic proteins and suppliments as opposed to natural minerals.

   "Why not eat meat?\n\n Because it's better not to. \n It is ecologically and economically safer to eat lower on the food chain. \n 1. George Washington Carver found 325 uses for peanuts, 100 for potatoes and 100 for corn. You can't do that with animal derived foods.\n 2. Plants have seeds and therefore are easier to sustain than are animal foods. Also, did you know it takes 390 gallons of water to process one pound of beef? 12 million people die each year from lack of water and 1.1 billion people lack access to clean water. We can't afford this kind of waste.\n 3. The Animal Products industry is corrupt, especially in third world countries the rich buy land and water to fish, taking the livelihood of poor peasants who cannot defend themselves. Once the supplies are depleted and the ecosystem has been shot to hell, the big companies leave and the poor have no jobs. Peoples lives can't depend on a system that's so shaky and uncertain. \n \n We DO need meat to survive. Well, the contents of the meat at any rate.

Have you seen that man's abs?\n Vanessa Williams and Natalie Portman are vegetarians. \n So was Princess Di, who once served a 17 course meal that was completely meatless. \n Thomas Edison was vegetarian, so was Albert EInstein, Leonardo DaVinci, Tolstoy and Charles Darwin.\n Mr. Rogers and Henry David Thoreau both supported the vegetarian lifestyle. \n According to the American Dietetic Association vegetarians usually exceed the requirements for protein and iron can be found in any leafy green vegetable. \n And according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN, eating more fruit and vegetables is a top priority in the fight agaisnt hunger.\n Besides having to listen to the indignant whining of meat eaters everytime I sit down to eat, I find no downside to vegetarianism.",

I agree with you on that\n But what about quality of life?\n What's the use of living to be 100 if you have arthritis and mirgraines and bad eyesight? Old people are known for such suffering.\n \n This is from the American Heart Association\n \n \n Vegetarian Diets\n \n \n What is a vegetarian diet?\n \n Some people follow a \"vegetarian\" diet, but there's no single vegetarian eating pattern. The vegan or total vegetarian diet includes only foods from plants: fruits, vegetables, legumes (dried beans and peas), grains, seeds and nuts. The lactovegetarian diet includes plant foods plus cheese and other dairy products. The ovo-lactovegetarian (or lacto-ovovegetarian) diet also includes eggs. Semi-vegetarians don't eat red meat but include chicken and fish with plant foods, dairy products and eggs.\n \n Are vegetarian diets healthful?\n \n Most vegetarian diets are low in animal products. They're also usually lower than nonvegetarian diets in total fat, saturated fat and cholesterol. Many studies have shown that vegetarians seem to have a lower risk of obesity, coronary heart disease (which causes heart attack), high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus and some forms of cancer. \n \n Vegetarian diets can be healthful and nutritionally sound if they're carefully planned to include essential nutrients. However, a vegetarian diet can be unhealthy if it contains too many calories and not enough important nutrients.\n \n What are the nutrients to consider in a vegetarian diet?\n \n Protein: You don't need to eat foods from animals to have enough protein in your diet. Plant proteins alone can provide enough of the essential and non-essential amino acids, as long as sources of dietary protein are varied and caloric intake is high enough to meet energy needs.  \n Whole grains, legumes, vegetables, seeds and nuts all contain both essential and non-essential amino acids. You don't need to consciously combine these foods (\"complementary proteins\") within a given meal. \n Soy protein has been shown to be equal to proteins of animal origin. It can be your sole protein source if you choose.  \n Iron: Vegetarians may have a greater risk of iron deficiency than nonvegetarians. The richest sources of iron are red meat, liver and egg yolk -- all high in cholesterol. However, dried beans, spinach, enriched products, brewer's yeast and dried fruits are all good plant sources of iron.  Vitamin B-12: This comes naturally only from animal sources. Vegans need a reliable source of vitamin B-12. It can be found in some fortified (not enriched) breakfast cereals, fortified soy beverages, some brands of nutritional (brewer's) yeast and other foods (check the labels), as well as vitamin supplements. \n Vitamin D: Vegans should have a reliable source of vitamin D. Vegans who don't get much sunlight may need a supplement. \n Calcium: Studies show that vegetarians absorb and retain more calcium from foods than nonvegetarians do. Vegetable greens such as spinach, kale and broccoli, and some legumes and soybean products, are good sources of calcium from plants. \n Zinc: Zinc is needed for growth and development. Good plant sources include grains, nuts and legumes. Shellfish are an excellent source of zinc. Take care to select supplements containing no more than 15-18 mg zinc. Supplements containing 50 mg or more may lower HDL (\"good\") cholesterol in some people. \n What meal plans are recommended?\n \n Any type of vegetarian diet should include a wide variety of foods and enough calories to meet your energy needs.\n \n Keep your intake of sweets and fatty foods to a minimum. These foods are low in nutrients and high in calories. \n Choose whole or unrefined grain products when possible, or use fortified or enriched cereal products. \n Use a variety of fruits and vegetables, including foods that are good sources of vitamins A and C. \n If you use milk or dairy products, choose fat-free/nonfat and low-fat varieties. \n Eggs are high in cholesterol (213 mg per yolk), so monitor your use of them. Limit your cholesterol intake to no more than 300 mg per day. \n Related AHA publications:\n An Eating Plan for Healthy Americans...

We need animal proteins. :)\n \n\n \n Well personally, I would take the US Department of Agriculture and the American Dietetic Associations word over Michael Moore's. Both have endorsed vegetarian diets. Studies have also shown that vegetarians have stronger immune systems than meat-eaters and that meat-eaters are almost twice as likely to die of heart disease, 60 percent more likely to die of cancer, and 30 percent more likely to die of other diseases.\n \n We need animal proteins?? Hahahaha. In America, our problem is that we get too much protein, not too little. Most Americans get about seven times as much protein as they need.

Well, to be honest, I can't really think of much in favor of eating meat.\n \n So you guys beleive that killing animals is equal to murder... Why? Is it because you beleive life is precious?

Do you beleive animals should have exact equality to us?\n\n \n ok there is a good chance that me and Gilligan might disagree on this, but I'll give you my answer.\n \n Is meat murder? Well yes personally I believe that killing any sentient being is murder, especially if it is done brutally. However, if one believes that morality is relative, then the killing of animals really isnt murder simply because its accepted by our society. But if killing animals is not socially acceptable, then that would mean meat is murder. I mean its kind of a complex thing and I'm interested to see Gilligan's response. Alot of it has to depend on your definition of murder. Some would define murder as the unlawful killing of something. In this case, neither meat would be murder (since its legal) nor abortion would be murder. (But then again, that would mean that the Nazis who killed Jews were not murderers, since it was legal). Like I said, its a very complex issue, but in the end I'm gonna have to say that I think the outright killing of ANY sentient being is murder.\n \n Is it because you believe suffering, even of animals, is bad? Yes I believe that all suffering, particularly unnecessary suffering, is wrong.\n \n Do you believe animals should have exact equality to us? Heh, this is where me and Gilligan may disagree. I'm not going to lie to you, if I had a choice of whether to save a human or save a dog, then I would choose the human (unless the guy was a real ******* :) ). This means that I think humans and all other animals (because humans are animals) are not equal. However this does not mean that I'm going to support the killing of animals simply because I value a human's life just a little more. If I had a choice of whether to save my sister or some random guy on the street that I dont know, obviously I would choose my sister. That means that I value the life of my sister more than someone else. But that doesnt mean I'm going to exploit, torture, and kill anyone who I do not value at the same level as my family and friends. Thats how I view it. Do I believe animals should be liberated? Absolutely. Should we integrate them into our society? Hahaha of course not! They arent as intelligent as mankind and cannot communicate with us. We should leave them alone! \n \n Anyway I hope I answered your questions :)",

   "Yes, it would be great if all humans stopped eating meat, providing they have an alternative, wouldn't it? No.\n \n I'll use Australia as an example, as that is where I live, and it also be the place where my thoughts may best apply. \n \n Australia is a country where much of the interior is deprived of decent soil quality, meaning the land would not be fertile enough to support crops of various vegetables and grains.\n \n Australia is also a country where up to 95% of the population happens to live on the coastline of the continent, where large cities and towns litter the land. The coastline and lands in the direct vesinity are also our most fertile. \n \n The point that I am trying to make is that, with consumers not eating meat, there will be a need a an enormous expansion in the supply of vegetables and grains, of which current crops would be unable to supply. And how does supply in this industry increase? Through the clearing of land to enable crop plantation. With the clearing of bush, scrub, and foresty comes the systematic wipeout of entire ecological systems, as has been seen in the tropical north of Australia. Many species of frog, insect, bird and other wildlife has been forced to the brink of extinction as farmers make way for their crops. Don't you think that everybody becoming vegetarian will only further compound that problem?\n \n With intensive farming and cultivation of the land comes the inevitable deterioration in soil and water properties through the use of chemical products. This is also an undesirable position for both humans and animals alike.\n \n With the significant reduction in habitat that would follow deforestation and clearing of the land, animals would experience immense over population and, coupled with the fact that humans would no longer need the animals for food, a situation would be faced where there is a huge undersupply of food for animals to eat as large quantities of animals become entangled in a competition for remaining food.\n \n Again, this situation was faced in Australia where 30,000 kangaroos decended on farming land simply because there was no food where they previuosly presided. This came about after there was a temproary halt to Kangaroo hunting. Authorities were left with the choice to either let the kangaroos starve to death, or cull them, they were culled. \n \n Where do you think animals live naturally? What do you think will happen to the habitats of animals once it is realized that more farmalnd is needed to supply populations with vegetables and grain?

Let's face it, any kind of domesticated animal would rather be somewhere where it can receive meals everyday as well as shelter and out in the wild, they would probably have a lesser quality of life with the constant danger of predators and starvation. So, stop speaking for the animals, you really don't know what they want. I sure don't claim to know exactly what they want.

The belief that humans are fundamentally flawed is a belief. It is a premise that many people operate under, but is not necessarily the only premise we could have. Nor is it necessarily the 'right' premise.\n \n Have you ever read any Daniel Quinn? For an introduction into a different perspective than the one you currently use, it may be a worthwhile exercise to read one of his books. Ishmael, for example.

   "harmful to the environment...destroying other elements of nature \n\n \n Sinjin and I went around on this before, but I want to pipe up here. Nature is never destroyed or harmed...nature is changed. In modern times humans have an awesome ability to drastically change the 'natural world'. Our perception of that change is often one of harm or destruction. That is, when a forest is cut down we assume the forest has been destroyed. This is certainly not true. It has been altered dramatically but nature still remains, there are microorganisms, pioneer plants, insects and so on. This is true whether in Northern Minnesota or the Amazon Rain Forest. \n \n Using the words destroyed or harmful anthropomorphizes nature by creating the impression that 'nature' is a singular entity which possesses a desire for a certain appearance or state. Of course this not true.\n \n When people speak of destroying nature, they view these changes through their lens, from their perspective and not that of nature. By doing this 'enviromentalists' are no different than a timber baron who sees the forest only for the money he can make. \n \n We can reduce this discussion to differing opinions on what people think nature should look like. What do they want out of it, at the basest level is it tall, tall trees or long, clear straight boards? It is never about what nature wants or needs, because nature doesn't want or need anything.\n \n Whistler",

Apparently not yet and certainly not in infinite numbers.\n\n How does 'man' define a 'high quality of life' though? If a 'high quality of life' is dependent upon material goods or products, then I believe it is safe to say that man cannot exist in that way and yet have little negative impact on the rest of the natural world.\n \n However, I would suggest that the majority of human beings do not have a 'high quality of life' today, even if it is defined as dependent upon material goods. A few human beings have a lot of material goods. Many human beings have some material goods. And the majority of the human beings have far less material goods. Yet across all levels of material possession, there is depression, anxiety, stress, anger, fear, suicide, etc... If we continue to define 'high quality of life' by possession of material goods, and we strive to allow everyone in the world the opportunities to possess the same amount of material goods as 'first world' countries possess, then resources will continue to be depleted at an accellerating rate, even if the population does not continue to increase.\n \n I am using this only as an example... I am not romaticizing anything, nor am I saying this is the way it should be... I would be willing to bet that an aboriginal person believes they have a 'high quality of life.' I would be willing to bet that if an Australian Aboriginal, for example, were taken out of the context of his culture and were taught everything about our culture -- including all the 'good' and the 'bad' -- and we told this person that they should strive to be like us, they would laugh.\n \n My point is that everything that happens in life is a matter of perspective.",

   "wow, 15 pages, i just spent about 2 or 3 hours reading the entire thread and honestly, its funny to me, i see a bunch of city slickers (sorry to those of you who arent) talking about animal cruelty like they know exactly how a cow thinks and feels, when many have never seen one\n \n heres the thing, i grew up on a farm, while we dont have cattle my grandpa does and i help him with them often, the best analogy i can give you is this\n \n PETA and others love to point out that YOU would be very mad if some of the things we did to animals happened to you, so lets take the worst thing, little bull calves are deprived of their testicles, we call them steers, it keeps their meat tender and prevents them grom killing eachother, is this cruel, no bovines dont experience sex in the way humans do, its a physical response, no emotions, the cow goes into heat and the bull services her, wham bam thank you maam, the bull is then moved to a pen to await the next \"season\" does he greive for the lose of his \"harem\" of course not, so depriving a young steer of sex later in life means nothing to him\n \n now on to other cruelty, yes we beat the cows, with a 6 ft stick thats about half an inch thick, they also have hides so tough they barely feel it. as to being skinned alive, blah, i have skinned a dead snake that was still moving (nerve impulses) and it takes twice as long, the businesses are in it for profit, which mean the most work per time, dead animals skin faster. they are also stunned before death, by a sledgehammer to the head or a capture bolt pistol\n \n as to you vegetarians who think animals feel, i advise you to go meet a few cows, watch them, yes they act scared, the instinctive kind of stupid scared that every animal has (example would be nearly strangling themselves trying to get out of the headgate) they dont understand whats going on, working them for 15 mins will show you that\n \n the difference between dogs and cows is like this, a dog cares what you think, well, your dog, when i am mad my dog cowers and begs for forgiveness, a cow would run like an idiot. as a sidenote it is not considered cruel or inhumane to kill a dog or cat, at least not around here, and chinese folks eat dog and cat, other cultures too\n \n now to what would happen if we \"liberate\" our livestock, they would die, horrible deaths of blackleg and other diseases, starvation, freezing, deaths we prevent by vaccination, quarrantine, feeding, windbreaks, a farmer cares for his cows, they are his livelyhood and they are usually treated as humanely as cows should expect to be, when cows become worthless dont expect them to be pets, they leave excrement everywhere, they are inatly stupid, they are huge and cost alot to feed\n \n also upwards, i believe what (damn, forgot his name) meant when he said more would die is like this, we do all farmwork with machinery now (even haycutting) after a field is mowed then vultures fill the air, they arent there for the corners we miss, they are there because we just ripped up the habitat of hundred of mice, rats, raccoons, possums, snakes, and birds (quail nest on the ground) and pulled many of them into the blades of our mowers/harvesters/combines, so with all this harvesting many more animals die, seing as how one cow will feed a family for over 6 months (of eating more than just the cow of course, all sorts of veggies) dont believe me, my grandpa raises 2 slaughter calves a year for us and my uncle, so 2 families of 4 can live along time off one cow, we just need the freezer space, its very good lean beef too, \n \n well, reading that huge thread took way to much time, its late and i have to sleep sometime\n Mathurin",

Humans are animals (don't even TRY to debate the other), driven by basic animal instincts that all animals share, such as need for food.\n \n However, i believe it is wrong to kill animals cruelly, and to prevent the animals from having any chance of survival.\n \n Why? Because animals suffer the same pain and etc. that we feel, and wish to survive just as we do. To deprive an animal of any chance of survival is wrong.\n \n And for those who claim that animals cannot feel, i ask you how do you define \"feeling\"?
