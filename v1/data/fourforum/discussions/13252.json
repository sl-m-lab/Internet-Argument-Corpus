   "Michael Duvall is a conservative Republican state representative from Orange County, California. While waiting for the start of a legislative hearing in July, the 54-year-old married father of two and family values champion began describing, for the benefit of a colleague seated next to him, his ongoing affairs with two different women. In very graphic detail.\n \n For instance:\n \n \n She wears little eye-patch underwear. So, the other day she came here with her underwear, Thursday. And&#8232; so, we had made love Wednesday--a lot! And so she'll, she's all, 'I am going &#8232;up and down the stairs, and ***********************!\n\n (edit: that was too graphic to post)\n \n Duvall's sophomoric braggadocio, of course, was picked up by the microphone in front of him, and wound up on a tape for the legislature's in-house TV station. From there it was sent to a local news station, KCAL, which ran this full report last night:\n \n YouTube - CAUGHT ON TAPE!!.....CA Assemblyman Michael Duvall; HOT MIC convo about sex 'a lot' and 'spanking'\n \n According to both KCAL and the OC Weekly, an alternative weekly in Orange County, the woman who wears the \"eye-patch underwear\" is Heidi DeJong Barsuglia, a lobbyist for an energy company, Sempra Energy. Duvall is vice chair of the Committee on Utilities & Commerce.\n \n In the tape, Duvall also says of Barsuglia:\n \n\n So, I am getting into spanking her. Yeah, I like it. I like spanking her. She goes, 'I know you like spanking me.' I said, 'Yeah! Because you're such a bad girl!'\n\n \n The OC Weekly explains that it identified Barsuglia as the woman Duvall was talking about because Duvall also said:\n \n \n And so her birthday was Monday. I was 54 on June 14, so for a month, she was 19 years younger than &#8232;me. I said, 'Now, you're getting old. I am going to have to trade you in.' And she goes, '[I'm] 36.' She is 18 years younger than me. And so I keep&#8232; teasing her, and she goes, 'I know you French men. You divide your age by &#8232;two and add seven, and if you're older than that, you dump us.\n\n\n GOP Lawmaker's Graphic Sex-Bragging Caught On Tape | TPMMuckraker\n \n As if this couldn't get any more bizarre, the two women he is cheating on his wife with are both lobbyists...\n O.C. lawmaker allegedly caught discussing his trysts with lobbyists [Updated] | L.A. Now | Los Angeles Times\n \n Republicans have a serious problem electing people who aren't white, christian, or straight...\n (don't believe me? look at their track record and who they elect)\n ... but when it comes to politicians who tout family values as they screw a woman (or man) who ain't their wife, THOSE guys they elect... emoticon_xgood\n \n You would think that if they had any real concern over \"family values\", there would be a better vetting process... :p",

   "this kind of statement show many things..\n \n 1) you lack a belief to take god seriously.\n 2) you have deluded beliefs that somehow you do not fear hell.\n 3) you seem to accept going to hell.\n 4) you fail to recognize that it is this kind of attitude that will lead you to hell.\n \n its not too late... you dont have to go to some church..\n \n Just recognise that there is more likely than not, a god of some kind.\n \n And you should not reject that god.\n \n And that Jesus, served a grand purpose as the means to make us worthy and wash away that sin we are born with.\n \n You should simply appreciate it, and take it... its free...\n \n it doesnt cost you anything... it saves you, and there is little burden on you to do anything in return.\n \n This one thing.. of changing your beliefs.. will change your attitude.. and will change your entire life, because with a new attitude you will have new behavior.. and where you may feel weak, you can find strength, where you may of turned left, you can turn right..\n \n God.. is empowering, and all you need to do is connect your self to god.\n \n Accept that regardless of all your faults, you are gods child, and god loves you, and wants whats best for you.. and wants to see you in heaven.\n \n Your not a bad apple... unless you choose to be.\n \n Repent, and ask forgiveness and be sincere,and god will embrace you, as he is the source of all love.\n \n -Mosheh Thezion\n\n \n That post shows many things:\n \n 1) You don't read my posts. If you did, you wold know I believe in reincarnation, not heaven or hell.\n 2) You don't think my beliefs mean anything. I don't say that your religion sucks and should join me cause I like my own beliefs! You apparently don't think enough of me or anyone but yourself since you think only your morals and beliefs are the right ones.\n 3) You think you can save me when I'm not in trouble\n 4) You take things waaaay to seriously\n 5) You'll be a sucktastic senator since you don't listen to what people are saying.",
