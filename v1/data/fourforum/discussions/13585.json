   "Gay New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Ray Buckley was called a \"XXXXXX\" by the host of a well-known New Hampshire right-wing radio show yesterday. NH Political Report via Blue Hampshire:\n \n After his radio show \"Meet the New Press\" ended today, GraniteGrok.com co-founder Doug Lambert looked into a live web-streaming camera, mockingly wished state Democratic Party Chairman Ray Buckley a Happy Birthday and then called Buckley a \"XXXXXX\" before basically wishing him dead.\n \n ...After co-host Skip Murphy said that he should probably shut off the feed, Lambert looked into the camera and said, \"Speaking of gays, Happy Birthday Ray Buckley. Are you going to Holland or taking another trip with your buddies?\"\n \n He then dances in a way meant to mock a gay male and says: \"Yeah you XXXXXX. [Pause.] That's right I said it and I meant it. You are reprobate. How the people, the Democrats, I think of some of the gray haired ladies and older people from the old party would stand behind you is beyond me. You are a disgrace to yourself to humanity to mankind and to your party.\n \n \"Other than that Happy Birthday Ray and many more -- not,\" Lambert continued before the feed was quickly shut off.\n \n Buckley Lambert's remarks were condemned by Rep. Jim Splaine: \"Ray Buckley has put up with a lot since he let others know he is gay. All of us who are openly gay are at times on the receiving end of such disgusting comments. Some of us receive hate mail or calls for what we do on our fight for equality. But in this case, Ray and the many others who have worked hard this year and in years past to achieve marriage equality in New Hampshire have a louder voice than this GraniteGrok co-host character. The majority of people in New Hampshire are on the side of equality and love, not hate and discrimination.\"\n \n Lambert apologized soon after the slur, but not before NH-01 Congressman Jeb Bradley (R) and current GOPer NH-Sen explorer Ovide Lamontagne, who were on his show today, distanced themselves. Said Lambert: \"To be blunt, what I said is something that never should have been said in any kind of a public setting, or, quite frankly, in a private one either. Being human, and an honest person that is used to freely speaking my mind, my passion got the best of me.\"",

   "Here is my response on Lambert's blog : Mr Lambert. Even though I am not one to cry foul especially upon those of talk radio whom are free to speak their minds and opinion no matter how absurd or obtuse, I do however feel it necessary to enlighten you on your comment toward Mr. Buckley. \"Yeah you XXXXXX. [Pause.] That's right I said it and I meant it. You are reprobate. How the people, the Democrats, I think of some of the gray haired ladies and older people from the old party would stand behind you is beyond me. You are a disgrace to yourself to humanity to mankind and to your party.\" This is what you said is it not? Look carefully over your remark. I would love to know how your \"passion\" got the best of you and not rather blatant bitter prejudice. I myself am an openly gay man, a veteran, and a man of faith as well. Your comment not only was sinister in nature, but also gave the public a slight glimpse into the depths of malice and contempt one person has toward their fellow man. This is not about politics, or issues, or opinion. It is about slander against an entire group of people. Just because you may think all gay people are those that wear tight jeans, eyeliner, and have a lisp, does not give you the clairvoyance to be biased especially when those prejudices and stigmas are fueled so easily by such comments. To be frank Mr. Lambert, gay people are not weak. We are not sex crazed lunatics, or borderline pedophiles which I do not doubt some of your colleagues would hint at. We are people. We are Americans. And we are just as dynamic and diverse as our fellow strait neighbors. we have jobs, pay our taxes, and god willing, have a loving partner whom we cherish, and a family we love and hold dear. If anyone is reprobate, if anyone is a disgrace to THEIR party it is you sir! You have not only fueled the prejudice and the stigma to your listeners, but have once again tainted any sense of stability or rationale in the Republican Party! With all due respect, which there is little of, if you were to say that sickening, revolting comment to my face, and danced around like a fairy mocking those whom are different, those who love and feel any more or less than you, I would have punched you smack in the face! Your show goes into nothing of the plight of gay people. The skyrocketing suicide rate of young gay teens rejected by their family, their friends, their church. You turn a blind eye to the growing number of homeless teens there now are wandering our streets getting mixed up in drugs, or prostitution to just afford a meager meal. You refuse to acknowledge the death of Seaman August Provost, an openly gay African American sailor who was shot to death in a guard shack in camp pendalton. Instead of being a voice for equality and humanity. One for all people and being a leader and a voice for all peoples, you instead resort to blind ignorance, and prejudice stemmed from your own ignorance, and lack of understanding or compassion toward others. Simply put, you should not have to give an apology, because such comments and childish remarks tipped in venom should never have been spewed from your lips period. And now because of prodding by your higher ups you give a watered down comment out of force rather than sincerity, not even condemning such a remark you expect the slate to be wiped clean? Guess again. Before you open your mouth and your warped mind attempts to connect the dots to make another cynical and cutting remark. Remember that someone may very well give you a call on your birthday and call you a \"XXXXXX\". Good Day Mr. Lambert...\n \n \n \n \n \n I also filed a complaint with the FCC for his comment. I won't stand by and let this garbage be spewed upon American's airwaves...",
