   "Was reading AA and Peeling's 1 on 1 debate, and read Archangels latest post. Since there isn't a \"popcorn gallery\" sort of thing going on for that forum, I'll comment here.\n \n Here was the quote that caught my eye: \nThis link about Geologic Evolution: http://www.handprint.com/PS/GEO/geoevo.html goes back 510 million years to the present and explains the processes the Earth took to get to where the Earth is today, geologically speaking. Notice how it describes the level life on Earth had attained around 270 million years ago, yet I just watched a documentary on Nat. Geo that very clearly showed that 250 million years ago, the Earth was basically engulfed in volcanic flames. Another example of contradictory evidence within the scientific community regarding the different stages of evolution the Earth experienced in order to get where we're at today.\n \n\n \n Now, there seem to be several sources of confusion for Archangel here. The first is that the time scale on the site he linked to is off The Permian began 300 million years ago (not 270 - unless they are trying to name when a particular event occured or something). Triasic began 250 Ma (not 230) - actually more like 251 Ma So I see where that could confuse you.\n \n Second, I don't think you are grasping the length of time involved here - I have to admit it is hard to do (I am a Geologist and it took me three years of college before I finally grasped it and even now it is tricky). So even taking the dates you named off (270 and 250), that is TWENTY MILLION!\n \n Thirdly, Nat Geo got it about right - around 250-251 Ma, was the end of the Permian and beginning of the Triassic - marked by the P-T extinction event, althought there are several vying hypotheses about the CAUSE of that extinction (I think what they are referring to are the flood basalts of the Siberian Traps which are indeed of Permian age). \n \n I can see why that might also be confusing, but you must remember the P-T event was the most deadly event in history - over 80% were wiped out.\n \n So no, it is not a \"contradiction\", it is WHAT HAPPENED! Yes there was a huge thriving population 300-270 Ma, and yes around 250 Ma a large portion of the world was covered in \"volcanic flames\" (and may have played a role in the P-T event although the extent of that role is still debated) - the Siberian Traps: \nVast volumes of basaltic lava paved over a large expanse of primeval Siberia in a flood basalt event. Today the area covered is about 2 million km\u00b2 and estimates of the original coverage are as high as 7 million km\u00b2. The original volume of lava is estimated to range from 1 to 4 million km\u00b3.\n \n The area covered lies between 50 and 75 degrees north latitude and 60 to 120 degrees east longitude. The volcanism continued for a million years and spanned the Permian-Triassic boundary.\n \n\n \n Hopefully you read this, Archangel, and this clears up some of the confusion you have here. Feel free to ask more questions on the subject as Geology is my passion.",
