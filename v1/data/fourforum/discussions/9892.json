   "http://www.salem-news.com/articles/may152007/falwell_051507.php \n73-year old Televangelist Rev. Jerry Falwell has died. He was found unconscious Tuesday, rushed to the hospital and was given CPR for about half an hour according to the AP. \n \n The News & Advance of Lynchburg reports that the well known and controversial Falwell missed a meeting about noon. He was found in his office, unconscious and unresponsive. He was rushed to Lynchburg General Hospital around 12:00 PM ET. \n \n Falwell has had heart problems in the past.\n \n Falwell was one of the first people to create the multi-million dollar industry of \"mega churches\". He founded the Moral Majority and became the most well-known face of the \"religious right\" in the 1980s. He said he found Jesus in 1952, and politics in 1979. He is known as \"the father of the political evangelical movement.\" \n \n He was outspoken, mostly against women's reproductive rights and against homosexuality. His statement after 9/11 about the event being punishment for abortions and homosexuality brought on perhaps his most public apology. \n \n He later founded the conservative Liberty University in Virginia, where he was today. He served as its president.\n",

Right now he's a cowering man hiding in a cave unable to do much of anything. You miss my point though. If Bin laden who's much worse then Falwell can be forgiven then Falwell himself can be despite his actions and statements. It was just a point about just how forgiving God must be.

Jesus even calls them names, vipers, hypocrits, wolves...\n \n \n You are a pseudo-Christian (as are many Christians) because you do not follow every little aspect of Christianity, prefering to favor one meaning/ interpretation over others and even over the whole. \n \n In the end, I find it ironic you're attempting to defend this man. After all, you're the type he'd state is causing the world to decay and suffer. He'd also ask you to repent of your heretical ways. You won't be in his heaven.\n \n \n I think you bicker because you missed my point. Trying to drown it out with 'relativism'\n \nThat's because any other damage that he caused is not quantifiable. It's opinion. Sure, maybe something he said did stir someone up to go kill someone who was gay. Who knows? Or maybe something he said did lead some kid to kill himself. We'll never know for sure. Which is the point. Now if you can prove that happened (any maybe you can, but just stating it happens isn't the same as proving it), then you have something.\n\n \n Those who know the bible and what it says knows the truth. The maybe's and opinions and desire for proofs shows a lack of faith and belief in the bible, what it says and teaches OR at the least, as I said, a lack of knowledge in what the Christian bible actually says.\n I'm not talking about physical things in this thread. A true believer wouldn't care that much about those. So, someone killing in Falwell's name or at his behest OR even doing the opposite and helping is IRRELEVANT to the topic.\n \n \n This of course is fine for me, a non believer, in wanting hard 'proofs'. But odd in supposedly self-professing believers where not believing will result in a horrible, eternal fate.\n \n I hope where ever Falwell is, it's segregated. I'm sure he'd prefer that given his history.",

   "Falwell was a false prophet and had a twisted view of Christianity. You even admitted that.\n According to Chrisitianity (as laid out in the bible you say you know so much about) such people are Evil and will be damned.\n They lead people astray and eventually to hell itself. The blind leading the blind. \n \n Any Christian would find such horrific.\n Yet, you seem to down play this. You're more concerned with PHYSICAL (death of people) issues than Spiritual (eternity) ones in this discussion.\n\n \n Zardoz, I don't know who and how many \"spritual deaths\" Falwell caused. Neither do you (no matter how much you think you do). The point here is that you're expecting me to take him to task for these \"spiritual deaths\" (as you say), but no one could ever quantify the effect he's had, or not had, on society in this way. I'll disagree with him views, but I'm not going to be foolish here and act as though I can read minds and know what subjective damage he's done. If you prefer to go on things for which there's no concrete evidence, knock yourself out. \n \n But more importantly, your take on Falwell being a \"false prophet\" and \"twisted view of Christianity\" reveals that you are seeing this in only an all-or-nothing way, which isn't realistic at all. SOME of what Falwell preached was obviously wrong. But not all of it. When Falwell preached that someone must trust in Christ to have eternal life, that's not at all being a false prophet, IMO. That's pretty straightforward Christian teaching. It is actually very rare to find a leader in Christianity that is totally wrong in every way. And I dare say there's no Christian leader that is probably right on everything. I don't agree with you that Falwell had a twisted view of Christianity in every way. In SOME aspects he was wrong, in some he wasn't. Don't confuse my point--that he has soured the taste of Christianity--with the idea that he was entirely wrong. I suspect you've passed your judgment on Falwell without reading a single sermon he ever posted, or a single article. You've probably done zilch research on the man, choosing instead to base your opinion on things said by people that hate him. That's what you've based your \"false prophet\" assertion on. \n \n \nYou are a pseudo-Christian (as are many Christians) because you do not follow every little aspect of Christianity, prefering to favor one meaning/ interpretation over others and even over the whole.\n \n In the end, I find it ironic you're attempting to defend this man. After all, you're the type he'd state is causing the world to decay and suffer. He'd also ask you to repent of your heretical ways. You won't be in his heaven.\n\n \n For a self-professed \"non-believer\", you sure seem overly-concerned whether people are pseudo or real Christians. But that's your axe .... er, opinion, to grind. \n \n One more thing--if my refusing to join in the Falwell-is-dead parade and not partaking in your all-or-nothing mentality about this is what you call \"defending\" him, I'll take that as a complement. You pick and choose Bible truths as they fit your statements, just like you accuse Christians (er, \"pseudo\" Christians) of doing; after all, you gladly invoke the scripture on false prophets, but conveniently ignore that we should be forgiving toward Falwell. Funny that you seem to have ignored the importance of THAT hallmark of Christianity, in your rush to grind your axe. I DO disagree with Falwell, on MANY, things he said. The difference between you and I is that I've done so carefully and am not going to throw the baby out with the bathwather. It's called making a fair assessment. So if that's \"defending\" him, then so be it.",

All Christians are called to take to task fellow 'Christians' for their actions and beliefs. \n The simple prrof is in the pudding for Christianity. IF one preaches a different gospel other than the one taught, they are heretics. ANY who follow such teachers suffer the same fate as the teacher.\n It A then B. Simple logic, even when talking about spiritual issues.\n From a Christian viewpoint, going to hell is worse than simply being killed.\n \n You were wanting to compare Spiritual with Physical.\n \n \nBut more importantly, your take on Falwell being a \"false prophet\" and \"twisted view of Christianity\" reveals that you are seeing this in only an all-or-nothing way, which isn't realistic at all.\n\n Such is what Christianity has ALWAYS been about. All or nothing.\n You try to deny thins as do many contemporary 'self proclaimed' Christians...yet, you don't know what your own book says, you don't follow it (you even admit that). So, what's your point?\n You're a pseudo Christian. Like Shadowpikachu and others. You self label yourself as a christian yet deny essentials or claim they are unimportant compared to others. You chase after what you want to hear and accept what you prefer. Pich and choose.\n \n \nSOME of what Falwell preached was obviously wrong. But not all of it. When Falwell preached that someone must trust in Christ to have eternal life, that's not at all being a false prophet, IMO.\n\n A fly spoils the ointment. False doctrins detract from the rest and lay a foundation for further error. What you're saying is one can get some truth by listening to a liar who occasionally tells the truth (and refuses to admit that he lies). This requires discernment that most don't have.\n Your own bible goes on about this.\n \n \nThat's pretty straightforward Christian teaching. It is actually very rare to find a leader in Christianity that is totally wrong in every way. And I dare say there's no Christian leader that is probably right on everything.\n\n This muddy's the waters and diminishes the point. 'Well we all make mistakes' so it's okay for someone to profess not to to do so. \n \n \nI don't agree with you that Falwell had a twisted view of Christianity in every way. In SOME aspects he was wrong, in some he wasn't.\n\n Addresed above. SOME is too much according to your bible. \n \n \nDon't confuse my point--that he has soured the taste of Christianity--with the idea that he was entirely wrong. I suspect you've passed your judgment on Falwell without reading a single sermon he ever posted, or a single article.\n\n I've read his books and the books of those who worked for him whe became disenfranchised with his demeanor and preachings. Did Falwell say things I agree with, did he support agendas I did? Sure.\n Would I rather have you as my neighbor than him. Assuredly. Even though I disagree with much of what you say and believe, from your postings, I'd have less to fear from you.\n All humans can judge, We do it quite often. Knowing what your bible says on these subjects. I don't have problems in doing so. I am judged, you are judged. We judge each other even in the context of this thread.\n \n \nYou've probably done zilch research on the man, choosing instead to base your opinion on things said by people that hate him. That's what you've based your \"false prophet\" assertion on.\n\n LOL. \n A false prophet is a false teacher. \n I've done quite a bit of research on him. He, Pat Robertson and all like him.\n \n \nFor a self-professed \"non-believer\", you sure seem overly-concerned whether people are pseudo or real Christians. But that's your axe .... er, opinion, to grind.\n\n I just like to point out the hypocracy of your system and beliefs.\n Christians are ever increasinly not Christian.\n They're selective in what they believe.\n Eventually, one can't tell who is what.\n You, Arch, Matthew S, Shadowpikachu and dozens others here all profress to be Christians. There's a world of difference between each of you. If your bible says that 'narrow is the path...' who's teachings should I follow. If I go to your church or with Matthew S, where sexual immorality is tolerated, is that good becuase I'm still getting 'some truth'? How about to Arch's where an adhearance to one form of dogmatic beliefs are taught as doctrine or even INRI's catholicism which also does the same.\n \n \nOne more thing--if my refusing to join in the Falwell-is-dead parade and not partaking in your all-or-nothing mentality about this is what you call \"defending\" him, I'll take that as a complement. You pick and choose Bible truths as they fit your statements, just like you accuse Christians (er, \"pseudo\" Christians) of doing; after all, you gladly invoke the scripture on false prophets, but conveniently ignore that we should be forgiving toward Falwell.\n\n Falwell never asked for forgiveness. The Christ himself NEVER offered forgiveness to an unrepentant person. Calling even the pharasies and religious officials out for their unrepentant ways.\n You (and Catholics for exampls) constantly forget this little detail.\n One doesn't continually forgive those who don't want to be forgiven because they don't think they've done any wrong. Paul spoke of this also when he instructed followers to shun fellows who refused to be called to correction.\n \n \nFunny that you seem to have ignored the importance of THAT hallmark of Christianity, in your rush to grind your axe. I DO disagree with Falwell, on MANY, things he said. The difference between you and I is that I've done so carefully and am not going to throw the baby out with the bathwather. It's called making a fair assessment. So if that's \"defending\" him, then so be it.\n\n No axe grinding here other than to inform others of the nonsense indemic in your professed faith system.\n \n All I've done is use the same book that you guys (Falwell included) to state that those who believe this will suffer X fate.\n Simple If/Then logic.\n \n You preach something that contradicts the book you say you follow, then you suffer the fate listed in the book you say you follow.\n Pretty simple.\n Falwell contradicts the teachings. He sufferes the same fate he'd say others would suffer for doing so.",

   "Prove it.\n\n ??? Seriously. \n This shows a extraordinary lack of biblical knowledge and simply reinforces the notion that you merely read some of the red parts and decide to interpret that, leaving all other biblical commentary to the side.\n For someone to have professed such study of the bible as you previously have professed, I'm dumfounded if this is your ownly response.\n Constantly I'm reminded that my initial assessments of you are correct.\n \n However, \n 1 Corinthias 5, Expelling an immoral brother.\n Can't do that unless you've policed yourselves and judged him 1st to determine that he was in error. \n 5:9-13\n '...Is it not those inside the church whom you are to judge? God judges those outside. \"Purge the evil person from among you.\" '\n \n \n Nearly every instance of a call to beware of false prophets and teachers is a call for self policing. To correct those who err as Paul corrected Peter (In public when he erred) as the Chist sought to correct his brethern to the rightious path. \n There are calls to raise a child up in the way they should go with correct teachings. There are calls to correct an errant brother when they have done wrong and calls to shun them or kick them out when they refuse to listen to good advice. There are calls to flee immorality and flee a false teacher. \n Asking for these 'proofs' is a call for me to read the majority of the bible to you. \n The whole jist is to get people on the 'Straight and narrow path' rather than give them an out with a simple cry of 'well we're all sinners/ everyone does it/ who am I to judge'.\n Sounds like Cain...\"Am I my brothers keeper?\"\n \n \nNo, I think it's all your view is about, and you're using the \"exposing-Christian-hypocrisy\" canard as an excuse. You say you aren't here to grind an axe, yet you give yourself away on that because you jump at any chance you can on the hypocrisy thing.\n\n What you're actually doing is judging my heart. You do this often. A christian isn't supposed to do this as judging one's heart (intent) is forbidden and is for God to judge.\n I rejoice that I am not bound by such a standard and doubly rejoice in the fact that a self professed 'Christian' doesn't know what his own bible says. That a self professed Christian, in ignorance, breaks the rules of his own God.\n But, then again, you're a pseudo-Christian. In name only. And you pick and choose what you wish to listen too as it tickles your ears.\n Your ONLY defense is to attack the messenger. To state my intentions are to 'grind axes'. LOL!\n \n \nI've run into lots of people who think they are on a mission to do that with religious people. It's pretty funny, actually, because I've never known a person who wasn't a hypocrite in calling someone ELSE a hypocrite. You're no exception. If you've ever been hypocritical at any point in your life on anything, then you're a hypocrite by trying to expose hypocrisy among Christians. And you have. That's the funny thing about being out to call religious people hypocrites. It will backfire on you every time, because you're really no better yourself.\n\n That you again for violating the rules in your bible. \n Here you're muddying the waters. Making personal attacks against my nature 'We all are hypoctrits' as a cowardly defense for your faiths hypocracy.\n Rather than discuss the issue (where I'm correct on) you try to attack the messenger. Weak. VERY WEAK. \n I have not judged your faith hypocritically for one. (the old plank speck bible verse on judging hypocritically) But, by what your bible states. Any here who care to read the thing will know I speak the truth. Even many of your fellow Christians will note so. \n \n \nWhat's equally interesting is that, so far, you resort to this 'exposing hypocrisy' trick, rather than debate the issue. We need to know YOUR view, not the view of Christians. if you want to start a discussion on Christian hypocrisy, then start a thread (though you'd be a hypocrite for doing so), but stop trying to hijack every thread around to to an off-topic point.\n\n LMAO.\n This is just an example of you side stepping the 'issue'. Debate? You give the seal of approval to the demagogues and false teachers in your midst. You fail to heed the callings of your own faith system because you chose to. And all you can do as defense is to judge my intentions and try to switch the tables in an attack on the messenger as you have no defense.\n \n \n \nThat's right. There are very few people in the world that are wrong on everything. Falwell was wrong. He wasn't a liar because he believed what he was saying.\n\n Forgetting what a liar is. Actually thinking Falwell believed what he preached.\n He taught untruth. He's been corrected in the past on this by others (fellow Christians who pointed out his errors). He chose to ignore it (although, ironically, he's apologized when he went too far...why apologize IF you believe what your preach? Sounds like a weak Christian lacking faith...or someone knowingly pushing a false message to ingorant followers who are too stupid to read their own bibles).\n FYI, the Fly spoiling the ointment was 'bible talk'. Elementary level stuff too. Meaning a little error (as in a small amount of yeast will leven the whole bread) will pervert the whole thing. A teacher should take heed for this and seek to preach ONLY the TRUTH.\n But, rather than follow these instructions in your own bible, you make excusses for them and dismiss them with a false 'well everyone does it' which is ######## as you don't know for a fact that such happens.\n I'm also not talking about this mythical everything. I'm talking about the bible and doctrine. Not miscellaneous dogma, not common mistakes. But, essentials to your alleged faith system.\n \n \nIt's becoming abundantly clear that you pick and choose whatever things you want the Bible to say as it fits your agenda. Just like you accuse others of doing. Gee, that makes you a hypocrite. Yep, there it is again! emoticon_xgood \n\n As of yet, I've seen NO biblical verses to support your 'Christian' notions even though you prommissed some before in another thread. You also have no proof of what I 'pick and choose'.\n If you want MORE biblical verses to support my statement beyond 1 Corin. 5, I could do so. \n The only thing abundantly clear is you have no defense. You don't really know what your own bible states beyond a general 'vague' thruthiness feel to it that you probably got from others teachings rather than all that personal study you said you did.\n You should also look into the definition of hypocracy because I also think you don't know what it means. Your attempt to use it here to state I pick and choose what I want the bible to say is pretty lame and far from the truth. ore so considering your own ignorance on things scriptual.\n I've stated \n \n \nI don't believe you. Your posts are too polarized against him for you to have done that.\n\n LMAO.\n That's ****ing pathetic. \n A polarized posting doen't show a lack of reading his books.\n Another fallacious argument. Seems that's ALL you have been capable of doing. Pushing false cause and effect.\n I suppose that if one were to read Mein Kampf and come off with a negative review of it, then one obviously I hadn't read it either.\n emoticon_rolleyes",
