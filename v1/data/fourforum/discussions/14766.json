   "You know--EZ, Archie, Gansao, Jyoshu, and the rest--you can stamp your feet and wipe your sweaty foreheads like Fredric March in Inherit the Wind, and wave your forefingers in the air and tell us how all we heathen blasphemers going to end up in a Fiery Perdition... but there's not one of us heathen blasphemers who's been convinced by a single friggin syllable you've spoken here in what... well, we can check the timestamps, can't we? Five, seven, ten years?\n \n Oh, sure, some of us pit-passengers have been here as long as you have--but we don't come here for the same reason as you do. We're not here \"doing the work\" of an imaginary employer, waking up in the middle of the night (funny how you guys always seem to post in unison at 1-2 in the morning) just to damn others to hell and call them 5th grade baby names. (\"Busted!\" Oooh! \"Cooties\" back at ya!)\n \n Many of us are here in search of intellectual discourse and honest debate. Others are here just to be amused at the sight of you guys trying to reach your big Invisible Man on an olde tyme crank-up phone that doesn't seem to work, howling like the dying dinosaurs you are, and watch you pathetically sully the words and philosophy of a man who MAY have existed--but was most assuredly NOT the offspring of some Guy-in-the-Sky virgin-defiler--by corrupting his alleged words into dung, more putrid than Paul ever managed to do, in your attempts to justify your tiny-souled, potty-mouthed, insulting ravings.\n \n I hereby challenge anyone who has read your posts to come forth and claim they were changed by your non-rational so-called \"arguments.\"\n \n You're already dead. Why don't you get yourselves buried, and save some air for the rest of us trying to live LIFE?",

He is one of the few christians on this site who can actually have a rational debate, clearly express his opinion and why he thinks it is right, and yet respect the rights of others to have opinions that differ from his. \n \n Be careful about painting with such a broad brush.",
