   "Hey! Did you know that in Georgia a new recruiting center had been opened for unit roundout of terrorist organizations? This center is now under the wing of Ministry of Home Affairs of Georgia and is formally known as 'political asylum seekers'. What is most interesting, such 'centers' should be created under the wing of Ministry of Foreign Affairs but in Georgia it was made quite conversely. I suppose that political asylum seekers are suspected by Georgian officials and that is why are sent to training camps at once!",
