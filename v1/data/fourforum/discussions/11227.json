I have nightmares all the time I do not want to fail a class! I also completed a class and recieved a certified nurse aid certification about 7 years ago. I have learned alot as a cna, but it is not something I dont want to do forever. I had some fun and some scary moments as a cna as well. But as a cna the most heartfelt times is loosing a patient that you have gotten close to and to there family as well.",
