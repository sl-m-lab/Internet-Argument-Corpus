We are asking that this restriction be removed so that the right to marriage is allowed to both same-sex and opposite-sex couples.

In this sense, if marriage is considered a \"special\" right, then we are asking for access to the same special right that you already have.\n \n But even if you looked at it from a different perspective, assuming that same-sex marriage and opposite-sex marriage are seperate rights, then it could be said that currently everyone has the special right of opposite-sex marriage, and we are arguing that everyone also deserves the special right to same-sex marriage.\n \n So if marriage is a \"special\" right, then either we're asking to remove one of the restrictions from that right, or we're asking for an additional special right tailored toward same-sex coupes to match the special right already held by opposite-sex couples.
