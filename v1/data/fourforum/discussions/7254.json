It's like Saddam's palace in Bagdad! At leats the church I attend we are helping another church in Wales spreding the word and we alose do a Mexico trip to help orphans every week or so. Plus these are all independent ministries, led by families who attend the church. They just let people know about the opprotunties to help. They dont advertise like a church down the street named Crossroads (google search it). They have a Starbucks in their a Starbucks!! Oh and for wednesday teen bible study guys go their to pick up chicks. Oh and lets not forget the $12,000 Harley Davidson Motorcycle giveaway. Ugh.
