These reservations have Tribal Governments and Police forces which are beholding to no white authorities at all. So why is it Washington's fault if the local authorities who are on the scene aren't enforcing the existing laws that are designed to protect all citizens, including their own women? It seems a bit presumptuous to blame the Government if a few scumbags are traveling in search of specific victims. \n \n But I'd like to see some evidence that white rapists are traveling cross country and planning rape vacations in order to get them some indian meat. Nothing you posted proves that's the case at all. This is more likely local boys who get drunk and decide to go start trouble at the local reservation that's 20 miles outside of their South Dakota town, or some such foolishness. Please prove your case before you slander all white men.",

So your example doesn't conflict with my point at all. But my point stands and could be confirmed by polling every adoptive couple who seeks a baby in any given year. The vast majority of any race polled, to the tune of 99% I would wager, would say that if given their first preference, they would prefer a child of their own race. Of course, if that isn't possible due to the high number of abortions which limit the number of babies that are available, loving parents of any race will take babies of any race. \n \n My point isn't racist at all, it is acknowledging reality and the human nature which causes us to be drawn to those who look like we do.

(Stolley, 1993) \n \n * An estimated 15% of the 36,000 adoptions of foster children in FY 1998 were transracial or transcultural adoptions. (US DHHS, 2000) \n",

Just as you can't prove a negative, you can't prove what ALL adoptive parents have in their minds as their first choice.

   "Airbrushing out Mary Jo Kopechne\n Only a Kennedy could get away with it.\n By Mark Steyn\n \n We are enjoined not to speak ill of the dead. But, when an entire nation - or, at any rate, its \"mainstream\" media culture - declines to speak the truth about the dead, we are certainly entitled to speak ill of such false eulogists. In its coverage of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy's passing, America's TV networks are creepily reminiscent of those plays Sam Shepard used to write about some dysfunctional inbred hardscrabble Appalachian household where there's a baby buried in the backyard but everyone agreed years ago never to mention it.\n \n In this case, the unmentionable corpse is Mary Jo Kopechne, 1940-1969. If you have to bring up the, ah, circumstances of that year of decease, keep it general, keep it vague. As Kennedy flack Ted Sorensen put it in Time magazine: \"Both a plane crash in Massachusetts in 1964 and the ugly automobile accident on Chappaquiddick Island in 1969 almost cost him his life.\"\n \n That's the way to do it! An \"accident,\" \"ugly\" in some unspecified way, just happened to happen - and only to him, nobody else. Ted's the star, and there's no room to namecheck the bit players. What befell him was . . . a thing, a place. As Joan Vennochi wrote in the Boston Globe: \"Like all figures in history - and like those in the Bible, for that matter - Kennedy came with flaws. Moses had a temper. Peter betrayed Jesus. Kennedy had Chappaquiddick, a moment of tremendous moral collapse.\"\n \n Actually, Peter denied Jesus, rather than \"betrayed\" him, but close enough for Catholic-lite Massachusetts. And if Moses having a temper never led him to leave some gal at the bottom of the Red Sea, well, let's face it, he doesn't have Ted's tremendous legislative legacy, does he? Perhaps it's kinder simply to airbrush out of the record the name of the unfortunate complicating factor on the receiving end of that moment of \"tremendous moral collapse.\" When Kennedy cheerleaders do get around to mentioning her, it's usually to add insult to fatal injury. As Teddy's biographer Adam Clymer wrote, Edward Kennedy's \"achievements as a senator have towered over his time, changing the lives of far more Americans than remember the name Mary Jo Kopechne.\"\n \n You can't make an omelette without breaking chicks, right? I don't know how many lives the senator changed - he certainly changed Mary Jo's - but you're struck less by the precise arithmetic than by the basic equation: How many changed lives justify leaving a human being struggling for breath for up to five hours pressed up against the window in a small, shrinking air pocket in Teddy's Oldsmobile? If the senator had managed to change the lives of even more Americans, would it have been okay to leave a couple more broads down there? Hey, why not? At the Huffington Post, Melissa Lafsky mused on what Mary Jo \"would have thought about arguably being a catalyst for the most successful Senate career in history . . . Who knows - maybe she'd feel it was worth it.\" What true-believing liberal lass wouldn't be honored to be dispatched by that death panel?\n \n We are all flawed, and most of us are weak, and in hellish moments, at a split-second's notice, confronting the choice that will define us ever after, many of us will fail the test. Perhaps Mary Jo could have been saved; perhaps she would have died anyway. What is true is that Edward Kennedy made her death a certainty. When a man (if you'll forgive the expression) confronts the truth of what he has done, what does honor require? Six years before Chappaquiddick, in the wake of Britain's comparatively very minor \"Profumo scandal,\" the eponymous John Profumo, Her Majesty's Secretary of State for War, resigned from the House of Commons and the Queen's Privy Council, and disappeared amid the tenements of the East End to do good works washing dishes and helping with children's playgroups, in anonymity, for the last 40 years of his life. With the exception of one newspaper article to mark the centenary of his charitable mission, he never uttered another word in public again.\n \n Ted Kennedy went a different route. He got kitted out with a neck brace and went on TV and announced the invention of the \"Kennedy curse,\" a concept that yoked him to his murdered brothers as a fellow victim - and not, as Mary Jo perhaps realized in those final hours, the perpetrator. He dared us to call his bluff, and, when we didn't, he made all of us complicit in what he'd done. We are all prey to human frailty, but few of us get to inflict ours on an entire nation.\n \n His defenders would argue that he redeemed himself with his \"progressive\" agenda, up to and including health-care \"reform.\" It was an odd kind of \"redemption\": In a cooing paean to the senator on a cringe-makingly obsequious edition of NPR's Diane Rehm Show, Edward Klein of Newsweek fondly recalled that one of Ted's \"favorite topics of humor was, indeed, Chappaquiddick itself. He would ask people, 'Have you heard any new jokes about Chappaquiddick?'\"\n \n Terrific! Who was that lady I saw you with last night?\n \n Beats me!\n \n Why did the Last Lion cross the road?\n \n To sleep it off!\n \n What do you call 200 Kennedy sycophants at the bottom of a Chappaquiddick pond? A great start, but bad news for NPR guest-bookers! \"He was a guy's guy,\" chortled Edward Klein. Which is one way of putting it.\n \n When a man is capable of what Ted Kennedy did that night in 1969 and in the weeks afterwards, what else is he capable of? An NPR listener said the senator's passing marked \"the end of civility in the U.S. Congress.\" Yes, indeed. Who among us does not mourn the lost \"civility\" of the 1987 Supreme Court hearings? Considering the nomination of Judge Bork, Ted Kennedy rose on the Senate floor and announced that \"Robert Bork's America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit down at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens' doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution . . . \"\n \n Whoa! \"Liberals\" (in the debased contemporary American sense of the term) would have reason to find Borkian jurisprudence uncongenial, but to suggest the judge and former solicitor-general favored re-segregation of lunch counters is a slander not merely vile but so preposterous that, like his explanation for Chappaquiddick, only a Kennedy could get away with it. If you had to identify a single speech that marked \"the end of civility\" in American politics, that's a shoo-in.\n \n If a towering giant cares so much about humanity in general, why get hung up on his carelessness with humans in particular? For Kennedy's comrades, the cost was worth it. For the rest of us, it was a high price to pay. And, for Ted himself, who knows? He buried three brothers, and as many nephews, and as the years took their toll, it looked sometimes as if the only Kennedy son to grow old had had to grow old for all of them. Did he truly believe, as surely as Melissa Lafsky and Co., that his indispensability to the republic trumped all else? That Camelot - that \"fleeting wisp of glory,\" that \"one brief shining moment\" - must run forever, even if \"How to Handle a Woman\" gets dropped from the score. The senator's actions in the hours and days after emerging from that pond tell us something ugly about Kennedy the man. That he got away with it tells us something ugly about American public life.",
