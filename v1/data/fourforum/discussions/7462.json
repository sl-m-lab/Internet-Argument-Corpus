   "I personally think this theory is outdated now and a new one is needed. There are too many holes in it. I use to be a firm believer and than after watching how many sciences use this as an absolute dogma to which it was argued in court during the time evolution wasn't being taught in schools that no science should have an absolute dogma. Isn't this kinda of contradictory? I can understand why people don't want creationism to be taught with how it refers to religion really. However, why not? Shouldn't we open people's minds to new ideas and perhaps one day come up with a better theory than both of these for science? I mean isn't the Big Bang theory kinda religious in a way?\n \n Here an interesting read \"Darwin's Black Box\" Good book that speaks about the flaws in Darwin's Theory of evolution. It really asks the right questions and is good to pick up and read at a local book store.\n \n (I hope this was the right place to post this thread...forgive me if its the wrong place)",

   "The problem is that evolution explains what it sets out to explain. Creationists attack it for failing to explain that which it was never supposed to. Evolution does not have holes in the sense of parts of the thoery that are incorrect, it is merely incomplete. One can, of course, fill those holes with speculation and faith, but that is not science, and should not be taught in science classes. By all means be precise about what evolution explains and what it does not, and also explain the other theories, such as that of the big bang, which form part of our understanding of the universe.\n \n I'm not sure where you get the idea that big bang theory is religious, it is based on observation and a small amount of extrapolation based on mathematical models of the early universe.",

   "Well, that is more of a personal understanding I have I admit. I'm supposed to believe the Big Bang began due to a large mixture of what would later become planets and other objects in space. The 'bang' happened and everything spread across the cosmos. However, I've always wondered what was before the Big Bang? What created all the debris? Also couldn't there be a more profound theory than the big bang out there? This is just my understanding from what I've read about the theory and would welcome someone who has studied it more intently. (BTW realized I don't think I answered your question that well, I see it as religious in how this debris or gasses that would later become are universe or that of many universes just exploded or was there. Its hard to explain how the debris has always been there without some focus on an immortal being.)\n \n Also evolution I can undestand explains how adaptation works very effectively. However, when we go to the cellular level it can't explain things anymore. I see creationism also more along the lines of the Big Bang theory. Where things occured spontaneously instead of at a slow pace like in evolution. The reason I point out these theories is that why don't we have more than these? We need more in order to question everything more effectively. The theory of evolution just needs to be reevaluated. Darwin at the time knew nothing of cells or atoms. However, I do not completely cast off this theory or any others. I just see them all as another explanation and a attempt to better understand our world and perhaps others. I believe that we should have more than one theory and perhaps urge people to question all of em.\n \n Just like how people believed that the earth was the center of the universe and that got disproved. Perhaps something else will get disproved? People also say that atoms are the most basic building blocks and than they find something thats smaller. (I unfortunately don't remember the exact name) All I ask is that everyone should question these and at the same time hold true to these theories and not entirely abandon them.\n \n I will admit I am no expert or a scientist and I welcome people to better explain these theories to me. However, I will alway see these theories as...just theories.",

   "I do agree with you on some of your points pickle. However, I've been told that creationism, although having been brought up from a religious point of view, is more along the lines of how the world has gone through tramatic changes and is much younger than it really is. This can be a valid theory. There have been reports about how plant life and animals have been affected horrible by natural dissasters that happen in the blink of an eye. Such as mountains blowing thier tops. That is just some evidence to support the conclusions. I do not however think that every point in this theory is correct. I think the same about the evolution theory. This theory however, has had the benifit of being around longer and asking more questions. So it has more evidence than other theories. You might say that since creationism is linked in ways to religious points of views it has been around much longer. However, people are just now trying to see if they can explain what \"God did it in less than a week\" in science terms. I say give this a chance, I don't say base every single time in education on it. I do say look at and try to accept some of the points and evidence it had brought to us. Than question the hell out of it! emoticon_xgood \n \n You could even look at the less than a week creation story as something else. Maybe instead of 6 days, it took 6 trillion years?\n \n To what you said about how teaching creationism would be just as valid as the earth being flat. That would be bit wrong due to how the world can be revolved around. It could be said the world is flat in many other terms such as the human mind seeing everything as their version of the world being flat such as the whole world is selfish.\n \n The whole world is round and has been proven through much evidence. However, but this is strictly scfi kind of thing, as said above there are many version of how the world can still be being flat. Physically speaking the world is an oval and ships on the ocean can go faster by going more north or south and thus reaching a destination much more quickly.\n \n Absolute bottom line is that Creationism is seen as a chaotic tumble of the world forming in many different ways. Evolution is the slow adaptations of everything on the planet. The Big Bang is the explosion of gasses which than flew outwars into the universes to form planets and stars. All of these theories have weakness and strengths.\n \n Creationism - Some evidence proves that the world is indeed chaotic and can be changed dratically thorough natural dissasters. However, how could this create life? (As I've said I have only studied evolution and this is the stuff I could come up with for Creationism. I am open to new idea for the weaknesses in the theory)\n \n Evolution - Explains and supports evidence of how men evolved through the ages. However, it cannot explain to almost no degree how cellular life changes through evolution. The Human Eye for example does many things. (Unfortunately I can not explain this whole process as good as the book I read. Darwin's Black Box. Look this book up and read pages 18-22 about the human eye and the complex process of biochemistry compared to evolution)\n \n Big Bang - Giant ball of gas explodes to bring the universes into existence. What was before this giant ball of gas? Why was it there?\n \n I hoped this answered some of your questions. If it didn't please post again. emoticon_xgood",

   "MTKnight: In your references to evolution you consistently come back to refering to what Darwin said. Darwin made his contributions almost a century and a half ago now and while he made the important step of suggesting the underlying idea of evolution- life changes gradually over time due to adoption of favourable variations within a popualtion much of the fine detail was far beyond the grasp of the science of his time. Even the basic mechanisms of hereditary were unknown to him.\n \n If you are going to comment on the depth of explaination evolution provides you need to refer to much more modern material to appreciate was is actually known and not known and understand the things we will never find out about past life.\n \n On the pace of earth history do not fall into the trap of thinking of evolution as a slow gradual process on the relative scale of the age of the earth as it has operated at various rates through time, and some events that can only be described as catastrophic have shaped the course of evolution from time to time.\n \n Also on Darwin's Black Box recall that biochemistry is not generally at odds with the notion of evolution but Behe himself is. The Hypothesis of Irreducable complexity has been shown to be wrong by his most vaunted example of the bacterial flagellum being shown not to be irreducably complex- a number of its componets function, independently, as a waste pump for the organism. \n \n Finally irreducable complexity is not an arguement against evolution, but that its effects are incomplete as a means to explain the nature of structures and functions of life. Into this void Behe arbitarily inserts the intelligent designer, rather curiously without any evidence of what said designers mechanism for interacting with life is or even evidence that the designer exists at all. I find this most peculiar of all (or should I say ironic?) as Behe has created his example in the first place by the application of the scientific method.",

   "There seems to be a complete lack of understanding of the big bang theory here, and a complete failure to understand the nature of science. Science is based on observation of the universe, creationism is based on a book. Sure you can just about, with a little trickery, fit the facts into the creation story, especially when you have the handy \"God made it do that\" to fall back on. Big bang theory doesn't talk about gas exploding, it is about an actual expansion of space itself, and about massive amounts of energy. At the beginning of the universe there was no matter, only energy. As for what was before the big bang, you are correct that this is beyond the realms of science, though a previous \"big crunch\" - the end of a universe, has been hypothesised. Those of us of the theistic persuasion are inclined to see the big bang as The Beginning, and hence God's act of creation.",

   "OccamsRazor you do have many points I certainly agree with. I did mention that Darwin's theory has been around a lot longer than some of the other theories. I was implying by that the future heridity findings and other information that would strengthen the evolutionary theory. \n \n I will admit I have not read many modern evolutionary material. I do agree with you about how Behe has it out against the evolutionary theory and that some catastrophic events have taken place in evolutionary history. I still say though that Evolution needs to be looked at even more and new theories of these 'holes' that biochemistry has made in the theory need to be covered up.\n \n However, unlike Behe I am not a creationist. I do believe in God and that evolution and the Big Bang were works He used to create are world. Also to Jo Bennet I do agree with you with how science is and that you are right about the Big Bang theory. So I do apologize for saying there was big ball of gas in the begining and thank you for educating me.\n \n Still creationism could easily be placed in high schools or just talked about in classrooms. I do not agree that it should be placed in a text book and studied by every student, but should be taught as an alternative. Maybe it could be looked at for a month or even a week and evolution should very well have double or even triple that teaching time. I also do not and would not try to fall back on the phrase \"God made it do that\" \n \n I do not say creationism is the absolute best alternative we have to evolution, I do say that right now there isn't that popular of an alternative. I figure if people look at theories and learn about them and someone would teach them the weakness of it, we might be able to get more questions and maybe even answers. I am still a student and admit I do not know as much as some people, but back in High School evolution was taught in my science class without talking about its weaknesses. This was done in a private religious school. In fact I never heard of creationism or the weaknesses of evolution till near the end of high school.\n \n The main point I'm trying to say is that we should not look at something as if its the only valid explanation. We should question the hell out of it. And keep questioning. Finding every weakness in every theory and try to find better ideas about those weaknesses. You can call the theory incomplete or weak in certain areas. All I ask is that we should have more than one theory on areas that aren't exactly concrete. I can understand not having another theory about why we don't fly off the Earth. Gravity is much more concrete of a theory, but I would say if another person comes along with another theory that can be proven in some ways and answers the questions that the old theory doesn't answer than we should study that one too.\n \n I am young and immature. I do enjoy asking questions and keeping my mind open. I hope this answers some questions and brings up more. emoticon_xgood \n (I hope this answers more questions...and doesn't bring up too many more questions. emoticon_confused emoticon_xdonno )\n \n BTW if I still failed to answer all of your questions please tell me.

   "MTKnight: This theory [Creationism] however, has had the benifit of being around longer and asking more questions. \n\n \n Although it is true that Creationism has been around longer than modern evolutionary theory, it is false that Creationism has therefore been asking more questions. Quite the opposite: Creationism has been blindly accepted as religious truth by religious people who do not question their unsupported religious beliefs.\n \n \nMTKnight: So it has more evidence than other theories.\n\n \n Creationism has no scientific evidence supporting it, and numerous scientific evidences that directly contradict it.\n \n \nMTKnight: You might say that since creationism is linked in ways to religious points of views it has been around much longer.\n\n \n No. The two aren't merely linked: Creationism IS the Biblical story of creation.\n \n \nMTKnight: Physically speaking the world is an oval and ships on the ocean can go faster by going more north or south and thus reaching a destination much more quickly.\n\n \n You're confused. Traveling a shorter distance by going north or south some, instead of going \"straight\" to the destination, doesn't have to do with an oval: it works even on a perfect sphere. The shortest distance between two points on a spherical surface is that which travels along a great circle (geodesic, I believe, is another term).\n \n \n \nMTKnight: Evolution - Explains and supports evidence of how men evolved through the ages. However, it cannot explain to almost no degree how cellular life changes through evolution. The Human Eye for example does many things. (Unfortunately I can not explain this whole process as good as the book I read. Darwin's Black Box. Look this book up and read pages 18-22 about the human eye and the complex process of biochemistry compared to evolution)\n\n \n I already have. Now, what exactly is your claim? That the human eye is irreducibly complex? Show me where Behe says that. He doesn't.\n \n Are you aware that the various \"biochemicals\" Behe mentions are not unique to the eye? Here is an exchange I had on another board about this. I am DNAunion in the following exchanges. After that is more material I found while looking into the matter.\n \n \n ***********************************\n \nDNAunion: ...(10) All photoreceptors use the seven-transmembrane proteins known as opsins - and they all contain a vitamin A-derived chromophore that absorbs light - and they all use G protein-mediated signal transduction. . . . \n\n \n \nAntievolutionist: Okay Mister Darwin, where did these seven-transmembrane proteins come from. Oh yeah, scientific randomness, spontaneous (not instanteous, but over generations) generation of complex biochemistry. \n\n \n Even a certain bacterium has a seven-spanning transmembrane protein, called bacteriorhodopsin, that responds to incoming photons (also, there are more than 150 different seven-spanning transmembrane proteins). \n \n \n\"A large and important family of integral proteins is defined by the presence of seven membrane-spanning [alpha] helices. More than 150 such \"seven-spanning\" membrane proteins have been identified. This class of integral protein is typified by bacteriorhodopsin, a protein found in a photosynthetic bacterium. ... Other seven-spanning membrane proteins include the opsins (eye proteins that absorb light), cell-surface receptors for many hormones, and receptors for odorous molecules.\" (Molecular Cell Biology: Fourth Edition, Harvey Lodish, Arnold Berk, S. Lawrence Zipursky, Paul Matsudaira, David Baltimore, and James Darnell, W. H. Freeman & Co., 2000, p79-80) \n\n \n But there's more: bacteriorhodosin also has the vitamin-A derived chromophore retinal, just like our eyes do.\n \n \n\"To detect light, bacteriorhodopsin has as part of its structure a molecule of retinal, the same pigment molecule used to capture light energy in the human eye.\" (The World of the Cell: Third Edition, Wayne M. Becker, Jane B. Reece, and Martin F. Poenie, Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Co., 1996, p174) \n\n \n Also, it is believed that both bacteriorhodopsin and the rhodopsin in our eyes respond to a photon by retinal's converting from one of two stable isomeric forms to the other (though the cis-<trans and trans-<cis directions are opposite). \n \n \n\"According to this model [of bacteriorhodopsin's functioning], the absorption of an incoming photon of light causes one of the double bonds of all-trans retinal to isomerize to the cis conformation (step 1). \"(The World of the Cell: Third Edition, Wayne M. Becker, Jane B. Reece, and Martin F. Poenie, Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Co., 1996, p222) \n\n \n So: \n \n 1) As part of our visual system, humans have a seven-spanning transmembrane protein called rhodopsin. A certain bacterium has a similar seven-spanning transmembrane protein called bacteriorhodopsin \n \n 2) Our rhodopsin contains the vitamin-A derived chromophore called retinal. Likewise, bacteriorhodopsin also contains the vitamin-A derived chromophore called retinal. \n \n 3) In our rhodopsin, the \"throwing of the switch\" is done by an incoming photon causing retinal to isomerize from one of its stable forms to another. The same general process occurs in bacteriorhodopsin (except that retinal goes from trans to cis, instead of from cis to trans). \n \n In other words, the basic triggering mechanism used in our visual system - the first step that kicks off the rest of the cascade of events - is present in a bacterium, but there the analogous mechanism kicks off a different series of events. \n \n \n ****************************************\n \n In \"Darwin's Black Box\", Michael Behe discusses how Darwin tried to explain the evolution of our camera-type eye from a simple eyespot, apparently not finding anything in Darwin's explanation that needed to be countered. On pages 18-21 Behe explains the details of the complex visual system at the biochemical level, where he does doubt evolution's ability to create the starting point of Darwin's scenario. Those not familiar with biochemistry might wrongly believe that the molecules and mechanisms used in vision are unique to that system...another unspannable gap that science can't explain. This is not so. There are analogous molecules/mechanisms that evolution could have co-opted for use in vision. \n \n One such example is rhodopsin kinase activity. \n \n \n\"Third, while all of this is going on, metarhodopsin II is chemically modified by an enzyme called rhodopsin kinase.\" (Darwin's Black Box, Michael Behe, Free Press, 1996, p21) \n \n \n First, modification of biochemistry by the action of many different types of phosphorylating enzymes (called kinases) is quite common. So the general mechanism is nothing new or out of the ordinary. \n \n Second, the only thing left is the specific action of rhodopsin kinase, and like several other molecules/mechanisms in vision, it too is not a \"complexity island\": BARK is its \"close neighbor\". \n \n \n\"The mechanism by which rod-cell activity is controlled by rhodopsin kinase is similar to adaptation (or desensitization) of the [beta]-adrenergic receptor to high levels of hormone (see Figure 20-47). Indeed, rhodopsin kinase is very similar to [beta]-adrenergic receptor kinase (BARK), the enzyme that phosphorylates and inactivates only the ligand-occupied [beta]-andrenergic receptor, and each kinase can phosphorylate the other's substrate. Moreover, a homolog of arrestin binds to BARK-phosphorylated [beta]-andrenergic receptors, blocking their activation of G5 proteins.\" (Molecular Cell Biology: Fourth Edition, Harvey Lodish, Arnold Berk, S. Lawrence Zipursky, Paul Matsudaira, David Baltimore, and James Darnell, W. H. Freeman & Co., 2000, p957) \n \n \n Another protein Behe mentions in the complexity of vision is arrestin. Again, it is not a \"complexity island\": it has a homolog that binds to \"BARK\" molecules (which themselves are quite similar to rhodopsin kinase molecules).\n \n \n\"At high ambient light (such as noontime outdoors), the level of opsin phosphorylation is such that the protein arrestin binds to opsin. Arrestin binds to the same site of opsin as does transducin, totally blocking activation of transducin and causing a shutdown of all rod-cell activity. ... [A] homolog of arrestin binds to BARK-phosphorylated [beta]-andrenergic receptors, blocking their activation of G5 proteins.\" (Molecular Cell Biology: Fourth Edition, Harvey Lodish, Arnold Berk, S. Lawrence Zipursky, Paul Matsudaira, David Baltimore, and James Darnell, W. H. Freeman & Co., 2000, p957) \n\n \n Another of the biochemical players in vision Behe repeatedly references in cGMP. Cyclic GMP (cGMP) can adopt either of two stable forms: \"normal\" GMP (guanosine monophosphate, a nucleic acid nucleotide) and cyclic GMP. The normal form of GMP is converted into the cyclic from by an enzyme, called guanylate cyclase. Another enzyme, cGMP phosphodiesterase, serves to convert cGMP back into GMP. \n \n \n\"GTP-transducin-metarhodopsin II now binds to a protein called phosphodiesterase, located in the inner membrane of the cell. When attached to metarhodopsin II and its entourage, the phosphodiesterase acquires the chemical ability to \"cut\" a molecule of cGMP (a chemical relative of GDP and GTP).\" (Darwin's Black Box, Michael Behe, Free Press, 1996, p 20) \n\n \n But there is not just a single type of cGMP phosphodiesterase, nor is either cGMP or cGMP phosphodiesterase used only in photoreceptors. Again, more key molecules of vision that are not a \"complexity islands\".\n \n \n\"We have been interested in studying the regulation of the cGMP-binding, cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE5) in intestinal cells. PDE5 is the target for the drug sildenafil citrate, or Viagra, used in the treatment of male impotence. \n \n PDE5 is expressed in human colonic cells and in intestinal tissue and we have shown that its activity is regulated by intracellular cGMP levels in these cells...\" (http://www.mrdg.iisc.ernet.in/bundle/pde.htm) \n\n \n \n\"The expression and regulation of the cGMP-binding, cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase, PDE5, was studied in intestinal cells. ... Our results therefore represent the first study on the expression and regulation of PDE5 in intestinal tissue, and indicate that mechanisms to control its activity may have important consequences in intestinal physiology.\" (The cGMP-binding, cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE5): intestinal cell expression, regulation and role in fluid secretion, Sopory S, Kaur T, Visweswariah SS., Cell Signal. 2004 Jun;16(6):681-92) \n\n \n Two more \"players\" rendered \"unspecial\".\n \n As Behe explains (even if not explicitly), rod cells have cGMP-gated channel proteins. That is, the cyclic form of GMP binds directly to a protein that is part of the ion channel to cause a change in its functioning. \n \n First, although rod cells use cGMP-gated ion channels, some other cells use cAMP-gated ion channels, which are nearly identical (it appears the main 'structural' difference is just that one binds cAMP while the other binds cGMP - that is, the single nucleotide-binding site differs). \n \n Second, the two types of nucleotide-gated ion channels are very similar in structure to a very common ion channel called a voltage-regulated K+ channel. Both the voltage-gated K+ channel and the two types of nucleotide-gated channels : \n \n (1) exist as tetramers (i.e., they consist of four separate polypeptides that join together to form a single functional protein) \n \n (2) each of the monomeric polypeptides in the tetramers consists of six membrane-spanning alpha helices. \n \n (3) each of the channels are formed by the non-helical pore segments between helices 5 and 6. \n \n (source is: Figure 21-27 of Molecular Cell Biology: Fourth Edition, Harvey Lodish, Arnold Berk, S. Lawrence Zipursky, Paul Matsudaira, David Baltimore, and James Darnell, W. H. Freemand & Co., 2000, p934) \n \n Another player in vision rendered \"unspecial\". \n \n So far that makes cGMP, cGMP phosphodiesterase, cGMP-gated ion channels, retinal, seven-spanning transmembrane proteins (rhodopsin and bacteriorhodopsin), and rhodopsin kinase activity all \"non-special\" players in vision. That should be enough to make the point: co-option cannot be simply ruled out.\n \n \n ************************************************\n But there's more cooption related to the eye. The transparent proteins that make the lens of the eye clear are called crystallins. But contrary to the long held belief that crystallins were unique to the eye, scientists back in the 1990s found that the proteins are used by most other cells in our bodies, but there they are used for different purposes.\n \n \n\"The lens is a remarkable transparent structure filled with proteins called crystallins, which have been an object of study for more than a century. Found in great quantities in the lens and perfectly arranged to focus light, crystallins were long thought to be highly specialized lens proteins that evolved solely to allow animals to see.\n \n But as researchers studying these proteins are discovering, the evolution of the lens may have been a lot simpler than was imagined and may begin to lessons in how such complex structures arise in general.\n \n Many crystallins, scientists are finding, are actually the same proteins as the common housekeeping enzymes that govern the cell's basic chemical metabolism. One crystalline, for example, is also known from its humbler role as lactase dehydrogenase, an ordinary metabolic enzyme. Researches say these proteins evolved first for their humdrum housekeeping tasks and only later were adapted to the entirely different and specialized task of building the lens.\" (The Wizard of Eyes: Evolution Creates Novelty by Varying the Same Old Tricks, Carol Kaesuk Yoon, November 2004, from the book: The Science Times Book of Fossils and Evolution, p175) \n\n \n \n and ...\n \n \n \n\"5.5 Orthologous proteins that have gained additional functions\n \n Gene sharing\n \n A special situation arises when a gene product is used to serve an additional function without losing its original function. This phenomenon, termed gene sharing, was discovered in the case of lens crystallins, which are used in the eye lens to maintain transparency (Tomarev & Piatigorsky 1996). Many types of crystallins were found to be identical with catalytically active enzymes, such as [alpha]-enolase ([one type of] crystallin), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ([pi]-crystallin), lactate dehydrogenase ([epsilon]-crystallin), aldehyde dehydrogenase ([another type of] crystallin), argininosuccinate lyase ([another type of] crystallin), and NADPH: quininone oxidoreductase ([another type of] crystallin).\" (Protein Evolution, Laszlo Patthy, Blackwell Science, 2000, p84) \n",

   "Dametel: I can understand why not teach alternatives to every science class out there. However, I do not believe there are that many alternative theories. Maybe ask questions and exemplify how they could be false could be just as satisfying. Also I do not think evolution has no weaknesses or as some people term it 'incomplete' I think that we should question these theories even if they might appear full proof. I know it sounds a bit choatic, but we always need to search for more than one answer.\n \n Also I thank you for the information about the sphere and more counter arguments to that of Behe. However, I saw that you quoted me about how creationism has been around longer and what not. I must clarify that I did not mean that Creationism has asked more questions, but evolution has. Creationist have just started to ask questions scientificaly. Here's what I said earlier...\n \n I think the same about the evolution theory. This theory however, has had the benifit of being around longer and asking more questions. So it has more evidence than other theories. You might say that since creationism is linked in ways to religious points of views it has been around much longer. However, people are just now trying to see if they can explain what \"God did it in less than a week\" in science terms. I say give this a chance, I don't say base every single time in education on it. I do say look at and try to accept some of the points and evidence it had brought to us. Than question the hell out of it! \n \n Also I do understand about what you are saying about Behe in the pages I mentionened. However, I am not a science major (Might be...) and do not understand everything you said. I do agree with you about how Behe did not say the eye was complex, however (I'm looking at the book right now) he does kind of hint to that the eye cannot merely be satisfied with an evolutionary explanation.\n \n To Iuris I do think that attacking a theory would make it stronger and make people ask more questions about it. Although I do beleive that creationism has some evidence to supports their findings, but I also agree with you that creationism might not hold up against the scrutiny that evolution has to deal with.\n \n And to Alan Ryan I think that would be an excellent idea. And to bring it up in science class about what does and does not constitute as a scientific understanding would also be excellent for it will open the door to questioning theries and not seeing them as entirely full proof.\n \n Also notice why this is the philosophy section. emoticon_xgood",

However, realise that these are points of detail, ie. just how did fossil reptile A relate to fossil reptile B- was it ancestral or an offshoot of an earlier ancestor? as opposed to questions such as is there any evidence to suggest these reptiles evolved at all?\n \n From what you say your view combines an overall religious belief while maintaining scientific integrity, which is a good thing. But be vary of real controvesy that exists in science and that which is created to subtley undermine the scientific approach in favour off inserting religion as a subsitute for invertigating that which we do not yet know.\n \n Which brings me to the point of \"teach the controversy\" one of the principle strategies used by modern creationism- which trys to undermine the findings of science just by basically say things like \"the contoverisal theory of evolution\" or \"evolution as yet remains unproven\".

   "However, I saw that you quoted me about how creationism has been around longer and what not. I must clarify that I did not mean that Creationism has asked more questions, but evolution has. \n\n \n Creationism is the Biblical account of creation. It had already been around for thousands of years before Darwin came up with his theory of evolution by means of natural selection.\n \n Are you using the unqualified term Creationism to mean something other than its default meaning?\n \n \nCreationist have just started to ask questions scientificaly.\n\n \n No, they do NOT ask scientific questions. Creationism is the BIBLICAL story of creation. It is a RELIGIOUS position. They pretend to be practicing science, but they aren't: they lie, distort, and tell half truths. \n \n That Creationism is a religious position - and not science - is not just my personal opinion: the federal courts have stated this fact.\n \n \n PS: Here are a couple of quotes from leading Creationists that show they are practicing religion, and not science.\n \n \n\"By creation we mean the bringing into being by a supernatural Creator of the basic kinds of plants and animals by the process of sudden, or fiat, creation. We do not know how the Creator created, what processes He used, for He used processes which are not now operating anywhere in the natural universe. This is why we refer to creation as special creation. We cannot discover by scientific investigation anything about the creative process used by the Creator.\"\n (italics in original, Duane Gish, Evolution? The Fossils Say No!, 1978, p42) \n\n \n \n \n\"Thus it is obvious that one can logically reject the historicity of Genesis I - II only if he likewise rejects the rest of the Bible as well, and even the infallibility of Christ himself. Many modern-day religious liberals and even some supposedly conservative Christians have done exactly that. Most Christians, however, are unwilling to go this far. Some try to avoid the issue altogether, but this tactic almost inevitably is a prelude to compromise.\n \n The only Bible-honoring conclusion is, of course, that Genesis I - II is the actual historical truth, regardless of any scientific or chronologic problems thereby entailed.\"\n (emphasis added, Henry M.

   "I hope DamEtel has shown you conclusively that Behe is not to be trusted when it comes to science, and that with his examples he has also proved to you that evolution does not have nearly as many 'holes' in it as is often claimed, and is in fact a very consistent and effective explanation.\n \n However, in the spirit of education, I thought I'd try to clear up some of the misconceptions you seem to have in an earlier post.\n \n \nWell, that is more of a personal understanding I have I admit. I'm supposed to believe the Big Bang began due to a large mixture of what would later become planets and other objects in space. The 'bang' happened and everything spread across the cosmos. However, I've always wondered what was before the Big Bang? What created all the debris? Also couldn't there be a more profound theory than the big bang out there? This is just my understanding from what I've read about the theory and would welcome someone who has studied it more intently. (BTW realized I don't think I answered your question that well, I see it as religious in how this debris or gasses that would later become are universe or that of many universes just exploded or was there. Its hard to explain how the debris has always been there without some focus on an immortal being.)\n\n \n 1) No one knows why the Big Bang happened. This is not a question for science, science can only tell us what happened.\n \n 2) The Big Bang was not an explosion of 'debris', in fact it was not an explosion at all in the conventional sense. The Big Bang was the sudden expansion of space and time themselves, the expanding space being filled with a vast amount of unimaginably hot particles and energy, which cooled as space expanded and eventually coalesced into matter, then dust clouds, which collapsed into galaxies. \n The most widely accepted theory of galaxy formation is that as the dust clouds collapsed on themselves under their own local gravity, the central mass of the dust cloud eventually became an enormous black hole, the formation of which created a shock wave which spread through the rest of the dust cloud, causing it to become \"lumpy\" ie not uniformly distributed. Each of these billions of \"lumps\" then contracted under gravity to form stars.\n \n 3) The idea that the Big Bang happened at all is in no way \"religious\" or based on faith, it is an inference that we have made as a result of observations that have been made: We have observed that all the galaxies we can see are heading away from one another (that is, every galaxy is moving away from every other galaxy due to the expansion of space itself, as well as their own motion), therefore we can extrapolate back and find that at some point all the matter in the universe was in one place. \n There may be a better explanation, as you suggest, but this is the only one that explains what we can see effectively (and there's a whole load of maths about which I have no understanding that backs this up).\n \n [/QUOTE]Just like how people believed that the earth was the center of the universe and that got disproved. Perhaps something else will get disproved? People also say that atoms are the most basic building blocks and than they find something thats smaller. (I unfortunately don't remember the exact name) All I ask is that everyone should question these and at the same time hold true to these theories and not entirely abandon them.\n I will admit I am no expert or a scientist and I welcome people to better explain these theories to me. However, I will alway see these theories as...just theories.[/QUOTE]\n \n 1) It is unlikely in this day and age that our most basics theories about the nature of the universe will be 'disproved' as such. The geocentric view was shown to be wrong by Galileo and Copernicus, two of the first practitioners of what we call the Scientific Method, using empirical evidence, experimentation and logic through maths to determine the most likely explanation for observed phenomena. Since we have now been using this method for centuries, what we now know is very accurate, and is likely to only be improved upon, made more accurate, rather than shown to be simply wrong.\n \n 2) It is very important that you don't place too much emphasis on the idea that scientific theories are \"just\" theories. To be accepted as theory, an idea has to have a large amount of experimental data that shows the theory to be very accurate and to be repeatably demonstrable over time, making accurate predictions again and again. These results are then examined by other scientists, and if they find them to be accurate and coherent, and can make their own predictions using it, then it gains acceptance as a theory.\n Before an idea reaches this stage, it is merely a hypothesis. This is the main difference between evolution, which is a theory, and ID which is a hypothesis.\n \n Still, it's good that you have an open mind, just remember that science is a very rigorous and self-regulating method, and as such most theories that are accepted by the large majority of scientists are not going to based on anybody's beliefs, they are based on observation and deduction.",

   "Meanwhile Nature is publishing this:\n \nGenetic evidence for complex speciation of humans and chimpanzees p1103\n Comparison of DNA sequence data from humans and chimpanzees, demonstrating that some regions show much higher divergence than other regions, indicates that the two species shared genetic material after the initial speciation event.\n Nick Patterson et al.\n 10.1038/nature04789\n The genetic divergence time between two species varies substantially across the genome, conveying important information about the timing and process of speciation. Here we develop a framework for studying this variation and apply it to about 20 million base pairs of aligned sequence from humans, chimpanzees, gorillas and more distantly related primates. Human-chimpanzee genetic divergence varies from less than 84% to more than 147% of the average, a range of more than 4 million years. Our analysis also shows that human-chimpanzee speciation occurred less than 6.3 million years ago and probably more recently, conflicting with some interpretations of ancient fossils. Most strikingly, chromosome X shows an extremely young genetic divergence time, close to the genome minimum along nearly its entire length. These unexpected features would be explained if the human and chimpanzee lineages initially diverged, then later exchanged genes before separating permanently.\n",

   "The genetic principles were described by Mendelev and Darwin had a copy of his work, but the book was never opened.\n Now in the light of Crick and Watson's discoveries this has been incorporated and this is known as Neo-Darwinism.\n Darwin described a process of gradual accumulated change now known as Gradualism. Study of the fosil record tends to show a punctuated equilibrium which suggests a mechanism known as Catastrophism.\n \n However Creationists believe that the the \"world\" (Universe) magicly popped into existance in November 4004 BC. That Sedimentary Rock (including Mount Everest) was deposited in 40 days (Flood). That the speed of Light slowed down to make the Universe appear larger and therefore older than it really is, the same with radioactive decay. And that essentially everything is some sort of massive conspiracy by God to make things look old.\n They also believe that no animal can change into another and certainly not apes into humans. Though this may be qualified by splitting things into \"micro-evolution\" and \"macro-evolution\". Also species may change into other species so long as they do not become a different \"biblical type\".\n \n Then there are Intelligent Design enthusiasts who belive that living things are too complex to have evolved naturally. This would be an intresting theory if they actually had a proven example. But it doesn't take too much digging to disprove any of their examples. eg. Bacterial Syringe.",
