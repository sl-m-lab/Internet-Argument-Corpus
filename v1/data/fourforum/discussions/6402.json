   "Hello,\n \n The Global Gag Rule (GGR), or technically Mexico City Policy is an interesting little bit of legislation that was cooked up by Ronald R. back in 1984 to prevent US Government aid supporting any non-governmental organisations associated with the provision of abortion services overseas. \n \n The critera by which this was applied was thus: support abortion in any way (this includes giving advice on third party abortion services) and your NGO will not receive any US aid. Other activities of NGO's were not considered, so a considerable number of charitable groups concerned with promoting sexual health and general family planning were hit by a cut in funding because part of their activities entailed offering abortion services/advice on such services.\n \n This legislation has turned out to be quite partisan as Clinton revoked it upon entering office in 1993, allowing financial aid to the NGO's previously denied US funding. Likewise Bush Junior reinstated the policy once more when he entered office in 2001.\n \n Unfortunately, the GGR is a bit like trying to swat a fly with a sledge hammer: have any activities associated with abortion and you do not get US funding, regardless of whatever other essential work you do. So in 2001 large numbers of NGO's working on family planning and sex education lost signifcant funding when Bush reinstated GGR.\n \n Pity it was the worlds poor who were benefiting for this US aid, and in countries where HIV/AIDS is prevalent the effect must be felt even more keenly. Organisations that promote safe sex have lost resources to carry out their vital work because they also offer advice on abortion/abortion services. There is an element of hypocrisy here as Bush has spent much time extoling how his administration wants to help Africa with its HIV problem, yet is quite willing to deny funding to NGO's who do very important work in that area.\n \n Oh well, 3 more years and there might be a Democrat on Capitol Hill again who can revoke the policy once again......",

The \"free love\" of the 70's gave way to the social conservativism of the new millenium. I have no doubt that there will be successful efforts to protect the unborn in this country in the not-too-distant future.\n \n\n Finally on the topic of Christianity, I thought there was supposed to be a strong separation of Church and State in the US? perhaps that is a principle that the advocates of the GGR decided they could ignore.\n\n And perhaps our unwillingness to fund murder transcends the boundaries of Church and State and goes directly to our morality, regardless of its basis?
