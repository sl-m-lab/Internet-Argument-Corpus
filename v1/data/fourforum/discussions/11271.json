The fact that you tried to argue that nobody argued my position is evidence that I was right: it was so futile that not only did it have no effect on policy/actions, you didn't even remember that it happened. But you jumped all over me because you mistakenly thought that I'm just one of the sheeple who didn't speak out at first.\n \n \nI'm saying it's a futile effort to try to impeach Bush NOW.\n\n And I said the same thing in my first post in this thread. This is not being argued.\n \n \nThose are two different issues.\n\n Agreed, but your double standard remains unresolved. You essentially want me to shut up and move on because I can't do anything about trying Bush and his cronies, but you yell at me for (allegedly) shutting up and moving on when I couldn't do anything about the war and the eroding of our freedoms.\n I'll boil this down: You have said what amounts to, \"You should have spoken up about A even though it was futile, but you shouldn't speak up about B because it is futile.\" Why does it matter that B is not A? Can you show why your reasoning applies to one but not the other?",

For some unfortunately reason, some people seem very eager to replace our arena of discourse and dialog for a courtroom of criminal indictment, when there are other views out there, and that's just not right. We just don't try people with this type of 'evidence', and if this is really nothing more than a rhetorical tactic, then it's basically a form of dishonesty.

These are all complicated issues and frankly, just taking a 'lock-'em-up' approach is a cop out--and a rather scary one at that.

Most people are more reasonable than this, thank goodness, and know that evidence over things like this is often political and from one side of given issues.
