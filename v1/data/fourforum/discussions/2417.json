It's a shame that most good anime is never released in the US, or dumbed down so much so as not to **** off the FCC that the story is ruined.\n\n \n Thank you.\n Every anime series would be good but the censorship people have to edit every one. Then the story gets confusing and makes no sense some times. \n Moving on i think the the best sreies has to be \"FLCL\" for those who don't watch anime it stands for \"fooly cooly\" o in japanese \"furi curi\" it needs to be a longer series it is only about a week long series. \n Naota and Haruko are the best characters in that series.\n \n Does anybody agree with me",
