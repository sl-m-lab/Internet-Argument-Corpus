Since 9/11 they have faced discrimination of various levels. Thus, it is only natural that they may take these cartoons extremely seriously. These cartoons strike them at their core.\n \n Today (09 - 02- 2006), I read that yet another European newspaper has published the cartoons, despite knowing that they have sparked protests all over the world, some being violent. This is like throwing fuel on the already blazing flames of anger. Can this be viewed as an attempt to disregard the views of the protesters?\n In History, we find that the end of the Inca civilization resulted when Atualpa, the Inca emperor, threw the Bible on the floor. Pizarro and his men considered this to be a great insult and destroyed the entire race of people. To the Incas, the book was just a trivial piece of literature but to the Europeans it was the core of their faith - all their beliefs revolved around what was written there.\n \n To acknowledge that the cartoons have hurt Muslims all over the world unnecessarily and simply apologize for the pain caused by them is no difficult task.

HAHAHAHAHA!!!\n \n Long live free speech.\n \n This has to be one of the stupidest exhibitions of their cultural beliefs I have ever witnessed. \n \n I would like to see some Jesus cartoons too. I wanna see Pat Robertson get a bug up his butt too.\n \n I mean, how strong can a religion be if some yahoo cartoonist can disrupt it and cause world havoc with a stupid cartoon that isn't even funny to begin with? Sticks and stones anyone?\n \n They are so mad they're killing each other!! emoticon_xkill \n \n Just think, if we had known how'd they react to a few goofy cartoons, we might have been able to save over 2000 American soldiers. We could have just made up a bunch of cartoon fliers and dropped them over Baghdad and let them all go at it.emoticon_cry \n \n We'll show you! Crash jet planes into our buildings again and we will bomb you with cartoons about Mohammad! That will teach you! <sarcasm<\n \n It's deeper than the cartoon. It's the indifference we have towards the cartoons and the insensitivity we have towards the Islamic objection to them. Much like their overall indifference to the terrorists who maim and kill people worldwide in the name of Allah. Anyone remember the dancing Muslims on the bridge trussle beneath the scorched body of that dead American?\n \n Anybody remember the Muslims burning effigies of our leaders and our flag?\n \n And I'm supposed to get upset over some stupid cartoon? I think not.\n \n Ain't payback a *****?\n \n The last protester standing, would you please turn off the light?",

   "Lots of Jews eat pork and have no qualms about so doing. \n \n I also suspect that quite a number of Muslims are representational artists as well, and eat pork and enjoy alcohol.\n\n Hmm, I'd disagree here - whilst there are a lot of reasonably relaxed muslims (I certainly know some who drink alcohol), they are less likely to be the ones making religious images. Seems an odd combination unless, like the cartoonists they are making a statement about how religion needs to change to fit modern times.\n \n Friend1 - yes, it was sarcastic (sort of, anway. I don't think sarcastic is quite the word, but you get the point.)\n \n Not sure where I stand on this, certainly don't agree with the rioting and suchlike, but I really don't agree with the papers just trying to cash in irresponsibly by printing the things again. Freedom of speach/press I don't see as one of those sacrosanct rights a lot of people (probably journalists) seem to hold it as, yeah if you have none its bad but too much can be just as bad.",

   "In Islam it is not allowed to protray the Prophet in any form. I remember even seeing a movie on the Prophet's life where the prophet was not even protrayed by an actor. Thus by portraying the prophet in a cartoon, wheter good or bad, the beliefs of the people were violated. In addition, the cartoons can be considered to be insulting by many Muslims- their views and beliefs are different from others. \n \n I also learnt the the Government of Denmark refuses to comment on the issue citing Freedon of Speech. From my understanding, no one human right has preference over another and the right to practise one's religion free from contempt is a Human Right. While Freedon os Speech is indeed important and should be allowed, it must be remembered that Freedon of Speech does not mean freedom from being responsible.\n\n \n I found this article interesting:\n http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110007934",

   "There is no PROOF of \"God or Allah\" therefore how can a man be the last prophet to mankind from \"God\"? Are you telling me \"God/Allah\" is a sexist discriminating pig that only believe MEN can spread the message of \"God\". Gimme a break. \n \n I'm not a religious NUT, and no MAN is a prophet as far as I'm concerned, and if I want to draw a painting of the Muhammad like a Picasso, then I will. What's next with religion, will I be forbidden to draw a picture of demons for fear of bad luck.\n \n PROVE TO ME THERE IS A GOD. Be secure in your religion as I am in mine. I'm tired of all the religious faith trying to prove their faith is more supreme. \n \n I am solid in my \"beliefs\". My beliefs have no absurd LAWS dictating to others how to live and not to live. That's not GOD that's a religious male leader! \n \n Why is it only HUMANS have \"gods\", thank god, cows, horses, pigs, dogs and cats don't have their version of \"gods\" that would be a holy mess. \n \n You see when natural disasters hit its not an act of god. When countries rape and kill their own citizens, that is not the act of their god. When countries abuse the environment and the earth is becoming damaged, that's not an act of their god. When the dinosaurs were wiped out, that wasn't an act of their god. Believe what you all want, believe a cartoon of a MAN with a turban with a bomb is \"insulting\", to YOUR god, but what is really insulting is that you think I have to obey the laws of YOUR god, your prophets and your messengers.\n \n Well, let me tell you about MY RELIGION. \"No man or woman will make claim to being a prophet, or messenger, from a greater being, to do so would mock the intelligence of human kind. Where the fate of humans, and all living matter on earth is in the hands of humans\" \n \n Now, am I not entitled to call out the con-men of other faiths with \"gods\" and \"prophets\", or must my religion cower to yours?",
