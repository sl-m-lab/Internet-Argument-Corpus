   "Somewhere amongst that verbage you reveal a tiny glimmer of sense.\n \n We dont know the exact doctrine of Christianity.. some accept the bible to be the authoritative canon of the life and teachings of Christ.\n Some other texts were discarded and some were considered heresy.\n There is a true Christianity but no one knows what it is.\n Just because the original word MAY not be in existence, that does not mean that it never was.\n The Bible contains enough to be a guide for living and hope for a life after death.\n It does not( when taking the new covenant into consideration) promote selfish,childish and needy behaviour , people are needy childish and selfish anyway....even athiests.\n\n \n I can agree with this. The Bible is not necessary for poor behavior nor is it the source.",
