This is not what one would expect if the evolutionary story about human origins is true, HH should be more bipedal than the Lucy type skeleton from which it supposedly evolved from, but it is not. In fact, most scientists now think that HH is not one creature, but instead is several types of creatures that do not belong together, at least three or more different animals, hence making it an invalid category. Further more, it cannot be our ancestor as no such animal ever existed.\n \n Hence, the evidence is interpreted more sensibly and reasonable through a creationary model.

   "To pandion:\n \n \nAny similarity to the Natural History Museum in London is imaginary. None of the displays in London are based on mythology.\n\n \n You have to think in context to what this is. The world before Adam's Fall and after is very important to the Christian doctrine as it sets many rules (e.g. marriage) and answers many questions (e.g. why death and suffering). It tells us that we all fall short of God's glory and need His Son to take away our sins. They are just showing what it may have been like.\n \n Creation is based on the belief that the Bible is God's Word and as a result, that it is truth. This is a reasonable and rational assumption. Atheistic evolutionism is based on the belief that there is no God and as such, the Bible is wrong. Therefore, everything must be explained by natural processes. If you continue to ignore this fundamental point, than it is pointless talking to you. \n \n They will be displaying the same scientific evidence and then be pointing out aspects of that evidence that points to creation being true as opposed to evolutionism, see example above in my previous post for a good example of this. What is the Natural History Museum in London? It is a place where they discuss our origins from an evolutionary point of view. What will the Creation Museum be? It is a place where they will discuss our origins from a creationary point of view. They are both museums for discussing what may have happened in the past based on two different underlying assumptions. No, there is no similarities, is there? Ignorance. The only difference between them is the underlying assumptions, or belief systems. \n \n Creation - based on a literal read of the Bible.\n Atheistic evolution - based on the religous belief of atheism.\n \n Because creation is based on the Bible, it will obviously talk about the Garden of Eden, the Fall, the Flood, the seperation of the people and confusion of their languages at Babel and may be the Good News of Jesus Christ - who knows?\n \n The only reason why the museum at London does not talk about the Flood, etc., is because of it's atheistic interpretation of the evidence and not acknowledging the Bible as the Written Word of God.",

   "Hi sinjin:\n \n \nNo, the reason is that there is no objective evidence that any of these things actually existed or happened.\n\n \n Thus you show your ignorance of the evidence and what I have been saying for a long time. I would not usually use capitals, but just for you to see the main ideas, I will use them for you. BOTH creationists AND evolutionists have the SAME scientific evidence. The only reason why they come to different conclusions about it's [the evidence's] origin is because the have different INTERPRETATIONS about the evidence that is BASED on their STARTING FAITHS of UNDERLYING BELIEFS, i.e. atheism or Christianity. This is not a hard concept to understand! \n \n To an atheist, the evolutionary view is true because it matches with his/her starting assumptions or underlying beliefs. A belief in God and the subsquent creation model is considered by these people to be lies and false as it goes against his/her underlying beliefs (i.e. there is no God). The opposite is for creationists. They consider a belief in evolution to be false as it goes against their underlying beliefs (i.e. the truth of the Bible). All of their science goes from this underlying belief.\n \n You have deomonstrated this idea clearly in your post. You claim that there is no evidence or no objective evidence for a global flood, this is from your atheistic evolutionary point-of-view (easier said than done). If you are going to make such claims, you should take off your evolutionary world view glasses and put on the creationary world view glasses. When you look at the same evidence through different world views, you will be surprised at the conclusion you will come up with. Many creation scientists (who have changed from evolution to creation) say that when they were evolutionists they saw no evidence for creation. But when they became Christians and creationists, they saw plently evidence for creation - which really emphasises the point that what conclusion we will arrive at after looking at the evidence depends on what world view you have (i.e. your starting assumptions/faiths). \n \n What an evolutionist describes as taking long periods of time to produce, such as the Grand Canyon, a creationist would state that the Grand Canyon only took a short time to be produced by using DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS (i.e. the Flood) to those ASSUMPTIONS used by the evolutionist (i.e. slow and steady - the present is the key to the past). They are both equally valid as science cannot state which one is right, because science cannot deal with the past. BOTH creationists and evolutionists look at the Grand Canyon and ask themselves, \"What can we see from this evidence that supports our theory?\"\n \n These links provide substantial evidence for Noah's Flood:\n * Flood Q&A \n * Geology Q&A \n \n \nMost atheists are former believers whose faith did not survive rational thought.\n\n \n I wouldn't say that. As has been explained before in the \"Creation is irrational\" thread or something like that, a belief in creation and God is more rational than a belief in naturalistic processes without a God. I would advise you to read a few posts from there. The main reason why these \"former believer's\" faith did not survive is not from the belief being unrational, but most likely from many unanswered questions, such as \"Why is there death and suffering in the world?\" Genuine searchers would have found that the Bible answers these and other questions easily!\n Have a great day,\n Nu Leader.",

The Pope has condemned it as an absolute evil, and would have it banned. Kerry has made his choice to a secular cause over a theistic one; as is his right under US law. Kerry still believes in abortion per se, just not for him. I never said he believes abortion should be promoted through schools across America or anything like that, but his non-opposition to it on a general scale means he believes in abortion. You yourself have said he won't fight against it, why? Because he is pro-choice; which is saying he believes that people have the right to have an abortion. He believes in abortion. It may not be 'for him', but he still believes in abortion for other people.\n \nKerry was raised an American and educated as an American, including his legal training that included as study of constitutional law. Therefore he can personally and morally oppose abortion and at the same time recognize the legal right of a woman to decide her own fate - within limits.\n\n He can indeed choose a secularist path of compromise. It is his right. Does this make it a Catholic stance? No. His choice is to follow the law of the nation over a moral of the church, THEREFORE he can state that he is Catholic, but disagrees with a major issue of the Catholic church; the sanctity of human life.\n \nTo claim that Kerry \"believes\" in abortion is either an ignorant statement or a malicious lie. How many times does he have to make statements declaring his opposition to abortion before the brain dead get the picture?\n\n Aside from your compulsion to ad hominem, to make a statement that he supports women's rights to chose is a cop-out attempt to appeal to the 'liberal' and 'conservatives' It's almost as hollow as me saying I believe you have a right to have babies, if you can't have babies.\n \nBy the way, I am strongly opposed to abortion for almost every reason (there are some exceptions about which I am ambivalent).

It seems that you are willing to slander and misrepresent those who disagree with you.

The Pope has made it clear that it is an absolute evil. It's the same (in terms of the stance of the Catholic Church) as him saying \"I don't believe in shooting children, but I will fight for your right to shoot and kill your own kids\" (and that's what abortion is to the Catholic Church, to my church and many others; the killing of children). In fact the Catholic church lobbies politicians to change the laws. They don't want politicians just saying \"It's a matter of personal choice\" in case you haven't realised, the Catholic Church is not 'pro-choice' (and by the way pro-choice doesn't imply everyone's going to have an abortion for sure; but for the right to have an abortion, so pro-choice are pro-abortion). There's a difference. He believes in abortion as an absolute right for people. He has chosen not to, but it is correct to say that he still believes in abortion.",

   "What do other religions say about the creation the universe. I only know the judeo-christian model. What are the others (in short)\n\n \n I can only comment on Hindu creation because that is the only one im studying currently.\n \n There are two aspects to creation. First is the creation of the physical universe, the second is the creation of life.\n \n The physical universe came into being because a higher being created it. The creation was the result of this higher being experimenting with its own life, much as a newborn child does. The creation of this higher being is sketchy, but it involves the higher being first realizing its own existance (i have more to research). The first things it created were other higher beings(replication). After creating the beings, it then comtemplated upon its own death, and realized that its death would not result in the destruction of its creations. So, finally, after a while, it died.\n \n One of the higher beings it created was called Bhraman(?). This God then \"exploded\" its soul (big bang, anyone? except developed several thousand years ago) and created the known universe. In addition to the known universe, this explosion also created Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva.\n \n Brahma installs life (read: soul) into a physical body. Vishnu looks after the body through its journey in life, and Shiva recycles the soul after the body is unable to sustain itself (reincarnation).\n \n Also, Hindu philosophy accepts evolution as the way the physical embodiments of life came into existence. God merely created the universe, he did not create every single thing inside of it.\n \n So thats creation in a nutshell.\n \n Trying to explain this has now made me want to re-learn the process. I think ill do that now.\n \n This has also made me curious as to what Islamic creation says. I think ill look that up too, in addition to scientology.\n \n Oh, and check out my signature. The quote reflects the thinking of Hindu philosophers. The quote is from the Rig Veda, which is one of the most religious texts in Hinduism.",

I first heard that your ancestors told of a catastrophic flood that covered everything from AiG through one of their documentaries called \"Raging Waters\". Appearently there are many other indigenous groups from around the whole world that tell of a catastrophic flood! If we just think about this for a moment, for indigenous groups and many religions to be telling the same thing about a flood, that implies that they all must have been descendents of those who survived the global flood. You know, the survivors tell their children and they tell their children, and so on, for many generations. The tower of Babel can be incorporated into this as the reason why the one human race split up and moved away from each other. The Aboriginals ended up living in Australia, while others lived in America and so forth. They both tell the story of the flood. I think that for so many groups who may not even have known that other groups existed in different countries to have the a story of the flood is incredible! To me, this is strong proof that the land of Australia and the world was once covered by raging waters. Also, the theory of evolution denies all other religions on the world too...",

It was a grand Victorian design as well, and it also bears this influence quite clearly.\n\n \n When I was in London I preferred the National Portrait Gallery over all others, but I prefer history to naturalism and pre-history (though I did Pre-history at university).",
