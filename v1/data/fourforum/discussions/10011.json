The man DID mentally exist, just as most human beings do. If he didn't, he'd be dead.\n \n An example of something without a mental existence would be a human corpse.

You tried to apply \"brain death\" to a developing fetus that does not have a brain.\n\n \n Not exactly. The early developing fetus does not have a brain. Given that it will NOT have self-awareness nor consciousness. Absent a brain (and brain activity) its logical NOT to accord it the status of a person at that time. Anymore than it is to declare a sperm a person because it has the \"potential\" of generating a human being.\n \n \nThis is incredible.

This term does not refer to phenomenon you are describing.\n\n \n Tis not incredible. Its a view widely shared by many logical and moral individuals in the society you live in. A brainless set of tissues is not a person and need not be accorded that status. To do so is illogical and runs against biological realities.\n \n \n2. You said that \"Life does not begin at conception, it never ceased to exist.\" This is false. Science tells us that a new unique life begins at conception. \n \n\n \n Life is continuous and ongoing. New life is not created at any point in the reproductive process.

You must be referring to the existence of something that is outside of the realm of atoms and natural matter - maybe of a spiritual nature? \n \n\n \n There is no dividing line for life.

   "Not exactly. The early developing fetus does not have a brain. Given that it will NOT have self-awareness nor consciousness. Absent a brain (and brain activity) its logical NOT to accord it the status of a person at that time. Anymore than it is to declare a sperm a person because it has the \"potential\" of generating a human being.\n \n\n \n You have implied this before in another debate but refused to clarify what you meant by it because it makes no sense at all. At what point of the growth process does an unborn child miraculously grow a brain chemist ? How can you say that the brain as the largest human organ isn't steadily growing at the same rate of growth that all the other parts of the child is growing at ? If a 12 week old fetus has fingers, toes and a nose, are you saying that his brain has not yet started growing yet at all ? And that the inside of his skull is empty ? A more ridiculous assertion is difficult to even consider. \n \n In fact, because the fetus is alive and according to actual observations moves around within the womb, I believe that though the brain is in proportion to the skull in size that it has electrical activity taking place just like a brain of a persons living outside the womb does. And you know that old adage chemists love to bandy about, \"If the synapse are firing then the brain is thinking\". Synapse being the result of chemical/electrical reaction and all.\n \n Also, as a scientist, doesn't it seem obvious to you that if the fetus is growing then there must be electrical activity stimulating the growth of the body ? And why is an ignorant christian who is constantly accused of being anti science asking an intellectual such as yourself such obvious questions ? Why aren't these facts obvious to you ? It seems that anyone with an understanding of science would have to appreciate the fact that if there wasn't original life in the unborn baby then it couldn't grow and most importantly, that the brain grows with and in proportion to the body so it is constantly growing from inception to full term delivery. \n \n To support my assertions, here's some additional info that is pretty hard to refute. With a link too of course.\n \n Armed with highly sensitive and sophisticated monitoring gear, DiPietro and other researchers today are discovering that the real action starts weeks earlier. At 32 weeks of gestation--two months before a baby is considered fully prepared for the world, or \"at term\" --a fetus is behaving almost exactly as a newborn. And it continues to do so for the next 12 weeks. And please note the bolded.\n \n http://health.yahoo.com/topic/parenting/behavior/article/pt/Psychology_Today_articles_pto-19980901-000026\n \n As if overturning the common conception of infancy weren't enough, scientists are creating a startling new picture of intelligent life in the womb. Among the revelations:\n \n o By nine weeks, a developing fetus can hiccup and react to loud noises. By the end of the second trimester it can hear.\n \n o Just as adults do, the fetus experiences the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep of dreams.\n \n o The fetus savors its mother's meals, first picking up the food tastes of a culture in the womb.\n \n o Among other mental feats, the fetus can distinguish between the voice of Mom and that of a stranger, and respond to a familiar story read to it.\n \n o Even a premature baby is aware, feels, responds, and adapts to its environment.\n \n o Just because the fetus is responsive to certain stimuli doesn't mean that it should be the target of efforts to enhance development. Sensory stimulation of the fetus can in fact lead to bizarre patterns of adaptation later on.\n \n The roots of human behavior, researchers now know, begin to develop early--just weeks after conception, in fact. Well before a woman typically knows she is pregnant, her embryo's brain has already begun to bulge. By five weeks, the organ that looks like a lumpy inchworm has already embarked on the most spectacular feat of human development: the creation of the deeply creased and convoluted cerebral cortex, the part of the brain that will eventually allow the growing person to move, think, speak, plan, and create in a human way.\n \n At nine weeks, the embryo's ballooning brain allows it to bend its body, hiccup, and react to loud sounds. At week ten, it moves its arms, \"breathes\" amniotic fluid in and out, opens its jaw, and stretches. Before the first trimester is over, it yawns, sucks, :and swallows as well as feels and smells. By the end of the second trimester, it can hear; toward the end of pregnancy, it can see.",

   "Yes. That is the choice.\n\n \n At least you are honest about this.\n \n \nAnd for some women the choice to \"deliberately causing\" her zef's death is the right one. She refuses permission for another human to use her body and therefore to terminate the pregnancy means to cause the death of the zef.\n \n You are allowed not to agree with that choice. But you have no right to impose your moral objection onto others.\n\n \n First of all, I don't know what a zef is. Perhaps you could enlighten me so that I know what you are saying.\n \n Second of all, she most certainly may think that causing another human being's death is the right choice to make.

Their moral acceptance of abortion is equal to your moral objection.\n\n \n My moral objection to abortion and her moral acceptance of abortion does not mean that we are both right any more than my moral objection to murder and Ted Bundy's acceptance of it means that both of us are right.\n \n \nOf course it does. Because it isn't living inside THE BODY OF ANOTHER PERSON. A baby does not physically require itself to be attached to another human being in order to continue living. It just needs care and attention which it can get from family members, grandparents, nurses, care workers, social workers etc. There is a substitute for parenting. There is no substitute for a uterus.\n\n \n I am unwilling to discriminate against another human being based solely on its location. You are perfectly free to do so.

She is not choosing to kill a nothing. She is choosing to kill a human being. For you it appears to be a matter of rights conflict, which is where I suppose most pro-choice people simply give the mother the benefit of that conflict.

Its a bit of tissue which may given no intervention BECOME a human being with some luck. But its NOT a human being.\n \n Why not (to the second underlined set). You also get to exercise your choice under the current arrangeents. Nobody forces an abortion on you nor should you force a birth upon someone else. Society cannot and will likely never reach a fully accepted or acceptable policy in this instance. When that happens it becomes a matter of individual values and individual choice. NOT a matter of enforcing your own specific point of view. I'm not after all advocating making abortions compulsory, but you ARE advocating making carryiing a fetus to birth mandatory.

   "No comment huh chemist ? I thought not.\n \n \n\n Not exactly. The early developing fetus does not have a brain. Given that it will NOT have self-awareness nor consciousness. Absent a brain (and brain activity) its logical NOT to accord it the status of a person at that time. Anymore than it is to declare a sperm a person because it has the \"potential\" of generating a human being.\n\n \n You have implied this before in another debate but refused to clarify what you meant by it because it makes no sense at all. At what point of the growth process does an unborn child miraculously grow a brain chemist ? How can you say that the brain as the largest human organ isn't steadily growing at the same rate of growth that all the other parts of the child is growing at ? If a 12 week old fetus has fingers, toes and a nose, are you saying that his brain has not yet started growing yet at all ? And that the inside of his skull is empty ? A more ridiculous assertion is difficult to even consider. \n \n In fact, because the fetus is alive and according to actual observations moves around within the womb, I believe that though the brain is in proportion to the skull in size that it has electrical activity taking place just like a brain of a persons living outside the womb does. And you know that old adage chemists love to bandy about, \"If the synapse are firing then the brain is thinking\". Synapse being the result of chemical/electrical reaction and all.\n \n Also, as a scientist, doesn't it seem obvious to you that if the fetus is growing then there must be electrical activity stimulating the growth of the body ? And why is an ignorant christian who is constantly accused of being anti science asking an intellectual such as yourself such obvious questions ? Why aren't these facts obvious to you ? It seems that anyone with an understanding of science would have to appreciate the fact that if there wasn't original life in the unborn baby then it couldn't grow and most importantly, that the brain grows with and in proportion to the body so it is constantly growing from inception to full term delivery. \n \n To support my assertions, here's some additional info that is pretty hard to refute. With a link too of course.\n \n Armed with highly sensitive and sophisticated monitoring gear, DiPietro and other researchers today are discovering that the real action starts weeks earlier. At 32 weeks of gestation--two months before a baby is considered fully prepared for the world, or \"at term\" --a fetus is behaving almost exactly as a newborn. And it continues to do so for the next 12 weeks. And please note the bolded.\n \n http://health.yahoo.com/topic/parenting/behavior/article/pt/Psychology_Today_articles_pto-19980901-000026\n \n As if overturning the common conception of infancy weren't enough, scientists are creating a startling new picture of intelligent life in the womb. Among the revelations:\n \n o By nine weeks, a developing fetus can hiccup and react to loud noises. By the end of the second trimester it can hear.\n \n o Just as adults do, the fetus experiences the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep of dreams.\n \n o The fetus savors its mother's meals, first picking up the food tastes of a culture in the womb.\n \n o Among other mental feats, the fetus can distinguish between the voice of Mom and that of a stranger, and respond to a familiar story read to it.\n \n o Even a premature baby is aware, feels, responds, and adapts to its environment.\n \n o Just because the fetus is responsive to certain stimuli doesn't mean that it should be the target of efforts to enhance development. Sensory stimulation of the fetus can in fact lead to bizarre patterns of adaptation later on.\n \n The roots of human behavior, researchers now know, begin to develop early--just weeks after conception, in fact. Well before a woman typically knows she is pregnant, her embryo's brain has already begun to bulge. By five weeks, the organ that looks like a lumpy inchworm has already embarked on the most spectacular feat of human development: the creation of the deeply creased and convoluted cerebral cortex, the part of the brain that will eventually allow the growing person to move, think, speak, plan, and create in a human way.\n \n At nine weeks, the embryo's ballooning brain allows it to bend its body, hiccup, and react to loud sounds. At week ten, it moves its arms, \"breathes\" amniotic fluid in and out, opens its jaw, and stretches. Before the first trimester is over, it yawns, sucks, :and swallows as well as feels and smells. By the end of the second trimester, it can hear; toward the end of pregnancy, it can see.",

I've asked this before already.

Europeans don't vote on abortion as a single, particular issue, but that doesn't invalidate the issue of abortion within each political system.\n\n \n I did gather you weren't from the US (which is not bad, of course). Where are you from (if you don't mind)? You obviously don't need to say though.\n \n The policy of abortion in the United States has been established judicially. That policy essentially gives the woman a right to abortion for any reason. Hence my insistence on the woman aborting for gender purposes. That can, and does, happen in the United States. All I argue on these forums is that the policy in the United States needs to change.\n \n \nSo women are mass aborting girl babies in the US? emoticon_xdonno I'd appreciate some unbiased sources for that. My understanding of the birth rate in the US was that there is very little difference between baby boys and girls ... but I could be wrong.\n\n \n My point is not that it is happening; my point is that it can happen under current policy.\n \n \n \nThe basis is that a woman is a born, sentient, thinking, talking, walking, breathing person. And for the record, a fetus doesn't just \"live in the womb\". It lives in a womb belonging to a woman. Stop degrading the woman involved and stripping her of her integrity, thought, opinion and decision-making.\n\n \n The fetus lives exactly where it is supposed to live. That simply is the fact of the matter. That says nothing degrading about women. I simply don't understand where this natural right to kill your children came from. Where did this right come from, Maz?",

   "One has to suppose you would given that you are opposed to all abortions regardless of the motivation and consider them equivalent to first degree murder. The genetic makeup of the fetus is not the issue. The issue is and remains that a fetus is not a person unless its accorded that state by the choice of the woman carrying it.\n\n \n Another philosophical judgment.\n \n \nLets take an example, a totally awful psycopath breaks into a couples bedroom and kills the husband in front of the wifes eyes. He then kills the couples three children in front of the wife to futher terrorize her. He then proceeds to rape the wife and she happens to become pregnant with his child. The rapist is caught and soon find to have a several disabling but not fatal genetic diseases. Tests on the fetus show the fetus carries every darn one of them.\n \n If the woman has an abortion are you really going to charge her with first degree murder and slap her in prison for life?\n \n Are you really going to force her to carry this diseased fetus which is a mixture of her perfectly normal genes and those of a genetically diseased psycho and if necessary strap her down to make sure she does not harm the fetus she has good reason to hate and wish not to give birth to. Would you really go so far as to deny justice to a human being (the wpoman) so that this such a non person as lump of tissue that is the fetus (lets say its the first trimester) will be brought into the world?\n\n \n Have I said that? No I have not. I happen to think that abortion policy prior to Roe v. Wade was the right policy.",

   "I would allow the abortion and strive to ensure that the circumstances within society that lead women to abort on grounds of gender, are eradicated. The only reason I can imagine why women would want to terminate a baby purely because its a girl, would be because girls are looked down upon and considered second class citizens. \n \n If that is the case, then it is the misogyny of that society you should be challenging, not the abortion.\n\n \n Well, as I've said, it can also happen in the United States, a society that can hardly be considered misogynistic. Abortion on the basis of gender selection ought not be allowed in a society such as the United States should it? One that does not have a problem with misogyny.\n \n Here is an article discussing the legal reality of gender based abortion in the United States: http://writ.news.findlaw.com/colb/20050126.html. This is just to show that I am not of base in stating that it is possible under current policy to have such abortions.
