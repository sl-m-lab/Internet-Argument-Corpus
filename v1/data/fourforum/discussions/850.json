So it is apparent why we haven't moved against them yet. We are hoping they are bluffing and don't wish to risk war if this is just a bluff. But, if they continuing making nukes and eventually have maybe 8 or 9 and still are demanding more from the US then what do we do? The unpredictable future of this situation may lead us into a much more dangerous situation than the Iraq situation could possibly have.

I hope Kim knows the US is committed to defending South Korea. However, how willing would the US be to go to war against North Korea alone? I think the UN including China would have to support this type of war if the South was invaded. We have already shown that we're not willing to accept very large losses in our recent wars and a war with North Korea would be bad in those terms.

The fear of how bad the war in Iraq would be shows how hyped up people can get about the power of one nation. The actual war showed really how powerful the military force of essentially just one country fighting on foreign grounds can be.\n\n \n More Americans have died AFTER the war was declared over than before, and many of them killed before the end were from friendly fire.\n \n \nIf the Crusade v Jihad rivalry was to start up again it would only last a short period of time before technology crumbled the whole of the muslim world and all that would be left were unorganized terrorists.\n\n \n The USA depends on Technology, they don't have to.\n \n \nTerrorist simply cannot take control of anything as large as a country because they create too much hate from the people of the countries they attack.\n\n \n And the same can be said of the USA as well. The Iraqi people want you gone, NOW.\n \n \nIsrael would never accept the leadership of an Arafat just because terrorist attacks keep happening.\n\n \n They wouldn't accewpt it even if there weren't any terrorist attacks. They have the PROMISED LAND and they weren't going to give it back.\n \n \nIf push came to shove for a nation being almost completely overwhelmed by terrorists I think they themselves would become even worse terrorists, perhaps similar to Hitler only on foreign grounds and begin killing anyone they think could be involved meaning all muslims. Eventually it would all end with the Christians winning even if it is not using the nicest of methods. Technology would provide victory over time and the muslims would suffer for years before their final downfall.\n\n \n No one wins in that kind of situation.",

   "More Americans have died AFTER the war was declared over than before, and many of them killed before the end were from friendly fire.\n\n \n At this rate we may lose 1/500th as many people as we did in Vietnam. Our initial invasion was so successful in Iraq that the after effects look devastating when compared to it. We had a great plan of attack but didn't even have a decent plan of what to do after we won the war.\n \n But your response really doesn't address the problem. If the muslims continue their \"Jihads\" against nations there will be more wars waged against them. As seen with how Iraq and Afghanistan fell, how many more Jihads can the muslim world even handle before they have no home left?\n \n \nThe USA depends on Technology, they don't have to.\n\n \n But as shown by the fall of the Taliban and the resulting lack of retaliations against the US for this invasion, the terrorists do depend on having some sort of organized effort in order to succeed and we are able to take that from them. They will no doubt be able to launch some terrorist attacks in the future but they have lost a lot of their capabilities because of how we have broken them up and are still hunting them down.\n \n \nAnd the same can be said of the USA as well. The Iraqi people want you gone, NOW.\n\n \n The polls I've seen don't seem to mirror this. The Iraqi people want control of their own country but they don't want the US gone NOW. The country would fall into chaos with no legitimate policing force and no organized government. Leaving now would be devastating to the Iraqis.\n \n \nThey wouldn't accewpt it even if there weren't any terrorist attacks. They have the PROMISED LAND and they weren't going to give it back.\n\n \n The Israelis could have far more than that. They could have Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon as well. Israel was able to defeat the Middle East powers alone and after being surprise attacked in 1973 using technology that the muslim nations simply didn't possess. If not for Russia the majority of the muslim nations in the Middle East would already be under the control of Israel. Technology has it's perks.\n \n \nNo one wins in that kind of situation.\n\n \n No one does but if there would have to be a winner chosen it surely would not be the muslims. If the muslims ever really became a threat and their terrorist attacks became far more deadly than we could handle, I don't forsee the muslim powers lasting very long.",

The reason why we aren't hearing much about it is that the USA has lost interest. They've even taken Bin Ladin from being their primary target now. It is easier to search for you keys under the street light than where you lost them around the car.\n \n \nThey will no doubt be able to launch some terrorist attacks in the future but they have lost a lot of their capabilities because of how we have broken them up and are still hunting them down.\n\n \n They don't really have to do much for any lengtg of time. All they have to do is let you destroy yourselves. I.E. Patriot Acts, Homeland \"security\", etc. They have patience.
