The computer interface is somethign that I have on my wish list, but I am not sure I use the telescope anough for it to be worthwhile. I mostly use it as a planetery scope. The motor dirve is noce in that it allows you to (manually) track objects without the jitter associated with manual adjustment. \n \n Does his use a propreitary control system, or does it just connect to a regular computer? I have seent hem both ways and have to wonder if the propreitary units are really worth it.\n \n I am looking at 14-16\" scopes for galaxy viewing, but have still not decided whether I should make that plunge or not. The biggest problem I see is easy portability. While I have some fine star viewing real estate around my place during the summer, in the winter it is not so hot.",

He ws interested in astronomy and had just finished building a 15\" one for himself. I asked what it woudl cost to do a 10\". He expalined the process of grindingthe mirrors, etc... and quoted me $1500. I told him that $2000 was more in line with all involved, and I wante first class coatings, etc.....\n \n My motorized base I had the guys in the shop build. It was overkill. It is a LOT mroe powerful and a LOT smoother than is really needed. \n \n I have looked at some different telescope building pages, and I think that if you wanted to build it yourself, grind mirrors, etc... you could probably do it for under $500.",

There are a lot of cheaper scopes out there. I have on old 3.5 or 4\" bushnell that I picked up at wal mart for less than $100. I still use it frequently. \n \n There are a ton of differences as far as quality. There are commerical 8-10\" scopes out there for under $500. You are not going to be looking at them at 800x, but they still should give you plenty of enjoyment.\n \n Personally, I would get a cheaper glass to play with before trying to acquire a high quality unit that you could well pay thousands for. You might also check newspapers, garage sales, etc... A lot of folks buy telescopes for themselves or their kids, use them a couple of times, then they end up in the closet. I have heard of some folks getting great deal on secondhand scopes (12\" for less than $200). A reflecting telescope is little mroe than a couple of mirrors. they do not wear out.",

From the diagrams, it appears that the tube need not be bigger. However, another article did mention that the aperture size is important. In the case of the reflector telescope, I think the maximum aperture is the primary mirror diameter and is not increased with use of a larger tube size.",
