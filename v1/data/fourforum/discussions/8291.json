I had the pleasure of standing in line with the people who screwed up those ballots. They had no idea what or who they were voting for. I actually had to tell several of them about the Constitutional amendments that were on the ballot. Bush won Florida in 2000. He may have lost if the ballots had been counted according to the will of the people who voted. But since there are laws that prevent votes from being counted if the person votes for 2 different presidents, Bush won. He won according to the ballots that were cast in a fashion in which the will of the voter could be determined. If the will could not be determined, that ballot was not counted. These are the facts, there is no evidence to the contrary. \n On the next point, what rights have you lost?",

They counted SS funds as general funds and Clinto raided $158 billion from SS over 5 years.\n \n YES, our debt is a lot differnt than it has been during other wars. For one, we did not go into other wars already carrying an unsustainable debt burden. \n \n Second, the debt taken on during this war is more than the debt taken on during WWI and WWII COMBINED. There is an easy to follow chart at http://www.cedarcomm.com/~stevelm1/usdebt.htm that shows the debt since WWII (1938). Then national debt did not even hit 2 trillion unitl the mid 80's. Bush has already boosted it more than that on his own, and he is not even done yet. \n \n We fought the entire Korean war, a much larger action than this current fiasco, with very little increase in public debt. We fought the entire vietnam war, also a much larger military action, with very little increase in public debt. In order to compare our current debt load to any other wartime debt load with a straight face, you have to go back to WWII or WWI. Even then, you have some serious problems in that the comparison only holds if you use either percentage of GDP or percentage of increase, since in real dollars this debt load is much larger than both of those increases.\n \n The theird major differeince is that in both of those cases, our future ability to pay off our debt was very high. Going into WWII, we were well aware of the fact that WWII would be a massive economic boom for the US because we would have the only intact industrial infrastructure on the planet when it was over. There was great attention paid to this on all levels. There are multiple articles and scholarly papers written before and during the war that are dedicated primarily to the anticipated impact of the war on future US economics and all indicate a bright future. They were right. We basically went into both WWI and WWII secure int he knowledge that teh debt we were incurring was essentially an investment in US economic expansion. there was no question in either case that the post war economic climate would allow us to pay off our debt or at least grow our economy to the point that the debt was insignificant (which is in reality the same as paying it off). \n \n Today, we have squandered our industrial infrastructure. There is little or nothing left of it. Oru economy is turning and the XXXXX in the white house is charging on the national credit card like there is no tomorrow and there are, as far as I can see, no plans, as far as I can see, whatsoever as to how we are goin to pay down this record deficit expansion.",

But sometimes I just can't resist, know what I mean?!\n\n \n Yep. for the most part I have been pretty busy lately. I wander through occasionally and read posts, but have not had much time to respond. I could not resist when this guy informed us that he was a genius and an Ex marine. Ex marine I could buy since entry requiremetns for military service are minimal in the US, until I looked a little closer and noted that he sounds a lot mroe like a high schoool kid with a hard on for the marines than an ex marine.\n \n I figured if there was a genius in our midst, I would check him out. I am horribly disappointed. The definition of \"genius\" being used must be one that I am unfamiliar with. Using the definition here, my dog may well be a certifiable genius.\n \n I hope your exams go well. I think that a lot of the folks here still in school are either finishing up exams, or enjoying the drinken care free days of summer. I am guessing that JP is busy with his new business. George should be getting moved into his new house and he has some summer projects (I think). Hopefully folks will be back in the fall and the 4forums sommunity will egt back together. I am not impressed with the quality of some of our new recruits. Some are ok, but some are just dumber than dirt.\n \n \n \n \nI just thought I'd give some pointed advice about logical debating, especially where economics is concerned. And I read this entire thread about three times before I responded and nothing you have said has made any sense.\n \n However, I will now get out of the way if you wish to further humiliate yourself.\n\n \n I grow weary of humiliating the mentally deficient.
