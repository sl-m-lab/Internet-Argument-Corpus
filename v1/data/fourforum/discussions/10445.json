   "Evolution theory is not science at all, it is faith. Period.\nWhile I disagree with your opinion I understand your suspicion towards faith based beliefs. If something relies on faith alone, how likely is it really?emoticon_xclown\n As it happens there is evidence for the Big Bang:\n \n Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation\n \n Perhaps the most conclusive (and certainly among the most carefully examined) piece of evidence for the Big Bang is the existence of an isotropic radiation bath that permeates the entire Universe known as the \"cosmic microwave background\" (CMB). The word \"isotropic\" means the same in all directions; the degree of anisotropy of the CMB is about one part in a thousand. In 1965, two young radio astronomers, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, almost accidentally discovered the CMB using a small, well-calibrated horn antenna. It was soon determined that the radiation was diffuse, emanated unifromly from all directions in the sky, and had a temperature of approximately 2.7 Kelvin (ie 2.7 degrees above absolute zero). Initially, they could find no satisfactory explanation for their observations, and considered the possibility that their signal may have been due to some undetermined systematic noise. They even considered the possibility that it was due to \"a white dielectric substance\" (ie pigeon droppings) in their horn! However, it soon came to their attention through Robert Dicke and Jim Peebles of Princeton that this background radiation had in fact been predicted years earlier by George Gamow as a relic of the evolution of the early Universe. This background of microwaves was in fact the cooled remnant of the primeval fireball - an echo of the Big Bang.\n \n If the universe was once very hot and dense, the photons and baryons would have formed a plasma, ie a gas of ionized matter coupled to the radiation through the constant scattering of photons off ions and electrons. As the universe expanded and cooled there came a point when the radiation (photons) decoupled from the matter - this happened about a few hundred thousand years after the Big Bang. That radiation cooled and is now at 2.7 Kelvin. The fact that the spectrum (see figure) of the radiation is almost exactly that of a \"black body\" (a physicists way of describing a perfect radiator) implies that it could not have had its origin through any prosaic means. This has led to the death of the steady state theory for example. In fact the CMB spectrum is a black body to better than 1% accuracy over more than a factor of 1000 in wavelength. This is a much more accurate black body than any we can make in the laboratory!\n \n By the early 1970's it became clear that the CMB sky is hotter in one direction and cooler in the opposite direction, with the temperature difference being a few mK (or about 0.1% of the overall temperature). The pattern of this temperature variation on the sky is known as a \"dipole\", and is exactly what is expected if we are moving through the background radiation at high speed in the direction of the hot part. The inference is that our entire local group of galaxies is moving in a particular direction at about 600 km/s. In the direction we are moving the wavelengths of the radiation are squashed together (a blue-shift), making the sky appear hotter there, while in the opposite direction the wavelengths are stretched out (redshift), making the sky appear colder there. When this dipole pattern, due to our motion, is removed, the CMB sky appears incredibly isotropic. Further investigations, including more recent ones by the COBE satellite (eg Smoot et. al.), confirmed the virtual isotropy of the CMB to better than one part in ten-thousand.\n \n Given this level of isotropy, together with the accurate black-body spectrum, any attempt to interpret the origin of the CMB as due to present astrophysical phenomena (i.e. stars, dust, radio galaxies, etc.) is no longer credible. Therefore, the only satisfactory explanation for the existence of the CMB lies in the physics of the early Universe. \n http://www.astro.ubc.ca/people/scott/cmb_intro.html",

Some 20 supporters were in the courtroom.\n \n \"I still don't understand what I'm being charged for and who is charging me,\" he said.\n \n Kent Hovind, who often calls himself \"Dr. Dino,\" has been sparring with the IRS for at least 17 years on his claims that he is employed by God, receives no income, has no expenses and owns no property.\n \n \"The debtor apparently maintains that as a minister of God, everything he owns belongs to God and he is not subject to paying taxes to the United States on money he receives for doing God's work,\" U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Lewis Killian Jr. wrote when he dismissed a claim from Hovind in 1996.\n \n Hovind, an avowed creationist, has widely publicized his \"standing offer\" to pay $250,000 to anyone who can provide scientific evidence of evolution.\n \n \"No one has ever observed a dog produce a non-dog,\" Hovind once wrote in reply to a New York Times article.\n \n In the indictment unsealed Thursday, a grand jury alleges that Kent Hovind failed to pay $473,818 in federal income, Social Security and Medicare taxes on employees at his Creation Science Evangelism/Ministry between March 31, 2001, and Jan. 31, 2004.\n \n As part of the ministry, Hovind operated the Dinosaur Adventure Land at 5800 N. Palafox St., which included rides, a museum and a science center. He also sold literature, videos, CDs and other materials and provided lecture services and live debates for a fee.\n \n The indictment alleges Kent Hovind paid his employees in cash and labeled them \"missionaries\" to avoid payroll tax and FICA requirements.\n \n On Thursday, a message on the Dinosaur Adventure Land telephone welcomed visitors to the place \"where dinosaurs and the Bible meet\" and stated that the museum and science center were closed temporarily.\n \n The indictment also says the Hovinds' made cash withdrawals from AmSouth Bank in a manner that evaded federal requirements for reporting cash transactions.\n \n The withdrawals were for $9,500 or $9,600, just below the $10,000 starting point for reporting cash transactions.\n \n Most of the withdrawals were days apart. For example, the indictment shows three withdrawals of $9,500 each on July 20, July 23 and July 26 in 2001.\n \n The indictment also charges Kent Hovind with impeding an IRS investigation.\n \n Among the ways he is accused of doing:\n \n \u0095 Filing a frivolous lawsuit against the agency demanding damages for criminal trespass.\n \n \u0095 Filing an injunction against an IRS special agent.\n \n \u0095 Filing false complaints against the IRS for false arrest, excessive use of force and theft.\n \n \u0095 Making threats against investigators and those cooperating with the investigation.\n \n Judge Davis released the Hovinds from custody pending their trial, which will be scheduled during their arraignment at 2 p.m. Monday.\n \n Over Kent Hovind's protests, the judge took away his passport and guns Hovind claimed belonged to his church.\n \n Hovind argued that he needs his passport to continue his evangelism work. He said \"thousands and thousands\" are waiting to hear him preach in South Africa next month.\n \n But Davis agreed with Assistant U.S. Attorney Michelle Heldmyer, who argued that \"like-minded people\" might secret Hovind away if he left the country.\n \n As for the guns, Davis said \"ownership was not the issue.\"\n \n Kent Hovind also has had run-ins with state authorities.\n \n In April, Circuit Judge Michael Allen ordered the buildings at Dinosaur Adventure Land closed because Hovind failed to obtain a building permit during the 2002 construction. The outdoor theme park was allowed to stay open.\n \n Members of Creation Science Evangelism said at the time that building permits violated their \"deeply held\" religious beliefs.\n \n While the building permit case was tied up in a four-year court battle, ownership of the theme park was turned over to Glen Stoll, who works with Hovind on legal issues and is based in Washington.\n \n Last year, the U.S. attorney in Seattle filed a lawsuit against Stoll, charging him with encouraging people to avoid tax payments by claiming to be religious entities, according to news reports. \n",

   "Evolution theory is not science at all, it is faith. Period. \n \n How can I conclude that? Because an examination of the evidence shows that a bias/ ideology/ Godless belief system is the only real evidence for evolution theory:\n\n \n Well, now, here's the thing:\n \n A hypothesis of special creation of all things (such as is described in the bible) is inconsistent with the evidence we can elicit from living things today. For instance, there's the amount of non-functional DNA we share with other creatures, in particular the other apes. With shared functional DNA, now, one could make a case for economy of design, but deliberately putting the same broken genes and garbage DNA into two entirely seperate species?\n \n Then there's the fact that some creatures have far better 'designed' bits than others for no readily apparent reason. A good example is the octopus eye, whose retina is supplied with blood from the rear rather than the front, both anchoring the retina more securely (no detached retina problems) and avoiding the 'blind spot' mammalian eyes possess. There's no reason at all for a designer capable of making an octupus to use the inferior mammalian design.\n \n Then there's the issue of vestigial features. Vestigial doesn't necessarily mean 'useless', more properly it describes something that is 'overengineered' for the purpose it currently serves, and often looks very much like a crippled version of a feature possessed by some other species. Ostrich wings, for example, may be useful for balancing when running, or in mating rituals, but they don't need to be wings in order to serve those purposes. Their complex and delicate internal structure is clearly 'designed' to allow flight, but their stunted development and the practical impossibility of such a big bird achieving self-powered flight make them a vestigial structure. Again, what rationale can be made for this being the work of a designer?\n \n Then there's the fossil record. Try as one might to twist the evidence to fit a biblical flood, it just won't go. Paleontologists have found spider tracks sandwiched in sandstone layers. Imagine, if you can, the delicate impressions of a spider's footsteps surviving a deluge sufficient to suspend and deposit yards and yards of sand atop them. Hydrodynamic sorting of fossils, or burial order, doesn't fit either, since it requires that we pretend all dinosaurs were large and slow moving (they weren't) and that all mammals are small, agile and fast-moving (they aren't).\n \n On and on it goes. If we take evolution off the table completely and look at the evidence before us, we have no explanation that fits. Special creation simply doesn't add up. With all creation myths falsified, what are we supposed to do? Just pretend the history of life on earth doesn't matter, or should be ignored?\n \n Evolution isn't what you come up with when you apply atheist thinking. Evolution is what you come up with when you discount all the extant hypotheses that don't fit the facts, be they religiously inspired or otherwise.\n \n Now, you may hold your hand up and complain that we're not admitting the possibility of some kind of divine guiding hand steering or helping evolution. And that's fair enough; we generally don't, for two different reasons:\n \n First, it doesn't really add anything to the theory; it doesn't increase its power to explain what we see. So while you can of course choose to believe that's what's happening, it doesn't have any scientific value.\n \n Secondly, there's arguably some merit in the attitude that religion has had its chance and blown it. For thousands of years religions have claimed to bear upon their backs the infallible word of god. Now, if the bible had been saying all along - centuries before the technology existed to verify it - that god coaxed organisms into evolving from simpler organisms over millions of years, that would be compelling evidence that the bible was accurate and divinely inspired, since it would contain accurate predictions (which no man could have made) about what we should find when we look into our DNA or beneath the ground. But it doesn't make those predictions. So why should we now pay attention when Intelligent Design evangelists do a 6000-year-too-late handbrake turn and invent a new faith-based explanation for the evidence? After all, they have no divine mandate to do so - it's the bible that's supposedly the word of god; they're just making stuff up as they go along.",

   "Actually its 14 billion years. Hovind is not claiming what science does.\n \n That is also factually incorrect. Matter can be destroyed. Anybody notice the sun shining? Anyone remember all those nuclear weapons. Anybody remember e=mc^2?\n \n Good questions all. Science says \"We don't know\" how about that, we don't know everything.\n \n Thus it could not be nothing. Only matter has temperature and density. And a very dense (very very very dense!) region is most definitely NOT nothing! And the energy present is related both to density and temperature! Lots of energy there - indeed nearly infinite energy.\n \n \nAs you know, when matter is heated, it expands. For something to be hot enough to explode faster than the sped of light, it would have to be larger than our minds can comprehend.[/QUOTE]\n \n Nope. The original very dense very hot region expanded because it was so hot and so dense. All that energy has to go somewhere - expansion does the trick! And my how it did expand.\n \n Actually science is not sure whether expansion will continue indefineitely, whether it will stop and remain stable, or whether it will collapse. Last I heard collapse was not given good odds. Hovind is probably behind the curve here.\n \n Given there was no reference point I wonder if Hovind was looking at the universe from above or below. Depending on perspective it could have been spinning either way - if indeed it was spinning - and if it was spinning what was the spin relative to?\n \n But the law of angular momentum does not require that all parts of a spinning object spin in the same way now does it. If so then something like a rotary engine for an aircraft would not be possible!\n \n Not true, twas something that exploded (a dense hot small region) and it took the better part of 8 billion years for our arrival on the scene![/QUOTE]\n \n What's 6 billion years, more or less? jk. You must remember that KH recorded this seminar 6 years ago. Science has re-estimated the age of the universe since then.\n \n Matter can be taken apart, yes. Matter can seemingly disappear, yes. Matter cannot be destroyed (as in disappear from the universe completely). Also, what does the shining sun have to do with anything?\n \n I know the answers to those questions: God. Of coarse, that is assuming that the Big Bang really did occur.\n \n Actually, the heating and the expanding would have had to happen at the same time. When an object is heated, it expands as it heats, neither can occur without the other. Thereby, the heating must have occurred at the same time of the explosion.

Creationists have these asinine ideas that redefining dates by immaterial amounts results in their complete lack of credibility.

And matter can be destroyed, or more accurately converted. Fire does this very well. The net weight of the log before you burn it is far greater then the matter of the ash. Matter has been destroyed and converted into heat and light. The shining sun is a perfect example of this, taking a nuclear reaction's matter and converting it into energy.

How can a expansion occur with a prior cause? You're saying the reaction and cause happen at the same time. Show me an example that does that. \n \n \nWhen an object is heated, it expands as it heats, neither can occur without the other.\n\n \n But you said that they happen at the same time, then you contradict yourself. Make up your mind. And high pressure systems can prevent expansion while raising temperature. \n \n \nThereby, the heating must have occurred at the same time of the explosion.\n\n \n What? You just said that expansion occurs after heating. How can you now say that they occur at the same time? \n \n Ah the life of a Creationist, can't be bothered by their own contradictions\n \n \nFor my final disproving statement, I need to know if evos believe that the matter had always been there or not.

   "Evolution theory is not science at all, it is faith. Period. \n \n How can I conclude that? Because an examination of the evidence shows that a bias/ ideology/ Godless belief system is the only real evidence for evolution theory:\n \n evolutionist Stephen Jay Gould: \"Our ways of learning about the world are strongly influenced by the social pre-conceptions and biased modes of thinking that each scientist must apply to any problem.\"\n \n Evolutionary biologist Richard Lewontin said: \"we have a prior commitment to materialism. It is not that the methods and institutions of science somehow compel us to accept a material explanation of the phenomenal world, but, on the contrary, that we are forced by our priori adherence to material causes to create an apparatus of investigation and a set of concepts that produce material explanations, no matter how counter-intuitive...Moreover, that materialism is an absolute, for we cannot allow a divine foot in the door.\"\n\n \n \n that quote just about says it all. Naturalistic explanations are not the result of scientific investigations...instead, naturalism is the assumption on which all investigations are based. In otherwords, the paradigm of naturalistic/materialistic causes is taken for granted...and instead of considering how the real physical evidence bears on the paradigm itself, todays scientists only wish to investigate the evidence within the naturalistic paradigm. Problems or contradictions that may occur in these investigations in no way are interpreted as a problem with the paradigm itself...instead, any contradictory data are just said to be \"unexplained\" or \"mysterious.\" Contradictions are also just hand-waved as \"different points of view.\" For example, the idea that Darwin required gradualism for natural selection to operate in no way was invalidated when Gould said gradualism simply wasn't found in the fossil record.

It has nothing to do with immaterial explanations, such a constant would have been material. Indeed its been making a bit of a comeback of late!\n \n http://www.physicstoday.org/vol-58/iss-11/p31.html\n \n \nIn thinking of Einstein's mistakes, one immediately recalls what Einstein (in a conversation with George Gamow2) called the biggest blunder he had made in his life: the introduction of the cosmological constant. After Einstein had completed the formulation of his theory of space, time, and gravitation-the general theory of relativity-he turned in 1917 to a consideration of the spacetime structure of the whole universe. He then encountered a problem. Einstein was assuming that, when suitably averaged over many stars, the universe is uniform and essentially static, but the equations of general relativity did not seem to allow a time-independent solution for a universe with a uniform distribution of matter. So Einstein modified his equations, by including a new term involving a quantity that he called the cosmological constant. Then it was discovered that the universe is not static, but expanding. Einstein came to regret that he had needlessly mutilated his original theory. It may also have bothered him that he had missed predicting the expansion of the universe.\n \n \n",

Unfortunately, no one seems to have told the bumblebees this, and these poor, uninformed creatures still buzz about, unaware of the fact that they are 'aerodynamically incompatible with flight'.\n \n So lets think about it rationally, is the bumblebee too stupid to realize that it can't actually fly or are the original mathematical calculations that came up with this theory of non-flight flawed?\n \n Lets go back to where this whole thing started. There was this Swiss aerodynamicist who, at some posh dinner, got talking to a biologist who started asking about the flight of bees. So the aerodynamicist scribbled the calculation on the back of a napkin, but seeing as he was at a dinner party (and therefore possibly on the tipsy side and uninterested in talking shop), he simplified it. He assumed that bees have a smooth, rigid wing, like the wing of an airplane, and he had to guess the weight and wing area of Mr Bee. Shockingly, the calculations suggested that the bee generated insufficient lift to be able to fly, but the aerodynamicist had had enough by this point and went back to getting drunk.\n \n However, the story spread and unfortunately wasn't taken as a lesson that a mathematical model of something is not the same as the real thing and can be wrong. Instead, the shocking rumour spread that bees should physically be incapable of flight and far too many people decided to believe the maths rather than mother nature.\n \n Anyone who played with a dead bumblebee as a kid (was that just me?) will have noticed that their wings are nothing like the wings of a plane. Instead, they are not rigid and they bend and twist during flight. In reality, the beating bee's wings have more similarity with a helicopter rotor than a airplane wing.\n \n A recent model of how rapid oscillations, like those created by a bee flapping it's wings 130 times a second, affect the air around them have, in fact, shown that bumblebees can fly. Insects appear to fly in a sea of vortexes moving against the main current of the air. I'm sure the bees will be glad to know that they don't defy the laws of nature after all.\n \n So no one ever proved that a bumblebee can't fly. They simply illustrated that a simple mathematical model is not appropriate for describing the bumblebee's flight. However, the myth that a bumblebee can't fly is still flying around, unaware that it is, unlike Mr Bee, the one that is wrong.\n \n Regarding the bolded, that was the only point I was trying to make at the time. That Bumble bees defy the laws of flight. It had been a widely promoted urban myth if you will, and I plead guilty to promoting it. But you have just confirmed how disingenuous and even slanderous you are to take such an innocent and widely held belief that I stated and twisting it into me saying the birds had jet engines coming out of their butts. Which clearly explains why as the slanderous and philosophical coward and the liar that you are, that you posted page 3 of the thread and not the specific post where I made such a claim. Because you know if you posted my actual post, everyone would clearly understand that I was speaking to the fact that bees simply seem to defy the laws of flight, and nothing as extreme as you want to attribute to me. After all, your goal isn't to tell the truth but to libel me.",

On the one hand you insist that Dragons in no way ever existed, yet in your evidence to prove they didn't exist you referred to wing span to mass ratios as evidence that the implication that they could fly is ridiculous.\n \n \n Because? Under that logic, saying that a argument against birds with the wing spans of hundreds of feet using the same arguments are ridiculous. \n \n Do you even understand the wing span to mass to muscle relation?\n \n \nTell me how that is the least bit rational argument ? First you say they couldn't exist then you show how their wing spans weren't in proportion to their bodies to allow for flight.\n\n \n I don't see how that's ridiculous. \n \n \nQUESTION... If they never existed, how do you know their wingspans per body proportion?\n\n \n By mythological statements about their alleged sizes. Furthermore we know just how much lift and energy is required to move mass off the ground. That can be correlated to necessary wing muscle and area necessary to generate such lift. Now if you put flapping in, the muscle requirements exponentially grow. Birds that primarily soar have much less wing muscle then birds that rely on flapping to move. With that exponential muscle and corresponding wing mass, the heat loss is exponential, thus increasing the necessary food requirements. So adding up the muscle, heat loss, size and necessary food requirements, the idea of a medieval type dragon is ridiculous. Now the Asian dragon myth is even more insane as those don't have wings yet can fly and even maneuver like a insect in flight. \n \n Just because you lack the engineering understanding along with biological background doesn't make us wrong: it just makes you foolish. \n \n \nBut as usual you make off the wall claims with absolutely nothing to support your moronic and irrational contentions.\n\n \n Read above.

But that was decades ago. Seems typical of the science put forth by creationists. But, of course, scientific laws are only statements of what is observed. Once the concepts of vortex and dynamic stall were developed, it became clear that party calculations of aerodynamics were nonsense and the \"laws\" of aerodynamics were amended. Bumblebee flight does not violate any law of physics.\n \n It demonstrates the utmost ignorance for any creationist to cite this example in any debate about creationism v. evolution.",

   "You may as well not post cut and paste from the bible because I don&#8217;t read it.\n \n If you can&#8217;t argue in your own words I am not interested.\n\n My words are as empty and shallow as yours are. But these words from the bible are the meat of life and never come back void. Sure, you can ignore them and insist that they don't have any influence on you, but when all is said and done in this life, they will be all that truly mattered. I also find it interesting that you so fear the TRUTH that you are afraid to even read it. So I repeat.\n \nStop ignoring the meat of the message I am offering to you. Take this biblical warning seriously if you have even one ounce of wisdom: \n Rom 1:18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness,\n Rom 1:19 because that which is known about God is evident within them; for God made it evident to them.\n Rom 1:20 For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse.\n Rom 1:21 For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their speculations, and their foolish heart was darkened.\n Rom 1:22 Professing to be wise, they became fools,\n Rom 1:23 and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and crawling creatures.\n Rom 1:24 Therefore God gave them over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, so that their bodies would be dishonored among them.\n Rom 1:25 For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.\n Rom 1:26 For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural,\n Rom 1:27 and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error.\n Rom 1:28 And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not proper,\n Rom 1:29 being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, evil; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice; {they are} gossips,\n Rom 1:30 slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents,\n Rom 1:31 without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful;\n Rom 1:32 and although they know the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, they not only do the same, but also give hearty approval to those who practice them.\n \n",

I must assume that this lunatic is communicating from some institution and is safely being held behind locked doors and is under 24 hour watch by qualified medical personnel. \n \n So it becomes painfully obvious to me that attempting to reason with this sick and disturbed lunatic is a complete waste of my time as there is no reasoning with him. He will continue to argue such insane positions as I believe that because TQ insulted my ability to do math, and I responded by saying that I reject his atheistic and secular world view, that from that exchange, one must conclude that I then believe that anyone who relies on MATH must then be an ATHEIST. \n \n And only in his very sick and disturbed mind can my stating the FACT that scientists have studied the issue of BUMBLE BEES defying the laws of flight for decades, that in his psychosis induced mind have I argued and still believe that BEES CAN'T FLY AT ALL.

   "How consistently hypocritical of you to criticize my reposting the explanation of what this obnoxious child represents around here, rather than criticize the liar for his repeated corruption of what I have said. emoticon_xgood\n\n \n Incorrect. An explanation provides a reasoned, evidence based argument. All you did was go off on an insult filled tirade that provides absolutely no evidence of your claims. Furthermore, an explanation provides specific points and rebuttals, something your spamming has yet to to do. An explanation explicitly lays out specific arguments and corresponding evidence. A tirade fills posts with accusations and insults. \n \n T.Q insults you for your inability to do math (in addition to other things) and you reply calling his world view \"atheistic and secular.\" He directly cited your inability to do math as part of his reason he insults you.\n \n Do you reject that this happened?\n \n Do you reject that you stated that Taz, who originally posted the joke on man's creation from dirt did not screw up the grammar, but I, who posted the joke verbatim did? Thus presenting the argument that you believe grammar is dependent upon the person, not the statement being made? \n \n Do you reject that this happened?\n \n I stated that oil was a hydrocarbon. You claimed it was not. You then cited from your own source a quote that you believed proved your point and followed it with a statement proclaiming that oil was not a hydrocarbon?\n \n Do you reject that this happened?\n \n You posted a picture you believed was a flying reptile that lived during the dinosaur era that was shot and killed by civil war soldiers as evidence of creation that was later proved to be a TV prop.\n \n Do you reject that this happened?\n \n You posted a link to Incan stone art that you alleged was evidence of man living with dinosaurs. It was later proved that the villagers had copied comic book art on to rocks to sell to dinosaurs. \n \n Do you reject that this happened?\n \n I can keep going. The ignorant one here is you.",

   "I guess what gets me so flummoxed about this obnoxious child/troll is that we have here a member who is so absolutely dishonest, so blatant in his arrogance and delusions, that he feels he can state what my deep seeded beliefs are based on things I have never, ever said in any way. This liar must know he is perverting my beliefs but has such little respect for the truth and so little shame that he isn't even embarrassed about not only misrepresenting what I have said, but actually arguing and defending that fallacious stance after repeated denials by me, and my insistence that his interpretation of what I have said is absolutely false. \n \n Only in this generation do we have people like this mentally ill troll who will insist on telling another person what he believes after he has repeatedly told him he is wrong. I can't imagine a psychosis so severe in a person who is functioning in society that he will refuse to accept it when another person says NO, that isn't what I said or meant to say. I must assume that this lunatic is communicating from some institution and is safely being held behind locked doors and is under 24 hour watch by qualified medical personnel. \n \n So it becomes painfully obvious to me that attempting to reason with this sick and disturbed lunatic is a complete waste of my time as there is no reasoning with him. He will continue to argue such insane positions as I believe that because TQ insulted my ability to do math, and I responded by saying that I reject his atheistic and secular world view, that from that exchange, one must conclude that I then believe that anyone who relies on MATH must then be an ATHEIST. \n \n And only in his very sick and disturbed mind can my stating the FACT that scientists have studied the issue of BUMBLE BEES defying the laws of flight for decades, that in his psychosis induced mind have I argued and still believe that BEES CAN'T FLY AT ALL. Forget that I was speaking only of bumble bees in my original claim, and forget that I wasn't saying even they can't fly but was saying that they DEFY THE LAWS OF FLIGHT. To his disturbed reality, evidently that means I don't believe that any bees can fly anywhere despite a lifetime of seeing bees fly. Can you appreciate how sick such a person who makes such a claim as this obvious child is?\n \n That none of that matters to this mentally ill person is evidence that he has lost his grip on reality. And that is the most gracious conclusion I can come to here. Otherwise, if I don't conclude that he is mentally ill, the only other option is to conclude that he is a committed fabricator of facts, a false witness, a falsifier of reality, a maligner of his opponents stated beliefs, a purposeful perjurer, and an unapologetic prevaricator who prefers to lie about a persons beliefs in opposition to the stated truth of what another person insists they actually believe. \n \n So which is it? Either way what is painfully obvious is that attempting to reason with such a person is a complete waste of time. as he has proven to be beyond the capability of rational discourse. My only option if admin refuses to ban such a member, is to ignore him. So consider it done. His lies aren't worth defending against anyway since everyone can plainly see how he distorts what others say.",

Why be redundant in my defense just because you are redundant in your lies? For example, YOU SAID THIS:\n Do you reject that this happened?\n \n Do you reject that you stated that Taz, who originally posted the joke on man's creation from dirt did not screw up the grammar, but I, who posted the joke verbatim did? Thus presenting the argument that you believe grammar is dependent upon the person, not the statement being made? \n \n Here's another example of you attempting to claim that your lousy grammar in your thread title \"which is in my siggy below\" was a copy of this Taz guy from the \"Evolution Forum\" whom you allegedly just C&Pd it from. So your claim is that if your grammar was bad, then so was his. But you posted a link to Taz's thread on that forum and his wording wasn't the ignorant gibberish yours is. Repost his link to the title on the other forum and prove me wrong if you are telling the truth that I am judging you harshly while giving him a pass. ALSO, his thread title wasn't a JOKE TITLE as you claim it was in any way. You atheists mocked and joked about it condescendingly as you often do, but Taz wasn't joking if my recollection is clear. And I submit that you wont link to that thread on the other forum again because you know you are lying about Taz in saying that his grammar was corrupted as your is, and your claim that it was a joke thread of some sort. Once again it is impossible for you to be honest in anything you say here.\n \n So why should I go through any more of your lies and distortions, and repeatedly defend against them when in every case that I respond it only further proves how famously dishonest you are? :xbanghead\n \n Just for the heck of it I went back and found your quoted post and my response to it here: http://www.4forums.com/political/358596-post50.html Just by what is posted we can see that your claim that your verbiage and taz's was identical and it was me holding you to a different grammatical standard is a blatant and obvious lie. But what is interesting is that the link that previously went to Taz's thread in the EVC forum, now goes to another thread where Taz isn't even participating. Weird huh? Did you go back and change the thread links so your lie couldn't be proven? Is that why you are apparently on another trip and haven't responded to this post yet? Or will you just do us all a favor and go the way of daewoo, your mentor in lying, and disappear!?!?!?",

It is only you who raped the statement you were attempting to make.\"\n \n But after this post:\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/358633-post51.html\n \n Particularly this:\n \n \"Tell me, how is his statement: \"If god made human from dirt, how come there are still dirt around?\"\n \n Grammatically different from mine?\n \n \"If god made human from dirt, how come there are still dirt around?\"\"\n \n You dropped the entire argument. I posted the quote and link and you ran away like a coward. \n \n EvC Forum: Human Evolution (re: If evolved from apes, why still apes?)\n \n Post #10\n But I fully expect you to pretend that I never did that. \n \n I do enjoy how you think that grammar is dependent upon the person making the statement rather than the actual words being said.\n \n But what can I expect from someone who said oil wasn't a hydrocarbon, bees can't fly according to science, comic book stone art proves man and dinos lived together, tv props prove creationism, math is atheism and a whole host of truly asinine statements?",

   "Why haven't you actually reposted Taz's link from the EVC Forum Patrick? Rather than this other one which Taz isn't even participating in? More lies to cover up huh!!!\n \n \nas usual, Arch is wrong.\n\n \n Arch is only wrong for continuing to respond to a pinhead like you and actually give you attention which you don't deserve. This will be the last time I make that mistake, but it's just too good an opportunity to once again focus attention on your sick and corrupted psychosis.\n \n \nHere's what Tester said: \"On the other hand, it is Archangel that I see, habitually, ascribe positions to others that are contrary to what they have said. IMHO, it is simply absurd to see him so \"flummoxed\" by OC.\"\n \n The statement you bolded just did what Tester argued you did. You ascribe positions to others that are contrary to what they said.\n\n \n You mean my bolded statement? This one from the post above, don't you?\n I NEVER TOOK HIS ARGUMENTS, CORRUPTED THEM AND FED THEM BACK TO HIM AS I INSISTED THAT HE SAID SOMETHING HE NEVER SAID. How would you like it if in a debate you said that born again believers are brainwashed sheeple, which you probably do believe,and I continued to post months later that Tester debated and argued that all christians are devoted hatemongers who are dedicated to killing all atheists!!!\n Now, note the larger red bolded in that bolded question of mine to tester! Are you either so ignorant, dishonest or insane that you can't tell that when someone says \"How would you like it if\" IS AN EXAMPLE AND NOT REPEATING A CLAIM OF WHAT SOMEONE SAID, AT ALL? Yet, you say that in my example, I am ascribing positions to others which are contrary to what they said!!! You just can't debate without corrupting and misrepresenting what another person says can you obnoxious child! It is beyond you to rationally comprehend what someone says, then to interpret it as they intended and process it honestly before responding to it objectively. This generally normal capability of human communication just doesn't exist within you does it as you continue to claim I am wrong while being totally blind to the corruption of what I say which you represent!!! BUT HOLD ON FOLKS, THERE'S MORE BLATANT DISHONESTY AND PURPOSEFUL MISINTERPRETATION FROM THIS LYING TROLL WHICH HE USES IN AN ATTEMPT TO FALSELY DEMONIZE ME, AND ALL IN THE FOLLOWING QUOTE OF HIS!!!\n \n \nBut thanks again for proving that you believe that your view and only your view is what Christanity is. Any attack on you is an attack on Christanity. Insane, but expected.\n\n \n AND HERE IT IS ONCE AGAIN!!! So you are holding up the \"WHAT IF\" example which I bolded above as a hypothetical question for tester, as an absolute statement by me which in your sick and deluded mind is making a statement of fact now, rather than asking a hypothetical question, right?!?!? Now here's a case and a place when it is absolutely appropriate to use the term, \"I REST MY CASE\" since you have just shown 2 ways that you can pervert and misinterpret the same question as you attempt to attribute it to me as a statement of fact. As if everyone else who read that question in my post is too stupid to see through your dishonesty. \n \n Exposing the lies and dishonesty you represent is like shooting ducks in a pond it's so easy. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \n You called me a liar on a list of things I said you made. \n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/360364-post255.html\n \n Why do you refuse to address that post?\n \n If you think I lied, why don't you say that you reject that those instances happened? \n \n I twist what you say, but you can't prove it. Furthermore, you outright refuse to even address posts detailing what you claim are lies.\n\n \n The reason I don't bother responding ONCE AGAIN to your lies is because I have answered them so many times in the past. Why be redundant in my defense just because you are redundant in your lies? For example, YOU SAID THIS:\n Do you reject that this happened?\n \n Do you reject that you stated that Taz, who originally posted the joke on man's creation from dirt did not screw up the grammar, but I, who posted the joke verbatim did? Thus presenting the argument that you believe grammar is dependent upon the person, not the statement being made? \n \n Here's another example of you attempting to claim that your lousy grammar in your thread title \"which is in my siggy below\" was a copy of this Taz guy from the \"Evolution Forum\" whom you allegedly just C&Pd it from. So your claim is that if your grammar was bad, then so was his. But you posted a link to Taz's thread on that forum and his wording wasn't the ignorant gibberish yours is. Repost his link to the title on the other forum and prove me wrong if you are telling the truth that I am judging you harshly while giving him a pass. ALSO, his thread title wasn't a JOKE TITLE as you claim it was in any way. You atheists mocked and joked about it condescendingly as you often do, but Taz wasn't joking if my recollection is clear. And I submit that you wont link to that thread on the other forum again because you know you are lying about Taz in saying that his grammar was corrupted as your is, and your claim that it was a joke thread of some sort. Once again it is impossible for you to be honest in anything you say here.\n \n So why should I go through any more of your lies and distortions, and repeatedly defend against them when in every case that I respond it only further proves how famously dishonest you are? :xbanghead\n \n Just for the heck of it I went back and found your quoted post and my response to it here: http://www.4forums.com/political/358596-post50.html Just by what is posted we can see that your claim that your verbiage and taz's was identical and it was me holding you to a different grammatical standard is a blatant and obvious lie. But what is interesting is that the link that previously went to Taz's thread in the EVC forum, now goes to another thread where Taz isn't even participating. Weird huh? Did you go back and change the thread links so your lie couldn't be proven? Is that why you are apparently on another trip and haven't responded to this post yet? Or will you just do us all a favor and go the way of daewoo, your mentor in lying, and disappear!?!?!?",

Time could be described as non-existent (created as a measurement by man), relative (time depends on the objects speed versus lights speed and slows down as you go faster), or constant (time never really changes, but we are measured against the constant) depending on your point of view.\n \n Now here's something I wonder about, and forgive me for holes in it but it is purely off-the-wall brainstorming. If you find a wormhole that takes 10 minutes to traverse 300 lightyears from earth, then you will see the earth 300 years ago from that point in space, correct? Following that thinking, if you find the origin of the universe according to The Big Bang Theory, traverse a wormhole however many lightyears you deem the universe has existed away from it (ultimately hitting the edge of the universe) and traverse to that point in space nearly instantly so that you can see nearly the beginning of the universe, would you see nothing when you look back? Could you see the universe forming when you are occupying space that has already been formed millions of years later?",

So we all are mentally ill, correct?

   "Here's the problem with your chosen mythology, pandit.\n\n That's great, Archy! I appreciate the fact that in your inability to get my handle correct that you assign to me an Indian honorific that means \"wise or learned.\" Or perhaps it was by intention. I would never refer to myself as either wise or learned, although I am well educated.\n \nIt lacks any semblance of common sense, and based on the bolded, even you aren't stupid enough to claim it is absolutely proven in any way, shape or form.\n\n And your belief in the mythology of bronze age nomadic herdsmen somehow indicates common sense? Since when did magic become common sense? How is it anything but nonsense to claim certain knowledge because of something that you don't know?\n \n Perhaps if you made an effort to learn what science is and how it works you wouldn't make yourself look like such a fool by demanding \"proof.\" Science doesn't offer proof. It offers natural explanations of observations of natural phenomena. The other side of the coin is that you claim truth based on mythology that isn't based on a single bit of observable evidence. Of course I don't claim proof for science. I'm neither stupid nor a fool. On the other hand, you can't claim the same.\n \nHere's what I mean, we see before us and exist within an Earth which is a perfectly functioning and self sufficient ecosystem with an unbroken chain of symbiotic life forms which are not only interdependent to each other, but compliment each other on an environmentally balanced chemical level and food chain from the simplest single celled life forms up to the largest apex creatures in each of the species and ecosystems which inhabit this planet.\n\n I suspect that you don't actually understand any of the scientific terms that you used. Symbiotic life forms do not form interdependent chains. You only make yourself look foolish when you speak without learning at least the basics about which you speak. Neither predator/prey nor parasite/host relationships are symbiotic. The religious claptrap of the chain of being from primitive to advanced was rejected hundreds of years ago, with the development of real, empirical science. But still, we have the uneducated fundamentalists, like you, who are living in the middle ages.\n \nTo summarize your problem as simply as possible, your pseudo science claims that life spontaneously appeared by a complete accident 4.5 billion years ago in an unknown, unprovable and unverifiable environment which is completely based on theoretical but also unprovable so called observations which aren't actually real time observations at all since the event being discussed occurred this theoretical 4.5 billion years ago.\n\n Actually, no. I don't claim that life spontaneously appeared by accident 4.5 billion years ago. The earth is only about 4.5 billion years old and only a fool would assert that life arose with the formation of the earth. However, there is fossil evidence that life had arisen by about 3.8 billion years ago. I don't personally make any claims about how that happened. I don't know. I do think that it was by natural means, since there is no evidence of the magic that you claim as the cause. As I stated, life is evidence of life. Nothing more.\n \nAnd from this unprovable accident of mathematically impossible odds, you then claim that through a series of random mutations leading to a process coined by a term by proponents of this myth referred to as natural selection which teaches that each generation fights to survive with no concern for the other life forms which it shares space with. But you believe that from this chaotic struggle for improved life via evolution, that it is rationale that we ended up with this perfectly balanced and cooperating environment?\n\n Don't be stupid. I have watched hawks preying on doves in my back yard. How is it that you think that the dove cooperates with the hawk? As for any claims of mathematical impossibility, I wouldn't be so stupid. I leave that to creationists who seem to lack the intelligence to understand that after the fact calculations of probabilities are meaningless. Please explain to me about the concern that lions have for the animals that they eat.\n \nPleeaasse pandion,\n\n Pleeaasse! That's pandit pandion, to you. Or wise pandion, or learned pandion will do.\n \nyou embarrass yourself when you claim that what you believe in by faith is more rational than what we believe in by faith.\n\n But I don't \"believe\" in evolutionary biology \"by faith.\" My faith is something quite different from what you think it is. But it was a nice try in trying to reduce a body of scientific theory to the level of belief in magic. What you believe in by faith is nothing more that a belief in magic and the mythology of an old book.\n \nThe fact is that nothing you accept can be proven absolutely either. And it all relies on massive conclusions which are based on completely unprovable assumptions.\n\n Actually, what I accept isn't based on assumptions. I base it on lots of empirical evidence that I have studied for many years. But if you want to talk about unprovable assumptions, why don't you explain to us why any rational person should accept the idiocy of the mythology of bronze age nomadic herdsmen as true. How is that not an assumption?\n \nMy God is self evident in every atom and molecule which holds the matter and energy of this universe together.\n\n That's just ignorant. If your petty magic man were self evident then there wouldn't be any debate. Your god is mythological. No better and no worse than any other mythological god.\n \nAnd you will find one day that just because you were blind to that FACT, your lack of insight did nothing to nullify or negate His place as the Master Creator of all that exists in time and space. And that is as sure a guarantee as the blood Jesus shed for your sins on that historic and blessed day 2000 years ago. emoticon_xgood\n\n I would have been disappointed if you had not ended your ridiculous rant with the typical fundy threat. Disagree with you and burn in hell.\n \n Make an effort to learn so that you don't make yourself look so foolish.",

I asked this question in post #306, and have yet to get an answer from any of the 10;\n \nThere are seven links called \"evil Bible\", highlighted in red, all going to the same place, that attempt to debunk the Bible and promote atheism - about 30 more links there. Yet the site's mission statement only describes science, nothing about religion or atheism. Why the dishonesty?\n\n \n Their inability to answer it has caused them to vent their frustration upon you. My apologies. \n \n It's always interesting to see the constant join/separation, join/separation, join/separation, join/separation etc etc that goes on with science and atheism, and see all the same people flip-floping as they defend it both ways, according to the argument. \n \n \nI'm still intrigued as to how the existence of life is evidence that there is a god. \n\n \n It's not really evidence, it's more of an indicator. Many, probably most people (especially young people) aren't like you or me - they don't have a firm, unchangeable worldview. They're still forming their worldview, or in the case of younger children, aren't even thinking much about it yet. To them, science's increasing inability to address ORIGINS of life could be a big problem for the naturalist/atheist worldview. To them, that would be an increasing indicator that there is a God. \n \n \nThat's the problem. We're back to the,\"I don't know so god must have done it\", argument. Which brings me back to the, \"The more we understand, the less god has to do, so he must be getting really bored\", statement. \n\n \n It's no different than the atheist claim \"There can't be a God, so nature must have done it\" in spite of the increasing evidence that nature didn't do it. \n \n \nIncidentally, I have no problem with you believeing in god (it's rubbish, but it's your choice), so long as you don't rant and rave about how someone is doing wrong because your god, for which you have no real evidence, says so. And then insult me because I happen to have noticed that you have no evidence. But then, jazy, you're not the one (or more) who is guilty of that round here. \n\n \n As I have no problem with your being an atheist, so long as you don't rant and rave about how someone is doing wrong because what you believe to be the highest form of intellect (the scientific community) says so. And then insult me because I know that science is not the only source of knowledge. \n \n \nThat life exists is evidence that life exists, nothing more. \n\n \n Sorry, but there really is something more. It's evidence that it had to have originated in some way. \n \n \nIt is not evidence for your mythology based fantasy. \n\n \n Again, It's not evidence for my belief in the supernatural, a better word would be \"indication\". Atheists believe that they have an indication in abiogenesis. Their indication has no more scientific evidence than does my indication. And their indication has been losing scientific ground, as the simplest forms of life have been only recently found to be quite complex - as assumptions for conditions of the early earth to be favorable to naturalistic origins are not scientific. \n \n \nBut there is no evidence that it did not come about by natural processes. \n\n \n Yes there is - its mathematical chances of happening have been going down with recent scientific discoveries. Just because atheists dislike the subject of mathematical improbabiltiy, doesn't mean it's not reality. \n \n \nAnd, there is, in fact, evidence of natural processes that may have resulted in life. \n\n \n \"May have\" only in the dreams of atheists. Testable, repeatable, observable evidence remains at zero. \n \n \nJust because you don't understand it doesn't make it so. \n\n \n I understand it enough to know that it's not testable, repeatable, or observable. Just because atheists control science doesn't make atheism so. \n \n \n Quote:\n \nOriginally Posted by marc9000 \n Uh, yes. He is supernatural. Beyond the realm of science. \n\n \n \nThat's great! For a lot of years we have been hearing about \"creation science\" and how ID creationism is science because they offer scientific evidence of the truth of a myth, and now you finally agree with what scientists have been saying all along. \n\n \n You claim to be educated, but you're not showing sixth grade reading skills. Scientific creationism and ID do not study the existence, or origin of God, they study the results of his work in nature. But you already knew that, really. You put forward what the scientific community constantly puts forward, to try to quickly and emotionally indoctrinate/brainwash students and the public, and end the discussion. \n \n \nYour petty little god is not a subject for science because your god is not natural. Science offers natural explanations for natural events. Nice going.\n\n \n And if it can't find a natural explanation, it leaves it blank, and yet declares that nature had to have done it some way. \n \n \nPerhaps if you made an effort to learn what science is and how it works you wouldn't make yourself look like such a fool by demanding \"proof.\" Science doesn't offer proof. \n\n \n Then why does the scientific community constantly demand \"proof\" from religion, or the study of ID? \n \n \nIt offers natural explanations of observations of natural phenomena. \n\n \n As religion offers explanations of observations of history and behavior of man. There is more to reality than science. ID offers explanations of observations of design characteristics in nature. Is there a scientific explanation why these two things cause some atheists to go completely ballistic? \n \n \nThe religious claptrap of the chain of being from primitive to advanced was rejected hundreds of years ago, with the development of real, empirical science. \n\n \n So science is atheistic..... today? Tomorrow, science and atheism won't know A THING about each other's existence? \n \n \nHowever, there is fossil evidence that life had arisen by about 3.8 billion years ago. I don't personally make any claims about how that happened. I don't know. \n\n \n Because you don't have any evidence? Was there evidence \"hundreds of years ago\", when dirty hay generated mice, or rotting meat generated maggots? \n \n \nafter the fact calculations of probabilities are meaningless. \n\n \n LETS HEAR IT FROM THE OTHER NINE! I want to explore just how dismissive the atheist mind really is concerning realities other than \"science\".",

He even fallaciously argues that we should abandon the benefits of modern science since we both recognize and reject this false science of evolution. People like you erroneously like to imply that because we reject the lie and fraud which evolution represents that we are anti-science. This is because you are extremists with no balanced insights at all. Here's my COMPLETE post which you quoted just part of, once again for clarification, just to show the objective observer how irrational your criticisms are as you bluster while making no correct or well thought out point at all.\n [Archangel] I'm here for the same reason everyone else is.

And you hate me because I have single handedly opposed each and every one of you since arriving here. \n \n I have punched more holes in your shallow and empty world views than can be found in a window screen. Your so called theory of evolution is a sham which you can't defend with one iota of absolute scientifically tested and repeatable evidence. You rely on the so called evidence of flawed men who come to conclusions which can't be verified in any real way at all, yet they combine various so called observation, add them together and claim these prove that certain things occurred in certain orders multiple billions of years ago.\n \n Never realizing or admitting to themselves that if even one equation is off by one decimal point the impact that has on all of the combined theories renders them useless as originally intended. And that's just one decimal point for one theory. What if multiple decimal points are off by only that much? And I'm telling you they are.

Well you will see one day what I knew, and you will learn that all of the people you clung to as allies lied to you and deceived you with their man made philosophies which agreed with you, while this christian whom you detest was the guy who showed you true love and respect because he dared to tell you the real truth which mattered in spite of the unending barrage of insults you spewed non stop at him.

   "after the fact calculations of probabilities are meaningless.\n\n LETS HEAR IT FROM THE OTHER NINE! I want to explore just how dismissive the atheist mind really is concerning realities other than \"science\".\nNot sure if I count as one of 'the other nine'*, but here goes nothing...\n \n Take a fair coin. Toss it 10 times. The probability that you will get that precise pattern of heads and tails is 1 in 2^10, or just under a 0.1% chance. However, that doesn't mean that the fact you got that incredibly unlikely pattern in a single set of tosses is not an 'indication that God exists'.\n \n Another example, and one that demonstrates one of the most common misunderstandings about 'unlikely events': Get 23 people in a room together. There is a greater than 50% chance that two of those people will share the same birthday, despite the fact that there are many more days in a year than people in the room. Increase that number up to 57 people - less than a sixth of the number of days in a year! - and the probability shoots up to over 99%. Again, the fact that two of them share a birthday would not indicate divine providence.\n \n There are a great many such examples I could have used, from the fact that someone wins the UK lottery most weeks (at odds of 14 million to one) to the fact that you exist, with your precise genetic code (at incalculable but astronomic odds, given the mixing of your parents DNA, all the factors that led your parents to meet each other etc, plus their parents and their parents and so on). The facts remain - firstly, 'statistically impossible' events happen all the time, because if they hadn't happened that particular way, they would have happened a slightly different way instead, as per the coin toss/your genes example. See my Pratchett quote, below. \n Secondly, lots of trials make even vanishing possibilities of a single event much, much more likely, as per the lottery/birthday problem example\n \n One final example of probability abuse would be refuted by snowflakes. Snowflakes are created by water molecules locking in place as the water transits from liquid to solid, as I'm sure you know (with a few extra complications). If you approach snowflake formation in the same manner that I have seen most ID arguments approach probability (for example, that of amino acids forming) then you would assume that molecules can form at any angle to each other and in any pattern, calculate the probability that all the water in a snowflake had frozen in that precise geometric pattern and conclude that all snowflakes must be Intelligently Designed. However, this simply isn't the case - not only are there lots of snowflakes, but the laws governing crystalline water result in beauty. That's not God - it's described by physics, not theology.\n \n I'll leave you with the words of Terry Pratchett, discussing the natural state of intelligent life.\n \n[A viewer from another world looks down at prehistoric Earth]\n The ice age was clearing up. He wondered what was happening down there, what gastropod or mammal or lizard was even now winding up it's elastic ready to propel itself towards the crown of the world.\n Soon, without a doubt, some creature would develop an unnecessarily large brain and be forced to do things with it. And it'd look around and probably declare how marvellous it was that the universe had been built to bring forward the inevitable development of creature-kind.\n Boy, was it in for a shock...\n\n \n (Rant demoted to footnote status)\n \n *which, incidentally, you are getting close to by making blanket statements about 'the atheist mind'. Oh, and ignoring the fact that Archie has ignore the only actual refutation to his arguments (mine, post #323 and #325), instead focusing only on the flak. And claiming that you asking a newbie why he's spamming an anti-christian website is something that everyone who disagrees with you should be concerned with.",

It is actually outlawed and condemned in the bible. Here's what I mean for your edification, although I'm sure it's a waste of bandwidth.\n \n Those who follow the path of the magic arts are on the wrong path - a road that leads away from God, not toward Him. In one way or another, the end will be disaster. The evil Queen Jezebel practiced witchcraft (2 Kings 9:22) bringing catastrophe on herself and all Israel. Over and over, God denounces those who \"conjure spells\" (NKJV) and those who practice witchcraft and sorcery. The Bible says that anyone who does these things is detestable to the Lord (Deuteronomy 18:10-12; 2 Kings 21:6; Micah 5:12; Isaiah 47:12; Ezekiel 13:18, 20; Acts 8:11-24; Leviticus 20:27; Exodus 7:11; Revelation 9:21; 22:15).\n \n God warns of the ultimate punishment. Revelation 21:8 says of \"...those who practice magic arts ...their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur... the second death\" (NIV). Those who practice witchcraft (sorcery) will not inherit the kingdom of God (Galatians 5:20-21). \n \n So like pandion and others around here, you throw labels around based on a complete ignorance of what I and other believers in Messiah actually believe in. \n \n \nGet a life loser, you have done nothing that brings evolution into question. The simplistic by the numbers rhetoric you spout has no effect on scientific progress and you will continue to benefit from the work science provides you despite your derision of it - like I said you are a coward and a hypocrite.\n\n \n Yet none of you have posted absolutely any evidence at all refuting my arguments. If I am so ignorant then why is it that all you guys have are these insulting rants against me while producing none of that scientific evidence you claim is so overwhelming.

And since neither of us can absolutely prove our belief systems to a scientific certainty, how ignorant are you to just dismiss my beliefs when at least my source claims to be, and is believed to be all seeing and an eternally existing being who created all that is in time and space? You trust the creature over the creator and call me stupid? emoticon_frazzled \n \n Let's face it my lost and spiritually dead children, humanities science can't even predict next weeks weather with 100% certainty even though we have placed Doppler satellites in geosynchronous orbit to feed us moment by moment intel in real time. Nor can we look back at last weeks weather and explain why it occurred as it did given that same detailed intel, and the 20/20 hindsight which goes along with interpreting it. Yet you want me to believe that your so called evolutionary sciences imaginings regarding the mythical goings on what took place some theoretical 14.5 billion years ago regarding the big bang is founded in actual supportable scientific fact? And you are calling me stupid? emoticon_emb in case you can't interpret the emoticon, it is saying I'm embarrassed for you. \n \n Now be sure to ignore all that I have said here which are valid and simple arguments which question your flawed and self deceptive world view, and just post another ignorant diatribe of invective and insults toward someone you don't know in the most basic way, yet you excoriate me, as if you do. emoticon_xgood After all, the objective observers will see very clearly which of us is coming from a rational and real world perspective in a common sense approach to the unanswerable questions which every human being must contend with in his or her journey through life. Me, with my arguments as posted above, and you, with your irrational and hate filled insults which contribute absolutely nothing to the debate about the big bang or evolution. emoticon_xdonno",

   "These mooks are legends in their own minds marc. Yet in spite of their sanctimonious arrogance I actually feel sorry for them because of the massive fall which awaits them when the reality of their spiritual condition hits home on that final day. \n\n \n I agree of course, but there's hope for them, the confidence is at least partially a fa\u00e7ade, posts like 345/347 are clear indicators of that. Most of them are obviously very young - they have plenty of time to live in the real world and see how much more there is to it than just their recent science class indoctrination. \n \n \n [to promethean] Hmm, you sound remarkably like another very obvious child who lurks around here hiding behind various personas \n\n \n No question that's who it is, multiple user names is another obvious indication of a lack of confidence. \n \n \n \nNot sure if I count as one of 'the other nine'*, but here goes nothing...\n \n Take a fair coin. Toss it 10 times. The probability that you will get that precise pattern of heads and tails is 1 in 2^10, or just under a 0.1% chance. However, that doesn't mean that the fact you got that incredibly unlikely pattern in a single set of tosses is not an 'indication that God exists'.\n \n Another example, and one that demonstrates one of the most common misunderstandings about 'unlikely events': Get 23 people in a room together. There is a greater than 50% chance that two of those people will share the same birthday, despite the fact that there are many more days in a year than people in the room. Increase that number up to 57 people - less than a sixth of the number of days in a year! - and the probability shoots up to over 99%. Again, the fact that two of them share a birthday would not indicate divine providence.\n \n There are a great many such examples I could have used, from the fact that someone wins the UK lottery most weeks (at odds of 14 million to one) to the fact that you exist, with your precise genetic code (at incalculable but astronomic odds, given the mixing of your parents DNA, all the factors that led your parents to meet each other etc, plus their parents and their parents and so on). The facts remain - firstly, 'statistically impossible' events happen all the time, because if they hadn't happened that particular way, they would have happened a slightly different way instead, as per the coin toss/your genes example. See my Pratchett quote, below. \n Secondly, lots of trials make even vanishing possibilities of a single event much, much more likely, as per the lottery/birthday problem example\n \n One final example of probability abuse would be refuted by snowflakes. Snowflakes are created by water molecules locking in place as the water transits from liquid to solid, as I'm sure you know (with a few extra complications). If you approach snowflake formation in the same manner that I have seen most ID arguments approach probability (for example, that of amino acids forming) then you would assume that molecules can form at any angle to each other and in any pattern, calculate the probability that all the water in a snowflake had frozen in that precise geometric pattern and conclude that all snowflakes must be Intelligently Designed. However, this simply isn't the case - not only are there lots of snowflakes, but the laws governing crystalline water result in beauty. That's not God - it's described by physics, not theology. \n\n \n Yet not all physicists are convinced. To dismiss something, you would need uncontroversial evidence that everyone would agree on. Comparing the complexities of biology and all its associated orderly, fragile systems with things like coin tosses and daily probablilties of 365 day years is not convincing to many people, it's not really even logical. As the final paragraph of the final review of Lee Spetner's book remarks;\n \n \nDiehard evolutionists usually react to serious challenges to their cherished theory in two ways: ad hominem attacks on the challenger, and the hand-waving technique. However, intellectual integrity requires them to provide a detailed and rigorous scientific response to those challenges. \n\n \n Ad hominem - hand waving? We sure see plenty of both in this thread, don't we? The hand-waving of the calculations of probabilities, (as Pandion did that you're defending) no matter what new advances in biology have been made since Darwin, is not the open inquiry that science should be. \n \n \nI'll leave you with the words of Terry Pratchett, discussing the natural state of intelligent life. \n\n \n \n Originally Posted by Terry Pratchett, Science of Discworld\n [A viewer from another world looks down at prehistoric Earth]\n The ice age was clearing up. He wondered what was happening down there, what gastropod or mammal or lizard was even now winding up it's elastic ready to propel itself towards the crown of the world.\n Soon, without a doubt, some creature would develop an unnecessarily large brain and be forced to do things with it. And it'd look around and probably declare how marvellous it was that the universe had been built to bring forward the inevitable development of creature-kind.\n Boy, was it in for a shock...\n\n \n Is this how far 'science' has deteriorated? Is this taught to students in science classes? \n \n \n \n \nwhich, incidentally, you are getting close to by making blanket statements about 'the atheist mind'. \n \n \n Blanket statements fit the behavior of most atheist minds here - this thread shows it very well. \n \n \nOh, and ignoring the fact that Archie has ignore the only actual refutation to his arguments (mine, post #323 and #325), instead focusing only on the flak. \n\n \n So it's HIS fault, and not those who have been pouring on the flak? Do you think there's a chance that they have been pouring on the flak for that very reason? Why don't you tell them to shut up so he can focus on what you said? Do you enjoy their flak? What do you think its purpose is? To shout down, or promote open inquiry? \n \n \n \n And claiming that you asking a newbie why he's spamming an anti-christian website is something that everyone who disagrees with you should be concerned with.[/size]\n\n \n Since I've constantly seen the claim by most in this thread/these forums that evolution/science is not atheistic, logic says they should be concerned with it! emoticon_idea",

   "COBE and WMAP for two.\n\n \n Really? This is absolute evidence which can only be interpreted one way? by that I mean the way it has been interpreted? Because the interpreters of this evidence don't make such an absolute claim, although they do show excitement in the possibilities that it pegs the age of the universe @ 13.7 billion years with only a 1% margin of error. Here is what the Nasa Link says:\n The WMAP team found that the Big Bang and Inflation theories continue to ring true. The contents of the Universe include 4% atoms (ordinary matter), 23% of an unknown type of dark matter, and 73% of a mysterious dark energy. The new measurements even shed light on the nature of the dark energy, which acts as a sort of an anti-gravity.NASA - Top Story - NEW IMAGE OF INFANT UNIVERSE REVEALS ERA OF FIRST STARS, AGE OF COSMOS, AND MORE - Feb. 11, 2003\n \n So, what do we actually have here? Although they speak in very confident tones, we see here in the bolded that the prior theories of the Big Bang and Inflation continue to ring true, but even Nasa doesn't speak in absolute terms at all. Ringing true is in no way an absolute statement of undeniable fact, especially since fully 96% of the energy in the Universe is an unknown type of dark matter, or a mysterious dark energy. Also, they observe that the new measurements even shed light on the nature of the dark energy, which acts as a sort of an anti-gravity, is it realistic to make interpretations and conclusions based on such preliminary observations which haven't even been confirmed absolutely yet? So the question must be asked, is it impossible to answer affirmatively in absolute terms how reliable these interpretations are regarding the age of the universe or the Big Bang event itself. \n \n They openly admit that these conclusions are based on predictions other unnamed cosmic theories make, so there is absolutely nothing absolute about this evidence at all. It is all based on interpretation which I maintain is impossible to do without all of the information which is impossible to gather because we don't really know what questions to ask at this point from our distant perspective in both time and space from the actual event. Science is grasping at straws so to speak, which I respect and encourage. I respect the work cosmology is doing as a legitimate science, my only problem is the hubris involved in making assumptions that we are anywhere close to understanding the full picture required to fully and accurately assess first how the universe came into being and then, the age of it. \n \n As I have said before to the consternation of the humanist opposition and in fulfillment of TQs prediction, ;) a misreading of this evidence and sciences preconceived belief in a universe that is billions of years old could mean that our universe is not billions of years old at all, but could be only thousands of years old. And I'm making no absolute statement of fact in that regard either, all I'm saying is that the possibility exists and nothing science has come up with is absolute evidence of anything concrete which you are placing an equal amount of faith in. Evolution and the science surrounding it is as much a religion to you as my belief and faith in my God is to me. \n \n After all, the article goes on to say this:\n Theories about the evolution of the Universe make specific predictions about the extent of these temperature patterns. Like a detective, the WMAP team compared the unique \"fingerprint\" of patterns imprinted on this ancient light with fingerprints predicted by various cosmic theories and found a match.\n I must ask another question here, what if the so called ancient light is not really so ancient? What if they never assumed the light to be ancient? How then would the predicted fingerprint match by these various cosmic theories then be interpreted? And what would that conclusion be? \n \n So let me be clear, to steal a cliche from our president, :) I don't question the observations we are making via the technological discoveries we are learning from, but I understand very well that interpretation is everything and even the scientists involved in these discoveries don't speak in nearly the absolute terms that you layman defenders of these observations do. So nice try, but this evidence doesn't meet the standards which I requested from iangb by any measure of an absolute result.\n \n \n Now it's your turn to post undeniable evidence that the events in the Bible happened as the Bible (and you) claim they did. So far, all you have given us is your superstitious belief in mythology.\n\n \n When did I claim that I have undeniable scientific evidence that the Genesis account is provable pandion? Haven't I said here and elsewhere in debate that we both rely on faith in believing our preferred world views? It's just that my faith is in an eternal, all knowing Creator God who claims to have personally spoken this world into creation along with humanity whom He created in His image. And all of the proceeding reality such as Mans dominion over all life on earth and our superiority over that life remains true to this day. \n \n You secular humanists on the other hand rely on the very flawed observations of fallen men and their interpretations of cosmic events which we are in no position to discern since admittedly 96% of the content of the universe is made up of undefinable and as of yet indiscernible Dark Matter or Dark Energy. So what incredible hubris is required to place your faith in such unknowable conclusions which are based in such unprovable assumptions?\n \n PS, my automatic spell checker automatically corrects your name pandion to pandit every time I write it out. So I didn't misspell your name on purpose, I failed to catch its change by the computer and correct it. Just so you know. emoticon_xgood",

Explain the history of meteor impacts, vulcanism, and tectonic events that we can all see-keeping in mind that the energy released in all these events would boil the oceans away and turn the earth molten if condensed into the time period you insist is fact (based on a XXXXing book of myths). While you're at it, explain how meteor craters are found in geological layers that you insist we're laid down by the flood. \n \n Just so we're all clear here, for your claim to be correct, there would have to be the flood, numerous meteors fall on the (presumably) still mobile sediments, which somehow solidify just before the meteor strikes (otherwise it wouldn't produce the characteristic crater pattern), then the brand spanking new crater is weathered to make it appear that millions of years of erosion takes place, while new sediments cover it up and also solidify (repeat a few times, otherwise we can't explain multiple impacts in similar locations), all in the span of 40 days. \n \n I guess I'll add a couple more questions-how do sediments instantaneously become rock? And why just the section where the meteor struck? Can sediments sense an incoming meteor, and while some sediment dodges, the rest solidifies to \"catch\" the meteor? Then the \"dodgy\" sediment comes back, quickly erodes the suddenly solid portions, and covers them up and itself solidifies, all in a manner that we'd expect to see on a 4.5 billion year old planet?\n \n Explain folded rock layers and how they could be produced in sudden, cataclysmic events. \n \n Explain varves, and ice cores, and how even though the have every appearance of being laid down annually over millenia (preserving annual pollen and spore samples, just as we'd expect), they were actually laid down in 40 days a few thousand years ago.\n \n Explain how the flood (and a biblical age of the earth) accounts for all that, and more, better than the theory that everyone with two brain cells to rub together accepts.\n \n Or, be the ignorant coward and XXXXX we all know you to be, and ignore the questions I asked and insult me.

Accipiter has already given the reason we don't see as many craters on earth as other bodies in the solar system. But I'll just talk about the confirmed craters as pointed out on your map, and we can compare those to Mt. St. Helens.\n \n The Mt. St. Helens eruption was the equivalent of a 24 megaton bomb going off. For reference purposes, the largest atomic bomb ever tested was a 25 megaton hydrogen bomb, and the Hiroshima bomb was a 0.01 megaton bomb.\n \n Now, if we take Isaac Newton's formula for kinetic energy (E = 1/2mv^2), we can calculate the amount of energy needed to create all those craters on your map. The result: over one billion megatons of energy.\n \n That would be the same as 40 million Mt. Saint Helens eruptions! \n \n Over a 5,000 year YEC period, that would be the equivalent of twenty 25 megaton bombs exploding every single day! It would be the equivalent of 23 Mount St. Helens eruptions every single day!\n \n Of course, even young earth creationists don't believe that such catastrophic events have been happening for the past 3,000 years at least, and most young earth creationist literature I've read attributes the above meteor impacts to a single \"flood year\". That would mean that during the \"flood year\" there was the equivalent of 40 million Mount St. Helens eruptions on the earth.\n \n If the earth is only thousands of years old, then those meteor impacts should have obliterated the surface of the earth and generated sufficient heat to boil away the oceans. Or the basic physics of Isaac Newton are another aspect of science that young earth creationism rejects. Or those meteor impacts never really happened.\n \n If the earth is at least several hundreds of millions of years old, then the above meteor impacts present no problem as evidence of a history of events.",

I know that the observable evidence can't only be interpreted 2 ways but any combination and number of ways. \n \n PS.

However, geological data shows that the magnetic field goes through periods of reversal, and we are currently entering a time that it might flip over within a thousand years or so. The magnetic field would get weaker, reverse, then get stronger again. This has been mathematically modeled , and the model actually predicted some of the anomalies we are seeing.\n \n \n\n \n \n 2. The earth's rotation is slowing down, that's a fact and is measurable. Although it doesn't prove God created earth it does put a date on how long life has been on earth. Some where around the 250,000 year point the earth's rotation would have been to fast to support life.\n \n\n CE011: Earth's rotation slowing\n \n The earth's rotation is slowing at a rate of about 0.005 seconds per year per year. This extrapolates to the earth having a fourteen-hour day 4.6 billion years ago, which is entirely possible.\n \n The rate at which the earth is slowing today is higher than average because the present rate of spin is in resonance with the back-and-forth movement of the oceans.\n \n Fossil rugose corals preserve daily and yearly growth patterns and show that the day was about 22 hours long 370 million years ago, in rough agreement with the 22.7 hours predicted from a constant rate of slowing (Scrutton 1964; Wells 1963). \n \n\n \n 3. The moon is leaving the earth, that's a fact and is measurable. Although it doesn't prove God created earth it does put a date on how long life has been on earth. Some where around the 250,000 year point the gravitation effects from the moon would have been too strong to support life.\n\n CE110: Moon Receding\n \n # The moon is receding at about 3.8 cm per year. Since the moon is 3.85 \u00d7 1010 cm from the earth, this is already consistent, within an order of magnitude, with an earth-moon system billions of years old.\n \n # The magnitude of tidal friction depends on the arrangement of the continents. In the past, the continents were arranged such that tidal friction, and thus the rates of earth's slowing and the moon's recession, would have been less. The earth's rotation has slowed at a rate of two seconds every 100,000 years (Eicher 1976).\n \n # The rate of earth's rotation in the distant past can be measured. Corals produce skeletons with both daily layers and yearly patterns, so we can count the number of days per year when the coral grew. Measurements of fossil corals from 180 to 400 million years ago show year lengths from 381 to 410 days, with older corals showing more days per year (Eicher 1976; Scrutton 1970; Wells 1963; 1970). Similarly, days per year can also be computed from growth patterns in mollusks (Pannella 1976; Scrutton 1978) and stromatolites (Mohr 1975; Pannella et al. 1968) and from sediment deposition patterns (Williams 1997). All such measurements are consistent with a gradual rate of earth's slowing for the last 650 million years.\n \n # The clocks based on the slowing of earth's rotation described above provide an independent method of dating geological layers over most of the fossil record. The data is inconsistent with a young earth",

This is from a left wing web site.\n \n Impossible Stuff Found In Coal and Rock\n \n By James Donahue\n \n It is said that coal is a by-product of decaying vegetation and that it takes from 30 to 300 million years for its natural production. Thus when \"impossible\" items like jewelry, a spoon, a metallic cube and other \"man-made\" objects are found in lumps of coal, we are inclined to perceive human history in a dramatically new light.\n \n There is a growing list of these items that made the news in their day, but then were put aside as unexplainable anomalies.

There are many hard-line fundamentalists who would like to sweep such things under the rug so they don't confuse their archaic belief systems.\n \n Nevertheless, these things exist. We offer a list of the ones we presently know about. We are sure there are many others.\n \n The Morrisonville, Illinois Times, on June 11, 1891, said Mrs. S. W. Culp found a circular shaped eight-carat gold chain, about 10 inches long, embedded in a lump of coal after she broke it apart to put in her scuttle. The chain was described as \"antique\" and of \"quaint workmanship.\" The story said only part of the chain was revealed when she first broke open the coal, and that the rest of the chain remained buried within the coal. The coal came from one of the southern Illinois mines.\n \n Yet another story found in Epoch Times told of a Colorado rancher who in the 1800s broke open a lump of coal, dug from a vein some 300 feet in the earth, and found a \"strange-looking iron thimble.\" The item was dubbed the \"Thimble of Eve\" by the media. Since its discovery, however, and due to mishandling by its owners, the iron corroded and disintegrated.\n \n In 1944, when he was a boy of 10, Newton Anderson dropped a lump of coal in the basement of his home in Upshur County West Virginia. The coal, which had been mined near his home, broke open and out fell a brass bell with a long artistic handle with what is described as a \"demon-like\" figure at the end. An iron clapper was still attached within the bell. The bell has been featured in a 1992 CBS documentary titled \"Ancient Secrets of the Bible.\" The bell now belongs to a Genesis Park collection, which we believe may be in New Hampshire. .\n \n Within the Creation Evidence Museum at Glen Rose, Texas, can be found a cast iron pot reportedly found in a large lump of coal in 1912 by a worker feeding coal into a local electric power plant. When he split open the coal the worker said the pot fell out, leaving its impression in the coal. The coal had been mined at Wilburton, Oklahoma. The bell and pot are being used by Christians to prove the Genesis story of Tubal Cain, who reportedly forged metals prior to the flood.\n \n A large ceramic spoon or ladle was found in the ashes of a coal stove by a woman in Pennsylvania in 1937. The item was sent to The Smithsonian Institute for examination, and remained buried in the volumes of artifacts stored there until its existence was made public in 1976.\n \n The Salzburg Cube is yet another ancient puzzle found by a worker named Reidl in an Austrian foundry in 1885. Like the others, this man broke open a block of coal and found a metal cube embedded inside. The mining engineer wrote off the item as a meteorite, but more recent analysis shows that the object was a forged iron and obviously hand crafted. The item is not perfectly square, with slightly rounded sides on two ends. It measures only two and a half by one and four-fifth of an inch. There is an incision that runs around it horizontally, suggesting it may have been a machine part.\n \n Workers in stone quarries also have found impossible objects. \n \n It is said that in 1844, quarry workers at Rutherford Mills, England, found a piece of gold thread embedded in rock about eight feet in the ground.\n \n The London Times in 1851 reported that Hiram DeWitt, of Springfield, Mass, brought a piece of quartz home from a trip to California. When the stone was accidentally dropped it split open and inside was a cut-iron six-penny nail. The nail was described as perfectly straight and with its head still intact.\n \n A British publication of 1845-51 contained a report by Sir David Brewster that a nail was found in a block of stone from the Kingoodie Quarry, North Britain. The head of the nail was exposed but an inch of it was embedded in the stone.\n \n The oxidized remains of a tapered, threaded iron screw was found in a piece of feldspar removed from a mine near Treasure City, Nevada, in 1869.\n \n Then there was a \"mystery object of exquisite workmanship\" found by workers in solid pudding stone, about 15 feet in the ground, at Dorchester, Mass. A story in the June, 1851 edition of Scientific American said the artifact was a \"bell-shaped vessel\" four and a half inches high, six and a half inches wide at the base, and two and a half inches wide at the top.

   "First let me say I am no expert or scientist and do not claim to be one. Second, I agree that my believing God created the earth 6,000 years ago is based on faith. However, I have yet seen any scientific eviendence to prove against it, but I think there is some serious mental hoops to jump through if you believe earth is billions of years old, and life have evolved over a billion years or so.\n \n \n <CD410: Airplanes Buried in Ice<\n \n When it is convenient the layers are annual, when not they are many layers per season. I agree with the points on the web page, I also say if ice core samples would have been taken it would have shown a much long time period.\n \n You didn't directly address my point. As late as a few thousand years ago Greenland and possibly the Antarctic were ice free. How do you determine the ice cores are hundred of thousands years old let alone millions.\n \n <You are assuming that it was at a single level, and kept on getting weaker. However, geological data shows that the magnetic field goes through periods of reversal, and we are currently entering a time that it might flip over within a thousand years or so. The magnetic field would get weaker, reverse, then get stronger again. This has been mathematically modeled , and the model actually predicted some of the anomalies we are seeing.<\n \n I think there are some serious problems with reversal of the magnetic field and is more likely the result of water rushing in and cooling the rocks which would cause a differential in magnetic strength. But even if I give you this, you still have a problem.\n \n \"The last reversal was the Brunhes-Matuyama reversal approximately 780,000 years ago.\" That does not solve the issue; approximately 25,000 years ago (I'll give you 50,000 years or even 100,000) the earth's magnetic field was so strong that it would kill all living life on earth.\n \n CE011: Earth's rotation slowing\n \n <The earth's rotation is slowing at a rate of about 0.005 seconds per year. This extrapolates to the earth having a fourteen-hour day 4.6 billion years ago, which is entirely possible.\n \n The rate at which the earth is slowing today is higher than average because the present rate of spin is in resonance with the back-and-forth movement of the oceans.\n \n Fossil rugose corals preserve daily and yearly growth patterns and show that the day was about 22 hours long 370 million years ago, in rough agreement with the 22.7 hours predicted from a constant rate of slowing (Scrutton 1964; Wells 1963).<\n \n It is closer to .0002 per day, that makes a quite a difference per year and puts a limit on life on earth. \n \n \"Leap seconds are added to keep the atomic clocks synchronized with the Earth's rotation. This is because the Earth rotates at a slower pace over time while the atomic clocks do not slow down. The Earth is rotating slower and slower over time, while the atomic clocks are not slowing down. On one average day the difference between atomic clocks and Earth's rotation is around 0.002 seconds, or around 1 second every 1.5 years. \n The time to do one rotation differs from day to day and from year to year. The Earth was slower than atomic clocks by: 0.16 seconds in 2005; 0.30 seconds in 2006; 0.31 seconds in 2007; and 0.32 seconds in 2008. It was only 0.02 seconds slower in 2001 (based on data from IERS).\"\n \n \n <CE110: Moon Receding\n \n # The moon is receding at about 3.8 cm per year. Since the moon is 3.85 \u00d7 1010 cm from the earth, this is already consistent, within an order of magnitude, with an earth-moon system billions of years old.\n \n # The magnitude of tidal friction depends on the arrangement of the continents. In the past, the continents were arranged such that tidal friction, and thus the rates of earth's slowing and the moon's recession, would have been less. The earth's rotation has slowed at a rate of two seconds every 100,000 years (Eicher 1976).\n \n # The rate of earth's rotation in the distant past can be measured. Corals produce skeletons with both daily layers and yearly patterns, so we can count the number of days per year when the coral grew. Measurements of fossil corals from 180 to 400 million years ago show year lengths from 381 to 410 days, with older corals showing more days per year (Eicher 1976; Scrutton 1970; Wells 1963; 1970). Similarly, days per year can also be computed from growth patterns in mollusks (Pannella 1976; Scrutton 1978) and stromatolites (Mohr 1975; Pannella et al. 1968) and from sediment deposition patterns (Williams 1997). All such measurements are consistent with a gradual rate of earth's slowing for the last 650 million years.\n \n # The clocks based on the slowing of earth's rotation described above provide an independent method of dating geological layers over most of the fossil record. The data is inconsistent with a young earth<\n \n I don't understand the rational, it is receding at 3.8 cm per year (I'll take your word for it) however that is not constant, it is based on the Inverse Square law: \n \n Inverse Square Law, General\n Any point source which spreads its influence equally in all directions without a limit to its range will obey the inverse square law. This comes from strictly geometrical considerations. The intensity of the influence at any given radius r is the source strength divided by the area of the sphere. Being strictly geometric in its origin, the inverse square law applies to diverse phenomena. Point sources of gravitational force, electric field, light, sound or radiation obey the inverse square law. It is a subject of continuing debate with a source such as a skunk on top of a flag pole; will it's smell drop off according to the inverse square law? \n \n Gravity : Inverse Square Law, Gravity\n As one of the fields which obey the general inverse square law, the gravity field can be put in the form shown below, showing that the acceleration of gravity, g, is an expression of the intensity of the gravity field.",

   "Are you telling me that Greenland's ice content is the same as it was during the Holocene period? Then tell me how do you explain the rise in sea levels that we know occured?\n\n Not exactly. The glaciers have been retreating for a long time. When I spent a year in northern Greenland in the mid 60s, the land from the base to the ice cap was a series of moraines that marked the advance and retreat of the ice cap over the past several thousand years. When I was there, the cap was in retreat. From the edge near the coast, the cap goes up and up. At its highest point the cap reaches an altitude of about 3.3 Km above sea level. When you consider that the interior of the land mass is well below sea level, that makes a lot of ice to have formed in about 4000 years (since the mythical FLUD). Back when I was there the researchers working on the cap had counted over 250,000 annual layers in the ice cores.\n \nThe debate isn't whether vocanic ash is located exactly in the layer it should be, it is when did that layer occur?\n\n You miss the point. We know when many, many volcanic eruptions took place. In the case of historic eruptions we know when right down to the day. Those eruptions have left ash-fall in the Greenland ice cap. The Vesuvius eruption that destroyed Pompeii is clearly visible, as is Krakatoa. Those layers are right where they are expected to be.",

   "I don't have time right now to answer everything but will get back to it later. By the way the leading evolutionists think there is a problem with items found in coal and rock as they developed a theory that ~\"under the right conditions and weather metal materials can pass through solid rock\" I don't remember who came up with the theory, but it had to be to address items in coal. This is from a left wing web site.\n \n Impossible Stuff Found In Coal and Rock\n \n By James Donahue\n \n It is said that coal is a by-product of decaying vegetation and that it takes from 30 to 300 million years for its natural production. Thus when \"impossible\" items like jewelry, a spoon, a metallic cube and other \"man-made\" objects are found in lumps of coal, we are inclined to perceive human history in a dramatically new light.\n \n There is a growing list of these items that made the news in their day, but then were put aside as unexplainable anomalies. When we put them all together, however, their existence challenges everything we thought we knew about the world and human history. There are many hard-line fundamentalists who would like to sweep such things under the rug so they don't confuse their archaic belief systems.\n \n Nevertheless, these things exist. We offer a list of the ones we presently know about. We are sure there are many others.\n \n The Morrisonville, Illinois Times, on June 11, 1891, said Mrs. S. W. Culp found a circular shaped eight-carat gold chain, about 10 inches long, embedded in a lump of coal after she broke it apart to put in her scuttle. The chain was described as \"antique\" and of \"quaint workmanship.\" The story said only part of the chain was revealed when she first broke open the coal, and that the rest of the chain remained buried within the coal. The coal came from one of the southern Illinois mines.\n \n Yet another story found in Epoch Times told of a Colorado rancher who in the 1800s broke open a lump of coal, dug from a vein some 300 feet in the earth, and found a \"strange-looking iron thimble.\" The item was dubbed the \"Thimble of Eve\" by the media. Since its discovery, however, and due to mishandling by its owners, the iron corroded and disintegrated.\n \n In 1944, when he was a boy of 10, Newton Anderson dropped a lump of coal in the basement of his home in Upshur County West Virginia. The coal, which had been mined near his home, broke open and out fell a brass bell with a long artistic handle with what is described as a \"demon-like\" figure at the end. An iron clapper was still attached within the bell. The bell has been featured in a 1992 CBS documentary titled \"Ancient Secrets of the Bible.\" The bell now belongs to a Genesis Park collection, which we believe may be in New Hampshire. .\n \n Within the Creation Evidence Museum at Glen Rose, Texas, can be found a cast iron pot reportedly found in a large lump of coal in 1912 by a worker feeding coal into a local electric power plant. When he split open the coal the worker said the pot fell out, leaving its impression in the coal. The coal had been mined at Wilburton, Oklahoma. The bell and pot are being used by Christians to prove the Genesis story of Tubal Cain, who reportedly forged metals prior to the flood.\n \n A large ceramic spoon or ladle was found in the ashes of a coal stove by a woman in Pennsylvania in 1937. The item was sent to The Smithsonian Institute for examination, and remained buried in the volumes of artifacts stored there until its existence was made public in 1976.\n \n The Salzburg Cube is yet another ancient puzzle found by a worker named Reidl in an Austrian foundry in 1885. Like the others, this man broke open a block of coal and found a metal cube embedded inside. The mining engineer wrote off the item as a meteorite, but more recent analysis shows that the object was a forged iron and obviously hand crafted. The item is not perfectly square, with slightly rounded sides on two ends. It measures only two and a half by one and four-fifth of an inch. There is an incision that runs around it horizontally, suggesting it may have been a machine part.\n \n Workers in stone quarries also have found impossible objects. \n \n It is said that in 1844, quarry workers at Rutherford Mills, England, found a piece of gold thread embedded in rock about eight feet in the ground.\n \n The London Times in 1851 reported that Hiram DeWitt, of Springfield, Mass, brought a piece of quartz home from a trip to California. When the stone was accidentally dropped it split open and inside was a cut-iron six-penny nail. The nail was described as perfectly straight and with its head still intact.\n \n A British publication of 1845-51 contained a report by Sir David Brewster that a nail was found in a block of stone from the Kingoodie Quarry, North Britain. The head of the nail was exposed but an inch of it was embedded in the stone.\n \n The oxidized remains of a tapered, threaded iron screw was found in a piece of feldspar removed from a mine near Treasure City, Nevada, in 1869.\n \n Then there was a \"mystery object of exquisite workmanship\" found by workers in solid pudding stone, about 15 feet in the ground, at Dorchester, Mass. A story in the June, 1851 edition of Scientific American said the artifact was a \"bell-shaped vessel\" four and a half inches high, six and a half inches wide at the base, and two and a half inches wide at the top. The sides are inlaid with images of flowers, fines or a wreath. The object appears to be a composition of metals, and inlaid with silver.\n\n \n Let's see you provide actual evidence that this happened. Claims are all well and good, but, well, in case you haven't noticed, people lie. \n \n And, creationists lie a hell of a lot.",

   "We can do a 'back of the envelope' calculation to get some ballpark numbers:\n \n I read somewhere that the plate tectonic movement occurred during the flood year. Let's say the average movement of the tectonic plates was equal to the distance from New York to Los Angeles, 2777 miles. This number is way low, but I'll use conservative numbers.\n \n So, 2777 miles is equal to 7.608 miles per day, and that converts to .1417 meters / second.\n \n The mass of the continental and oceanic crusts is roughly 2.83 X 10^23 kilograms.\n \n We know (from Isaac Newton) that kinetic energy is: E = 1/2 mv^2, and plugging the above numbers into the formula yields 2.8 X 10^21 joules of energy.\n \n Since the continents are (effectively) not moving at present, the above kinetic energy had to be dissipated as heat, and that much heat would pretty much boil the oceans. If we factor in magma, volcanoes, etc. the situation becomes more dire.\n \n So, the choices are:\n \n 1. Centuries old physics is completely out to lunch.\n 2. Rapid tectonics did not happen in the past several thousand years\n 3. The wealth of evidence indicating tectonic movement is really fake, created several thousand years ago.\n 4. The tectonic plates have been moving very slowly over many millions of years.\n\n \n Thanks for taking the time to post this Birdan.",

   "I don't deny that the earth has been hit by meteors or has experienced tectonic plate shifts and earthquakes as well as volcanoes throughout its history. But we haven't experienced meteor events on the scale of neighboring planets by any means. Why is that when we share the same spacial real estate, so to speak? \n Geographic Distribution of Known Impact Structures\n This image shows the geographic distribution of about 160 structures that have been positively identified to date as impact structures based on the presence of shock-metamorphic effects and/or the presence of a meteoritic component or fragments at the structure.\n http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/slidesets/craters/images/scraters_s02.jpg\n http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/slidesets/craters/images/02_DISTRIBUTION_MAP.JPG\n \n Compare this image to the number of craters on the moon which is our closest neighbor/satellite and the other planets in our neighborhood. Although I believe a big one is coming our way, we have dodged many bullets compared to the other planets around us. And remember, it isn't that these events occurred which I argue, it is when. Just look at Mt St Helens today and see how the destructive evidence of that event has been completely erased and grown over in a short 30 years, not 3,000, or 3 million years, but just 30 years.\n\n \n \nThanks for the reply. Accipiter has already given the reason we don't see as many craters on earth as other bodies in the solar system. But I'll just talk about the confirmed craters as pointed out on your map, and we can compare those to Mt. St. Helens.\n \n The Mt. St. Helens eruption was the equivalent of a 24 megaton bomb going off. For reference purposes, the largest atomic bomb ever tested was a 25 megaton hydrogen bomb, and the Hiroshima bomb was a 0.01 megaton bomb.\n \n Now, if we take Isaac Newton's formula for kinetic energy (E = 1/2mv^2), we can calculate the amount of energy needed to create all those craters on your map. The result: over one billion megatons of energy.\n \n That would be the same as 40 million Mt. Saint Helens eruptions! \n \n Over a 5,000 year YEC period, that would be the equivalent of twenty 25 megaton bombs exploding every single day! It would be the equivalent of 23 Mount St. Helens eruptions every single day!\n \n Of course, even young earth creationists don't believe that such catastrophic events have been happening for the past 3,000 years at least, and most young earth creationist literature I've read attributes the above meteor impacts to a single \"flood year\". That would mean that during the \"flood year\" there was the equivalent of 40 million Mount St. Helens eruptions on the earth.\n \n If the earth is only thousands of years old, then those meteor impacts should have obliterated the surface of the earth and generated sufficient heat to boil away the oceans. Or the basic physics of Isaac Newton are another aspect of science that young earth creationism rejects. Or those meteor impacts never really happened.\n \n If the earth is at least several hundreds of millions of years old, then the above meteor impacts present no problem as evidence of a history of events.\n\n \n \n \n I take it this discussion is over?",
