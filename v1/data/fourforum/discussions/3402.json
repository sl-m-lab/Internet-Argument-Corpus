But I'll say you shouldn't worry about what the religion is of people you hang out with, as long as you don't talk about religion (and I don't know about you, but that's not what I talk about when hanging out with friends). I know what religion other people have, but they respect my beliefs and I respect theirs. And I'll reiterate this is about a debate, which is a discussion about ideas not just a statement against one person.",
