Do you mean make interpretation as in make up a new meanign for the 4th amendment, or 14th amendment, etc? To me, it is not hard to see how abortion is not in the constitution. It was never there before 1973 and it certainly isn't there now. If you take the idea of the living constitution and substantive due process then you are just saying \"the judges get to determine what liberty you have and what amendments should say\". Kelo thought public use means public good...but why? There was no reason to think this other than their own personal bias. These \"tough\" decisions you speak of are not so tough if you just use a consistent view of the constitution that uses the peoples adoptiond and not the views of 9 people. We could go through the process but in the end, you will have to support Sigma when she says that something could be constitutional today and yet not tomorrow and vise versa. \n \n Ok, that being said, this case has to look at the 4th amendment to determine what happens if someone says you can \"search\" and the other one says you can't (they both own the property). The number of people is actually irrelevant in this case so don't look at it like a 50/50 thing...you could have 4 people for and 1 against. The reason consent is enough to enter a home is that this is considered reasonable. In other words, a government official can search your home assuming this is reasonable (See dissent part I, paragraph 1). I agree with the Chief Justice when he says the following:\n \nRather than draw such random and happenstance lines- and pretend that the Constitution decreed them-the more reasonable approach is to adopt a rule acknowledging that shared living space entails a limited yielding of privacy to others, and that the law historically permits those to whom we have yielded our privacy to in turn cooperate with the government. Such a rule flows more naturally from our cases concerning Fourth Amendment reasonableness and is logically grounded in the concept of privacy underlying that Amendment.\n\n \n If you want for me to elaborate further on these case, I suggest you atleast read the sylabus so i am not talking to a bunch of people that don't know what is going on.",

   "They could be mad as the want but it wouldn't be illegal (assuming joint ownership of car). \n See dissent owns this point\n \n No, because in relationships there isn't a legal code because people are expected to sort things out on a case by case basis and no one can enforce it anyway. However if you know or suspect your co-owner would object then you are likely breaking the agreement you had about it. The relationship government is more or less the same except because it deals with so many people the general rules are written down.\n \n\n Like waiting for your spouse to go to sleep or go to the can....\n Didn't you read the thing, this isn't enough. You have to attempt to wake them or get them, nor can you intentionally try to circumvent it (by waiting for them to go to work etc). \nSecond, a fine line must be drawn to avoid undercutting Matlock-where the defendant,\n though not present, was in a squad car not far away-and Rod-riguez-where the defendant was asleep in the apartment and could have been roused by a knock on the door; if a potential defendant with self-interest in objecting is in fact at the door and objects, the co-tenant's permission does not suffice for a reasonable search, whereas the potential objector, nearby but not part of the threshold colloquy, loses out.Such formalism is justified. So long as there is no evidence that the police have removed the potentially objecting tenant from the entrance specifically to avoid a possible objection, there is practical\n value in the simple clarity of complementary rules, one recognizing\n the co-tenant's permission when no fellow occupant is on hand, the other according dispositive weight to the fellow occupant's expressed\n contrary indication \n Bear in mind who does the knocking - if our battered wife wants to get the police in then she can do so when the other person is out and there is no problem. However the police can not take action to prevent the suspected objector from coming to the door nor try to wait until he is out. If asked, or if responding to an incident it is a different matter. Whilst I'm not that familiar with how police work goes, I do not think the first action on being called out to a dispute would be to conduct a search of the apartment. Especially if neither party were to request aid from them then, they might follow it up if they think something is going on but then nothing stops them for seeking a warrant or trying to talk to the suspected victim.\n The only people effected by this are the police, if you are desperate to have your house searched you are allowed to be as sneaky as you like as long as you don't tell them you are doing so. As for waiting for people to go to the can, whilst this document doesn't address it precisely, surely you are allowed to rescind your offer to let them search? If the guy comes out and finds the police searching he can send them away, its more or less just delayed asking anyway.\n \n \n\n Yeah, the right for me to decide who can or can't search my property. This case says that if the case of one person saying no then you can't search...even if 5 or 100 people say yes. Furthermore, it says the person that is sleeping can't say no or yes...you don't have the wake them up or let them know of the search. So you deny liberty in that case...for not being at the door at the right time.\n \nNo sensible person would enter\n shared premises based on one occupant's invitation when a fellow tenant said to stay out.\n Is basically this, if one person doesn't want an 'undisirable person' in their house then whilst they are there sensible people should respect their decision. The rules of someone who stole your girlfriend last week have just been extended to the police here.\n \n \n\n Read the case first..otherwise you are bringing up points that make no sense.\n\n You seem to be missing the point with regards to who this is aimed at, this legislation effects the police trying to get round someone who objects having their property searched without probable cause. If you are desperate to have your property searched but suspect that your housemate might object its still very easy to work around.",

That the rule is so random in its application confirms that it bears no real relation to the privacy protected by the Fourth Amendment. What the majority's rule protects is not so much privacy as the good luck of a co-owner who just happens to be present at the door when the police arrive.\n\n I'm not going to comment on the rest of that part of your post because I honestly think you read it wrong (or maybe I am reading it wrong and you can then comment back)\n \n \nIs basically this, if one person doesn't want an 'undisirable person' in their house then whilst they are there sensible people should respect their decision. The rules of someone who stole your girlfriend last week have just been extended to the police here\n You first quote the most idiotic statement in the entire opinion. What do you mean a sensible person should respect their decision? Maybe they should, I don't know..but thats not the point. The point is, not only is this not true but there is no basis in law for this. The dissent points out numerous examples of where a sensible person might enter even if someone doesn't want them to come in.\n \n \nYou seem to be missing the point with regards to who this is aimed at, this legislation effects the police trying to get round someone who objects having their property searched without probable cause. If you are desperate to have your property searched but suspect that your housemate might object its still very easy to work around.\n by waiting for them to fall asleep...",

This wasn't even a point brought up in the case so it isn't like this is in dispute..the court (and anyone that understands the law) accepts this.\nYup, that was just made up but it seemed the sort of thing that they were refering to. Its a similar situation but certainly isn't law, just what I think they are trying to emulate.\n \n\n I am not all certain you read that correctly. \nI'm not certain I did now, sure it was only about 5 pages when I read it first. Ahh - I've only read the first bit, oops. \n \n \nMatlock-where the defendant,\n though not present, was in a squad car not far away-and Rod-riguez-where the defendant was asleep in the apartment and could have been roused by a knock on the door; if a potential defendant with self-interest in objecting is in fact at the door and objects, the co-tenant's permission does not suffice for a reasonable search, whereas the potential objector, nearby but not part of the threshold colloquy, loses out\n Not knowing what the result of Matlock and Rodrigues was I might have just guessed wrong, and if so then I will agree that this is a bit ridiculous. I was assuming that these found in favour of the person who was easily reachable, or detained by the police themselves who obviously didn't give permission rather than in favour of the police. The fine line being what counts as 'at the door'. \n \n Going to have to have a proper read over this, I can still sort of see the idea and vaguely agree with it (from the 4th amendment point of view, not made up my mind if its generally right yet) as it is mainly regarding whether or not the police can search a house if there is someone there who objects, whether at the door or otherwise. Applying this to items is a little shakier, especially if want something general that will apply to more than just married couples, however I think it would be better to err on the side of caution here and just let them take pictures or samples etc, at least enough for a warrant even if they can't take the item itself. \n \n From a legal point of view, should the suprme court be regarding this from the point of view of the exceptional cases (like when the police are investigating you), or as a more general everyday tyranny stopping thing (so that the police can't just go looking for things to investigate about you). They seem backwards, but I'm talking exceptional from your point of view, not the police (who should hopefully be investigating most of the time rather than sneaking into peoples houses)",

   "Could you point that part out please? Not that I agree with the court's ruling in this case, just that the Constitution doesn't say anything about privacy.\n\n I don't think it does say anything about privacy but it seems the justices I like have conceded and use \"privacy\" as what is protected the 4th amendment...they then limit privacy to what the 4th amendment says which is the police can't search your stuff unreasonably or they need to obtain a warrent. I don't think the dissenting judges believes you have an overall right to privacy...and you surely don't in say, a public park or something (you can't have sex privatly for example).\n \n \nIs 'unreasonable' defined, to be that seems more along the lines of 'the police need some reason to search the house, not just on a whim or in hope of finding evidence for something' rather than whether or not the person lets them in or not.\n You could consent to something unreasonable, but that wouldn't make it reasonable, just permitted. \n How is that not reasonable? This wasn't really the question in the case because prior court decisions (for the longest time) have said consent makes a search reasonable. The question is \"was it unreasonable for the policeman to search the home\". If someone gives consent to a search it surely isn't unreasonable to think why he searched the home. So consent isn't the question..it is what happens if you get differing consents to enter the home. The opinion uses an example by saying if you go to your friends home, he invites you in and the roommate yells and say \"don't come in\" then you would surely leave. Chief Justice Roberts combats this and says 1) the majority of the court has no basis for this other than their own personal beliefs and 2) there might be plenty of cases were the person would walk it...say 5 friends say \"come in\" and one other roommate says \"get out\"....surely this might be different. \n \n \n\n As for the sleeping thing, you seem to be making a big deal out of this.

Once they are woken or out they can ask the police to leave can't they?\nThey didn't answer the question about what happens when if the person wakes up. However, if the person is in a squad car or in the backyard or something or maybe sleeping in another room not searched then the search is ok. You claim the court had to set a boundary...yeah, based on what? Nothing! Chief Justice Roberts brings up an important point about this...it isn't so much protecting ones privacy (in this decision) but being lucky that you were at the door in time for the search. If not, just ask the police to come back at a better time emoticon_rolleyes\n It is also ok to have the spouse get the drug stuff, hand it to the police officer, who now has probable cause, and searches the home. \n \n Let me quote some things from the dissent which really rips up the opinion of the court (CJ Roberts, Scalia, and Thomas just laid into the opinion in these three dissents)\n \n \nThe point, of course, is not that a person waives his privacy by sharing space with others such that police may enter at will, but that sharing space necessarily entails a limited yielding of privacy to the person with whom the space is shared, such that the other person shares authority to consent to a search of the shared space\n\n \n Interesting enough, Justice Thomas offers another approach by saying that the fourth amendment has nothing to do with this case. He said if you look at the facts of the case, you will notice that it wasn't so much a search but the woman directed the police to where the evidence was (she actually took them and showed them where the cocaine straw was). Thomas said that this isn't a search as defined by the 4th amendment but more like the woman acting as an agent for the police (much like someone bringing evidence to the police station).\n \n I actually agree with all 3 of the dissents in this case.",

The opinion here said the previous cases were fine and in accordence with the constitution. It is surely reasonable to assume that if one person is present and they consent to a search then it would be ok even if not all the members of ownership are present. An example of this might be a police officer asks to search the car of a teenager he just pulled over. Would he have to wait for her dad to sign a paper agreeing to search or have the dad show up just to do the search? It is perfectly reasonable to assume that the car is of the responbility of the drive at that time and thus ok. Keep in mind, consent is not the only way to make a search reasonable...this is where probable cause comes into play. So now the owner of the teenagers car has assumed the risk of the car being searched while not in his care. Roberts describes this as giving someone else a secret and them shouting it off to the police. The person assumed the risk that the person he told might willingly give up the information even if he is right there to object. \n \n \nIf an individual shares information, papers, or places with another, he assumes the risk that the other person will in turn share access to that information or those papers or places with the government. And just as an individual who has shared illegal plans or incriminating documents with another cannot interpose an objection when that other person turns the informationover to the government, just because the individual happens to be present at the time, so too someone who shares a place with another cannot interpose an objection when that person decides to grant access to the police, simply because the objecting individual happens to be present.\n",

By sharing property of any kind, you give up some privacy and take on the risk that someone else will give access to the shared stuff even if you don't want them to. A good example was used in the case...if 2 roommates share a computer and one is doing illegal activity on it, the legal roommate can get the police and give them access to the computer even if the roommate is right there to object. Why? Well, the both own the computer (both paid for it). The same thing would apply if you lived in a dorm and had a friend comes over. IF you roommate objects then tough it isn't the objectors call.\n \n Even so, a more consistent approach for purchases property would be ownership %. if 30 people owned a house and 29 object then that is 97% of people objecting. It would seem unreasonable then...maybe.",
