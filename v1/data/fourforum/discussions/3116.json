   "Does our terrorism combat really make the world a safer place? The question I've been asking people since that notorious scandal around American public pension funds broke out. I mean if they have been indirectly supporting terrorists by investing billions of dollars in companies that do business in nations that sponsor terrorism then they have been counteracting us in Iraq and Afghanistan. The thing I will never understand. Why waist billions of dollars in Iraq for peacekeeping efforts and at the same time sponsor, say, the criminal regime of Iran, which makes thousands of mercenaries march through its border and kill our soldiers. There must be something in it otherwise it's nonsense. \n Guess what they found out! The elephants and the donkeys from the Congress have their paw in the pot. That's why the dead fish hasn't been used by either party in its election campaign. No wonder if they have some other fishy stuff concealed from the public. For instance I heard that the Boston Committee Against Ethnic Cleansing has a hand in that tragedy in Beslan. It has lately purchased uniform and ammunition in America for detachments of Chechen guerrillas' leader Maskhadov whose people seized the Russian school with several hundreds of children in it. \n Another scandal? American human rights organizations, at least one of them, engaged in arms sales to terrorists?\n So does our terrorism combat REALLY make the world SAFER?",

   "No because the root causes of terrorism are not being addressed. Terrorism is basically a form of warfare. It is cheap, relatively effective and depending on the targets relatively easy. As such terrorism will always exsist as long as their are people who feel their cause is worth dieing for.",

That Russian matter has been going on for hundreds of years. Who happens to be the terrorists is, like US problems, a political label because the causes are being studiously ignored. \n \n IMO our 'War on Terror' is a pathetic and extremely expensive government effort to make the US public feel secure.

   "That's funny. When I fly commercial I always have to take my shoes off because they all have a steel shank that sets the detector alarm off. I still can't believe Americans are lulled into a sense of false security with such activities. All commercial airplanes now have cockpit doors that look like they belong on a bank vault.

   " As such terrorism will always exsist as long as their are people who feel their cause is worth dieing for.\n\n \n That is very true. Up until 9-11, the biggest terror attack in the US was perpetrated by a couple guys from Michigan. They blew up the Oklahoma Federal Building with fertilizer.\n \n \n \n IMO our 'War on Terror' is a pathetic and extremely expensive government effort to make the US public feel secure. \n\n \n I agree, it is all about feelings. It has become one of those &#8220;feel good&#8221; programs, like the war on poverty or the war on drugs. \n \n Osama Bin Laden said there were two reasons for the attack on 9-11. I don&#8217;t think we should change our policies to appease terrorists, but maybe we should give these policies a second look. It might save thousands of lives in the future. Oh, I forgot, there is nothing we can do except give up our liberty, and spend more money to fight the &#8220;feel good&#8221; war.",

Those politicians and bureaucrats who would perform that task are accustomed to being surrounded by legions of personal security using the latest in armament and technology now unhampered by due cause laws, travel by private aircraft and armored convoys that freeze air traffic over and gridlock traffic in any city they visit and meals served by personal chefs in private dining rooms. The only people made safer by our war on terror are the Washington power crowd and they love those perks. Don't hold your breath waiting for a change in policy or restoration of our civil rights.",

The majority of radical Islamists are of Middle Eastern descent. I would prefer not to get attacked again, if that's alright with you, even if it means hurting a few people's feelings.",

   "So does our terrorism combat REALLY make the world SAFER?\n\n actually it would, if we were fighting terrorists. the terrorists that hate america and plot daily to see every non-muslim dead generally reside in muslime-governed countries or countries with a high muslim influence, like saudi arabia, yemen, jordan, pallestine, lybia, egypt, etc. in all these countries, and about a dozen more, are KNOWN terrorist organizations and networks, many affiliated with al qaeda. they are training and recruiting more operatives even as we speak.\n \n the combat our troops are involved in have absolutely nothing to do with terrorism. we are shooting at rebels and insurgents that are trying to resist us from keeping iraq in our control. these people are sometimes \n civilians with guns, shooting back at our troops, but they are not terrorists. in fact, our methods of random bombing and killing innocent iraqi civilians in order to discourage further resistance much better fits the description of terrorist activity than the iraqi methods of banding together to resist the invasion and defend their country\n \n if we were indeed killing terrorists, like the people behind the 9/11 attack, for instance, then i would strongly agree that combating terrorists will make the world safer. sadly, thats not in the least what we are doing",
