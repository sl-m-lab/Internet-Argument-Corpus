   " Power of the Second Amendment helps to guard all of us \n It's not news that I don't want a gun in my house. It's also no secret that I will defend your right to have a gun if you want one.\n \n A citizenry that cannot defend itself against a government gone wrong is a conquered citizenry. A citizenry that has no way to fight against a leader who believes one race is superior to another is a dead citizenry. History has proved that to us in countless ways and around the world.\n \n The notion that jackbooted thugs, under the color of authority, could ever begin to bend the masses to their will by sheer force is not one I ever want to entertain. Weapons, I have to admit, help level the playing field.\n\n One is not anti Federal Police, authority, or anti-government just because one thinks this way. It is good for all of the above to be reminded, from time to time, that this is Our Country and Our Constitution. You work for us law-abiding citizens of this country! It is not the other way around! Your authority is result of We the People delegating you to act on our behalf! \n  The Declaration of Independence \n We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,\n\n Republicans, Democrats and all Federal Government. That is what YOU are employed by us to do! To secure these rights!!!!\n \n I know some here think it is the other way around? emoticon_smile\n  Color of Law \n U.S. law enforcement officers and other officials like judges, prosecutors, and security guards have been given tremendous power by local, state, and federal government agencies-authority they must have to enforce the law and ensure justice in our country. These powers include the authority to detain and arrest suspects, to search and seize property, to bring criminal charges, to make rulings in court, and to use deadly force in certain situations. \n \n Preventing abuse of this authority, however, is equally necessary to the health of our nation's democracy. That's why it's a federal crime for anyone acting under \"color of law\" willfully to deprive or conspire to deprive a person of a right protected by the Constitution or U.S. law. \"Color of law\" simply means that the person is using authority given to him or her by a local, state, or federal government agency.\n\n Any questions? emoticon_smile",
