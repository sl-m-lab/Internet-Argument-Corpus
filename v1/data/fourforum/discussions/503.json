Did you know that there are mass demonstrations in the street calling for the end of US occupation? The Shi'ite Muslims, which make up over 60% of Iraq, have DEMANDED that we be out in a month. We are not seen as liberators. You're shown pictures of Saddam statues being pulled down by Iraqi citizens, but you are not shown everything else. Oh, and by the way, the BBC did a little side on the pictures of Saddam's statue being pulled down by the \"masses\". There were actually only about 2 dozen people, so the photographers zoomed in on them to make it look like a huge crowd. Just another discreet little way you're being lied to.\n \n And what damage???? We have permanantly scarred relations around the world. And your definition of a \"true ally\" is someone who agrees with you all the time....and to be honest that's really quite stupid. We have no proof of weapons of mass destruction, we never did. Yes Saddam gassed his only people and killed them, and blah blah, but didn't care at the time he did it? Why do we care now? Oh and by the way it is against international law for one country to move into another without proof for a regime change. So basically our the people you say aren't are \"true allies\" are the people who believe in keeping international law. \n \n The real damage is that US hatred is blazing across the Middle East. The Muslims in Iraq hate us, and the groups that already hated us now have a new reason to fight. The CIA published a report on terrorists threats in the Middle East that stated terror activity would sky rocket if we invaded Iraq, Iran, or Syria.\n \n Oh, and by the way this war is not about the liberation of the Iraqi people, a country cannot invade another to \"free it's people\". Iraqi Freedom is just used as a distraction from the real purpose in the war, WMD's.

It was not a main reason, but it was still a reason.\n \n \nSecond: It will be harder in the future for the US to garner support if it is necessary to go to war. No one will believe us. Even the American people will be skeptical.\n\n \n True.\n \n \nIt is not the US's job to insure freedom throughout the world. \n\n \n It's the job of the U.S. to protect itself from attacks or invasions led by cruel dictators or clandestine terrorist leaders. Proving freedom to a country ruled by a cruel dictator who is also known to have been friendly with terrorists is a way to help with rotection of the U.S.\n \n \nWhat kind of freedom? We lose our liberty everyday due to legislation passed by our representatives (gun control, public education, and other legislation). \n \n\n \n We still have our freedom of thought and speech.\n \n \nLiberals think like you, just through money or American lives at a problem (i.e. foreign dictators) and it will solve it. I disagree.\n\n \n Fortunately I am neither liberal nor conservative, I'm in the middle. I agree with you. I don't think we should invade Iran, Syria, or North Korea. (yet)",

According to Ossama the attack of 9-11 was in retaliation for our support of Israel and our stationing of troops in Saudi Arabia. Our best \"protection\" is to worry about ourselves, not get involved in other counties affairs.\n \n \nOriginally posted by Habbit \n \n We still have our freedom of thought and speech.\n\n \n I am against the Patriot and Homeland Security Acts.

I agree with you. I don't think we should invade Iran, Syria, or North Korea. (yet) \n\n \n I think Iran will be our next target. I predict more terrorist attacks against the US due to our policies. One good thing though, I hear Ossama is running out of money.\n \n My non-interventionist views goes back to the eighties. I had no idea that our interventionist policies would lead to something as horrific as 9-11. I was a non-interventionist as a matter of principle.",

I think the administration is going to fund the resistance movements in Syria and Iran... those regimes could fall quickly if we gave them some cash and weapons and did a little air support. \n\n \n Things like this can backfire. Example: Afghanistan. We supplied the Taliban with stingers and other weapons. Now these stingers were used to shoot down Israeli planes over Africa and could possibly make there way back to the states. Also the CIA was instrumental in Saddam's rise to power. We backed him going back to the early sixties and finally were able to get him in power.\n \n \nOriginally posted by Broker \n  North Korea has nuclear weapons... can't invade them, and the only way we can kill Kim is to plant some explosives on some of his women... \n\n \n I agree. In fact I don't want to back Kim into a corner. I was against Bush including him in the axis of evil. What purpose did his statement make? Right after Bushes proclamation Kim started his nuclear weapons program.\n \n \nOriginally posted by Broker \n  The people of many countries in the Middle East are very Western... they were against the war, but hey, the line for McDonalds in Kuwait City was 2 and a half hours long, and a lot of the Iraqis I saw were drinking Pepsi. \n\n \n That is interesting. They love our Starbucks but hate us. They don't realize that our freedom made all of these great things possible. Good point.\n \n Thanks for the dialog Broker.",

   "Well, it happens. You think they have certain intentions and it's good to support them... we supported Castro at first until he announced he was setting up a communist government. That support can often mean a lot... I say support them, and if they go sour withdraw your support and slap some sanctions on them.\n \n Kim had the program before that.

You can't just start a program and get results in a year or two... if it was that easy we would be in big trouble. \n \n Yes, I know.

But I think if we do like we did Germany and Japan, Iraq would be a nice place in ten years. I hope so...",

We support somebody, they come to power then they turn or we turn and we slap sanctions. Sanctions can and do lead to war. Remember the Shaw of Iran? We helped him come to power.
