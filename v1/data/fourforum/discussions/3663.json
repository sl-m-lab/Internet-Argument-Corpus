   "...and only 5 of them won!\n \n The Michael Mooron-icized Democrats have been continuing to MoveOn further Left in this election cycle. Indeed, these far-Left nuts have become the mainstream in the party. Unfortunately for them, this doesn't bode well for Democrats seeking national office. Twenty-seven House and Senate candidates were endorsed by MoveOn PAC in this year's election. Only five managed to claim victory: Melissa Bean in Illinois's Eighth District; Sen. Patty Murray of Washington won re-election; John Salazar won in Colorado's Third District, an open seat; Ken Salazar defeated Republican beer magnate Pete Coors for Colorado's open Senate seat; and Allyson Schwartz won Pennsylvania's open seat in District 13. That means candidates endorsed by MoveOn went 5-22, a pretty lousy batting average of .185! The moral of the story? If you're thinking of running for national office, fellow Patriots, try to square off with a MoveOn candidate. Your chances will increase dramatically!",
