According to the 1900 census, the 18 wives in the Orchard Street building had given birth to 111 children altogether, of whom 67 were then alive. \n \n A 40 percent infant and child mortality rate sounds shocking now. Back then it was the norm. Maternal mortality was 99 percent higher than it is today; 40 percent of those deaths were caused by infection, of which half resulted from illegal or self-induced abortion. Birth control was to revolutionize women's health. But it would take a social revolution to get there.\n \n In 1912, Margaret Sanger was a nurse serving poor Lower East Side women like Sadie Sachs, a mother of three who had been warned that another pregnancy would kill her. When Sadie asked her doctor how to prevent pregnancy, he told her to tell her husband to sleep on the roof. Pregnant again, Sadie self-induced an abortion, contracted an infection and died. \n \n Sanger began to address women's lack of information about birth control by writing a sex education column called \"What Every Girl Should Know\" for The Call, a socialist newspaper. But in 1914, a warrant was issued for Sanger's arrest. She stood accused of violating the Comstock law, which made it a crime to circulate \"obscenity\" through the mail. \n \n Passed in 1873 in response to pressure from a crusader named Anthony Comstock, the law defined information about contraception or abortion as obscenity. Comstock boasted that he destroyed hundreds of tons of \"lewd and lascivious material,\" including 60,000 \"obscene rubber articles,\" otherwise known as condoms. \n \n In place of Sanger's column, The Call ran an empty box that read: \"What Every Girl Should Know - nothing, by order of the United States Post Office!\" Never intimidated, Sanger published \"The Woman Rebel,\" a periodical intended to challenge Comstock laws directly. She then fled to Europe, where she visited a birth control clinic in the Netherlands and began to envision setting up a network of clinics throughout the United States. \n \n By the time she returned to America, public opinion was swinging her way, and she sensed the time was right for action. On Oct. 16, 1916, Sanger opened America's first birth control clinic in the Brownsville district of Brooklyn. Her sister, Ethel Byrne, was the nurse; it would be some time before they could get a doctor to join the effort. Handbills in English, Yiddish and Italian advertised the clinic throughout the neighborhood.\n \n The police closed that clinic 10 days and 464 patients later. But Sanger, who would go on to establish the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, had founded something much larger than a clinic: she ignited a movement for women's reproductive freedom. \n \n During the 20th century, this movement won such decisive victories that today many people cannot believe they could ever be reversed: birth control and then abortion were made legal; better contraceptive methods, like the pill, were developed; and the government started financing family planning for low-income women. Today, more than 90 percent of Americans have used birth control.\n \n When Sanger opened her clinic, women wouldn't get the vote for four more years. And yet the debates of her day over suffrage and contraception sound strikingly familiar to modern ears. Would such policies promote women's equality or destroy the family? Would they advance justice or spread promiscuity? Where was the line between medical care and pornography? The answers, then as now, depend on your views about women, sex and power.\n \n The current struggle over birth control, abortion and sex education make clear that courageous actions like Sanger's are as necessary now as they were 90 years ago. For if anyone doubts that women's reproductive freedom has been crucial to American progress, I recommend a short walk through the lives of the women of 97 Orchard Street.\n Gloria Feldt, the author of \"The War on Choice: The Right-Wing Attack on Women's Rights and How to Fight Back,\" is a former president of Planned Parenthood.",

I would say you are using 21st Century morals to judge a person who was brought up with 19th/early 20th century morals.

That is where your Hitler comparison fails. It is precisely those things that he did which stood out from the populace - being the cause of the Holocaust through his leadership, his desire to dominate and exploit the rest of the world - that he is judged by. I am sure that there were many negative aspects which he also shared with the populace in general, but his name is condemned in human history for the negative extremes to which he went.\n \n Margaret Sanger, in contrast, stood out from the general populace in her pioneering efforts in reproductive rights. From many of the posts here, I understand that her views of eugenics, though negative, were negative views held by large portions of the population - just like the fact that Washington owned slaves. Are you claiming that Margaret Sanger stood out from the population of her time in some negative way?",

   "I wouldn't be putting Margaret Sanger on a pedestal if I were you until you read more about her. It's pretty well known that she was a big proponent of racial eugenics and toward the disabled in the same vein as Nazism. \n \"\"Every single case of inherited defect, every malformed child, every congenitally tainted human being brought into this world is of infinite importance to that poor individual; but it is of scarcely less importance to the rest of us and to all of our children who must pay in one way or another for these biological and racial mistakes\" (Pivot of Civilization, p. 274).\"\n \n \"No more children should be born when the parents, though healthy themselves, find that their children are physically or mentally defective\" (Woman and the New Race [NY: Blue Ribbon Books, 1920], p. 89).\n \n \"Feeble-mindedness perpetuates itself from the ranks of those who are blandly indifferent to their racial responsibilities. And it is largely this type of humanity we are now drawing upon to populate our world for the generations to come. In this orgy of multiplying and replenishing the earth, this type is pari passu multiplying and perpetuating those direst evils which we must, if civilization is to survive, extirpate by the very roots\" (\"The Need of Birth Control in America,\" in Birth Control: Facts and Responsibilities, edited by Adolf Meyer, 11-49 [Baltimore: The Williams and Wilkins Co., 1925]).\n \n \n \"Like the advocates of Birth Control, the eugenists, for instance, are seeking to assist the race toward the elimination of the unfit. Both are seeking a single end but they lay emphasis upon different methods. . . . Eugenics without Birth Control seems to us a house builded upon the sands. It is at the mercy of the rising stream of the unfit\" (\"Birth Control and Racial Betterment,\" ibid., p. 11-12.) \n \n \". . . let us not close our eyes to one of the greatest dangers inherent in such warm-hearted humanitarianism. For it is a curious but neglected fact that the very types which in all kindness should be obliterated from the human stock, have been permitted to reproduce themselves and to perpetuate their group, succored by the policy of indiscriminate charity of warm hearts uncontrolled by cool heads\" (\"The Need of Birth Control in America,\" Birth Control: Facts and Responsibilities, Adolf Meyer, editor [Baltimore: Williams and Wilkins Co., 1925], p. 15).\n \n Planned Parenthood has tried, for years, to put a positive spin on Margaret Sanger, but her words speak for themselves.\n\n \n Despite your concerns, how much of these statements regarding eugenics have come to pass?

   "Whoa, I didn't say there was a movement telling women not to be mothers. \n\n \n EXACTLY!\n \n \nI said there seems to be a lot less emphasis in your movement on encouraging women to make the motherhood choice than in encouraging them to excercise their choice for abortion.\n\n \n That is becuase of the fact that nobody is trying to stop women from being mothers. Nobody is trying to put and end to that choice. If they ever do, I will fight it, I promise you.\n \n \nThe provide resources, a lot more about abortion than the other choice: having a baby.\n\n \n Maybe in part because there are plenty more resouces (OBs, hospitals and clinics) out that provide care for pregnant women than there are that provide abortions.",
