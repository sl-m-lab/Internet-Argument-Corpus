If I don't like something at one end of the spectrum, it doesn't mean I like music at the other end (which I don't). Get over yourselves, the world doesn't revolve around power chords, self pity, drug abuse, and screaming.\n\n WOW The Violence!",

   "I believe the thread question was ...Any other fans here.... not anyone wanna dis the best grunge band theres ever been. why dont you go listen to some brintney spears, or Jessica simpson.\n\n \n This is facinating. It doesn't get any worse than this. So some once popular grunge band gets the treatment and suddenly it's detractors have a preference for a snot nosed pop princess. Has it occured to you or anyone that there is a bit more format diversification than a choice between an overated grunge band and tweeny pop? I never did get the popularity of Nirvana. They seemed mediocre at best. I prefer the following: Linkin Park, Boston, Phil Collins, Kansas, 3 Doors Down, Creed, John Mayer, Billy Joel, Credence Clearwater Revival, Puddle of Mudd, Bad Company, The Eagles, Gordon Lightfoot, Van Halen(with both David Lee Roth and Sammy Hagar), Journey, Ozzy Osbourne, ZZ Top, The Cars, David Bowie, Led Zeppelin, Incubus, Bon Jovi (not the recent stuff), Supertramp, The Doors, The Moody Blues, Yes, Breaking Benjamin, Foreigner, Kiss, Metallica, Rush, Ted Nugent, Toto, Pat Benatar, Pink Floyd, 5 For Fighting, Rush... Ok you get the point. The only pop princess I can really stomach (and there are a few of her songs I actually like) is Christina Aguilera. That may surprise some but as you can see from my list, my preferences vary and most certainly do NOT emphasize the silly blonde bimbos. \n \n Next time, an essay on how some \"liberal\" artists misunderstand their audience (Linda Ronstadt pay attention).",

   "My apologies, i was being more sarcastic then serious, i agree with most of your choices on music, i like nirvana because they express their frustration and anger into their songs. So I like them, i wont say you have to, its my choice....but out of many grunge bands i do think Nirvana hit the top 10. \n \n Along with nirvana i like....tilt, the weakerthans, alanis morsette, Verve Pipe, Janes addiction, Weezer, Garbage, the beatles, Red hot chilli peppers, Modest mouse, i dunno...theres more i just cant think of them right now....",
