   "This list is a bunch of baloney.\n \n FOUR different Chicago neighborhoods are listed here, and handguns are 100%, completely, without a doubt, BANNED there.\n \n How can they be the most violent since \"gun\" violence is the worst kind of violence, and there are no guns in Chicago because of gun control?\n \n Strict gun control lowers violence, right? That's what many here say. How do you get any harsher that a 100% complete BAN? According to gun control supporters, this should mean Chicago is 100% completely SAFE, right?\n \n Then why is it mentioned FOUR times in this report?\n \n Maybe one of them could explain the discrepancy. (Although, I doubt it. Their usual MO is to redirect the discussion.)",
