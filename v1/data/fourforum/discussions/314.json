   "After bouncing the topic of this off my brother I have one more thing to add and it all deals with a 10 year old intentionally murdering someone. If a kid that is 10 years old shoots someone, I think I'd support executing the parents of this kid before I would excute the kid. What 10 year old do you know that has formed his own ideas and isn't just an extension of his parents ideas and ideals? At 10 years of age do you think you would have shot someone if your parents told you to? I know I had a lot of trust in my parents and if they told me to do something like that and said it would be alright and it's what I should do, I'm sure they could have convinced me to do it. Now extend that over 10 years and lower the pressure on the child from the parents down to the father owning a gun and leaving it in the open and teaching his kid that violence solves problems.\n \n I guess to figure out whether this debate can even be used with you I would like to know whether you think a 10 year old child would more often then not kill a person based on his own ideas and not his parents? I'm saying more often than not because I want to establish that the kid is often at fault and not the parents. I would clearly debate that the parental influence is going to drive the kid to kill if he is to do so intentionally. If you agree with this then do you agree that the parents should be jailed for influencing their kid to act like this? If not, then why do you let the parents off for teaching their kid this and not let the kid off when he really didn't do anything other than what he was taught?\n \n I think there are many steps I would take to try before inacting the solution of executing 10 year olds. I would force licenses and tests to be taken to establish that only good parents have kids before I would see a 10 year old in the electric chair. Of course before that I would determine if the problem is so bad that it calls for any measures at all to be taken.",

   "Well according to California Sate law, the state in which I live, a juvenile under the age of fourteen cannot legally commit a crime. There are circumstances where a juvenile can be charged with a crime, however you have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the juvenile knows the difference between right/wrong and that juveniles knows the consequences of his/her actions. \n \n In addition juveniles are (generally) not held to the same accountability as adults, therefore when the crime is committed, unfortunately they will not have the same punishment as their adult counter parts. Usually when a juvenile commits a crime that is punishable by the death penalty the tax payer gets to pay for them to grow up, their schooling (including college), then send them out on the streets at the age of twenty-two and tell them to live a normal life and most importantly...remember what you did was bad don't do it again. \n \n Although putting the child to death may sound like an easy solution and punishment for their crime, I am not sure how many physicians, Youth Authority personnel, or the general population would be able to look a twelve year old kid in the face, put an IV in their arm, and then watch them die.",

   "Yes but I think its also fair and adequate to also impose fair punishment.\n\n \n Then the question becomes what is fair and adequate? If a 10 year old murders someone, I don't think it is fair to give them the chair. If they are criminally insane, then treat them as insane. If not, then put them in juvie/jail. I think that is fair. The difference for a 30 year old is that they have had time to learn a lot more life lessons than a 10 year old and they are generally going to be capable of higher level thinking than a 10 year old, so why is it fair to treat them the same way?\n \n \nYes I think however you prosecute an adult for accidental murder is the same way you should prosecute anyone for accidental murder. It is really on a case by case basis.\n \n Well actaully without going into a long debate and explination about this I'd like to say that cases such as this I don't think much punishment is required for any age, as long as it was an accident. Perhaps in these cases a year or two of jail time is adequate assuming it was an accident. \n If the child had died... Probably still a couple of years of jail. \n \n (Although I don't intend on wanting any child put into an adult child of course. When under the age of eighteen or twenty-one the prisoner should be kept seperated from the serial killers.)\n\n \n As strange as your idea sounds at first it only gets stranger. You want the child to be treated like an adult yet when in jail you want them treated differently from adults. I don't understand this.\n \n Anyways, what good will 2 years in jail do for a 6 or 7 year old anyways? If they were given no jail time they would probably turn out just fine. Given jail time they will be hardened at the age of 7 and learn only the lessons taught in jail for the next two years. So by time they are 9 they are surely going to be a head case and be far more hardened and unstable. Do you agree with this? If so, how is this a real solution to a problem? Wouldn't it be better for the US to have a productive person out of this 7 year old rather than one influenced by criminals? Of course a 7 year old is going to be very influenced by their surroundings in the early years of their life so jail is going to be traumatic for them, more so than it would be for a 30 year old. Now mix that in with taking them away from the father and mother. So how will this affect the child? How will this affect the parents?\n \n Ultimately it seems to me that you see that a negative thing happened therefore you want justice. Would you define justice as taking a kid from his parents and losing 2 years of his life only to be hurt mentally by it for the rest of his life due to an accident that no one could have prevented? I hope this is not your view of justice. That view of justice is that two wrongs can make a right.\n \n \nI know of none. I think all cases of the same crime (with the exceptions) regardless of age should be prosecuted the same.\n\n \n So basically there is no evidence that your measures will lower crime. So based on what evidence do you believe that making this change would be good for America? I hope that your reasoning isn't just that you think that is seems right. There has to be something beneficial about it to counteract the negatives or this will be doing a diservice to America as a whole. I think the ultimate goal of our legal system is to help America function better.\n \n \nOf course if the parents are involved in the murder they should see punishment. Assuming that he is not being forced to pull the trigger the child is still capable of making his own decisions and therfor he should face the consequences of them.\n\n \n Well then of course all parents will be involved in the murder in some way or another. Even by influence alone they will be involved.\n \n \nIf I or anyone had been raised in a household where parents radically brainwashed the child to kill of course I would probably kill. That is why the parents along with the child should face punishment.\n\n \n So you admit that you would have killed if your parents told you to. Alright, now do you think you would have benefited from jail time following this? Do you think you would have benefited more from being put up for adoption and being given more loving parents? I would think that hands down the most beneficial thing to do here would be to allow the child to start over with new parents and better influences. I know that is what would help me most if I were in this type of a situation. How about yourself? If you agree with me then isn't it better for America that the better thing be done?\n \n \nPerhaps in some cases the punishment could be lighter on the child. \n The execution of juveniles does not apply in every case because there are always exceptions.\n\n \n How would you determine whether the punishment should be light or not? If you are going to base it on how much the parents were involved, would you blame the parents at all if they neglected their child and he eventually became a bad person? I'm guessing you would still blame the child since the parents were not directly involved although psychologically they were very involved in the problem. \n \n \nI'm unable to get to the page.\n\n \n CNN only keeps their articles up for a short period of time.\n \n \nWhen the child does not know right from wrong and in other cases as you have mentioned of course a different approach should be taken.\n\n \n lol, how will you determine when a child knows right from wrong? Of course the child will know it is wrong to kill. However, do you think the child understands what it means to kill or die? I don't think there will be a way to determine this although my guess is that all children under the age of 12 won't have any idea what that means. Tell me, when did you learn what it meant to kill or die? How did you know that you learned what it meant? How do you think someone other than you could have determined when you learned what it meant?\n \n Do you see the complexities of this problem. They all revolve around life experience and what has been learned. A 7 year old will not have all the concept necessary to understand what murder is.\n \n \nSomewhere I am getting the impression that you don't take my opinion seriously.\n Maybe its just me...\n\n \n I can't really take your opinion seriously either. I'm sure you understand the flaws of it in that children are not able to understand what a 20 year old can understand. Also children are going to be affected differently by jail than a 20 year old. Children are still learning when they are young so to put them in jail will teach them new lessons while a 20 year old may try to unlearn previously learned lessons. The child isn't going to be a better person for being in jail as jail is meant to correct adults and is not focused on correcting children. Juvie is made to correct children and of course there are many other ways to teach children who are still young, far more options than are open to teach a 20 year old as the child is still learning. There are just so many more options open to troubled children and your idea is to scrap all those ideas and just focus on one and of course that one idea isn't even part of the current group of ideas that may help correct a trouble child. I really don't know where you are coming from with this idea that jail time an executions will benefit America as a whole or individual Americans in any way more than they are currently benefited by our current system. The idea that a 7 year old can be treated as an adult is an idea so flawed that to debate it doesn't even make sense so I don't even know why I'm here. As it stands now if I were to take your opinion seriously I would have to change my view of you as far as your ability to understand human psychology.",

Because before you said-\n \n \nWhen you kill someone your killing someone. Same crime. Same time. That simple.\n\n \n Which is simply not the way the American court system works.\n \n I'd like to know how you would determine whether a child knows \"right from wrong\", as you say. As well, two seperate 33 year olds will not get the same charge for having killed someone, how is a child who has killed someone supposed to be given \"the same penalty\"? There is no single penalty for killing someone, there are several depending on the state and the decisions of the jury and sentencing judge. Not to mention the performance of the prosecutor and defense lawyers\n \n Also, behaviour that would be qualified as psychosis in an adult is developmentally appropriate in a healthy child reacting to an unhealthy environment. Thus, someone who might \"get off\" on an insanity plea as an adult would not qualify as insane if they were a minor, but might be just as unable to understand reality and just as irresponsible for their actions. \n \n I've heard of kids killing someone to protect themselves or others, or to stop someone from harrassing them. I've heard of kids doing things that might lead to a murder or criminal negligence charge because of bad judgement due to bad environment. These are considered in any case as mitigating circumstances. \n \n I guess the point is that children are not adults. Physically, psychologically, developmentally different. You can't judge a crime the same way if the person doing it has different abilities, capacities, and a different motive. It isn't the same situation anymore.\n \n \nSomewhere I am getting the impression that you don't take my opinion seriously.\n Maybe its just me...\n\n \n Who, me?

A 7 year old will not have all the concept necessary to understand what murder is.\n \n \n Most will have enough and I think I have addressed the other factors.\n \n \nI can't really take your opinion seriously either.\n \n \n I never said I didn't take your opinion seriously.\n \n \nThe idea that a 7 year old can be treated as an adult is an idea so flawed that to debate it doesn't even make sense so I don't even know why I'm here. As it stands now if I were to take your opinion seriously I would have to change my view of you as far as your ability to understand human psychology.\n \n \n Your here because I am challenging your idea. I don't know much about human physchology. \n \n \nI don't think many juries would select the death penalty either.\n \n \n Probably not...\n \n Max,\n \n \nI'd like to know how you would determine whether a child knows \"right from wrong\", as you say. As well, two seperate 33 year olds will not get the same charge for having killed someone, how is a child who has killed someone supposed to be given \"the same penalty\"? \n \n \n I am not expert but that can be determined. The same penalty assuming that he as well as the 33 year old killed the person purposefully and they knew right from wrong.\n \n \n Thus, someone who might \"get off\" on an insanity plea as an adult would not qualify as insane if they were a minor, but might be just as unable to understand reality and just as irresponsible for their actions. \n \n \n A type of \"insanity\" plea could also be implemented for children.\n \n \nI've heard of kids killing someone to protect themselves or others, or to stop someone from harrassing them. I've heard of kids doing things that might lead to a murder or criminal negligence charge because of bad judgement due to bad environment. These are considered in any case as mitigating circumstances. \n \n \n Of course these factors cannot be ignored in such cases especially with those of such a young age.\n \n \nI guess the point is that children are not adults. Physically, psychologically, developmentally different. You can't judge a crime the same way if the person doing it has different abilities, capacities, and a different motive. It isn't the same situation anymore.\n \n \n Most killings by juveniles do not deserve executions, but there are some that do.\n \n \nWho, me? What makes you say that, Mr. Grinch?\n\n \n I beleive it was the following comment made by you...\n \n \n \nYou're a real people-lover. Aren't you the guy who was supposed to have put all those nails in apples at Halloween?\n\n \n --- Note: Excuse my next responses which will probably be delayed due to my interest in another debate I'm having which I am gather information for and spending alot of time on.",

   "If you provide some serious arguments, maybe that would help. I happen to think that your view of \"justice\" in painfully simplistic.\n\n \n You found the words that I was looking for.\n \n I think SilentPoet is failing to take a look at the whole picture and is focusing on just one side of it. Does it seem just that we recognize a murder as a murder regardless of who did it? Yes I believe this is the case. This leads to the idea that children who murder should be recognized as doing the same crime as an adult who murdered and should pay the same price. But this fails to take a look at many other aspects including what will actually work best. Could we give an insane person a life sentence for murder? Of course we could. Didn't he commit the same crime regardless of sanity? Yes he did. Why don't we put him in jail? Because it doesn't do us any good. He probably doesn't even know he did anything wrong so punishing him is pointless and of course trying to rehab someone who doesn't think properly will not work. The same would go for a child. Assuming that they know right from wrong is simplistic. Right is good and wrong is bad. But assuming they really can figure out for themselves and understand the difference between what is really right and what isn't just as an adult can is like saying that a child should be able to understand the world as well as an adult can. How can one debate the worth of experience, knowledge, and brain development when it comes to determining what is right and wrong? The difference is apparent and to ignore this bigger picture to focus on just a small portion of the picture makes it very difficult to find the right answer. The big picture is to determine what is best solution for the people, including the criminals, as a whole.",

   "Mizmaxx,\n \n \nEvidently. In which case I wonder how you can argue that you know that children \"understand right from wrong\" as does an adult. \n \n \n When I speak of juvenile executions your mind too quickly jumps to the lower ages. Most cases under 7 years probably won't be considered for execution. But I do think that most if not all cases of 12 and above should be considered for execution.\n (Most children 6+ know right from wrong.

Again, you are demonstrating your lack of understanding of the way the US court system works.\n \n \n I'm aware as you all have made perfectly clear atleast 3 times that there are different \"forms\" of murder.

When others do not change their mind to agree with you, you argue for a bit and then state that there is no point in continuing. \n \n This at least is what it seems. \n \n I really am curious how you determine when to stop. What criteria do you use or is it something like you just tire of the subject?\n\n \n I have repeated my same point many many times and elabroated and counter argued your arguments. With all of that the debate is just repeating itself. \n \n I didn't mean to make it seem like your choice.\n \n Perhaps you could provide \"alot\" of examples (since you said I do it alot) when I argue for a bit and then \"state that there is no point in continuing\".",

What is he going to do outside of prison?\n\n \n \n If you are talking about education it is definately possibly for the prisoner to get one. They have all types of programs in prison including ones where you can get an education so this is not something to worry about. No the person wouldn't know what finishing highschool and being in college is like , but that was his choice to kill someone he made that decision on his own and should have been aware of the consiquences.",

   "DeathPreventor:Death is a common case these days, yet it is a high crime that should not be permitted. More time and money should be put into rehabilitation centers than into finding a way on how to kill someone. Death to Juveniles is worse of all, for it is defying their own law in Third Degree manslaughter. Why does the government even support this, I do not have the answer for that, yet I do have an answer that Juveniles should not be put to death. It is foul to even think about. My opinion is strong in this case, for people can change giving the right stimulus. It makes me sick to think of the death of someone, even though they had killed or broken a major law. If the rehabilitation centers are around, then why do we kill them anyways? There is no point in rehabilitation centers if we are just going to kill them anyways.",

   "In legal studies we have just finished doing speeches on any human rights issue that we wanted to do. A few people did speeches on \"Juvenile Executions\". I personally few that it is disgraceful to be terminating a 13 year old kid's life. Children have the best success in rehabilitation, and thus should be given a chance to live a normal life - one without crime. I am against executions all together, but I am totally against juvenile executions. If rehabilitation is successul, than the kid should be able to stay away from being in the legal system. \n \n Appearently America (shock, shock) has the highest amount of child or juvenile executions around the whole world! Everyone should be given a second chance to prove themselves, especially children.",
