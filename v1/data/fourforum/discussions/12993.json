   "For those interested in voting on the issue; \"When does a human individual's life begin?\" (click on the link)\n \n \n The purpose of this thread is to continue/reboot the debate between myself and Chuz Life within the general topic of abortion legality. \n\n \n Fair enough. \n \n However, before we start I would like to clarify a few minor points in your opening challenge.\n \n \n My contention is this: since joining the forums, Chuz has posted (1) pro-life arguments based on the (2) initial assumption of \"the fact that a human individuals life biologically begins at conception\".\n\n \n 1. IANGB, I consider my arguments to be \"anti-elective abortion\" not \"pro-life.\" And I would appreciate it if you would try to understand the differences between the two. \"Pro-lifers\" approach the abortion debate from an \"all life is sacred\" generally religious based point of view. I do not. I neither believe that \"all life is sacred\" nor that \"god\" or religion should be used in the debate at all.\n \n 2. My argument that a \"human individual's life biologically begins at conception\" is not an \"assumption.\" It is a conclusion. A conclusion reached by an in depth study of the facts and references available. Please don't malign my position in this way again as I will not attempt to malign yours.\n \n \n \n However, ever since he (Chuz) started a thread attempting to convince others of this 'fact', he has consistently ignored the vast majority of arguments against his reasoning - while continuing to tout the 'fact' in other threads. \n\n \n I'm not sure what thread or posts you are talking about, IANGB.

After all it is not my claim that all zygotes are human beings / \"persons.\" Agree? Also, I want to make it clear that I am arguing only for the most basic of human rights (life) and not for the full panopoly of rights that say an adult human individual would have.\n \n \n Feel free to repeat any prior arguments you've made, Chuz; I welcome this thread as the 'start anew' you suggested elsewhere.

Instead, though, I can post a brief few arguments of my own.\n \n Firstly: the statement you are trying to support is \"Biologically speaking, a human individual's life begins at conception\". However, the word 'life' - that which you are arguing has a factually determinable beginning, does not have an absolute biological definition. To quote the wikipedia article on it: \"It is still a challenge for scientists and philosophers to define life in unequivocal terms\". This is doubly the case when considering the 'life' of an individual, as opposed to the 'life' of, say, a skin cell. For example, a person with no brain activity can be composed of living cells if they are kept on life support, but legally and medically the individual is considered dead.\n \n The argument, then: If 'life' has no definitive definition, how can you argue that it has a clearly definable start?\n \n Secondly: Consider a zygote. According to you, it is an individual. But a zygote can split into two - to form monozygotic, or 'identical', twins. Before splitting, it is one 'individual'. Afterwards, it is two. Where has the extra individual come from? Given that the split can happen up to 15 days after fertilisation, when was the start of that individuals life?\n \n Thirdly: In contrast to identical twins, consider a chimera organism. A chimera is made up of cells containing one of two different strands of human DNA - they are formed when two fertilised eggs or early embryos collide and become one embryo, which then goes on to be a single human being. Given that the single individual was created by the merging of two different individuals (by your definition), when was the biological start of their life?",

If in the end you still do not agree with or share my conclusions,.... you must know that-that in itself will negate neither my conclusions nor the facts that I support my conclusions with.\nIndeed, although I'd add in the bolded text. I don't think we have an issue here; I was talking about 'my assumptions', you were talking about 'your conclusions', but we both had the same thing in mind.\n \n \nMy preference would be that we conduct the debate in a Question and Answer \"interview\" styled format.

At the moment, even if you have rebuttals for my current three arguments, there is nothing which supports your statements - my three are arguments against, disproving them does not count as an argument for. Burden of proof, etc.\n \n After reading the rest of your post... it's possible we're talking about different things but using the same words. By asking you to post your 'arguments', I mean 'the methods by which you have arrived at your conclusion'. I can then 'rebut' those arguments by (attempting to) find methodological (and just plain logical) flaws in your ideas. However, I've beaten you to the punch and launched my own 'arguments' first - these do not counter your methods (because you have yet to explain them), but instead attack your conclusion directly. You're in the process of rebutting them.\n \n Sorted? Again, I don't think we have an issue here. Onwards to the debate!\n \n \nI simply don't share your premise [that 'life' is insufficiently defined].\n \n In fact, the link that you provided undermines your own (quoted) basis as it continues and says in the very next sentence; \"Any definition must be sufficiently broad to encompass all life with which we are familiar, and it should be sufficiently general that, with it, scientists would not miss (even) life that may be fundamentally different from earthly life.\"\n \n That's pretty dang broad!\n \n Your own citation attempts to correct the narrowminded thinking in the one line that you have selected for your basis.\nI don't think that quote 'attempts to correct' the thinking, I think it is simply explaining why 'life' is such a difficult term to define. The term needs to be massively broad, but at the same time specific enough to eliminate things like 'fire' - this proves a problem. The final definition provided by the article - 'an organism that exhibits all or most of the following phenomena' remains vague: how much is 'most'? 50%? 90%?\n \n \nWhen I make the claim; \"biologically speaking a human individual's life begins at conception.\" I am not assigning anything more to that new life than the fact that they are human organism, that they are alive, and that their specific (individual) life began at their (specific) individual conception.\nI'm not sure I see how this is relevant. The split up claim still requires a definition for 'life', for both the second and third parts of the claim (and possibly the first, depending on how you use the dictionary). We can go into the evidence you have for each of the three parts when it's your turn to 'be interviewed', but for now...\n \n If you consider 'life' to be a acceptably-defined term: how would you define it?",

   "I've split your post into parts and then rearranged the first few to parts to give my own post some flow. I suggest you read the lot rather than approaching it one bit at a time, as there's a shortcut through this particular argument suggested halfway through the post.\n \nExisting definitions and other sources (including the one you linked to) combined with the biological facts that animals (including humans) pass on life from one generation to another and must do so without breaking the life cycle are sufficient for me to conclude that a zygote is alive.\n \n QUOTE; \"The human life cycle begins at fertilization, when an egg cell inside a woman and a sperm cell from a man fuse to form a one-celled zygote.\"\n \n My conclusion that an individual human zygote is alive from the moment of conception is based upon all these facts and more, Iangb. The sources range from dictionaries, to links like the one you provided and even acknowledgments by the likes of Planned Parenthood.\n\n So, in fact, you have given a definition to 'life'. You have defined 'life' implicitly, as 'anything that is part of a life cycle'.\n \n Technically, you're entirely correct. I'm not denying that the cell a zygote is made of is 'alive', nor have I ever done so - it's provably a living cell. What I am trying to do is distinguish between a 'life' in the context of a cell (which a zygote is), and a 'life' in the context of a person (which, my argument would be, it isn't). There's a big difference - for example, a corpse on life support can be composed mainly of living cells, but be entirely brain dead. In contrast, an alive person may have many dead cells as part of their body - dead skin cells, if nothing else. Furthermore, most of the cells in your body are younger than you are - most human cells live for less than ten years. You need to be talking about the period of life of the individual, not of the cells that make them up.\n \n In this case, you are most definitely talking about the life of a cell, not a person. The life cycle is defined as \"the continuous sequence of changes undergone by an organism from one primary form, as a gamete, to the development of the same form again.\" In short, the life cycle for humans includes sperm and unfertilised eggs - these are clearly not alive as 'individuals' (context:people), or you should be arguing against contraception as well as abortion.\n \n \nThat's just it, I don't \"define life\" Iangb.\n \n Neither do I (nor anyone else, IMO) need to 'define life' in order to conclude that an \"individual's\" life begins at the moment of their conception. \n\n That's simply not the case. You said it yourself in this thread; you can break the statement you are defending into three parts -\n \n 1. They are a human organism\n 2. They are alive\n 3. Their specific (individual) life began at their (specific) individual conception.\n \n In order to prove #2, you need to define 'life'.\n \n Having read through your posts a few times, I think I see a possible solution here. It's possible that all along you've been meaning your statement to say \"Biologically speaking a human individual's individuality begins at conception\". While that wouldn't remove the 'defining the life of an individual' problem completely, it would reduce it in importance significantly - part #2 would become \"they are an individual\" and part #3 would become \"their individuality began at their conception\".\n \n The other two arguments I've made so far deal with 'individuality'.\n \n \nAdult persons for example have a right to their life and to due process, etc. Correct? So, to acknowledge that fact, do you also pause to debate with yourself over what the definition of \"life\" is for adult persons as well?\nIn most cases, the question 'is an adult human alive' has been pretty much thoroughly exhausted - back before 1981. Even so, there are still some cases where the argument resurfaces.\n \n \nUnless you were to be looking for an angle to deny them their rights or personhood, I doubt that you do.\n \n In the 'Liar's Corner'; Iangb, you posted; \"I've maintained since coming here that I would be as intellectually honest as possible - for example, I've pointed out several times when something I've discovered actually works against what I've been arguing at the time.\"\n \n Remember?\n \n So, please tell me how you consider it to be 'intellectually honest' when you deny something as simple as 'whether a human zygote is alive' even as you are faced with such an abundance of evidence; evidence that a human zygote IS biologically \"alive\" from the moment of it's conception, on. \n \nWhatever happened to being 'as anti-antagonistic as possible'?

I posted it only to remind you so that you would (hopefully) maintain that standard as you considered the links, definitions and arguments that I presented here and will be presenting here in the future.\n \n So far, you seem to be a man of your word.\n \n Feel free to remind me (whever you feel necessary) that I claim to be intellectually honest as well. \n \n ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n \n {Chuz} in fact, you have given a definition to 'life'. You have defined 'life' implicitly, as 'anything that is part of a life cycle'.\n\n \n I think you are getting the word \"application\" confused with the word \"implication\" Iangb. That so many definitions of the word \"life\" and or \"alive\" are applicable to \"every living thing\" and that human zygotes are a part of that group is not an \"implication\" that a human zygote is alive. It's a biological fact. A biological fact that you finally agreed to; in the post I'm now responding to.\n \n You said; \n Technically, you're entirely correct. I'm not denying that the cell a zygote is made of is 'alive', nor have I ever done so - it's provably a living cell. \n\n \n And then you added; \n What I am trying to do is distinguish between a 'life' in the context of a cell (which a zygote is), and a 'life' in the context of a person (which, my argument would be, it isn't). There's a big difference - for example, a corpse on life support can be composed mainly of living cells, but be entirely brain dead. In contrast, an alive person may have many dead cells as part of their body - dead skin cells, if nothing else. Furthermore, most of the cells in your body are younger than you are - most human cells live for less than ten years. You need to be talking about the period of life of the individual, not of the cells that make them up.\n\n \n Iangb, a human zygote is only one cell in size. Unlike your corpse on life support example or even your other examples, The entirety of a human zygote's 'life' is contained in that one cell. And I can't stress this point enough. \n \n The life that zygote is living is it's own. \n \n You have just acknowleged (above) that a human zygote is \"alive.\" Well tell me who's life (if not it's own) do you think it is living?\n \n Let's consider an amoeba. A single celled animal that will remain a single celled organism it's entire life. \n \n Please explain for me the argument for how an amoeba can be and is recognized as an individual organism living it's own life,... but that a newly conceived human being in the zygote stage of their life and development is somehow something less.\n \n \n In this case, you are most definitely talking about the life of a cell, not a person.\n\n \n The purpose of this debate, Iang was a challenge for me to show that 'a human being's life biologically begins at conception.' You lead off with specific questions about the biological definitions of \"life.\" So, I obliged and have been posting links and comments about the zygote's life. All of this is still headed towards my defending my ultimate point that conception also biologically begins the \"person's\" life. \n \n A human zygote is only one cell in size, Iangb,... (though it doesn't stay that small very long.) So, rest assured that I am talking about BOTH a zygote the single cell,... as well as the fact that the human zygote is a human individual being. (person)\n \n \n The life cycle is defined as \"the continuous sequence of changes undergone by an organism from one primary form, as a gamete, to the development of the same form again.\" In short, the life cycle for humans includes sperm and unfertilised eggs - these are clearly not alive as 'individuals' (context: people), or you should be arguing against contraception as well as abortion.\n\n \n Some people actually do 'argue against contraception as well as abortion, Iangb.' Though, I don't and hopefully as we go forward, you will understand why. \n \n \n You said it yourself in this thread; you can break the statement you are defending into three parts -\n \n 1. They are a human organism\n 2. They are alive\n 3. Their specific (individual) life began at their (specific) individual conception.\n \n In order to prove #2, you need to define 'life'.\n\n \n To which you just said; \n Technically, you're entirely correct. I'm not denying that the cell a zygote is made of is 'alive', nor have I ever done so - it's provably a living cell. \n\n \n We are not in disagreement on whether or not a human in the zygote stage of their life is \"alive,\" Iangb. \n \n We are in disagreement as to \"who's\" life it is living; and what rights if any does the human zygote have to that life it is living.\n \n ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n \n Having read through your posts a few times, I think I see a possible solution here. It's possible that all along you've been meaning your statement to say \"Biologically speaking a human individual's individuality begins at conception\". While that wouldn't remove the 'defining the life of an individual' problem completely, it would reduce it in importance significantly - part #2 would become \"they are an individual\" and part #3 would become \"their individuality began at their conception\".\n\n \n I have read through this comment of yours also (several times now) Iangb. \n \n And when I read it in light of your earlier comment;\n Technically, you're entirely correct. I'm not denying that the cell a zygote is made of is 'alive', nor have I ever done so - it's provably a living cell. \n It takes on a completely different meaning from what you likely intended.\n \n My position all along has been that a 'human beings life biologically begins at conception.' And here you have in just these two statements just about drawn (illustrated) the conclusions for me. You acknowledge that a zygote is one cell, that it's alive, that it comes about by conception, and now that it's individuality of sorts likewise has began (biologically) by *it's conception. You still have your caveot \"While that wouldn't remove the 'defining the life of an individual' problem completely,...\" But I have to say,... I do greatly respect you for the amount of intellectual honesty you have shown so far!\n \n Bravo!\n \n * (fyi, I would rather call a human zygote \"him/her\" and not an \"it\")",

(person)\nI'm going to have to clarify something for you here. Just as there is more than one 'type' of nail (fingernails and iron nails), there is more than one 'type' of life (cellular life and individual life, at the very least). Furthermore, just because something meets all the criteria for one type of 'life' does not mean that it automatically is both types - just as you don't have long iron rods growing out of your fingers. \n \n A zygote meets the criteria for the 'cellular' type of life. You have yet to properly define the criteria for the 'individual' type of life - all we know so far is that it does not match up wth the 'cellular' definition. For example; the 'life' on terms of cells does not include a 'who' in it's definition; skin cells, sperm cells etc. are all alive by cellular standards, but would you ask 'who's life is an individual sperm cell living'? Would you consider your arm to be an 'individual' in its own right?\n \nSome people actually do 'argue against contraception as well as abortion, Iangb.' Though, I don't\n\n I realise that they do, just as I realise that you don't agree with them. What I was trying to show here was that if you use your definition ('part of a life cycle') to refer to individual life, you should be agreeing with them. As you don't - clearly there must be something wrong with your argument, as it leads to inconsistencies.\n \n \nLet's consider an amoeba. A single celled animal that will remain a single celled organism it's entire life.\n \n Please explain for me the argument for how an amoeba can be and is recognized as an individual organism living it's own life,... but that a newly conceived human being in the zygote stage of their life and development is somehow something less.\nAn amoeba:\n Is independent from others: it eats and digests it's own food.\n Can reproduce: 'an amoeba' refers to one in any stage of it's life cycle, like 'a human'\n Has a complex system: If cut in half, the half that doesn't contain the nucleus will die\n \n A zygote does none of these things. A zygote is:\n Biologically reliant on the mother for nutrients and oxygen, having no way to absorb them itself\n Cannot reproduce without further development\n Has a 'holistic' (possibly the wrong term) system - if you separate the two cells of a newly-divided zygote, they may well become identical twins.\n \n A zygote is 'alive' in the same way that a sperm is 'alive' - it is entirely made of a living, human cell. That doesn't make it an individual.\n \n \nI have read through this comment of yours also (several times now) Iangb.\n \n And when I read it in light of your earlier comment; It takes on a completely different meaning from what you likely intended.\n \n My position all along has been that a 'human beings life biologically begins at conception.'

You still have your caveot \"While that wouldn't remove the 'defining the life of an individual' problem completely,...\"\nAgain, you appear to need clarification.\n \n I was not conceding a point here. I was attempting to do you a favour, true - but by suggesting an alternative solution to your particular problem that you cannot acceptably define 'the life of an individual'. I was not suggesting that 'individuality begins at conception', I was suggesting that this is what you should be arguing if you wish to avoid defining 'life' on an individuals terms. Furthermore, the very next line of my post reminded you that the other two arguments I made earlier dispute the idea that 'individuality begins at conception'.\n \n You can either define 'life' in terms of an individual organism and then show why a zygote matches that definition, or you can re-phrase your opening statement so that it refers to 'individuality' rather than 'life' - and then come back to the whole 'life' question later (if it hasn't been dealt with by proxy of your other arguments). Either way, you still have my other two arguments to deal with, plus whatever else I think/write up in the meantime. To re-state, though, for one last time:\n \n Just because a zygote is alive at a cellular level does not make it alive as an individual, in the same way that just because I have nails growing out of my fingers, this does not make my fingers iron-tipped.\n \n \n*(fyi, I would rather call a human zygote \"him/her\" and not an \"it\") \nHowever, a human's sex is not purely determined by their genes. A zygote does not have a fixed sex. 'It' is an 'it. \n Furthermore, 'he/she' implies individuality, which I don't agree with; why would I agree to undermine my own position every time I refer to what we are arguing about?",

   "I'll post this one bit here, as this particular part of the argument is starting to drag us in circles and I think I see a resolution to it which should umbrella over the entirety of your post. I'll then respond to all the individual bits of your post in the mirror thread, as I'd quite like to clarify my argument so far. If you don't like my proposition below, respond to it in this thread and if needed I'll port over my individual responses from the mirror thread, as they will suddenly have become relevant again.\n \n *******************************\n \n So far, we have argued two differing views. Note: 'differing' - not 'opposing'. I think we've been arguing at cross-purposes.\n \n Your argument so far has been that 'life' - no matter the context; be it cellular life, an individuals life or any other - is acceptable to fit the 'right to life' mentioned in the Constitution (as long there is a human element). Furthermore, a zygote has 'life', so it matches. Correct so far? I would guess you are planning on attempting to do the same to the other words from the 14th amendment, in order to show that a zygote fits the bill (pun only slightly intended) in all the other ways.\n \n My view as stated so far is that there are several definitions for 'life', just as there are several definitions of many words ('nail' and 'key', for example). More specifically, the two types of 'life' we have been discussing are the generic, catch-all definition (what I called 'cellular' life) and the life of a person/animal (what I called 'individual' life). My view was that while a zygote is provably alive by the 'cellular' definition, this did not prove it was a person: in order for you to do this, you must prove that a zygote has 'individual' life. Furthermore, I argued that you had yet to present an unequivocal definition for 'individual' life; all we had discovered so far is that it differs from 'cellular' life, because one can refer to sperm, skin cells etc and the other cannot.\n \n So... you've been trying to show that a zygote has 'life' by any definition, and I've been trying to show that this fact does not matter in the slightest as to whether a zygote is a person or not. I would say that we've both succeeded.\n \n At some point, I'll come back to your conclusions from the fact that the constitution \"doesn't specify what \"kind\" of life or level of life, etc\". However, that particular argument is better suited for later (unless you particularly want to hear it now, in which case let me know). For now, though... we've moved on to you trying to show that a zygote is an 'individual human being'. You have those two other arguments of mine as hurdles, too.\n \n Onwards!",

That so many definitions of the word \"life\" and or \"alive\" are applicable to \"every living thing\" and that human zygotes are a part of that group is not an \"implication\" that a human zygote is alive. It's a biological fact. A biological fact that you finally agreed to; in the post I'm now responding to?\"\n \n I have no idea as to what you are driving at in your quote above, Iangb. If you had a point, I think you buried it.\n\n My point was this: for a large part of your post (#8) you had stated (falsely) that you didn't need to define 'life' in order to prove that a zygote was alive. You then provided your own evidence for the claim, stating that because a zygote is part of the life cycle, it must be alive. I simply responded that in order for this statement to be a valid piece of evidence, you must be implicitly defining 'life' as 'anything which is in a life cycle'.\n \n \nThe Constitution says that a person has a right to their life, Iangb. It doesn't specify what \"kind\" of life or level of life, etc. \n [snip]\n However, having proof read your following comments, I'll play along just so I can comment further.\nI would like to take this quite a lot further, as I suspect (like I just said in post #13) that this will be a recurring theme. However, I'd like to know your position first.\n Would I be right in saying that you would also state \"[the constitution] doesn't specify what kind of 'person'\", too? Ditto for 'individual'.\n \n \nA zygote meets the criteria for the 'cellular' type of life(1). You have yet to properly define the criteria for the 'individual' type of life (2) - all we know so far is that it does not match up wth the 'cellular' definition(3).\nYou do realize that you just contradicted yourself. Right? \nNo, I didn't. I stated (with reasons now added):\n 1. A zygote meets the criteria which you had provided for 'cellular' life - it is part of a life cycle.\n 2. You haven't said yet how to define 'individual' life - you haven't.\n 3. All we know about the definition for 'individual' life so far is that it is not the same as 'cellular' life - because 'cellular life' refers to sperm cells etc where as 'individual' life does not.\n I don't see the contradiction.\n \n \nNo. However, I would ask you; \"who's life is a human that is in the zygote stage of their life living?\"\n \n Indeed, I would also ask you; \"who's life is an amoeba living?\" \"Who's life is a tree living?\" A horse, dog, or camel? A tick, flea or lamprey? And on and on and on. Hopefully your answer would be consistent for all of them. \"They are living each their own lives.\"\n \n If you disagree, I think that we may have a lot more reason to stay focused on this aspect of the debate.\nThe question \"who's life is a human that is in the zygote stage of their life living?\" makes as much sense as the question \"who's life is a human that is in the sperm/egg stage of their life living?\". \n Either the (cellular) 'life' definition you have provided so far is one that you can ask the \"who's life it it anyway\" question of, or it isn't. If it is, you can ask it of both sperm/egg and zygote. If it isn't (which is the case), you need to show what sort of 'life' a zygote has that a sperm doesn't; you need to actually define what I've been calling 'individual' life.\n \n I realise that you don't agree with me that you've provided a definition for (cellular) life. Hopefully I've explained why that is the case above, I'll be doing so again in a few lines time. Even if that isn't the case though, substitute 'the (cellular) definition of life you are using', rather than 'the (cellular) definition of life you have provided' in the above paragraph. The point still stands.\n \n \nAgain, 'part of a life cycle' is not my argument any more than it is yours. It is your characterization of my argument. You yourself have acknowledged the biological fact that a human zygote is alive (even if it's only what you call cellular life.) Remember, my claim is that \"a human individual's life biologically begins at conception.\" If it begins at the cellular level and it has \"begun,...\" Do the math. The individual life has began.\n\n If 'part of the life cycle' is not your argument, then on what basis do you consider all of your links about the 'life cycle' in post #8 to be valid evidence?\n \n The only way for it to be so is if being part of the 'life cycle' is evidence that something is alive. In other words, you've defined at least one possible attribute of 'life' to be 'part of a life cycle'.\n \n I have acknowledged the fact that a zygote is alive, based on the definition of 'life' as 'something that is part of a life cycle'. I don't think it's a particularly bad definition, for 'cellular' life. If you have a better alternative, feel free to share.\n \n Furthermore, you readily agree that 'life' is a continuum, a cycle. The only way that 'a human individuals life begins at conception' is if:\n 1. The individual begins at conception (hence my attempt to reword your opening statement)\n 2. The zygote is 'individually' alive at that point (not 'cellularly' alive, the word individual in the sentence gives context to which definition of 'life' should be used).\n \n You have proven neither of these.\n \n \nIangb, you should know better than to think that a I was equating a human zygote and an amoeba. Can you not appreciate the difference between a comparison and and equation? \n\n Yes - an equation insists that they are identical, a comparison highlights their similarities and differences.\n You highlighted their similarities, I highlighted their differences. I also pointed out that those differences were significant enough to make a amoeba an individual organism, compared to a zygote, which is not.\n \n \nIn this comment, it seems we are stating (or-restating) some common ground that I would like to explore a little bit further before we move onto the \"individuality\" aspects.

And (2) that it is an entity in and of itself (made up entirely of a living human cell).\n \n Thus we refer to it as \"A\" human zygote.

But to show you how I begin the basis for my claim that it is (biologically speaking) a human individual.

   " Would I be right in saying that you would also state \"[the constitution] doesn't specify what kind of 'person'\", too? Ditto for 'individual'.\n\n \n No. Again, I would rather you ask me specific questions about my position than to speculate and try to re-cast it in ways that you feel you can better argue against. What you have been attempting to do with twisting my posts is called a strawman fallacy.\n \n \nI don't see the contradiction. \n\n \n That's ok, minor point,... moving on.\n \n [QUOTE=iangb;361760] The question \"who's life is a human that is in the zygote stage of their life living?\" makes as much sense as the question \"who's life is a human that is in the sperm/egg stage of their life living?\".\n \n Well that's kind of the main point of contention between us, isn't it? The problem (problem - for lack of a better word) that you are having is due to the fact that you do not recognize a human zygote (nor any zygote, aparently) as an organism. Once you accept and recognize a human zygote (or any zygote for that matter) as a seperate organism, you will better understand why a zygote is a \"who\" and a Gamete is just a \"potential\" organism. \n \n \n Either the (cellular) 'life' definition you have provided so far is one that you can ask the \"who's life it it anyway\" question of, or it isn't. If it is, you can ask it of both sperm/egg and zygote. If it isn't (which is the case), you need to show what sort of 'life' a zygote has that a sperm doesn't; you need to actually define what I've been calling 'individual' life.\n\n \n Honestly, Iangb..... Even though a human zygote is an individual organism and gametes cells are not,.... it's not inapporpriate to ask \"who's life is a sperm cell living?\" or \"who's life is a human zygote living?\" The sperm cell is living it's own life as a reproductive cell and the zygote is living its life as a newly developing organism.\n \n The word \"whose\" is that broadly applicable. \n \n Also, in posting that link I may have discovered part of the reason for the confusion. I have been using the word \"who's\" when I should have been using the word \"whose.\"\n \n \"Whose life is a sperm cell living?\" \"Whose life is a zygote living?\" Etc.\n \n Does that help clear anything up?\n --------------------------------------\n \n \n If 'part of the life cycle' is not your argument, then on what basis do you consider all of your links about the 'life cycle' in post #8to be valid evidence?\n\n \n On what basis? I don't know what you mean by that. I offered the link to the human life cycle as supportive information. Thus my comment; 'Existing definitions and other sources (including the one you linked to) combined with the biological facts that animals (including humans) pass on life from one generation to another and must do so without breaking the life cycle are sufficient for me to conclude that a zygote is alive.'\n \n I'll note now that you have dwelled incessantly on the \"life cycle/ cellular life\" link,.... but that you have completely ignored the other link to Planned parenthood's glossary whic states;\n \n zygote\n The single-celled organism that results from the joining of the egg and sperm. \n \n That's from Planned Parenthood's Glossary, Iangb.\n \n Let's review Planned parenthood's definitions for Sperm and Eggs, shall we?\n \n sperm #\n The reproductive cells in men, produced in the seminiferous tubules of the testes. \n \n egg\n The reproductive cell in women; the largest cell in the human body.\n \n I'll remind you again that we are both touting ourselves as \"intellectually honest\" posters, Iangb. You should have no problem appreciating the fact that these definitions are coming from Planned Parenthood's website. You know who Planned Parenthood is, don't you? \n \n ---------------------------------------------\n \n \n you readily agree that 'life' is a continuum, a cycle. The only way that 'a human individuals life begins at conception' is if:\n 1. The individual begins at conception (hence my attempt to reword your opening statement)\n 2. The zygote is 'individually' alive at that point (not 'cellularly' alive, the word individual in the sentence gives context to which definition of 'life' should be used).\n \n You have proven neither of these.\n\n \n I have provided you with quotes and definitions from no less than Planned Parenthood themselves. I can flood this page with a huge variety of links to other sources if you like, Iangb. But I thought the one that you would heed first (above all others) would be Planned Parenthood's.\n \n Planned Parenthood's definitions support my claims for BOTH your comments above. 1; That the individual \"organism\" begins at conception and 2; that the zygote is living \"individually.\" (a seperate and distinguishable life from it's mother) \n \n You have received \"proof\" Iangb. If you demand more, I am willing and able to provide it.\n \n ---------------------------------------------\n \n \n I also pointed out that those differences were significant enough to make a amoeba an individual organism, compared to a *zygote, which is not.\n -*Link added by me\n \n It will be interesting to see if you are willing to reconsider after reading the definitions from Planned Parenthood. And again, I can provide more if that's what you require.\n \n ------------------------------------------\n \n \n Now lets apply the same rational to a human sperm cell.\n A sperm is alive: it's a living cell that is part of the life cycle\n A sperm is a human: if not, what else is it?\n A sperm is an individual: A sperm.\n \n Seeing as it is the male sperm which carries the X or Y chromosome, you could even insist on calling them 'he' or 'she'...\n \n What is it about the sperm which disqualifies it from the 'alive human individual' club, if those are the criteria which you use?\n\n \n Just as you yourself and Planned Parenthood have pointed out, Iangb. \n \n A Sperm Cell is just that; a \"cell.\"\n \n A Zygote is a living organism.\n \n That's the difference. And that (this) is the basis for my statement; \"Biologically speaking, a human individual's life begins at conception.'\n \n --ChuzLife!",

Would you consider your arm to be an 'individual' in its own right?\nNo\nIf you are bolding two questions (indicating that you are answering both of them) and your response is 'No', how should I know that you actually mean \"Yes to the first question, no to the second\"?\n \n We now have an extra criteria you've introduced - an 'alive human individual' must be an organism.

From 2. and 3. you get one more - 'life' must be a property of an animal' - and a re-enforcement of 'life cycle'.\n \n All of these implied definitions are implied because they must be true, otherwise the definitions mean nothing to your argument. I could say \"But a zygote must be alive, it starts with a 'z'\" - the only way this would be valid evidence is 'life' was defined as 'a property of words starting with a z'.\n \n The rest of the bits of your post deal with evidence that a zygote is an organism.

That doesn't necessarily make them accurate - and if you look for long enough on the internet, you can find a source which says pretty much whatever you want it to.

That pretty much implies that a zygote is not an organism.\n \n in-post edit: I found a definition for you which gets a bit closer; the Encyclopedica Britannica says \"The zygote represents the first stage in the development of a genetically unique organism.\" However, this still doesn't make it an organism. Cake mix is a stage in the development of a tasty cake, but that doesn't make it one. \n \n Lets look at it another way - and define 'organism'.

Come and get it!\n \n RNAi and expression of retrotransposons MuERV-L and IAP in preimplantation mouse embryos.\n Everone knows what that means, right?\n \n <snipped for brevity< These results suggest that RNAi constrains expression of repetitive parasitic sequences in preimplantation embryos, and thereby contributes to preserving genomic integrity at a stage of development when the organism consists of only a few cells. Dept. of Biology, University of Penn.\nFirstly: if this is the second strongest bit of evidence from the 'huge variety of links to other sources' you claimed to have back in post #17, this backs up the suspicion I voiced in post #20; you are more reliant on the planned parenting glossary than you would like to admit. This article is an incredibly technical piece with a single phrase which you have highlighted; it's one of the few phrases in the whole abstract which is entirely comprehensible - I can guess at what it's talking about, but only just. Out of interest, how did you find it?\n \n Secondly: The phrase - \"a stage of development when the organism consists of only a few cells.\" - still does not suggest that a zygote is an organism. A zygote is a single cell, the phrase is talking about more than one.\n \n Thirdly - and very minor (this is part of my ramble, to be honest): The whole article is discussing mouse embryos/blastocysts, not human ones. While this may not seem important, let me introduce you to something I came across earlier today and found interesting: parthogenesis. Parthenogenesis is \"an asexual form of reproduction found in females where growth and development of embryos occurs without fertilization by a male.\" While this hasn't been observed naturally occurring in mammals, it has been induced in a rabbit, and a 'fatherless mouse' has been created. It has also been observed to naturally occur in animals such as sharks.\n This certainly doesn't affect the 'a zygote is an organism' argument. However, it does show that mammalian 'life' (if not yet human) can be created without a standard 'conception/fertilisation'. This (apart from being quite interesting) further supports the 'fuzzy' definition of the start of an individual's life and associated definitions. Nothing is absolute.\n \n ***********************************\n \n More on-topic rambling: I went a-searching for evidence that a zygote was an organism. The first hit on a google search for 'zygote organism' made for very interesting reading. I did some more research on the site, and came up with two follow-up threads (the three to be read in that order).\n \n What we have here, then, is an expert who firmly states that a zygote is not definable as an organism, nor is it \"considered an individual Homo sapiens by any members of the scientific community that I know\".\n We also have another expert (without the credentials page - see his to the left side of the text) who considers a zyote to be an organism. While I would probably argue with him on that (he seemed to vary his definition between 'potential' and 'individuality' that was never quite consistent) - his end comments are also quite significant. The game we are playing has so far been an almost purely semantic one - and as such, it is as subjective as any use of language can be.\n \n I would be interested to see Dr. Wolpe's reply to your email, regardless of it's contents. However, his response will be as 'absolute' as Dana's or Eugene's - likely to be supporting evidence only, unless he goes into a significant amount of detail. \n \n Finally for this post, I'd like to remind you that 'defining a zygote as an organism' is only a small part of this overall debate. There are several other arguments on the boil here - not least of which are my own ones from back in post #4, which are unique amongst the arguments so far in this thread in that they are not semantic in nature, but deal with factual observations that an 'individual' zygote can become two (or, technically, more) 'individual people'. Even if you were to irrefutably prove that a zygote can currently be defined as an individual, you would still have to overcome these arguments, lest your newly-proven definition be rendered inconsistent - and when a definition and observations conflict, I'd say that it is the definition which must change.",

   "Dr. Wolpe's response; On 7/23/09 4:10 PM\n \n \n --Chuz\n \n I do not want to get enmeshed in this iteration of this debate, a debate that has gone on for decades or more without resolution. I have weighed in on this issue many times, and it has been debated endlessly by people making the same points you and Ian have. There is nothing new in your arguments or Ian's. I applaud your desire to engage this issue, and it is a worthwhile intellectual exercise if you would rather do that then watch TV, but in my experience, not a single time has anyone ever convinced someone on the other side that they are wrong. So what's the point?\n \n But you asked for my two cents, so here it is: The argument has no solution because it mixes up biological and philosophical concepts. There is NO BIOLOGICAL ANSWER to the question \"when does an individual's life begin\" because it is not a biological question. That is why, in this debate, you have never adequately answered (in fact, you have very clearly avoided answering) Ian's question about the implications of splitting or converging of embryos. You have avoided it because it is a fatal flaw in your argument. It is also, incidentally, a flaw in Ian's. That is, it neither proves nor refutes the idea that an embryo is an individual, because everything depends on how you decide to define an individual. If you define an individual as a potentially transitory status, an embryo can be an individual even if it later splits into two individuals; if you define it as a permanent status (once you are an individual you are never two individuals or less than one individual until you die) then the early embryo is not an individual. But the answer is the philosophical approach to individuality, not the nature of the embryo.\n \n That mistake is made over and over again in this debate, and you make it consistently (as does Ian, though quite frankly, a lot less than you do) in the debate. An embyo is neither a person nor not-a-person, it is neither an individual nor not-an-individual. It is what it is, and then we impose meaning on that. Sperm is alive, ova are alive, the embryo is alive. That is biologically true, given almost any definition of life. But \"individual\" is not a biological concept (eg, jellyfish) and so debating on whether the living embryo is an \"individual\" life is biologically meaningless. And that is why we cannot reach a conclusion about it and why no one ever convinces anyone else.\n \n With that, I will withdraw from this debate. I will not answer objections or rebuttals you send, but you asked for my 2 cents, and that it is.\n \n Paul Root Wolpe\n",

Defining something as \"a DEVELOPING organism\" is clearly not defining it as an organism, any more than defining a planted acorn as a developing tree is defining it as a tree. I also did not say my word was truth, I said about the definition I gave \"I believe it is closer to the truth.\" Two examples where you seem unable to understand nuanced difference, and where your ideological position, rather than reasoned logic, drives your response. That is why I do not care to engage these discussions.\n \n My last word: Why should I care what Planned Parenthood's definition is and why do you keep harping on it? I have absolutely no relationship to PP's definition of the zygote, am not on their payroll, and feel no need or desire for them to change their definition. I advise them occasionally. And in my opinion, whether you call a zygote an organism or not, in fact, whether you call a zygote an individual or not, is irrelevant to abortion, stem cells, or any of the things that are really at issue.\n \n PRW\n",

So, I will only post my last to him. It should give you an idea of the exchange went and how my summary will be supported.\n \n \n; Dr. Wolpe,\n \n I thought that you are not interested in debating with me. If you have changed your mind, that's fine with me. I will try to answer your questions, defend my claims, etc. (either here or in a more public forum) As I said before, I would rather debate someone like you than most others. (your past e-mail as an example) I think you bring a lot more to the table.\n \n That being said, I have some disagreement with some of your claims too.\n \n For example, you cited two sources to support your claim that a zygote is not an organism;\n \n 1: zygote - definition of zygote by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia. } of a zygote:\n \n 2: Biology: species membership, definition of organism, testable hypothesis } and it will perfectly clarify my position.\n \n Your first source indicates near the bottom; \"zygote - (genetics) the diploid cell resulting from the union of a haploid spermatozoon and ovum (including the organism that develops from that cell)\"\n \n I suspect that you read the definition only far enough to see that it (might)fit your re-conceived notion or idealistic wants for the outcome.\n \n Your second source, Your cited Dr. Krempels actually admits; \"It (a zygote) might fit the first (definition for organism), but that one is a very general, inclusive definition.\"\n \n Dr. Wolpe, let me ask you,... how many definitions must be met in order for a word to apply? As you (yourself) suggested even in an earlier post.. (between a (sic) fish and a leafy thing.... you can select the most fitting definition for a tree)\n \n If a definition is \"inclusive\" and the parameters are met. The definition is applicable, even if only on the most semantic level.\n \n Of course, in light of your own reference (cite #1 above) in conjunction with the definitions posed to Dr. Krempels,... (citation #2); The determination that a zygote is in fact an organism is not only getting to be easier and easier to make. But it is getting to be easier to defend as well.\n \n Your \"apples and oranges\" comparison of an acorn to a zygote not withstanding, Dr. I think I can now better defend my position than before our exchange.\n \n Are you sure you want to continue?\n \n --Chuz\"\n\n \n In light of Dr. Wolpe's departure from the exchange, I'll now be incorporating much of his input to my summary and with full credit where credit is due going to him.",

   "I realise I am not Dr. Wolpe, and I realise that you are currently writing a summary of your position. However, I see no point in letting you believe you have a point to use (especially if you want your summary to be a closing statement) when there is an obvious answer to it.\n \n You provided two bits of 'evidence' that a zygote is an organism in your latest posted email.\n \n Firstly was the dictionary definition. Your quote was \"zygote - (genetics) the diploid cell resulting from the union of a haploid spermatozoon and ovum (including the organism that develops from that cell)\"\n \n This was no different from the principle definition that Dr Wolpe gave, from the top of the page:\n zy\u00b7gote (zgt)\n n.\n 1. The cell formed by the union of two gametes, especially a fertilized ovum before cleavage.\n 2. The organism that develops from a zygote.\n \n Bold added by me in both cases. As Dr Wolpe stated, this definition simply re-enforces that a zygote is not an organism - to quote him: \"\n Note that it suggests and (-sic-) organism develops from a zygote, not that the zygote is an organism.\"\n \n Your second piece of evidence was a quote from Dana. It was \"It (a zygote) might fit the first (definition for organism), but that one is a very general, inclusive definition.\"\n There are at least two separate responses to this.\n 1. Dana said 'might', not 'does'. This doesn't state that a zygote matches the definition, nor does it describe how it matches the description. You need to show both of these - simply showing that someone has said 'it might be possible' is hardly conclusive.\n 2. Your following argument was that 'if a zygote can match any definition of the word, then it is an organism'. However, this is not the case: we have already specified 'biologically speaking' as the context. Otherwise, the government (see definition #3) has the right to life.\n \n Carry on!",

   "Chuz is taking longer than anticipated, for whatever reasons he has. While I wait, I'll just post my summary: scavenged from the other thread, which is quickly disappearing to the second page.\n \n **********************************\n \n Chuz is currently writing a summary of his argument so far. I thought I'd make a summary of my own argument so far before viewing his, so that when I do I can see how much (if any) my response will change. This, then, is my summary of the thread so far. Format: To start with, I'm going to post Chuz's position and my own. Then I'll post my own arguments and Chuz's responses, then my responses to his responses and so on. I'll use a (hopefully intuitive) number-system that I'm making up as I go along to show which argument is which, so you can follow threads of an argument from start to end. Note that these are meant to summarise the arguments only, not the contents of each separate post, so I've skipped some of the more minor hiccups to keep it as short as possible. Note also: I've summarised all of this at the bottom of the post (for all those tl;dr-ers)\n \n Chuz's position: \"Biologically speaking, a human individual's life begins at conception\"\n Ian's position: \"Chuz's position is not provably true\"\n \n Ian's opening arguments:\n 1 A zygote can split up to 15 days after conception, resulting in identical twins. The idea that a zygote is a human individual ('a person') is directly contradicted by this fact: If a singlular zygote is a singluar person, where does the second twin come from, and when does it's life start?\n Chuz has not responded to this argument.\n 2 Two zygotes can merge to form a 'chimera' - a single person whose body is made up of cells containting one of the two DNA strands from the two zygotes. This fact directly contradicts the idea that a 'human individuals life starts at conception', unless Chuz wants to argue that it's possible for one individual to have two biological starts to their life.\n Chuz has not responded to this argument.\n 3 When proving that X=Y, the only way to do so is to define 'Y' and then show that X matches the definition (or vice versa). At the very least, Y must be defined 'implicitely': for example, I could say \"This must be an online debate, I'm typing it into a computer\", which would define an online debate as 'something which can be typed into a computer'. The definition of 'life' is not unequivocal, especially the life of an 'individual' as opposed to the life of something like a 'cell'. My contention is that Chuz cannot define 'life', so he cannot prove that a zygote is alive.\n \n Chuz responded with a statement of two parts:\n 3.1 You don't need to define 'Y' to prove that 'X=Y'. For example, when you define an adult as 'alive', do you question your definition every time you do so?\n 3.2 A zygote is provably alive based on these facts: the Wikipedia article on defining 'life', the planned parenthood article defining 'zygote', the biologyreference defining 'life cycle', the \"fact that animals (including humans) pass on life from one generation to another and must do so without breaking the life cycle\". There is overwhelming evidence that a zygote is alive.\n \n Ian responds again:\n 3.1.1 Yes, you do - there isn't any other way. The question 'is an adult alive' has been answered pretty exhaustively so is not often brought into question. However, there are some cases (generally euthanasia-related) where the argument is still being raised.\n Chuz has not responded to this argument\n 3.1.2 You have implicitely given several definitions for 'life' - for example, that something is alive if it is part of a life cycle.\n Chuz has not responded to this argument.\n 3.2 The definitions you have implied so far (see 3.1.2.) do, indeed, define a zygote as 'alive'. However, there is a difference between the life of an 'individual' (a person) and the life of 'a cell', as implied by my original post. I deny that a zygote is alive as an individual, not as a cell.\n \n Back to Chuz:\n 3.2.1 It doesn't matter which definition of 'life' you use, it isn't made specific in the constitution.\n 3.2.2 What makes a single-celled amoeba an individual organism, but a zygote is not considered as one?\n 4 I've shown that a zygote is alive (see 3.2), that it is a human (what else is it?) and that it is 'A' individual (it is 'an individual zygote'). That's the lot!\n \n And... Ian:\n 3.2.1 I'd like to respond to this, but first can you clarify part of your position for me: Assuming you managed to prove your opening position, on what basis does that show that a zygote is a 'person' as stated in the constitution?\n Chuz has not responded to this request for clarification, so Ian has not responded to Chuz's 3.2 argument, above.\n 3.2.2 An amoeba has several required characteristics which a zygote does not: it is independent, it can reproduce, part of it dies when it is cut in half (rather than forming two seperate cells)\n Chuz has not responded to this argument, beyond a refuted complaint that I was not 'comparing' a zygote and an amoeba.\n 4 By the definitions you have given, a sperm/egg cell is also an 'alive human individual', as is a skin cell. What makes a zygote different from these examples?\n \n Chuz:\n 4 A zygote is an organism. None of the others are. This is backed up by the planned parenthood definition of a zygote.\n \n Ian:\n 4.1 Planned parenthood is just one site - as it is contradicted by 4.2 and 4.3, it cannot be accurate\n 4.2 A zygote is not an organism - looking at the definitions for 'organism' gives no definition that describes a zygote.\n 4.3 A zygote is not an organism - the dictionary definitions for an zygote either implicitly or by absence deny that it is an organism.\n Chuz has not responded to this argument\n 4.4 At least one biology expert (Dana Krempels) has stated that a zygote is not an organism, nor would anyone she knows define it as one.\n 4.5 Another biology expert does consider a zygote to be biologically an organism; however, he distinguishes between the definition of the word and reality as it actually exists, making his definition useless to your general cause. This does, however, highlight my earlier arguments, 1 and 2, because they are the only non-semantic arguments here.\n Chuz has not responded to this argument.\n 4.6 How does 'organism' relate to the question 'is a zygote an alive human individual'? This is a case of special pleading: the actual conclusion you should be drawing is that your original definition (of an 'alive human individual') is wrong somewhere.\n Chuz has not responded to this argument.\n \n Chuz:\n 4.1.1 Let's see what a Planned Parenthood expert has to say on the matter...\n 4.1.2 Here is a scientific abstract which implies that a zygote is an organism\n 4.2 The dictionary definition for 'zygote' includes the word 'organism'\n 4.4 Dana says that a zygote \"might match the definition for an organism\"\n \n Dr Wolpe (PP expert):\n 4.1.1 I disagree with the PP definition.\n *unknown extras*\n \n Ian:\n 4.1.1 That's now two experts who share the same view that a zygote is not an organism, then\n 4.1.2 The article is about mouse embryos, not human zygotes. This is not evidence for your claim.\n 4.2 Yes, but only to indicate that an organism is what a zygote develops into - not evidence that a zygote is an organism.\n 4.4 Yes, but she doesn't say that it does, nor does she say how this would be the case. She also rejects the notion that it is a 'biological' definition, which is a necessary qualifier for your evidence.\n \n Chuz:\n Time to write my summary!\n \n *to be continued...*\n \n To summarise the summary: I am waiting for Chuz to respond to pretty much every end-point of every argument so far mentioned in this thread. My main questions/arguments at this point are:\n 1 & 2: How do you solve the contradiction provided by evidence, based (uniquely in this thread) on real observable facts rather than definitions, that a zygote is not an individual human?\n 3: How does an 'alive human individual' relate to the term 'person' in the constitution? If you clarify this for me, I can better answer your question: Does it matter which definition of 'life' we use? \n 4: What evidence do you have that a zygote is an organism? How does this help you prove that a zygote is an alive human individual?\n \n I need to write a response to Chuz's use of various definitions: 'life' in the cellular form, possibly his use of 'person' (depending on what clarification he provides for question #3), his use of 'individual' without any context (to clarify my argument #4.6). I shall do so when we return to the argument proper.\n \n ...Like I said, Chuz, please feel free to comment on anything in here. I realise that my summary of the summary is fairly harsh on you - but I'm just telling it how I see it. If you disagree, let me know.\n \n ******************\n \n I'll comment on Chuz's summary when he lets me know that it's finished. I don't see much new in there so far, but time will tell...",

   "@Chuz: Seeing as your 'summary/new argument' post hasn't been updated in well over three months, despite a plethora of new posts in other areas from you, I will assume that you have lost interest in this thread, as previous posts of yours have indicated.\n \n As such, I'll write a closing argument based on what you've got.

As my previous summary shows, there are a lot of areas where he started a line of reasoning, only to abandon it later. The thread itself ended up circling back on itself, with Chuz finally attempting to provide some quotations from scientific journals, books etc that supported the statement \"a human individual's life begins at conception\", rather than further develop any of his prior arguments. Looking at the links he's provided so far, many are not relevant, or are only relevant if interpreted in a certain way.

The challenge states 'biologically speaking' - implying that there is a scientific consensus on the statement. Chuz's excerpts, on the other hand, only show that the statement is supported by the scientists who wrote it - none of them indicate anything about a consensus. Furthermore, both myself and Chuz have evidenced first-hand views of scientists who do not support the statement - and go so far as directly rejecting it. This implies that, as both the Wikipedia article on 'life' and The Court in Roe vs Wade stated, there is no scientific consensus on when the life of an individual human being begins.\n \n There was also one other problem with Chuz's claim itself, which I mentioned in my opening arguments and was never addressed. To repeat it here - if a zygote is considered to be a 'human individual' (context: person) then how can a zygote become two 'individuals', or two zygotes later merge into one 'individual'?\n \n To close, then: Chuz has failed on two counts. Firstly, he has failed to provide evidence that there is a scientific consensus on the starting point of the life of a person ('a human individual'). Secondly, he has failed to provide sufficient evidence that this point lies at conception - especially given that there are both scientists who disagree with this point and logical problems that arise if you treat the point as the correct one.\n \n **********************\n \n I welcome any responses from anyone else - be it a comment on how this thread went, or your own arguments for either side. The 'commentary' thread is here, for anyone who wishes to use it. I hope you found this as interesting to read as I found it to write!\n \n ~iangb",

   "@Chuz: Seeing as your 'summary/new argument' post hasn't been updated in well over three months, despite a plethora of new posts in other areas from you, I will assume that you have lost interest in this thread, as previous posts of yours have indicated.\n \n As such, I'll write a closing argument based on what you've got. Like I said, I thought it was just getting interesting, and I feel like it should be suitably finished off.\n\n \n Ian, I still have plenty of interest in this debate. However, I haven't made this debate a priority for several reasons. The main reason is the one I shared with you before,... Namely your unwillingness to consider any points being made. After that, JP said that he might be interested in moderating the debate.... and then that fizzled.\n \n I've been busy with a lot of other things... But I still intend to participate here if we can either get a moderator or whenever there seems to be a genuine interest in the outcome. I would like to eventually get to your comments about twinning and all (for example)... But not unless or untill we have an agreement on the moment of when everyone elses life begins.",
