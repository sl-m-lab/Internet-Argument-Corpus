   "Well, I was trying to be good. I went to all that trouble to post start a couple of thread about things that I thought were interesting and would be of interest to creationists. I mean, YECs love to talk about Noah's ark. What seems to be the problem? Are they studying up on marine engineering and the physics of wood? Possibly they are studying the principles of sailing.\n \n And the thread about Oklo should be quite interesting. It shouldn't cause any problems for YECs, should it? Why, I didn't even mention that plutonium has, in fact, been found at Oklo. It was Pu-244 and through special efforts it was found in trace amounts. The half life of Pu-244 is 80 million years, and it too, is produced by nuclear fission in uranium.\n \n And, of course, I tried to keep the discussion about lobe finned fish going by posting some information on their morphology. Surely lappster can come back with some reasonable explanation as to why the dominant form of fish during the late Devonian would not be able to survive. Perhaps Lappster is right. They disappeared in only a few hundred million years (well, except for the coelacanth and the tetrapods).\n \n I'm sure that the creationists are consulting their Bibles for the answers.",

He/she just hasn't found anything that has already been written, that he can cut and paste to refute what you, or anybody else, says.\n \n Again, thats just my impression...",

It is not my problem if creationists have no answers. In fact, it is quite telling that creationists have no answer but recourse to miracles. Science is difficult and requires effort to understand.

   "It really doesn't take that much studying to understand most, if not all of what Lurch is saying. I'm just out of high school, and although I was a bit above average in it (6 AP courses for my last two years) it doesn't take too much study. Anyone with an interest, and a fairly capable mind can learn the basics of science, and the theories/hypotheses (sp?) they oppose/support. Also, one doesn't have to be a genius to understand the rules of debate, and that ad hominem attacks generally do not work (I think, there are very, very few cases in which they do work, but thats more of a hypothesis of mine. But they have no room in scientific discussion, so *shrug*) I've seen more and more ad hominem and preaching than suits my liking. But hey, I'm just a kid, and when the XXXX hits the fan, I'll leave it to those with degrees to do the fighting for science.",
