   "The story of Ireland's recent success, I believe is through the capitalistic measures that have been taken. \n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_Republic_of_Ireland\n \n http://www.economist.com/countries/Ireland/profile.cfm?folder=Profile-FactSheet\n \n http://www.cato.org/dailys/04-21-03.html\n \n All these sites have in them the same phrases like, \"reducing regulation,\" \"lower taxes,\" and \"maintaining low inflation.\" Sounds like capitalism at work to me. The less government is involved, the better. And on the economist.com factsheet, you can see that GDP per head is on the rise meaning the overall standard of living is rising. None of the articles make much mention of this little fact either but the people of Ireland are now staying in Ireland. There was negative population growth for a long time because there was no opportunity or incentive to stay so the younger people were leaving. Now, there is positive population growth and the people are staying. Their taxes are significantly lower than many European nations while they are running a near balanced budget. Sounds like they have found a more optimal point on the Laffer Curve to me. This is my take on the situation in Ireland and I would be curious to see who agrees/disagrees with me and why. Please respond.",

   "You missed the bits about huge quantities of EU subsidy then, I take it? Basically Ireland is more of a textbook case of the effectiveness of Keynesian economic theories, with the added benefit that Ireland doesn't have to pay a lot of the money back.\n\n \n Sure they got a little jump start, but they aren't giving it all up and becoming socialist like the rest of the EU. EU is trying to get all kinds of more capitalism minded nations with them. They are reaching to the Eastern Eurpoean countries to get them to participate in the EU because they are actually making money. Even though they still have huge markets, countries like France and Germany are not near as effective in the modern markets as Ireland relatively speaking. No one wants to open up in those countries because they'd have to pay enormous taxes. And why can't they lower their taxes? Because being a socialist country requires that you spend every penny you have on cradle to grave insurance and permanent job insurance and other such ridiculous measures. Ireland is no longer hemorraging their younger generations like they have been in the past either, and why? Because Ireland has become an economic hot bed and not solely due to the subsidies, but mainly through the influx of big companies wanting to be there for the low tax burdens. You think if we cancelled the debt to Africa, that would end the Brain Drain? No. The debt would just run back up and people would still be leaving but that is not the case in Ireland.",

   "It's called \"priming the pump\". Large quantities of money flowed into Ireland from Germany and the UK (among others) via the EU, much of it spent on infrastructure projects. Infrastructure projects have a massive multiplier effect on any money going into them. Also, a big part of Ireland's success has been due to government spending on education - a well educated work force is what attracted the likes of Intel to Ireland.\n \n If African nations had the same circumstances Ireland had - vast quantities of free money, a tarrif-free market available to exporters with 300 million consumers a short boat ride away, then sure they'd be as successful. Don't forget that most economies are built on protectionism - that's how South Korea and most of the Asian tigers got to be powerful. I've yet to see a single example of a country managing to build home-grown industry from scratch in a free market context.",
