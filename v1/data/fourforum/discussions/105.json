   "I saw this on another website I frequent (www.creationtalk.com) and it was just so perfect I had to use it. Go to this website and take the \"quiz,\" I realize it is a parady, and please don't be offended. But it illustrates my point sooo well. The Bible doesn't explicitly say all the things that the quiz says it does, but it says some of them...about thunderstorms, rainbows, etc. It never mentions what we now accept as the scientific fact about them. Does that mean that the biblical accounts are correct and the scientific explanations are wrong. Can you tell me that you don't believe that rainbows are caused by light refracting off of water molecules. Please don't be close minded about this and come back at me with a bunch of Bible verses that I have heard before. I am trying to make a point. If the Bible explains THESE things one way, and we understand them scientifically in another, does that mean one must be wrong and they can't coexist??? I don't think so. Why can't evolution and science coexist...just think about it.",

I'd have to mull it over. \n \n Yeah it is a pretty interesting experience having contradictory beliefs within your own mind. From what I have read of your other posts you focus a lot on whether things could have possibly evolved on their own, and whether or not evolution has everything explained or not. Well try looking at it differently. Instead of questioning the ability of random evolution, just keep ID (intelligent design) in mind. I am not saying go straight to combining eovlution and CHristianity, but just don't let your inability to accept random evolution from allowing you to accept facts. Just take in the facts you are given and don't worry whether or not evolution has it all right, becasue I tell you right off, they don't. They are always changing things and making new discoveries. But that doesn't mean they are all wrong. I suggest you take the things that evolution CAN prove. (I.e. old Earth, fossil records showing apparent evolution, modern survival of the fittest etc.) and work it out in your own mind. That is the best way. You shoulld never just take everythign someone says as fact. Take what they can prove to you as fact and put it to use into your own understanding. Just because something isn't all right doesn't mean it is all wrong.",
