However to the french and the allies, they were freedom fighters. fighting a legitamate war of resistence against the illegal invader, they were not seen as terrorist.\n \n I can use dozens of such examples from various occupied WW2 countries that are exactly the same.\n \n another example, mujahadeen, to the soviets, terrorists, to the west, they were freedom fighters.\n \n Northern ireland, the IRA, to the irish, freedom fighters, to the british, terrorists. I think you may be getting my point by now. \n \n So to the middle east, pallestinians are they terrorists? Or are the israelis terrorists? Are the iraqis fighting U.S occupation terrorists, in my opinion no they are not, because they are fighting for what they believe to be a moral and just cause, they are fighting for there freedom.\n \n In other words, a terrorist is what you call your enemy, who has a different belief, and who is fighting an unconventional war.\n \n What do other peole think of this?",

Al-Qaeda uses hijacked aircraft to kill innocent human beings.\n \n \nRemember the shock and awe bombing of iraq at the atart of the iraqi invasion, wasnt that terror tactics?\n\n \n In a way, yes. But consider how we did it. Precision-guided munitions, dropped on Baghdad targets necessary to decimate the abilitary of the Iraqi military to fight, for the purpose of minimizing further necessary combat. Ask youself what someone with an al-Qaeda mindset and American weapons invading Iraq would have done? BLU-82 bombs dropped directly onto Baghdad, killing tens of thousands in one blast. They wouldn't pick and choose targets like we did, they would just bomb Baghdad without discrimination.\n \n Here's my definitions of freedom fighter and terrorist.\n \n Freedom fighter- A person who, as the name suggests, is involved in a war to secure either their own or someone else's freedom. Most of the time this will involve guerilla tactics and asymmetrical warfare against enemy forces, with the ultimate goal of throwing off foreign rule and living in freedom.\n \n Terrorist- A person who fights against an enemy power, often times also using guerilla tacics and asymmetrical warfare. The difference is that a terrorist's aim is to kill and terrorize not only the enemy's forces, but to do this to their people as well, willfully targetting innocents and noncombatants to further goals which are often times not to secure freedom for anybody. A terrorist does not fight to defend their home or their family, they fight out of hatred and malice, the desire to kill. Their aim is not to throw off foreign rule, it is the slaughter of every single foreigner of that type.",

   "But isn't there not also the danger that we lose our usual society at the same time?\n Assuming that this 'war' is actually won someday.\n \n\n \n Definitely. I always enjoy seeing a The_Comedian post. \n \n \"One man's terrorist is another man's freedom-fighter.\"\n \n Those two terms are essentially the same. They are labels that people attach according to their own beliefs. The US and many of its people label Osama Bin Laden as a terrorists, however, many people in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and other parts of the Middle East consider him a defender of Arabs against the \"great Satan,\" a guardian of Islam, a shield between them and the horrors of western civilization. \n \n Many people think that when they label a person or a group, the rest of the world concurs with that title. Just because Donald Rumsfeld thinks Osama Bin Laden is a terrorist, doesn't mean he's a terrorist to the rest of the human race. Many Middle Eastern people, and many in Europe consider George W. Bush to be a terrorist and one the most dangerous men on the planet. That attitude applies to John Ashcroft as well, while the typical American likes to think of those two as defenders of the American way of life and the ideals of freedom and liberty. \n \n This doesn't solely apply to high profile characters. Many Iraqis think of coalition troops as terrorists against their homeland, and consider the Iraqi resistance fighters to be freedom fighters trying to evict the invaders. They see coalition troops as terrorists by bringing war to their country, killing women and children in cold blood, and essentially making them second rate citizens in their own country. \n \n Another perfect example of the terrorist verse freedom fighter labeling is the bloody, endless conflict involving the people of the Jewish state of Israel and Palestinians. \n \n Some think of Palestinians fighting for their freedom from Israel as freedom fighters. Israeli troops and civilians consider Palestine fighters and suicide bombers as terrorists, and one cannot fail to see how they have reached this conclusion. The Palestine group named Hamas has one ultimate goal: complete and utter destruction of Israel at any cost. To many Palestinians, Hamas is an organization devoted to the return of their land taken away by the creation of the Jewish state, a return of their freedoms, a return of the life without the oppression of the Israeli military. To the Israelis, Hamas is a threat of their very way of life. Hamas is both a terrorist organization and a group of freedom fighters dedicated to the pursuit of an independent, free Palestinian state. \n \n \n Americans have a tendency to label and not think about how the rest of the world thinks. They label groups and people \"terrorists,\" and demand everyone follows their lead. However, Americans skip over the very beginning of the start of their thinking. During the war for independence, Tories and the British considered colonial fighters and their supporters terrorists against the crown for their shooting of officers, destruction of property, and theft of munitions and food. \n \n The distinction is in the eye of the beholder",

We will be fine if we cut off contact with all other countries, but they will all collapse. But maybe in your mind that will work. I highly doubt it.\n\n \n Isolation is not a requirement, we must simply revert to our pre-WWII stance in dealing with other nations. Prior to WWII, it was accepted that our constitution governed the actions of our leaders even in dealing with matters of foreign policy. A nation that did not recognise basic human rights (like china), would never have been given favored nation trading status. We did not run around subverting governments and installing dictators as it would have been considered unconstitutional to encourage dictatorships anywhere in the world. \n \n Post WWII, a new theory in dealing with foreign policy has appeared, one that seperates the constitution entirely from foreign policy. Under this new plan, we don't care whether a nation commits mass murders, we have no problem with installing dictators. \n \n There is a differnce between trading with another country and exploiting them.\n \n All the other nations would collapse? Is this some kind of sick, fascist joke? We are running a 700 billion dollar trade deficit, yet consuming 70% of the worlds energy. We are carrying about $400 billion in debt, and that is expected to rise every year in the forseeable future. 40% of that debt is directly held by foreign interests, and another 20% is held by foreign companies in the US. Teh Us cannot afford to become isolationists becasue it would destroy us. Our manufaturing base is, for all intents and purposes, GONE. Without the rest of the world, the US would meet its end very quickly as transportation and communication services broke down (and I am not just talking from lack of oil). \n \n \nHow can you ever view hitting civilian targets of 3000 people as legitimate? So maybe if we don't agree with North Korea or Iran, we can just take one of their planes and blow up their buildings and kill thousands of people? Seems like it would be legitimate in your eyes. \n \n \n North Korea and Iran are not truly democratic nations, or that would be a possibility. Nothingin this world is free, and the things that we value the most are also the things that we must pay dearly for. We have the rigth to vote, the right to choose who leads our country, which means ultimatly the right to decide teh policies of our nation. With this awesome power comes a great responsibility. We cannot get a majority of Americans up off their keisters to go vote. Most of America makes their political decisions based soley on sound bytes and 30 second news clips. Now, we are paying for this. For years apathy has overcome this country like a disease. Now people are dying becasue of it. \n \n How is it legitimate to target civilians? It is legitimate to target civilians if those civilians are the people who are responsible for the acts that you protest. No citizen of a democratic nation is truly a civilian.\n \n \nI never once said it there was any connection, but thanks for the info (like I haven't heard that a million times). Notice \"because we thought that saddam was eating there\". We didn't do it with the intent of killing thousands of civilians. We also didn't kill 3000 of them. Bin Laden didn't target the WTC because he thought Bush was there; he did it because he's a piece of ****.\n\n \n Never once said there was a connection? What about when you said:\n \n \nWe are targeting those who attacked us in our own land. \n \n \n \nJust because you don't like or agree with a country, doesn't give you justification to kidnap and kill their people, or fly a plane into their buildings\n\n \n \nWe didn't go to Iraq, or bomb Iraq, with the intent of killing civilians. We are targeting those who attacked us in our own land. \n \n \n You were definatly implying that somehow by invading Iraq we are strinking at \"those who attacked us in our own land\". this is a load of bunk. It is transparent rhetoric. Maybe if you hear it a million and one times, you will catch on and quite trying to imply a connection that does not exist. You even admit that you already know it doesn't exist, yet you persist in trying to use it to bolster your illogical argument. \n \n BL's goal was not to kill bush, it was to kill American civilains. AQ was (and continues to) striking at the people who are responsible for the misdeeds done by the united states in the past several years. They are striking at the people who have not only allowed, but supported, Americas foreign policies.\n \n \nI will explain the difference, since you obviously don't have the intelligence to do so. We don't attach hundreds of Iraqis with turbans on our missiles and fly them into national monuments with thousands of people in them with the intent of killing innocent civilians...that's the difference buddy. If you don't see the difference, something must be wrong inside of your head.\n\n \n If your goal is to kill civilians, I don't see that there is really any difference. In the case of the airplane, you have simply increased the body count a little. If your goal is to kill civilians, this would seem to be a good strategy. \n \n \nHave we cut off their heads? Have we demanded that countries pull out troops or we will kill them? No. We have them because they attacked our country, and we are doing all we can to find Bin Laden and all other terrorists to try and put an end to terrorism.\n\n \n No, we apparently prefer to either drown them, beat them to death, or put them in container trucks and then machine gun them. \n \n In the case of the Iraqis in custoday. We have them because WE attacked THEIR country.\n \n There will never be an end to terrorism against the US without a change in our foreign policy. Until people like you get that through your heads, the country will be perpetually at risk. Aq has quadrupled in size, and their funding has increased by over 300% since we started our \"war on terror\". It doesn't seem that this strategy is working very well if the goal is to put an end to terrorism. It seems, in fact, that it is having the opposite effect. International support has pretty much gone in the toilet, there are more terrorists, and better funded terrorists than there have ever been before, and we are spending hudreds of billions per year on security measures.",

If you can.\n \n \n \n Maybe you are thinking of some other Desert Shield, but I will tell you of the one I am familiar with. In 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait because it was indebted to many Arab countries, and planned to get this money through their sale of oil. However, Kuwait increased production of oil, which in turn led to lower prices of oil, which angered Iraq. So they invaded Kuwait, which is a pretty dumb idea to invade. The Kuwaitis were overwhelmed, due to their much smaller relative size. Iraqis then began looting all Kuwaiti stores and took Americans hostage that were living in Kuwait. Maybe you don't remember that. Then the UN passed a resolution which demanded the Iraqis to remove their troops, which they didn't, so went sent our troops over there to defend Kuwait. We weren't the only ones. 33 other nations also participated. So obviously it was necessary because we had a good amount of support. We didn't actually invade Iraq, not try to install a democatic government. So I have no clue why you wanted me to explain this, I guess because you were having trouble reading it out of a textbook.\n \n \n \nExplain the Reagan Latin American death squads. If you can.\n \n \n \n That is nearly the same thing we are doing in Iraq. We helped the Iraqis become free from their intolerable ruler, much like we did in Guatemala. We didn't actually go into Guatemala, we just supplied them money. The majority (anti-commuinists) were being oppressed and asked for our help, so we supplied them with money and weapons, like we are doing in Iraq.\n \n \n \n \nHorse manure. They attacked us because we were the only power capable to standing up to them, and the only power capable to denying them in the South Pacific. We would not have attack them without provacation.\n \n \n \n So it's ok to attack someone just because they are bigger or more capable than you?

Look at it this way, would you be ****** if Thailand constantly interfered with your country, taking your resources, replacing your ideas with theirs, treating you and your fellow citizens like ****, and expecting your government to bend over backwards for them?

You just supported the genocide of 1.1 billion innocent Muslims. \n \n \n Also, did you see the news about some Iraqi insurgents attacking an Iraqi police station, killing 9 of them? Did they not approve of their OWN government?\n\n \n It makes sense to attack the police stations. Create instability, remove the government's ability to remove this instability, and in the process turn the citizens against the government and in favor of your cause. It's not their government. The government was placed in power by the US. Notice the lack of elections. This is not a democracy, not even remotely close, nor is it their government. Does the term puppet state mean anything to you? \n \n \n The way you put it, if you can't have everything you want you can just kill people and it's ok since it's \"in the name of freedom\".\n\n \n That's an absurd claim that you are saying I made. I challenge you to prove this. I doubt you will be able to. \n \n \n In 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait because it was indebted to many Arab countries, and planned to get this money through their sale of oil. However, Kuwait increased production of oil, which in turn led to lower prices of oil, which angered Iraq. \n\n \n This is the dumbest claim I have heard since January. Kuwait sits upon a miniscule amount of oil when compared to it's neighbors. It cannot change the price of oil by itself. Iraq invaded Kuwait to relieve the billions in debt it owed the Kuwaiti government and banks. \n \n \n Maybe you don't remember that.\n\n \n Well I do, and it makes a lot of sense why they did. Would you allow the citizens of your enemy who had 500,000 troops, thousands of armor pieces, several carriers and multiple airbases and who was intent on attacking you, go free? \n \n \n So obviously it was necessary because we had a good amount of support.\n\n \n The number of people who support it is irrelevant. We invaded because Iraq posed a threat to the stability of the oil in the Middle East. Iraq's goal was to become the regional power, which was unacceptable. \n \n \n We didn't actually invade Iraq,\n\n \n Yes we did. \n http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/gulf/maps/7.html\n http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/gulf/maps/9.html\n http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/gulf/maps/10.html\n \n \n That is nearly the same thing we are doing in Iraq. We helped the Iraqis become free from their intolerable ruler, much like we did in Guatemala. We didn't actually go into Guatemala, we just supplied them money. The majority (anti-commuinists) were being oppressed and asked for our help, so we supplied them with money and weapons, like we are doing in Iraq.\n\n \n Hardly. There isn't even a single similarity between the two. The communists in Nicaragua were beneficial to the people, yet we sent down death squads that murdered, raped, and kidnapped hundreds of thousands of innocents. Likewise the same happened in Guatemala. The people being oppressed were the tiny minority that ruled much of the country before the uprising by the people. Under their leadership, thousands starved, thousands more had no jobs, poverty was rampant, food was scarce, and land usage was appalling. Those who were oppressed were the ones that brought about the revolution. Iraq has nothing in common with Latin America. \n \n \n So it's ok to attack someone just because they are bigger or more capable than you? So if, one day, China can stand up to us, we have the right to blow up their naval fleet?\n\n \n I challenge you again to prove this. And I know you will fail to do so. Utterly and completely. \n \n \n If this is creating so much of a problem, we should just leave all the governments in the Middle East alone and just let them kill everyone until there is no Middle East. Put Saddam back in power and let him gas 100,000 more people?\n\n \n Who said they are killing everyone? Last time I checked, the governments of the UAE, Bahrain, Iran, Turkey, Yemen, Lebanon, Jordan and Egypt weren't mass murdering people. Considering Saddam didn't have gas, he couldn't have gassed more people. \n \n \n We SUPPORTED the contras. We didn't actually fight with them, we gave them weapons and money.\n\n \n That's questionable. \n \n \n So I guess we should start blowing up mosques and soccer stadiums in the Iraq and Afghanistan rather than trying to kill Bin Laden? It would put more fear in the civilians eyes.\n\n \n Do you understand the difference between tactics a inferior force uses against a superior force and vise versa?

   " \"I believe that we didn't invade Iraq or Afghanistan until Bin Laden attacked us\".\n\n \n But it clearly implies that Iraq was linked to the attack. You imply that our attack was provoked by an attack by Bin Laden, justifying an invasion. All OBL-Iraq links have been proven to been shams. \n \n \n We have also interfered in the Philippines, Japan, China, South Korea, Canada, and other countries.\n\n \n And the majority of people hate us there. \n \n \n For some reason they aren't murdering our people.\n\n \n Because obviously they have jobs, educations and don't have theocratic governments who preach extremist religions. Any one with a brain can figure this out. Oh wait, sorry, I didn't mean to say that. \n \n \n If a large terrorist group like al Qaeda or the Taliban attacks us, we have the right to search for them.\n\n \n The Taliban didn't attack the US. Nor did Iraq. Therefore your statement is incorrect if you support the war. Iraq did not attack the US, and therefore we have no right to search them clearly based on your logic. \n \n \n What resources are we taking from Iraq? We aren't stealing oil.\n\n \n But we are taking their land to build 14 permanent US bases which will increase US influence in the region as well as setting up US corporations in control of Iraqi oil, giving the US the capability of controlling the price of oil. Not to mention that we are essentially ripping off every Iraqi by selling them their own oil for $1-2 more then the surrounding areas. \n \n \n we also aren't interfering with their culture. We didn't tell them all to convert to Judaism or Christianity.\n\n \n Do you even understand what the West has been doing to the countries it has intervened in? Wait, apparently not. \n \n \n They do as they please. The only thing we did was introduce a democracy.\n\n \n We did not introduce democracy into the US, nor do they do as they please. For instance, the Saudi Government is prostituting itself to the US for aid, and continued purchases of oil, which directly go to supporting the welfare state and the continued reign of the House of Saud. Not to mention that Western notions, clothing, speak, food and culture itself is becoming rampant in much of the Middle East. Go to any large shopping mall. You'll find virtually every major name brand in the West there. \n \n \n We also aren't treating their citizens like ****. Maybe prisoners, but not civilians.\n\n \n Explain why US soldiers now have similar names they used against our enemies in the past that now refer to Iraqis. If you can, which is highly unlikely. Why is it that every interview, every report, every poll coming out of Iraq paints the picture of the US treating Iraqis like ****? Why is it that few Iraqi companies receive large projects? Why is it that few Iraqi engineers and scientists are getting jobs, but foreign specialists are being flown in? \n \n \n Hell, they could still be living under Saddam, getting tortured for opposing him, killed for not obeying him, and having to live in cruel and unsafe conditions in fear of anything they do. That does sound like a good life to live. Maybe you should try it, and then tell me what you think.\n\n \n And life would be considerably safer. Before, Iraqis had no fear of going out at night, or simply into the streets during the day. Now there is a high chance you won't come back. Conditions under Saddam were stable, not necessarily, free, but you didn't have to think twice about stepping outside. People are begging their parents not to go to work because they probably won't come back. Does that sound like a good life to live? One where you aren't sure you'll survive walking down the street? \n \n \n Bin Laden got rid of 3000 innocent Americans, is that ok? That is the extermination of a group of people he didn't like just because of their beliefs? Your above comment was terrible, stupid, and downright dumb. But it is fitting coming from someone like you. It seems like it's ok, according to what you have said. If you don't believe with them interfering in your affairs, influencing your culture, maybe we should just get rid of them.\n\n \n Actually, he only got rid of less then 2,500. The death toll didn't break 3,000, and many were foreign nationalists. I'm not saying that's okay, but you are supporting mass murder on a global scale against people you know nothing about. The comment is perfect. You simply choose to ignore it. You have stated \"If so, we need to just destroy the whole Middle East because some of us want our \"freedom\".\" You are a genocide supporter. If we did not interfere with their lives, they wouldn't have done the same. Do you really believe the US is innocent? \n \n \n Then if that makes sense, we could have saved a lot of money. Instead of going to war in Iraq, we could have just blew up all their banks and police stations and waited until chaos erupted, then we could go in and save them. Once again, another brutal idea.\n\n \n Once again you completely fail to understand the difference in tactics for a inferior force compared to a superior force. But that's not surprising considering the quality of your argument. \n \n \n There you go. If someone takes over and doesn't believe the same as you, then isn't it \"fighting for freedom\"? What about the death threats to Allawi by al Qaeda. What if we had a group in the US that opposed Bush and threatened to kill him? It's the same thing. If they don't like his tax breaks, then they should kill him?\n\n \n That doesn't prove anything. A foreign force is different then an election. Death threats are simply a means of provoking change, not necessarily a very successful one, but it is a method. Do you understand the difference between a elected official and a force that is from another nation? \n \n \n Iraq also accused Kuwait of producing more oil than allowed under quotas set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), thereby depressing the price of oil, Iraq's main export.\"\n\n \n Utterly retarded. A simple calculation in economics proves that theory wrong. How can a county that contains a miniscule amount of oil change the price of oil regionally or globally? That is the most ridiculous claim ever. That is saying that a tiny lemonade stand in Seattle will change the price of lemonade across the country. Ridiculous. This could only have happened if OPEC agreed with Kuwait and therefore made the quotas higher. Numbers don't lie, but you probably do. \n \n \n Why is it irrelevant?\n\n \n Because majority support does not make anything necessary or right. \n \n \n I think you may have gotten lost in the moment here.\n\n \n No, you are fabricating. You implied that I said that it's okay to attack anyone in \n who will be more powerful then you in the future. I challenged you to prove that. You have failed. Not surprisingly, much of your argument is a complete failure. \n \n \n You said, \"They attacked us because we were the only power capable to standing up to them, and the only power capable to denying them in the South Pacific\". That means they had the right to attack us because we were bigger and better.\n\n \n And this is why much of your argument is a failure. I never said that it was okay, but merely why they did it. I did not condone nor condemn the action. Your argument is a fabrication, and considering how poorly you are arguing it, it makes sense that you must resort to lies. You have failed to prove anything. \n \n \n Saddam did have gas. Once again, I am king!!! Read this...\"Human Rights Watch estimates that Saddam's 1987-1988 campaign of terror against the Kurds killed at least 50,000 and possibly as many as 100,000 Kurds.\n\n \n Once again you are a proven liar. Let's do the math. 2004-1988 = 16 years. Let's say you had a car 16 years ago, does that mean you have it now? Besides, every current intelligence agency, after looking through the data and scouring Iraq has come up with the same conclusion: No Vx, No viable Mustard, No Anthrax, No Gas., and no viable means to produce these weapons. So therefore Saddam could not have gassed people with weapons he did not have.\n \n \n You were utterly and completely incorrect \n\n \n If we were talking about this in 1989, you would be correct, however, new intelligence along with simple 3rd grade math proves you wrong once again. By the way you completely failed to back your assertion that the governments of the Middle East were mass murdering people. You have taken another fallacy, the fallacy of selective reading, by picking weaker portions of your opponent's argument, and ignoring the stronger ones, you assert that the entire argument is weak. Pathetic. \n \n \n Yes I do. But what makes it ok for an inferior group to hijack someone's plane and fly it into their building? If those who are inferior can use any tactics, we should just send a few people to Iraq (since they will be inferior) and let them hijhack a plane.\n\n \n No you don't. You made a claim again that proves you don't know the first things about inferior/superior tactics. Where exactly did it say it was okay? Again I challenge you to prove that and know full well you will fail. \n \n \n But some of your reasoning and distorted facts sound like they are coming from someone with that low of a mind capacity.\n\n \n Considering that you have fallen into multiple fallacies, as well as resorted to lies and disregard of current information, it seems what your assert that belongs to me, actually applies to you, the accuser. \n \n You haven't proven a single thing beyond your ability to ignore posts you don't like, rely on lies and fallacies and continue to practice multiple adhomen attacks.",

About a few weeks ago, I was reading an article on Reuters. They were comparing gas prices around the world, and the price of gas in Iraq was around 7 cents (for the Iraqis). They said something about Iraqi families filling up their cars for $1. So I don't see how if we are selling it for 7 cents, we are charging them $1-$2 more than surrounding areas. I guess that means we are paying them $.93-$1.93 a gallon. I doubt it.\n \n \n \n \n \nWe did not introduce democracy into the US, nor do they do as they please.

Why is it that few Iraqi companies receive large projects?

They overportray everything that happens. Read some info about post-war Iraq. They can now have satellites, own their own shops, their average pay is increasing, and many other things have prospered.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnd life would be considerably safer.

If I was truly illiterate, I could not read your response, and therefore I could not be talking to you. \n \n \n I did not state that, I said that after Bin Laden attacked us, we went into Afghanistan and Iraq to look for him.\n\n \n But there were no ties to Iraq with Bin Laden, nor did Iraq attack us, and using your own logic that if someone bombs you, you have the right to search them, we had no right to search Iraq because they did not bomb us. \n \n \n you just use that because you can't find anything that you said that was correct, so you try and fabricate stuff.\n\n \n Prove it. You're the one who's fabricating. \n \n You said this: \n If a large terrorist group like al Qaeda or the Taliban attacks us, we have the right to search for them.\n\n \n Then you said this: \n I never said Iraq attacked us,\n\n \n But you said that we searched Iraq after we got attacked, and if you are bombed, you can go search the bomber. So by searching Iraq, you have linked that Iraq bombed us. Simply logical math. \n \n \n But they don't kill us...that's the main thing.\n\n \n Because they need our money. Actually, to say they don't is quite ignorant. How do you know they aren't? Training accidents are often the cover for sketchy and under the rug events. \n \n \n Not directly they didn't, but Bin Laden was a strong supporter of them and they hid him in their country. So since we were looking for him, we went in there.\n\n \n You do realize that simple support means that virtually anyone can search anyone else? So now technically virtually every ME state can search us because of Israel. I am not making up any fabrications, simply using your logic against you. Simply because you cannot refute this does not mean you are winning. \n \n \n Sorry, but you're wrong again. About a few weeks ago, I was reading an article on Reuters. They were comparing gas prices around the world, and the price of gas in Iraq was around 7 cents (for the Iraqis). They said something about Iraqi families filling up their cars for $1. So I don't see how if we are selling it for 7 cents, we are charging them $1-$2 more than surrounding areas. I guess that means we are paying them $.93-$1.93 a gallon. I doubt it.\n\n \n On the contrary, the theme of you constantly being wrong is proven once again (as well as ignoring facts you do not like to wage a fallacy of selective reading). Do the math. Do you even know who Halliburton is and the scandals? \n \n CBS/AP) President Bush, trying to calm a political storm, said Friday that Vice President Dick Cheney's former company should repay the government if it overcharged for gasoline delivered in Iraq under a controversial prewar contract. \n \n \"If there's an overcharge, like we think there is, we expect that money be repaid,\" the president told reporters when asked about the Halliburton contract controversy. \n \n Pentagon auditors say the company charged up to $61 million too much for delivering gasoline to Iraqi citizens under a no-bid contract to rebuild Iraq's dilapidated oil industry. Halliburton denies overcharging.\n http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/12/11/politics/main588122.shtml\n \n \n\n We have lots of stuff from Taiwan and China, but we don't complain and try to kill their people. It is called trade...we buy stuff they make because we don't make it and they in turn buy our stuff\n\n \n Completely irrelevant to my post. You ignored the introduction and overrun by Western ideals. You ignored the changing of culture by introduction of Western Investment. You ignored the entire post to post some meaningless ****. \n \n \n Liberal media\"? That's why everything is the way it is.\n\n \n If you cannot say anything more then that, leave. \n \n \n How do you consider that? Yes you might get killed by a terrorist now, but you also won't be illegally imprisoned because you don't agree with Saddam, you won't be gassed, you can worship as you please, etc.\n\n \n Do you even read anything except Newsmax. Read the new time and Newsweek. It's ALL there. People are afraid to leave their houses because they probably will get gunned down. As long as you did not say anything bad about Saddam you had nothing to fear, and you could not get gassed because he HAD NO GAS. As for worship, as long as you weren't a extremist, AKA Wahabbism, you had nothing to fear. True, Saddam life sucked, but it was better then getting shot at every 5 seconds. \n \n \n I seriously doubt they are wrong. But maybe you need to talk to them personally.\n\n \n Numbers don't lie. Nor do simply economics of country supply to global supply. Notice how you can't argue this one. \n \n \n I just compared what you thought was ok or acceptable,\n\n \n Please tell me how acceptable means why they did it. If you can. \"John killed Mary because she was sleeping around.\" Obviously to you the person who said that condones john's act. A observation is not a opinion. \n \n \n What about the bomb we blew up about a month ago in Iraq that emitted mustard gas? How did that get there? Once again...WRONG\n\n \n Do you read anything? That, along with the other 3, were from the Iraq-Iran war. Mustard gas doesn't have a very long shelf life either. Not to mention that it is extremely fickle due to weather. There was no chemical production, nor stockpile. No Gas, No Stockpiles, you have no argument. \n \n \n Well you should be good at 3rd grade math, since your comments and intelligence are on the same level.\n\n \n Please tell me how 2004 =1988. If you can. \n \n \n Some people, if they can't take being wrong and having it pointed out without any cursing, just need to stick to the Disney Channel or go somewhere else.\n \n\n \n Majority of your arguments are personal attacks. You have failed to prove anything. Simple MATH proves you wrong. \n \n Notice I have never stated anything about my intelligence. Notice how I have not resorted to known fallacies. Notice how my arguments are based upon credible sources, not riddles with personal attacks. Notice how I can argue my points, instead of trying to pass the buck by saying it's Encarta (btw, it helps to use the newer version with recent topics, you wouldn't argue about stem cells research with a 1998 Encarta, likewise you wouldn't argue about this with a 1995 Encarta). \n \n \nI think maybe the older crowd just can't accept the fact that the younger guy may be smarter than them?\n\n \n Another fallacy. You assume that age means anything in terms of intelligence. Knowledge of the Ancients/Youth is a fallacy the rational shun.\n \n Grow up.",

   "I feel compelled to add something here. \n \n You seem awfully insecure about yourself. You are constantly telling everyone they are stupid and you are the only person with any brains. In fact, you made a grandiose show of posting your IQ and other achievement test scores and then challenging others to beat them. However, a person who was truly confident in themself or their intelligence wouldn't need to keep coming back here after being booted three times in a (pathetic) attempt to demonstrate their alleged superiority.\n \n I don't know where this insecurity comes from. Supposedly you made a killing in the stock market when everyone else tanked, supposedly you drive a corvette that you almost paid cash for, supposedly you went to a first-class educational institution, ad nauseum--given this track record I would think you would feel pretty good about yourself. Maybe you are lying to us about this stuff, maybe being born with a silver spoon has given you an inferiority/guilt complex, maybe the stress of being an unrecognized genius is too difficult to overcome...whatever the case may be I suggest you get some professional help. \n \n Mind you, I say this not out of spite but out of concern for a fellow human.\n \n Whistler\n\n \n I will add to that, if you don't mind. \n \n I didn't realise this was the same lying scoundrel from before. Duo, quit feeding the troll. If we all just ignore him, he will go away. You are talking about somebody who allegedly has the IQ of a genius, but doesn't seem to show up in the mensa directory (of course, mine is a few years old, so maybe he just became a genius lately). This is somebody who claims to have a first rate education, and claims to have made a killing in the stock market, yet had to have a couple of us dumb old guys explain the social benifits derived from taxation. I checked with a couple of college professors I know, and that is still taght in the first year of economics. \n \n I, for one, am calling foul on this particualr individual. he has contradicted himself too many times, and has made too many blatently ignorant statements to believe that he has gotten any kind of decent education at all, much less that he is some kind of genius.\n \n \nI never said I was the only one with brains. I also never challenged anyone to beat me. I simply stated my IQ. I'm not insecure, I just hate ignorant people (most of the people in this forum). For instance, people implying I said Iraq had something to do with 9/11. I said nothing of the like, however some people (maybe because they can't read) still continue to think I did. \n \n \n Then maybe you could use your non-existant superior intellect to explain this:\n \n \nNever once said there was a connection? What about when you said:\n \n Quote:\n We are targeting those who attacked us in our own land. \n \n Quote:\n Just because you don't like or agree with a country, doesn't give you justification to kidnap and kill their people, or fly a plane into their buildings \n \n Quote:\n We didn't go to Iraq, or bomb Iraq, with the intent of killing civilians. We are targeting those who attacked us in our own land. \n \n \n You were definatly implying that somehow by invading Iraq we are strinking at \"those who attacked us in our own land\". this is a load of bunk. It is transparent rhetoric. Maybe if you hear it a million and one times, you will catch on and quite trying to imply a connection that does not exist. You even admit that you already know it doesn't exist, yet you persist in trying to use it to bolster your illogical argument\n\n \n \n \nThe same goes with the IQ issue. I just stated it. I never asked other people's what theirs was and then taunted them. The only time I taunt people is when they either say some obnoxiously wrong of they tell me I am wrong, when in fact I was right. How is that insecure? It's not like I just came out and said \"Hey...my name is Brian. I have a Corvette. I go to a great school. I have a great job.\". Someone made a post that I didn't agree with, we went back and forth, and I felt those things were necessary. And the reason I keep coming back is because I love debating and making people like you feel bad about themselves. It's rather amusing, I must say. I think maybe the older crowd just can't accept the fact that the younger guy may be smarter than them?\n\n \n No, you showed up, shot your mouth off, told a bunch of lies, insulted a bunch of people who are, frankly, brighter than you (like most people on this board) and annoyed a bunch of thinking people with your unintelligent and uninformed idiocy. \n \n I, for one, have no problem with younger people being smart. If Broker or ghost are ever looking for jobs, they should definatly look me up. You, though, are an ignorant fool who has apparently deluded yourself into believing otherwise. There is nothing wrong with being a mental reject. You can still sweep floors at Burger King. it is true! I was there today and they had a really nice retarded man working there, so there is hope when you find out that the imaginary money you have made from your imaginary career turns out to be insufficient to keep food on your table.\n \n \n Next time you change names, could you let us all know so we can start ignoring you immediatly instead. That would seem to be the curteous thing to do.\n \n DUO<...don't feed the trolls.",
