   "OK. I am really going to need some help to understand this one. Bryan, anyone? Anyone an SEIU member? \n \n Set up for the news articles. Video.   Andy Sterns said. We took names, we watched how they voted. \n \n   What's really behind SEIU's Bank of America protests? \n Waving signs denouncing bank \"greed,\" hordes of invaders poured out of 14 school buses, up Baer's steps, and onto his front porch. As bullhorns rattled with stories of debtor calls and foreclosed homes, Baer's teenage son Jack -- alone in the house -- locked himself in the bathroom. \"When are they going to leave?\" Jack pleaded when I called to check on him.\n \n But when hundreds of loud and angry strangers are descending on your family, your children, and your home, a more apt description of this assemblage would be \"mob.\" Intimidation was the whole point of this exercise, and it worked-even on the police. A trio of officers who belatedly answered our calls confessed a fear that arrests might \"incite\" these trespassers. \n\n Let me translate. The Cops were afraid! At the very least, they surely didn't protect this home owner, or the residents of this street!\n \n Is Anyone else troubled by this next part?\n  D.C. Metro Police Escorted SEIU Protesters to Bank Of America Executive's Home \n At least two Metropolitan Police Department units from the nearby District of Columbia were already at the scene when they arrived. Why? Because police cars attached to the Washington MPD's Civil Disturbance Unit had escorted the SEIU protesters' buses to Baer's home.\n \n Still, the District police did not inform their colleagues of what was about to happen in one of their Maryland neighborhoods.\n \n The Maryland officers reported there were approximately 500 protesters on and near the front lawn of Baer's house. \n \n The primary role of the Washington cops in this event was to protect the protesters.\n\n Why do 14 bus loads, 500 SCIU members, need 2 Police squad cars from DC to protect them from 1 Home owner? \n \n Fishy? I don't think so! I think the COPS were there to Intimidate the one home owner, just like SEIU was there to do! Cops! Of all things, they used Washington DC COPS! Cops! \n \n No? What am I missing?\n \n Makes one wonder if things got out of hand and the protesters started throwing rocks through the window, and if the terrified home owner would have stepped out with a fire arm, am I wrong to think that the DC police would have shot the home owner? Seriously What the heck gives? Cops! Part of the angry mob?\n \n If nothing else, 500 people trashed this guys lawn! That is for sure.\n \n Am I missing something here, or am I correct to think that we have totally degenerated into Chicago style intimidation politics? See the video for reasons why I believe this.",

This isn't partisanship!\n\n \n I'm sorry, but your entire rant is nothing but ignorance based fear mongering. From YOUR ARTICLE:\n \n \nThe family of Greg Baer, Bank of America executive, is located in a jurisdiction protected by the Montgomery County Police Department (MCPD), which responded promptly to a disturbance call from his neighborhood last weekend.\n \n According to Corporal Dan Friz, an MCPD spokesperson in Rockville, Maryland, the department received a disturbance call from one of Baer's neighbors at 4:10 pm last Sunday. Four MCPD units arrived at Baer's Greenville Rd. address at 4:15 pm.  At least two Metropolitan Police Department units from the nearby District of Columbia were already at the scene when they arrived.\n\n \n So the local police did respond. \n \n \nWhy? Because police cars attached to the Washington MPD's Civil Disturbance Unit had escorted the SEIU protesters' buses to Baer's home. Such cross-jurisdictional escort activity is not uncommon for both departments according to Friz and Metro Police Department spokesperson Officer Eric Frost. Still, the District police did not inform their colleagues of what was about to happen in one of their Maryland neighborhoods.\n\n \n So cross jurisdictional escort is a fairly common occurrence in the area. You will note that it is not the local cops talking about not being informed....it is the author of the article whining about it.\n \n \nAccording to Friz, \"members of protest groups know how far to push the envelope\" and wait for \"the key words\" - for example, the property owner's request that they leave - in order to avoid arrests or citations. For example, protesters are required to keep on the move, since a standing protest violates a Montgomery County code. And, while photographs clearly suggest that many of the SEIU protesters were stationary, the District police don't have any authority to enforce Montgomery County laws.\n\n \n So in other words, the protesters were careful not to break the law. \n \n And while the person who wrote the article makes it a point to include in several places that the local PD was not notified, the local PD NEVER MENTIONS IT Why do you suppose that is? The most likely explanation BY FAR is that notification is not a part of the normal procedure for those cases. Believe it or not, cops do not just wander around doing whatever they want, wherever they want. Police departments have procedures for EVERYTHING. This is especially true when it involves leaving their jurisdiction since under federal law a cross jurisdictional agreement is required and must be not only approved by the primary law enforcement and fire protection officer, it also has to be approved by the local governing board (city council, county commission, etc...) for the areas impacted. Those agreements require things like notification guidelines. \n \n So what we have here is a bunch of protesters who were careful not to break the law, protesting in front of a guys house who was complicit in a massive dishonest fraud.\n \n And you have a problem with that.",

You ignore the LIKELY scenarios and immediately jump to an extremely UNLIKELY one that fits your agenda...that they used school facilities without paying for them.\n \n Our local school district rents out school buses to groups and rents building facilities out for events all the time. It is smart....they have the resources on hand and it provides a little extra money for the district. Granted that explanation does not fit your agenda, and it would be much easier for you to make your point if we all ignored the most LIKELY solution and instead accepted your EXTREMELY UNLIKELY solution at face value, but you cant actually expect people with any intelligence at all to do that. \n \n As far as the cops go....have you ever seen a protest where there were NOT cops on hand? I certainly never have. Even when Fred Phelps and his little band of sickos protests a funeral, the police are there to make sure that nobody starts handing out beat downs. One of the beautiful things about America is that you have the right to protest, and the police have a responsibility to protect you while you do it. The idea that the DC police would not have protected the BOA executive is another completely unsupported assumption put forth here and to some degree by the author of the article and frankly it is a particularly ignorant one. The author of the article contends that if the protesters had decided to burn the guys house there is nothing the DC police could have done to stop it since they were outside their jurisdiction AFTER they talk about the fact that there is a cross jurisdictional agreement in place. Frankly you would have to have the intelligence of a house plant to follow that line of reasoning.\n \n Your take on this entire thing is ridiculous and unamerican. There is no evidence whatsoever that anything improper took place here. What happened is that a bunch of protesters who were careful not to break the law went and told a guy that he is a huge XXXXX. The DC PD sent 2 units to ensure that nobody was hurt during the course of the protest. The local police also sent units in response to calls from neighbors. The local police stayed until the end, but no arrests were made because, as they noted in their statement, the protesters were careful not to break any laws. \n \n I believe that you, sir, are little more than a partisan hack bending reality to fit your agenda.",

   "Nobody but you has suggested that the schools are out any money except for you, and you have presented no evidence whatsoever that they are. You ignore the LIKELY scenarios and immediately jump to an extremely UNLIKELY one that fits your agenda...that they used school facilities without paying for them.\n\n \n Then you shouldn't have any problem backing up your claims with some invoices, requests and approval and any Constitutional evidence that you are correct. The fact is, as stated by CNN, Fox and other media is that 14 SCHOOL BUSES were used for transportation. I suppose that would make the school liable if anyone was injured also? Seems like you are the one with baseless claims? There isn't anything LIKELY but your desire to support thugs.\n \n \nOur local school district rents out school buses to groups and rents building facilities out for events all the time. It is smart....they have the resources on hand and it provides a little extra money for the district. Granted that explanation does not fit your agenda, and it would be much easier for you to make your point if we all ignored the most LIKELY solution and instead accepted your EXTREMELY UNLIKELY solution at face value, but you cant actually expect people with any intelligence at all to do that.\n\n \n What's that? Campaigning and use of taxpayer funded facilities like transportation for political purposes? I suppose they paid the cops for going out of their jurisdiction too? \n \n \nAs far as the cops go....have you ever seen a protest where there were NOT cops on hand? I certainly never have. Even when Fred Phelps and his little band of sickos protests a funeral, the police are there to make sure that nobody starts handing out beat downs. One of the beautiful things about America is that you have the right to protest, and the police have a responsibility to protect you while you do it. The idea that the DC police would not have protected the BOA executive is another completely unsupported assumption put forth here and to some degree by the author of the article and frankly it is a particularly ignorant one. The author of the article contends that if the protesters had decided to burn the guys house there is nothing the DC police could have done to stop it since they were outside their jurisdiction AFTER they talk about the fact that there is a cross jurisdictional agreement in place. Frankly you would have to have the intelligence of a house plant to follow that line of reasoning.\n\n \n emoticon_cry I AM SURE the news media isn't through vetting it nor is congress.\n \n \nYour take on this entire thing is ridiculous and unamerican. There is no evidence whatsoever that anything improper took place here. What happened is that a bunch of protesters who were careful not to break the law went and told a guy that he is a huge XXXXX. The DC PD sent 2 units to ensure that nobody was hurt during the course of the protest. The local police also sent units in response to calls from neighbors. The local police stayed until the end, but no arrests were made because, as they noted in their statement, the protesters were careful not to break any laws.\n\n \n So, you were there!!\n No where else was acceptable or just didn't think you could get away with it anywhere else? \n Bank of America - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n Like I said in my first statement, if you are gonna protest go to the source. \n \n \nI believe that you, sir, are little more than a partisan hack bending reality to fit your agenda.\n\n \n Hardly. Obviously I had a lot more sense than you. My house and land is paid for long ago, I refused all credit cards including VISA and BOA and shun debt. Hardly a hack until is comes to strong arm union tactics who use force to chill public debate or frighten working folks in their family home...unless they are public officials. :xcensored I have worked mobs in an official capacity I don't think you can enlighten me much on mobocracy.

The law professors do not agree with you either, no matter how violent you get you and your buddies broke the law.\n \n Eugene Volokh \u0095 May 24, 2010 2:36 pm \n \n Nina Easton at Fortune writes about an SEIU protest at a Bank of America executive's house, and reports that \"hordes of invaders poured out of 14 school buses, up Baer's steps, and onto his front porch.\" (Easton is Baer's neighbor, and is apparently reporting based on her own personal observation.) Reader Sean Mattingly asks whether this could lead to a civil lawsuit against SEIU.\n \n I'm inclined to say that it indeed can, if it is right that the SEIU protesters went onto Baer's property, and if they did so beyond just having a couple of people come up briefly to ring the doorbell. Intentionally going on another's property without his permission is a trespass, and can lead to compensatory and punitive damages. What's more, if this was seen as part of the SEIU's organizational plan, and not just as the actions of some stray low-level members, then I think the SEIU itself would be liable.\n \n There are limits to this in situations where such behavior is customarily allowed, and where no contrary statement has been made by the property owner. \"Permission may be implied where the owner acquiesces in the known, customary use of property by the public.\" (See also Alvin v. Simpson, 491 N.W.2d 604 (Mich. Ct. App. 1992), acknowledging this as to residential property, there a back yard.) Going onto someone's porch to ring the doorbell and ask for directions, try to sell Girl Scout cookies, hand out religious or political literature, and the like is generally allowed, on the theory that such normal behavior is implicitly licensed by the property owner (unless the owner specifically says the contrary with regard to some uses, for instance by posting a \"No Soliciting\" sign). But it seems to me that going onto a porch en masse, or for more than just the time it takes to knock on the door and explain oneself to the resident, would go far beyond any such implied license. If any of you are more knowledgeable about this corner of trespass tort law than I am (the criminal law of trespass is a separate area), I'd love to hear more on this from you.\n \n I hope you got as deep pockets as you do a smart mouth :)\n You going to defend SEIU in Court? I think you have the right behavior to really impress a JUDGE emoticon_xgood",

   "11:27 PM Eastern - May 19, 2010 \n Al Marshall Responds to Nina Easton\n By Al Marshall\n \n Al Marshall is an SEIU member who was part of the group that tried to talk with Bank of America lobbyist Gregory Baer on Sunday. His lost his house to foreclosure. This letter is in response to Nina Easton's article in Fortune magaine.\n \n Dear Ms. Easton,\n \n This week I boarded a plane to come to Washington, D.C. for the first time in my life.

   "What? You think BOA is going to loan them so more money on top of the 94 million they owe to pay rent on school buses? The SEIU isn't relieving any stress on anyone but adding to it. \n\n \n Bad news, dude, in the real world where us grownups live, it is possible to owe the bank millions of dollars and still have millions of dollars in your bank account. \n \n \n \n \nSo your answer is to support one cause and if someone else opposed will never ask for it then it must be all right? Those school buses were made to transport school kids on and not adult political causes.\n\n \n They were made to transport people. It does not matter who the people are, and if the school district can make extra money by renting them out, more power to them. \n \n \n \nI don't recall a school bus around in the 40s and as naive as you are you were not alive then, I was. Keep stretching your tail pinoccio. \n \n\n \n And you dont recall ever seeing a non school meeting held at a school, or a boy scout event? \n \n You sound like an XXXXX. \n \n \n\n It was bad enough without the use of purloined property. Show me some paid bills since you were on the school board as you claim. I got a bill for the president and wife's trip to an expensive motel and lobster dinner :) Surely a man of your caliber and connections can access records? They are public aren't they?\n\n \n Again, child, YOU are the one making the claim that the school district was financially harmed by this. It is YOUR responsibility to provide evidence of this. I merely pointed out that you had no evidence of the claim you were making and that the far more likely explanation is that they rented the buses from the school. \n \n If you want to continue your unsupported claim, YOU need to provide proof. Demanding that I come up with receipts is ludicrous, childish, and frankly only highlights the fact that you have no real argument here. \n \n \nFrom the article I linked, from wiki, BOA already repaid their loans. Some are outstanding to BOA though and one of them belongs to SEIU.\n\n \n That has nothing AT ALL to do with this. You really have NO IDEA what you are talking about or what happened during the financial crisis, do you? The \"bailout\" was not so much a bailout as it was a bridge loan. The fact that they repaid their government bridge loan is irrelevant and does not change the fact that they packaged and marketed hundreds of billions of dollars worth of securities as prime paper while also betting against them \n \n Sorry. You still have got NOTHING but an apparent hatred for law abiding Americans exercising their constitutional rights.",

   "Here ya go mud man! The law professors do not agree with you either, no matter how violent you get you and your buddies broke the law.\n \n Eugene Volokh \u0095 May 24, 2010 2:36 pm \n \n Nina Easton at Fortune writes about an SEIU protest at a Bank of America executive's house, and reports that \"hordes of invaders poured out of 14 school buses, up Baer's steps, and onto his front porch.\" (Easton is Baer's neighbor, and is apparently reporting based on her own personal observation.) Reader Sean Mattingly asks whether this could lead to a civil lawsuit against SEIU.\n \n I'm inclined to say that it indeed can, if it is right that the SEIU protesters went onto Baer's property, and if they did so beyond just having a couple of people come up briefly to ring the doorbell. Intentionally going on another's property without his permission is a trespass, and can lead to compensatory and punitive damages. What's more, if this was seen as part of the SEIU's organizational plan, and not just as the actions of some stray low-level members, then I think the SEIU itself would be liable.\n \n There are limits to this in situations where such behavior is customarily allowed, and where no contrary statement has been made by the property owner. \"Permission may be implied where the owner acquiesces in the known, customary use of property by the public.\" (See also Alvin v. Simpson, 491 N.W.2d 604 (Mich. Ct. App. 1992), acknowledging this as to residential property, there a back yard.) Going onto someone's porch to ring the doorbell and ask for directions, try to sell Girl Scout cookies, hand out religious or political literature, and the like is generally allowed, on the theory that such normal behavior is implicitly licensed by the property owner (unless the owner specifically says the contrary with regard to some uses, for instance by posting a \"No Soliciting\" sign). But it seems to me that going onto a porch en masse, or for more than just the time it takes to knock on the door and explain oneself to the resident, would go far beyond any such implied license. If any of you are more knowledgeable about this corner of trespass tort law than I am (the criminal law of trespass is a separate area), I'd love to hear more on this from you.\n \n I hope you got as deep pockets as you do a smart mouth :)\n You going to defend SEIU in Court? I think you have the right behavior to really impress a JUDGE emoticon_xgood\n\n \n The only problem with this being that Volokh, a california law professor, is working from the assumption that their behavior could be viewed as trespass. \n \n Unfortunately for you, the officers in Tithers article already confirmed that the jurisdiction where this took place, they have to be ASKED to leave before it becomes trespass, and the police confirmed that the guy did NOT ask him to leave. \n \n Frankly Eugene, who I am typically a fan of, is WAY OUT on this one and is being straight out dishonest. He is citing case law from Michigan, which has no relevance in Maryland since it specifically deals with Michigan state laws. He knows better. He should stick to constitutional law. He is excellent at that. Frankly his batting average in other areas of law is somewhere between poor and abysmal.",

   "Why did police escort protesters? Probably because there is almost ALWAYS a police presence at organized protests. It keeps things from getting out of hand. \n\n \n \nThe primary role of the Washington cops in this event was to protect the protesters.\n \n Protect them from whom? The One Homeowner? So now we have to question that! \n Again Nena Easton writes.   When is a protest not a protest? \n Now this event would accurately be called a \"protest\" if it were taking place at, say, a bank or the U.S. Capitol. But when hundreds of loud and angry strangers are descending on your family, your children, and your home, a more apt description of this assemblage would be \"mob.\" Intimidation was the whole point of this exercise, and it worked-even on the police. A trio of officers who belatedly answered our calls confessed a fear that arrests might \"incite\" these trespassers.\n \n \nYou are trying REALLY HARD to make a mountain out of this molehill when, in fact, these people did nothing illegal, took pains to make sure they were not doing anything illegal, and even called and requested a police protest for crowd control. \n \n The only hard question here is \"how could any reasonably intelligent person be outraged at this\".\n\n If you do not think the average reader isn't horrified when reading this account, then you are sadly mistaken. It was in pure bad taste, putting the very best face on it! \n \n But more realistically, this was a Bully Tactic pure and simple. Everyone reading this gets the message Loud and Clear! We know exactly where you live! We know where your children are, and you wife too! \n \n Do you think this is fair? I ask again, what if things got out of hand. Put your self in the position of the residents on that street. You know, the only people who belonged there. The ONLY people paying taxes there. \n \n Then when the residents call their police they don't show up! Imagine the horror that set in for an upscale neighborhood, full of Police backers, and upstanding peaceful law-abiding citizens, who no longer are sure that if the stuff hits the fan, if the police they pay for, with their hard earned tax dollars, will ever come!\n \n Someone needs their butts kicked for this stunt! The DC Cops acted injudiciously, and did not follow proper procedures! \n \n No one wants a 14 bus loads of protesters, a 500 people protest to show up in their city, let alone on your street, or even worse on your front lawn, escorted by some other city's Cops. Who were the police protecting the protectors from? One Home Owner?\n \n And yes a law was broken. A protest is supposed to keep moving, but they are clearly stationary on but tarring up this guys lawn! They also showed up without notifying the other city, the cops, or even asking for a permit. Cops too! You Know, That pesky rule of Law thing! \n \n The PURE purpose was intimidation! We know where you and you family live! Now mess with us! And as Nena Easton put it, it seem to even work on her very own city's cops!\n \n You are DARN RIGHT I AM TICKED OFF!",

If that was true, why did they borrow the money? Were the leadership of SEIU betting against the members and using them thereby aiding in foreclosures? I say we foreclose SEIU...after the criminal and civil trials of course emoticon_smile\n \n \nThey were made to transport people. It does not matter who the people are, and if the school district can make extra money by renting them out, more power to them.\n \n \n You make the claim yet again yet you have no proof! You expect me to prove you right. My job is to make your comments look as stupid as they are and your claims a figment of your imagination which they probably are.\n \n \nAnd you dont recall ever seeing a non school meeting held at a school, or a boy scout event?\n\n \n What does this have to do with a radical, political group of malcontent government employees? Know what the HATCH ACT is? \n \n \nYou sound like an XXXXX.\n \n \n Oh, is little daewoosie losing it?

It is YOUR responsibility to provide evidence of this. I merely pointed out that you had no evidence of the claim you were making and that the far more likely explanation is that they rented the buses from the school.\n\n \n You made the claim no less than three(3) times. I am not responsible to prove your lies, you are! \n \n \nIf you want to continue your unsupported claim, YOU need to provide proof. Demanding that I come up with receipts is ludicrous, childish, and frankly only highlights the fact that you have no real argument here.\n \n \n It highlights the fact that you can't prove your claim all right and ignore the real problem that SEIU probably did criminal acts in a residential neighborhood and violated numerous criminal and civil laws!\n \n \nThat has nothing AT ALL to do with this. You really have NO IDEA what you are talking about or what happened during the financial crisis, do you? The \"bailout\" was not so much a bailout as it was a bridge loan. The fact that they repaid their government bridge loan is irrelevant and does not change the fact that they packaged and marketed hundreds of billions of dollars worth of securities as prime paper while also betting against them \n\n \n Yet SEIU took out a 90 million loan that has accrued at least 4 million in interest? Sounds like you got a problem all right, the hand that feeds your union is the BOA. You don't think they profited from betting against that paper do you?\n \n \nSorry. You still have got NOTHING but an apparent hatred for law abiding Americans exercising their constitutional rights.\n\n \n Your claim that what they did was law abiding. Most folks do not see it that way and they got a double standard. Good luck on the Court challenges. emoticon_smile My opinion is they are about to get slam dunked emoticon_xgood\n \n I see some news articles doing damage control today despite the undebunked statement that D.C. cops \"escourted\" the thugs to the home and are now claiming that they stopped at the jurisdictional boundries.
