   "Lawyer who worked with both President Bushes tried to kill wife: police\n By Ron Brynaert\n Thursday, January 7th, 2010 -- 4:19 pm\n Police say that a former White House lawyer who worked with both President Bushes tried to kill his wife. Along with trying to strangle her, he allegedly \"beat her with a metal flashlight until she lost consciousness,\" according to the affidavit quoted in multiple reports.\n \n \"John Michael Farren, 57, of New Canaan, was charged with attempted murder and first-degree strangulation after police received a panic alarm from his home shortly after 10 p.m.,\" Connecticut's NewsTimes reports. \"Farren was arraigned in state Superior Court in Norwalk Thursday. He appeared in court with a large bandage on the right side of his neck and has been placed on suicide watch.\"\n \n The report adds, \"Farren has served as general counsel and vice president of external affairs for Norwalk-based Xerox Corp. and served as Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade under President George H.W. Bush and in the White House counsel's office under President George W. Bush.\"\n\n Lawyer who worked with both President Bushes tried to kill wife: police | Raw Story\n \n Tsk! Tsk! Tsk!\n \n The most unfortunate Madame Farren was forced to flee with her children. She is suffering a broken jaw, a broken nose and numerous other injuries.\n \n What lovely behavior.",

Dispute these facts if you can. \n \n\n 40th anniversary of Mary Jo Kopechne's drowning at Chappaquiddick...Kennedy's story still doubtful \n July 17, 6:02 AM\n Norfolk Crime Examiner\n Dave Gibson\n \n Sometime around midnight, on July 18, 1969 Kennedy drove his Oldsmobile 88 off of a small bridge on Chappaquiddick island, into eight feet of chilly water. The vehicle landed upside-down. While Kennedy managed to free himself from the wreck and swim to safety, his passenger, 28-year-old Mary Jo Kopechne was left in the car to drown.\n \n Once he reached shore, Kennedy claims to have made seven or eight attempts to rescue Kopechne, but could not free her.\n \n Kennedy then walked back to the cottage where he and four other men, were partying with several young women known as the \"Boiler Room Girls\" who had worked on Robert Kennedy's campaign. Though Kennedy passed by a fire station and a private home to return to the cottage, he never stopped to ask for help for the trapped Kopechne.\n \n He returned to the party and according to Kennedy himself, informed his cousin and a friend of the situation. The two men, Joseph Gargan and Paul Markham claim to have returned to the scene of the accident and made several unsuccessful attempts to free Kopechne.\n \n Then Kennedy's story takes an even stranger turn.\n \n After the failed rescue attempts, Kennedy claims to have jumped back into the water and made the 500-foot swim across the channel back to Edgartown. He then walked back to his hotel and spent the night. He even took the time to change clothes and pay a visit to the front-desk, to complain about a noisy party--no doubt Kennedy's sloppy attempt at securing an alibi.\n \n The next morning, Gargan and Markham around 8:00 a.m., and were supposedly shocked to discover that Kennedy never reported the accident to police. According to Kennedy's own testimony, he told them: \"about my own thoughts and feelings as I swam across that channel ... that somehow when they arrived in the morning that they were going to say that Mary Jo was still alive\"\n \n The two men along with Kennedy went back to Chappaquiddick, where Kennedy spent some time making phone calls, seeking advice from various individuals as to how to proceed.\n \n Meanwhile, two fisherman had discovered the submerged car and notified police. At 8:45a.m. a diver recovered the lifeless body of Mary Jo Kopechne.\n \n It was not until 10a.m., over nine hours after driving-off of the bridge that Ted Kennedy went to the police station in Edgarton to report the accident.\n \n Kennedy then gave the following prepared statement to police: \"On July 18, 1969, at approximately 11:15 p.m. in Chappaquiddick, Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, I was driving my car on Main Street on my way to get the ferry back to Edgartown. I was unfamiliar with the road and turned right onto Dike Road, instead of bearing hard left on Main Street. After proceeding for approximately one-half mile on Dike Road I descended a hill and came upon a narrow bridge.\n \n The car went off the side of the bridge. There was one passenger with me, one Miss Mary [Kopechne], a former secretary of my brother Sen. Robert Kennedy. The car turned over and sank into the water and landed with the roof resting on the bottom. I attempted to open the door and the window of the car but have no recollection of how I got out of the car. I came to the surface and then repeatedly dove down to the car in an attempt to see if the passenger was still in the car. I was unsuccessful in the attempt. I was exhausted and in a state of shock.\n \n I recall walking back to where my friends were eating. There was a car parked in front of the cottage and I climbed into the backseat. I then asked for someone to bring me back to Edgartown. I remember walking around for a period and then going back to my hotel room. When I fully realized what had happened this morning, I immediately contacted the police\"\n \n In a move which must have been rather tortuous for her parents, Kennedy attended Mary Jo's funeral, wearing a neck brace (which he reportedly never wore again) and looking rather pathetic.\n \n The diver who recovered Kopechne's body, John Farrar testified at the official inquest that her body was found where the air pocket would have formed. He said: \"Had I received a call within five to ten minutes of the accident occurring, and was able, as I was the following morning, to be at the victim's side within twenty-five minutes of receiving the call, in such event there is a strong possibility that she would have been alive on removal from the submerged car.\"\n 40th anniversary of Mary Jo Kopechne?s drowning at Chappaquiddick...Kennedy's story still doubtful \n",

   "Well, then there's:\n \n\"Report Finds Fatal Crash Attributable to Mrs. Bush\"\n \n \"The wife of Gov. George W. Bush was responsible for a traffic accident that killed a high school classmate in Midland 37 years ago, according to a newly released accident report. Investigators said a 1963 Chevrolet driven by Mrs. Bush - then Laura Welch, a high school senior - ran a stop sign and struck a Chevrolet Corvair driven by Michael Douglas. Copies of the accident report - parts of which are illegible - were released Wednesday by Midland City Attorney Keith Stretcher after state Attorney General John Cornyn held that the information was public....Mr. Stretcher, the Midland city attorney, initially declined to release any information about the accident on the grounds that it involved minors and therefore was exempt from disclosure under the Texas\n Public Information Act. He also contended that disclosing the information would violate the parties' privacy rights. \n \n Police listed two violations as contributing to the accident, both by Mrs. Bush. One checked box read \"disregard stop sign or light,\" and the other was illegible....Both drivers were Robert E. Lee High School students.\n\n Pickles Bush - Questions Still Surround Laura Bush's Midland Tragedy\n \n Fortunately, Dick Cheney's drunk driving incidents didn't lead to any human deaths, but then they occurred in Wymoning which is big and wide and open, with a lot of empty roads.",
