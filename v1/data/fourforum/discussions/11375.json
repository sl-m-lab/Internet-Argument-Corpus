We're discussing a subject that is on par with defining the length of time that eternity encompasses. It is impossible for the human mind to comprehend it in this finite state of being. So it is with the essence of what makes us alive, and what part of us lives on after these bodies die. It is impossible to effectively define, so we call that essence/consciousness, our soul.
