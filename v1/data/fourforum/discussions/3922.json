   "...need to listen up!\n \n \n All you :xcensored atheists need to listen up!\n \n The Preamble to the Constitution of the United States should clue you in on the intent of this nation of people.\n \n Analyze it word by word and you may be astounded to conclude that you have been absolutely idiotic in your relentless quest to have God removed from the government of the people.\n \n Acknowledgement of our Creator being prohibited in government is anti-American for the simple reason that this existing nation was founded in the principles of Godliness.\n \n We, the people of the United States are a nation of people bound together by our liberty to generally do as we please without interference or control by a national church. We have all churches known to man. We worship when, where and how we please within the constraints of common decency and law.\n \n It was a revolt against the church, not against God, that led our leaders, in order to form a more perfect Union to establish a nation free of church rule and church \"justice\". The use of the word \"union\" implies a bond among the people. Its capitalization implies the importance of recognizing it as the basis of our country.\n \n To establish justice meant to separate the human frailties of church leaders and religious dogma from the government (and taxation) of the people.\n \n To insure domestic tranquility is no easy task especially when one has difficulty defining tranquility in other than relative terms. To guarantee our peace and provide for the common defense, a nation must maintain superior military forces compared to other nations. We intend to stay strong and capable of defeating any and all attacks on our Union.\n \n To promote the general welfare our government provides expenditure of funds for infrastructure and other needs common to the people of the Union. Just stop and think of all the government giveaway programs that we have leaching off the national treasury.\n \n To secure ourselves and the blessings of liberty that we enjoy as members of this Union requires law and military. Unfortunately for some, these bring the need for lawyers, law enforcement, trained and ready militia (minutemen) and a whole passel of superior weapons, technology and knowledge of our many enemies.\n \n If we stop and think to ourselves, though there is no joy in the killing of innocents, the defense of our Union against whatever challenges are met, must be a fight to the death. There is no joy in terrorist's attacks, the sole intents of which are to disturb the relative domestic tranquility.\n \n To recognize the enemies, we must identify ourselves and our posterity. Since we expect the government to protect us from any and all comers, we must give the government a lot of personal information. It's not any more personal than name, address, serial numbers, pin numbers, social security numbers, driver's license numbers, vehicle registration numbers, bank account numbers, recent photos, fingerprints, urine samples, blood samples, DNA samples, FBI files, court records, dental records, purchase records, surveillance videos, phone taps, interviews with neighbors and family members and such.\n \n The Who Why and What of the Preamble is completed with the action taken by us, the people of the United States. What did we do? It was to ordain our Constitution. To ordain means to invest officially (as by the laying on of hands) with ministerial or priestly authority. It implies the recognition of God and beseeches His blessing on the Union.\n \n We ordained the effort and then proceeded to write in our own language and establish the Constitution of the United States of America.\n \n \n God bless America!!! :xcensored Communism!!!\n \n \n All you :xcensored atheist activists can kiss my :xcensored !",

This is something that over 80% of the country opposes, not just the religous right. \n \n Granted the religous right latches on to these issues and declares themselves the protectors of the American peoples moral sensibilities, but this seems to be more of a publicity issue than a practical one.\n \n I think the real issue is that people see that our nation is in serious decline, even if they do not wish to acknowledge it. They are trying to \"fix\" what they see as the problem. \n \n Which side is right? I think neither. Our nation will not be saved by a return to religous based principals. Completley barring religoun is not likely to be effective either. For a LOT of years people got along just fine with MORE religoun in government than there is now, and your token athiest just closed their eyes to it or didn't participate. Everybody was fine with this. The problem seems to be the arrival of these fanatcis on the scene. It is never good to have fanatics running around, regardless of what it is they are fanatical about.\n \n This is one of those situations where an exceptionall small minority are making life difficult for the rest fo us. Keeping in mind that over 96% answer int he affermative when asked if they believe in god, it seems that if this is really an issue, we should simply be able to ammend the first ammendment to make it mroe clear. As an alternative, we could get some supreme court judges in there that have some cahones and are willing to take difficult cases.\n \n Froma realistic standpoint, we have no seperation of church and state in this country, nor did those who wrote our constitution expect for us to. The seperation of church and state that they spoke of in ammendment one was primarily a concern because as good british subjects, these guys were all required by law to be memebrs of the church of england. TO A MAN the founders advocated the use of the bible as a text book. While they were not all christians (most were diests), they were all \"god fearing\" men.\n \n This issue is just like our current second ammendment issues. Traditionally, the supreme court has relied heavily on original intent when interpeting the constitution. Our fonders were prone to writing long (and sometimes boring) narratives regarding their views and how they came to adopt the principals they included in the constitution. There is no doubt as to what they meant when drafting the second ammendment, and there is no doubt as to what they meant when drafting the first ammendment. \n \n Those who would claim that the constitution protects them from having to hear the word \"god\" in the pledge, or see a copy of the ten commandments in a courthouse are simply wrong. It provides no such protectiong. Those who would claim that the second ammendmnet allows for background checks and permit systems in relation to firearms are also wrong. It clearly permits no such restrictions.\n \n It has been a lot of years since we had a supreme court that was willing to take such politically charged cases.

   " This is one of those situations where an exceptionall small minority are making life difficult for the rest fo us. Keeping in mind that over 96% answer int he affermative when asked if they believe in god, it seems that if this is really an issue, we should simply be able to ammend the first ammendment to make it mroe clear. As an alternative, we could get some supreme court judges in there that have some cahones and are willing to take difficult cases.\n \n\n \n In the US those who believe in god are, depending on who's numbers you like, between 87 and 92% of the population (2002). That includes atheists who profess no belief in any god and agnostics who believe in a higher power but exclude biblical gods. Monotheists (belief in a god by Christian/Muslim/etc) are 53% of world population, followed by believers in reincarnation at 19%, ethno religions at 8%, atheists/agnostics at 14% and 6% undecided. While Christianity is touted as the world's largest belief system, once you take other numbers out of the equation it becomes clear that believing in a god and practicing religion are two entirely different subjects. \n \n The more informative numbers are in worship attendance, declining in all Christian groups for the past 50-years, attributed to a higher level of formal education less inclined to adhere to mythology as a lifestyle but retaining a belief in god from adolescent training and those estranged from the family ties once dominated by church attendance. Regular church attendance in the US is often stated as high as 40%, far higher than other Christian nations, by using 'special' holiday attendance such as easter and xmas and membership both active and inactive as published attendance numbers.\n \n Based on numbers I can accept the belief in God majority, but not specific federal legislation based on biblical mythology that eliminates states rights. Church attendance, worship, normally accepted as the mark of a true believer, just doesn't justify it. To me it looks like more of that same 'bring back the good old days' political blather and that just isn't going to happen. Our social structure has irrevocable changed to an extent that denies any ability of going back in time. Clinging to old dreams leaves little room for progress or new dreams.\n \n If anyone enjoys statistics, take a look at when Christianity is projected to decline from being the majority practiced US belief system in the US due to our social structure and continual influx of non-Christians with higher birth rates. The fastest growing religion in the US based on percentage of increase? Wiccan.",

   "OK Ron: I've read this post a couple of times, but I still can't quite see what you're driving at. What do you mean by a \"personalized belief system\" and can you say why a religious \"set of opinions\" separates God from man ? Isn't that statement itself an opinion about other people's opinions ?\n\n To better understand we have to look at the many denominations of only one religion, that being Christianity. One denomination claims that hell is a place where lost souls burn and are tortured forever; one teaches that it is figurative; while another refuses that the place really exists as a \"place\". With these different \"opinions\" arise much more rules and regulations to stay out of it or at least to bypass it.\n This one example holds true to love, hate, political office, prayer, tithes, offerings, curse words, kissing, fornication, adultery, sex, eating and drinking, etc.\n \n The same rules, regulations, methods, and rites that God intend for us to follow, the religionists distort them into whatever agenda is deemed important for them, making the Word of God a stumbling block (1 Peter 2 : 8 ) while, simultaneously, are unaware that the Word of God is making them stumble. They use scripture to justify slavery, to substantiate \"racial pride\", to degrade women, to gain access to public office, to promote mutual hate, etc.\n \n Even in the days when Paul preached, the \"Church\" was filled with those that confused the word of God in order to make it line up with their schema of the day.\n \n I know it sounds derogatory, and it may seem foolish to even dispute it, but man has made religion so hateful that the only way to look at it from a Christian's view is the expose it for what it really is - an opinion of selfish minions.",

   "The use of the word god was to simply say:\n We bow to no man.\n \n Jefferson wanted to make it clear to England that their precious nobility and birthright held no sway over our rights, granted not by noble men, but by something outside of man...which conceptually is quite rational (concepts, for instance). And further, the ruler of our land, or rulers (3 houses), despite being in charge, STILL couldn't remove our basic freedoms, because they were granted outside the grasp of man. Makes sense.\n \n Who do we say we bow to if it's not man? Something above man. Enter \"god\".\n \n Maybe we should ammend it to define God as it was by Jefferson, and the phrase used to mention it:\n \n which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them,  \n \n IT WAS THE NOTION OF A DEIST GOD.\n \n Jefferson would loathe the christian coalition and religious fundamentalism. He supported science as the method of understanding the god of nature. In that respect, I have far less of an issue with the word \"god\". Is this how you interperet it?\n \n As long as it's known to be as the above, it's not in need of change IMO.\n \n ================================\n \n  Deism is defined in Webster's Encyclopedic Dictionary, 1941, as: \"[From Latin Deus, God Deity] The doctrine or creed of a Deist.\" And Deist is defined in the same dictionary as: \"One who believes in the existence of a God or supreme being but denies revealed religion, basing his belief on the light of nature and reason.\"  \n \n http://www.nobeliefs.com/jefferson.htm\n http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/document/index.htm\n \n Although Jefferson believed in a Creator, his concept of it resembled that of the god of deism (the term \"Nature's God\" used by deists of the time). With his scientific bent, Jefferson sought to organize his thoughts on religion. He rejected the superstitions and mysticism of Christianity and even went so far as to edit the gospels, removing the miracles and mysticism of Jesus (see The Jefferson Bible) leaving only what he deemed the correct moral philosophy of Jesus.\n \n Distortions of history occur in the minds of many Christians whenever they see the word \"God\" embossed in statue or memorial concrete. For example, those who visit the Jefferson Memorial in Washington will read Jefferson's words engraved: \"I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every from of tyranny over the mind of man.\" When they see the word \"God\" many Christians see this as \"proof\" of his Christianity without thinking that \"God\" can have many definitions ranging from nature to supernatural.\n \n Yet how many of them realize that this passage aimed at attacking the tyranny of the Christian clergy of Philadelphia, or that Jefferson's God was not the personal god of Christianity? Those memorial words came from a letter written to Benjamin Rush in 1800 in response to Rush's warning about the Philadelphia clergy attacking Jefferson (Jefferson was seen as an infidel by his enemies during his election for President). The complete statement reads as follows:\n \n \"The returning good sense of our country threatens abortion to their hopes, & they [the clergy] believe that any portion of power confided to me, will be exerted in opposition to their schemes. And they believe rightly; for I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man. But this is all they have to fear from me: & enough too in their opinion, & this is the cause of their printing lying pamphlets against me. . .\"\n \n -Mach",

   "I've already mentioned life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. My pursuit of happiness includes reference to God. Our founder's pursuit of happiness included reference to God. The great majority of our population includes God in their pursuit of happiness.\n \n It's the cry baby atheists who want to have that reference taken away. Not believing in God and insisting that God be removed from government are too different things. That's like moving to a foreign country and insisting they change their language.\n \n Screw the activist atheists.\n\n \n Who are these activist atheists? What do they want? I can see good reason in removing references to God on our currency and our pledge, which is what the atheist activists want. I have heard, however, of some atheist activists who want to make it illegal for legislators to make decisions based on religion. That is what I disagree with. If a legislator votes for a theocratic law, the law itself must be attacked, not the legislator's motives. We can't change the motives of legislators. A legislator can pass an anti-murder law based on the most absurd divinations, but that doesn't change the fact that an anti-murder law is good.",

   "In order to understand it better, most people (including the religious folks) need to understand the very thin ice these founders were treading on.\n \n First of all they couldn't allow their belief system to overtake their total and unadulterated love of country...and a new one at that. They realized that one day this country might get involved with a ONE-GOD populace that just might revert back to total church control. I can only imagine the pains that some went through by not penning in the name of Jesus Christ, but they had to just choke it down and forget about it. They had to make this nation free and to do so they had to leave out A CERTAIN GOD...period. Again, the torment some had to go through was enormous, I believe.\n \n I would like to say for the record that this is not a Christian Nation, but that it is, without doubt, a nation (almost) full of Christians.\n \n Sorry to upset the Falwellians.\n \n Endowed by our Creator is just them trying to say that only the Supreme of the Supreme could take away our rights.\n \n Hey, the truth is out there.\n \n I know another PM is coming my way, but I can't help but feel some religious beliefs are just as bad as taking away Christmas in New Jersey. What a bunch of Scroogeian Grinches.\n\n \n But I disagree, politely with Big Orn :)\n \n I think the literal words used \"Laws of Nature and Nature's God\" is very specific as the god of the author, a deist. Jefferson thought of Jesus Christ as an important philosopher, not as divinity, I don't think he was itching to jot his name down. The Declaration of Independance isn't a legal document, it's not what our constitution is based on, it's not what our government is based on. It served a purpose, to declare our indpendance from english nobility (and everyone else for that matter), that is all. I agree in that it was important to make sure we defined our rights as being granted by \"no human\", and thus no human could take them away. I don't think there was a more eloquent way, at that time, to do so.\n \n The consititution, notably, does not contiain the word \"god\" for a reason. It's a secular government, by intent, and by design. The beauty of our freedom is that you're free to have faith and go to church, and no one is able to prevent that. To FORCE religion, would be less free, thus, we have the most free government we could concieve with respect to religion, or lack of religion for that matter. How great is that?\n \n \n -Mach",

There's no doubt that the documents are Deist in nature, they directly attribute our rights to a higher power, but all this arguing about exactly who or what the founding fathers believed in is completely pointless IMHO, the fact is, there is no right answer, and that's not by accident.\n \n The addition of \"God\" in the 1950's in no way impacts what was originally written IMHO. It can be written out just as easily as it was written in.\n \n When it comes right down to it, I don't think the \"pro-God\" side really has a leg to stand on other than \"it's always been that way\".

I think it's a pretty clear reflection on the poster.\n \n Anyhoo, it's been fun, it's certainly helped me kill the excruciating final hours in the office before I get to go on holidays for 2 weeks. :p I'm outta here for the holidays at noon. emoticon_xagree emoticon_xbye \n \n In all honesty, I hope you and your family have a very enjoyable and safe Christmas and New Years.\n \n Waxy",
