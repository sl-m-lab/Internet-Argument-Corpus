   "There has been some interesting economic news out the last few days that bears review. First of all, wholesale inventories jumped 1.1%. They were expected to rise .5%. Also January's number was raised to 1.3%. Previously it was at .6%. This is BAD BAD news and here is why:\n \n Typically gains in wholesale inventories pretty much mean that the economy is slowing and exports are slowing. Wholesalers are having trouble getting the fecal matter out the door. This is particular disturbing right now because of the large back to back declines we have seen in both payrolls and manufacturing data. The manufacturing sector has made significant cutbacks, and still we can not move even the reduced inventory. This will probably mean more cutbacks in the manufacturing sector and more job losses showing up in our next NFP data set. Factory inventories also came in up .5% on the second, which has the same implications. This will actually give GDP numbers a boost for the first quarter, but will detract heavily from following quarters.\n \n This leads to the second interesting little tidbit:\n \n http://www.cnbc.com/id/23994721\n \n \nU.S. Sliding into Recession: Head of Economic Bureau\n \n Martin Feldstein, who heads the group that is considered the arbiter of U.S. recessions, told CNBC that he believes the U.S. has been sliding into a recession since December or January. \n \n \"I think the professional forecasters have been a little slow to come to the recognition that we're in a recession,\" Feldstein said in a live interview.\n \n Feldstein, president of the National Bureau of Economic Research, said the downturn could go on longer and deeper than the two most recent recessions.\n\n \n This is interesting in and of itself...the guy who heads the group that decides when we are in recession thinks we are in one and that it will be worse than the last 2.\n \n Here is the really interesting part:\n \n \nHe also said the U.S. gross domestic product would be a misleading, positive number.\n\n \n WOW. This is a MAJOR victory for the folks in Washington who have worked so hard to revise the way our economic numbers are calculated to the point that they are meaningless. While it has long been theoretically possible to be in a recession without negative GDP numbers, it was theoretically possible the way time travel is theoretically possible but they have finally managed to get the numbers \"revised\" to the point that they pretty much mean nothing at all!! Exciting stuff! Now that the numbers no longer have any relationship to reality, they can pound sunshine relentlessly up the publics anal orifices at will!! Isn't that nice? The middle class will all be living in cardboard boxes and boiling their old boots to make soup, but the numbers can show the greatest economic expansion in the history of the nation. That will make people feel MUCH better when they are pimping out their wives!",

   "Unrelated by funny: \n \n about oil prices: \n \n \n``OPEC has lost control of the oil market to institutional investors who are looking for a sanctuary from the weak dollar and slowing economy,'' said Richard Chimblo, manager of global business development at Calgary-based Genoil Inc. ``I believe the bubble will break and prices are going to fall to the $85 area before the winter heating season.''\n\n \n Last time I heard this was when they said the bubble would break and prices would settle at $60 a barrel. As a result they immediately went to $90 I think.\n \n In fact, take a look at some of our recent discussions:\n \n \nOk, somebody HAS to say something about $70 oil, I suppose it will be me.\n \n I think it is still unerpriced.\nhttp://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=208140&postcount=1\n \n \n\n \nHistorically, it is not yet at its highest level adjusted for inflation. That would have been about 1981 or thereabouts. So anyone arguing that the price is due to a weak dollar merely has a weak mind. It's supply and demand.\n\n \n You might want to call OPEC and let them know, becuase the adjusted thier target price from $30 to $50....the reason they gave was the weak dollar.\n\n http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=208405&postcount=5\n \n \nSuppose the price climbs to $100 and beyond - it's not just the increased cost of fuel at the pumps that we'll have to worry about.\n\n \n We are well over $100....lets look to $150 oil :)",

And they blame a rapidly growing and increasingly troubled sector of the F.H.A.'s mortgage portfolio, known as the seller-financed down payment loan program, which has suffered from high delinquency and foreclosure rates in recent years.\n \n If the program continues without any changes, Congressional officials say, the F.H.A. would face a $1.4 billion shortfall in fiscal 2009. This would mean that Congress - and American taxpayers - would have to subsidize the F.H.A. for the first time.\n \n \"These types of loans have pushed F.H.A. to the brink of insolvency,\" Alphonso R. Jackson, the housing secretary, told senators recently. \"They are costing hard-working Americans their homes.\" Mr. Jackson announced last week that he would resign his post as of April 18.\n\n \n Increased responsibility/market share for the FHA has pretty much been at the center of every plan floated by bush or congress to bolster the housing market. Apparently none of them noticed that the FHA is nearly BANKRUPT. \n \n This is one big problem with this particular downturn. Since the government is in such terrible shape financially it seriously hampers their ability to take any meaningful action in the face of our current economic situation. \n \n \nAny option now (such as letting the interest rate go up or tax increases..etc) will pretty much tank us further but probably will at least clean the wound. I'm actually starting to get a little worried about my recent home purchase. It seemed like a good time since I'm moving but this could have been a big mistake.\n\n \n My brother called this morning and wanted to know if he had made a mistake. I had to tell him \"too close to call\". \n \n I am starting to wonder what kind of crack the FOMC is smoking. They are so far behind the curve it is not even funny. While the minutes they just released were probably closer to reality than anything they have released to date, they were still talking about a \"potential\" self perpetuating downward spiral. Bad news, boys, it is HERE and there is no \"potential\" about it.\n \n Also interesting:\n \n http://www.reuters.com/article/bondsNews/idUSL0986366320080409\n \n \nLONDON/NEW YORK, April 9 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve is considering contingency plans to bolster its lending power, in case measures it has taken to rescue the troubled credit markets fail, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.\n \n One option being considered is to have the Treasury borrow more money than it needs to fund the government and keep the proceeds on deposit at the Federal Reserve, the report said.\n \n Other options include issuing debt under the Federal Reserve's name instead of the Treasury's, and asking Congress for immediate authority for the Fed to pay interest on commercial bank reserves rather than waiting until a law enacted earlier allows it to in 2011, according to the newspaper.\n\n \n THIS should be todays big news headline because you and I both knows that it means the fed is about out of money. I think that a lot of people (maybe even most) do not realize that the fed carries a balance sheet like any other organization. Going into the current crisis they had about $800 billion in liquid assets. They are down to about $200 billion in liquid assets. A lot of folks have effectively been fooled by the fact that the fed requires 100% collateralization on loans, so their total balance sheet never really changes, since they send out $100 billion, and take in $100 billion in sub prime trash as collateral their balance sheet does not really change, just their liquid assets, and they are down to $200 billion or less in liquid assets.",

You would not believe how much he tried to lord that over me. Finally I ended up posting several quotes from here (and linking directly to here in an attempt to get 4 forums some new traffic :) ) and people pretty much laughed him down. Keep in mind that when I was saying we would probably never see it under $60 again, he was predicting a crash back to $30. I actually did very well with the long term contracts I bought at $64 and later sold at $98. \n \n The swear filter prevents me from giving a full an unbiased view of the economy given some of the new data out this week (including oil production data), but \"screwed\" does not even begin to cover it. One way or another, I can tell you that the world my children know at my age will be VASTLY different from the world we see today.

   "The dynamics of the last \"boom\" make a long \"limping along\" period pretty difficult to imagine. I ran across this article just a little while ago:\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/09/business/09leonhardt.html?em&ex=1207886400&en=37ecbcf28a0d85b5&ei=5087%0A\n \n \nFor Many, a Boom That Wasn't\n \n How has the United States economy gotten to this point?\n \n It's not just the apparent recession. Recessions happen. If you tried to build an economy immune to the human emotions that produce boom and bust, you would end up with something that looked like East Germany.\n \n The bigger problem is that the now-finished boom was, for most Americans, nothing of the sort. In 2000, at the end of the previous economic expansion, the median American family made about $61,000, according to the Census Bureau's inflation-adjusted numbers. In 2007, in what looks to have been the final year of the most recent expansion, the median family, amazingly, seems to have made less - about $60,500.\n\n \n The consumer spending component of the economy has remained a relatively static 70% so if wages are not increasing that can only mean that much of the economic expansion we have seen over the last decade or so has been based primarily on debt. That tracks with what we know about private debt holdings in the US. Americans, especially the middle class, are up to their eyeballs in debt. While you can drag out an economic decline for a very long time, you cannot drag out a debt implosion like a typical economic decline. Debt expansion eventually hits a brick wall and you get an abrupt \"correction\". \n \n We are seeing this in the mortgage market right now. Mortgage defaults have not crept up a percent or two at time, they have jumped by double digits. Credit card defaults are starting to do the same, due in no small part to the fact that (as utterly moronic as it may be) a lot of people have been charging the bejesus out of their credit cards and then refinancing their homes every year to clear the cards. Now that the refi tap has been turned off, a lot of people have been caught with credit card debts that they cannot possibly afford. \n \n The bad thing is that we have not even SEEN recession yet and its effect on your average American. We have seen a few jobs lost, but nothing big yet. As the effects of recession set in and more people lose their jobs, etc... we will see more defaults, which will lead to tighter lending, which will lead to further economic slowdown, etc... We have already seen the beginning of the spiral.",

   "I see a long limping along period because Rome did the same thing. Granted they lasted longer than us but we will still have a good 50-100 years to limp before we go the way of the Romans.

This is based on just history. Even the short term events have taken slightly longer than you expected (in some cases). Americans are slow to realize :)\n\n \n This is true, and public perception is an important part of this. \n \n I was looking at retail sales data this mornign and basically it came in about where I expected. Retail sales pretty much blew monkey chunks except for China mart and chinaco (wal mart and Costco). I did not even bother to check the stock market (I often don't since I have no money there). When I finally did get around to taking a look I was pretty shocked to see that the market had actually risen and the increased sales of cheap chinese #### at wal mart and costco were given as primary reasons.\n \n HUH?\n \n Somebody is going to have to explain to me how data that shows that the only way to expand your sales currently is to be a front for chinese manufacturers is GOOD. Even at Wally world discretionary sales dropped through the floor.\n \n I just got off the phone with a broker friend of mine. He is not your typical broker (or I would not be able to stand him). He refers to his clients as \"those stupid monkeys that pay me\". Basically I wanted to know why in the world the market rallied on news like this. He said there are 3 things to consider:\n \n 1. \"According to recent test result when it comes to economics your average American does not know a dollar bill from a donkey dick\"\n 2. There is a prevailing sense among smaller investors that things \"can't get much worse\" so any news that might possibly be construed as \"good\" is getting a LOT of attention while any news that is bad is being ignored. He then cited some suicide stats from 1929-1930 which seemed to indicate that maybe things CAN get worse, and that investors should read #1 above.\n 3. it is a loosely held secret that MOST of the $200 billion that investments banks have been borrowing from the fed are going into liquid investments, and a lot of that money is ending up in equity markets. Apparently a lot of brokers bet pretty heavily on that happening and it paid out well for them. Unfortunately that money all has to go BACK to the fed after 90 days, so we will be seeing another big pullout. It is also apparently understood that the investment banks in question expected more than the dead cat bounce they got from that cash injection into equity markets and if things do not pick up, a lot of them are going to be in BIG trouble when it is time to repay the fed.\n \n #3 was particularly interesting to me because I had not considered that angle before. \n \n But, with market and consumer sentiment being such a big component of this, we will just have to wait and see. You may well be right.",

   "Damn it! According to IMF, that's a real serious problem for eastern european countries! \n Not too long ago Telegraph.co.uk published an telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2008/04/09/ccimf209.xml devoted to growing risk of a hard landing of banks in eastern europe as the world's financial crisis is spreading wider. \n \n \nCurrent account deficits have reached extreme levels across much of the ex-Soviet bloc, hitting 22.9pc in Latvia, 21.4pc in Bulgaria, 16.5pc in Serbia, 16pc in Estonia, 14.5pc in Romania and 13.3pc in Lithuania.\n The IMF said lenders in Eastern Europe had built up \"large negative net foreign positions\" during the boom, especially in the Baltic states. \"Liquidity for these banks has all but dried up and [interest] spreads have widened 500 basis points.\"\n Many of these countries rely on credit from branches of West European and Nordic banks, but these foreign lenders are having difficulty raising money on the global capital markets.\n \"A soft landing for the Baltics and south-eastern Europe could be jeopardised if external financing conditions force parent banks to contract credit to the region. Swedish banks, the main suppliers of external funding to the Baltics, could come under pressure,\" it said.\n So far, capital flows into these markets have held up well, often supported by the \"carry trade\" from Japan, Switzerland, and now the US. This may prove fragile.\n\n \n I wonder in this respect why eastern european banks don't start co-operating with Russian lenders. Within recent years they have become reliable enough and are practically irrespective of current banking situation in the US, Switzerland, or Japan. However it looks like that the government of the Baltic states is not governed by common sense, but the ambitions. As a result of that, the private interests in those countries would start to suffer very soon. And yet, as distinguished from other Baltic states, Poland seems to have drawn necessary conclusions. Even ex-president of Poland Lech Walesa said the other day in an interview that \"Poland should be patching up reasonable relations with Russia\". That means dealing with Russia and doing business.",

   "Hello forum! I guess many would agree with me when I say that the whole EU would breathe a sigh of relief if Ukraine re-joins Russian Federation, or at least joins the Union State of Russia and Belarus (by the way, Kazakhstan has just expressed interest in fully joining the Union). \n As things go, it is beyond dispute that Ukraine has become a serious threat to oil and gas transit to EU states, and thus to energy security of EU. Present-day Ukraine is distracted by acute economic problems that are likely to keep growing in case Ukraine joins NATO. Besides poor economics, that country is characterized by endless political squabbles, which also affects European energy security. Two highest state officials of Ukraine - president Yushchenko and PM Timoshenko - are preoccupied not with preparations for the following winter season when gas price should be twice as high, but 2009-2010 president election campaign. As this takes place, each of them try to use the gas issue to achieve some of their own goals, which means that what happened in 2006 (Ukraine was pumping EU-bound gas and certain European states short-received some 100m cubic meters of gas) may well happen again.",

   "Hey! Perhaps I will disappoint many optimists when I say that oil prices are going to rise all over again, experts say. Indeed, let us put off rose-coloured spectacles to see what's happening. OPEC is slowly reducing oil production when various countries with rapidly developing economy (such as China in the first place and India) are steady increasing oil consumption. Now there is also the USA that is refilling its national oil storage reserve. It's clear that less free oil is on the market when demand is amplifying. As a result, oil prices go up! I reckon that this very moment is best for buying oil futures as oil prices are at their minimal level right now, they won't go down anymore but will go up quite soon! Seize the occasion!",
