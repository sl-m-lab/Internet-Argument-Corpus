I think the best political opportunity for the US public is an independent party that accept our economic demise and puts the country first in terms of civil liberties and fiscal responsibility. That'll be a long, uphill effort, but hopefully America's youth will become disillusioned with my generation raiding public funds for personal gain to the point of relearning what voting actually means. Other than morality issues I can't ascertain any difference between contemporary democrats or republicans.",
