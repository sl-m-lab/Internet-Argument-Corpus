Talk about a nice dish of bias!\n \n If you had followed the link you would have seen that it wasn't an editorial, but a news article, a biography. Further, if you had read the article you would have seen that it paints a generally positive picture of Roberts.\n \n Or was that supposed to be your point? You don't like Roberts, so anything that speaks well of him is biased? Or does it not matter what the article actually says? If it's in the Times you just automatically disregard it?",
