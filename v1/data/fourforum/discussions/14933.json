   "New Ala. gov: Just Christians are his family\n \n By JAY REEVES, Associated Press Jay Reeves, Associated Press - Tue Jan 18, 11:39 pm ET\n \n BIRMINGHAM, Ala. - Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley told a church crowd just moments into his new administration that those who have not accepted Jesus as their savior are not his brothers and sisters, shocking some critics who questioned Tuesday whether he can be fair to non-Christians.\n \n \"Anybody here today who has not accepted Jesus Christ as their savior, I'm telling you, you're not my brother and you're not my sister, and I want to be your brother,\" Bentley said Monday, his inauguration day, according to The Birmingham News.\n \n -snip-\n \n \"If the Holy Spirit lives in you that makes you my brothers and sisters. Anyone who has not accepted Jesus, I want to be your brothers and sisters, too,\" Bentley said\n \n New Ala. gov: Just Christians are his family - Yahoo!

Good job Gov!\n \n I really don't buy the argument that this violates the first amendment, but what an XXXXX.",

   "Now granted, it is Alabama...but really? What a way to start, alienate 16% of your population. Good job Gov!\n \n I really don't buy the argument that this violates the first amendment, but what an XXXXX.\n\n \n I don't think it's a First Amendment violation, either. But it's certainly not a view that I find remotely acceptable in an elected official I'd consider voting for. Honestly, it's people like this guy who are the reason why I refuse to vote for the GOP anymore.\n \n Despite my generally liberal political outlook, I do agree with an occasional piece of the more conservative agenda. In my home state of Indiana, I have long respected Senator Richard Lugar. While I don't always agree with him, I think he can be trusted to do what is best for the country, and I've voted for him in the past. But I recently reached the conclusion that I could no longer vote for him, because in doing so, I'm also voting for a Senate with greater Republican influence, perhaps even with Republican control. And unfortunately, the national party has lurched so far to the right on social issues, that is simply no longer remotely acceptable to me. In the wake of the New York mosque debate last year, I emailed Lugar and explained that I could no longer vote for him, not because of him, but because of his party. (Ever the responsible public servant, I did hear back from him.)\n \n Until the Republican party kicks out the theocrats, I'm done with them.",
