   "And if you do go to hell if you do not love god is he really worthy of worship?\n\n I think this is definitely one of the main motivations right here. people sometimes worship God out of a fear of going to hell. I mean, if hell really existed as stated, then whether God was worthy or not, it would be in your best interested to get with the program and worship\n \n the other, more common, reason is that people who worship God love him, for the fact that he is God and for the fact that He loved them first. this is a bit more solid as a rationale.\n \n \nAny kind of god that demanded worship is, in my opinion, not worthy of it.\n\n point taken, but you can be worthy of recognition/praise and expect it, even to the point that youd be pretty upset if you didnt get it. imagine doing something really great for someone, and they never were grateful or even recognized your efforts...\n \n on the other hand, in any relationship where love is involved, one party worshiping the other always ends up in a one-sided unbalanced relationship, because by worshiping the other party you demean yourself to a servant status. this can work against you, because you have to put you total trust that the other person wont take advantage of you\n \n then again, its God. so as far as trust is concerned this is no problem. people that worship God are absolutely convinced that God seeks their best interest. and likewise, they are convinced by positioning themselves as servant status, they are also in the best position to recieve both the instructions of God and the blessings of God",

I disagree with this for starters. I also broke off from that part of the debate by claiming that God's version of rulership is horrible if done on Earth even if he was worthy of all the worship he demanded. What do you have to say about this?\n \n To back up my claims that a want is a weakness lets look to the definition of the word. \"A state of extreme poverty\", \"the state of needing something that is absent or unavailable\", \"anything that is necessary but lacking\", \"a specific feeling of desire\". So is God in a state of extreme poverty? If so he surely is in a state of weakness. Is he in need of something that he in his all powerful nature cannot take care of? If so then he is weak. Is he in need of something that is lacking? If he needs something which he himself cannot provide then he is weak. Does have feel a desire to have something which his all powerful nature cannot provide? If so then he is displaying a weakness. On the other hand if he is just choosing to need something which his all powerful nature can take care of then what he is essentially doing is demanding that humans do what he could do all by himself and therefore actually burdening us for his own lazyness. For example, lets say I could make all the food I wanted just by thinking about it but instead of doing that I forced comparitively weaker and inferior beings to get food for me. Wouldn't that be one way to show how nice of a being I am. Then again I would be dependent on them for food at that time so I would be displaying a weakness even if there really wasn't a weakness to be displayed in which case I'm simply displaying laziness. Either way it doesn't make me look so powerful and great now does it? That is your God. Ruler of the human race demanding of them to love him because he either has a weakness in doing this himself or is too lazy to fulfill his own needs. Based on the fact that we are created in his image and have a drive to fulfill our own needs I would have to debate that since God is not fulfilling his own needs that he does infact have a weakness that cannot be filled without the help of humans hence the reason he would have created us.",

   "AMD: Your last definition is acceptable. Where does it say that this is a weakness? God did not lack love. In fact, he had so much love that he created man to share it. He created that which was lacking so that it may also be made full (complete, or perfect). I am still looking for why this is a weakness. This is a judgement call on your part. There is nothing in any of the definitions you provided to say that those things are in and of themselves bad. The definition that says extreme poverty is not really close to the mark of what we have been discussing. That is a metaphorical usage. The other three are different.\n \n You have not put the matter to rest. You have completely not addressed it.\n\n \n I hope you still plan on responding to my previous post.\n \n But anyways I wasn't trying to put this matter to rest in one post.

I am actually giving several possible reasons as to why he doesn't just fulfill his own wants. One possibility is that he is lazy. One possibility is because he can't and needs us to in which case he is weak. One possibility is that he doesn't know how and in which case he is weak.

I would only ask that you show me a reaons why he doesn't fulfill his own needs while not looking lazy or weak in the process. I don't think there is a good reason hence I am of the assumption that he is lazy or weak and possibly even evil as a result, but I could be completely wrong in all these assumptions.\n \n \nAs for God forcing us to do his whims, I think we have been down this road before. if it was not you I apologize.\n\n \n I've been down this road before and know where you want to take it. You want to claim that he is not forcing us to do anything yet you will not respond to my previous question. If Bush was to demand that you worship him or live a life of misery would you say that he is forcing us to do something? Isn't God doing this exact thing and you are not stating that he is forcing you to do something?\n \n \nGod does not force us. He does say if you do x then y will happen.

The punishment for failure is the ultimate one. It would be like the father in your scenario killing the kid for not getting the paper or feeding the dog. Is that really love from God? Is that God not forcing us to do anything? If you had your life threatened if you didn't do something and the guy threatening you said he wasn't making any demands at all of you do you think he would sound a little crazy? This is how you sound to me when you are trying to explain how God is not forcing you to do anything. He is threatening everything about you in order to get you to do something yet you don't believe he is forcing anything. Sure he is not going to control you to do something unwillingly but this is practically what he is able to do simply by threatening what he does! It is rediculous! If your father was to threaten you with death or torture for the rest of your life if you didn't feed the dog I'm sure you would feed that dog every day because you would have no choice whatsoever. God is the father! What a nice guy he is not forcing us to do anything we don't want to, right?",

What is the purpose of human life if he can simply satisify his own needs if he wants to while allowing all those he loved to come directly to him and live forever along side of him? To put this in worldly terms, this would be like you buying a computer that you really wanted and let it set in a room for three years virtually untouched. You couldn't use it for your purpose but you could do some maintence if necessary. If the computer didn't crash in this three year period too many times then you would actually start using it otherwise you would burn it. Wouldn't it make more sense to skip that three year period and simply start getting your use out of it while giving the computer a whole lot more purpose? This is the whole reason it makes no sense for humans to be here if God loves and is able to fulfill his own needs without us being here which an all powerful being would be able to do.

You are simply going to learn based on what others around you display especially your parents. I don't consider this brainwashing. I think brainwashing is an intentional and forceful way to get someone to accept new ideas.

To put this in worldly terms, this would be like you buying a computer that you really wanted and let it set in a room for three years virtually untouched. You couldn't use it for your purpose but you could do some maintence if necessary. If the computer didn't crash in this three year period too many times then you would actually start using it otherwise you would burn it. Wouldn't it make more sense to skip that three year period and simply start getting your use out of it while giving the computer a whole lot more purpose? This is the whole reason it makes no sense for humans to be here if God loves and is able to fulfill his own needs without us being here which an all powerful being would be able to do. Also if he was perfect he would develop an entirely new system that is a whole lot more efficient than the one he has today.\n \n \n \n If he can do such amazing things then how come he has us here in order to do his work for him? That is not perfection by any means. Perfection is an ideal instance. With his instance his needs are not being fulfilled without the help of others and he needs to threaten those others in order to get his needs fulfilled. If you had a car that would only work if you threatened it with removing its oil would you have an ideal car? Also if you were a God and had to depend on a questionable car just to get around would you call this an ideal instance?\n \n The deal with Abraham would have no impact on this debate as far as I can tell unless you are suggesting that God is worthy of worship due to the fact that he tells you to do counter productive thing. I think that actually goes against the worthiness of God to be worshipped.\n\n \n Actually I has reading a watchtower. It brought out that God was probally alone for a long time in idle bliss. Then out of \"love\" he started creating. What you discribe is what we believe. God being perfect does not need to create people to worship him, and can preoccupy himself in self absorbtion. \n Since he did create people it is illogical for him to like them if they decide to make him unhappy. \n \n The concept is he only wants pcs that never crash and cars that always run. Remember humans never got past the prototype stage. He made two and they both broke. If that pc or car was the first prototype then questioning the origin of failure is your job. BTW he is perfect and believes things fail on purpose to make him angry unless proven otherwise.",

   "I've been trying to make epaphras see this for a few posts now. If you are given the option of do nothing and be tortured or love me and be happy then you are essentially being given no choice at all. Free will is destroyed when these types of options are present. You can surely find statistical data that will show when given the option of work and extreme success or laziness and extreme pain that almost 100% of all people will choose work and success. There just is no option here. One good pole here would be the one taken before the invasion of Iraq. Saddam was voted by 100% of the population to be their president. Good old Saddam took a lesson from the book of God for that election.\n\n \n It is not forced. Coerced perhaps (if we assume your understanding of god) but still the choice is yours. Free will does not mean that one gets to do what ever one wants at any time and any place. Free will is simply the ability to act in accordance with your nature. The ability to make a choice. Free will does not define the choices. God is good and loving. \n \n You say a God that loves would not even allow a hell. Do you not see, that if there is no hell then you have no choice but heaven? Where is the free will in that? You get no choice. You don't like God? Tough you have to go to heaven any way. Deal with it. That is not choice, free will or anything like it. \n \n God desires no one to go to hell. He wants all to go to heaven, but he will not force it. Why, why, why why would he send his only son to die the torturous death on the cross, to be beaten and ridiculed, and to suffer our sinful presence if he did not love us? Don't you see that Before there was a death on the cross all men were doomed to ritual sacrifices to appease God for a time. They could not please God as evidenced by the sacrifice being required every year. It only appeased him. Christ's death was satisfying of the wrath of God for the sin of man. The sin man chose. If the option wasn't there THEN we have no choice. Christ's death has given us the option we never had before.",

   "Either brainwashing is a necessary part of human life or that really isn't a case of brainwashing. For one if this is brainwashing then believing that your country is a great country is brainwashing, believing that your language or culture is important or that your money is actually worth something is brainwashing. You are simply going to learn based on what others around you display especially your parents. I don't consider this brainwashing. I think brainwashing is an intentional and forceful way to get someone to accept new ideas. If your culture is going to look down on religion they are not really forcefully or intentionally teaching you to not be religious either although that is likely what you will pick up about it. So more than anything I think this shows that humans are social creatures who learn based on what they see others around them are doing and nothing more.\n\n So saying to, particularly a child, worship god or go to hell, is not brainwashing. If you believe you country is the best in the world is either ignorance or patriotism, thats not brainwashing.\n \n Take for example suicide bombers, they believe they will go to heaven if they carry out there mission, thats also brainwashing, would a patriot do something like that? I dont think so. \n \n Its interesting to note my earlier post, in places where theres no or little religious education, theres a lower number of religious people.",

But that is just my opinion based on the fact that he should be all knowing, all powerful, and perfect. Do you see a flaw in my logic?\n \n Why did he need to send Jesus here in the first place is the real question. He planned for it to be this way otherwise it wouldn't have happened. He created something that was flawed in many ways, just as he intended it to be. It would be his own choice and he made the choice long before sending Jesus to Earth. Also know that sending Jesus to die would be like me sending my program to die by infecting with a virus while I know full good and well that I have a backup copy. God never sacraficed anything by sending Jesus here. The whole idea of this creating a family was his idea, not something that he was born with like we no Earth are. He created this system so it probably means very little to him in the first place especially when he knows that he cannot lose what he creates. It's like playing SimCity, building a huge city, and then burning only to be able to reload a saved game later. Burning it really doesn't even disturb you a bit because you can always just get it right back the way it was.\n \n Being that there was no choice at first then that proves that if there was only a heaven that the system would be just fine.

   "So saying to, particularly a child, worship god or go to hell, is not brainwashing. If you believe you country is the best in the world is either ignorance or patriotism, thats not brainwashing.\n\n \n Not in my opinion. It is no different than teaching a child they have to do well in school or be a failure. It is the parent trying to teach the child a lesson they believe will be valuable to them in the future. It is necessary in my opinion to have such forms of teaching be available regardless as to whether this is brainwashing or not. Also teaching your child that you live in the best country in the world is an opinion just as is the opinion whether God exists or not. As long as your child is subjected to you as their primary teacher and you teach them your opinion I guess you could claim that it is a form of brainwashing.\n \n [QUOTE]Take for example suicide bombers, they believe they will go to heaven if they carry out there mission, thats also brainwashing, would a patriot do something like that? I dont think so. [/UOTE]\n \n I still think this is showing that humans are social and learn from what others like them do. May it be family or countrymen or those of similar race, creed, or origin, I think humans will just learn from what they see and be strongly influenced by it. It is not common that you see Americans going on suicide runs yet you see it a lot around Israel. It is the type of people who live there and the message they pass on as an entire group. It is not just an isolated case of brainwashing, it is a part of their culture I guess you could say.\n \n \nIts interesting to note my earlier post, in places where theres no or little religious education, theres a lower number of religious people.\n\n \n But this also deals with the fact that people are social and learn from those around them. If there are no religious centers then people have no place to go to socially learn to be religious therefore there are less religious people. Culture itself is a form of brainwashing you to believe that there are a certain set of things that you have to do to fit in. You learn what these things are socially, not by being set down and forced to learn these things. It is socially and culturally learned.",

Since God is only perfect if his plans are unfolding exactly as his all powerful intentions meant for them to then he is the cause of basically everything even if it is indirectly. He knew that there would be people who would suffer on Earth and that there would be those who would not listen to him and he would therefore have to send to hell. He knew who these people would be and he knew what it would mean to send them to hell. Therefore God must have wanted there to be a hell, wanted to people to go to hell, and that in itself shows that he is not all that well suited to be considered the God some Christians believe he is. Many Christians will say that he does not want anyone to go to hell but based on my analysis I would have to say that is incorrect.

Regardless if it is a difficult or easy choice. \n \n As for the nature of God, I cannot actually answer all of the why questions you ask. Ask Him. I am a finite being with limited education and understanding. Why would you expect me to answer everything. I was hoping we could focus on the one issue. I gave you an overview of christian theology.

If God came to everyone on this planet right now and gave them their options I don't think there would be one non-Christian left on the planet. There just is no real opportunity to make a choice when it comes to praising God or not considering that if you don't you will go to hell. That is all I stated. I never said anything about people being able to do whatever they want without any consquences. Find where I said this. You say you mean no disrespect but then you follow it up with this type of statement.\n \n \nYou won't accept my concept of God. Neither will I accept the idea that God does not exist. What did you hope to gain out of this if we are only going to go back and forth and say the other is wrong. How is that helpful. Provide some information as to why your definition is better. You argue the nature of God well. I don't dispute that. I have given reason as to why he is worthy of worship. He is the definer of all things. You say no he is not and then blame me for not proving that he is. \n\n \n How is it helpful? I am simply debating a brand new idea of mine. I started the day debating how God ruled like a communist. I end the day realizing that because God is all knowing, all powerful, and perfect, that everything that happens is actually linked directly to his own will. This is a concept I had dismissed long ago. Going back and forth allowed me to see a whole lot of new issues today and toy with a lot of different ideas. I don't go into a debate thinking that I am correct generally. I just state my views and hope to become better educated on a subject and that is exactly what happened today for me. So what you see as back and forth was really a list of very interesting and influential ideas to me.\n \n \nI CANNOT PROVE IT. to ask for this is useless. I stopped because we are getting nowhere. I know where you stand. Your current responses show that you have not changed your stance. \n\n \n I'm not sure what you are responding to here. I can't find the word prove in the post you are responding to.\n \n \nAs for spin, I could say the same about you. It is a non argument. I have provided a definition. Choice is choice. Regardless if it is a difficult or easy choice. \n\n \n I didn't call that spin. What I was refering to was the fact that you said Saddam didn't give people a choice. There was a choice to optionally write a name in if they wanted to so there was a choice. Of course there was a good chance that you would die trying this. So in your own opinion this should still be viewed as a choice and not anyone forcing a choice on you. This is not the way I see it though. I believe there was a choice but the choice was forced on the people. I can't even gather how you couldn't see it that way.\n \n \nAs for the nature of God, I cannot actually answer all of the why questions you ask. Ask Him. I am a finite being with limited education and understanding. Why would you expect me to answer everything. I was hoping we could focus on the one issue. I gave you an overview of christian theology. You then argued the points of it. Not a fair thing to do since the question at hand is why. I have answered why. \n\n \n Then I'll only ask you if it makes sense. So does it make sense that the loving and perfect God didn't allow people into heaven before the death of Jesus? If not then do you see this as a failure on any level considering those poor souls in hell right now who would have been in heaven under todays 'rules'?\n \n \nIf you truly are looking for good answers then I will continue. It did not seem like it because of the kinds of responses you were making. You attacked with statements like \"and you know it\" and the like. Those are non arguments and frutiless. \n\n \n I does upset me that I believe you know one thing but are debating another just to carry your debate. I think you do realize that we have a decision that is forced on us and that it really is unfair of God to give us the option of worship or hell.\n \n \nI have not attacked you. I have tried to answer the questions and you accuse me of evading them. I am not God and am doing the best I can. You asking me Why God did something. That is like me asking you why Joseph McMillian in Rhode Island did something. I can only tell you what the bible tells me. And we both know what you think of the bible. So............what am I left with?\n\n \n Logic is what we are all left with. Logic is what allowed me to come to the conclusion that God probably does display a weakness or lazy side to him based on what we know about him. Everything he does has a reason and the reasoning is perfect. A perfect reason for him to create us and have a heaven and hell is to get something that he needs done for him. That would explain why he will recreate a second earth after his second coming where only the good will live. It would explain the reason that we are all here today. We are here to do his work for him. Perhaps he really isn't all powerful and that would explain a whole lot about him including the mistakes he has made and the flaws that appear when you consider that he should be perfect and everything should be going as planned yet there is a hell and not everyone of his creations worships him the way it should have been meant to be. Maybe God is a much more like us than we think he is, maybe a scientist of the stars. This is at least what I'm starting to believe we may be dealing with here. It just seems to add up a lot more than the whole all powerful, all knowing, perfect God idea does.\n \n \nNo one's soul was collected in hell till Jesus died. The new testament refers to them as asleep. I am not sure what that means and I don't thinbk the bible speaks to it.\n\n \n I was probably misinformed on this subject. I was told that they had all gone to hell including Jesus until heaven was finally opened to them all. I was also told no sins were taken away from anyone but the living meaning they would all have to go to hell anyways.\n \n \nPlease, do not accuse me of intentionally spinning anything. I do not do that. I hate that in fact. I will always answer to the best of my ability. If it seems like spin ask me to clarify. Ask a question or two but don't slam me and don't spam me with questions. I cannot keep up.\n\n \n I haven't been intentionally spamming questions here. I have just had so many ideas I had to get them posted before forgetting what they were.",

   "If I were to ever relate God to time I would get called on it right away so I guess I'll have to do the same to you. What make you think that God is at all related to time in any way? He is above time and is not constrained by it. So he probably hasn't been doing anything for any amount of time. Don't try to use that explaination to give a likely solution to why he created humans.\n \n \n \n Without going too deep into this I gather that what your basically saying is that he has done all this for his own amusement? Does this make God worthy of our worship?\n \n \n \n ***************************************************\n If you only answer a couple questions in your reply please make it these.\n \n What is this about prototypes? Are you suggesting God the perfect needs prototypes? Are you also suggesting the things he created were unlike what he intended them to be?\n \n Let me make you aware that he knew what was going to happen long before making the first humans otherwise he wouldn't be all knowing. He created them exactly as he wanted to create them otherwise he would be all powerful. He also got exactly what he intended to get out of them otherwise he wouldn't be perfect. Try to debunk this statement.\n ***************************************************\n\n \n Time go fig. \n \n His own asmusement yeah. You got a problem with that? \n \n He is worthy cuz he said so. Look people give the state more authority than God. He ask the same thing the military does. This is one reason why my religion does not join the military.\n \n \n Prototypes whats wrong with that? Adam was the first generation a one off. Eve was extracted from him and probally was a female \"clone\" a test mule. They broke. Adam said it was Gods fault they broke he made the woman. God said \"You're kidding right? I told you if you ate that you would break. Warranty void. Next customer.\"\n \n How would God know what would happen? It was not his choice. If there is a fork in the road and God says pick a one then he is saying \"I don't know what is going to happen next you decide\" that is the concept of choice. If you don't beleave in choice fine. Then you should be an atheist. My religion was founded by idiology from a former presbytarian. They don't believe in choice. We logiced out long ago if there is no choice then God lied.\n \n (He also got exactly what he intended to get out of them otherwise he wouldn't be perfect. )\n \n He also created entropy and \"evil\" what's your point.

   "This is turning into a very hectic debate, 46 posts in such a short time.\n \n I still think theres a certain amount of brainwashing involved, not only in christianity but other religions too.\n \n XQthaipoes, your a jehovas witness, what do you worship to, if anything? Why are you a jehovas witness, were you converted or brought up being one?\n \n In eastern europe, particularly the ex soviets states, church attendences are far lower than in western europe or other religios countries. People there are not so religious.\n \n During communist times they did not have religious education and church/religios gatherings were frowned on by the communists. \n \n Which is probably why people are not so religious, which in a way, although not conclusive, shows that preaching to children, brainwashes them to believe.\n\n \n Plotter you are actually a bit off. Jehovah's Witnesses were all sent to labor camps in Siberia in a personal order from Stalin. Growth in the former Soviet Union is among greatest in the world, and attendance among the best.\n \n We worship Jehovah the Jew's God.\n \n My parents are Jehovah's Witnesses. I decided to become one as a teenager. My stepbrother thought he wanted to be one, but later left, then he decided to give it a try again, and was murdered in a spat with his gangland friends the day his decided to call it quits like some bad movie clich\u00e9. My sister is undecided and just hanging around.\n \n This is to AMD the things you are saying we have been saying as a religion for a long time. Even the sleep in death part. The mainstream Christian doctrine that's not in pop culture Christianity (in America we have this new MTV teeny bop Christianity that preys on kids in rural towns and the suburbs that is like day care for teens with raging hormones) doesn't make sense. Most Christian religions realized it is a logical fallacy and invent ways around it. Catholics hundreds of years ago for example sold indulgences, created purgatory, and put in confession booths to cope. \n \n We take the obvious path and just tell it like it is. People outside the bible made up most of \"Christian\" doctrine. If you read that lil black book you realized that God runs a simple holy monarchy. The reason that the bible is hard to relate to now is we don't live like that anymore, but for thousands of years God's system mirrored human government (there goes the made in his image thing). Even pagans isolated from the Middle East used this form of rule. The JW doctrine due to its origins is hard to crack unless you try to undermine \"credibility\". If you don't have an issue with credibility then there is no hell, and God is not Jesus so \"Christianity\" works. All the Jewish metaphors make sense.",

   "thank you XQ\n \n but the thing is, the christian church's biggest boast is that it is the 'only true religion' serving the 'only true God'. when the Bible is suddenly exposed as not true, then it reduces christianity to the same level as any other \"Holy Book\" based religion (Islam, hinduism, Greek/Norse, etc). why should anyone rightly boast that their myth is better than the other guy's myth? if its all just myth, then none is real. why should we believe that God exists after continually demonstrating that Shiva, Lakshmi, Buddha, Zeus and Osirus are all false gods? what makes the Biblical God any more real, since He too is based on a book full of myths?\n\n \n Their biggest boast is they are the largest religion on earth IMO. People take their religion so seriously because they are shallow. I know it may seem like an oxymoron that people that are \"deep\" in their respective faiths are shallow, but it is meta-physical materialism coined spirituality (a lie for humans can't be spiritual).\n \n Just because it is a myth does not mean there is anything wrong with it. For some reason modern humans see myths as bad evil primitive things; crutches for those inferior intellect and literacy. What is wrong with God being a myth? That is the whole concept of faith. I am going to buy a myth to cope with my immediate problems then hope it pays off my future problems. It is the same thing as trying to find a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. Don't let anyone with faith lie to you and say that is based on reality, for if it was then there would be no need for faith. \n \n Objectively God is not \"more\" real than any other mythological god. This is shown when he butts heads with \"mythological\" gods in the bible. A god being real is just part of a religion. Look at Wiccans or better Hindus they are still around and you claim their gods are myths. Look at East Asia they are not concerned about gods as much as if grandma's or grandpa's spirit will come back and ruin their crops or pox their business. \n \n It all boils down to people manufacture their own alternate reality like a mulberry harbor to shelter their belief. If you build these atolls of \"faith\" strong enough you believe you'll be rewarded. I while I still have my faith I have opened my eyes. God is so big he barely notices us as individuals therefore he seems shallow and trivial when he smites us in mass. In reality we are his pets. He will probably ignore us until we bite one of the kids then he will take us off to get euthanized. We won't even see it coming the final offense won't even make our paltry local news.",

   "fair enough...\n \n however, is there any reason for you why you would still think God exists at all? it doesnt have to be a scientific reason, it could be that 'man is so awesomely made' or 'evolution doesnt make sense' or maybe personal miracles in your own life. what Im trying to say is, after your belief in the bible fell off, what did you use to justify the existence of God?\n \n I think Im in the position you already passed: losing faith in the Bible itself. the problem is that the bible is the sole source of the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, so christianity itself, as far as I see, is foundationless without the bible. how do you still justify christianity without a bible?\n\n \n I no longer consider myself a Christian. I do not believe in Jesus Christ, nor do I believe the Bible to be anything more than stories of those trying (maybe unsuccessfully) to explain their faith and relationship with God. Perhaps in the overzealousness to share this \"amazing\" relationship, they forgot that each person relationship with God is individual and cannot be defined by another persons relationship.\n \n One of the fundamental problems with Christianity is that it seems to have created an unecessary end: Hell. I prefer to believe that when I die, I have remained faithful to God that I will become transcedent and join him in heaven, if not, I will die and thats the end of that. There is no punishment other than the self-concieved one. Perhaps early Christians thought that to die without transcedence was so horrible they had to create a name for it and over the years it has evolved to become this \"supreme punishment\".\n \n I think that rather than losing faith in the bible, I have come to a realization of what it really is. Peoples attempts to explain their individual relationships with God. Because the bible has so many authors, of course their are going to be contradictions, because not everyones relationship is the same. Simply compare my relationship with XQsThaiPoes.

The fact that God already knows the outcome, and we don't, does not reduce the importance of us making that choice. \n The journey is just as important as the destination.\n \n Sandy emoticon_xangel\n\n \n You understand that makes God blood guilty. If he already knows the out come then he deliberately ruined everything. Unlike a human even if you knew everything you won't have the power to change anything, but God is the one making every thing. So basically he made the world how he wanted it. If he knew how it was going to turn out, and made it anyway it is his fault. Just like a Ford with an exploding gas tank. Why is this so hard to see?

We are nothing more than toys, objects for him to control. And you wonder why I've declared war against God.\n 4) God sent Jesus to restore our choice? Yeah, okay, if that's the case, then why isn't there more proof? None of us know if he died on the cross and was ressurected or not: we are being asked to follow with viels over our eyes, blind and drugged by promises of power. \n 5) Attack my reasoning all you want, but if you're going to do it, at least have the decency to understand what I'm saying and not twist it so that you can apply your need to be persecuted to be at your spiritual best.

   "Somehow, whenever I post on threads on message boards, mine always ends up being the last. Be that because everyone is tired of the fight or because I've said something of such powerful finality there's nothing else to say, I don't know. But anyway. I've found that religion and spirituality are two different things. The former steals answers from those who have come before, calls it their own, and refuses to accept any other possibility, much like the Empire of Star Wars mythology. The other yearns for answers and seeks them out, realizing that while no apparent answer may ever be discovered, and more likely that there is NO answer, the joy is in the journey, not the destination, and seeks to allow all viewpoints to be valid. Again, using the Star Wars mythology, this is like the Republic before its infestation with bitter and whiny Senators. We, that is, the agnostics and seekers of truth, should be careful not to become like the Republic before its fall.\n \n It can be said that God, or shall we say more preferrably, a cosmic creator, does not exist. And we all KNOW it doesn't; and yet simultaneously it is important for some of us to fill the void of doubt and fear that is the base of our weakness with false answers and meaningless hope. I respect humanity's right to do that, but I cannot allow the world to be ignorant. \"Belief is dangerous . . . believe in NOTHING.\" Peace.",
