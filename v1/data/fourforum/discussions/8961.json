I'm just curious to see if those people still have that view after the leaked document admits that it has actually increased global terrorism...\n \n edit: Irag war obviously, sorry...\n\n \n Your curiosity will be rewarded by posts from those individuals containing rationalizations for blind patriotism. My definition of that term being citizens who without question support current administration's foreign policy. IMO:\n \n 1. Iraq was invaded and occupied based on erroneous or disregarded intelligence. Some posters still believe there are WMDs in Iraq that could harm the US, regardless of official, contrary government statements.\n \n 2. Refocus from WMDs to ridding Iraq of a tyrant leader. Still a popular theme for those who believe democracy suitable for all countries regardless of societal customs and general history. \n \n 3. Refocus to spreading democracy into Iraq. A lot of equal rights blather regarding a country with destroyed infrastructure and a population majority that wishes the US out of Iraq and approves of killing US troops and citizens in their country. \n \n 4. The recently released papers only verify what anyone with a shred of common sense knows; of course US actions in Iraq greatly increased resentment of US policy by ME populations excepting Israel and those extremists who fight oppression for those populations.",

   "Here's what I find amazing. First, this stuff gets leaked of this report that says our presence in Iraq has led to more terrorists. So Bush's response is to be angry about it and say that the American people don't have the context of the whole report and says that because of this he is deciding to release the document so everyone can see the whole context. He then proceeds to relase only four pages of a 30 page document. The ironic thing is that it was released with the purpose of squashing the idea of the leak and what those 4 pages say is that our presence in Iraq has led to more terrorists.",

Or a pre-election hole card with the usual protect the US rationalization?",
