   "People seem to be having trouble with the idea that even with construction leveling out, we have not seen the bottom of the housing slump by a long shot. We have not even seen the beginning. The 18% decrease in the market since last year was just the lead up to the correction, not the correction itself. There are roughly 640,000 americans who will not be able to afford their loan payments when those loans reset. That is the needle that is actually going to ##### the bubble. \n \n Studying equity bubbles is interesting because wether you are talking tulip bulbs, biotech stocks, farmland, or dot com stocks, the bubbles all follow a similar pattern. The housing bubble is doing the same.",

Over the course of the next 2 years those loans will be resetting and forclosure is sure to follow. Make sure you don't buy in the rash of fire sales that are sure to be prominent as people try to sell the home before it ends up being foreclosed on. Wait for forclosures to increase 60-80%, then you can start shopping :) \n \n If Bushs budget passes, it will be an interesting \"growth\" year. Last year if you subtracted deficit spending with a reasonable multiplier, you quickly saw that our 3.3% GDP growth was based entirely on that deficit spending. Obviously in order to follow that up, you need even MORE deficit spending. Given the rate of M4 growth and the already sour taste that foreign investors seem to have for our dollars, the dollar will likely take a beating this year which will also have an impact on domestic bubble economies.",

That way the economy tanks a little...accountants get more jobs and the housing market still sinks as planned. I'd be rolling in it then ;) We do have some new GAAP standard coming out regarding hedging, fair valuing, and other tools of that nature...that might bring out some interesting numbers.",
