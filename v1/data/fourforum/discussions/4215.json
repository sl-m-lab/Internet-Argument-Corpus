Yea.

They make their successs seem more realistic than they are due to their very selective measures. According to my Historical foundations of Edu. professor, who is the administrator of one of the schools, they can do whatever they want, and it's not actually good, in addition to the reasons mentioned above. The majority of private schools he oversees and near the Burlington region have math scores lower than those of the public schools (science as well), and there are no other schools anywhere close enough for parents to drop off children.\n \n There is also no transportation provided by this institutions as of yet, and they aren't planning on it, because it costs too much and no one else has anywhere else to go.\n \n THere are also many failures, which is silly in an important institution like education.

   "First, how teaching intelligent design violates the constitution is beyond me.\n\n Simply because it is religiously motivated. There is no science involved. IDists don't form hypotheses based on empirical data. Therefore they don't make predictions from the hypotheses that are then tested by experimentation. IDists meet a problem and declare that they don't understand how it could have come about so it must be designed by some unknown supernaturatural being who did something somewhere sometime in the past. They just pretend that it doesn't matter who the designer is but they all claim their own god.\n \nSecond, The Big Bang Theory can't be proved, but shows just he opposite if you study how the galaxies are drifting and so forth.....so that part of science, ie. evolution is a myth for me.\n\n Well, no scientific theory is \"proved.\" They are always tentative explanations for observations that have been tested. A scientific theory is always open to the consideration of new evidence and new hypotheses that can make predictions that can be tested. That's how theories are updated. By the way, the big bang isn't part of the theory of evolution. You are confused. Isn't it sad that you oppose something and you don't even have the slightest idea of what you oppose? The big bang is the name for a theory about how the universe grew. That science is called cosmology. If you go to NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) site and click on \"Universe\" you will find an introduction to cosmology. Actually you are incorrect. If you were to actually study the movement of the galaxies you would find that the universe is expanding. It is logical that at some time in the past the universe was smaller. This idea followed to the conclusion leads to the idea of an expansion of the universe from a single source.\n \nThird I understand how if they were saying it IS creation or it IS the Big Bang, since neither can be proven, that would be wrong. However, offering students an alternative to the bacteria<fish<alligators<Apes<human thing or however you believe we \"evolved\", is not that bad.\n\n Proof is not a matter of science. Science is and explanation of the evidence. Creationism is faith based on not evidence. In science class we teach current scientific theories. That's why we don't teach that the earth is flat or that the earth is the center of the universe, even though there are some who still believe that and even though the church burned people at the stake for disagreeing with that interpretation of the Bible. Science class is not the place to offer faith based mythology as an alternative. Perhaps an optional course on mythology or a course in comparative religion would do. Perhaps you should teach your religion in your own home and in your own church and not try impose it on everyone else in state supported schools.\n \nNow if they started saying Jesus Christ died for your sins, not that it would offend me, but to be fair as to not having the Mohammed, and Budah's path to enlightenment, and confucious, and so on......\n\n That method was rejected by the courts. The purpose of the Establishment Clause is to prevent the government from endorsing or supporting religion. ID Creationism is an attempt avoid the 1st Amendment by claiming an unknown designer and trying to make it sound scientific. But the fact is, it isn't science.\n \nAnyways, I don't see the problem.....people just need to get their panties our out of a knot.\n\n So if I object to your religion being forced on my children in state supported schools, I have my panties in a knot?

Any theory that didn't stand the test has been discarded. There may be more that are discarded, but there is a present body of scientific knowledge that includes the theory of evolution. This body of knowledge is the best that we have at the moment. There are some theories that are on more solid ground than others.\n \n I'd say the LambaCDM cosmological model, for example, will somehow fail, because it's conceptually shaky.\n The theory of evolution (as an umbrella to all it's minor theories) is so solid by now, based on observation of evidence, that it is called 'scietific fact.'\n \n It's not like everyone is 100.00% sure that all of it's correct.\n But the very concept of species evolving over time is pretty close.\n That's what they mean when they say \"evolution is a fact.\"\n It's so well-supported by evidence, and all attempts to debunk it so far have failed, that it's accepted as fact.\n \n \n \nYou talk about having an open mind. Why should I have to accept that because you say so?\n\n No one said accept it because I said so.\n You should read and learn and then maybe you'll accept it.\n But how can you learn about it if no one teaches you in school?\n I guess you could read the journals, but you probably couldn't follow them.\n So to give people a basis of understanding while they are still young, kids are taught what the results of science are up to the present.\n That's why evolution should be taught.\n \n Just because someone rejects an idea because they see the flaws doesn't mean they are close minded.\n \n \nAll things in life don't revolve around some scientific theory.

   "When someone is forced to attend school for 7 hours a day and hear anti-religious theories, as opposed to practicing religion for said time, then it violates the free exercise of religion.\n\n Do you also consider the theories of physics to be anti-religious? How about chemistry? Geology? Anyway, you lose in court. The Supreme Court has found that creationism isn't science and has no place in a science class while at the same time deciding that evolutionary theory is science. It is not anti-religious. In fact, it is you who is anti-science because you are unable to reconcile your mythology based faith with the observations of science.\n \n It also seems that you feel that American History, English, Government and so on are anti-religious. Other classes take up most of the day of a student. Biology is usually only one class taken for a single year. You seem to be overstating the case just a bit. Of course if you prefer, you can put your children into a religious school where they will spend all day practicing religion. The Taliban did that. Why shouldn't you?\n \n But all that aside, the requirement of the state that children be educated according to guidlines issued by the state does not interfere with the practice of religion. In fact, special arrangements have been made by schools to accomodate special religious needs in the past. Your problem is that your need not to be taught science isn't a religious right.\n \nFreedom of religion and a secular state can only coexist if the secular state is a minimal state.\n\n Great. So your answer is to teach your religion along side of science. That sure makes for a minimal state. They we'll have to teach my religion too, don't you think?\n \nWhen the State promotes certain ideas at the expense of others (in this case, evolution at the expense of creation) it makes the promoted ideas look bad.\n\n No it doesn't. It makes the mythology of creation look like mythology perhaps.\n \nEvolution is a strong theory with strong evidence - therefore, it can compete in the free market of ideas without state support.\n\n It has. That is why evolution is taught as a part of a good biology course. That is why creationism is not. Creationism was falsified more that 150 years ago.",

   "OK, I'm taking biology this year and apparently our biology teacher has gotten complaints in the past for teaching about evolution, here's what she has explained. There's something called the scientific method that some of you seem to not know about. First someone must make an observation of something. Then they make a hypothesis about what that observation means. Then they do a lot of experimentation and if it supports their hypothesis, they publish their findings. It is then reviewed by other scientists all over the world who can test and verify the experiments (which have to be repeatable) in their labs. Then and only then can it be called a theory. After that if there is one small piece of evidence contradicting the theory, it must be revised or scraped all together. Another thing she stated was that in physics and other sciences such as that laws are the equivelant of theories. So the argument about how evolution is only a theory, and not a law, is utter bull. There is nothing higher up than a theory. There is not any more proof for gravity than there is for evolution. It has and can be tested in a lab with the right equipment, that's why it's taught in classrooms. To dzeron would you agree with me that I shouldn't have to learn history, because I believe my god created us all a couple of minutes ago and implanted our memories and all books, etc. on this earth and that none of this so-called \"history\" ever really happened? When I see a Christian or other believer propose an experiment to validate the creation myth, I will pay more attention to it as science, but until then it's just that, a myth.",

Until we know what cause the expansion of all the stars viewable to us, we know that as time goes backwards we are had to have been closer together that we are today. Therefore, at one point we might have been all in one spot. Also, the planets have to be moving away at a particular speed or gravity would be pulling us closer and we would collide with othe planets. That also proves that the universe can't be static or gravity would have that effect. \n \n You don't have to believe this, but at least think about it for a minute.

As well, they still will always cherry pick, as they always have, because they fear no legislation and oversight. They are little self-contained worlds of whatever some administrator wants.\n \n Ahh yes. This must be why so many people were \"educucated\" prior to public education, which is why when private schools reigned, there were always few educated, expensive, and...cherry picked, like they are today. Public education is the only realistic way to get mass education to the masses. That's why it was adopted, and the improvements since the days of priv-education are well documented and beneficial. It's only recent problems which are causing failures\n \n 1. Too powerful teacher's unions and the faulty tenure system\n 2. Misuse of government funds by administrators who build football fields instead of books. All of which can be fixed without trashing the system, going fanatic, using tons of time and money to build a whole new network of schools.\n \n Not to mention all the people who will be out of work if you take all the public schools and shut them down. These teachers won't be jumping into private schools ya know, because people with degree's and higher classifications require more pay.\n \n Private schools can hire anyone they want, regardless if they have teaching degree's or pass state tests for teaching.\n \n Teachers in public schools go through a mandatory 1 year mentoring period, are going to need a masters degree soon, and go through a lot of pre-teacher training. I do, but I was stunned to find out from my Education professor that this doesn't go on at many of his private insitutions he supervises. \n \n Gee--whatta suprise. No authority overhead = that.\n \n \n \n There is no arbitrary standard of failure or success. It all depends upon individual goals.

   "Members of councils of respective agencies: Anthropology, Physics, Chem. Whatever experts dictate what gets learned as well as any lame parent/administrator of a school. They know better than the uninformed voting masses.\n \n Good or Bad are quasi-subjective terms. All that matters is the learning material. The state ought to allow the academics to make the curriculum and the government sets this standard.\n\n \n Dictatorship of the experts? The experts, being an unaffected party, cannot make decisions for other individuals. Decisions for people's lives should be left to those who are affected. Why? Because they have an incentive to make the decision that is best for themselves.\n \n Experts aren't gods. Your quest for a society of perfect rulers is surprisingly parallel to the ideals of the religious right.\n \n \n \n\n This is a rebuttle how? You are saying that because public schools use a rationalist, pro-true knowledge system, Private schools cannot?\n \n That's silly. Very, very silly. It's basically saying: They are doing science! So we cannot do it if we wanna compete!\n \n lol. You're funny.\n \n\n \n It's because the government makes rationalist education free. There is no incentive for people to pay a private school to teach the same things they would learn for free in a public school. If the public schools taught religious garbage, you would see all the religious private schools go out of business and rationalist ones will appear. Basic market economics.\n \n \n\n I disagree. Children are less competent than adults most of the time. They aren't even fully formed when it comes to their brains and thought faculties. They are also prone to ill-thought decisions. The child shouldn't say jack.\n \n No one ought to choose. They should have public education with a curriculum directed by non-government agencies of knowledge and supervised/enforced by the State. \n \n\n \n Incompetence is a subjective term. You can't disparage personal autonomy to people because they are \"incompetent.\" This is because incompetence cannot be defined in objective terms.\n \n There are some adults who are less competent than children, you know.\n \n \n\n Already showed this from at least a dozen sources, including 3 from the government. Anyway. none of you believe in \"proving\" anything anyway. Remember, you don't believe in the Burden of Proof fallacy being on the asserter, but the questioner. I believe the opposite, but in light of this divine irony, I will let you hunt stuff down.\n\n \n You have asserted that the private schools have no room. The burden of proof is on you.\n \n \n \n\n Irrelevant. Whether it's bad or not--it's a widespread practice and it's not stopping anytime soon. It happens, it happened in the past, and it will happen in the future. It ought not to happen, but...it does. That's the nature of selective \"cherrypicking\" private education.\n\n \n The private schools who don't do this will have a significant market advantage over the cherrypicking ones. Think about it. More customers equals more profit.\n \n \n\n The vast majority of them provide adequate transportation for children. Private schools have no responsibility to do this. Zero. You pay, you drive, no matter where it is, how far.\n\n \n Private schools have busses. I drove past one just today, and there were busses at it.\n \n \n\n The problem is, due to the other problems, there will never bee mass private schools, because they will take too long to build, and it will be expensive to build them all. As well, they still will always cherry pick, as they always have, because they fear no legislation and oversight. They are little self-contained worlds of whatever some administrator wants.\n \n Ahh yes. This must be why so many people were \"educucated\" prior to public education, which is why when private schools reigned, there were always few educated, expensive, and...cherry picked, like they are today. Public education is the only realistic way to get mass education to the masses. That's why it was adopted, and the improvements since the days of priv-education are well documented and beneficial. It's only recent problems which are causing failures\n \n 1. Too powerful teacher's unions and the faulty tenure system\n 2. Misuse of government funds by administrators who build football fields instead of books. All of which can be fixed without trashing the system, going fanatic, using tons of time and money to build a whole new network of schools.\n \n Not to mention all the people who will be out of work if you take all the public schools and shut them down. These teachers won't be jumping into private schools ya know, because people with degree's and higher classifications require more pay.\n \n Private schools can hire anyone they want, regardless if they have teaching degree's or pass state tests for teaching.\n \n Teachers in public schools go through a mandatory 1 year mentoring period, are going to need a masters degree soon, and go through a lot of pre-teacher training. I do, but I was stunned to find out from my Education professor that this doesn't go on at many of his private insitutions he supervises. \n \n Gee--whatta suprise. No authority overhead = that.\n \n \n\n \n I said this already. The government should ensure that private schools are not isolated worlds ruled by administrators. Children cannot be held hostage by any business, public or private.\n \n Also, I don't think existing public schools should be shut down. They should be turned into private schools.\n \n And finally, the public schools are failing because of the administrators who misuse funds that you mentioned. This is a classic example of the expert dictators making mistakes with people's lives, having no incentive to make the right decision.\n \n \n\n This is one way in which Socialists are flawed. People are't equal. Some people are obviously superior to others, and to thse people, one should defer judgement. Intelligence and achievement ability is perhaps the best indicator of this.\n \n Intelligence is what separates the good from the joe schmoe's of west virginia. Everyone deserves equal treatment in terms of basic needs and rights, but not everyone is equal.\n \n\n \n People aren't equal in terms of individual attributes, such as intelligence or strength. But we can't arbitrarily set values for different attributes and determine some individuals superior and others inferior. Such standards are inevitably determined by an aristocratic ruling class. There is no meritocracy.\n \n We are all individuals. We all have the right to direct our own lives and own what we make. We are different, but equal.\n \n \n\n I disagree. With the stupidity of the masses, the truth DOES need state support. That's the problem. That's why XXXXXX are beginning to infest the public science curriculum. THey are comming from \"private\" homes and \"private\" sources.\n \n\n \n \"The truth needs state support.\" That is the premise behind theocracy. God forbid that the stupid masses start questioning the unquestionable truth!\n \n Words, not swords, are the way to convince people of the truth. If evolution is true, then it should win out in the free market of ideas. Evolution was able to gain support even when creationism was being taught in public schools. The strength of the theory is immense. And I say it is stupid to rig the contest in favor of the competitor that is bound to win anyway.\n \n \n \n\n Yea, just like the schools that teach that evolution is false, creationism is good, and God created the earth in 6 days. They aren't out of business. In fact, parents swarm to them.\n\n \n I think that when the public schools are turned to private business, they should be put in the hands of those who will continue to teach the old curriculum. That way, rationalist schools will be present in high numbers AND have a natural market advantage over the irrational schools. Evolution theory will not suddenly collapse when the state withdraws its support (that is, unless it's a bad theory, which it isn't.)",

   "Dictatorship of the experts? The experts, being an unaffected party, cannot make decisions for other individuals. Decisions for people's lives should be left to those who are affected. Why? Because they have an incentive to make the decision that is best for themselves.\n\n \n The limits to their freedoms are minimal. And no one said there's a dictatorship of the experts. Where do you get this? \n \n \n\n Experts aren't gods. Your quest for a society of perfect rulers is surprisingly parallel to the ideals of the religious right.\n\n \n Except the religous right trumpets a 2000 year old tom clancy novel as fact and success quite well in the private sectr, and always will; science, on the other hand, is an objective endeavour, and with peer review, it's not dogmatic. They should decide what gets taught. That's hardly dogmatic.\n \n No one said experts are Gods, but experts are the most qualifed to create the curriculae, as long as the stuff presented is peer-reviewed.\n \n There is no society of \"perfect\" rulers. Who said the society is run by perfect elected officals? No one said that. It's a complete strawman. We are talking about education, who sets the curriculum. It's not the government, it's not the parents. It should merely be the responsibility of the government to make sure the mainstream experts are being credited and heeded.\n \n It's perfectly legal for the government to be involved in education, as well, since education is left up to the states, but with some supervision powers by the Federal Government. Ever wonder why we don't have a democracy? The people were too stupid to run the government. The people aren't ment to have mass-power or decision making capabilities. They are little children wielding votes and running around with scissors point up.\n \n \n \n \n \n\n It's because the government makes rationalist education free.\n\n \n There is no such thing as a free lunch in economics. There is always a mariginal cost when striving for utility. 70% of our property taxes go to paying for the \"free\" education. It's not free at all. We pay for it, but it's regulated and they give a responsible curriculum, which the \"payed\" private schools, many-a-time (not all of them, however) do not.\n \n \n\n There is no incentive for people to pay a private school to teach the same things they would learn for free in a public school.\n\n \n Better qualied, smaller class sizes, personal relations to parents as well as a rational curriculum could easily be offered. They can easily offer the same curriculum do to the other \"hypothetical\" benefits.\n \n \n\n If the public schools taught religious garbage, you would see all the religious private schools go out of business and rationalist ones will appear. Basic market economics.\n\n \n Public schools don't teach religious garbage (not all anyway) because it's illegal. It's not illegal to teach it in privaet schools. Public schools, hopefully, will never cater to such a low denominator as religious people occupy.\n \n As it stands, it doesn't matter IF they would, because they most likely won't, while P-schools can get away with blatently hacked curriculum nonsense. That's exactly what will happen if they all go private, because a near-majority loves that **** in their education. They WANT public schools to do it too, but they can't win there.\n \n \n \n\n Incompetence is a subjective term. You can't disparage personal autonomy to people because they are \"incompetent.\" This is because incompetence cannot be defined in objective terms.\n\n \n Incompetence can be defined in objective terms. Not-competent = unable to make good rational decisions; rational being defined as not-contrary to reason and logic. People who are incompetent are those who believe in and try to manipulate, enforce the metaphysic, the non-scientific.\n \n People who believe in Ghosts, Goblins, God, and Gremlins, and YEC are non-rationalist incompetents. \n \n People who cannot separate reality from fantasy fall in this line of incompetence as well.\n \n \n\n There are some adults who are less competent than children, you know.\n \n\n \n Yes. Some are, but most aren't. Most children are less developed mentally that most adults. They aren't even considered under full rights partially because of their limited mental autonomy and critical thinking skills.\n \n There are always some exceptions, however.\n \n \n\n You have asserted that the private schools have no room. The burden of proof is on you.\n\n \n I know. I ought to provide proof, shoudn't I? Just like others who asserted stuff and other's questioned, yet the questioner was told it was childish to ask the person asserting an opinion to provide evidence.\n \n \" I think's\" don't need proof. Only \"the questioner\" need provide sources if he wants to refute something.\n \n Stupid isn't it? I don't agree, but I will play along because the irony is funny.\n \n I already showed sources for this anyway from non-partisan organizations.\n \n \n \n \n The private schools who don't do this will have a significant market advantage over the cherrypicking ones. Think about it. More customers equals more profit.\n \n \n \n\n Private schools have busses. I drove past one just today, and there were busses at it.\n\n \n Some do. I didn't say all. Many do not, especially when the private school is out of your county/district that you \"choose\" to go to because it as the curriculum you desire. This is also a problem if your school fails.\n \n \n \n\n I said this already. The government should ensure that private schools are not isolated worlds ruled by administrators. Children cannot be held hostage by any business, public or private.\n\n \n This should be the case, but there are no laws requiring private institutions to do anything or have any responsibility to authority. In a private school, other than the parent, the Admins and boards are God.\n \n \n\n Also, I don't think existing public schools should be shut down. They should be turned into private schools.\n\n \n Ahh. They could do that.\n \n \n\n And finally, the public schools are failing because of the administrators who misuse funds that you mentioned. This is a classic example of the expert dictators making mistakes with people's lives, having no incentive to make the right decision.\n\n \n Yes. The administrators are stupid and frivolous, but any people are like that when they get into power. There are many well-stocked private schools that do the same thing, yet nothing changes with them, so I am skeptical about how much better they are from an objective standpoint.\n \n There are also public schools which do better than private schools, but it really depends on where you are going and what subject is under discussion, and what grade is considered. Also the population composition determines success.\n \n \n \n\n People aren't equal in terms of individual attributes, such as intelligence or strength. But we can't arbitrarily set values for different attributes and determine some individuals superior and others inferior. \n\n \n I disagree. Tjere are quasi-lines between the inferior and the superior. It's not race, it's not money, it's intelligence and aptitude. Those are the two most important differences among people. Many are blessed through natural selection, many are not. Those who are, are superior whilst those who aren't get swept asunder, or, through Liberalism, get supported.\n \n \n \n We are all individuals. We all have the right to direct our own lives and own what we make. We are different, but equal.\n \n \n \n\n \"The truth needs state support.\" That is the premise behind theocracy. God forbid that the stupid masses start questioning the unquestionable truth!\n\n \n If only the masses cared about the \"truth.\" Sadly, they don't care about science and math. They care about Adam and Eve.\n \n \n\n Words, not swords, are the way to convince people of the truth. If evolution is true, then it should win out in the free market of ideas. Evolution was able to gain support even when creationism was being taught in public schools. The strength of the theory is immense. And I say it is stupid to rig the contest in favor of the competitor that is bound to win anyway.\n\n \n In happy land where people are rational and care about the truth, your way works. Words and a Market. In reality, with so many Fundamentalists and the current masses, this is near-impossible. They don't listen to reason or fact. You can state to them the second law of thermodynamics, and they will STILL parrot that Evolution Violates it. \n \n They non-stop parrot all the commonly refuted relgious dogma, yet it's still taught and memorized, but not inside of public schools. It runs freely in the private sphere of parent-fundie domination.\n \n \n \n \n\n I think that when the public schools are turned to private business, they should be put in the hands of those who will continue to teach the old curriculum. That way, rationalist schools will be present in high numbers AND have a natural market advantage over the irrational schools. Evolution theory will not suddenly collapse when the state withdraws its support (that is, unless it's a bad theory, which it isn't.)\n\n \n There needs to be supervision and administrative responsibility to someone else, other than themselves and parents. No, evolutionary theory won't suddenly collapse, but it will surely give a big open window to fundie parents who number near 40 some million to send their children to the \"science curriculum\" of their choice. They cannot do that that effectively with so few private schools and government intervention.\n \n You seem to think that a Theory's merit and truth is what makes it successful. It's not. That only matters among the intellectuals and mainstream officials--not among the masses. According to the masses, sytle beats substance and truth.\n \n The masses will go for the easy, dogmatic things they want, and since they are paying, they will dicatate what can and cannot be taught, and they will go to schools that cater to this. A near majority in the United States are religious fundamentalists. IT's not a good idea to give them free reign.",

   ".\n \n Education is not a utilitarian tool. It is meant to form people into well rounded individuals, capable of critical thought and able to both understand and appreciate everything around them. It is as much about social learning and exposure to as many things possible as it is to ultimately teach you arithmetic. Education should be about exposure to as many ideas and concepts as possible, allowing the student to choose from as broad a base as possible, and at the same time, giving that student an understanding of the concepts that others have chosen.\n \n To suggest that the sole purpose of education is create robots solely equipped for the purposes of undertaking one job or trade or is simplistic and naive. Education is far more than that.\n \n Waxy\n \n \n I would agree with all these sentiments and wish only to add that, in my view, education is a process of initiation into ways of \"seeing the world\". The \"initiated\" have usually not only mastered a definite corpus of knowledge and acquired specific mental skills etc., but they have also internalised what might be called certain intellectual characteristics - which include independent judgement and the disinterested pursuit of truth.",

Pretty much in our school our textbooks talk about how fair and equal and perfect all these checks and balances are, how great America is, and blah blah blah. But the teachers encouraged us to have discussions about this stuff. We had to write an essay on whether checks and balances helped the government process or got in the way. We discussed both sides and our teacher didn't have a bias either way. He pointed out arguments other people use from both sides but never even told us what his opinion on stuff like this was. There was one kid who thought our government should be many separate governments all based on religion and governed the way the different religions wanted to. Instead of telling him it was ridiculous and to shut up, he raised some questions about what if someone wanted to marry someone of another religion and encouraged him to think about it.

The \"doers\" are the ones who actually build producty and push profit, and you don't need a whole lot of \"thinkers\" to organise a lot of \"doers\"\n\n \n Besides, if you are in power, and you seek to maintain and gain that power, and your moral compass is only to avoid breaking the law, naturally you will want the masses to be skilled, but not critical thinkers...they are easier to manipulate and you are more likely to be able to retain your power. Anyone meeting that description indeed prefers robots for most of the population.\n \n -Mach",

It really depends upon what your goal is or desires are. America is a lovely country, but there are both benefits and problems.\n \n I never learned in my school that America was infallible or that checks and balances work perfectly. In fact, in my economics classes, we routinely learn that American is relatively free economically, but not the most free. There are a great many other nations which are not as free, economically, however. I think the US is about #6, and France is like #40.\n \n \n \n Personally, I think Education should be a Utilitarian tool used by society. It can be a mix of essentialist and pragmatic concerns. It ought to make an efficient, good citizen while teaching them something that is useful in their own lives and careers. There should be earlier specialization of interests and more concentration of Math, Science, and utilitarian languages.\n \n Education should also be used as a social reform tool.",

It fits too well with a quote attributed to Hitler; \"Give me control of the textbooks and I will control the nation.\"\n \n\n \n Public schools with oversight can do it just as much as private schools would and do every day. Except public schools are at least largely secular.\n \n \n The conservatives are trying to use education as a manipulative tool.\n\n \n I won't disagree with you there. I don't like conservatives either.\n \n \n\n When I was in high school, I had to take a class called ELPS (Economic, Legal, & Political Systems.) \n\n \n Ok, so? It's good to know about legal and economic issues.\n \n \n\n Half of the class was capitalist indoctrination.\n\n \n What do you consider indoctriation? What do you consider learning? Capitalism is a good system. The best there is, although with many problems, that can, and are, addressed by other theories and systems.\n \n \n\n We were even made to conduct a simulation of capitalism and socialism - the simulations were not realistic at all, since they ignored labor, land ownership, and practically every economic factor except \"Oh, now everybody has six paperclips. \n\n \n You do know that this personal experience is totally untestable for anyone else and non-researchable. It's a subjective experience from which you are making a general conclusion.\n \n This is the epitome of the hasty generalization fallacy. Just because you had that problem does not mean it's always or mostly like that. Prove to me it is. WHen you do, I will believe you, but not before that.\n \n \n\n Go on and trade now... <no trade takes place.< You see, that's socialism.\"\n\n \n I am sorry for the gross incompetence you had to experience, but that's far from what it's like everywhere. I won't use personal experience to make my case, but if you would like to know, my school wasn't like that---at all. Your idiot school district is the problem.\n \n One problem with local schoolboards, which i despise, is that they are parents with some agenda or \"in-for-it\" attitude with their schools. They get ****** off at something and they try to take it out on the school. As well, the typical regional school district is an odd number, 11 memembers, while a smaller local district is made up of 9 elected members. Many of these people are laymen with NO teaching/administration ability or time to deal with any problems.\n \n They screw stuff up because they do not have the credientials to run school boards and they have tremendous figthing with the schools over budgetary issues, for the stupidest of reasons. They need to be done away with and put in the hands of someone who's educated.\n \n \n \n\n Indoctrination. That is a social reform tool.\n\n \n \n Lots of rhetoric, but no real substance. Indoctrination is different from social reform. That's why there are two separate words for them and equally separate definitions in the dictionary. I can lead you to a websters if you want?\n \n School should, in part, be a force for social progressivism and reconstruction. You are free to disagree, I don't really care all that much. Education is where people learn, and it's one of the best places to teach people to be tolerant, diverse, and explore options to make society better.",
