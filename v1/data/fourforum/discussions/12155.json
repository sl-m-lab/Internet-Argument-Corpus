His end-rant was heavy-handed and over the top (IMO), but a lot of his preceding criticism went to the facts without being too overtly insulting.\n \n I think he's got a pretty impressive point regarding the \"Mormon\" and \"Scientology\" beliefs and how they are viewed, as compared to other \"more accepted\" beliefs like Christianity which believe things that are comparatively absurd yet overlooked.",
