   "This thread has been sparked by another thread which I found to be particularly insensitive and irrational. Rather than contributing to the imbecility in that thread, I decided to start my own in order to put some of my observations on the record. The specific observation I am making can be discerned from the thread's title; specifically, I have seen a correlation between pro-gay rhetoric and anti-Christian rhetoric among some of the posters in this particular forum. To be clear, I did say some posters. No doubt some will respond that they observe the exact opposite taking place; some may say that they perceive there to be a correlation between anti-gay rhetoric and pro-Christian rhetoric. I will not dispute that. I have seen some of that myself, although I would disagree with the person who would claim that it is prevalent on this forum. Regardless, that is not my point. My point is to offer my thoughts on the relationship expressed by the thread's title. And I want to be very clear that I would not have started this thread if one particular thread had not been started.\n \n I submit that some of the posting in the thread started by MatthewS demonstrates prejudice toward Christians. I also submit that such prejudice ought not to be articulated in a discussion forum for many reasons, the least of which is that posting in a prejudiced manner is against the forum rules. But since we do not live in a particularly respectful world, and this type of posting has already taken place, I will do the next best thing and take it head on.\n \n What we have in the thread MatthewS started is a conclusion based upon a presumption that the church where the shootings happened: \"preach[ed] hate,\" \"support[ed] terrorism,\" and sought to promote an atmosphere of \"judgmentalism and retribution.\" There was also the suggestion that the individual victims at the church were not innocent and were \"guilty by association\" of hatred. Thus, the logical conclusion of the post is that the victims truly were not innocent, and therefore deserved to be victims. The corollary of that viewpoint, incidentally, is that the perpetrator did nothing wrong. It is true that no one openly asserted the latter two statements, and I find it interesting that no one seems willing to follow their logic to the end.\n \n Though I have seen it asserted multiple times in this forum, I do not recall anyone ever proving, or even coming close to justifying, the claim that Christian churches in general, or New Life Church in particular, preach hate. I certainly await the day when someone attempts to make a rational case for that claim, rather than just articulating their own prejudiced conclusion. It was that unjustified conclusion that was the basis upon which many made their argument that the church was in some way responsible for the shooting. The facts simply do not bear that out. And it is precisely this blatant ignorance of the facts that have led me to the conclusion that the anti-Christian pile on that has happened is the result of nothing but prejudice.\n \n Take for example the assertion that the attacks were \"a consequence of judgmental Christianist thinking, because the perpetrator was a product of that church.\" We can examine an interesting thing about this statement. We can note that it is false. It is false for no other reason than that it is simply not true. The shooter was not a member of the church which he attacked, and he had never been a member of it. The poster asserts a conclusion that is in search of the facts; but when we locate the facts, we find that the conclusion simply is untrue. But that does not hamper it from being asserted anyway.\n \n Through all of this I have come to a rather unfortunate conclusion in the last few days. I have concluded that many in this forum simply have a narrative that they wish to advance, and no facts which contradict that narrative will bar them from advancing it. The narrative is that gays are not getting something that they want, and it is the religious (specifically, the Christians) who are preventing them from getting what they want. This has led, ironically, to the nonsense that occurs on these forums. The kind of nonsense I refer to is the preaching of tolerance, but the practicing of intolerance; demanding that Christians practice tolerance, but practicing intolerance toward Christians. We have apparently come to the point where it is logical to condemn hate (if hate it really is) by hating. Applying a standard to others that we do not apply to ourselves is a textbook example of hypocrisy. Condemning people because of their hate, and then hating them in return is the essence of hypocrisy.\n \n I invite anyone to own up and prove that hatred is the norm among Christian churches generally, or New Life Church specifically.",

   "To be clear, that is not exactly what I was doing. I was not attacking \"one poster in particular.\" I actually had four or five posters in mind. I only identified MatthewS as the person who started the thread in order to refer to the tread (because I didn't want to bring direct attention to said thread). I did not single out anyone specifically for criticism, and hence my post was not a personal attack on anyone. I did quote several individuals without identifying them in order to present the ideas that I was addressing. Sure, one could (if they wanted) identify specific individuals by going back and comparing what I quoted with those individuals, but my failure to single anyone out is the proof that it was not a personal attack on anyone, though it could be labeled as a personal attack on ideas that I find repugnant.\n \n Finally, I simply repeat the invitation I offered in my initial post:\n Originally Posted by Phyllis\n I invite anyone to own up and prove that hatred is the norm among Christian churches generally, or New Life Church specifically.\n\n \n Phyllis, I've seen you in operation, and you are no slouch at the personal attack. This was one against Matthew because you did single him out.\n \n As for your invitation, have you read the tripe about homosexuals emanating from the Vatican under Herr Ratzinger, and previously when Herr Ratzinger headed the Inquisition, ooops, sorry, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, under Pan Wojtyla (who called himself John-Paul II, though he had nothing in common with either of his recent predecessors; and I cannot bring myself to refer to Herr Ratzinger as \"Benedict\", as that is the antithesis of what he stands for)? It beggars belief. And the New Life church was the creation of Pastor Ted Haggard, a closeted, self-loathing homosexual whose preachings against gays were public knowledge -- so far as I know, he hasn't recanted, just pretended he was \"healed\" of homosexuality in three weeks! Begorrah, another miracle. Jesus be praised! And what about the condemnations of gay people by certain Anglican clergy, in Africa and the US?\n \n There is, if you will excuse me, a scheiss-load of evidence about the hatred many Christian churches and clergy hold for gay people. All you have to do is hold your gag reflex and read it. It will take you years to get through, there is so much of it out there.\n \n And before you make jyosh's asinine mistake, no, I do not generalise to all Christians.

   "This thread has been sparked by another thread which I found to be particularly insensitive and irrational. Rather than contributing to the imbecility in that thread, I decided to start my own in order to put some of my observations on the record. The specific observation I am making can be discerned from the thread's title; specifically, I have seen a correlation between pro-gay rhetoric and anti-Christian rhetoric among some of the posters in this particular forum. To be clear, I did say some posters. No doubt some will respond that they observe the exact opposite taking place; some may say that they perceive there to be a correlation between anti-gay rhetoric and pro-Christian rhetoric. I will not dispute that. I have seen some of that myself, although I would disagree with the person who would claim that it is prevalent on this forum. Regardless, that is not my point. My point is to offer my thoughts on the relationship expressed by the thread's title. And I want to be very clear that I would not have started this thread if one particular thread had not been started.\n \n I submit that some of the posting in the thread started by MatthewS demonstrates prejudice toward Christians. I also submit that such prejudice ought not to be articulated in a discussion forum for many reasons, the least of which is that posting in a prejudiced manner is against the forum rules. But since we do not live in a particularly respectful world, and this type of posting has already taken place, I will do the next best thing and take it head on.\n \n What we have in the thread MatthewS started is a conclusion based upon a presumption that the church where the shootings happened: \"preach[ed] hate,\" \"support[ed] terrorism,\" and sought to promote an atmosphere of \"judgmentalism and retribution.\" There was also the suggestion that the individual victims at the church were not innocent and were \"guilty by association\" of hatred. Thus, the logical conclusion of the post is that the victims truly were not innocent, and therefore deserved to be victims. The corollary of that viewpoint, incidentally, is that the perpetrator did nothing wrong. It is true that no one openly asserted the latter two statements, and I find it interesting that no one seems willing to follow their logic to the end.\n \n Though I have seen it asserted multiple times in this forum, I do not recall anyone ever proving, or even coming close to justifying, the claim that Christian churches in general, or New Life Church in particular, preach hate. I certainly await the day when someone attempts to make a rational case for that claim, rather than just articulating their own prejudiced conclusion. It was that unjustified conclusion that was the basis upon which many made their argument that the church was in some way responsible for the shooting. The facts simply do not bear that out. And it is precisely this blatant ignorance of the facts that have led me to the conclusion that the anti-Christian pile on that has happened is the result of nothing but prejudice.\n \n Take for example the assertion that the attacks were \"a consequence of judgmental Christianist thinking, because the perpetrator was a product of that church.\" We can examine an interesting thing about this statement. We can note that it is false. It is false for no other reason than that it is simply not true. The shooter was not a member of the church which he attacked, and he had never been a member of it. The poster asserts a conclusion that is in search of the facts; but when we locate the facts, we find that the conclusion simply is untrue. But that does not hamper it from being asserted anyway.\n \n Through all of this I have come to a rather unfortunate conclusion in the last few days. I have concluded that many in this forum simply have a narrative that they wish to advance, and no facts which contradict that narrative will bar them from advancing it. The narrative is that gays are not getting something that they want, and it is the religious (specifically, the Christians) who are preventing them from getting what they want. This has led, ironically, to the nonsense that occurs on these forums. The kind of nonsense I refer to is the preaching of tolerance, but the practicing of intolerance; demanding that Christians practice tolerance, but practicing intolerance toward Christians. We have apparently come to the point where it is logical to condemn hate (if hate it really is) by hating. Applying a standard to others that we do not apply to ourselves is a textbook example of hypocrisy. Condemning people because of their hate, and then hating them in return is the essence of hypocrisy.\n \n I invite anyone to own up and prove that hatred is the norm among Christian churches generally, or New Life Church specifically.\n\n \n Hi Phyllis, I thought it time to respond directly to your OP as it has been directly ignored thus far by the intended recipients. Both your critique of what motivates the radical gay crusaders here and your conclusions regarding their consistent abuse and condemnation of Christianity and Christians as responsible for all of the perceived injustices due to them not getting all of the social benefits they seek is totally accurate and is well stated.\n \n A simple perusal of every thread started by any of them will show the same basic assertions throughout them all. And that is that gays are victims and christians are the aggressors who seek to deny them their equal rights. I have much more I can say on this subject but I find if I say too much at once it is ignored anyway by the opposition forces who will as usual, converge upon me enmasse to confuse and obfuscate the valid points you made and which I am agreeing with.",

   "I would like to address the OP, the original post in this thread. I personally have never claimed, and have never thought, that most Christian churches preach \"hate.\" So I cannot \"prove\" that they do, as I do not think they do. I don't begin with that belief or that assumption. \n \n I have found that many Christian churches take the position that \"homosexuality is a sin,\" though how often ministers actually address this topic in sermons, I don't know. I don't regard this as \"hate\" necessarily, although some people who call themselves Christians do indeed \"hate\" gay people, and even some who call themselves ministers, notably Fred Phelps, do claim that \"God hates f&gs.\" Phelps is, of course, an extremist rejected by most Christians, from what I can see. \n \n I think that when asked, most Christians would probably say they do not \"hate\" gay people; they \"hate the sin\" of \"homosexuality.\" Of course, this belief that \"homosexuality is a sin\" is not benign. It shapes how many churches treat gay people. And many churches insist that they will embrace gay people only if gay people \"repent\" of the \"sin\" of \"homosexuality.\" This explains why so few gay people ever join those particular churches. \n \n Christians have held similar kinds of beliefs about women's position in the churches and society. Some conservative Christians today insist that \"feminism\" is a \"sin.\" They regard the movement for women's equality as a movement inspired by \"Satan.\" They of course insist that they don't hate women, which they don't. But they regard anyone who advocates women's equality in the churches and in society as promoting \"sin,\" because that is not, in their view, what the Bible calls for. The arguments about women are less intense today within the churches than they were in the past. \n \n On the flip side, there are Christians who are very active and outspoken in favor of both equal treatment for women and equal treatment for and acceptance of gay people in the churches and in the wider society. There is an intense battle going on within Christianity right now about the issue of \"homosexuality\" and how Christians should treat gay people. I'm not entirely sure why this battle has become so fierce, but it has. The battle over \"homosexuality\" has become more intense recently than has the battle over abortion, from what I can see. Maybe the anti-abortion forces have become tired and a spent and are just waiting for what they hope will be a ruling in their favor by the Supreme Court. I don't know, because I don't engage in many discussions of abortion with conservative Christians. But it seems to me that Christians are engaged more passionately in a debate over \"homosexuality\" than over any other issue at the moment.",
