   "I recently heard about this book, which a group of his former veterans wrote about him. I have ordered it and should be getting it soon, but first I wanted people's thoughts on it. \n \n The publisher says:\n \n Find out why John Kerry is Unfit for Command as told by the men who served with him.\n Unfit for Command reveals a John Kerry you don't know-the true John Kerry that his political image-makers are trying to hide. But the veterans who served with him know better, and in Unfit for Command, they tell their story, including: \n * How all three of John Kerry's Purple Hearts were for minor injuries, easily treated with band-aids, not requiring a single hour of hospitalization \n * How captured Americans were tortured in North Vietnamese prisons for not endorsing John Kerry's false testimony-before the United States Senate-about alleged American war crimes \n * How John Kerry carried a typewriter and an 8-mm home movie camera with him to Vietnam so he could record his own exaggerated version of his war exploits and film staged reenactments of his \"combat actions\" to advance his political career \n * Why John Kerry's photograph hangs in a place of honor in the Vietnamese communist \"War Remnants Museum\" in Saigon \n Want to know the real John Kerry? Read Unfit for Command-and prepare to be shocked.  \n \n \n The Inside Flap says:\n \n John Kerry, War Hero? Guess again. John O'Neill was the naval officer who took over John Kerry's swift boat in the muddy waters of Vietnam. What he learned convinced him-and convinced the majority of veterans who served directly with Kerry-that John Kerry was and is unfit for command at the lowliest rank in the Navy, let alone as commander in chief of the United States. In this stunning new book, John O'Neill and his coauthor Dr. Jerome Corsi (an expert on the anti-Vietnam War movement) have interviewed dozens of veterans who served with Kerry and have meticulously documented a shameful record of betrayal and deception on the part of John Kerry. \n In Unfit for Command you'll learn: \n * How two of John Kerry's three Purple Heart decorations resulted from self-inflicted wounds, not suffered under enemy fire \n * Why John Kerry's third Purple Heart \"fanny wound\" was the highlight of his much touted \"no man left behind\" Bronze Star \n * How John Kerry turned the tragic death of a father and small child in a Vietnamese fishing boat into an act of \"heroism\" by filing a false report on the incident. \n * How John Kerry entered an abandoned Vietnamese village and slaughtered the domestic animals owned by the civilians and burned down their homes with his Zippo lighter \n * How John Kerry's reckless behavior convinced his colleagues that he had to go-becoming the only swift boat veteran to serve only four-months in Vietnam \n * How as a leader of Vietnam Veterans Against the War, John Kerry attended a meeting where plans were discussed to assassinate prominent United States Senators who supported the war \n * How Kerry met secretly with communist delegates at the Paris Peace Conference during the Vietnam War, and why some believe he violated the Uniform Code of Military Justice and federal law \n Based on detailed interviews with Swift Boat veterans who served in Vietnam with John Kerry and on recently released FBI surveillance reports of John Kerry's anti-war activities, Unfit for Command is a shocking indictment of a politician who slandered his fellow veterans, danced on the edge of treason, and has shamelessly exaggerated his own war service for political ends \n \n \n \n Assuming this is true, do you think it could discredit Kerry? He dedicated a large part of the movie at the DNC to talking about his time in Vietnam, and he also had a few of his veterans at the DNC. Now that this book is out, does anybody believe Kerry anymore?",

Thomas Wright said he frequently was forced to confront Mr. Kerry over willful disobedience to orders while aboard Swift Boat patrols. \n \n He told radio host Kevin McCullough that on frequent occasions Mr. Kerry would randomly fire at \"things he thought were moving\" along the shoreline. The lieutenant stated that protocol was to fire only when the unit was receiving hostile fire. He explained that part of the patrol's goal was to develop contacts with noncombatants living along the rivers. \n \n He said when confronted about his defiance, Mr. Kerry would either claim he didn't hear the orders or insist that he thought \"he saw something\" moving. \n \n The former commanding officer's boldest claim was that after Mr. Kerry received his third Purple Heart, he and two other ranking officers flat-out asked the now Democratic presidential candidate to leave his unit because his behavior put the group in greater vulnerability and danger. \n \n Mr. Kerry, he said, replied that he would not leave, \"but was out of there by morning.\"\n \n \n \n Look at the \"real Band of Brothers\" link.",

It undercuts your argument quite nicely.\n \n Btw, a dear ol' friend of mine has justed pointed me in the direction that easily disproved 99% of the lies about the Swift Boats comming from Republicans\n\n \n \n \n So in other words, all 30 some odd Vietnam Veterans are conspiring to bring Kerry down, much the same as most Liberals claim Bush and MI-6, Russian intelligence, CIA intelligence, Egypt, and Jordan are feeding lies to Bush to further his war in Iraq? Give me a break. \n \n The one vet (George Elliot) who said he denounced his comments now says that \"the article appearing in today's edition of the BOSTON GLOBE by Mike Kranish was extremely inaccurate and highly misstating.\" He also \"reaffirms his request that the ad be played.\" So apparently something in those ads has to be true.\n \n We shall see what the book has to say when it comes out. Why doesn't Kerry just come out and release his records? Then we will really find out who is telling the truth and who is lying. Bush released his. Why won't Kerry? Does he have something to hide? And instead if researching the ad and trying to prove that the vets are lying, Kerry sends out memos to the TV stations playing the ads and threatens to sue them if they don't take it off the air?
