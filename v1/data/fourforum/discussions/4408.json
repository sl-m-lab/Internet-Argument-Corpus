The handgun is small and lightweight and easily concealed in a person's \n \n \n It looks like the anti gunners are at it again, only now they have a new target. \n \n For those who do not follow such things, the FN five seven fires a new round, the 5.7x28. There are 2 versions of the round availabe, one is an aluminum base, steel core, FMJ round designed to pierce body armor. It is not available to civilians int he US, it is law enforcement only. The other round avaliable IS a civilian round, it is a hollowpoint which has already been cleared by the ATF as a non armor piercing round.\n \n The civilian round (the non AP one) WILL pierce body armor, as will a .22 magnum, and most solid point .22 LR rounds. Body armor is specifically designed to take the implact from large, slow moving rounds, not small, fast rounds.\n \n I am also a little confused as to what makes this an \"assault pistol\". I have 2 of them. I purchsed them specifically because when the civilian version came out, I fully expected that thet antigunners would pitch a fit and we would see attempts to ban the weapon, which would boost the value of them. They pretty much look like a glock. Why is the five seven an \"assault pistol\" and the glock is not? \n \n While I am sure we are all used to GG's pushing for bans that have no basis in reality, even I was a little surprised that they moved so quickly on this one.\n \n \n \n Now, my anti social side is pushing me to pass on a secret regarding AP rounds. If you want a REALLY good AP round, get a 7.62x25 (tokarev). You can pick up a pistol for this caliber VERY cheap ($200 or less for a good makarov). Hand load your rounds, but instead of using the 7.62, order some .30 sabots. You can get them from a bunch of places (just do a search for \".30 sabot\" on google). They cost about $10 for 100 of them. Load your 7.62x25 with a fast burning powder, and you can load a heavier powder load. Use a .223 speer FMJ.\n \n Our experiments (we experimented with this at work when we were working on a contract related to ceramic body armor) showed that this will go through TWO kevlar vests and 16 inched of ballistics gel, which implies rather heavily that you can reasonably expect to shoot right through 2 police officers using the round, vest or no.\n \n This being the case, doesn't it seem a little frivolous to be banning a weapon, and the ammo for that weapon, especially since the ATF has already given it the green light as non AP?",

   "Just curious, how legal is that?\n\n \n 100%\n \n In order for a round to be considered \"armor piercing\", it has to have a penetrator. As long as you are not using .223 with a penetrator, you have NO legal issues at a federal level. \n \n That particular round penetrated EVERY piece of body armor that we tested with the exception of the new stuff we were testing. The new stuff is a composite, a ceramic metal matrix shell over a honeycomb carbon composite. I weighed 85 lbs, so it is not something that you are going to see guys running around in (though I do have several sets that we constructed for the testing that I could sell for around $200,000.00 each). \n \n You MIGHT have feed problems (we did) with the round, in which case you need to take a dremel and smooth out your feed ramp. No big deal. Out of a makarov (short barrel) we were getting around 2850 FPS. Out of a bizon (15 inch barrel) we were at about 3000 FPS, well into rifle velocity land. \n \n The REAL benifit to a round like this (since I assume that most people are not simply looking to load cop killers) is that you have in inherently stable round, the .223, being fired at near rifle velocity, from a pistol. The round is stable to roughly 150 yards, then it begins to deteriorate. 3\" groupings at 100 yards with our old POS test weapon were not uncommon. 1.5\" with the bizon.",

Professional bad guys now use body armor as frequently as law enforcement.

I prefer to rely on eight semi-auto shots, each containing nine pellets of .33 caliber buckshot from an 18\" barrel, and if that doesn't do the job, a full-auto clip of 32 rounds of 9mm. If those who make their living preying on other citizens go to full body armor covering head and appendages, I'd like the AP option left open. Better safe than sorry is my motto.",

But if the poster is not a law enforcement officer or in the business flack vest design, here is my opinion on AP ammo....\n\n \n Flack vests, no.....ceramic armor, including personal clamshel armor...yes. We are one of only 3 faciltites with the specialised equipment required to build prototypes for the DOD's new ceramic armour designs. \n \n This is why we were experimenting with such things. The new ceramic armor concepts that are being developed, mostly a ceramic metal matrix with a honeycomb structure, will stop just about anything that one is likely to find on a battlefield (unlike the current offerings, that really only offer protection directly under the trauma plate). We found that high powered, small rounds could penetrate it. While the saboted 7.62x35 mentioned here could not, a saboted 308 or 30/06 could.\n \n \n For the average shooter , gun enthusiast, handloader like myself, I see no reason for ANY civilian gun owner to have a interest in AP ammo, unless it is for the R&D for better flack vest design. Flack vests are the last line of defense that our police have against the criminals that are shooting at them , why would a person promote AP ammo for civilian usage ?

Citizen\" spraying the flack vested robbers at the local liquor store, with his AP ammo shootin' AK rifle, just does not fit in to the realm of rational thinking. Correct me if I have read this post wrong , If I have, my apologies to the poster are extended,\n\n \n Personally, my home defense weapon is loaded with AP rounds. Of course, they are not specifically AP, but properly loaded 9mm ball from a 12\" barrel will penetrate any current production vest. I made the switch after being informed by one of my local sheriffs deupties that nearly 70% of burglars aprehended last year in \"hot\" burglaries (where the homeowner was there) were wearing bulletproof vests. Vests are cheap now, they are cheap insurance for cops, and they are cheap insurace for burglars.\n \n I personally load saboted rounds because they are more accurate. The large caliber handgun ammo we use looses stability fairly quickly as distance increases. Small rounds like the .223 retain stability linger, but bleed velocity quickly over distance.\n \n I can hit a paper plate 10 times at 100 yards in 7 seconds with a match grade 1911 firing hand loaded rounds. That is a $5000 pistol. I can hit the same paper plate 10 times in 4.5 seconds firing a saboted .223 out of a $200 surplus makarov. Since the mass of the round is so greatly decreased, and the polymer jacket goes down the barrel with less friction than the a standard round, recoil is greatly reduced so follow up time is reduced.\n \n I apologise if the point of my post was unclear. I was merely trying to make the point that banning specific weapons, or specific caliber ammo, merely because they have the capability of piercing a vest is ludicrous. If you go down that road, and make it your mission to ban every caliber that could potentially pierce a vest, in short order we will all be firing .22 shorts only. and while that may be a good round for squirrels or rabbits, I would hate to go on my yearly elk hunt armed with such a weapon.\n \n I recived a forward today from a buddy in law enforcement. It an Email issued by the ATF, a \"heads up\" to law enforcement regarding the five seven. The email states clearly that the only rounds available to the general public for the five seven are the hollow point, non AP rounds that were approved by the ATF. It does point out that the hollowpoint still has the capability of piercing most vests due to its small cross section and relatively high velocity.\n \n The point they stress in the Email is not the AP capablity of the weapon, but its accuracy. They warn that \"In every confronation where the suspect is armed with an FN Five-seven, you must treat the situation as if they were armed with a rifle\".\n \n If this is indeed the real issue, that the weapon is too accurate, then I think we have a real problem. \n \n Personally, I think that the Five-seven represents the new paradigm in firearms design. It has become apparent that people prefer a high cap magazine to a more powerful round (thus the switch from .45 to 9mm). The Five Seven carries a 20 rd magazine internally. While it is not likely to blow the back of a guys head off like a .45 or a 9mm hollow poiint, I think people have finally realised that removal of the entire rear of a persons cranium is not required to get the desired effect, and frankly, when you have a 20 rd mag, you can afford to shoot the bastard twice. H&K has a new(er) personal defensive weapon that fires a reound very similar to the 5.7x28. S&W, Ruger, and glock all have new high powered, small caliber handguns in the works, though none have announced exactly what caliber those weapons are likely to chamber.\n \n It seems to me that the real \"danger\" here is that people will convert these pistols to select fire weapons. there have been FA pistols available for a long time from beretta, sig, glock, and a few others, but they are always chambered in 9mm, which makes them mostly worthless as a select fire weapon since by the time you put a big enough magazine on it to make it useful, the mag is hanging 6\" out of the handle. A weapon like the Five-Seven, with a 20 rd INTERNAL magazine, could actually be somewhat useful as a FA. \n \n Criminals have routinely stayed away from FA for the most part, since unless you have some kind of supply line available to keep feeding you magazines, or you are carrying several pounds of ammo, they are not good for a whole lot. The ability to carry 100 rds of high powered ammo in 5 small mags, though changes that equation.",

   "I think this is largely based on location. I live far out in the country. if one of my AP rounds goes through a wall and kills a guy on the other side of the street, odds are he was a bad guy too, and just hadn't made it into the house yet.\n \n The question of acceptable force is also location based. Here in Kansas, there is no such thing as \"undue force\" in regards to burglars. You are more than welcome to beat, stab, shoot, maim or burn anybody who breaks into your home, regardless of circumstance. We are just quirky like that.\n \n A while back there was a guy who caught somebody breaking into his house. he had the guy on his knees in the middle of the living room floor and was waiting for the police to arrive. While he waited, there was apparently an unpleasant verbal exchange, and he walked up behind the guy and executed him. No charges were ever filed. The only two questions that really matter in Kansas are \"Was the person in your house\" and \"did they belong there\".

   "Quote \"I think this is largely based on location. I live far out in the country. if one of my AP rounds goes through a wall and kills a guy on the other side of the street, odds are he was a bad guy too, and just hadn't made it into the house yet.\n \n The question of acceptable force is also location based. Here in Kansas, there is no such thing as \"undue force\" in regards to burglars. You are more than welcome to beat, stab, shoot, maim or burn anybody who breaks into your home, regardless of circumstance. We are just quirky like that.\n \n A while back there was a guy who caught somebody breaking into his house. he had the guy on his knees in the middle of the living room floor and was waiting for the police to arrive. While he waited, there was apparently an unpleasant verbal exchange, and he walked up behind the guy and executed him. No charges were ever filed. The only two questions that really matter in Kansas are \"Was the person in your house\" and \"did they belong there\".

Nobody is going to take care of you, so you had best be ready to take care of your self and your own.\n \n\n \n At my place in Northern Idaho near the Canadian Border, sheriff's response time was about 45-minutes in good weather, much longer with 3-4' of snow on the ground, maybe none in a storm. You take care of yourself, period. A country store is the only 'public' building for miles, and if the sheriff has a warrant to serve or wants to talk to anyone in that area, he leaves word at the store for the individual to call him. Kind of a gentleman's agreement both sides honor. You can get badly hurt or killed by not minding your own business and if caught stealing from people barely making it, disappear. Not all that far from where the Ruby Ridge incident took place. \n \n Above Bonner's Ferry, before crossing into Canada, a local store right before the border does a business in checking guns for those crossing into Canada. You get a claim check, they lock your guns up and you pay a rental fee when redeeming them. Virtually every vehicle with an Idaho plate stops at that store before entering Canada and when leaving. \n \n Much of America has absolutely no idea of what goes on more than 100 feet from their home/workplace and what their TV allows them to digest. I always feel much safer in a truly rural setting than cities, because everyone knows the rules and there are no illusions about what law enforcement can do to protect the populace. Law enforcement is always an after the crime public service, a fact often neglected by idealistic anti-gun advocates in a country rife with deep social ills.",

I think it should extend to property lines. When I was last in Southern California, everything but small pockets like Beverly Hills, Malibu, Irvine and other enclaves with prosperity levels high enough to afford tax enabled state of the art police forces with high ratios of cop/residents had serious bars on the windows. I read of a wealthy city in the Palm Beach area of Florida that has a cop for every five residents. Those who can afford it are back to building moats around residences, only this time around, instead of water, they're electronic and staffed with contracted, well-armed private armies. Although at the rate our leaders are pushing us into insolvency, I'll soon be able to afford my own private paramilitary protection I can arm, house, feed and uniform for peanuts. They'll prefer that to living in the real danger our inner-cities and suburban areas are very capable of producing.",

Personally, I keep a team of professionally trained attack dogs (3) as a first line of defense, backed up by a fairly decent arsenal that I have no reservations about using should it be required. My home is my castle, and I have no reservations against defending it. \n \n I used to just keep a 1911 as a home defense weapon, until a local sheriffs deputy that I am friendly with convinced me to think on a slightly more lethal scale. He said \"You have built a nice place out here, and if something happens, there is no way anybody is going to get here in time to find anything but bodies. Make sure yours isn't in the pile\". \n \n It made sense, and I already had the Uzi, which is reliable, compact enough for effective room sweeping operations, and packs enough punch in a short burst to ensure that the bad guy will not be getting back up.",
