   "I have written a book (Natural Design: a new theory of evolution) that replaces Darwin's theory of natural selection with a stronger and more scientific one. It tightens up the weaker, ambiguous and probabilistic aspects of Darwin's theory. The upshot is that there is no longer any scientific way to distinguish between \"life\" and \"non-life\".\n \n The implications of this stronger theory are highly disturbing, and the only way to live with them is to accept that a scientific view of the universe is incompatible with a \"human\" one. In other words, scientifically speaking there is no difference between a rock, a virus, or a human in terms of the quantity \"life\" (although obviously there are differences in functional and structural complexity). As far as we - as humans - are concerned however, we may want to call viruses living.emoticon_xbouncer\n \n I am having difficulties getting this theory accepted by the academic establishment and so downloads of the book are available free at Lulu.com and under a \"you set the price\" system at Smashwords.com (search under my name or under the title of the book).",

   "My sympathies, Matthew. But I might point out that natural selection has been tested time and time again for the last 150+ years and has never been found lacking. So how, exactly, is your theory better? How have your tested your theory so that it can actually be called a theory rather than an hypothesis? (You do understand that a scientific theory has been rigorously tested, don't you?) What evidence in support of your \"theory\" have you presented to the established community of evolutionary biologists that you feel is being ignored? In other words, why should they listen to you? Your degrees in evolutionary biology are from what institutions?\n \n But I digress.\n \n I voted that a virus is not living because it does not have the ability to reproduce by itself. A virus must invade a living cell and use the reproductive ability of that cell to reproduce, whether they be DNA or RNA viruses.\n \n P.S. Matthew, \n \n When I tried to download your book at Lulu.com, the site told me that I did not have access to that page. Smashwords wanted information that I am not willing to offer.",

   "Hi Pandion, I tried sending this as a personal message, but I have not made enough posts to be able to do so.\n Thanks very much for your tolerant comment. Actually, I've decided to delete my message and get out of forums. I've received some scarily aggressive responses on another forum (Topix), which unfortunately I can't delete.\n However, at least I now know another reason for my difficulties - people confuse my book for one about Intelligent Design (though why rudeness and aggression is called for is beyond my understanding).\n As for your comments, there are many problems with the theory of natural selection, and so it CAN be said to have been found lacking (e.g. the huge 50% cost of sexual reproduction, the fatal genetic load/Haldane's dilemma problem, the difficulty of accounting for altruism, the problems of determining the correct \"level\" or \"unit\" of selection etc). Scientists have put up with these flaws because we have had no other choice. The reason people should listen to me is simple - the theoretical structure I provide removes all the problems that plague the Darwinian framework. It is more, not less, scientific (e.g. Darwin's theory is unavoidably, and unacceptably teleological).\n The other problem for my gaining acceptance is my lack of qualifications in this area. Although I have a BSc in Physics/Math, a BSc(Hons) in Soil Science, and was studying at Japan's elite Kyoto University for a PhD when I started this work, that is not enough. An editor at a famous academic University Press (one of the very few responses to enquiries I received - but only after I wrote again, demanding to know why I was being ignored) was kind enough to explain to me that he could not accept a book on this topic from me because the \"stuffy and opinionated\" (his words) academics in the review process would not tolerate my lack of qualifications and lack of publishing record in this area. He also commented that their publishing house would lose credibility if they published something that discredits other books previously published by them. I am not qualified in evolutionary biology or philosophy. But then neither (as far as I know) was Darwin. My book attacks his theory at a fundamental level. My relative ignorance of say genetics is of little relevance to what I write.\n Lulu.com often doesn't work properly! Have you tried searching under my name or the title of the book? I can send you a copy by email if you wish.\n I plan to delete this message tomorrow, so I hope you read it by then. I may remove my book from circulation too, and think a little more about how to get it accepted.",

   "Hi there & best wishes for getting your book published. \n \n In general, I feel a theory is the way we choose to make sense of the evidence. Any theory, including your own & Darwin's is to be evaluated in this same way. Does it make sense of the evidence? Does it make more sense than any other theory?\n \n & so it goes.\n \n \n\"An excellent analogy to the independence of the levels, Phaedrus thought, is the relation of hardware to software in a computer. ...\n \n It isn't necessary for a programmer to learn circuit design. Neither is it necessary for a hardware technician to learn programming. The 2 sets of patterns are independent. ...\n \n What makes all this significant to the Metaphysics of Quality is its striking parallelism to the interrelationship of different static patterns of quality. ...\n \n Certainly the novel cannot exist in the computer without a parallel pattern of voltages to support it. But that does not mean that the novel is an expression or property of those voltages. It doesn't have to exist in any electronic circuits at all. It can also reside in magnetic domains ... or a notebook ... or in the brain of the programmer, but even here it is neither composed of this brain nor possessed by it. The same program can be made to run on an infinite variety of computers. A program can change itself into a different program while it is running. It can turn on another computer, transfer itself into this second computer & shut off the first computer that it came from, destroying every lat trace of its origins - a process with similarities to biological reproduction.\n \n Trying to explain social moral patterns in terms of in-organic chemistry patterns is like trying to explain the plot of a word-processor novel in terms of the computer's circuits. You can't do it. You can see how the circuits make the novel possible, but they do not provide a plot for the novel. The novel is its own set of patterns. Similarly the biological patterns of life & the molecular patterns of organic chemistry have a \"machine language\" interface called DNA but that does not mean that the carbon or hydrogen or oxygen atoms possess or guide life. A primary occupation of every level of evolution seems to be offering freedom to lower levels of evolution. But as the higher level gets more sophisticated it goes off on purposes of its own. ...\n \n Now this vagueness is removed by sorting out values according to levels of evolution. The value that holds a glass of water together is an inorganic pattern of value. The value that holds a nation together is a social pattern of value. They are completely different from each other because they are at different evolutionary levels. & they are completely different from the biological pattern that can cause the most skeptical of intellectuals to leap from a hot stove. These patterns have nothing in common except for the historic evolutionary process that created all of them. But that is a process of value evolution. Therefore the name \"static pattern of values\" applies to all. ...\n \n Historically every effort to unite science & ethics has been a disaster. ...\n \n But the Metaphysics of Quality says, first of all, that \"amoral objective matter\" is a low-grade form of morality. No slough-off is possible. It states, second of all, that even if matter weren't a low grade form of morality there still would be no metaphysical need to show how morals are derived from it. With static patterns of value divided into 4 systems, conventional moral patterns have almost nothing to do with inorganic or biological nature. These moral patterns are superimposed upon inorganic nature the way novels are superimposed upon computers. They are more commonly opposed to biological patterns than they are supportive of them. \n \n & that is the key to the whole thing.\n \n What the evolutionary structure of the Metaphysics of Quality shows is that there is not just 1 moral system. There are many. In the Metaphysics of Quality there's the morality called the \"laws of nature,\" by which inorganic patterns triumph over chaos; there is a morality called the \"law of the jungle\" where biology triumphs over the inorganic forces of starvation & death; there's a morality where social patterns triumph over biology, \"the law\": & there is an intellectual morality, which is still struggling in its attempt to control society. Each of these moral codes is no more related to the other than novels are to flip-flops (circuit that stores a \"1\" or a \"0.\") ...\n \n The Metaphysics of Quality also clears up the mind-matter puzzle. ... & the \"free will vs. determinism controversy.\" \n \n He quotes the atomic physicist, Niels Bohr, who said, \"We are suspended in language.\" Our intellectual description of nature is always culturally derived. ...\n \n So what Phaedrus was saying was that not just life, but everything, is an ethical activity. It is nothing else. When inorganic patterns of reality create life the Metaphysics of Quality postulates that they've done so because it's \"better\" & that definition of \"betterness\" - this beginning response to Dynamic Quality - is an elementary unit of ethics upon which right & wrong can be based. \n \n In general, given a choice of 2 courses to follow & all other things being equal, that choice which is more Dynamic, that is at a higher level of evolution, is more moral. An example of this is the statement that, \"It's more moral for a doctor to kill a germ that to allow the germ to kill the patient.\" The germ wants to live. The patient wants to live. But the patient has moral precedence because he's at a higher level of evolution.\n \n Taken by itself that seems obvious enough. But what's not so obvious is that, given a value-centered Metaphysics of Quality, it is absolutely, scientifically moral for a doctor to prefer the patient. This is not just an arbitrary social convention that should apply to some doctors but not to all doctors, or to some cultures but not all cultures. It's true for all people at all times, now & forever, a moral pattern of reality as real as H20. We're at last dealing with morals on the basis of reason. We can deduce codes based on evolution that analyze moral arguments with greater precision than before.\"\n -Lila, An Inquiry into Morals by Robert Pirsig\n \n \n I think we are, in many ways, 'suspended in language'. After all, we do impose our narratives to describe our understandings of the world. What I like about this way of looking at things (from the book quote) is that it provides a framework for testing out thoughts, both on an individual level & as a bigger picture reality check. What I dislike about any type of framework is that it can become a prison of stagnation where thoughts are contained rather than allowed to grow. I like that it makes room for the Dynamic feature by providing a 'wild card' element. This allows an individual (or a society or any other group I guess) to step outside the framework & re-evaluate or re-assess or re-whatever & make changes to the framework. Maybe knowingly, maybe not. He cites examples in the book about these things. There are other examples you can find when you frame the 'thing' within this arrangement. Allowing for the Dynamic (vs the static) provides the tools needed to break out of it, if desired.\n \n Conversely, this system doesn't require you to define the Dynamic value. It exists is all. To demand the ineffable become 'effable' (is that even a word?) just doesn't make much sense to me. It seems to restrict rather than liberate. Or is like attempting to define randomness mathematically, the more you try, the less random it becomes. Maybe that's why there's a certain kind of power that comes with the naming or classification of things? \n \n Pirsig speaks about the platypus. When the platypus was first discovered, a system for the classification of animals was already in place. People were so used to this system (& maybe imprisoned by it just a bit?) they thought the platypus was some kinda miracle or a hoax of some sort? They did this rather than looking at the system in place which didn't account for that type of animal (& perhaps re-evaluating).\n \n I'm not suggesting the system (or whatever) always needs to be changed. If something works, why change it? But when a system isn't working, why not change it?\n \n Anyway, again best wishes & you might want to take a look at this book, he also wrote Zen & the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance & had his problems with rigid 'stuffy and opinionated' academics & others too.",

   "About the problems with evolution that you state. But first, you say:\n \npeople confuse my book for one about Intelligent Design.\n\n Understandable. Wikipedia says in regard to Haldane's Dilemma, \"Creationists, and proponents of intelligent design in particular, claim it remains unresolved and a source of controversy in the evolutionary genetics literature. Today, Haldane's Dilemma is raised mostly by creationists opposed to evolution, who claim it is evidence against large-scale evolution, and a supposed example of negligence on the part of the scientific community.\" It seems that you are being labeled by the company you keep.\n \nthe huge 50% cost of sexual reproduction,\n\n So it might seem at first glance. You would think that asexually reproducing organisms would out-compete those that reproduce sexually. But studies have shown that this is not the case. Research has shown that sexual reproduction is a method to shed parasites. This enables sexually reproducing organisms to escape the Red Queen hypothesis. (See: Evolution: The Triumph of an Idea by Carl Zimmer. pp 230-233 for a short discussion.) Moreover, sexual reproduction introduces increased genetic diversity to a population.\n \nthe fatal genetic load/Haldane's dilemma problem,\n\n Even Haldane assumed that an answer would be found. He was right. The dilemma is based on several false assumptions. Turns out it isn't a problem.\n \nthe difficulty of accounting for altruism,\n\n That too has been studied and accounted for.\n \nthe problems of determining the correct \"level\" or \"unit\" of selection etc).\n\n But that is a problem of human perception - it's not a problem for natural selection.\n \nScientists have put up with these flaws because we have had no other choice.\n\n Nope. The other choice is to study and to learn why. It has been done. Your problems are not really problems.\n \nThe reason people should listen to me is simple - the theoretical structure I provide removes all the problems that plague the Darwinian framework. It is more, not less, scientific (e.g. Darwin's theory is unavoidably, and unacceptably teleological).\n\n But \"Darwin's theory\" (he really stated 5 independent theories of evolution) doesn't come close to encompassing the entirety of evolutionary theory. We have learned much in 150 years, and still, Darwin's foundation has been tested and found to be correct.\n \n While your education in science is impressive, you still seem lacking in evolutionary biology. You didn't mention how you went about testing your hypotheses so that you can call them theories. Offering untested alternative explanations to tested theories does not mean that you can call them theories. Your hypotheses have to be extensively tested.",
