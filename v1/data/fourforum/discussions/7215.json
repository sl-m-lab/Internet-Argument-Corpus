   "On the \"small\" scale, there are deviations from Hubble's Law like how the Andromeda galaxy is moving towards us. Massive steller anomalies like the great attractor, clusters of galaxies and others create small deviations from Hubble's law. On the \"large\" side, the scale of superclusters, Hubble's Law is pretty accurate.",

   "I've read that Hubble's Law says that all the galaxies in the Universe are moving away from each other from a shared starting point.\nNot exactly. Hubble's Law states that the dominant motion of the universe is smooth expansion.\n \nElsewhere, I find that Andromeda galaxy is heading towards us and others are heading towards each other. Which is right or has Andromeda changed direction in the last hundred years?\nThere also exists gravity in the universe which tends to pull things towards each other. Given the recession velocity of galaxies, it is evident that they are also subject to other motions and that some are bound together, i.e., they seem to be orbiting each other as they move through space. cs-comm has already mentioned the Great Attractor which seems to impose a streaming motion on galaxies around us towards the constellation Centaurus. Also mentioned was the local group of galaxies of which our own Milky Way and Andromeda are a part. Besides motion towards each other, the local group is also moving towards the constellation Virgo.",
