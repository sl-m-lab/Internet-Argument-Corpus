   "Biblical scholars recognize at least four different oral traditions that were joined in the Pentateuch. For example, at a superficial level the Yahwist tradition prefers the name Yahweh, while the Elohist tradition prefers the more generic and plural name Elohim. There is also the Priestly tradition which produced the creation story of Gen 1, while Gen 2 is Yahwist. The Priestly influence can also be seen in the story of Noah where there is some confusion as to whether there are two of every \"kind,\" or whether 7 of the clean \"kinds\" were brought on board. It isn't clear whether it means 7 pairs or just 7. At any rate, the story of Noah is an intermixing of two oral traditions. The fourth tradition is the Deuteronomic tradition, which becomes apparent later in the Pentateuch.\n \n The point is that the two creation stories in Genesis came from different sources. Many scholars feel that they came from creation stories from ancient Sumer and the more recent Babylonian civilzation, both influential and mentioned in the Bible. The story of Noah was probably derived from the Sumerian epic of Gilgamesh.\n \n All in all, the stories are quite allegorical. It seems incredible that anyone could read the first two chapters of Genesis and conclude that they tell the same story, since they are contradictory beyond reconcilliation. Those who maintain that they are essentially the same story are afraid to read critically since to do so would challenge blind faith.\n \n Of course, Duo_Maxwell is correct. Whether allegorical or not, the Bible contradicts reality frequently. But it is our reality that is contradicted. To an unobservant, bronze age nomadic herdsman a grasshopper seemed to have 4 legs - they were a hated plague as well as a food source. Coneys (rabbits, hares) moved their mouth as if they were chewing cud - they are actually coprophagists eating their own first pass feces - definitely not cud. And bats are not fowl, even thought they fly.\n \n But the Bible isn't a scientific treatise. It is a collection of many oral traditions of a nomadic people.",

Is it not possible that the point of the opening post is (as Jim's Trucking suggested) that there are allegories in the bible? Period?\nYou are exactly correct in regard to my intent. IMHO, the allegories of the Bible are meant to teach the spirit of the stories, not actual facts...just as Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny are meant to represent the spirit of the seasons. When we are young children, we tend to believe in Santa and Thumper because our parents play the game so well, then as we learn the truth, we put away the belief that they are real but we pass the spirit on to our own children by playing the same game with them.\n \n AIMHO, God teaches us the spirit of creation with the inspired allegories written in the Bible. God created it all, He just did it in a fashion we will likely never fully understand.\n \n AIMHO, there were thousands of Adams and Eves, created after an evolutionary process that started when God created all matter and time.\n \n I'm not trying to warp the Bible at all, just as I would not try to warp the meaning of Santa Claus, even though I know he's not a jolly fat man living at the North Pole surrounded by elves and flying reindeer.",
