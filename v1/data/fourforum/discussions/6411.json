So I'll bring it up :) \n \n Do you think Dumbledore is really dead or not? Why or why not?\n \n And a related question: Whose side do you think Snape is really on? Why?\n \n I have my own thoughts on these matters, but I'll just chime in after people start talking about it.",

It's not the Inquisition here, I'm just curious as to what you're thinking.\n \n \nHowever JK has killed off a lot of good people all the important people in Harry's life.

I don't think Harry will die though. Particularly since it is geared towards kids.",

He freezes Harry just when harry would be of the most use to him. I can't believe a wizard as powerfull as dumbledore couldn't just mentally and silently do the spell to retrieve his wand. Harry and his class mates are being taught the skill as 6th years. Harry makes a comment that Dumbledore is somewhat talented at this nonverbal spell casting. So if Snape confessed to Dumbledore what Malfoys plans where and the fact that he, Snape, made an unbreakable vow then I think that Dumbledore may have taken precautions, much as Harrys mother did against the same spell when it was cast against Harry. Maybe not the same way but there may have been some ancient protection against the spell or Snape made his own version of the spell, as in Harrys potions book caontained many of Snapes own spells.\n He continues to ignore Harry's instincts about Malfoy, when Harry is right all along in the end. Dumbledore says over and over that he trusts Snape. I can't believe that a wizard as wise, powerfull, and full of intrigue as Dumbeldore would fall so easily. Dumbledore's always seems to have plans within plans.",

I think he froze Harry so that Harry could see his conversation with Malfoy, to maybe clue him in that he was going to fake his death. I'm not sure what you mean though by the precautions Lily took. Dumbledore ignores Harry's warnings about Draco because he already knows what Malfoy's plans are.\n \n Anyone else have something to add, or is thinking differently than the two of us here?",
