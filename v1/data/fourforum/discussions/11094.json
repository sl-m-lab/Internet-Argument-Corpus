   "Should athletes from around the World be expected to risk sacrificing their long term health in order to participate in that International historically relevant Sporting Event? Numerous Countries are questioning the wisdom of subjecting their finest athletes to the assault on their lungs that competing in the most polluted city on Earth will surely subject them to. \n \n Food and transportation issues for the athletes are another very real concern being considered which begs the question; what were they thinking when they chose China, and Beijing specifically to host the Olympics when potentially so many athletes from so many different Countries will be impacted in such a negative way?\n \n http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2005/oct/31/china.pollution\n As it gears up to host the 2008 Olympic Games Beijing has been awarded an unwelcome new accolade: the air pollution capital of the world.\n \n Satellite data has revealed that the city is one of the worst environmental victims of China's spectacular economic growth, which has brought with it air pollution levels that are blamed for more than 400,000 premature deaths a year.\n \n According to the European Space Agency, Beijing and its neighbouring north-east Chinese provinces have the planet's worst levels of nitrogen dioxide, which can cause fatal damage to the lungs.\n \n An explosive increase in car ownership is blamed for a sharp rise in unhealthy emissions. In the past five years the number of vehicles clogging the capital's streets has more than doubled to nearly 2.5m. It is expected to top the 3m mark by the start of the Olympics in 2008.\n \n Alarm about the perilous state of the environment has gathered pace in recent years. China is the world's second-largest producer of greenhouse gases, and the World Bank has warned it is home to 16 of the planet's 20 most air-polluted cities.\n \n According to the European satellite data, pollutants in the sky over China have increased by about 50% during the past 10 years. Senior officials warn that worse is still to come. At a recent seminar Zhang Lijun, deputy director of the environmental protection agency, said that pollution levels could more than quadruple within 15 years unless the country can slow the rise in energy consumption and automobile use.\n =======================================================================================================Smogging the Competition: Polluted Air and Athletes\n \n The Olympic venue known as the Bird's Nest is shrouded in smog as construction workers work in the foreground.\n \n AP Photo/Oded Balilty\n By Gale Bernhardt \n For Active.com\n \n Recently, Haile Gebrselassie, world record holder in the marathon, announced he is leaning toward pulling out of the marathon for the Olympic Games this August in Beijing due to the city's air pollution problem. While there is a chance he will compete in the 10,000 meter race, the threat of one of distance running's biggest names being absent from the marathon has brought international attention to the issues of air pollution, asthmatic athletes and endurance athletes.\n \n There are rumors of other asthmatic athletes that are considering skipping the Beijing Games due to the high levels of pollution.\n http://www.active.com/triathlon/Articles/Smogging_the_Competition__Polluted_Air_and_Athletes.htm?act=EMC-eNews_Tri_03082&Link=3",

   "Unfortunately, it is China&#8217;s contribution to transboundary air pollution that makes their problem the rest of the Worlds problem also. Just as important as the long term health impact her localized Air Pollution will have on the International Athletes during their stay in the Country, are the long term atmospheric and biological health impact on vegetation, animal life, human beings, and even how it will effect the O-zone around the World. But the question still remains as to why the International Olympic Committee would even consider choosing the most polluted Country and City on Earth to hold the games in. How could they disregard the health implications facing the athletes with such an irresponsible decision? Isn't their primary concern for the safety and security of the athletes? Or has it become all about money like everything else in this World is today?\n \n http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geu8nh9.tHU1YAHjlXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTByamlqaW9mBHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDMwRjb2xvA2FjMgR2dGlkAw--/SIG=11vunfduj/EXP=1206733153/**http%3a//china.usc.edu/App_Images/Economy.pdf\n The rise of China as an economic power is one of the great stories of the latter \n half of the 20th century. Twenty-five years of reform have produced staggering results: \n hundreds of millions of Chinese have been lifted out of poverty, China&#8217;s economy \n continues to grow at a rate of 8-12% annually, and the country currently ranks as the \n fourth largest economy and third largest exporting nation in the world, after the United \n States and Germany. \n \n At the same time, this growth has occurred without much consideration for the \n country&#8217;s environment. Building upon centuries of environmental degradation and \n pollution, the very rapid industrialization of the last quarter century has contributed to \n some of the highest rates of air and water pollution in the world, severe land degradation, \n and a range of emerging resource challenges. \n \n For the rest of the world, China&#8217;s environmental practices are increasingly setting \n off alarm bells. China is now one of the largest contributors to virtually every global \n environmental challenge: climate change, the illegal timber trade, and marine pollution \n among them. Moreover, even as the world marvels at China&#8217;s dizzying growth rates, the \n environment is impinging on future growth, harming the health of the Chinese people, \n and contributing to serious social unrest, all of which threaten to send China&#8217;s growth \n trajectory off track. \n \n There are some signs of hope. China&#8217;s leaders have significantly ramped up the \n attention they are devoting to the environment, and levels of investment in environmental \n protection have increased steadily. Beijing has also begun to experiment with new policy \n approaches designed to take advantage of its evolution toward a market economy and its \n growing integration with the world economy. \n \n To date, however, China&#8217;s leaders have been unable or unwilling to take the \n necessary political and economic steps to reverse the overall negative trends they are \n confronting in environmental degradation and pollution. China&#8217;s economic, social and \n political welfare&#8212;and to a large extent that of the world&#8212;over the next decade will all be shaped by how effectively the country&#8217;s leaders and the people integrate environmental protection with economic development. \n \n For the United States, the environmental challenge China presents is a politically \n complicated one. Over all, both American and Chinese leaders consistently stress the \n environment an arena of potential fruitful collaboration between China and the United \n States, and enthusiasm generally abounds&#8212;at least rhetorically&#8212;for identifying new \n cooperative ventures. \n \n At times, however, the political temperature in Washington rises, and the \n environment becomes a source of contention in the dialogue about China. Serious \n concerns over China&#8217;s contribution to transboundary air pollution, which carries mercury \n and other contaminants to U.S. land, as well as China&#8217;s significant contribution to global \n climate change top the list of U.S. policymakers&#8217; concerns.  \n ",

Here's some background to help you to understand the process we went through in responding to the problems decades before any other Countries on Earth.\n \n And as for your claim that we are no longer Manufacturing here which explains our low output; you just prove how little you actually understand, or relate to the size and power of this Nation. Even though we have admittedly outsourced much of the Manufacturing that was produced here just 20 years ago, we still manufacture more products here today that probably 80% of the rest of the World. Only Countries like China, Japan, Korea, India and maybe a few others out manufacture us. So don't be so quick to marginalize us as an epicenter of manufacturing because we still matter on that front.

Xinhua said 200,000 people were without water.\n \n Tests showed the polluted waters contained elevated levels of ammonia, nitrogen, and permanganate, a chemical used in metal cleaning, tanning and bleaching, Xinhua said. The pollution apparently flowed down from the Han River, the Hubei government said without elaborating on its source.\n \n Water from nearby Lake Chang was being diverted to dilute the pollution.\n \n Chronic pollution, chemical accidents\n Most of China's canals, rivers and lakes are severely tainted by industrial, agricultural and household pollution. Chinese leaders say the country faces a critical water shortage, partly due to chronic pollution and chemical accidents.\n \n In one of China's worst cases of river pollution, potentially cancer-causing chemicals, including benzene, spilled into the Songhua River in November 2005. The northeastern city of Harbin was forced to sever water supplies to 3.8 million people for five days. The accident also strained relations with Russia, into which the poisoned waters flowed.\n Do you see the numbers above for 120,000 and 200,000 people affected by the pollution? I don't believe those numbers for a minute. Especially knowing how china lies about everything, I believe millions of chinese people feed off of and dump into those rivers which is why the problem persists. \n \n We here in the West, because we can trust the stats our Governments give due to public accountability, think all Governments are like this. But China is under no such constraints or allusions that telling the truth is something they feel obligated to do, ever.",

It's their decision at the end of the day.\n\n \n Welcome to the forum c or d, but check this article out for an update of how absolutely dire the situation is in China today. http://www.impactlab.com/2006/06/12/the-worlds-top-20-most-polluted-cities/ Here are some excerpts from the link.\n A total of 16 out of the top 20 most polluted cities are in China. #1 on the list is Linfen City in Shanxi Province, China. \"The whole city smells and is covered in smoke.\"\n \n But Beijing, where the Olympics are being held is one of those 16 cities. And then there's this:\n \n Plugging a cigarette into his mouth, He Shouming runs a nicotine-stained fingernail down a list of registered deaths in Shangba, dubbed \"cancer village\" by the locals. The Communist Party official in this cluster of tiny hamlets of 3,300 people in northern Guangdong province, he concludes that almost half the 11 deaths among his neighbours this year, and 14 of the 31 last year, were due to cancer.\n Mr He blames Dabaoshan, a nearby mineral mine owned by the Guangdong provincial government, and a host of smaller private mines for spewing toxic waste into the local rivers, raising lead levels to 44 times permitted rates. Walking around the village, the water in the streams is indeed an alarming rust-red. A rice farmer complains of itchy legs from the paddies, and his wife needs a new kettle each month because the water corrodes metal. \"Put a duck in this water and it would die in two days,\" declares Mr He.\n \n And this:\n \n In late July an environmental disaster occurred on the Huai river, one of China's seven big rivers. A 133km-long black and brown plume swept along the river killing millions of fish and devastating wildlife. According to Mr Pan, the catastrophe occurred because too much water had been taken from the river system, reducing its ability to clean itself. Others say that numerous factories dump untreated waste directly into the water.\n \n As for used water, with a national daily sewage rate of around 3.7 billion tonnes, China would need 10,000 waste-water treatment plants costing some $48 billion just to achieve a 50% treatment rate, according to Frost & Sullivan, a consultancy. SEPA found over 70% of the water in five of China's seven major river systems was unsuitable for human contact. As more people move into cities, the problem of household waste is becoming severe. Only 20% of China's 168m tonnes of solid waste per year is properly disposed of.\n The air is not much better. \"If I work in your Beijing, I would shorten my life at least five years,\" Zhu Rongji told city officials when he was prime minister in 1999. According to the World Bank, China has 16 of the world's 20 most polluted cities. Estimates suggest that 300,000 people a year die prematurely from respiratory diseases.\n The main reason is that around 70% of China's mushrooming energy needs are supplied by coal-fired power stations, compared with 50% in America. Combined with the still widespread use of coal burners to heat homes, China has the world's highest emissions of sulphur dioxide and a quarter of the country endures acid rain. In 2002, SEPA found that the air quality in almost two-thirds of 300 cities it tested failed World Health Organisation standards-yet emissions from rocketing car ownership are only just becoming an issue. Hopes that China will \"leapfrog\" the West with super-green cars are naive, since dirty fuel messes up clean engines and the high cost of new cars keeps old ones on the road. Sun Jian, the second-ranking official at Shanghai's environmental protection bureau, estimates that 70% of Shanghai's 1m cars do not even reach the oldest European emission standards.\n Farmland erosion and desertification resulted in Beijing being hit with 11 sandstorms in 2000, prompting Mr Zhu to wonder whether the advancing desert might force him to relocate the capital. A year later, the yellow dust clouds were so extensive that they raised complaints in South Korea and Japan and travelled as far as America. A partial logging ban and massive replanting appear to have reversed China's deforestation, but its grass and agricultural land continue to shrink.\n Adding it all up, the World Bank concludes that pollution is costing China an annual 8-12% of its $1.4 trillion GDP in direct damage, such as the impact on crops of acid rain, medical bills, lost work from illness, money spent on disaster relief following floods and the implied costs of resource depletion. With health costs escalating, that figure will increase, giving rise to some grim prognoses that growth itself will be undermined. \"Ignored for decades, even centuries, China's environmental problems have the potential to bring the country to its knees economically,\" argues Elizabeth Economy, author of \"The River Runs Black\", a new book on China's pollution.\n So I ask you, do you really believe that having people drive their cars on odd or even numbered days for a few months is going to dissipate such serious pollution that has been going on for decades? That is wishful thinking at best.",

   "\n Depends what you mean by \"breathable.\" Beijing isn't that bad. I've been there recently. To go from pretty crappy to okay isn't that difficult. It won't be Dalian, but we can't have everything. \n \n If the CCCP can cut air pollution emissions extremely low, I can easily see Beijing's air problem becoming acceptable. It's like not air pollution is water pollution. Give it enough time for the air currents to move the pollution away and it should be okay. The biggest problem the CCCP will have is keeping pollution emissions low leading up to the Olympics. If they can do that, it won't be a problem. \n \n You do understand that complete halting of emissions at the same time as air flow removes air pollution will result in clean air over a certain period of time?\n\n \n So you claim to have been there, yet you are ignorant to the reality of how serious the problem is child? And you believe that the jet stream can just blow the pollution out of Beijing with a 4 month program of allowing cars to run on odd or even days based on their plate numbers? How do you explain these facts then? And you actually think that they are completely halting the spewing of emissions into the atmosphere? How can that be if they are just rotating who can drive on certain days and they aren't completely shutting down the factories or coal burning plants?  \n Satellite data reveals Beijing as air pollution capital of world\n As it gears up to host the 2008 Olympic Games Beijing has been awarded an unwelcome new accolade: the air pollution capital of the world.\n \n Satellite data has revealed that the city is one of the worst environmental victims of China's spectacular economic growth, which has brought with it air pollution levels that are blamed for more than 400,000 premature deaths a year.\n \n According to the European Space Agency, Beijing and its neighbouring north-east Chinese provinces have the planet's worst levels of nitrogen dioxide, which can cause fatal damage to the lungs.\n \n An explosive increase in car ownership is blamed for a sharp rise in unhealthy emissions. In the past five years the number of vehicles clogging the capital's streets has more than doubled to nearly 2.5m. It is expected to top the 3m mark by the start of the Olympics in 2008.\n \n Alarm about the perilous state of the environment has gathered pace in recent years. China is the world's second-largest producer of greenhouse gases, and the World Bank has warned it is home to 16 of the planet's 20 most air-polluted cities.\n \n According to the European satellite data, pollutants in the sky over China have increased by about 50% during the past 10 years. Senior officials warn that worse is still to come. At a recent seminar Zhang Lijun, deputy director of the environmental protection agency, said that pollution levels could more than quadruple within 15 years unless the country can slow the rise in energy consumption and automobile use.\n http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2005/oct/31/china.pollution",

Since value-added tax rebates are related to local output increases, local governments in China have strong incentives to increase production (thereby increasing revenue transfers), but have little incentive to protect the environment.\n\n \n From your link, my friend: According to The Economist (2004), the World Bank estimates that direct damages from pollution (e.g., medical bills) are 8-12% of China&#8217;s annual GDP. The World Bank has identified 16 of the 20 most polluted cities in the world to be located in China. And, close to two-thirds of the 300 cities tested by China&#8217;s environmental protection agency failed to meet the air quality standards set by the World Health Organization. With negligent environmental protection, some areas have such high levels of toxins in the air and groundwater that cancer levels are 15 to 30 times higher than the national figure (see Lynch 2005). 1 Unsustainable environmental practices also pose increasing threats to China&#8217;s water, forests, biodiversity, and food and energy supplies. Since China is a huge country, its pollution problems undoubtedly have serious negative effects on the global environment.2\n \n \nI agree with this article, and you Angel, more needs to be done by the Chinese government. However, I do not think that getting it done in time for the Olympics is really the most crucial concern. Nor do I think that the government are taking the issue particularly lightly.\n\n \n Getting the air clean enough not to permanently damage the Olympic Athletes is the subject of this thread though. I agree that the long term issue that will effect the health of the billions of chinese citizens is paramount long term, but this thread was started to discuss the issue with the Olympics, and how a short term fix is impossible.\n \n \nWe can only hope that having the Olympics hosted in Beijing and the global pressure that it's creating will encourage more legislation and stricter punishments for those offending businesses in order to improve the situation.\n\n \n Agreed, but if a sense of survival for its own citizens hasn't motivated China to use just 1% of their manufacturing profits to install scrubber technology that the US and Japan invented back in the 70s, and properly dispose of toxic waste to protect against ground and water pollution, then what makes you think the Olympics will do it? If you actually read the links I posted since we have been discussing this, you couldn't help but be alarmed at their purposeful environmental irresponsibility in favor of profits. You also must understand that the chinese communist government has no guilt pangs when its citizens die from cancer and lung infections. Where is their motivation to be responsible if they're not even concerned for the health of their citizens?",

You actually consider what this article say's making an effort? I'm quoting the whole piece, please note emphasis on the bolded.\n China will clean up air by shutting down plants\n \n July 6, 2008\n \n BEIJING - With Beijing struggling to clear polluted skies before the Olympics next month, the nearby industrial port of Tianjin has ordered 40 factories to suspend some operations at the end of the month as part of an effort to improve air quality during the games and the Paralympics competition that follows, state news media reported.\n \n The planned shutdowns in Tianjin, about 70 miles east of Beijing, are one piece of a regional plan that is expected to result in temporary factory closings or slowdowns across a large part of northern China.\n \n Beijing's air quality remains a major concern for the games as the city continues to struggle with pollution, despite a $20 billion government cleanup campaign. Beijing is also a victim of its neighborhood: Pollution blows in from surrounding regions that are dotted with coal mines, steel mills, cement factories and other heavy industry.\n \n The Olympics' opening ceremony is Aug. 8, and meteorologists have said factories must begin closing a few weeks beforehand. The shutdowns in Tianjin will be from July 25 to Sept. 30, after the end of the Paralympics, according to the state-run news agency Xinhua. Tianjin is a host city for the Olympic soccer competition.\n So the Olympics start on Aug 8, but the shutdowns start on July 25. Only 2 weeks before. And you think that is as you say, the \"duration\"? With thousands of tons of heavy metals, cancer causing particulates and CFCs in the atmosphere, does anyone really think that they will dissipate in 2 weeks? \n \n Here's another link, and notice the photo of Beijing in APRIL, just 5 months before the start of the Olympics. http://www.voanews.com/english/2006-06-28-voa36.cfm\n \n Regarding the top two polluting cities on Earth, One of which your article mentions, here's the lowdown on them.\n \n 1) Linfen, China\n \n Smog covers the city center of Linfen. Reinhard Krause / Reuters\n \n Number of people potentially affected: 3,000,000 Type of pollutant: Coal and particulates Source of pollution: Automobile and industrial emissions\n \n This soot-blackened city in China's inland Shanxi province makes Dickensian London look as pristine as a nature park. Shanxi is the heart of China's coal belt, and the hills around Linfen are dotted with mines, legal and illegal, and the air is filled with burning coal. Don't bother hanging your laundry &#8212; it'll turn black before it dries. China's State Environmental Protection Agency says that Linfen has the worst air in the country, which is saying something, considering that the World Bank has reported that 16 of the 20 most polluted cities in the world are Chinese. One Linfen native summed up the city's plight to a TIME reporter last year: \"This place of ours is no good.\"\n \n 2) Tianjin, China\n \n Tianjin, China Daniel H. Abbott\n \n Number of people potentially affected: 140,000 Type of pollutant: Lead and other heavy metals Source of pollution: Mining and processing\n \n An industrial city &#8212; though China doesn't really have any other kind &#8212;in the country's northeastern rust belt, Tianjin accounts for over half of China's lead production. Thanks to poor technology and worse regulation, much of that toxic metal ends up in Tianjin's soil and water, and then in the bloodstream of its children, where it can cause lowered IQ. Wheat has been found to contain lead levels up to 24 times Chinese standards, which are even more stringent that U.S. restrictions on lead. \"China has a commitment to environmental protection, but it also has a commitment to industry,\" says Fuller. \"It's a constant push that's mostly won by industry.\"\n http://www.mindfully.org/Heritage/2007/Polluted-Places-Earth12sep07.htm\n \n Here's a map of China that shows Tianjin in relation to Beijing. http://www.drben.net/ChinaReport/Beijing/MapsofBeijing/Beijing_Region_Maps/Beijing_TangShan_Tianjin_ShiJiaZhuang-1B.html",

I am going on record and predicting that athletes will suffer permanent lung damage due to the quality of air in China.

July 8, 2008 (left). Workers rush an Olympic exhibition scaffolding project as Beijing's smog hangs overhead, July 8, 2008 (right). The government needs to meet its pledge to deliver clean air in one of the world's most polluted cities, and must finish two new subway lines and a railway line.\n \n Beijing's gray-tinted air is expected to begin clearing this month as strict, two-month pollution controls come into force July 20. Factories and heavy industry in several provinces around Beijing will be shuttered, and up to 2 million vehicles will be taken off the roads using an even-odd plate registration system.\n \n In Qingdao, the venue for sailing 350 miles from Beijing, thousands are working to clear an algae bloom that covers one third of the sea area where the competition begins Aug. 9. The bloom may be caused by pollution, a persistent problem along the highly industrialized east coast of China.\n \n \n Rogge, the IOC president has said some outdoor endurance events lasting more than an hour will be postponed if the air quality is poor. He has yet to comment publicly on the water quality in Qingdao.\n http://abcnews.go.com/Travel/BusinessTravel/wireStory?id=5329984",

   "It's the overall picture of what is happening in China that is so disturbing. To look at the very limited solutions being bandied about is to play ostrich to a charging tiger. Here's what I mean.\n \n Air, Land, River Pollution and Social Unrest in ChinaBEIJING - A pale orange sun hangs low over the evening rush hour, a brake-light procession of Mercedes, matchbox-size taxis and accordion-style buses that cuts through a canyon of skyscraper construction cranes.\n \n On this spring evening, as on most days, this city of 15 million souls is wrapped in a churning brown gauze of foul fumes and gritty dirt.\n \n \"It's a pretty strong cocktail of dust particulates, industrial and automotive pollution,\" observed Jeremy Goldkorn, a 12-year Beijing resident and Internet entrepreneur. \"It's something a lot of expatriates, especially people from Northern California, find very difficult. You blow your nose and what comes out is black.\"\n \n For China, the 21st century holds boundless possibilities. The awakening economic giant could surpass anything that has come before it. But China is also an environmental time bomb.\n \n Its polluted air is not only choking its citizens but also spreading 6,000 miles across the Pacific, giving Californians - even those with no other ties to China - a personal stake in that country's exploding environmental crisis.\n \n Microscopic soot particles belched from coal-fired plants across the ocean are settling in Sierra Nevada snowpacks. Low levels of mercury from those plants are showing up in soil and water. And dust from expanding deserts in China and elsewhere in Asia can be found in the air high above the state.\n \n Pollution migration is not new - Europeans, for example, get it from the United States. And the current levels of pollutants from Asia do not pose an urgent health or environmental threat. But experts worry about the potential increase of emissions from China as the world's fastest-growing economy continues to expand. At the very least, pollution from China will add to the cost and difficulty of cleaning up California's skies.\n \n For decades, the United States has been the world's largest polluter, taken to task by other countries for its contribution to global warming. This year, however, China's annual emissions are on pace to overtake those of the United States. Worse, China's pollution is projected to be double that of all other industrialized nations combined in 25 years, according to the International Energy Agency.\n \n \"The concern about China is that it is going through such a rapid industrialization,\" said V. Ramanathan, a scientist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego. \"It is setting up more coal-fired power plants. The number of cars are increasing.\"\n \n Hooked on coal: Plants and factories inadequately equipped\n \n Twenty of the world's 30 most polluted cities are in China, and every year more than 300,000 deaths there are attributed to pollution, according to the World Bank.\n \n Much of that pollution comes from the coal-fired plants that produce about 70 percent of China's energy needs, compared with 50 percent for the United States and 16 percent for California.\n \n But the problem in China is not just the amount of coal burned. Many of its plants and factories have inadequate pollution-control equipment, if any, and that is unlikely to change in coming years. Rising levels of sulfur dioxide from burning coal is causing acid rain.\n \n Foul air is just one ingredient in the toxic stew that is China's environment. Seventy percent of the country's lakes and rivers are so polluted they would make humans sick. Every year, about 45 billion tons of industrial waste and raw sewage are dumped in rivers and lakes.\n \n In late 2005, a chemical plant spill contaminated the Songhua River in northern China, forcing the city of Harbin to shut down its drinking water system. Earlier this month, more than a million residents of eastern China were left without drinking water when a fast-spreading, putrid-smelling green algae covered badly polluted Lake Tai.\n \n The northern half of China is \"drying out\" as water tables fall, lakes vanish and rivers disappear, observed environmental analyst Lester Brown, founder of Washington-based Earth Policy Institute. Much of the water in the southern half of China, meanwhile, is growing ever more polluted.\n \n The land also suffers.\n \n The government recently reported that 10 percent of farmland has been destroyed by pollution and that heavy metals contaminate 12 million tons of grain a year. Toxic food scares have become common in China, and increasingly are a worry in the United States as food imports from China grow.\n \n Rampant deforestation is expanding the country's deserts and contributing to disruptive spring sandstorms so big they have shown up on NASA satellite photos as giant blobs of brown passing over Asia and California. About 27 percent of China's land mass is now desert, or becoming desert.\n \n The Gobi Desert in northern China expanded more than 20,000 square miles, about half the size of Pennsylvania, in just six years in the 1990s, Brown noted.\n \n China also has become the electronic-waste garbage dump for the world. A recent report by the Beijing-based Science and Technology Daily, the official newspaper of the Ministry of Science and Technology, said most of the home electronics gadgets discarded by the developed world end up in China.\n \n \"The question of the century is: Can China industrialize in a way that does not crush the planet?\" said Erik Straser, general partner in MDV-Mohr Davidow Ventures of Menlo Park and an expert in energy company investments who has consulted with Chinese officials.\n \n China's leaders finally have begun to wake up to the toll from the country's environmental problems. The State Environmental Protection Administration and the National Bureau of Statistics estimated that environmental degradation, pollution-related health problems and lost work days in 2004 came with a $64 billion price tag, or 3.05 percent of the country's $2 trillion gross domestic product that year. Some experts believe the cost is much higher.\n \n Earlier this month, with pressure building to put a green face on Beijing for the 2008 Olympics, China announced a strategy to grapple with global warming and pollution, though much of it reiterated earlier goals. The plan included tough measures to cut pollution and promote renewable energy. But the government rejected mandatory emissions caps as unfair to China and other developing countries struggling to combat poverty.\n \n \"The environment is very, very much an issue,\" said Lai Ming, general director of science and technology with the Ministry of Construction. \"If we don't deal with it now, it will definitely hurt the economy in the future.\"\n \n Fight against poverty: Balancing economic, environmental needs\n \n But the challenges are daunting. The nation of 1.3 billion people, most of whom live in poverty, must continue to stoke its economic engine while working to avoid environmental disaster.\n \n \"Over the last 20 years, people just focused on GDP, GDP,\" said Beijing-based Timothy Hui, chief China representative of the Natural Resources Defense Council, a U.S. environmental advocacy group. \"Now, China is looking at its economic growth and environment. But China has no experience at achieving this balance.\"\n \n Now, though, mounting evidence suggests China's pollution poses problems beyond its own borders.\n \n \"It's apparent there is a lot of pollution coming from Asia and that pollution is increasing,\" said Steven Cliff, an atmospheric scientist at the University of California-Davis, whose research has detected matter he believes comes from China.\n \n \"A persistent Asian plume is evident in the air over California,\" said Cliff, whose air-sampling equipment has been placed at Donner Summit, Lassen Peak and Mount Tamalpais. \"It looks vaguely smoky. Generally, you see the type of pollution you might expect from large urban areas in Asia, that might be from a diesel engine or a coal-fired power plant for a cement factory.\"\n \n Much of the year, Asian pollution - including soot, ash and dust from farms, factories and coal-fired power plants - hovers high above the Golden State and is, on average, equal to a quarter of the state's legally allowed concentrations of these particles, said Richard \"Tony\" VanCuren, a researcher with the California Air Resources Board.\n \n China's pollution drift is \"not an immediate major concern\" in terms of public health for the state's major cities, he said, because California's coastal areas are protected on most days by the so-called marine layer of air, which acts as a shield against pollution at higher altitudes. But VanCuren said the state is now closely tracking the pollution from Asia because \"it will drive up the cost of air pollution control.\"\n \n The snow-embedded pollution from China adds to damage already being caused by local pollution, said Ross Edwards, associate research professor at the Desert Research Institute in Reno. \"It absorbs sunlight from the atmosphere and melts the snow faster,\" he said. \"It impacts our ability to store water and contributes to global warming.\"\n \n Scripps scientist Ramanathan is embarking on a one-year state-funded study of the trans-Pacific pollution over the Golden State. Using unmanned aircraft and snowpack monitoring devices, he hopes to determine how much pollution is coming from China and what it is doing to local climates.\n \n 'The River Runs Black': Polluted water sparks protests and riots\n \n Although China's pollution may be a growing worry for other countries, the brunt of the harm falls on the Chinese.\n \n \"One hundred ninety-million Chinese are drinking water that is making them sick,\" observed Elizabeth Economy, director of Asia studies at the Council on Foreign Relations and the author of \"The River Runs Black: The Environmental Challenge to China's Future.\"\n \n Growing health concerns from environmental calamities, such as industrial waste dumped into rivers that provide drinking water to rural communities, have triggered thousands of riots and protests across the countryside.\n \n \"It could undermine our social stability,\" said Ma Jun, a Beijing-based environmental crusader who heads the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs. \"The pollution is way beyond our environmental capacity, and it's increasing,\" he added.\n \n Yet China's growing middle class - estimated to be about 125 million - wants the kind of lifestyle enjoyed by those in the car-loving West. That is evident on Beijing's wide streets and in auto dealerships that dot the city. China is now the world's second-largest market for automobiles, and the third-largest car producer.\n \n Every year, about 300,000 new vehicles hit Beijing's streets, adding to the nearly 3 million already crowding the city.\n http://chinaview.wordpress.com/2007/06/19/air-land-river-pollution-and-social-unrest-in-china/",

In marked contrast to the Athens Games of four years ago, preparations are already nearly complete for much of the Olympic infrastructure. At the Olympic sites, thousands of workers are putting the final coats of paint and tightening the nuts and bolts on what has been a \u00a320bn programme of urban renewal. The 31 venues for the Games are ready, and the new road system and subway network are on stream. \n \n \nYou alleged geniuses don't have the brains to consider the effects of inversion or the heat index's impact on air quality because of the summertime temps.\n\n Inversion and 'the effects of heat' are pretty much the same thing - a bank of warm air ends up above the cooler bank of polluted air beolw it, effectively cutting off vertical particle transfer. However, this is unlikely to happen, and even if it did then it would not last for a huge length of time. Furthermore, heavy particles do not generally rise that high, they move out by sideways diffusion - something I was talking about it before.\n It's a shame that you feel the need to insult us to carry out what is quite an interesting conversation.

In America, this picture http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/worldnews/2485675/Beijing-Olympics-2008-air-quality-improves.html?image=2 \n would represent a National panic situation, yet in China, it's grade 1 conditions, or as they put it, good air quality. \n \n But anyway, how naive are you to believe that one rainstorm will actually permanently wash away uncountable tons of particulate toxic matter that took multiple decades to build up in the atmosphere? And do you think that the constant releases of fresh pollutants from neighboring Countries and from neighboring provinces within China that aren't shutting down wont be blown in on fresh winds? And have you considered the possible effect the weather will have on air quality?\n BEIJING (Map, News) - The Chinese capital was shrouded in thick gray smog on Sunday, just 12 days before the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympic Games. One expert warned that drastic measures enacted to cut vehicle and factory emissions in the city were no guarantee skies would be clear during competitions.\n \n The pollution was among the worst seen in Beijing in the past month, despite traffic restrictions enacted a week ago that removed half of the city's vehicles from roadways.\n \n Visibility was a half mile in some places. During the opening ceremony of the Athletes' Village on Sunday, the housing complex was invisible from the nearby main Olympic Green.\n \n \"No, it doesn't really look so good, but as I said, yesterday was better,\" said Gunilla Lindberg, an International Olympic Committee vice president from Sweden who is staying in the Athletes' Village. \"The day I arrived, Tuesday, was awful.\"\n \n \"We try to be hopeful. Hopefully we are lucky during the games as we were with Atlanta, Athens and Barcelona,\" she added.\n \n The city's notoriously polluted air is one of the biggest questions hanging over the games, which begin on Aug. 8. On Sunday, temperatures of about 90 degrees, with 70 percent humidity and low winds, created a soupy mix of harmful chemicals, particulate matter and water vapor.\n \n Athletes have been trickling into Beijing and were expected to begin arriving in large numbers this week - though some were headed to South Korea, Japan and other places to avoid Beijing's air for as long as possible. Some Olympic delegations, including the U.S. Olympic Committee, are making protective masks available to their athletes.\n \n The Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau said Sunday's air was \"unhealthy for sensitive groups.\"\n \n The Chinese leadership consider the Beijing Olympics a matter of national prestige, and efforts to clean up the environment were part of its meticulous preparations for an event it hopes will dazzle the world. Choking air pollution and visitors shocked at the environmental conditions would be an embarrassment for a government that wants to show itself is a modern nation.http://www.examiner.com/a-1507684~Air_pollution_still_an_issue_in_Beijing.html\n \n \n Here's a great link that discusses the effect the weather conditions can have on the pollution levels, with an excerpt. \n The aim is to reduce air pollution so when athletes and tourists arrive for the Olympics, they can see blue sky above the bird's nest stadium. They also want competitors concerned over health risks to rest easy.\n But the BBC's James Reynolds has been monitoring air quality in Beijing since the measures came into force and the results are not good. A measurement of PM10 (particles smaller than 10 micrometres) shows things got worse - at a given snapshot moment each day - for five successive days after the introduction of the measures.\n Despite lower emissions, levels of pollution are still bad. The authorities are even talking about more severe \"ultra-emergency\" measures immediately prior to key events, with 90% of cars off the roads and much industry shut down.\n \n Whether the weather\n It is possible to tackle air pollution in the short term, says Hugh Coe, professor of atmospheric composition at Manchester University.\n \n \"It isn't like climate change where you put carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and it lasts for decades. Air quality is a short term problem. If you stop emitting, your air quality could improve very quickly.\"\n But it's not quite as simple as just turning off the pollution tap, says Prof Coe.\n \"It's about the rate at which you pump this stuff into the atmosphere and the meteorological conditions. There is not too much you can do about the latter.\"\n The weather is the great variable in any efforts to clear the air.\n Frank Kelly, professor of environmental health at King's College London, says the worst case scenario is \"very, very low winds, high atmospheric pressure, an anti-cyclone building up above the city - it acts like a saucepan with the lid on\".\n Pollution needs to be able to rise into the atmosphere and blown by winds to properly disperse.\n The worst case scenario is a situation like London's Great Smog of December 1952. Then there was almost certainly increased coal burning because of the cold weather, but the main culprit was a rather nasty weather pattern, known as an inversion layer.\n Normally the air gets colder the higher you go. In an inversion layer, this is reversed with a layer of cold air held in place by a warmer \"lid\". The result in 1952 was a city choked with smog and at least 4,000 extra deaths.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7532603.stm",

THE NERVE IT TAKES TO OFFER NOTHING WHILE CLAIMING VICTORY JUST REVEALS WHAT YOU'RE MADE OF, AND WHY YOU DON'T BELONG ON A DEBATE FORUM WITH ADULTS. YOUR GOAL ISN'T TO DEBATE, BUT TO INFURIATE. AND PLEASE REPORT THIS POST SO ADMIN CAN SEE HOW TROLLISH AND LAME YOUR DEBATING STYLE IS!!!\n \n I'll wait for the games to take place so we can see what happens in reality. And I will pray for a good outcome and that no negative health problems impact either the games or the athletes. But those endurance sports are at great risk and that was the reason for this thread. It wasn't started to condemn china, but to expose their environmental irresponsibility, and the IOCs irresponsibility in allowing one of the most polluted Countries on Earth to host the games.",

   "But anyway, how naive are you to believe that one rainstorm will actually permanently wash away uncountable tons of particulate toxic matter that took multiple decades to build up in the atmosphere? And do you think that the constant releases of fresh pollutants from neighboring Countries and from neighboring provinces within China that aren't shutting down wont be blown in on fresh winds?\n\n I just had to comment on the above 2 questions as they appear to contradict each other.\n \n The first implies that particulate toxic matter can built up in the atmosphere over multiple decades. Admittedly this is true, but it does not build up in the atmosphere over one particular spot. The atmosphere moves. So particulates that were placed in the atmosphere decades ago (even months ago) are now spread around the globe. Does this mean that we can no longer hold the Olympics anywhere (and is it China's fault)?\n \n The second mentions this atmospheric movement, which makes me wonder about the first. So, pollution that comes from Beijing isn't just going to hang around (for multiple decades), and pollution from other cities will come into Beijing and then move on. Hopefully the local authorities have studied the weather patterns and made changes within Beijing and the areas 'upstream'. They're a fairly smart bunch, so . . . . \n \n But as was shown by this 'one rainstorm' that was mentioned, the atmosphere (and the pollution therein) is very changeable, and very quickly changeable. After this rainstorm pollutants in the air dropped to around 20% of their previous level.\n \n So, the Beijing authorities have reduced the traffic on the roads by about 30%, factories have been relocated, the city's subway has been improved, and it is believed that around a third of Beijing residents are going on holiday during the Olympics.\n \n China is a developing country, so these changes are going to be hard on them, but hopefully the Olympics will be a success and the new cleaner Beijing wil be an example to other cities throughout the country.\n \n If there are any athletes coming from places like Los Angeles, London, New York and other such polluted cities, let's hope they find the clean air a nice change.\n \n Smiley",

   "Here's the problem in dealing with a closed and secretive dictatorial Society like China. They will lie about, and manipulate the facts at every turn in order to make any situation appear to be better than it is in reality. That is why your claimed 80% improvement after one rainstorm seems not only unbelievable, but incredible. Here is how the reporter on the scene explain it. This excerpt is from the second half of the article:\n A 'Disinformation Campaign'\n \n A propaganda battle is being fought over pollution measurements. Reporters stand in front of the Olympic Stadium with measuring instruments and tell the world that every breath drawn here will make you sick. Wang and his people are doing everything they can to counteract this impression.\n \n AFP\n Chinese soldiers remove algae from near the Olympic Sailing Centre at Qingdao.\n \n A total of 27 monitoring stations were set up to supply air quality data for the Olympic Games host city. And recently the message has mostly been that everything is just fine. However, an American scientist, Steven Andrews, noticed that two monitoring stations were removed from locations where there is a high volume of traffic and three new ones were set up at locations where pollution levels are lower.\n Andrews also found out that the pollution standards were secretly lowered, that changes were made with regard to substances being measured, and that some substances, such as ozone, were simply not measured at all. Andrews spoke of a disinformation campaign. He says there is every reason to believe that Beijing's effort to ensure that the Olympic Games will be \"green\" is headed for failure. In his view, all that China has succeeded in doing thus far is to find clever ways of covering up its inability to reduce pollution levels.\n \n The athletes, whose performances will hopefully make the Beijing Olympics a sports fest of superlatives, are perturbed by the situation. Many of them, including the German, British, and Swedish track-and-field teams, have chosen not to come to Beijing to prepare for the games and have gone to Japan or South Korea instead. \"We want to wait as long as possible before exposing ourselves to the pollution there,\" says German high jumper Eike Onnen. The Olympic teams from the Netherlands and Switzerland have gone to the coastal city of Dalian for precompetition training. Most teams plan to fly to Beijing shortly before the games begin.\n \n According to David Martin, exercise physiologist and respiratory expert for the US marathon team, breathing the air in Beijing could be compared to \"feeding an athlete poison.\" Ethiopian world record holder Haile Gebrselassie decided to withdraw from the marathon and will only be competing in the 10,000 meters. He suffers from asthma and was afraid that running the longer distance in the conditions that currently exist in Beijing could be harmful to his health. American boxing team physician Frank Filiberto accompanied 11 boxers to Beijing for a competition last November. On their first morning in the city his charges returned from a 20-minute run complaining of burning eyes and breathing problems: \"In my opinion boxers are probably the finest athletes in the world,\" Filiberto said. \"But they didn't think they could make it three rounds in Beijing.\"\n \n \n DER SPIEGEL\n The IOC has tried to play down the importance of the problem. After all, even Greenpeace finds China's environmental legislation \"progressive.\" IOC officials say that the marathon and triathlon could be postponed if air pollution levels are particularly high on the days the events are scheduled for.\n But then pictures suddenly emerged that couldn't be denied. A gigantic carpet of algae appeared in front of the city of Qingdao, right in the bay where the Olympic sailing events are scheduled to take place.\n \n Where the algae came from remains unknown. A random natural phenomenon? Or the result of the poor water quality in the region caused by pollutant discharges and excessive use of fertilizers over a period of decades?\n \n Thousands of soldiers and volunteers spent several days fishing tons of green algae out of the water and then built protective fences around the regatta course. Disaster seems to have been averted for the time being, but no one is certain a renewed algae bloom can be prevented.\n \n The problems facing Beijing's water supply have so far failed to attract much attention. Yet the city is drying out. More than two hundred rivers, streams, and canals are marked in blue on official maps. But when you go look for them what you often find is nothing but a dried-up bed where water used to be. This loss of natural waterways has affected the Shunyi District where the Olympic rowing and canoeing events are due to take place. The Chaobei River has been gone for many years now, with nothing but weeds and bushes growing in the dry riverbed.\n \n Nevertheless the regatta course is now filled with three and half meters of water. \"It's fresh and clean. We're pumping it up out of the ground,\" says an employee of a company the local waterworks has commissioned to do the job.\n \n The same method will ensure that a number of rivers and canals will be filled with water during the games. Environmentalists estimate that more than 200 million cubic meters of water will have to be pumped up out of ground to be able to stage these sports events. Chinese farmers who are having to pump water up out of deep wells to irrigate their fields are the ones who will have to pay the price for this extravagance. \"The games will inevitably exacerbate the water crisis,\" says environmentalist and regime critic Dai Qing.\n \n However, it would seem that the need to keep up appearances is more important to the government. A new set of weather statistics appeared several days ago, stating that there is a high probability that the weather is going to be drizzly on August 8, the day of the opening ceremony.\n \n Drizzly weather? That's unacceptable. The national weather service has made contingency plans to send up rockets filled with chemicals designed to dissipate rain clouds in the worst-case scenario. However, the ability of science to control the weather is limited. Meteorologist Chen Zhenlin concedes: \"When it starts to come down real hard there's just not a whole lot we can do about it.\"\n \n URL:\n http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,567578,00.html\n http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,567578-2,00.html",

I don't have to, nor do I want to rationalize anything or make any excuses for China's problems. They are attempting to manipulate the weather by starting the rain to wash the air and then stopping it for the games. It's a very extreme plan, but that is par for the course for red china.

Read it and weep...\n \n China to Force Rain Ahead of Olympics\n By The Associated Press\n posted: 25 April 2007 11:06 am ET\n Buzz up!\n 0 Comments | 0 Recommend\n BEIJING (AP) &#8212; Chance of showers during the 2008 Beijing Olympics: 50 percent. But Chinese meteorologists have a plan to bring sunshine.\n \n The meteorologists say they can force rain in the days before the Olympics, through a process known as cloud-seeding, to clean the air and ensure clear skies. China has been tinkering with artificial rainmaking for decades, but whether it works is a matter of debate among scientists.\n \n Weather patterns for the past 30 years indicate there is a 50 percent chance of rain for both the opening ceremony on Aug. 8, 2008 and the closing ceremony two weeks later, said Wang Yubin, an engineer with the Beijing Meteorological Bureau.\n \n The forced rain could also help clean Beijing's polluted air, said Wang Jianjie, another meteorologist with the bureau.\n \n &#8220;When conditions permit, we will artificially increase rainfall,'' she said. &#8220;Rainfall is a way to naturally clean the air.''\n \n In 2003, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences questioned the science behind cloud-seeding as &#8220;too weak.'' But China frequently uses artificial rainmaking in the drought-plagued north.\n \n Last May, Beijing boasted having generated rainfall to clear the air and streets following the worst dust storm in a decade.\n \n Technicians with the Beijing Weather Modification Office said they fired seven rocket shells containing 163 cigarette-size sticks of silver iodide over the city's skies. They claimed it provoked a chemical reaction in clouds that forced four-tenths of an inch of rain.\n \n Beijing's air pollution is among Asia's worst. Officials have shuttered several chemical and steel plants on the city's edge, and many polluters will shut down &#8212; or cut back &#8212; during the Olympics. But the city also has 2.9 million registered vehicles, and the number is expected to reach 3.3 million by the Olympics, a 13 percent increase.\n http://www.livescience.com/environment/070425_ap_china_rain.html\n \n But this is nothing new for China, she has a long history through dictators like Mao of attempting to control the world without considering the consequences of their actions. What I marvel at though, is that the rest of the so called informed world just sits by and allows them to experiment with our Planet. Here's an example of Mao's follies.\n \"The cadres' job was to stop the peasants 'stealing' their own harvest. Horrific punishments were widespread; some people were buried alive, others strangled with ropes, others had their noses cut off. In one village four terrorized young children were saved from being buried alive for taking some food only when the earth was at their waists, after a desperate plea from their parents. In another village, a child had four fingers chopped off for trying to steal a scrap of unripe food; in another, two children who tried to steal food had wires run through their ears, and were then hung up by the wire from a wall....\"\n \n People starved to death by the millions.\n \n One of the lessons we take from these stories is that the people who want to force their ideas on you, are always the same people whose ideas are idiotic. Mao had more than his share of them. He had peasants digging up the soil by hand, down to a depth of half a meter. Then, he figured that planting seeds closer could enhance crop yields...while actually reducing the amount of fertilizer applied. He had the whole country launched on a goofy program of making steel in backyard furnaces. And then, he decided that sparrows were eating too much of the nation's harvest...so he got the peasants to shoo away the birds and kill them. As the sparrows disappeared, along came the bugs and insects that they had kept under control, in such numbers that they soon threatened the entire harvest. Secretly, the Chinese government finally had to ask the Russians for aid: please send sparrows, in the name of socialist internationalism!\n \n Yes, there are funny parts to the Mao story. So eager were the Maoists to industrialize that they completely neglected quality control. Chinese planes couldn't fly. Tanks couldn't drive in a straight line (on one occasion, a Chinese made tank swerved around and charged at a group of VIPs, say the Mao authors). Chinese ships were more of a danger to their crews than to the enemy. And when a Chinese helicopter was presented to Ho Chi Minh, the manufacturers detained it at the border because they were afraid it might crash.http://www.lewrockwell.com/bonner/bonner304.html\n \n Kind of brings to mind the current lead found in the paint in the children's toys China is manufacturing, and the toxic chemicals being found in food stuff coming from there. And don't forget the tainted medicines.",

   "Here's more on China's love affair with controlling the weather.\n [I]In addition to making it rain or snow on command, China's weather modifiers are now taking on an even more ambitious task - preventing rainfall that might put a damper on this summer's Olympic Games in Beijing. A recent article in Technology Review describes their plan:\n \n \"To prevent rain over the roofless 91,000-seat Olympic stadium that Beijing natives have nicknamed the Bird's Nest, the city's branch of the national Weather Modification Office - itself a department of the larger China Meteorological Administration - has prepared a three-stage program for the 2008 Olympics this August.\n \n First, Beijing's Weather Modification Office will track the region's weather via satellites, planes, radar, and an IBM p575 supercomputer purchased from Big Blue last year, that executes 9.8 trillion floating point operations per second. It models an area of 44,000 square kilometers (17,000 square miles) accurately enough to generate hourly forecasts for each kilometer.\n \n Then, using their two aircraft and an array of twenty artillery and rocket-launch sites around Beijing, the city's weather engineers will shoot and spray silver iodide and dry ice into incoming clouds that are still far enough away that their rain can be flushed out before they reach the stadium.\n \n Finally, any rain-heavy clouds that near the Bird's Nest will be seeded with chemicals to shrink droplets so that rain won't fall until those clouds have passed over. Zhang Qian, head of Beijing's Weather Modification Office, explains, 'We use a coolant made from liquid nitrogen to increase the number of droplets while decreasing their average size. As a result, the smaller droplets are less likely to fall, and precipitation can be reduced.' August is part of Northeast Asia's rainy season; chances of precipitation over Beijing on any day that month will approach 50 percent. Still, while tests with clouds bearing heavy rain loads haven't always been successful, Qian claims that 'the results with light rain have been satisfactory.'\"\n \n Western scientists have expressed their doubts about whether any of this will actually work. A 2003 National Academy of Sciences report concluded that although seeding clearly caused changes in clouds, there was insufficient data to prove that attempts to manipulate the weather really are effective. \"There is no scientific literature available that can substantiate (Chinese) claims,\" Roelof Bruintjes, who leads the weather modification group at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, recently told the Denver Post. \"Personally, I'm very skeptical about what they're claiming to do.\"\n \n But let's suspend that disbelief for a second, and assume that the Chinese weather manipulators can indeed halt Beijing's summer rains. Tampering with the city's weather may well exacerbate Beijing's infamously polluted air, which contains the highest levels of poisonous nitrogen dioxide on the planet. \"The only thing that cleans up the pollution is the rain,\" explains Veerabhadran Ramanathan, an atmospheric scientist at the University of California-San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography, in a recent interview with USA Today. \"And if they are going to suppress rain, my worry is the pollution will be oppressive. It's a Catch-22.\" Staging endurance running and cycling events in such conditions could cause athletes to perform wretchedly and possibly even endanger their health - thus tarnishing the luster of China's big moment on the world stage.\n \n So, what do you think? Should the Chinese try to manipulate the weather during the Olympics? Or should they let nature take its course?http://blogs.discovery.com/good_idea/2008/05/should-china-tr.html\n \n Is anyone asking what the crowds will think of these chemicals raining down on them as the planes fly overhead during the games, seeding these rain heavy clouds?",

   "China's 'greatest' Games to begin amid new terrorism threat \n China has declared it is ready to stage one of the greatest Olympics ever, but a new terrorist threat, pollution concerns and human rights controversies hang over final preparations.\n \n China has also warned that terrorists from home and abroad pose a massive threat to the event.\n \n This swung into focus late on Thursday when a Muslim separatist group in China made a new video threat, warning Muslims to keep their children away from the Games.\n \n The Washington-based IntelCenter, which monitors extremists, said the nearly six-minute video shows flames consuming a Beijing Olympics logo and an explosion over a venue for the competition.\n \n It featured a masked, turbaned speaker clutching what appears to be an assault rifle.\n \n The SITE Intelligence Group, meanwhile, said the speaker identified himself as a member of the Turkistan Islamic Party (TIP) and warned Muslims, \"Do not stay on the same bus, on the same train, on the same plane, in the same buildings, or any place the Chinese are.\"\n \n The TIP is an ethnic Uighur and Muslim organisation seeking to create an independent state out of China's heavily Muslim Xinjiang province.\n \n In July, the IntelCenter said the group had taken credit in another video statement for a deadly bus bombing in Shanghai in May and warned of new attacks in China during the Olympics.\n \n Critics have accused Chinese authorities of exaggerating or fabricating threats so that they have an excuse to silence critics, but Beijing has made no apologies for its crackdown.\n \n The suffocating security precautions China has employed have dampened some excitement, with a few critics dubbing the event the \"No-Fun Games\".\n \n Polluted Games:\n A mixture of pollution and fog again cut visibility across Beijing on Thursday despite much publicised emergency measures to improve air quality.\n \n The pollution has been particularly embarrassing for China because it has highlighted to the world one of the worst side-effects of its historic modernisation drive - massive environmental degradation.http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/08/08/2328137.htm",

   "Are you trying in vain to change the subject with another panic? It's good that the IOC gave the all clear and declared the games safe from airborne pollution.\n\n \n First of all, is it against your religion to post a link that supports your claims, because I haven't heard that anywhere. but, after the billions of dollars a host nation spends in preparation for the Olympics, did you doubt they would get final approval if all of the venues were completed in time? Do you think the IOC made them pass a pollution test before approving them? I think not. \n \n And tell me penfold, how have I tried to change the subject, or cause a panic? Does the truth about China's pollution problems scare you that much? And regarding the alleged terrorist threats, I agree with Critics who have accused Chinese authorities of exaggerating or fabricating threats so that they have an excuse to silence critics, but Beijing has made no apologies for its crackdown.\n \n But leave it to you to blame me for trying to cause a panic rather than focussing on the article about the Chinese Governments heavy handed methods for dealing with political dissidents with suffocating security precautions that impact so many people. \n \n The real issue remains the pollution problems, which persist in spite of smileys unsupported claims last thursday that pollution levels decreased by 80% after one rain storm. How allegedly intelligent people could even believe that boggles the mind. Here's the most recent update I could find. 8:44 AM today: \n THE PROBLEM\n Air pollution in Beijing is a problem. Figures for particulate matter (PM10) - tiny airborne particles caused by the burning of fossil fuels like petrol in motor vehicles - are regularly several times higher than the WHO air quality guideline level of 50 micrograms/cubic metre.\n In fact the WHO's usual target level - without allowing for daily and seasonal variations - is even lower, at 20 micrograms/cubic metre.\n \n Beijing's figures even exceed the WHO's interim target for developing countries of 150 micrograms/cubic metre. The interim or \"easy\" target is intended to encourage developing countries to begin gradually cutting down emissions.\n \n The Beijing authorities admit they are still having trouble bringing down PM10 levels, one of the main pollutants in the city.\n The BBC is using a hand-held detector to monitor PM10 levels outside the BBC office in Beijing in early afternoon.\n The Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau also publishes a daily reading based on an average figure for a 24-hour period taken from a variety of locations around the city.\n For example, on Monday 28 July, the BMEPB reading was 98 - compared to the BBC's figure of 134.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7498198.stm\n \n These numbers show that in true form the Chinese authorities will lie and fudge the actual numbers at every turn in order to give the appearance that air quality is safe without concern for the health of the athletes. Their concern after all is their appearance, not for telling the truth about the air quality. I have posted other links above that showed they actually changed the locations of monitoring stations. Removing stations where numbers were too high and placing them where the numbers were lower. \n \n Now, in typical fashion, come back at me penfold and make me the bad guy for reporting this info rather than responding to the issues being exposed here. http://content.usatoday.com/community/utils/idmap/32367206.story",
