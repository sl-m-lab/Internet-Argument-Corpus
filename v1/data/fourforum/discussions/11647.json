Otherwise you just look like a poser. You incorrectly have ad asper per aspera When the correct cliche is: Ad astra per aspera.\n \"To the stars through difficulties\" or \"To the stars in spite of difficulties.\"\n The motto of the state of Kansas, USA and Campbell University, Buies Creek, North Carolina, USA.\n This motto suggests that we achieve great things only by encountering and overcoming adversities; it will be rough going, but we will make it.And the a in Ad should be capitalized. Just so ya know. emoticon_xgood Now don't say I never gave you anything. emoticon_xangel\nYou are absolutely correct. . . .AGAIN. It was a typo and shall be corrected poste haste. See, we libs don't mind saying we made a mistake. . . . .\n \n PS\n \n This was also the motto of the military school (HS) from which I graduated. . . .August Military Academy. http://www.amaalumni.org/",
