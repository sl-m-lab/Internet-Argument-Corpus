We saw the whip crack and he fell back into line until recently.\n \n Now he is giving speaches where he not only sticks to the ascertation that burying yourself in debt is a bad thing, but points out the the dollar dropping like a rock is pretty bad, too. He also points out that it is inevitable that foreign investors will start pulling out at some point when the economics of the mess get bad enough (and some seem to think he implied that time is here or already passed).\n \n Is he looking to get fired, or have the realities of the situation finally reached a point that he is tired of trying to put a happy face on a troll?",

   "Regardless of the election status, Greenspan has always been pretty good about towing the line. I think that this is a pretty radical departure from his general policy.\n \n What would I do differently currently? Not much. In the past I would have recommended a large drop in interest rates as opposed to repeated 1/4 point drops (I think most agree now that this would have been a sensible thing to do, though at the time I don't think people realised that the economy was not going to rebound as it has in the past).\n \n I am not suggesting that Greenspan is at fault in any of this, or even that there is really anything he can do to control the situation. Controlling interest rates only gives you so much control over the economy. \n \n In the past, interest rates have risen in response to market demand for expansion capitol. This does not seem to be the case this time around. Demand for expansion capitol seems fairly low. It seems that we are raising interest rates in order to keep foreign (and domestic) investors financing our debt in the face of a weak dollar and massive deficit spending. \n \n This being the case, it seems that maybe the fed has lost a lot of the influence they once had over the economy. At one tiem even a slight drop in interest rates was enough to stimulate the economy. Now it seems that, not only has having extremely low rates not helped, but we are willing to sacrifice the new home market by raising rates in the face of a weak dollar in order to keep our debt funded. \n \n \n This is comparable to a small business owner going to his uncle Guido for a high interest loan in order to make payroll.",

   "I believe the amount people/businesses can borrow now even at new low low rates is very limited, as indicated by Greenspans burying in debt comment.

Especially since from what I have read that the only large amounts of foreign investment in the US is used to buy Tbills. Most foreign investment is going to countries like China.\n \n \n \n I fear to see what is going to happen if interest rates in the US rise by 3 percentage points.

How many people will be forced into bankruptcy and how many people will by upside down in the mortgages as the housing market drops.\n\n \n I don't think it will take even 3% to drive the housing market under and drive people into bankruptcy. \n \n I remember about 5 years ago I was talking to some friends about the decline of domestic manufaturing and heavy industry and the catastrophic effects it could eventually have on our economy. I jokingly said \"within the next ten years, I bet we see interest only home loans become popular\". Everybody laughed. After all, nobody would be stupid enough to rent their home from the bank.\n \n Now, you see them advertised on TV and by all accounts they are incredibly popular. Forget about building equity. It is more important to get that monsterous house that you can't actually afford. Most of these folks are signing up for variable rate  interest only mortgages. \n \n I suppose that we could relate this back to the ills of american consumerism and a need to feel accepted. Instead, lets lay the blame where it truly belongs. Who are these XXXXXX? What kind of XXXXX rents their house from the bank? Don't they realise that when interest rates go up (and they surely will) that their expected payment will also increase, and that any minor burp in the housing market will put them badly upside down in their home?\n \n This seems to be the mentality the American public is running with right now. go ahead and borrow against the future, even if it doesn't look so rosy. \n \n If some schmuck wants to run his personal finances that way, it doesn't bother me one iota. I hope he and his family are very happy living in the cardboard box they will end up in when a 1-2% interest rate hike devalues their house 20% and they haven't managed to build any equity in it.

   "Alan Greenspan is an economist. A very well respected one. He's giving his best professional opinion.\n \n His appointment to the Board of Governors is a 14 year appointment. His appointment expires Jan 31, 2006.\n \n Let's all hope he gets reappointed to the Board - let hope he wants to be reappointed. - and let's hope he remains the Chairman for as long as he's willing. He's brought us through some tough economic times.\n \n His resume is long and impressive in the private sector. He'll be fine without us. Will we be fine without him?\n \n I don't think his statements were politically motivated. Had he wanted to influence politics, he'd have \"gone public\" last month. I don't think he's ever \"towed the line\". Politics isn't his job. Money is his job. How well he does his job impacts the political arena, and that's not lost on him. But sounding the alarm is absolutely his job. He'd be remiss in not doing it.\n \n I suppose GWB could poll the Board looking for a potential chairman who's willing to say trade deficits don't matter, but would we want him to? And can he find one?\n \n http://www.kc.frb.org/fed101/\n \n From that website\n \n -----------------------------------------------------\n \n Board of Governors\n \n The Washington, D.C.-based Board of Governors, known as the Federal Reserve Board, is the national component of the Federal Reserve System. The Board consists of seven governors, appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Governors serve 14-year, staggered terms to ensure stability and continuity over time. The chairman and vice-chairman are appointed to four-year terms and may be reappointed subject to term limitations. \n \n Among the responsibilities of the Board of Governors are to guide monetary policy actions, to analyze domestic and international economic and financial conditions, and to lead committees that study current issues, such as consumer banking laws and electronic commerce.\n \n The Board also exercises broad supervisory control over the financial services industry, administers certain consumer protection regulations and oversees the nation's payments system. The Board oversees the activities of Reserve Banks, approving the appointments of their presidents and some members of their boards of directors. The Board also sets reserve requirements for depository institutions and approves changes in discount rates recommended by Reserve Banks\n \n The Board's most important responsibility is participating in the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which conducts our nation's monetary policy; the seven governors comprise the voting majority of the FOMC, with the other five votes coming from Reserve Bank presidents.\n \n Board members are called to testify before Congress, and they maintain regular contact with other government organizations as well. The chairman reports twice a year to Congress on the Fed's monetary policy objectives, testifies on numerous other issues and meets periodically with the Secretary of the Treasury. \n \n The Board funds its operations by assessing the Federal Reserve Banks rather than through congressional appropriation. Its financial accounts are audited annually by a public accounting firm, and these accounts are also subject to audit by the General Accounting Office.\n \n --------------------------------------------\n \n Federal Open Market Committee\n \n The Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, is the Fed's monetary policymaking body. It is responsible for formulation of a policy designed to promote stable prices and economic growth. Simply put, the FOMC manages the nation's money supply. \n \n The voting members of the FOMC are the Board of Governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and presidents of four other Reserve Banks, who serve on a rotating basis. All Reserve Bank presidents participate in FOMC policy discussions. The chairman of the Board of Governors chairs the FOMC.\n \n The FOMC typically meets eight times a year in Washington, D.C. At each meeting, the committee discusses the outlook for the U.S. economy and monetary policy options.\n \n The FOMC is an example of the interdependence built into the Fed's structure. It combines the expertise of the Board of Governors and the 12 Reserve Banks. Regional input from Reserve Bank directors and advisory groups brings the private sector perspective to the FOMC and provides grassroots input for monetary policy decisions.",

As you point out, last summer he made a couple of negative references to the deficit/dollar problems, dropped that and immediately swung back to painting the rosy, pre-election scenario of a 'growing' economy. \n \n His latest comments, warning that abnormal deficits and trade imbalances will eventually drive interest rates higher in a need to service that debt, were nothing new to anyone but the administration stooge Snow, brokerage economists touting their overpriced equity issues and the American public. Let's not forget Bush fired his last treasury secretary when he started making rude noises about the deficit. \n \n I see Greenspan's announcement as preparing the world and the US Public for continuing deficits, ongoing government expansion and additional conventional military/homeland defense spending to support administration foreign policy. All he was doing was telling Japan, China and lesser purchasers of US securities that keep this leaky old boat afloat and depend on our trade imbalance that we're prepared to pay the higher rates in order to continue our insanity. \n \n 7-8% is what investors want, myself included, to offset the dollar's current and future deterioration.

US vehicle manufacturers, mired in cash rebate and zero interest sales incentives, will take a big hit, considering that their only remaining profitable market segments are SUVs and p/u trucks, both sensitive to gasoline price increases.
