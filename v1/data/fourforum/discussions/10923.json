She doesn't fight for what's right, she does whatever the polls say is safest. \n\n \n I think all politicians take polls into consideration. However, I see plenty of evidence that Mrs. Clinton fights for what is right on issues that are most important to myself, as a voter. For example, health care. She stood up for health care and took on the industry at a time when the issue was NOT popular and many Democrats were too cowardly to stand beside her. Her record on other women's issues, too, is clear and strong, along with civil rights. Not a series of \"present\" votes, in an attempt to appease the religious far right.\n \n \n \n One of her main duties as a U.S. Senator is to provide checks on the President, and she has failed in that task utterly. Whether it's stopping an unjust war or preventing the trampling of our civil rights, Clinton should have been voicing her opposition to Bush. That was her sworn duty, but the polls didn't show strong support for that position, and so she went with the flow. She is no leader, and there is no way she should be president. \n\n \n I don't think her Iraq votes reflect polls so much as her aspirations as a female political candidate. There's no way a woman is going to run for president with a chance of winning in the conservative U.S. without a \"peace AND strength\" presentation. Her Iraq votes, IMO, and in combination with her specific commitments on the troop withdrawal issues, may actually place her strategically in a much stronger position than Mr. Obama for pulling us out. For delivering on this issue. Not to mention the electability factor. \n \n And do not forget that Mr. Obama wants to pump MORE money into the defense industry. And that his Patriot Act vote reflects the same compromise on our civil rights as Americans. Just as he wasn't there to vote on the invasion, either. Who knows what he would have done? His big endorser, Mr. Kerry, was just as dumb as the rest of those Democrats.\n \n Also note that, now, Mrs. Clinton has key Senate endorsements from individuals who voted against the initial invasion and are strong on veteran's issues (e.g. Maxine Waters, Patty Murray, Charles Rangel).\n \n Mrs. Clinton is much stronger than Mr. Obama as a coalition builder, which is what gets results.\n \n Note, too, that her administration appointments would likely be better. We are not just voting for a president, but an administration.\n \n \n As for why Obama declined the debate, have you even bothered to check?

Given that she's running an attack ad on the issue I wouldn't say it's impossible.\n\n \n The Clinton campaign did not extend the invitation. Wisconsin T.V. did. She accepted, he did not.\n \n While it may not be in Mr. Obama's interest as a politician to accept the invitation, it is in the interests of the American people to have both politicians debate publicly, specifically state positions and differences, and commit themselves strongly on where they are headed. As far as Iraq, health care, foreclosures, and other issues of national/international import.\n \n I am more sympathetic to a candidate who is willing to put themselves on the line, than one who is trying to cover him/her/self.

He was accused of raping 3 different women in separate decades. He is a criminal. So forgive me for not treating what Bill Clinton represents as a simple indiscretion. Or for holding Hillary responsible for defending him for treating women like so much meat as she claims to be a defender of women's rights.\n \n That is why I called her a political whore who is more concerned about her personal power than the issues she claims to care about.

   " It is not about Mr. Obama. It is about the American people.\n\n \n Senator Obama agrees with you. Here's what he's said about why he doesn't want to debate in Wisconsin: \n \n Because I have to talk to voters. Every chance I get to talk to voters we're not only picking up support but I'm also learning, listening, finding out from them what they are concerned about. The debate exercise is one that I think has become fairly predictable. I could make the arguments on behalf of Senator Clinton that she would make against me in a debate. We all know them; you guys could too. I'm sure the same applies on the other side. On the other hand when we have a chance to talk to voters directly we have a chance to give them a sense of where we want to take the country. And that's my priority in these closing weeks. http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/15/clinton-goes-all-out-negative-in-new-ad/\n \n Sounds reasonable to me. Especially since we know the real reason that Mrs. Clinton wants to debate is that she will reach more people more cheaply than her ads will and she's running low on cash. \n \n \nIt is also a disgrace that the candidate whose wife makes so much money in the health care industry -- and when, in that industry, so many medical professionals aware of the real issues support mandated universal health care -- that Mr. Obama's position is basically: \"No We Can't.\"\n\n \n It's interesting that we know exactly how much Michelle Obama made in her hospital job last year, isn't it? Since we have access to the Obama's tax return. It sure would be interesting to see the tax return of Bill and Hillary Clinton too! \n \n I'm one of the uninsured poor. I'd like to see a single payer system - period. Expanding and adapting Medicare which already has an admirable level of administrative costs, seems to me the best way to go. Anything less than \"single payer system\" is going to be inadequate and involve far too much compromising with the insurance industry and God knows who else, imo. \n \n Both candidates have disappointed me on this issue. I think either of their plans will get manipulated and distorted by Congress before anything is actually passed so the details of their respective proposed plans don't concern me. Either Senator will get something passed and it will be a step in the right direction that may or may not be better than nothing for me personally. \n \n In other words, I don't have high expectations. But I hardly think it's accurate to say that Senator Obama's position is \"No We Can't\". He has a plan. Mrs. Clinton has a plan. Plan, plan, everyone has a plan. But not the right plan. \n \n I couldn't care less about seeing them debate their differences because it will just aggravate me that neither one has the proposal I want. \n \n \nMr. Obama is not only a chicken, but a fraud.\n\n \n I'm sorry to see you stoop to the level of name calling.",

So did Mr. Kerry's and so did Mr. Gore's. And Mr. Gore was a VERY strong candidate. So, Mr. Obama is indeed a Republican darling. (1) They can defeat him more easily so it is in their interests to support the weaker candidate, and continue to attack Mrs. Clinton, with the help of the Obama campaign, (2) his campaign is essentially divisive to the Democratic Party in this respect, and (3) even if he did win, he would not IMO be as effective as Mrs. Clinton in executing policies and decisions. Nor are his policies as reflective of the Democratic Party. Finally, the so-called \"polarizing\" affect of Mrs. Clinton is nothing more than a bogus PR campaign fueled by the networks and media. In a very short period, they could have the chorus singing an altogether different tune, if they wanted to. So I yawn when I hear about Mrs. Clinton's alleged \"polarizing\" effect.\n \n Every \"advanced\" and wealthy nation on this planet has the dreaded universal health care proposed by the blonde She-Devil of American politics. And \"mandate\" is just another boogeyman term when the plain truth is we have mandates all the time.\n \n While we need to get out of Iraq, both candidates have indicated their commitment there, and Clinton probably shows the most ability to execute most smoothly, and while maintaining strength in the region. There, she possesses a bipartisan appeal that far surpasses Mr. Obama's dove message. Don't underestimate the American voter there, or Mr. Obama's ability to start moving rapidly to the right and in a highly unpredictable, untime-tested fashion. Mrs. Clinton is also backed by key Senate members long involved in the war and veterans' issues --who also voted against the invasion.\n \n On health care, it is another war -- but here Mr. Obama sounds like a Republican pretending the facts don't exist -- and if you keep ignoring it, it will just go away. But, the facts are that 18,000 Americans die every year on American soil  because we have failed to meet a moral mandate supported by most medical professionals, along with many reputable members of the Democratic Party in Congress. It is a major economic and human issue that -- the Democratic Party overall supports - and that the Obama campaign, while minimalizing, only demonstrates Mr. Obama's lack of realism, lack of moral courage, lack of commitment to a Democratic Party issue (and - a bipartisan issue - since it is also supported by Republicans -- as medical concerns affect so many Americans), and lack of ability to accomplish anything, there. \n \n Indeed, the costs for mandated universal health care would be negative:\n \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyJ5cHLuXuM&NR=1",

   " Sounds to me like she was willing to campaign more in Wisconsin than what you assert, since she accepted the debate invitation, and to further discuss these issues relevant to Americans and Wisconsins, while he did not.\n\n \n I don't know what she was \"willing\" to do, just what she is doing and that's campaigning very little in Wisconsin. The headlines tell the tale: \n \n Clinton Makes 11th-Hour Bid to Compete in Wisconsin FOXNews http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,330914,00.html\n \n Clinton Cuts Wisconsin Visit Short CBS News http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2008/02/16/politics/fromtheroad/entry3840605.shtml\n \n \n \nNote that the local television station, not Mrs. Clinton, and not yourself, outlined the questions -- presumably as expressed by viewers in Wisconsin. \n\n \n Newspaper, actually, not television. And his time was well spent answering their questions apparently -- while Mrs. Clinton was in Texas -- since they've now endorsed him: \n \n Our recommendation in Wisconsin's primary on Tuesday for the Democratic nomination is Barack Obama. That's our recommendation because change and experience are crucial to moving this country forward after what will be eight years of an administration careening from mistake to catastrophe to disaster and back again.\n \n The Illinois senator is best-equipped to deliver that change, and his relatively shorter time in Washington is more asset than handicap.\n \n The Obama campaign has been derisively and incorrectly described as more rock tour than political campaign and his supporters as more starry-eyed groupies than thoughtful voters.\n \n If detractors in either party want to continue characterizing the Obama campaign this way, they will have seriously underestimated both the electorate's hunger for meaningful change in how the nation is governed and the candidate himself.\n \n In an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Editorial Board on Wednesday, the first-term senator proved himself adept at detail and vision. They are not mutually exclusive. http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=718696[/I][/B]\n \n \n But hey, if you're ahead in the polls, why risk your chances by opening your mouth -- and without a speech writer -- if you're not as articulate or smart or quick on the feet as the opposition? If you can't really defend your policies and differences? On health care and foreclosures, that is. Mr. Obama, chicken.\n\n \n Obama not articulate, smart or quick on his feet? Next you'll be saying the guy can't give a decent speech! ;)\n \n While Hillary was campaigning in Texas, The Houston Chronicle was endorsing Obama: \n \n The presidency of the United States is a powerful bully pulpit. The occupant of the White House must not only issue orders, but also inspire and advocate for all Americans.\n \n Of the two finalists for the Democratic presidential nomination, the Chronicle believes Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois is best-qualified by life experience, skill and temperament to be the standard bearer for his party. ... \n \n Obama is both the epitome of the American Dream and well-positioned to reach out to an international community alienated by recent U.S. go-it-alone policies.\n \n The passion and excitement that Obama has brought to the race can only stimulate more citizens to participate in the electoral process. The Chronicle urges Texas Democrats to cast what could be decisive ballots for his presidential nomination.http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/editorial/5546874.html\n \n Both papers made a point of saying there were very little differences in the candidates views. \n \n Obama has also recently won the endorsement of the 1.9-million member Service Employees International Union which represents workers in health care, building services and other industries. \n \n I'm not sure what kind of impact newspaper or union endorsements really have on voters these days. They get his name out there at least for those who may not be paying attention.\n \n I think this next primary in Wisconsin is a nail biter, despite polls consistently slightly in Obama's favor. I'm really surprised that Hillary was so quick to blow it off. Another tactical blunder by her campaign?\n \n An interesting article written back in August, considering all that has gone on since then: \n \n Hillary Control\n The women of \"Hillaryland\" have constructed a carefully managed, always on-message, leakproof campaign.

Here's an exchange between the Clinton/Obama campaign on why Mr. Obama won't debate: \n \n Still dueling over debates\n By Craig Gilbert\n Sunday, Feb 17 2008, 01:50 PM\n The debate debate between the Clinton and Obama campaigns flared up again on \"Face the Nation\" this morning. Clinton accepted and Obama rejected an invitation for a televised Wisconsin debate before Tuesday's primary. The two will debate two more times in other states.\n \n Howard Wolfson of the Clinton campaign and David Axelrod of the Obama campaign clashed over the issue on the CBS program hosted by Bob Schieffer this morning. Here are selected excerpts from the show:\n \n SCHIEFFER: David Axelrod, Senator Clinton wants more debates. Why not more debates?\n Mr. AXELROD: Well, we have one coming up next Thursday in Texas, Bob, and one five days later in Ohio. We've debated 18 times already, this would make 19 and 20 ... Debates are important, and we want to participate them, but it--in them, but it's also important to go out, meet people, have interchanges with voters, have town hall meetings ...\n SCHIEFFER: With all respect, aren't you just doing what people do when they think they're the front-runner? If you're ahead, you don't debate; if you're not ahead, you say `let's debate.' Isn't that really what you're doing here? ....\n Mr. WOLFSON: The Obama strategy here is essentially to debate in states where they're behind, but not debate in states where they're ahead.\n Mr. AXELROD: That's nonsense.\n Mr. WOLFSON: Well, you're debating in Ohio and Texas...\n Mr. AXELROD: That's nonsense.\n Mr. WOLFSON: ...where you're behind, but you don't want to debate in Wisconsin, where you're ahead. That's flat--that's certainly the case.\n Mr. AXELROD: Well, first of all, I don't know whether we're ahead or behind in Wisconsin, but I appreciate the encouragement.\n Mr. WOLFSON: Well, polls say that you're ahead. Polls say that you're ahead.\n Mr. AXELROD: It's a very close race in Wisconsin, but the point is, Howard...\n Mr. WOLFSON: Polls say you're ahead.\n \n http://blogs.jsonline.com/allpoliticswatch/archive/2008/02/17/still-dueling-over-debates.aspx",

   "[B]I don't have health insurance because I buy flat screen TVs instead. \n\n \n Sorry, CUNxTime, but it is a far, far, far stretch to blame the health care crisis on people buying flat screen TVs instead of insurance. Plus, flat screens are far less costly than health insurance, and, the crisis is not limited to those without health insurance, either.\n \n Nor will the Republicans be able to ward off reform much longer with their standard boogeyman cry of \"socialized medicine\". Indeed, many are jumping on the red bandwagon. And, the pressure shall continue to build for reform, for, among other reasons, business can't afford the cost of health insurance for employees.\n \n Here's how one succinct writer put it on an Oregon blog (where BTW you can also read about how quickly a program beyond the minimal government provision filled up, i.e. was unable to meet the need for health coverage in the general populace):\n \n Ask yourself these questions:&#8232;&#8232;1. What is the goal of the health insurance industry?&#8232;&#8232;2. What value added does the health insurance industry bring to the health care system?&#8232;&#8232;\n \n The answers to these questions are simple:&#8232;1. The goal of the health insurance industry is to make money for the companys' management and investors. Whether subscribers receive quality health care is almost completely irrelevant. In fact, the system provides a disincentive to providing good health care (see question 2).&#8232;&#8232;2. Health insurance companies only value added is to manage an actuarial pool of subscribers. But profit incentives are such that denying service is rewarded and providing service is not. In addition, to maximize profit insurance companies are incentivized to cherry pick \"low risk\" subscribers, thus excluding those who need health insurance the most.&#8232;&#8232;\n \n The only health insurance system that can be both cost effective and meet the needs of all citizens is one in which everyone is part of the actuarial the pool, and the objective is to provide quality health care, not to turn a profit. This is, of course, a single payer plan managed either by the government of a charted non-profit corporation. Any systems that is based on free-market style competition between private insurance companies will fail in its primary and only goal legitimate: to provide high quality health care to all citizens.\n \n \n http://currydemocrats.blogspot.com/\n \n \n -Is my house in foreclosure? No, I bought an $80000 house I could afford. Should MY money go to people who bought something they couldn't afford? Hell NO! \n\n \n You must have bought your house some time ago! Or live in a beautiful, but very very remote area. Listen, my friend, you will be paying for the foreclosure crisis one way or another. With indicators as high as the Depression era. And you can thank the Republicans, two administrations of GW (who I never voted for), and the Iraq War (which I opposed before most people even knew we were going in).\n \n I am most confident in the highly capable Mrs. Clinton's ability to handle the vast mess Americans have been left.",

   "So let me get this straight, Antonia. First, you tell me that I didn't choose for myself whether or not to get health care? What makes you think you know this? I'm telling you flat out that I, and tons of other people, opt to spend their money on other things beside health care. Yet you can't believe this? I've just told you it is the case. And you never answered my questions.\n What charities are you involved with and where do you volunteer? Or are you only generous, like your heroine Hillary, with other people's time and money? \n We already have Medicare, medicate, SChip, SSI, and other programs as well as the fact that anyone can go to the emergency room. How's Medicare doing by the way? Its already our #1 federal expenditure. And you talk about profits like they are a bad thing. Do you think that people will go to school for 12 extra years to become doctors and not care about turning a profit? \n \n As far as my house is concerned, I bought it 3 years ago, 20 miles from the Atlantic ocean, just outside of Myrtle Beach, SC. I shopped around and bought a house I could afford. Now you want ME to pay for other people who bought a house that they couldn't afford? You want my taxes to go up so that I can't afford my house, so that we can give money to people who aren't responsible? It's not the govt's job to enable stupidity!\n \n Anyway, its a moot point.

Go back and read my post again, CUNxTime. You're the one who compared the cost of health insurance, let alone health coverage, and whether or not you're insured, to buying a flat screen TV.\n \n You seem very out of touch with the reality of what is going on in the United States as far as the dramatically spiraling costs of health care and coverage, the inadequacy of our current system to meet human needs, and the consequences in the lives of people affected.\n \n \n I'm telling you flat out that I, and tons of other people, opt to spend their money on other things beside health care. \n\n \n Um, well, sure. First of all, if you're healthy -- or believe that you are. Then, of course, there's food, rent, mortgages before news of cancer hits too late or sudden accident or illness bankrupts you and your loved ones. How would you like a sudden 500,000 dollars in hospital bills that you didn't choose, unlike your voluntary 80,000 home purchase?\n \n Besides, most people -- about 65% -- want single-payer. Tons, that is.\n \n \nWhat charities are you involved with and where do you volunteer? Or are you only generous, like your heroine Hillary, with other people's time and money? \n\n \n I don't really get your point, here. Listing my personal involvements with charities is hardly relevant to this argument nor is it any of your business anyway unless I volunteered such information over the internet. \n \n Would you like my name, address, social security number, too? \n \n emoticon_xdonno \n \n On the other hand, statistics on health care and health care coverage can be substantiated. We pay for these things one way or the other (including how we redress -- or don't redress -- the foreclosure crisis). Emergency rooms, for example, are quite costly as we rely on them more and more, for even ordinary procedures. And many economists believe that universal health care or some type of single payer system -- like those adopted by the rest of the \"advanced\" and \"wealthier\" nations of the world -- would be much more cost-effective, even negatively so, compared to what we are doing now. Not to mention improving the quality of health care we are receiving. Where we rank, at present, around 37th or somewhere thereabouts.\n \n Who do you think would be best equipped to serve this nation and the health crisis, CNxTime? John McCain and the surge? Another Republican turn of the head saying, \"The problem doesn't exist. The problem doesn't exist.\"\n \n Yeah, sure.

The fact is most people don't want to SACRIFICE what is necessary to get some of these things. That's my problem with it. Just as you make no sacrifices for your 'fellow travelers', you want the govt. to steal it from someone else. It is simple to generous with someone else's money.

One should not be willing to sacrifice, for example, other people's children for war unless they are willing to go fight and die themselves, or lose their own body parts for such a cause. Nor should we, as Americans, be forced to finance others' ventures in this respect when we are so overwhelmingly opposed to having our tax dollars spent that way.\n \n 65% want single payer, a significant portion want another kind of universal health care, and thus you are significantly in the minority, there.

We certainly should, and, all the evidence shows that we can, and, we will.

Or JM?\n \n For it is strange to me that you single out the Clintons, or that another Democratic candidate would, or that any Democrat would (though you are Libertarian), when Bill Clinton's administration was relatively very successful, leaving the U.S. well intact, and George Bush's has been a virtual rape of this country's economy, not to mention the \"minor\" issue that he completely devastated a middle eastern nation. And has left it in shambles.\n \n It is strange to me that you also single out, Hillary Rodham Clinton, for that matter, who was an inspiration as a remarkable First Lady, has been unfailing in her support of women's rights and family/children's issues, and has a fine record in the Senate. She has also been overwhelmingly supported in her presidential candidacy in New York State.\n \n But, no, I don't have too many illusions about the Democrats either. Or politics, in general. Which is why, for myself, it's more about issues facing the American people, experience, record, and qualifications, and what my vote can or can't do .. what my vote means to me. (And my big mouth, as an American citizen, on the internet! Like all the others we read ...) Rather than the personalities and charisma of candidates. Hey, I don't have lunch or dinner with any of them, and, I am at a point in life where I know that the guru is inside myself. (Though I will forever remember Dr. King's words. Who wasn't an instrument of Washington, since he wasn't a paid politician. It makes a difference in whether or not one is the real coca cola thing.)\n \n So. As I already said, myself and my loved ones can wait, even through another Republican administration. We can wait out further involvement in Iraq, another depression, the Supreme Court appointments a John McCain would make, and those changes to the American legal landscape, the further downswing of the U.S. internationally .... \n \n So, I've made my priorities, as an American and a long-time Democratic voter, clear.

Take this to the bankers, please: since when did the Republicans or Libertarians or anyone who didn't get the right appointment during the Clinton years (and thus, has grudges) become guiding lights of a Democratic candidate's presidential campaign? Since when did the Republican politics of hate and personal assassination during the Clinton administration become the decisive factor for which turns in the road the Democratic Party would take?\n \n Let the Dems get their act together. Get unified. Take some responsibility for their strategy as a group. That would give many people hope. \n \n For you are once again on your way to losing. When you've been handed on a silver platter the opportunity to win.\n \n Last but not least. Where I shall reconsider if my candidate doesn't win:\n \n Let there be Universal Health Care in the United States. Let us join the rest of the civilized globe.

But when people talk about evil personified, or campaign on generalities like hope or ill-defined \"change\", I think their followers may be looking for something of that nature. And I am more inclined to think in terms of pragmatics. I am also cautious when politicians ask me to hang my pragmatics on the coat hook before walking inside. I expect them to commend me for my questioning. And step forward to meet the citizen's challenge.\n \n Hillary's plan is opening up the Congressional Health Plan to all Americans. And, I single out Republicans because their behavior contradicts their own argument as to why we should not have universal health care in this nation. We certainly should, and, all the evidence shows that we can, and, we will. Sooner or later, that small minority which is fighting against it will have cough up into a big pool of money, that includes their own.\n \n I am also well aware of retirement money the Clintons shall receive, as well as the Bushes. As well as any American president, Republican or Democrat. So what is your point? To make the Bill Clinton's retirement fund -- which goes to every American president -- another example of Clinton evil personified? \n \n What's your beef, really? Besides an attraction to the hate campaign, that the Obama people have also participated in, and even though BHO is brilliant at distancing himself from, not taking responsibility, exploiting to the hilt, letting others do that dirty work? I can't support such ####, and under the guise ... of \"unity\"? You should hear what's been done to women in some of the caucuses alone, under the community organizer's brilliant leadership. \n \n Who are you supporting? BHO? Or JM?\n \n For it is strange to me that you single out the Clintons, or that another Democratic candidate would, or that any Democrat would (though you are Libertarian), when Bill Clinton's administration was relatively very successful, leaving the U.S. well intact, and George Bush's has been a virtual rape of this country's economy, not to mention the \"minor\" issue that he completely devastated a middle eastern nation. And has left it in shambles.\n \n It is strange to me that you also single out, Hillary Rodham Clinton, for that matter, who was an inspiration as a remarkable First Lady, has been unfailing in her support of women's rights and family/children's issues, and has a fine record in the Senate. She has also been overwhelmingly supported in her presidential candidacy in New York State.\n \n But, no, I don't have too many illusions about the Democrats either. Or politics, in general. Which is why, for myself, it's more about issues facing the American people, experience, record, and qualifications, and what my vote can or can't do .. what my vote means to me. (And my big mouth, as an American citizen, on the internet! Like all the others we read ...) Rather than the personalities and charisma of candidates. Hey, I don't have lunch or dinner with any of them, and, I am at a point in life where I know that the guru is inside myself. (Though I will forever remember Dr. King's words. Who wasn't an instrument of Washington, since he wasn't a paid politician. It makes a difference in whether or not one is the real coca cola thing.)\n \n So. As I already said, myself and my loved ones can wait, even through another Republican administration. We can wait out further involvement in Iraq, another depression, the Supreme Court appointments a John McCain would make, and those changes to the American legal landscape, the further downswing of the U.S. internationally .... \n \n So, I've made my priorities, as an American and a long-time Democratic voter, clear. And they won't be able to pull the \"but what if nightmare scenario\" on me ... \"you have no choice but to vote this way\" ... \"and take whatever\"\n \n Well, guess what.\n \n I've seen enough in this election. I've seen the Democrats lose a lot of times. I lived through Republican administrations like Dark Ages.\n \n I am a survivor and I hope somewhere on this planet an influential Democrat is reading. (But if not, I am accustomed to being a lone voice in the American wilderness and can survive that, too.) Take this to the bankers, please: since when did the Republicans or Libertarians or anyone who didn't get the right appointment during the Clinton years (and thus, has grudges) become guiding lights of a Democratic candidate's presidential campaign? Since when did the Republican politics of hate and personal assassination during the Clinton administration become the decisive factor for which turns in the road the Democratic Party would take?\n \n Let the Dems get their act together. Get unified. Take some responsibility for their strategy as a group. That would give many people hope. \n \n For you are once again on your way to losing. When you've been handed on a silver platter the opportunity to win.\n \n Last but not least. Where I shall reconsider if my candidate doesn't win:\n \n Let there be Universal Health Care in the United States. Let us join the rest of the civilized globe. This is something, simply put, that I uncynically believe in\n \n While reserving my judgement and my right to think ... about politicians.\n\n I appreciate your lengthy and thoughtful response. However, you are missing one crucial point. The congreesional healthcare plan works because it has a large, tax-generated pocketbook to provide medical care for a measely group of less than 600, active congressmen plus those past congressmen still living. What will happen to your plan when 300million people are to be covered?\n \n By way of apology, I'm traveling with my husband on business and we need to go. I'll be more wordy later.
