   "Someone from your thugworld, \"Sartre\"?\n\n \n Hardly. He was police chief, then mayor of Philly back in my youth. He was known for his compassionate crowd control. ;)\n \n\n Frank Rizzo\n Rizzo, Frank (1920-91), U.S. law enforcement official and politician. Frank Rizzo, the heavy-handed police commissioner of Philadelphia, Pa., who later served as the city's mayor for two consecutive terms, gained national notoriety when he and a number of high-ranking city and police official were charged by the United States Department of Justice with either committing or condoning acts of police brutatlity. \n Francis Lassaro Rizzo was born Oct. 23, 1920 in Philadelphia to a police family. After a brief stint in the United States Navy and three years working in a steel mill, he jointed the Philadelphia police in 1943 and spent virtually his entire adult life in police work. Rizzo achieved prominence as an officer by leading vice raids on gambling houses, strip joints, and houses of prostitution. As he rose through the ranks, he became know as the Cisco Kid, a tribute to his fearlessness and taste for action. \n \n He was named police commissioner in 1967, but his high rank did not stop him from engaging in physical police actions. Known as a \"cop's cop,\" he showed his mettle when, with a nightstick protruding from the cummerbund of his tuxedo, he left a 1969 black-tie affair in order to lead \"my men, my army\" to break up a riot. During his four years service, Philadelphia's tough-talking, take-charge police commissioner expanded the police force, won the enthusiastic loyalty of his men, and kept the crime rate in Philadelphia below that of any other major United States city--albeit amid charges of racism and police brutality. \n \n Having made his name as an unusually successful and vigorous police commissioner, Rizzo campaigned as a law-and-order Democrat in Philadelphia's 1971 mayoral elections. On the merits of his authoritarian approach, which appealed to white ethnic voters, he was elected mayor in November 1971. As mayor, Rizzo continued to support the strong-arm tactics of the police department, and he himself made liberal use of them. He even formed a secret police force that investigated his political opponents. Rizzo claimed that severe law enforcement methods were necessary in a time of rising crime rates, but by 1979, the courts had to decide whether the city of Philadelphia, in its zeal for law and order, had violated the rights of its citizens. On August 3, 1979, the United States District Court, charging that Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo and 18 high-ranking city and police officials either committed or condoned \"widespread and severe\" acts of police brutality. \n \n The justice department suit alleged that Rizzo's crime-fighting techniques involved encouragement of tolerance of brutal practices such as beatings and shootings of suspects. These activities were said to have continued under Rizzo's mayoralty. Some critics charged that Rizzo throughout his career had been hostile toward minorities. Rizzo replied, however, that he prevented destructive ghetto riots in Philadelphia by moving swiftly before minor disorders grew out of control. He also took credit for racial integration of the Philadelphia police force, for increased recruitment of African American officers, and for intensive anti-drug efforts in African American neighborhoods. In October a federal district judge dismissed all portions of the suit (except the portion dealing with racial discrimination) on the grounds that the government had no authority to bring it forth. The last charge was also dismissed, in December, for lack of factual support. \n http://www.dsl.psu.edu/civilrights/articles/frankrizzobio.html \n\n \n Of course, compared to his sucessor, Wilson Goode, who bombed out a black seperatist group called Move and wound up burning down an entire neighborhood, he was a choirboy.\n \n So Simone, is any of this enlightening to you or are you just trolling again? ;)",

They stick together, and the protest is very well executed as a group. They challenge the role of the police (\"Arrest the real criminals\" when they arrive), but they do not verbally assault the police on a personal level (which I've seen at other demonstrations and do not agree with - namecalling, etc).\n \n The police are not psychologically provoked, and calmly and rationally execute their respective tasks.\n \n People are on hand to film and record everything.\n \n There are other demonstrators there to demonstrate against AETNA too, but not be arrested.

But the fact is, it's your messiah and you here who is attempting to impose policies which mirror Hitlers National Socialism, not me or my party which is fighting for them. And if you had the intelligence to actually research Hitlers nationalized healthcare program you would see the similarities it has to what Obama is attempting to impose on us. \n \n So do tell me what is fascist about supporting a smaller and less intrusive government which is what I support. Or what is fascist about supporting a free market system of healthcare which pits insurance companies against each other in a true spirit of competition without government intrusion. Imagine if we had insurance companies competing with each other based on a simple cost benefits premium charge so we could actually determine which benefits were covered based on a hundred dollar deductible for a specific premium each month. Let them complete across state lines and get rid of the government intrusion. \n \n In other words antonia, if the government would exactly the opposite of what its attempting to do and get out of the business of taking over americas businesses, we could get back to actually creating jobs and putting this country back to work rather than building a permanent welfare state which is this criminal presidents agenda. So I'm sorry if the truth hurts you and you find it so pathetic, but that wont stop me from giving it to you.\n \n Here's more in the hope of opening your eyes to the enemy you are supporting. It was written in February but it's as true today as it was then regarding his over all agenda. Marxist Obama-nomics Destroy DOW | Editorial\n \n Marxist Obama-nomics Destroy DOW \n Written by JB Williams \n FRIDAY, 27 FEBRUARY 2009 13:21\n FEbruary 27, 2009 \n 14% Lost in First Month of Leftist Power \n By JB Williams \u00a92009 USA\n The DOW Jones average closed at $8,281.22 on January 19, 2009, the night before the Obamanation became an historic reality. A little more than a month later, the DOW continues its free-fall approaching the $7000 mark and nobody knows where the bottom is. But so far, Obama-nomics have cost Americans trillions in new debt and 14% of their savings, in just a month...\n \n \n Hope for economic recovery is fast flying right out the window as Obamanation change sends investors running for cover. Left-leaning news rag Newsweek, proclaimed that We Are All Socialists Now only days after Democratic Socialists claimed unchallenged control of the federal government and started ramming Marxism down the throats of every America.\n \n It appears that the New Leftist regime in Washington DC just can't figure out why private investors won't invest in unbridled socialism. Or is it that they simply don't care, while they are systematically destroying the entire free market?\n \n They are selling socialism under every name they can think up and investors are still fleeing from the market. Clearly intent upon destroying free market capitalism at any cost, under one name or another, they are growing increasingly desperate to make certain that Bush gets the blame for their failed policy decisions.\n \n They have no interest in saving free market capitalism, a uniquely American system which they have long claimed corrupt, mean-spirited and unfair. They only seek to hang its demise around George Bush's neck. Are the people really that stupid?\n \n Before the 2008 election, Democrats told the American people that times were bad due to Bush's deficit spending. Since the election, they have driven the American economy right into the ditch with a level of deficit spending never before seen anywhere on earth.\n \n A week ago today, the Obama White House rushed to settle shaken investor nerves by denying rumors that Obama was going to begin nationalizing the banking industry. The following Monday, they announced that nationalizing banking was indeed their plan, beginning with Citi Group.\n \n Throughout their campaign for power they scoffed at accusations from across the aisle, which suggested they would socialize the health industry once in power. Now they have approved billions in new taxpayer debt earmarked specifically for preparing the nation for socialized medicine.\n \n ACORN, LaRaza get double-dips of pork. Read it and oh, I don't know, just sit and do nothing about it if you like.\n \n They laughed at folks who accused them of stealing elections via their Black Nationalist movement spearheaded by Obama community organizing group ACORN. Since the election, they have given ACORN access to billions in taxpayer funds so that ACORN can guarantee future Democratic Socialist victories in every national election.\n \n The average American voter may indeed be stupid enough to buy Marxist Obama-nomics, but clearly, investors aren't.\n \n Obama has taken to the air waves nearly every day since becoming Resident. He has contradicted himself, caught in his own web of silly lies on almost every occasion. Average American voters continue to place their faith in an empty suit with a blank r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and a secret past, who is leading by committee, surrounded by well-known anti-American advisors who believe in Karl Marx, not Thomas Jefferson.\n \n But investors have a very different opinion of the Obamanation. The Associated Press reports, Economists question budget's economic assumptions. No, Duh!\n \n What Happens When the People Just Say NO?\n \n Investors are simply saying NO! If you want socialism, then you invest in it. And of course, that is exactly what Obama is doing with YOUR money.\n \n But what happens if the taxpayers say NO too?\n \n Obama says he will take care of 95% of Americans by attacking the top 5% of income earners. Talk about a defenseless minority.... Imagine a 95 to 5 battle of any kind. I'd hate to be the 5...\n \n His administration has already sued Switzerland in an effort to force Swiss banks to give up private information on Americans that hold Swiss bank accounts. An unprecedented move aimed at seizing private holdings in foreign investments, protected by Swiss privacy laws for decades.\n \n They will follow the same line of thinking concerning private holdings in places like Nevada and Delaware, long trusted as safe havens for private investors who do not want the federal government up their rear end with a microscope looking for ways to relieve citizens of their legal earnings.\n \n Yet if America were still the land of the free and home of the brave, American citizens would not have to seek secure safe havens abroad just the keep what they rightfully earned from the greedy hands of Washington politicians who gain political power only on the promise of robbing a few so they buy the rest.\n \n What if America's most productive simply say NO?\n \n Socialism Can't Exist without YOUR Money\n \n Your silence has been your consent up until now. Clearly, as long as you are not prepared to fight, they are not finished taking. They won't be finished taking until there is nothing left to take, or until you decide to fight back, while you still have something left.\n \n Which is it going to be? Will 95% of Americans stand in defense of the 5% currently under attack, or will they wait until the 5% are gone and the fed turns its sword on them, before they fight back?\n \n What if the States simply say NO?\n \n Thirty Two states have now filed state legislative resolutions reclaiming state sovereignty and states rights, in an effort to remind the fed that it exists only at the pleasure and benefit of the states and the people, not the other way around, as Obama seems to think...\n \n In a recent column, I wrote Are the States About to Slap the Runaway Fed Down to Constitutional Size? Hundreds of Tea Party and Tax Revolt initiatives are underway across the country. The states and the people are beginning to say NO!\n \n FDR's New Deal turned out to be a Raw Deal and LBJ's Great Society has officially become the most corrupt greed driven private property grabbing society on earth.\n \n Obama's New New Deal makes FDR and LBJ look like staunch capitalists.\n \n Socialism has failed everywhere on earth it has been tried. But the facts seem to have no impact on people who think it will work here.\n \n The American economy was driven into the ditch by Democratic Socialists running the US Congress; history is very clear on that. But how many Americans know history anymore? Most don't even remember that capitalism is nothing more than economic freedom, or that Democrats are currently engaged in the very activities our founding fathers told us to never allow.\n \n Voters are Stupid... But Investors Aren't\n \n Has the left made any contingencies just in case America's productive class decides to say the hell with the nonproductive class anxious to rob them blind?\n \n If taxpayers simply say NO, are they prepared to jail million of angry taxpayers in order to confiscate their property for the greater communal good? Are they prepared to order Martial Law and raid private citizens as the only means to grab what does not belong to them?\n \n How far are they willing to go to take from some according to their ability; and buy those with a false sense of entitlement?\n \n Both investors and taxpayers are CAPITALISTS. That's why socialists need them. Nobody else can pick up the tab for socialism.\n \n But what happens when they decide enough is enough? Or have they already decided?\n \n Capitalists Don't March in Parades\n \n They vote with their wallet.... They stop investing in nonsense and they eventually, stop paying taxes, once they see that their taxes are buying them nothing but grief.\n \n When you find yourself outgunned, your enemy with world class tanks, weaponry and technology, facing 5 to 95 odds... what do you do?\n \n You cut off fuel and parts supply, and watch their weaponry rot and rust in the field, forcing them into hand to hand combat, where they never expected to find themselves.\n \n Likewise, how is socialism advanced in a place where the productive members of society simply refuse to play along? When the means to advance socialism, your money, is simply cut off, like the fuel supply needed to keep tanks moving, then what?\n \n We are talking about America's most productive here. They actually hold all the cards. So far, they have quietly consented to the nonsense via their silence. That was before push came to shove...",

   "What is it about that post that offends you so much antonia? \n\n \n I don't like the name calling and voluminous red baiting you engage in, Archangel. I see it as very counter-productive to real dialogue. Cable television entertainment wrestling. Ann Coulter stuff. It's a waste of time. It's just garbage.\n \n \nIs it the truth it represents as it outlines the quality of people your messiah surrounds himself with?\n\n \n (1) Obama is not my messiah, though I like him as a president. You know very well, too, that I didn't vote for him in the primaries.\n \n (2) I don't know who you are specifically referencing, but presidents surround themselves with all kinds of people. So that is nothing unusual. They can't do their job if they don't collaborate with different sides. So there are plenty of people in there that don't appeal to me either (though not the same ones as yourself, I'm sure). Plus, in general, while I support his views on the public option as a second choice, I am firstly a single payer supporter, and I am not fully comfortable with what he is doing in health care. As you well know because we have discussed it before. For example, I don't think Max Baucus would be in his powerful position without Obama. I think it's possible that Max Baucus is a fall-guy for Obama. (After all, Obama took a lot of money from the health insurance industry too.) And if he's not a \"fall-guy,\" why hasn't the President figuratively skewered him yet?\n \n So if anything, Archangel, IMO, Obama may represent your views on healthcare reform moreso, than my own. My views, personally speaking.\n \n \nTerror in my heart? Why on earth would you think that?\n\n \n If you don't understand why I say that, after seeing the videos of uncomplicated yet intelligent people stand up for the simple and decent principle of health care for ALL, I am surprised you think you understand the bible you say you are reading regularly. \n \n For Jesus of Nazareth reputedly frightened the powers that be for the very reason these folks frighten you and some of your cohorts here at 4forums so much. \n \n \nBut nothing he represents scares me since affording healthcare isn't an issue for me.\n\n \n \"I got mine sucka!\" eh? How Christian of you. How American.\n \n \nYou could and probably will resort to that before we're done here. But the fact is, it's your messiah and you here who is attempting to impose policies which mirror Hitlers National Socialism, not me or my party which is fighting for them. \n\n \n Oh please with this Hitler garbage. Every westernized nation on this planet has a universal health care system. According to your *logic*, the U.S. stands alone against fascism which now possesses every single one of our allies. \n \n At your next tea baggers party, be sure to carry signs with pictures of all of our European friends' leaders, with tiny moustaches painted on their portraits. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Come into the 21st century of medicine, Archangel. Where all people in a civilized, industrialized nation -- well into the age of computer technology and space travel -- get health care.",

   "It's often said that in Palestine, the suicide bombers are social outcasts, or those at the bottom of the social ladder. You have a lot of people with mental difficulties and disorders that seem to cluster together and get involved at the most extreme, self-sacrificing end of the spectrum. I'm sure there are a variety of sociological reasons for it.\n \n If you've spent as much time with hardcore socialists as I have, you'd see their composition is much the same. A reasonably intelligent irate feminist can be their leader. Then you have a couple of hangers on, her boyfriend / girlfriend or occassional lovers form the second tier - they may help come up with schemes and coordinate action and are there largely for personal reasons. Then you have the lowest level of the group; people living on the fringes of society with a variety of \"problems\" who obtain social contact, approval and direction from their participation in the group. It would be difficult to say they put any thought into the causes they support or oppose, much like the suicide bombers of palestine, much like you Antonia, they are only capable of repeating what they have been told to believe.",
