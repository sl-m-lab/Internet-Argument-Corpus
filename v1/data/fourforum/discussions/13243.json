The oft-quoted notion, \"those that can't do, teach\" is bogus. 20k per minute has no value comparison to a room full of human beings called \"children\".\n\n \n I think that coarse phrase came about because of just a few teachers, or possibly teachers organizations, that tend to imply that teaching something is an ultimate authority, that teachers are 'too good' to perform the tasks that they teach, which is false. The 20K per minute thing is a good example of real world experiences/problems/challanges that teachers don't have to be involved with.\n \n More than once though, I've seen someone getting some type of formal recognition who has excelled in some particular subject - accomplished something that got him/her some type of award/promotion etc. When asked about their inspiration, or explanation for their ability, they give credit to one of their past teachers, often a high school teacher. There's little question that the teacher couldn't have accomplished what the student did, yet there's equally little question that the student couldn't have accomplished it without the guidance/enthusiasm that the teacher provided. Teaching is a job that is somewhat different than those who perform the subject taught. \n \n Teachers are special people only if they are good teachers, and they need to prove it on an individual basis if it's something they care about. Probably more than half of the teachers I had were like so many in any profession - someone just coasting through a career trying to avoid as many problems as possible. But the minority of teachers I had were exceptional people - I may be a slightly better person because of them, and I'll never forget them. I'd guess a lot of people feel that way, even if they've never given it much thought. \n \n \nI callz 'em az I seez 'em. Ever read Thomas Sowell's \"Inside American Education\"?

Rosen was also charged with forgery. \n \n New York City's Department of Investigation, which investigated the nonprofit for two years, said the men improperly took more than $290,000 from the organization for their personal use, on top of their already unusually large salaries. \n \n The money -- described in the non-profit's books as business expenses -- went to pay for home renovations and furnishings and new cars, among other things, according to a Department of Investigation report released Thursday. \n \n City investigators said the pair also improperly transferred $875,000 to Air America, which was co-founded by one of Gloria Wise's executives. \n \n \n The loans were repaid by Air America. The New York Times account added:\n \n Two officials at Gloria Wise were directly involved in the radio network, according to the investigation, One of them, Sinohe Terrero, resigned as the charity's fiscal director in 2003 to join Air America, while the other, Evan Montvel-Cohen, a former fund-raiser for the charity, was instrumental in securing the loans to the network.\n \n \n -Tim Graham is Director of Media Analysis at the Media Research Center.\n Indictments Handed Down in Air America-Related Charity Fraud at Community Center | NewsBusters.org \n\n \n Now, notice that I just rubbed your nose in FACTS.

It came in the form of a Bill Dedman article on its website looking at journalists who have given money in recent years to federal candidates, political parties, or political action committees (PAC). \n \n The investigation turned up donations from 143 journalists, including editors, anchors, columnists, reporters and editorial cartoonists, but not executives or publishers. They came primarily from the 200 largest newspapers in the country. \n \n The findings, based on an analysis of Federal Election Commission (FEC) records from 2004 through the first quarter of this year, were that 125 of those went to Democrats or liberal groups, 16 to Republicans or conservative groups, and two who gave to both. That's a major advantage for the Democrats in the major media. \n \n The investigation has resulted in a New York Times columnist being dropped by a paper planning to carry his columns. \n \n Some of the more interesting examples included Guy Raz, a CNN reporter, who now covers the Pentagon for National Public Radio, and who gave $500 to John Kerry's campaign during the same period he was embedded with the Army in Iraq. Other examples include a producer for Bill O'Reilly of the Fox News Channel who gave $5,000 to Republicans, and a financial columnist for the New York Sun, Liz Peek, who gave $90,000 to the Republican Party. \n \n Another interesting example was George Packer, a war correspondent for the New Yorker magazine. Packer, who gave $750 to the Democratic National Committee in August 2004, was candid when asked to comment for the story: \"My readers know my views on politics and politicians because I make no secret of them in my comments for the New Yorker or elsewhere,\" he said. \"If giving money to a politician prejudiced my ability to think and write honestly, I wouldn't do it. Fortunately it doesn't,\" said Packer. \n \n But Packer misses the point. The money doesn't prejudice the writer; it reflects the core beliefs of that writer. \n \n As Dedman sees it, \"The pattern of donations, with nearly nine out of 10 giving to Democratic candidates and causes, appears to confirm a leftward tilt in newsrooms-at least among the donors, who are a tiny fraction of the roughly 100,000 staffers in newsrooms across the nation.\" He writes that the donors said they try to be fair, and not let their beliefs and donations influence their writing and editing, and that it's better to be \"transparent about their beliefs, and that editors who insist on manufacturing an appearance of impartiality are being deceptive to a public that already knows journalists aren't without biases.\" \n \n MSNBC Confirms Liberal Media Bias\n \n\n \n Now go wipe the brown excrement from your face. emoticon_rolleyes",

The video is of a class of students singing a song about President Obama. The activity took place during Black History Month in 2009, which is recognized each February to honor the contributions of African Americans to our country. Our curriculum studies, honors and recognizes those who serve our country. The recording and distribution of the class activity were unauthorized.\n \n If you have any further questions regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact me or Dr. King, Principal of B. Bernice Young School, directly.\n \n Sincerely,\n \n Dr. Christopher M. Manno,\n Superintendent of Schools\n Burlington Township School District \n\n \n Obviously, the school district was flooded with calls because the superintendent felt compelled to compose the letter shown above.\n \n Once again, you have resorted to attempted subterfuge in order to distort the facts. It's difficult for a parent to complain about something that occurred in February if they aren't aware of it taking place until Sept. \n \n \n\n Show them.\n I am not interested in your fantasies.\n I am interested in hard facts. \n \n\n \n No, actually you're interested in twisting the facts as the above clearly shows. You attempted to claim that it must not have been a concern to the parents becauise nothing was said until many months after the fact. That was a disengenuous attempt on your part to distort the issue.\n If you find out in Sept that your kindergarten aged daughter was raped in Feb., does that negate your outrage? \n \n \n\n Gee.\n Are YOU one of the parents of the children involved?\n If not, you have no more room to criticism my opinion than your own opinion warrants criticism... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n\n \n Were the children in the video forced to participate?\n I bet you don't know.\n From what I heard on the Daily Show last night, the parents knew of the events.

That's the wrong message to be sending.\"\n \n Pronchik said he and his wife were never informed about the lesson, which the superintendent of Burlington Township schools says was held in February as part of Black History Month \"to honor the contributions of African Americans to our country.\"\n Review Ordered of Video Showing Students Singing Praises of President Obama - Political News - FOXNews.com \n",

   "So if GW had giving during school speeches, you really think a superintendent should have mandated students to tune into to listen to GW? :)\n\n \n You keep saying it was \"mandated,\" when it has been established on the board that it wasn't mandated.\n \n But I think if GW had given a speech directly addressing students and encouraging them to achieve their hopes and dreams, it would be appropriate (however dull) to show it and discuss it in classrooms. Though I doubt the reception among students would have been as enthusiastic ... Face it, President Obama is very popular among students (and George was never as engaging a speaker).\n \n Also, I think it's always appropriate in social studies/current events to discuss political speeches. This is how students develop their critical thinking skills and ability to view different sides of an issue.\n \n Remember, it's by looking at the present and how they are part of it, that students better understand the past. It's very challenging without life experience to take a speech by someone like, say, Lincoln at Gettysburg and make sense of it without being able to relate it to something in one's own life and experience.\n \n So I think these can be very positive learning experiences, also depending on how the school tackles it.\n \n \n Besides, as has been pointed out, we now know of at least one school that taught its student to praise Obama, not just listen to him.\n\n \n I think you're blowing this out of proportion, jyoshu. I saw the lyrics and it looks like very typical elementary school song stuff. \n \n \"There was a general by the name of George\n Led a small band of men at Valley Forge\n Left the comfort of home for the cold and ice\n They won independence 'cause they paid the price!\n \n \"Freedom isn't free!\n Freedom isn't free!\n You've got to pay the price\n You've got to sacrifice\n For your li-ber-ty!\"\n \n I'm so old and these long ago ditties still come out of me, like the alphabet.\n \n \nIf a teacher had done something like that to students over Bush when he was in office, Dems would have gone NUTS.\n\n \n They'd never have been able to find a school that pro-Bush. But I remember a teacher, for example, who had a Bush picture on her classroom wall like he was Mao Tse Tung.\n \n Did I like it?\n \n No.\n \n Was she a good teacher? She was an excellent reading teacher, as a matter of fact. Despite her communistic leanings ....\n \n It looks like this is a predominantly African American school, and the principal is seizing a golden opportunity for many of the students for whom this presidency means so much, personally. Why do you want to take this away from these kids? Especially considering the statistical odds against African American school children in our society.\n \n These kids are so excited about his presidency. I think it's wonderful that President Barack Hussein Obama came forward and spoke to them directly. He let them know that he had reached a pinnacle, and he had not forgotten them or where he came from. That they are the future, and that they are capable of reaching the stars just like he did, and that they should make the most of themselves. That he expects them to.",
