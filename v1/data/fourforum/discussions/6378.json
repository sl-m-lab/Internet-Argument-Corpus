Anyone care to take a guess at what the final tab will be?",

The alternative is a state disaster insurance fund similar to that in Florida where private insurers limit their exposure to premium revenue and the state has legislation enabling it to assess all state property owners for damage amounts exceeding the state insurance pool. LA doesn't possess the wealth of FL, so I don't know how feasible that bandaid would be. \n \n Rational solutions, such as rebuilding NO above sea level and diversion of the Mississippi River generally fold when confronted by irrational emotion fanned by politicians. Hopefully the public displays common sense on this issue, but our record on that subject is not good. The cost of NO toxic clean-up alone could boggle the mind.",
