   "I posted this earlier and was hoping it would get more attention than it did since I find it to be very significant. Many people explain the violence by Muslim extremists by saying that American foreign policy is to blame. Moderates and liberals have been asking this for years; \"Why do they hate us? It must somehow be at least partially our fault.\"\n \n But I would ask you, why did the Muslims hate the Dutch way back in 1888? \n \n The first ever recorded Tsunami hit Indonesia in 1883. The Dutch sent ships with disaster relief aid. Meanwhile, the Imams and Clerics took to the pulpits of their Mosques and began preaching fire and brimstone sermons about how Allah had punished the Muslim population of the area for being too friendly with the \"infidel\" westerners. When the Dutch arrived in their ships, they were slaughtered by the hundreds at the hands of crazed zealots in 1888.\n \n I guess we would have to also ask, why did the Muslims hate the Dutch?\n \n Can Muslim extremists get along with anyone who they consider to be \"infidels?\"\n \n http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/1230/p01s04-woap.html\n Ripple effects of Indonesia's geological events\n Earlier natural disasters in the 'Ring of Fire' had global repercussions - and altered course of history.",

Many farmers pray to god for good weather, good crops many feel god is punishing them when crops fail. Admitedly this is not as common as it used to be ( a more secular state ). Another factor for why westerners to have stopped stating god is punishing them when bad things happen is the higher level of education that most have, with a better understanding of the environment and science demystifies earthquakes and tidal waves.\n \n Go to a muslim country that is highly educated with a good standard of living for the majority of the population and most will behave just like Christians with different believes. It is the standard of living in some of the muslim countries that causes the extreme form of Islam to take root to any degree ( in any society their will be a few nutballs ie Branch Davidians (sp) Bill Frist emoticon_xangel )\n \n But when that society has a poor standard of living those extremists can take root and grow. Do you honestly think that Hitler would have been able to take power in today's Germany? Or Castro in Cuba, if the majorit of people in Cuba had a good standard of living do you think they would have supported him during the revolution? \n \n I think Germany's government understands that having a large population of poor could result in neo nazi's gaining support, which could be one reason for the social welfare system in Germany.",

   "I actually agree with you LT, to an extent. However, one of the reasons that Muslim countries are so far behind the rest of the world in education and technology is because their form of religion demands it. The only education most of them get is religious education. They can recite the Koran verbatim, but they can't add 2+2. How do you go about educating people that don't want to be educated? Christianity may not believe in evolution, but at least they are not opposed to education. The world's formost neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who was the first to successfully separate siamese twins joined at the skull, is a devout Christian and a creationist. Also, if it were not for Christianity, more than half of the world's hospitals would not exist. I don't recall ever seeing any Muslim hospitals in my part of America.\n \n You also mentioned the belief of many Christians that God is punishing them for disasters, and that is true to an extent. Also true that education has lessened that belief. But I don't remember any large organized groups of Christians believing that God is expecting them to commit mass murder in His name to atone for their punishment. Also, if a good standard of living and higher education are the reason why Christians have never resorted to the methods of radical Muslims, then why are the Amish so peaceful? They have a very low standard of living compared with the rest of the country, they are relatively uneducated too. They even are the victims of more than their fair share of discrimination and persecution, but I don't recall hearing of any Amish uprisings that resulted in the mass murder of innocents.\n \n I think that your points are valid, but they are only a part of the big picture. I think the biggest reason for this behavior is because the Islamic religion and its leaders give just enough reason to believe that the Koran says these things are justified. Just like the bible can be misinterpretted to read that the Jews Crucified Christ, so can the Koran be misinterpretted to say that we \"infidels\" are the cause for all of their misery. I have only read parts of the Koran and I gave up trying to understand it in its English translation, because apparently our translation does not accurately relate the words. So, I would not venture to argue about what it does and does not say. I am only speculating about that. But there MUST be someting in the Koran that talks about killing infidels, otherwise the radicals would not be doing what they are doing.",

   "The largest real difference between Christianity and Islam is that Christianity has drifted further away from the original teaching of its founder, while Islam is still closer to the original teaching of its founder.\n\n Christianity seriously deviated from the teachings of the bible during the middle ages when the Catholic church allowed only the clergy to read and interpret the scriptures. During that time a whole slew of eroneous traditions entered the church. But the reformation of the 1600's brought Christianity back to its roots (mostly). Some traditions learned during the 1200 or so years of Catholic monoply continued to have an influence though because 1200 some years of tradition is hard to break. Christianity is at its best when the church is being persecuted and the true believers are separated from the nominal ones. True Christians will cling to their faith even under threat of death, whereas a \"wolf in sheeps clothing\" will take the easy way out. The problem with Christians today, especially those in America, is that we have it so easy. People have become complacent. In ages past, persecution meant prison, torture and death. Today, many Christians scream \"Persecution!\" just because a court rules that they can't display the 10 commandments. Jesus spoke about a church called \"Laodicea.\" It represents lukewarm Christianity that is niether hot nor cold. Many people believe Laodicea represents today's church in prosperous nations like the U.S. Laodiceans are comfortable and unwilling to take their faith seriously.\n \n \nBy the way how do you reform the teaching of a religions founder to fit modern times and still follow the same religion?\n\n Your question suggests that the spirituality of modern people is different than ancient people. But the whole premise of the bible is that God is timeless, and that the state of our human condition is not something that is dependant upon the age we live in.\n \n I don't know about Islam, but the bible begins with the creation of the world, and ends with its destruction. At that time, the people who are saved throughout all ages will live together with God for eternity. The 2000 years or so since Christ died will seem like a day or two compared with eternity. So Christian religion presupposes that people are basically the same whatever age they may live in. That is why so many of its teachings are still relevant (ie. love your neighbor, love your enemy, feed the needy, don't engage in sin). In order for a religion like Christianity to need to change, it would have to presume that the definition of \"sin\" changes from age to age. It would also have to presume that the conditions of salvation change.\n \n Exactly what modern conditions are you refering to that ancient religions needs to adjust to?",

However I will not even attempt to judge Hitler, because for all I know he may have had a stroke of conscience before he died, repented, and asked God for forgiveness. The bible says that God will accept any of us, no matter how sinful if we just sincerely repent and ask for forgiveness. Of course that does not mean we can just go about doing all the same things we used to do.\n \n As far as homosexuals, I do believe it is a sin, but I cannot condemn someone for something that they do not see as sin.
