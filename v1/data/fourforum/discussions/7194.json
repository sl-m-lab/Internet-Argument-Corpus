   "Why is this kicking up a fuss about recent Kremlin drive to tighten state control over numerous NGOs in Russia? I mean new bill on NGOs sailing through the Russian parliament presently. Russians assert they want to re-register them all to have a better overview of non-governmental organizations in Russia and to curb money laundering. And this could also help our joined combat on terrorism. So what's wrong with it? Why is this barrage of criticism on the American part especially? Actually there is a full-scaled campaign now going on in USA to demonize 'Russian authorities tightening the noose around NGOs'. Involved in this strange hysterical campaign are even such heavyweights as J. Edwards, Democratic nominee in 2004 presidential race and political celebrity J. Kemp. \n Let's clear it up. It's common knowledge that in America itself authorities do keep an eye over funding and expenses of NGOs. Financial feedback from external sources or NGOs activities to shape way of thinking of ordinary Americans is just... taboo! It's unthinkable in the most democratic country in the world. Any going against administration on part of NGOs is nipped in the bud in most severe manner. Yet I've never heard of any voiced reproaches referring to Washington as the regime violating human rights and other things of the sort.\n \n Try to imagine this occur in any other country. Sure there would be outburst of indignation on part of Americans and NGOs themselves in case those measures are applied there. Imo it's simple. In Russia those both sides (America and NGOs) are interested parts in nexus I'd say. Interested in what one might ask. Well it's easy to answer this hypothetic question. America is imposing its vision, its precious democracy and its alien to many national cultures life-pattern and ideas via those NGOs.... sometimes through 'revolutions' ('coups' suites better here). This how it was in Ukraine and Georgia. This how they want it to be in Russia. \n Let's put it plain. America and its allies want to have Russia stable and ... weak. Under Putin Russia is getting strong, slowly but surely. NGOs is good enough tool to explore processes in Russia and 'make corrections' if needed. I don't remember exact figures but NGOs are mushrooming in Russia. There is no financial transparency in their activities. Their sponsors are mainly of foreign origin and stay in shade. By no words this is seen by Kremlin as serious enough threat to national security. Could it be otherwise, I wonder? \n Some human rights activists compare NGOs activities to 'private life'. And they compare the controversial bill, subject of heated debate in Russia, to 'intrusion in this private life'. They are cunning. Even in private life my likes and dislikes and my fixations strongly affect my wife and son. NGOs role in modern society is enormous and it is to be strictly controlled by state structures... just in the way they rightly do this in America. Let's follow their example .... at least in this sphere of life. P.S. Why is strong Russia a taboo?",

   "Russia has every right to be paranoid.\n \n Lets take a look at a well known charity known as Freedom House, which was started up by Eleanor Roosevelt. In this and the last decade, Freedom House (recently headed by James Woolsey) has set up many branches and offices in former Soviet satelites, especially in the central Steppes (ie; Kazakstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrghyzstan), and in Russia itself. It was founded because of the concern \"with the mounting threats to peace and democracy...[and has been] a vigorous proponent of democratic values and a steadfast opponent of dictatorships of the far left and the far right.\"\n \n Russia is Freedom House's main target for this mission. It ranks Russia below North Korea and Lybia as a human rights and civilities offender. Essentially, it puts Russia as one of the biggest fascist governments in the world.\n \n Freedom House uses its offices in the FSU to set up pro american government bodies. The Ukrainian government especially is its biggest concern, because the folks at \"Freedom\" know very well of Ukrainian hatred towards Russia. So when a pro-Russian government makes it into the Ukrainian government, the natural reaction is that they must've cheated. Nevermind that few people in the Ukraine vote, and the ones that do have everything to benefit from Russian influences. So here comes the Orange revolution once more, whose funding comes from that NGO we all know and love, Freedom House, with the job of setting up pro American, anti-Russian government bodies.\n \n In other countries, current ruling bodies have replaced ones that were pro-Russia. The famous example of the Kyrghyzstani government's fall by organised militant political groups funded by Freedom House (I can't recall their names, to be honest). Except you never read that anywhere in western papers, you've probably never heard of Kyrghyzstan.\n \n I do believe that President Putin has every right to do what he's doing. A strong centralised government body has always historically proven to come out on top when building or rebuilding a nation.\n \n \n I'll direct you to an article that will do the telling better than I ever will.\n \n http://www.exile.ru/2005-December-28/freedoms_just_another_word_for_fascism.html",
