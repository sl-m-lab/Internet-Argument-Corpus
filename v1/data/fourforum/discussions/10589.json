I, too, am surprised that anybody would consider the Amero a fringe lunatic tin foil hat type deal as well. When the presient of one of the countries confirms it, I think it kind of moves away from \"conspiracy\" to \"fact\".\n \n The problem is that they are going about it all backward. The current plan seems to be to get the latin American countries all using one currency and then the US will join, and then Canada. The problem there is that while it makes a great deal of sense for the US to switch to a common currency like that, it does not make as much sense for anybody to throw in with us. Lets say we do get all the latin american countries using a single currency. Do you really think they are going to be anxious for the US to come in with our trillions in debt and inasane amount of outstanding cash and sink their currency? I think not. There is simply no way at this point for any country to partner up with the US on a currency deal that would not screw the other country.",
