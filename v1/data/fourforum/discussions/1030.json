Isaiah tells us of the angel Lucifer (light bearer) and his fall from heaven. He used the same deception that he fell prey to in the Garden, he told man that he could be like God. This disobedience cursed all man after him and all creation. Thorns, disease, and death are all side effects of realizing good and evil. This is why when a person asks, \"Why would God allow bad things?\" we must understand we are reaping what we sowed. Logically someone out there will say, \"I was not in the Garden.\" True, but if you were you would have chose disobedience too.

   "8000 light years is a picture of 8000 years ago. If you believe this then it doesn't matter what speed sin moves. If you can see 8000 light years away then you are seeing light that is 8000 years old. That means that you are seeing exactly what was occurring 8000 years ago. Therefore if you see that a natural disaster is occurring 8000 years ago and natural disasters could not occur before sin, then you have to admit that the young Earth idea has been disproven.\n\n \n \n Light years is a measure of distance not time. Yes light currently has a standard speed of roughly 300,000km/s. There is evidence to indicate that light traveled much faster than that at the beginning of the universe. \n \n 1) http://www.aw-verlag.ch/Documents/GravityPotentialCausedByVariableSpeedOfLight.PDF\n 2)http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9908058\n \n If that is the case then objects that are 8000 lightyears in distance are not really 8000 years old. \n \n However, given the current speed of light then we won't know for 8000 years. The truth is not that we are not seeing something that is 8000 years old, as we really cannot know that without knowing the conditions at the beginning of the universe. What we do know is that we won't know about that objects current state for 8000 years.",

Lets say that light leaves the sun right now. 1 year from now it will reach Planet X which is 1 light year away from the sun. Now true or false, if a telescope from Planet X could see 1 light year away, it would be seeing an image of the sun based on how it looked 1 year ago.\n \n So if an object is 8000 light years away and we can see it are we seeing the object as it was 8000 years ago?",

If that is the case then we would need to know those conditions prior to calculating such a time frame. That is the point I was making in my previous post. We don't know the conditions at the beginning. The big bang theory and chaos theory both support the faster light speed hypothesis. \n \n It would be like me saying I was traveling 60mph when I got to phoenix from 60 miles away. You cannot say how long it took me to get here without knowing how fast I was traveling during the entire trip, including the beginning.",

I trust Him.\n \n The calculations on the age of the earth, in christian or scientific circles, is dubious at best and actually highly controversial regardless of which side you land on. \n \n My decision that the earth is younger is based on a similar theory to what I was discussing and it has to do with radioactive decay also not occuring at the same rate across time. There is a current formula for half life using a natural logarithm function. I think at the beginning of the universe that would not apply as the conditions at that time were hardly the same. \n \n It is an assumption that the laws of physics have always been and continue to be the same across the expanse of time. Reasonable given mans current situation but it may be that thinking that has prevented man from discovering the grand unifying theory. It is odd that there is such a diversion in theories between quantum mechanics and astronomical mechanics. the equations that work for one break down in the other.",

Just looking into space will show us that the universe has been here for more than 8,000 years. Continental drift can show this as well. The several Earth axis shifts and the history we can gather from that would also indicate an Earth older than 8,000 years. Rock formations, elements in polar ice caps, location and state of fossils, oil and diamond deposits, and I'd even include evolution as data that can indicate this Earth is pretty old.",

That is as much as I am willing to commit to. Younger than most think and controversial from both christian and scientific perspectives.\n \n As for your other evidence, again, I point out that we make assumptions about the nature of the universe (and the earth) at its beginning and it is possible those assumptions are wrong. Given the evidence, ie the split between quantum mechanics and astronomical physics, I would say the assumptions are likely wrong.
