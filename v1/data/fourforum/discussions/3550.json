   "There are many emails floating around with stats to back up claims that the War in Iraq and reconstruction efforts are going well, despite what you hear and see in the media.\n \n Here is one such email outlined at snopes.com:\n \n http://www.snopes.com/politics/war/reynolds.asp\n \n Snopes then gives a link to orwelliantimes.org to dispute all claims presented and also gives a blow by blow critique of the Bush-Allawi Press Conference given on Sep. 23, 2004.\n \n http://www.orwelliantimes.com/2004/04/26.html\n \n The raw transcript: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A44972-2004Sep23.html\n \n So, read through these links, if you like, and provide any more insight into Bush's statements, Allawi's statements, or the orwelliantimes.org statements.\n \n TTFN.\n \n .",

   "The Ansar al-Sunnah Army is probably our main foe in Iraq right now. They are the ones responsible for most of the beheadings and murders of Iraqi national guardsmen and police. \n \n Here is a list of Ansar al-Sunnah propaganda videos of beheadings and guardsman murders. There are also videos from other militant groups such as the \"Salafist Brigades of Abu Bakr Al-Sidiq,\" and of course we can't forget groups loyal to al-Sadr or \"Zarqawi\" (if such a person exists).\n http://www.thenausea.com/updates.html \n It's actually better if you don't watch them.\n The first one on (27.10.04):\n It shows one guardsman being decapitated and the others being shot in the head. \n Caption with translation of the warning at the end of the video:\n http://www.thenausea.com/elements/usa/iraq%202004/10/11murder.htm\n \nThe Ansar al-Sunnah Army said it had beheaded one and shot the 10 others. The group had announced on Tuesday (26.october. 2004) that it captured the 11 Iraqi National Guardsmen on the highway between Baghdad and Hillah.\n \n \"After investigating with them and (hearing) their confessions, it turned out this group was responsible for guarding the Crusader American troops in Radwaniya area and what's around it in southern Baghdad,\" a statement posted on the web site said.\n \n The claim's authenticity could not be independently confirmed. Insurgents have regularly targeted Iraqi security forces, blaming them for working with Americans. The video came five days after insurgents ambushed and killed 50 unarmed Iraqi soldiers as they headed home from a U.S. training camp northeast of Baghdad.\n \n The Web site on Thursday had a video link showing the 11 National Guardsmen reading out their names and the name of their unit.\n \n It then showed the graphic execution of the men - some of whom were squatting, their hands tied behind their backs, before they were shot or beheaded.\n \n A voiceover - identified by a subtitle as that of the head of the group or \"Emir al-Jamaa\" - addressed all Iraqi security forces.\n \n \"A call to the army and police: Repent to God ... abandon your weapons and go home and beware of supporting the apostate Crusaders or their followers, the Iraqi government, or else you will only find death.\"\n \n A written statement warned that \"we will not forget about the blood of our elderly, women and children that are shed daily in Fallujah, Samarra, Ramadi and elsewhere on your hands and the hands of those you work with.\"\n \n \"We have repeatedly warned you and you refused but to support the Crusaders. Your weakness and love for the dollar drove you to this fate, which is incomparable to the torture God has for you,\" the statement added.\n \n The movement has claimed responsibility for a number of attacks and hostage takings, including the kidnap and murder of 12 Nepalese who were seized in August. \n \n\n \n The nice welcome that our soldiers receive in Iraqi cities:\n http://www.thenausea.com/elements/usa/iraq%202004/10/Ambush_072704.wmv\n \n So, I wonder, does anyone really think that these people will ever relent, be caught or killed? Will every miltant group that sees us as Crusaders ever be wiped out? Will we ever have control over Iraq? Will these groups just keep killing the Iraqis we train so that we can never leave? If we do eventually cut and run, will these groups just take over?\n \n .",
