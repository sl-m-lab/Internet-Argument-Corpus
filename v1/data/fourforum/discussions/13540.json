   "Carrie Prejean sex tape forced ex-Miss California&#39;s lawsuit settlement: report\n \n \nA legal standoff between Carrie Prejean and Miss California USA officials reportedly ended when a Pageant lawyer played his trump card: a sex tape far more hard-core than the nude pictures which had previously scandalized her - and in which she had the starring role.\n \n After being shown the hardcore home video - in which she apparently engages in a solo sex act - Prejean dropped her million-dollar-plus demands, TMZ.com reports, and bolted from the negotiating table.\n \n The tape has never been released publically.\n \n The negotiations war ends with Prejean getting zilch, TMZ.com reports. Pageant officials will reportedly pay her lawyers and a publicist $100K, with nothing going directly to her. \n \n The settlement also relieved Prejean of any financial obligations to pageant organizer K2Productions - including repaying her breast augmentation surgery.\n \n Prejean, who was stripped of her Miss California crown in June, had filed suit against pageant officials claiming religious discrimination. \n \n She found herself an unlikely political lightening rod and cause celebre for the Right for voicing faith-based opposition to gay marriage during the Q&A portion of the Miss USA pageant.\n \n Prejean subsequently found herself squarely in the sites of Perez Hilton, the judge who'd asked the question.\n \n The openly gay celebrity blogger excoriated Prejean on his Web site, and suggested her answer might have cost her the Miss USA title.\n \n Officials say they relieved her of the title for failure to attend contractually-obligated appearances.\n \n In addition to accusing her of failing to repay $5200 for the breast augmentation, their counter-suit alleged Prejean broke her contract and lied about semi-nude photos.\n \n \"We're so glad to be back in the business of beauty and out of the litigious system that is Carrie Prejean,\" Keith Lewis, of K2 Productions, told the Daily News. \"It's wonderful to put this behind us.\"\n \n \n\n \n So she has a sex tape as well.\n \n The hits just keep on comin', LOL. It is sad though. Why can't anyone just come completely clean on anything from the get go? \n \n First the semi-nude photos, then the breast augmentation, now this sex tape. \n \n I'm laughing to myself at how the Christians so rabidly defended her back when it was all going on!",

   "From FoxBusiness...\n \n Life Coaching Carrie Prejean - FOXBusiness.com\n \n I thought the op-ed did a pretty good job of expressing mine and many others' views on this ad-nauseum over-played issue--particularly that the gay marriage issue with regards to this girl is entirely over-hyped. (By those that want to bash conservatives, of course; the very act of creating this thread being a perfect example of said bashing.)\n\n Of COURSE it's only about those that YOU THINK \"want to bash conservatives\"....\n THAT we get FULLY!\n \n When it comes to the CONSERVATIVES EMBRACING Prejean as a poster child for their movement, THAT WILL NEVER see any criticism from you as \"over-hyped\", will it... emoticon_xdonno\n \n \n \nPrejean was ASKED about the issue; she didn't make it one.\n\n At THAT point, you're right.\n IMMEDIATELY after the question was asked, and for a very short time there-after, she did NOT make it one.\n \n But later, she most definitely DID make it one as she thoroughly embraced the anti-gay marriage movement. Appearing in their ads. Speaking out on their behalf.\n \n But of course, you don't want to talk about the FULL story, do you...\n emoticon_wow\n \n \n \nHaters of the family values movement did that.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n It's funny how \"family values\" is a code word for discrimination against gays, yet its the gays who object to the discrimination and prejudice who are supposedly the \"haters\"... emoticon_xdonno\n \n \n \nIf the attention that is put politically toward gay marriage was put toward more serious problems in the country, there would be some actual good things happen.\n\n Just out of curiousity, is ANY of that comment aimed at the people who are working \"politically\" to try to PREVENT gay marriage???\n emoticon_wow\n \n You don't have to answer. It's pretty obvious from your one-sided approac that the answer is no...\n \n \n \nFor some reason Foundit clearly has it out for this young lady. I think it speaks to an overall unfair attitude some liberals have toward family-values conservatives in general.\n\n And again...\n When \"family-values\" is a code word for \"we want to discriminate against homosexuals\", it's supposedly the GAYS WHO OBJECT who are the problem...\n \n \n \nI mean, wow! Making attractive pageant girls (for which gay marriage is completely peripheral) that people are going to sympathize with the new enemy-number-one in the gay marriage fight by digging up all their past mistakes isn't exactly the most thought-out PR strategy. This ain't rocket science here--not exactly the way to win over the masses! But hey, whatever.\n\n So you think...\n \n Here's a sadly non-scientific poll which shows over 75% of respondents would disagree with your mentality, and instead think that the religious right should think twice about Carrie...\n Religion - US News and World Report\n \n I shouldn't have to tell you that beauty is only skin deep.",
