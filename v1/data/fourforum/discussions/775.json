   "In 1909 the schooner Wyoming was launched from the Percy & Small shipyard in Bath, Maine. She was the state-of-the art in wooden hulled shipbuilding. She was a six masted schooner and, at 329 ft., the longest ship with an all wood keel and hull ever built. She was the last of nine wooden hulled, six-masted schooners built between 1900 and 1909, and one of seven built by Percy & Small. All were 300 ft. or more in length. They were all state-of-the art.\n \n The Wyoming had 90 steel crossbraces. Even while she was yet on the drawing boards the marine engineers who designed and built her knew from experience with shorter ships that the length of the Wyoming would exceed the structural limits of wood. For this reason they attempted to defeat, or at least support, the laws of physics and the principles of marine engineering with steel. It was to no avail. Not even the steel bracing could prevent the flexing and twisting that resulted in the separation of the hull planking. The Wyoming required constant pumping, as did her sister ships. The Wyoming leaked from the day she hit the water until the day, 14 years later, when she foundered and broke up off of Monomoy Island while riding out a storm at anchor.\n \n It is said that she could be seen to snake (movement of the bow and stern from side to side in relation to the midship) and hog (movement of the bow and stern up and down in relation to the midship) while underway. The action of the waves, in even calm seas, caused the planking to be sprung beyond the capabilities of any calking that could be devised. The Wyoming and her sisters were used, for the most part, for short, close-in coastal hauls, generally in sight of land. At the first sign if inclement weather, they could run for port. The Wyoming served for several years as a coal hauler, as did several of her sisters.\n \n I have always had a great love for windjammers. I have some very expensive books that deal with the minutia of their construction and for years my hobby was to build full rigged wooden models. I spent hours climbing over the decks of the U.S.S. Constitution in Charleston Navy Yard, admiring her construction. The Wyoming must have been a beautiful vessel. But she was a beautiful anachronism. At about 300 ft. the structural capabilities of wood were exceeded beyond the abilities of engineering and design to remedy\n \n Few other ships of this size were built of wood. One exception was the four-masted medium clipper barque, Great Republic built in 1853. She is sometimes reported as the longest wooden ship ever build with a length of 334 feet, but more usually she it is claimed that she was 325 feet. The Great Republic also had 90 steel cross braces, 4 inches wide, 1 inch thick, and 36 feet long. Nevertheless, she sprung her hull in a storm off of Bermuda. She was abandoned when the water in the hold reached 15 feet.\n \n And yet, creationists want me to believe that a 450 ft. (minimum) vessel of ALL wood construction was able to withstand a storm of 40 days and then remain at sea for almost a year, manned by only eight people, without the efficient pumps of the turn of the century, calked with nothing more than \"pitch inside and out\". Not to mention the overwhelming necessity of the limited crew to feed and water thousands of animals and to muck out thousands of pens (and then carry the result of the mucking up two decks in order to throw it overboard). When was there time for pumping (24 hours a day if the above is any indication) and the constant recalking in a futile attempt to stem the flow.\n \n You may perceive this as an argument from incredulity similar to those that are so typical of creationists, but I just can't believe such a fairy tale. Experience with real wooden ships sailing in real oceans indicates that Noah's ark would not have survived many days of the 40 day storm.\n \n My opinion of Noah's ark is that that boat don't float.",

   "One creationist response to the impossibility of an ark of wood of the size described in the Bible has been that the ark didn't have masts and sails. Somehow they feel that it is the masts that cause the hogging and snaking of the hull, rather than the uneven action of the waves. That just wasn't the case. What happened with the Wyoming and her sister ships was that as the ship progressed through the waves the bow was first lifted by a crest while amidships was still in the trough and the stern was on another crest. As the crest moved along the ship the bow and stern would be in a trough while the midships would be on a crest. Now consider how this problem would be compounted by waves hitting the ship at an oblique angle, for example hitting the bow at an angle and pushing it off to one side in relation to the rest of the ship.\n \n But still, creationists ignore reality and maintain that the big box that was the ark would be saved because it had no need of sails and could just float with the waves. The problem becomes worse.\n \n If we are to believe young earth creationists, the flood began with a violent storm. I have been told that it was the worst the world has ever seen. It is reasonable to assume that there were great waves during this storm. YECs picuture the ark floating peacefully between the waves. But that, of course wouldn't be the case. A vessel without headway is unable to stear. Even to modern ships, the worst case is to lose headway in a storm. What happens is that, without the ability to steer, the waves turn the ship broadside to the waves. Sailing on a ship in this position is, I am told, a very unpleasant experience. The book and movie, \"The Perfect Storm\" describe a Japanese vessel that had engine problems and was in exactly such a position. The ship took on water faster than the pumps handle and the ship nearly capsized several times. The captain had even ordered that the crew prepare to abandon ship. She almost went down.\n \n Here is the problem in violent storms. A ship that encounters a giant wave bow on is able to climb the wave because the stern is still in the trough when the bow goes over the top of the wave (or through it in many cases). The danger here is that the ship will break in the middle as both the bow and stern are lifted as the midships teeters on the wave crest.\n \n But it is worse if the ship is broadside to the waves. In that case the ship is rolled to one side as the wave hits. But instead of climbing the wave, the ship tends to slide down the face of the wave into the trough. Since the ship cannot move sideways through the water at the speed of the wave, the wave rolls over the ship. This is the case when the height of the wave exceeds whatever dimension of the ship it encounters. If you encounter a 50 ft wave in your 32 ft cabin cruiser, you may be capsized by the wave. If your ship has a 50 ft beam and encounters a 90 ft wave broadside, it is likely that you will capsize. It has happened. Sometimes the ships right themselves, but they can only take that sort of abuse for so long.\n \n And that doesn't even take into account the sick animals (who get sea sick just like people). In fact, in rough weather animals have been known to die of fright.",

   "All you have shown is that today we couldn't this. You forget that Noah got the design from God.\n\n So your claim is that the laws of physics have changed? You see, it is not a matter of design. It is a matter of the physical limits of wood. Wood is flexable, and the longer the piece of wood, the more bend there is in it. Possibly you have seen a roof with wood supports that spans a large area. To do it requires huge trusses unless you add column supports. And I'll bet there aren't any spans of over 300 ft. where only a wood truss is used.\n \n For a ship/barge the problem becomes worse. If you make the keel thick in an effort to reduce the hogging and snaking, you reduct the room available inside. Even at that, it would be impossible to eliminate all of the flexing and that flexing would spring the planks of the hull. There is no calking that has been devised that can fill an ever changing gap between planks.\n \n And, of course, recourse to a miracle is the standard creationist answer when faced with evidence that their mythology isn't historic. \"POOF! Goddidit!\" And so, what is the point of the whole exercise in the first place? Why didn't God just POOF the ark into existance or just POOF anyone he didn't like out of existance? He wanted to teach the only just man in the world a lesson? Sure worked. First thing Noah did was to get drunk.\n \nAnd you do realize that Noah was about 500 years old when he started the ark. How much could you learn or know in 500 years?\n\n Mythology. But nevertheless, shipbuilding has been going on for a lot longer than 500 years. There have been a lot of skilled shipbuilders who have passed along their knowledge from generation to generation. Do you think that every time someone builds a ship that they invent the whole process? Nah. 300 ft is about the limit for wood no matter how you design it. Even worse it you cast a big box adrift in a huge storm. How did the animals survive the rolling and rolling?",
