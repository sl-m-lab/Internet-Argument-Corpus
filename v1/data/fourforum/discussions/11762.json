   "Archie, first time I've seen those charges. Any documentation?\n \n And, pray, not from the faux scholar Reardon.\n\n \n Sure thing. If you weren't reading leftist propaganda only, you would be aware of this very publicly dispersed information. Here's an excerpt from the linked article.\n \"The record clearly indicates a serious and concentrated pattern of unacceptable and at times, illegal activity occurring over a lengthy period, which establishes a course of conduct totally at odds with the ethics of our profession,\" Col. Julia Grimes, then head of Alaska State Troopers, wrote in March 1, 2006, letter suspending Wooten for 10 days. After the union protested it, the suspension was reduced to five days.\n \n She warned that if he messed up again, he'd be fired.\n \n \"This discipline is meant to be a last chance to take corrective action,\" Grimes wrote. \"You are hereby given notice that any further occurrences of these types of behaviors or incidents will not be tolerated and will result in your termination.\"\n \n It's nearly impossible to know whether other complaints have come in about Wooten in the last two years. His personnel file is confidential. But the fact he remains on the force is an indication that he hasn't had the sort of trouble that Grimes warned against.\n \n Grimes declined to comment, as did various troopers involved in the investigation.\n \n '... NOT WITHOUT A BLEMISH'\n \n As the investigation got under way in 2005, Wooten was in the midst of a bitter divorce from Palin's sister, Molly McCann. The couple was fighting over custody of their two young children. Accusations flew from both sides.\n \n Troopers eventually investigated 13 issues and found four in which Wooten violated policy or broke the law or both:\n \n \u0095 Wooten used a Taser on his stepson.\n \n \u0095 He illegally shot a moose.\n \n \u0095 He drank beer in his patrol car on one occasion.\n \n \u0095 He told others his father-in-law would \"eat a f'ing lead bullet\" if he helped his daughter get an attorney for the divorce.\n \n Beyond the investigation sparked by the family, trooper commanders saw cause to discipline or give written instructions to correct Wooten seven times since he joined the force, according to Grimes' letter to Wooten.\n \n Those incidents included: a reprimand in January 2004 for negligent damage to a state vehicle; a January 2005 instruction after being accused of speeding, unsafe lane changes, following too closely and not using turn signals in his state vehicle; a June 2005 instruction regarding personal cell phone calls; an October 2005 suspension from work after getting a speeding ticket; and a November 2005 memo \"to clarify duty hours, tardiness and personal business during duty time.\"\n \n \"Mike is not without a blemish,\" the union's Cyr said. But some of the problems noted by Grimes were small matters, he said. Many troopers were told to reimburse the state for personal cell phone calls, he said. Wooten had to miss work for court during the divorce, he said.\n \n The union president, Rob Cox, is a 17-year trooper veteran who worked alongside Wooten in the Valley. Cox said he never thought of him as a rogue cop.\n \n It's significant that Wooten served for a while on the Special Emergency Reaction Team -- like a SWAT team, Cox said. Officers have to be especially cool-headed to perform in crisis situations, Cox said.\n \n Wooten was the first backup officer to arrive at the scene of a standoff in 2006 at the Valley trailer home of Donald Voorhis.\n \n TROOPER INVESTIGATION\n \n Wooten's history spilled into public view after the July 11 firing of Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan. The former commissioner has said he doesn't know why Palin wanted him out but wonders if Wooten's situation was part of it. He has said that members of Palin's administration, and the governor's husband, talked with him about the accusations against Wooten, which he considered improper.\n \n \"Never put pressure on Walt Monegan to fire -- hire or fire -- anybody,\" Palin responded.\n \n The troopers' investigation into Wooten began after Chuck Heath -- Wooten's father-in-law and Palin and McCann's dad -- alerted troopers about a domestic violence protective order McCann had obtained against Wooten on April 11, 2005. McCann filed for divorce the same day, according to the court docket.\n \n The trooper had not physically assaulted his wife but intimidated her and threatened to shoot him, Heath told troopers, according to a memo about the complaint.\n \n The same day, a concerned neighbor of the couple called troopers with more accusations, including alcohol abuse, based on what Heath and McCann had relayed to him. Wooten seemed \"disconnected\" lately, the neighbor said. He told troopers that Heath and McCann were afraid to call troopers themselves.\n \n \"Extreme verbal abuse & violent threats & physical intimidation,\" McCann wrote in her April 11, 2005, petition to the court. He had driven drunk multiple times, threatened her father, told her to \"put a leash on your sister and family or I'm going to bring them down,\" her petition says. A judge issued a 20-day protective order to keep Wooten away.\n \n In written orders to Wooten sent the next day, trooper Capt. Matt Leveque echoed the court's directive. Leveque, now a major, also told Wooten to give up his department-issued guns, badge, credentials and vehicle during his off-duty time, while the order was in effect.http://www.adn.com/politics/story/476430.html",
