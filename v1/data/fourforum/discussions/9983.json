They were funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). Their results appear in this week's issue of the journal Nature.\n \n Darwin once proposed a co-evolutionary \"race\" to explain how natural selection might account for the evolution of very long nectar spurs in flowers, said Hodges. \"In Darwin's race, plants with the longest spurs and pollinators with the longest tongues [to tap the flowers' nectar] would be favored by natural selection, and--in a never-ending process--continually drive the plants' spurs and the pollinator tongues to exceptionally long lengths.\"\n \n But it turns out, Whittall and Hodges found, that evolution acts in a more one-sided fashion in many plants: the plants evolve nectar spurs to match the tongue-lengths of the pollinators. Then the process stops, and only starts again when there is a change in pollinators.\n \n Whittall and Hodges proved this idea by testing the columbine genus Aquilegia, which is pollinated by bumblebees, hummingbirds and hawkmoths.\n \n They found that most of the columbines' nectar spur length evolution happened during shifts in pollinators from bumblebees to hummingbirds, and from hummingbirds to hawkmoths. In between these shifts, evolution of the columbines' nectar spurs came to a halt.\n \n Whittall and Hodges' work provides evidence that evolution may occur in a stop-and-go pattern--one in which adaptation to specific pollinators occurs very rapidly, followed by periods of no further evolution until another pollinator shift occurs, according to William Zamer, deputy director of NSF's division of integrative organismal systems.\n \n \"In the case of these flowers, changes appear to happen relatively rapidly in response to changes in pollinators,\" said Zamer.\n \n ###\n NSF's biocomplexity in the environment emphasis area and division of environmental biology funded the research.\n \n NSF-PR 07-065 \n \n The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent federal agency that supports fundamental research and education across all fields of science and engineering, with an annual budget of $5.58 billion.

Harder,3 Enrico Coen2{dagger}\n \n To understand the constraints on biological diversity, we analyzed how selection and development interact to control the evolution of inflorescences, the branching structures that bear flowers. We show that a single developmental model accounts for the restricted range of inflorescence types observed in nature and that this model is supported by molecular genetic studies. The model predicts associations between inflorescence architecture, climate, and life history, which we validated empirically. Paths, or evolutionary wormholes, link different architectures in a multidimensional fitness space, but the rate of evolution along these paths is constrained by genetic and environmental factors, which explains why some evolutionary transitions are rare between closely related plant taxa.\n \n ===============================================",

   "I am sure that WW will like the first couple of paras in the article.\n \n =======================================\n \n \n Organisms display great diversity in shape and architecture, but the range of observed forms represents only a small fraction of what is theoretically possible (1, 2). For example, when patterns of shell coiling are considered within a mathematically defined space of possible forms (morphospace), the observed forms are restricted to only a subregion of this space (3). One explanation for such restrictions is selection (4). However, it is likely that developmental and genetic mechanisms also play a role. For example, the absence of vertebrates with more than four limbs is thought to reflect an interplay between both developmental and selective constraints (5, 6). Developmental mechanisms restrict the range of genetic and phenotypic variation available for selection, whereas selection influences the evolution of developmental processes. Such two-way interactions can be unravelled using morphospaces based on developmental genetic mechanisms. We take this approach for the evolution of inflorescences, which has a history of both theoretical and molecular genetic analysis.\n \n The arrangement of flowers on a plant reflects an iterative pattern of developmental decisions at the growing tips, or meristems. Each iteration occurs over a time interval known as a plastochron (7), during which a meristem may either switch to floral identity or continue to produce further meristems and, hence, branches. As the number of iterations rises, the number of theoretically possible structures increases rapidly (8). However, only a small subset of these structures corresponds to inflorescences observed in nature (Fig. 1). They are grouped into three broad architectural types: (i) panicles, which comprise a branching series of axes that terminate in flowers; (ii) racemes, which comprise axes bearing flowers in lateral positions or lateral axes that reiterate this pattern; and (iii) cymes, which comprise axes that terminate in flowers and lateral axes that reiterate this pattern (9-11) (Fig. 1, D to I). The appearance of each inflorescence type varies according to the arrangement of lateral meristems around the stem (phyllotaxy), the pattern of internode lengths, and additional variations on the three architectural themes. Although panicles, racemes, and cymes are all found among flowering plants, a restricted range of types is evident at local taxonomic levels: Genera seldom include species with both racemes and cymes.\n \n ============================================\n \n I am curious as to how WW will explain the relationship between platochrons and vitality.",

An article describing the study is published in the June 7 issue of the journal Nature.\n \n The research builds on work done by Charles Darwin more than 140 years ago.\n \n \n Columbine flowers, found all over the Northern Hemisphere, but with exceptional diversity in Western North America, keep their nectar at the bottom of a spur that ranges from fractions of an inch to several inches long, depending on species. Bees, birds or hawkmoths that visit to drink the nectar get dusted with pollen.\n \n Justen Whittall, currently a postdoctoral research fellow at UC Davis, built a genetic family tree of the North American columbines as part of his Ph.D. research with Scott Hodges, professor in the Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology at UC Santa Barbara. They found that columbines repeatedly evolved in a predictable sequence from short to medium or from medium to long nectar spurs without becoming shorter. This progression matched the increasingly long tongues of bees, hummingbirds and hawkmoths, respectively.\n \n Almost three-quarters of the variation in the flowers occurred rapidly when new species formed, most likely to take advantage of a new pollinator. The remaining variation could have occurred by a more gradual mechanism, like that proposed by Darwin.\n \n \"There's strong selection on the plant to draw pollinators into the flower for successful pollination,\" Whittall said.\n \n In 1862, Darwin predicted that a jungle orchid with a long, deep flower would be pollinated by a moth with an equally long tongue. Such an insect was discovered in 1903, but was not actually observed pollinating the orchid until 1997.\n \n \n Both Darwin and Alfred Russell Wallace, the other pioneer of evolutionary theory, proposed that flowers and pollinators engage in an evolutionary race. If the flower spur becomes slightly deeper, pollinators will tend to evolve to have longer tongues, and then the flowers become slightly deeper again, and so on in a series of small, reciprocal steps. \"However, the columbines have evolved incredibly recently,\" Hodges said. \"So, the tongues of their pollinators were probably already at an optimal length for other flowers when the columbines came on the scene. The plants apparently had to evolve rapidly to fit the tongues, but the tongues probably evolved very little.\"\n \n Hodges explained that long-tongued pollinators can always reach nectar of flowers with short spurs but animals with short tongues can't get food from flowers with long spurs. This means that shifts in pollinators will generally be to ones with longer tongues and that spurs then get longer and longer during evolution.\n \n \"It's a great example of evolution at work, happening right in my backyard,\" Whittall said.\n ====================================\n \n I post it in toto so that it will be available for our discussion. l have added emphasis in places to bring certain things to your attention.",

On the other hand nothing in the press release would indicate that a particular pollinator feeding on an individual mature plant in any way shape or form altered its throat depth. After all how could it? Everything is already developed at that stage. The article REPEATEDLY referred to evolution however and none of the data given there indicates ANYTHING other than adaptation of the population to differing pollinators over multiple generations (much more than two).

He does not bother with the data. In the case of the columbines he (nor we) do not have the actual data. However what WW did not consider is that all the columbine data must be retrosepctive in nature having to do with the current nectar spur lengths of various columbine species and with the current pollinators of those species. Combined one suspects (based on the authors accessible papers) with genetic analyses of the various species. Under such conditions IF there were neo-Lamarkian effects, they would be totally obscured by the passage of time and be indistinguishible from standard evolutionary effects due to mutation and selection within the linages.\n \n To test WWs theory one would have to expose Columbines which have short nectar spurs by restricting the avaliable pollinators to long tounged varieties. According to WW MOST of the individual plants of the first generation would somehow (by Lamarckinan mechanisms) extend their pollen spurs in direct response to such exposure, and this change would be inherited by future generations. MOST of the individual plants in the group would reproduce rather than just a very small minority with mutations for longer pollen spurs. Should anyone wish to do the experiment it should be relatively easy to do. Nobody is likely to however - perhaps WW will do it and publish the results - he probably should elaborate the design to include additonal treatments and controls however.

Lively* Basic Quantitative Genetics\n \n Remember that the strategic formulations allow us to predict the equilibrium point and the direction of selection when the population is away from the equilibrium, but they do not allow us to predict the rate of evolutionary change. For some problems, we would very much like to know the response to selection and rate of change as well as just the direction of selection and the local maxima. For this purpose, we switch now to quantitative genetics. \n \n Basic quantitative genetics. The \"breeders equation\":\n \n R =h2S\n \n That is: the response to selection (R) is equal to heritability (h2) times the selection differential (S). See Falconer and Mackay p. 160 for why \"h2\" (it come from Wright, where h was the ratio of standard deviations).\n \n The selection differential (S) is just the difference between the mean of the population and the mean of the individuals that reproduce. For example, if the individuals that reproduce are larger than the average individual in the population, the selection differential is positive. \n \n The response to selection (R) is just the difference between the mean of the parents before selection and the mean of the offspring. \n \n Clearly the response to selection will be usually be less than the selection differential: R < S. Darwin recognized this, which is part of his reasoning for suggesting blending inheritance. h2 is simply the scaling factor that gives us the response to selection as a proportion of the selection differential. (Please note that h2 is not, in this case, h*h; instead it us simply the name given to the scaling factor. The scaling factor is also called \"narrow sense heritability\"). \n \n Note that if R=h2S, then h2 = R/S. Hence the scaling factor can be estimated from an experiment where both R and S are known. R/S is the proportion of S that is R; that is why I think of heritability as a scaling factor. \n \n The scaling factor can also be estimated as the slope of the linear regression of mid-parent values on offspring values as follows:\n \n Offspring value = h2 times mid-parent value + 0.\n \n Thus if h2 is less than one, offspring are not as extreme as their parents",

Moreover, the process of replication is not fully precise, sporadic mutations may produce new offspring strings, which are slightly different from their parent templates. The dynamics of such an autoreplicating system is described by Eigen's differential equations. These equations have a unique asymptotically stable state, which corresponds to those strings that have the highest rate constants (fitness). Fitness of binary string is calculated as a graph-theory similarity between a folding (phenotype) of respective string and the so-called required folding. The presented method offers a detailed view of mechanisms of the molecular Darwinian evolution, in particular of the meaning and importance of neutral mutations.\n Keywords: Artificial life; Artificial chemistry; Fitness landscape; Eigen theory of replicators; Molecular Darwinian evolution; Neutral mutations; Neutral evolution.",

Second, cur-\n rent research activities are discussed along three application dimensions: modeling,\n information processing and optimization. Finally, common phenomena among the\n di\u00aeerent systems are summarized. It is argued here that arti\u00afcial chemistries are\n \\the right stu\u00ae\" for the study of pre-biotic and bio-chemical evolution, and they\n provide a productive framework for questions regarding the origin and evolution of\n organizations in general. Furthermore, arti\u00afcial chemistries have a broad applica-\n tion range of practical problems as shown in this review.",

   "If the specified morphological change takes place in fewer generations than that required by the pure chance of darwinist 'random,accidental, coincidental to fitness(adaptedness), genetic mutation', then you are talking adaptation (evolution) by specified organic response to specified environmental stimulus, (EAM or \"neo-lamarckism' or 'developmental evolution' or whatever, organismic teleologically directed response mechanism), and not the random, accidental, coincidental to outcome, ateleological, directionless, RM+NS, selectionist mechanism hypothesized by darwinists.\n Nope the failure of one hypothesis in this instance cannot serve as confirmation for a different one. Both theories might prove incapable of predicting the outcome accurately. You have to test both quantitatively. You are once more making a gaps type argument. Namely if Natural Selection does not predict X then X is due to the \"What I say\" mechanism. It won't do you know.\n\n \n **\n Nonsense. Wherever the solution must be one of two pssibilities, \"A\" or \"B\", then thgere is no bifurcation fallacy. In this in stance the mechanics of evolution are either directed adaptation (EAM), or they are not. If they are directed they be neither mechanically predetermined nor stochastic. Since mechanically pre-determined is already off he table, the bifurcation of causation is strictly either/or--Eiether EAM. i.e., endogenously motivated and directed behaviour causes morphological change processes, or that those alterations over time are directionless, (meaning they are not 'processes' as per the english language, but simply a stochastic, disjointed, series of accidental events.) The method for discerning option \"A\", directed and teleological, from \"B\", stochastic unrelated directionless events, is the duration and specificity of the process of adaptation, wherever such a process occurs. The _specificity_ of organismic change (response particular to stimulus) is empirically observable and measurable. The _duration_ of a directed, heuristic adaptive process can be distinguished from the duration of a series of random, directionless genetic accidents eventually arriving at a lucky coincidental, serendipitous conjunction with organismic need, mathematically.\n \n Of course, if you like, you can keep a 'control' population, one that experiences no novel stimulus, and watch and see if, after a few hundred generations, any mutant variants pop up displaying the special adaptive changes demonstrated by the stimulated experimental population, but strictly by your stochastic series of directionless random accidents. But here's a clue--it will never happen. Any difference that makes a real and positive productive difference in a complex system never, ever, happens by accident.",

You won't get a rational argument, because there is no reason there that could provide one.\n\n \n **\n And when a small clique of ideologues plays Humpty Dumpty with words in common English usage, distorting their true and established meanings, first within the confines of their own church, then parading their semantic corruptions to the world until the public has accepted these verbal contortions as legitimate, a terrible fraud has been perpetrated that has nothing to do with 'science', as they claim for their motive.\n \n The principal fraud practiced by materialist/atheist/darwinists upon the english-speaking public is to take teleological words, words that imply intelligence, volition, judgement and goal-seeking, and use them as if they were compatible with their own mindless, mechanical, directionless,and chance-based view of change in the universe, especially as applied to bioforms, as biological evolution by Random (but adaptive)Genetic Mutation plus \"Natural Selection\".\n \n Now that all the little Humpty Dumpty speakers have rushed to this thread to cackle over what they perceive as a semantic mistake of mine wrt the word, 'means', this might be an excellellent opportunity to show them up for what they are. Semantic frauds.\n \n Charles Darwin originate the fraud of using teleological language inappropriately when he invented \"Natural Selection\". \"Selection\" is a teleological word that describes a dynamic, volitional, intelligent, directed process of choice between options, and according to criteria of judgement, in order that the organism, or its tools, artefacts and instruments, will successfully achieve a particular and desired end result. No being that is not intelligent, wilful, etc., has the teleological capacity to choose, to practice 'selection', although such a beings tools and instruments, not having that capacity in se, may have it built into them intentionally and deliberately.\n \n The word 'selection' is therefore radically different from the word 'sorting', in which passive entities are separated into sets according to happenstance and physical mechanics, with no particular volition, no act of choice, and no teleological end preferred and sought after. Except in those cases, such as a sieve, where the 'sorting' process and its utensils are subordinate to 'selection', and the 'sorting' artefacts, implements, and instruments are devised, designed, and built by a being capable of 'selection' , simply in order to assist in and further the attainment of it's goal via 'selection'. \n Eg., save the pasta but lose the water by using a strainer.\n \n When materialist/mechanist/atheist/darwinists use 'selection', they falsely use this teleological word to imply teleology to an unthinking public, whereas in point of fact, since their ideology denies the presense and reality of teleology in the univers, existense, and above all, biology, they should be using the word, 'sorting', and would do ifg they were the least bit honest. \"Sorting\", after all, occurs in nature, mechanically, and not just in artefacts of organismic devising as tools of 'selection'. Wind and water, for instance, mindlessly and mechanically sort dust from pebbles, etc., mindlessly, unintentionally, to no particular end and to no particular purpose, according to the dynamics of mechanical [physical] forces. Since that is how materialist/mechanist/atheist/darwinists see all 'change' in the universe, including biological change [evolution] as happening, they would, if not trying to deceive the public,( and themselves), employ the ateleological word, 'sorting', where they now, and always have, falsely use the teleological word, 'selection'.\n \n Which brings me to the word, 'means'. That word always implies, \"means to an end\" when used as a noun, and as such is another teleological word, just like 'selection'. Another teleological word falsely used as descriptor of some intangible abstraction instead of the physical medium or instrument implied. In this instance, the false abstraction of 'selection' is being described as the 'means' of evolution. Well, here we have it. Is \"NS\" the 'cause', the mechanism, that drives evolution, or is it the 'means' , the 'instrument', the 'tool', by which 'evolution', as a goal, is acheived? If so, then we have to ask, who has 'evolution' as his/its goal, that he/she/it uses the mechanical sorting process falsely labelled 'natural selection' as his/her/its 'means' of attaining it?\n \n As said earlier, the word 'means' does not mean 'cause'. Something that brings about a change is the 'cause' of that change. That 'cause' may employ a medium or instrument to accomplish that change. That is, some other thing that is an implement, medium or tool to that end. Such instruments are 'means', not 'causes'. As darwinists use the word, 'selection', it can (falsely) be viewed as a 'cause' of evolution, but not as a 'means', because means always entails instrumentality, and that always entails something else using a tool to teleleologically achieve a desired end. The word 'means' can only be used legitimately wrt a teleological 'user', or by implication and connotation, the tool/instrument/medium employed teleologically by the user. \n eg., \"I now have 'the means' to buy a house.\", or, \"My car car provides my 'means' of transportation.\", in no way refers to the causes for my buying a house or travelling around. So, again, if \"NS\" is the 'means' for achieving evolution, then who or what does it serve? \"Mother Nature\"? \"Gaia\"? \"The Great Flying Spaghetti Monster\"?\n \n For a fuller understanding of the teleological instrumentality entailed by the noun, 'means', see below, (thanks to answers.com).\n \n \"The noun means has 3 meanings:\n \n Meaning #1: how a result is obtained or an end is achieved\n Synonyms: agency, way\n \n \n Meaning #2: instrumentality used to achieve an end\n \n \n Meaning #3: considerable capital (wealth or income)\n Synonym: substance\n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n One last note--when speaking scientificall and not mystically of 'media' and 'instruments' as 'means to an end', those means are empirically detectectable and definable. They have a definite form, and are in no way nebulous fancies or convenient labels that merely set out indefinite parameters. Another reason why \"Natural Selection\" is not a 'means' in any scientific sense of the term.\n \n Well, that's the semantics class for today. Hopefully the non-darwinists among you understood it. As for the darwinists, we all know that there is no hope of understanding there, since they are incapable of removing their ideological blinders long enough to learn anything.",

Language you realsize is about communication not semantic analysis.\n\n \n **\n You best get some tutoring in reading comprehension. Like so much about Charles Darwin, the title of his famous book is deceptive to the the point of fraudulent. His contemporaries, at least some of those not dedicated to evangelical atheism, soon pointed out to him that they, having actually read the book, could find absolutely nothing in it that explained THE ORIGIN of species, but only their _distribution_. So great was this criticism of his work that Darwin was forced to plagiarize Lamarck and advance \"Pangenesis\" as his theory of biological change over time. Plagiarism and deception always came easily to C. Darwin, esq. Quite the smooth operator, that sly fox.\n \n In the end, it was not ontil after the neo-darwinists had fought and resisted Mendelian inheritance for over 20 yearsa that the staticticians, Fisher, Haldane, and Wright, managed to resurrect Darwin's \"NS\" by hooking it onto Mendel's rising star in what was proclaimed the \"Modern Synthesis\", wherebye random genetic accident was given credit for ORIGINS, with \"NS\" simply a notional 'sorting mechanism' for separating 'the gold from the dross', ex post facto. But even that junk was falling apart by the fifties. Were it not for the clout of evangelical atheists in the halls of academe, where self-righteous mysticism is mistaken for 'science', the entire basis of the darwinian ivory tower, the shambles that is \"RM+NS\", would have been laughed out of class decades ago.\n \n In sum, rather than, as you propose, I have been too stupid to grasp the meaning of the title of Darwin's book, it appears that it is you who have been too stupid to realize that said title did not honestly reflect the contents of that book.
