   "I believe Joe Torre will manage the Yankees next year. It will be their last year in the old stadium. It would not look good to fire Torre. He is a great baseball man and a great manager. He knows how to handle players and the press. It is not Torre's fault that the offense has shut down in the playoffs in recent years. I would wait until 2009 to make Don Mattingly the new Yankee manager.",

   "George Steinbrenner's son says that the offer the Yankees made to Joe Torre was not an insult. But it was! Then Hank brings up that Torre's career was over until his dad hired him. Another insult! Under Joe Torre, the Yankees had their first era of stability since Casey Stengel.\n \n http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/story/7358296\n \n I have had enough of Hank and Hal already",
