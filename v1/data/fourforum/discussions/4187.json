I dont like rulers who kill innocent people like Stalin, Hitler, and george w bush. and I really dont want people to think that I agree with what they do. I do think that anyone who can hold there position on any matter for a period of time, has a knowledge of that situation, and the greater the knowledge, the greater the period of time they can keep controll of it is. \n For instance, the purges seem to have had a good grasp of how to controll the people, and if they knew how to prolong there lives, then they may have kept controll of the people even longer. But stalin was an XXX anyway and I'm glad hes gone.\n\n \n Regardless of whether Stalin was an XXX, you happen to agree with his agenda (maintaining power), or he was personal favorite of yours, the question remains: Was he wise to have purged all those people? I'm confused. It seems like you are saying that he was wise, but you also strenuously objected to that conclusion having been made earlier. Which is it: Was Stalin wise or not?",

   "I tend to model it the same way you do. A thing has a nature and does things based on what that nature is and whatever stimulus is applied. Essentially things are state machines. Typically, I have the name for a thing, before I learn much of anything about its nature. Elements of nature (portions of the state machine) are learned incrementally. I never learn the entire nature (state machine). But hopefully I learn enough anchor points that I can compare and contrast two things. Because of the incremental accrual of data, I tend to view the thing as the doer (filling in the state machine).

Exactly why was it not wise?\n You said: \nwisdom is the amount of knowledge or stored information one has about any specific topic. \n\n If so, then one piece of wisdom is: what mechanisms maintain Stalin's power. I do not see how you can say that it wasn't wise to purge all those people. Since Stalin did maintain power via purges (there's no argument there is there?), purges seem wise according to your definition. You say that they obviously weren't wise. Please explain.\n \n \n As for saying he was wise, Yes he may have been a very smart and wise man. ... \n\n I'm sorry. Perhaps you can see my confusion. We are only discussing Stalin's wisdom with respect to a single point: His purges. I think you maintain that the purges were obviously not wise. Therefore I would think you would conclude that Stalin was unwise in carrying them out. How is that Stalin may have been wise? (Are you talking about some other respect which is not under discussion?

I do not see how your personal feelings enter into this thing. If you say that it is kidney pie, can I rightly conclude that you like kidney pie? Not in the least.

   "You didn't answer my question(s): What frame of reference? Is wisdom dependent upon goals?\n\n \n I have tried to answer your question on frame of reference. Your frame of reference, as I see it, is that a person is defined by what they do. \n \n My frame of reference is that a person does things based on who they are not the other way around. That is the frame of reference that I refer to.\n \n I don't think wisdom is circumstance dependent because it is a quality of the person not the circumstances. It is my position based on previous entries that a person is either wise or unwise regardless of circumstances. A wise person will make wise decisions. Knowlegeable decisions is another matter. One would expect a wise person to know what they know and don't know and seek espertise from those who do know. An unwise person would not. \n \n For instance, I am refinancing my home. I have done a great deal of research into interest rates, long term outcomes, variable verses fixed etc. I also have a good mathematical background so understand many of the basic premises. However, my expertise is neither real estate nor finance. I have friends who have expertise in both. So I consult with them knowing that they know more than I do.\n \n I believe there is a qualiity of humility which leads to wisdom. Those who are not humble, who will not submit themselves to the influence of another are very unwise. The entrust themselves to themselves. They will not go beyond the body of their limited knowledge. The wise person will submit his/her actions to the opinions of others.\n \n That doesn't mean we abdicate responsibility simply that we recognise who we are and how reality is and conform to that rather than fight against it. In my example above the person who thinks they know everything they need to about home financing may find that they know so little that they wind up with a high interest rate or get bamboozled by paying several points (which is just interest paid up front) etc. recognizing the reality that I do not know everything and others do and then seeking guidance is conforming to the reality that I am not all knowing.\n \n That is wisdom.\n \n EF",

This is the first page I found.\n \n http://www.free-cliffnotes.com/data/da/emr155.shtml\n \"Stalin's Purges Soviet Terror Stalin's great purges had a distressing significance during the 1930's. The purges, in effect, started on December 1, 1934 with the murder of Sergei Kirov, a Leningrad party leader. This act, in fact, helped shut 'Russia's window to the West.' These great purges brought on ugly results and severely menaced the Soviet Unions power and future. The purges were designed to expunge any threats of political resistance. 'An important aspect of all Soviet Purges has been elimination of those minor figures whose fate was sealed by the defeat of their prosecutors.' 'Long before the assasination of Kirov in December 1934 Stalin managed by various political maneuvers and violent means to free himself from the control of the party masses.' []The purges were set off on December 1, 1934 with the murder of Sergei Kirov. He was a member of the Politburo, leader of the Leningrad party and had substantial influence in the ruling elite. His concern for the workers in Leningrad earned him popularity. Stalin used his murder as a pretext for launching a broad purge that would claim hundreds of thousands of victims. No part of society was left out of danger by the purges. Anyone who caused the remotest suspicion was expunged and numerous legislatures were enacted to help enforce them. For example, a law that was passed in 1935 lowered the age for responsible criminal behavior. That meant the death penalty could be utilized on children as young as twelve. By 1933 Stalin and supporters were not satisfied with Russia's progress and the purge trials. 'They indicted a whole group of industrailists who were alleged to have hindered technological advance.' The terror is commonly thought to be the mode by which Stalin cinched his own personal power.[] From around 1936 through 1938 Stalin unveiled his Great Terror. The Great Terror consisted of many events including the Purge Trials and the Katyn Massacre. During the purge trials, Stalin once again halted Russian progress. The Purge Trials terminated many military officers and engineers. Approximately between '250,000 to 500,000' Russians died because of Stalin's orders. These trials caused anxiety among the elite's, afraid, for if they opposed they would at length end up dead.\"\n \n \nI dont know that the universe was created by someone and the fact that i believe this is based on faith. \n\n \n If it's just a matter of faith, then why do you make this statement?\n \nThe rules of the universe were designed by someone. . \n\n \n Why should we assume there is something inherent about a higher power in your definition of wisdom if the existence of a higher power is based on faith?\n \n You made the definition under debate.

   "I didn't mean to imply that your lack of knowledge on a subject meant that you couldn't therefore know who did. You said that if you didn't know something, then you should go seek expertise from somebody that does know. I was only asking you: How do you know who knows (once you go looking)? I'm not asking in relation to real estate loans, but in general. Suppose I want to know about god (if you need an example), do I go to a sikh, and moslem, a bhuddist, a hindu, a jane, a hari krishna, or what?\n\n \n Look at their lives. Get to know them intimately. Those that let you see the good and the bad in their lives and let you see how they deal with it are the ones who will likely give you insight into God. \n \n To decide which religion is correct, that is something that comes between you and God. I cannot really answer you very well here. I know many who claim their lives are great because of various things, but it in coming to know them intimately (the deepest parts) I can see what those things are doing for them. This takes time. \n \n \n \n \nHow does trust (even in part) let you know that god knows everything? \n How do you know what his knowledge is?\n How do you know that he has told you anything??\n\n \n An example of the trust issue (cheesy though it is) is stop lights. Lets say someone comes here from another place where they do not have stop lights and have never experienced them; and this person begins driving with a friend. The friend tells them that they can drive through when the light is green. However, it takes an act of trust to get in the car with them knowing they will drive through these lights. The person has told them information, the act of trusting the person is what confirms it in your experieince. Otherwise it is just intellectual assent.\n \n I trust the bible. Why? I have yet to find anything that has led me astray. I don't always trust and act on everything I know to be true, but that is growing to maturity. that is the growing up that comes with learning to trust.\n \n My life has changed. Mostly I don't try to hide who I am, good and bad. I let others see what is not good in me.

How is your verification any better than theirs??\n\n \n All religions except christianity, at thier base, are about reaching God through some act of humans. Christianity is specifically, at the base, about God reaching out to man, knowing that man cannot reach him. Every other religion on the planet is about people being or becoming good enough. Christianity says that we are not good enough and can never be. God in his graciousness and mercy, meets us where we are. There are none other.

   "Look at their lives. Get to know them intimately. Those that let you see the good and the bad in their lives and let you see how they deal with it are the ones who will likely give you insight into God. \n \n To decide which religion is correct, that is something that comes between you and God. I cannot really answer you very well here. I know many who claim their lives are great because of various things, but it in coming to know them intimately (the deepest parts) I can see what those things are doing for them. This takes time. \n\n I'm sorry: You haven't given me much of a method. If it comes down to between one and god, then how does one decide? You said that one should seek the counsel of others, but then you throw your hands up and say in effect that doesn't work (it's between one and god). Can I assume that one really can't determine which other party knows what is correct? If there was a way of determining which other party was correct, one wouldn't need to rely on himself (which is what you are saying it comes down to). Right out of the box, you seem to be saying that your method of seeking counsel is flawed: One can't really determine whether or not the other party knows or not. The question remains: How can one know who is knowledgeable about a topic? Doesn't it really come down to trust, which is a very far cry from knowing? \n \n \n An example of the trust issue (cheesy though it is) is stop lights. Lets say someone comes here from another place where they do not have stop lights and have never experienced them; and this person begins driving with a friend. The friend tells them that they can drive through when the light is green. However, it takes an act of trust to get in the car with them knowing they will drive through these lights. The person has told them information, the act of trusting the person is what confirms it in your experieince. Otherwise it is just intellectual assent. \n \n I trust the bible. Why? I have yet to find anything that has led me astray. I don't always trust and act on everything I know to be true, but that is growing to maturity. that is the growing up that comes with learning to trust.\n \n My life has changed. Mostly I don't try to hide who I am, good and bad. I let others see what is not good in me. I also let them see me changing those things as I trust God and His work in me.\n \n\n I think you have missed the thrust of my point: Trust does not equate to knowledge. The question was: How does trust (even in part) let you know that god knows everything? You may trust that he knows everything, but I don't see that trust producing knowledge; perhaps a deeper trust, but not knowledge. People trust a lot of things. Germans trusted Hitler: That they were a super race, impossible to defeat. They trusted him, and as there victories grew in number, they believed him all the more. Did they at any point KNOW that they were a super race, impossible to defeat? They had faith, not knowledge. Christianity is a matter of faith. You trust the bible. Do you KNOW that the bible is the word of god? Or again, is it a matter of faith? I asked you: How do you know that he has told you anything? Is this also a matter of faith and not knowledge? You have said that you know these things, but I see no justification for saying that it is knowledge. \n \n \n All religions except christianity, at thier base, are about reaching God through some act of humans. Christianity is specifically, at the base, about God reaching out to man, knowing that man cannot reach him. Every other religion on the planet is about people being or becoming good enough.

Chrisitanity is the only religion that not only tells us the way to live, but gives us Jesus and the Holy Spirit so that we actually have the power to live that way. It is unique in these things. \n\n All religions have unique aspects. Hinduism has 100,000 gods or something, does that make it correct? You have not answered the question: How is your verification any better than theirs? You are satisfied; they are satisfied. \n \n \n I have learned from others who know more than I do about what is knowable. \n\n Is this merely trust, or did you know that they knew more? Is it possible that they knew nothing more and were just duped themselves? You claim that I know more than you: Why don't you believe me? \n \n \n I would test what you say (as I did them) against the scripture as only that has been completely reliable. \n \n Other people believe in other scriptures, finding them completely reliable. Why should you prefer your scriptures? Is this just arbitrary? \n \n \n Humans make mistakes. \n\n If so, then is there any chance that you have been mistaken in any regard? For example, is it possible that the bible is not the word of god? If it is not possible that you are mistaken, then suppose a moslem also says that it is not possible that he is mistaken about the koran. One or both of you doesn't know what he is talking about. Why should I believe you? When you say humans make mistakes, are you really saying that other humans make mistakes?\n \n \n As for crashing into the twin towers, yes I think it is wrong. I belive to take the lives of people by people is wrong. \n\n So that is your belief. The hijackers had different beliefs. You think one thing; they think something else. In the face of competing beliefs, who is to say what is wrong? You? Or are you saying now that it was not wrong (but merely your belief)?",

I did not misunderstand you but I do believe you misunderstand me.\n \n Trust does not equate to knowledge. Trust leads to knowledge though. My point is that without trusting, you can never know. You cannot live life without trusting. It is simply impossible. That is how paranoids wind up on medication.\n \n Whether or not something is right or wrong or true or false are not based on whether or not you believe. There is an objective standard. There must be, logically. To simply say there is no right or wrong, is to say that nothing is right. It is also to say that nothing is wrong. I don't think there is anyone on the planet who really believes and lives as if that is true. Those that claim it intellectually will always complain when their \"rights\" are trampled. Same thing with truth. To say there is no absolute truth is a statement that is either absolutely true or absolutely false. If it is absolutely true then it must be absolutely false. It is circular in its very nature.\n \n Therefore, there is an objective standard of right and wrong of true and false that is independent of belief (I have written on this in other threads).\n \n Given that, and this is where I think your question actually lies, who is it that can tell you which is which. Humans, by their nature make mistakes. I think that is one we can both stipulate to. I know of no one that is perfect, do you? Therefore, humans are flawed and are unable to be perfectly true or right. That leaves only something or someone bigger than humans. God for instance. Now you may ask which God is the right God?\n \n The point I was making earlier is watch people that depend upon God (whichever God) and see how they live. Do they have joy in spite of circumstances. Are they merciful, kind, just, gracious, etc?\n \n Islam is an interesting religion in that people die regularly in the name of God. Christianity is the same on this respect. However, in Islam, people die, usually killing those they believe to not know God. In christianity they die trying to love people that do not God that they may come to love God. To be sure there are some that are on both sides in both religions. So you have to talk to God yourself. Because, you see, your trust in God and His consequent action in your life is the only thing that can assure you of who He really is. If I were to say you are saved or not saved, I would be acting in JUDGEMENT. That is the definition of judgement. As another flawed human, judgement is a silly place for me to go. This is why I say you must learn to trust God. A good place is to trust others who know God, which you can tell as you get to know them intimately and how they live their life.\n \n One of the differences between christianity and any other religion is that God comes to save a race that cannot save itself. All others point to the inadequacy of the human and tell us to be better in order to reach God. It is not the uniqueness that is important. It is the method of salvation. You say, how do I know that christianity is the one true one? The base priniciple is how does one reach heaven, nirvana, the seventh plane of enlightenment etc? All other religions essentially have the same path. They say, get better so that you will deserve it. Only christianity says you can never get better enough to deserve it, but God is gracious and gives it as a gift.\n \n EF\n \n PS, I think I am going to have to table things for a while here.

You cannot live life without trusting. It is simply impossible. That is how paranoids wind up on medication. \n \n Once again: How exactly does trust lead to knowledge? I can see that it leads to greater trust, but exactly when does trust turn into knowledge? Suppose I'm a German and I'm told that the Germans are invincible. I have a bit of trust initially, because he's quite persuasive, and well, because I just happen to want to believe him. After each victory/concession I gain more and more trust. By the time France falls, I know the Germans are invincible. Yep. I know it. Could it be that I just believe that I know it? There are simply a great many religious people out there that say they know that their path is the correct one. They can't possibly all know.

Actually, the fact that people are hypocritical only supports my position. People (including people supposedly subscribing to absolute rights and wrongs) want \"justice\" if it's personally beneficial, otherwise not. \n \n \nSame thing with truth. To say there is no absolute truth is a statement that is either absolutely true or absolutely false. If it is absolutely true then it must be absolutely false. It is circular in its very nature. \n \n I happen to believe in absolute truth.

Are they merciful, kind, just, gracious, etc? ? \n \n Your criteria seem arbitrary. Why not zealous, courageous, self-reliant, and disciplined. Why not non-violent, patient, temperate, and thrifty? Why not arrogant, hypocritical, ruthless, and wasteful for that matter? How should I determine what criteria is correct? \n \n \nIslam is an interesting religion in that people die regularly in the name of God. Christianity is the same on this respect.

If this were a reliable way of finding god, there wouldn't be so many religions in the world. I thought this was all a matter of faith. I can't know that god is speaking to me, can I? If I can't know that he is speaking, how can I know what he is saying? Is this all a matter of faith? It seems like one could fool himself into believing something bogus.\n \n \nBecause, you see, your trust in God and His consequent action in your life is the only thing that can assure you of who He really is. \n \n How can one be sure that god is acting in his life? Is this a matter of faith? Again, it seems easy to fool oneself into believing something that is unreal. Other religions believe that god is acting in their lives.

Other people have faith in different gods. \n How do I know who knows god? The criteria you have given earlier seem arbitrary. A warring people may have a war-like god. They would find \"god\" in other warlike people. \n \n \nOne of the differences between christianity and any other religion is that God comes to save a race that cannot save itself.

   "Simply forgot about it. Also still only have a small amount of time and am picking the arguments I most enjoy. Numerous is hardly true. My wife is better. She was in hospital for abot two weeks. \n \n I'm glad your wife is better.\n \n \nI will see if I can explain generally rather than specifically as I do have to go.

Someone can say to you that you have won the lottery, but unless you take your ticket to the lottery office and test out (trust the person telling you) the information, you will never actually know. \n \n \n You know that christianity is correct; somebody else knows that the moslem/hindu/sikh religion is correct. You have experiential knowledge; they have experiential knowledge. (The germans had experiential knowledge that they were invincible, for that matter.) The issue is: How is your experiential knowledge superior to a moslem's? \n \n \nTrue knowledge requires trust. \n \n True knowledge? I'm confused. Is experiential knowledge true knowledge? Experience is only evidence. Evidence is interpreted and conclusions are drawn. For example, I watch the sun rise, float through the sky, set, and rise again the next morning. I conclude from the evidence that the sun is revolving about the earth. I have experiential knowledge that the sun revolves around the earth, but no matter how much evidence I collect, I can never know absolutely that it is so: Either my experience may not be reflective of reality or my interpretation may be wrong. Do you have absolute knowledge regarding anything being discussed here, or is it rather just conjecture based on evidence?\n \n \nYour second paragraph: My only comment here is that doing what is personally convenient precludes justice. \n \n Perhaps you missed the first point. You had made a claim of absolute rights and wrongs and then attempted to substantiate this claim with a statement that people want \"justice\". I am pointing out that your logic doesn't follow. Poor people want to be rich, short people want to be tall, fat people want to be thin. People want all kinds of things, but this does not show there is absolute right and wrong. If you cannot demonstrate that there are absolute rights and wrongs, please just concede.\n \n \nthird: I think I agree with you, but I personally believe that some absolutes have been communicated from the source of right and wrong. But that is another discussion. \n \n Is this a concession that you do not know there are absolute rights and wrongs, but merely your belief? If this a belief (not knowledge), then how is this that you don't know this, but you know other things (god exists, christianity is the one true religion, etc.)? I thought trust leads to knowledge: How is it that trust did not lead to knowledge in this regard? \n \n \nFourth: I think I may have headed down a wrong path on this one. I do think that there is an objective right and wrong. I think one can show that it exists and there are somethings that everyone can agree on as one can easily show that people will demand justice, always, when a loved one is killed. This goes through all societies and cultures. It can include revenge killing and so forth. \n \n You stated earlier: \"there is an objective standard of right and wrong\". Are you no longer sure, but only \"think\"? Are you conceding knowledge of objective standards? If you \"think\" it can be shown that there are objective standards, then show that there are. That people want revenge hardly shows that there is objective right and wrong. Dolphins engage in revenge. What does that prove?\n \n \nFifth: Am I going to tell you how to decide. How, yes, what, no. I think the decision should be one that is tested. Find what you can trust. I think that is true for everyone and could easily be shown, logically. \n \n Moslems/hindus/sikhs trust something. They test it and are satisfied. In order to show that you are not deluded, you need to show exactly how you arrive at knowledge. You say you know; they say they know. You say they are deluded; they say you are deluded. Explain exactly how your process leads to knowledge, while theirs leads to delusion. Every difference you have mentioned seems completely arbitrary. You happened to be raised in a christian culture and indoctrinated by christian thinking/values. They happened to be raised in moslem/hindu/sikh cultures and are indoctrinated likewise. \n \n \n6th: it is pretty obvious which criteria are correct. Even those inclined to evolution would say happiness is obviously better as it leads one to survival. I don't think there is really debate on these points. All of the ones that are good are good to watch. They are not abitrary. See for yourself. \n \n Your stating that it is \"pretty obvious\" which criteria are correct does not make it so. Are you attempting to derail the debate by insinuating that there isn't one? \"Happiness\" is better? I'm not sure what you are arguing. Whether \"happiness\" leads to survival or not seems to be immaterial. Are you suggesting that we should select a religion based upon which religion's members seem most Darwinistically fit? This seems to be contradicted by the bible (that one should die rather than deny christ). At any rate, what guarantee is there that the most joyous have found god? If I do a survey and find that the Hari Krishnas are the most joyous, does that make that path the correct one? I do see for myself: Your criteria are arbitrary. Whether or not all men on earth agree as to what godly traits are, it is still unclear that they are in fact godly traits. People believed that the sun revolved around the earth. What people happen to believe proves nothing. People are stupid. You seem to want it both ways: People are deluded into believing moslem/hindu/sikh religions, but they know what godly traits are. Make up your mind: Don't take the position that they are deluded, and then appeal to their beliefs as a source of meaningful information. \n Once again: You seem to be missing the point of my argument.

   "I'm glad your wife is better.\n \n \n \n You know that christianity is correct; somebody else knows that the moslem/hindu/sikh religion is correct. You have experiential knowledge; they have experiential knowledge. (The germans had experiential knowledge that they were invincible, for that matter.) The issue is: How is your experiential knowledge superior to a moslem's? \n \n \n True knowledge? I'm confused. Is experiential knowledge true knowledge? Experience is only evidence. Evidence is interpreted and conclusions are drawn. For example, I watch the sun rise, float through the sky, set, and rise again the next morning. I conclude from the evidence that the sun is revolving about the earth. I have experiential knowledge that the sun revolves around the earth, but no matter how much evidence I collect, I can never know absolutely that it is so: Either my experience may not be reflective of reality or my interpretation may be wrong. Do you have absolute knowledge regarding anything being discussed here, or is it rather just conjecture based on evidence?\n \n \n Perhaps you missed the first point. You had made a claim of absolute rights and wrongs and then attempted to substantiate this claim with a statement that people want \"justice\". I am pointing out that your logic doesn't follow. Poor people want to be rich, short people want to be tall, fat people want to be thin. People want all kinds of things, but this does not show there is absolute right and wrong. If you cannot demonstrate that there are absolute rights and wrongs, please just concede.\n \n \n Is this a concession that you do not know there are absolute rights and wrongs, but merely your belief? If this a belief (not knowledge), then how is this that you don't know this, but you know other things (god exists, christianity is the one true religion, etc.)? I thought trust leads to knowledge: How is it that trust did not lead to knowledge in this regard? \n \n \n You stated earlier: \"there is an objective standard of right and wrong\". Are you no longer sure, but only \"think\"? Are you conceding knowledge of objective standards? If you \"think\" it can be shown that there are objective standards, then show that there are. That people want revenge hardly shows that there is objective right and wrong. Dolphins engage in revenge. What does that prove?\n \n \n Moslems/hindus/sikhs trust something. They test it and are satisfied. In order to show that you are not deluded, you need to show exactly how you arrive at knowledge. You say you know; they say they know. You say they are deluded; they say you are deluded. Explain exactly how your process leads to knowledge, while theirs leads to delusion. Every difference you have mentioned seems completely arbitrary. You happened to be raised in a christian culture and indoctrinated by christian thinking/values. They happened to be raised in moslem/hindu/sikh cultures and are indoctrinated likewise. \n \n \n Your stating that it is \"pretty obvious\" which criteria are correct does not make it so. Are you attempting to derail the debate by insinuating that there isn't one? \"Happiness\" is better? I'm not sure what you are arguing. Whether \"happiness\" leads to survival or not seems to be immaterial. Are you suggesting that we should select a religion based upon which religion's members seem most Darwinistically fit? This seems to be contradicted by the bible (that one should die rather than deny christ). At any rate, what guarantee is there that the most joyous have found god? If I do a survey and find that the Hari Krishnas are the most joyous, does that make that path the correct one? I do see for myself: Your criteria are arbitrary. Whether or not all men on earth agree as to what godly traits are, it is still unclear that they are in fact godly traits. People believed that the sun revolved around the earth. What people happen to believe proves nothing. People are stupid. You seem to want it both ways: People are deluded into believing moslem/hindu/sikh religions, but they know what godly traits are. Make up your mind: Don't take the position that they are deluded, and then appeal to their beliefs as a source of meaningful information. \n Once again: You seem to be missing the point of my argument. Moslems/hindus/sikhs can all make similar proposals to look at various sets of criteria. A moslem's set of criteria may vary somewhat from yours (totally made up): zealous, courageous, self-reliant, and disciplined. Please distinguish quantitatively how your argument should be accepted and theirs rejected. If you cannot distinguish your position from the analogous position taken by someone of another religion, please just concede.\n\n \n You have not shown that they are analagous. You simply state that they are. I would say that they are not based on the fact that every religion is different.\n \n The point we were arguing is not which religion is right or wrong. The point was on does knowledge require trust. You said it did not, I said it did.\n \n I claimed that wisdom was knowing what is true and then acting in accordance with that. That would actually be topical. I concede nothing. Just because I do not know an answer or choose not to answer does not require concession. This is not a formal debate. I do not have the time to do a formal one.\n \n I have provided much evidence that knowledge, experieintial knowledge, requires some level of trust. At a minimum you must trust the source. Even if you observe something you must trust your own abilities and your own perceptions. If you are peyote, you would not be well advised to do that. If you are on PCP you would be even better advised to do nothing. \n \n Knowledge requires trust.\n \n EF",

   "You have not shown that they are analagous. You simply state that they are. I would say that they are not based on the fact that every religion is different. \n\n Perhaps you are a tad confused: I'm not claiming that religions are analogous, but rather that proponents of differenent religions can advocate mechanisms for selection of whom to trust which are analogous. You have not been able to provide a mechanism for which I cannot provide an equally valid (faulty) analog that yields a different answer. Therefore it would seem that you find the mechanisms analogous even if you don't (consciously) acknowledge it. The fact that every religion is different is essential to their respective proponents' mechanisms being analogous (and not identical). Your logic makes no sense. \n \n \nThe point we were arguing is not which religion is right or wrong. The point was on does knowledge require trust. You said it did not, I said it did. \n\n I did (say knowledge does not require trust)? If I said that, please find the quote. I said that trust does not equate to knowledge. I notice that you failed to address my question regarding the nature of \"true knowledge\". Is it merely \"experiential knowledge\" (what I would call conjecture)? \n \n You seem to have lost the train of this discussion. I'm not arguing what religion is right or wrong. The primary question is how does one know whom to trust in order to be wise (there are also some secondary questions about how do you know god that god knows everything, and what god tells you, and how it is verified-see your #61). In #59, you say:\n \n \nOne would expect a wise person to know what they know and don't know and seek espertise from those who do know. \n\n \n In #62, I ask:\n \nHow do you know who knows (once you go looking)? [] Suppose I want to know about god (if you need an example), do I go to a sikh, and moslem, a bhuddist, a hindu, a jane, a hari krishna, or what?\n\n \n If you can't tell me whom to trust in a way that distinguishes itself from what a moslem/hindu/sikh would analogously say (and come a different conclusion as to who is trustworthy), then I can only conclude that there is no clear mechanism to decide whom to trust. If this is the case, according to you, one can't be knowledgeable (in general), and thus one can't be wise (in general). I submit that your notion of wisdom (in general) does not exist; it is an illusion. I sincerely doubt that one can formulate a mechanism to determine which stock broker, auto mechanic, lawyer, or real estate loan \"expert\" (for that matter) to trust that cannot be countered by an alternate mechanism that is equally valid (i.e., faulty) and yields a different answer.\n \n \nI claimed that wisdom was knowing what is true and then acting in accordance with that. \n\n You have not shown how one can know what is true. I follow your methods of acquiring knowledge (trust and verification) and suddenly I believe every religion and ism on earth. One can always deny (rationalize) the existence of evidence contrary to a given ism or chose to interpret the evidence as supporting. I have supplied you evidence of your delusion, but you will just go into denial. You want to believe that you are being wise, but you are deluded. Your mechanism for choosing what to trust is determined by your indoctrination. \n \n \nThat would actually be topical. I concede nothing. Just because I do not know an answer or choose not to answer does not require concession. This is not a formal debate. I do not have the time to do a formal one. \n\n Of course you concede nothing. If I were having this debate with a moslem, he would also concede nothing. You want to believe what you want to believe; he wants to believe what he wants believes. That you have no footing is immaterial. You can claim just as you do, that just because you lack an answer does not mean that there is no answer. People believed that the sun and planets revolved around the earth. Even after they noted that the outer planets went backward during part of their orbit, people still believed that they revolved around the earth. People don't easily let facts and logic get in the way of a pleasant idea (the earth being the center of the universe). People are stupid. People are so amazingly stupid that they see delusion in other people (like the deluded moslems), but cannot fathom for one second that they are similarly deluded into their beliefs. Amazing. And yet not amazing: Darwin insists on this tremendous level of stupidity.\n \n Whether the debate is formal or not is immaterial. You have no answer in this framework. I do not see how if the framework were changed that you should suddenly be equipped with an answer. It is not the framework that is the problem, but that your position is completely untenable. Your beliefs are a delusion.\n \n \nI have provided much evidence that knowledge, experieintial knowledge, requires some level of trust. At a minimum you must trust the source. Even if you observe something you must trust your own abilities and your own perceptions. If you are peyote, you would not be well advised to do that. If you are on PCP you would be even better advised to do nothing. \n\n The question is: Whom do you trust? The moslem trusts moslem clerics. The hindu trusts hindu priests. The sikh trusts the sihk guru. They all trust. They all develop \"experiential knowledge\". You have not provided a mechanism to determine whom one should trust that cannot be countered by a seemingly equally valid (faulty) mechanism that yields a different answer (as to whom to trust). They were indoctrinated; you were indoctrinated. You know that christianity is correct; they know that their religion is correct. You have no answer as to how your beliefs are better based than theirs. They seemed equally \"wise\" in choosing their religion. If they are deluded, then I can only conclude that you are likewise deluded.\n \n According to you: To be wise one must know what is true. In the objective sense (you believe in objective truth), this largely seems impossible. Therefore, your brand of wisdom is (largely) a delusion.\n \n \nKnowledge requires trust. \n\n Great. Provide a mechanism to select whom one should trust that cannot be countered by another equally valid mechanism that yields a different answer. You cannot do this. \n \n Darwin strongly prefers that we trust those around us: Our parents, extended family, neighbors, teachers, etc. These people believe as they do and have had offspring (or as accepted members of society can likely have offspring). Since one can mate only with people with whom he comes in contact, it behooves one to believe as his contacts do. What those contacts believe may be completely bogus, but at least one will be able to mate (and produce others that believe in that thing which is completely bogus).",
