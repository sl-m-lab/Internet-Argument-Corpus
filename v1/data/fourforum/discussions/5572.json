The arbitrary label of \"surgical procedure\" again has no bearing on the moral differences between the two. Clearly the author was not asking \"what are the surgical differences between these procedures.\"\n The label of \"surgical procedure\" is hardly arbitrary.

Your point?\n I thought someone as expert at divining intent would have gotten my point. My point is that she apparently had the opportunity to go with an abortion and didn't, for some unknown reason. The fact that she tried to kill the child that she previously committed to carry suggests that her decision to carry the child was not fully informed. \n \n Since I'm pro-choice, the fact that she wasn't able to make a decision that she fully supported later in the pregnancy is cause for alarm. I would be equally distressed if she had decided to abort the child and only later found out about the complications that abortion procedures have. A woman should be able to make an informed decision about abortion such that she regrets neither carrying a child to term nor aborting it.",

Yes, she is theoretically as fine as she would have been if she had gone to a clinic (provided she lived, since abortions do have risks in clinics), but that is like saying \"I jumped out of an airplane and landed in a haystack, so I am as fine as I would have been if I had waited to land\" and then state that in this one instance jumping out of the plane was equal to landing. In a sense it is true, but jumping out of a plane is more risky than waiting for it to land to get off, and waiting for it to land is safer.\n \n There is still a difference because the risk is still there even if she beat the odds.
