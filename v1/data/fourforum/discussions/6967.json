   "Since we have a thread on the famous Violinist Argument, I thought I would add some thoughts from Laurence H. Tribe's book \"The Clash of Absolutes\" (a very good read):\n \n \nIn Anglo-American law there is no general duty to give of yourself to rescue another. That may come as a surprise to many; it certainly surprises many law students when they first confront the principle\n\n \n \nThere is only one place in the law where a really significant and intimate sacrifice has been required of anyone in order to save another: the law of abortion. If you woke up with the hypothetical violinist attached to you, the law--and, probably, the views of morality held by most people--would permit you to free yourself of him. When the law prohibits a woman from freeing herself of the fetus inside her, the law appears to work a harsh discrimination against women even if fetuses count as persons\n\n \n To which Cone raised an objection similar to:\n \nOne response is that pregnancy is different from those situations in which we would not ask someone to be a Good Samaritan. The pregnant woman, at least in most cases, 'volunteered' in the sense that she chose to have sex and ran the risk of getting pregnant. Thus, she is not in the same position with regard to the fetus as she would have been with regard to the violinist. This feeling probably plays a significant role in shaping people's views about abortion rights. What the feeling suggests is NOT an argument that because the fetus is an innocent human life, ALL abortion must be prohibited. Rather it suggests an argument, or at least a sentiment, that the woman is 'responsible' for the pregnancy, she loses at least her moral right to claim that its continuation interferes with her autonomy. This sentiment might in turn explain the widespread sense that abortion must be allowed in cases of rape...But the same moral view would seem to require an exception from any ban on abortion not only when the pregnancy resulted from a sex act forced upon a woman but also when it resulted from the failure of a conscientiously used, ordinarily effective means of birth control. \n \n [snip]Does this not suggest that such opponents of abortion come to their views about the immorality of abortion not in response to the voluntary nature of the woman's pregnancy but in response to the voluntary nature of the sexual activity in which she engaged? And does this not in turn suggest that such antiabortion views are driven less by the innocence of the fetus than by the 'supposed' guilt of the woman?\n\n \n This is a part I know Jitobear would agree with:\n \nA ban on abortion imposes truly burdensome duties only on women. Such a ban thus places women, by accident of their biology, in a permanently and irrevocably subordinate position to men\n\n \n \nSociety's willingness to impose on women alone the sacrifice required by laws restricting abortion, unique within the landscape of Anglo-American law, may well reflect a deeply held traditional view of the differences in character of the sexes. While we might not impose selflessness and virtuous behavior on a man....some may find it less of a contradiction to impose such virtue on a woman because of the traditional view of her nature. But to impose virtue on ANY person demeans that person's individual worth. It is no more acceptable when the person is a woman than a man. There should be no 'woman's exception' to our traditional regard for individualism and autonomy. As long as these values remain at the core of our legal system, there is thus a powerful case for the conclusion that laws prohibiting abortion--even IF the fetus is regarded as a person--deny women the equal protection of the laws guaranteed to all by the 14th amendment. And if this is so, then perhaps the Roe decision, by gratuitously insisting that the fetus cannot be deemed a person, needlessly insulted and alienated those for whom the view that the fetus is a person represents a fundamental article of faith or a bedrock personal committment. Perhaps as Yale Law School Dean Guido Calabresi has suggested, the Roe opinion for no good reason said to a large and politically active group \"[y]our metaphysics are not part of our Constitution.\" The Court could have indeed have said: Even if the fetus is a person, our Constitution forbids compelling a woman to carry it for nine months and become a mother\n\n \n Just an add-on and hopefully thought-provoking.\n \n \n[snip]the abortion issue poses constitutional problems not simply for judges but for every federal, state, or local official who must at some point address the issue. Each such official is required to take an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States. Even if the Supreme Court were someday to conclude that judges have no business enforcing constitutional limitations in the abortion area, that conclusion would not relieve other public officials of the burden of deciding what they believe those limitations are. In deciding what laws to vote for or against or what enforcement measures to take, public officials cannot properly avoid considering what they believe the Constitution allows or requires them to do. \n \n Those who either defend or attack the constitutional analysis contained in Roe v. Wade purely in terms of the role judges should or should not play in our system of government are therefore missing much of what is at stake. Of course, Roe v. Wade involved, in part, the question of what the judicial role should be. But that is only part of what it involved. It involved as well the question of what protection, if any, the Constitution, as a document addressed to all officials, extends either to a woman who wishes to terminate her pregnancy or to the fetus, or to both.\n",

I was under the impression that both of you agreed with abortion in the case of rape. I apologize.

Certainly I believe you can morally consign him to death by disconnecting him, so killing him in other ways (such as stabbing him in the back of the neck) are not required to stop him from using your body to live and so would not be moral.\n \n As for ownership, no.

What Tribe is saying, though, is that because of a woman's \"deeply held\" traditionally viewed role it makes it easier to impose the sacrifice of childbirth upon her. It is not necessarily the motivation, just that it is assumed because of the view, which is a deeply held belief, that the woman is subordinate to men and of course she will sacrifice her body to carry the fetus. That makes it easier to go along with banning abortion.",
