A huge number of women give birth at home alone or with no skilled attendant.\n \n \"In most of the developing world, childbirth is a dance with death for both mother and baby, even though 70 percent of those deaths could be prevented,\" said co-author Anne Tinker, director of the organization's Saving Newborn Lives Initiative. \"The secret is really knowledge.\"\n \n The 50-page report released ahead of Mother's Day compiles data from the world's nations as well as the World Health Organization and UNICEF. It presents a bleak look at the challenges pregnant women and newborns face in impoverished countries, where up to 99 percent of deaths occur -- illustrating the wide gap between rich and poor nations.\n \n For instance, 1 in every 5 women in sub-Saharan Africa has lost a baby in the first month of life, along with 1 in every 7 women in South Asia.\n \n Out of 78 low- and middle-income countries examined, Liberia had the highest newborn mortality rate with 65 out of 1,000 babies dying in a country where forced teen marriages are common and many women die during pregnancy or childbirth.\n \n Liberia was closely followed by Afghanistan, Sierra Leone, Iraq, Pakistan and Ivory Coast -- countries known for conflict and widespread violence against women.\n \n In the Afghan village of Rabat north of Kabul, a woman explained that her seventh child, a daughter, died just 14 days after birth two months ago.\n \n \"I am not sure why she died, but she was not able to breast-feed and I was not receiving prenatal medical care,\" said Nagis, who uses one name.\n \n Like all of her children, the baby was delivered at home because there was no female doctor or midwife to aid her at the clinic.\n \n \"It is generally considered as taboo in the community for men to treat women, especially during pregnancy,\" Nagis said.\n \n Dr. Noorullah Moussazai, who runs a local health clinic that recently set up a program using trained midwives, said, \"Consultations by male doctors remain a problem for obstetrical and gynecological procedures.\"\n \n The Save the Children report highlights the need for better education and nutrition among expectant mothers, along with the importance of breast-feeding.\n \n \u00a9 1998-2006 Seattle Post-Intelligencer",

Latvia's rate is 6 per 1,000.\n \n \"We are the wealthiest country in the world, but there are still pockets of our population who are not getting the health care they need,\" said Mary Beth Powers, a reproductive health adviser for the U.S.-based Save the Children, which compiled the rankings based on health data from countries and agencies worldwide.\n \n The U.S. ranking is driven partly by racial and income health care disparities. Among U.S. blacks, there are 9 deaths per 1,000 live births, closer to rates in developing nations than to those in the industrialized world.\n \n \"Every time I see these kinds of statistics, I'm always amazed to see where the United States is because we are a country that prides itself on having such advanced medical care and developing new technology ... and new approaches to treating illness. But at the same time not everybody has access to those new technologies,\" said Dr. Mark Schuster, a Rand Co. researcher and pediatrician with the University of California, Los Angeles.\n \n The Save the Children report, released Monday, comes just a week after publication of another report humbling to the American health care system. That study showed that white, middle-aged Americans are far less healthy than their peers in England, despite U.S. health care spending that is double that in England.\n \n \n In the analysis of global infant mortality, Japan had the lowest newborn death rate, 1.8 per 1,000 and four countries tied for second place with 2 per 1,000 - the Czech Republic, Finland, Iceland and Norway.\n \n Still, it's the impoverished nations that feel the full brunt of infant mortality, since they account for 99 percent of the 4 million annual deaths of babies in their first month. Only about 16,000 of those are in the United States, according to Save the Children.\n \n The highest rates globally were in Africa and South Asia. With a newborn death rate of 65 out of 1,000 live births, Liberia ranked the worst.\n \n In the United States, researchers noted that the population is more racially and economically diverse than many other industrialized countries, making it more challenging to provide culturally appropriate health care.\n \n About half a million U.S. babies are born prematurely each year, data show. African-American babies are twice as likely as white infants to be premature, to have a low birth weight, and to die at birth, according to Save the Children.\n \n The researchers also said lack of national health insurance and short maternity leaves likely contribute to the poor U.S. rankings. Those factors can lead to poor health care before and during pregnancy, increasing risks for premature births and low birth weight, which are the leading causes of newborn death in industrialized countries. Infections are the main culprit in developing nations, the report said.\n \n Other possible factors in the U.S. include teen pregnancies and obesity rates, which both disproportionately affect African-American women and also increase risk for premature births and low birth weights.\n \n In past reports by Save the Children - released ahead of Mother's Day - U.S. mothers' well-being has consistently ranked far ahead of those in developing countries but poorly among industrialized nations. This year the United States tied for last place with the United Kingdom on indicators including mortality risks and contraception use.\n \n While the gaps for infants and mothers contrast sharply with the nation's image as a world leader, Emory University health policy expert Kenneth Thorpe said the numbers are not surprising.\n \n \"Our health care system focuses on providing high-tech services for complicated cases. We do this very well,\" Thorpe said. \"What we do not do is provide basic primary and preventive health care services. We do not pay for these services, and do not have a delivery system that is designed to provide either primary prevention, or adequately treat patients with chronic diseases.\"",
