   "For an accurate view of the foundational principles of 'Democracy in America' you should consult the man who wrote the book on it, literally and figuratively. ALEXIS DE TOCQUEVILLE was the first European scholar to make a critical and exaustive examination of the new commonwealth established in the Western Hemisphere. I strongly suggest if anyone is interested in the true history of the United States and the foundational element of Christianity read the work of an historian who critically examined our republic in its infancy. Notice how he contrasts the postive and moral influence Christianity had here as compared to the despair and misery skeptisim created in his native France:\n \n \"Let us recollect the situation of France seven hundred years ago, when the territory was divided amongst a small number of families, who were the owners of the soil...Soon, however, the political power of the clergy was founded, and began to exert itself: the clergy opened its ranks to all classes, to the poor and the rich, the villain and the lord; equality penetrated into the Government through the Church,\n \n In the United States the sovereign authority is religious ... there is no country in the whole world in which the Christian religion retains a greater influence over the soul of its utility, and of its conformity to human nature, than that its influence is most powerfully...\n \n Religion in America takes no direct part in the government of society, but it must nevertheless be regarded as the foremost of the political institutions of that country... Indeed, it is in this same point of view that the inhabitants of the United States themselves look upon religious belief. I do not know whether all the Americans have a sincere faith in their religion, for who can search the human heart? ...but I am certain that they hold it to be indispensable to the maintenance of republican institutions...\n \n Whilst I was in America, a witness, who happened to be called at the assizes of the county of Chester (State of New York), declared that he did not believe the existence of God, or in the immortality of the soul. The judge refused to admit his evidence, on the ground that the witness had destroyed beforehand all the confidence of the Court in what he was about to say. The newspapers related the fact without any further comment.( The New York \"Spectator\" of August 23, 1831)\n \n There are persons in France who look upon republican institutions as a temporary means of power...When these men attack religious opinions, they obey the dictates of their passions to the prejudice of their interests. Despotism may govern without faith, but liberty cannot...\n \n In France I had almost always seen the spirit of religion and the spirit of freedom pursuing courses diametrically opposed to each other; but in America I found that they were intimately united...they mainly attributed the peaceful dominion of religion in their country to the separation of Church and State. I do not hesitate to affirm that during my stay in America I did not meet with a single individual, of the clergy or of the laity, who was not of the same opinion upon this point...\n \n They are carried away by an imperceptible current which they have not the courage to stem, but which they follow with regret, since it bears them from a faith they love, to a skepticism that plunges them into despair.\n \n (Taken from: DEMOCRACY IN AMERICA BY ALEXIS DE TOCQUEVILLE)\n \n In addition to the this and other works the profound and foundational role of Christian theism can be seen in the work of John Locke. Locke's work on Epistomology 'Concerning Human Understanding' was the most popular Philosophical work in the New England colonies/states in the eighteenth century. Notice how reason and faith are in harmony. This is the 'Law of Nature and Natures God' that is foundational to American democracy. :\n \n \"The state of nature has a law of nature to govern it, which obliges every one; and reason, which is that law, teaches all mankind who will but consult it that, being all equal and independent, no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possesions; for men being all the workmanship of one omnipotent and infinitely wise Maker-all the servants of one sovereign master... (John Locke, The Second Treatise of Government, and A Letter Concerning Toleration)\n \n After Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence and before Madison overseen the drafting of the Constitution of the United States, the two of them worked together on what they both considered to be among their most important accomplishments. Jefferson drafted it, but it was Madison who secured its adoption by the Virginia legislature in 1786. It is still part of modern Virginia's constitution, and it has not only been copied by other states but was also the basis for the First Amendment in the Constitution's Bill of Rights. It was designed to protect religious freedom by seperating it from the corrupting influence of patisan politics. This was to inhance Christianity and its essential moral influence, not attack it the way it is shamlessly attacked in modern times:\n \n \"Whereas Almighty God hath created the mind free; that all attempts to influence it by temporal punishments or burdens, or by civil incapacitations, tend only to beget habits of hypocrisy and meanness, and are a departure from the plan of the Holy author of our religion, who being Lord both of body and mind, yet chose not to propagate it by coercions on either, as it was in his Almighty power to do;...\"\n \n (VIRGINIA STATUTE FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM)",

I have no doubt that some would, especially given today's \"climate\" around Christianity, but I'd guess that given the current \"PC\" environment in Washington, a great many Christians would likely oppose such a sculpture on the basis of tolerance, understanding and equality. We'd most likely end up with some completely non-religious, non-offensive, largely meaningless, modern \"art\" on the front entrance. \n \n Finally, IMHO, it would be just plain unconstitutional. I think that's been decided already.

   "Sorry but you're wrong there...the founding father mostly came from a christian background,\n\n I came from a \"christian background\" and am far from xtian.\n \n \nIn addition to the this and other works the profound and foundational role of Christian theism can be seen in the work of John Locke. Locke's work on Epistomology 'Concerning Human Understanding' was the most popular Philosophical work in the New England colonies/states in the eighteenth century. Notice how reason and faith are in harmony. This is the 'Law of Nature and Natures God' that is foundational to American democracy. :\n\n The bolded phrase is a true gem. :)\n \n \nAfter Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence and before Madison overseen the drafting of the Constitution of the United States, the two of them worked together on what they both considered to be among their most important accomplishments. Jefferson drafted it, but it was Madison who secured its adoption by the Virginia legislature in 1786. It is still part of modern Virginia's constitution, and it has not only been copied by other states but was also the basis for the First Amendment in the Constitution's Bill of Rights. It was designed to protect religious freedom by seperating it from the corrupting influence of patisan politics. This was to inhance Christianity and its essential moral influence, not attack it the way it is shamlessly attacked in modern times:\n\n So the words:\n \" Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof \"\n \n was meant to enhance a particular religion?\n Sounds like it's doing the opposite.\n \n And from the webpage donated by joebrummer:\n \nThe Treaty of Tripoli, passed by the U.S. Senate in 1797, read in part: \"The government of the United States is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion.\" The treaty was written during the Washington administration, and sent to the Senate during the Adams administration. It was read aloud to the Senate, and each Senator received a printed copy. This was the 339th time that a recorded vote was required by the Senate, but only the third time a vote was unanimous (the next time was to honor George Washington). There is no record of any debate or dissension on the treaty. It was reprinted in full in three newspapers - two in Philadelphia, one in New York City. There is no record of public outcry or complaint in subsequent editions of the papers\n\n And a treaty is a legal document.\n \n \nVisit the United States Justice Department at the Supreme Court Building and look above the doors as you climb the steps. You'll see Moses carrying the Ten Commandments.\n \n Look at the doors, you'll see the Ten Commandments carved in.\n \n Why should the Supreme Court br inclined to outlaw the display of the Ten Commandments at county court houses?\n\n It's also got a sculpture of Mohammed on the North Frieze in the courtroom.\n On the south frieze they go through the history of law including\n Menes, Hammurabi, Moses, Solomon, Draco, even Confucious, etc. \n The supreme court does not say that they govern according to any of these \n people's teachings exclusively.\n \n So Moses is just sitting there in between Hammurabi and Solomon with no special significance.\n \n Here, take a virtual tour: http://www.oyez.org/oyez/tour/\n \n Oh, and : http://www.snopes.com/politics/religion/capital.asp",

   "The Treaty of Tripoli, passed by the U.S. Senate in 1797, read in part: \"The government of the United States is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion.\"\n\n \n While the Treaty of Tripoli states that America was not founded as a \"Christian nation\", it only meant that we were not a Christian theocracy. That the vast majority of early Americans were indeed Christian is a matter of historical record. \n \n Anyone who has any doubts about our 18th century Christian heritage can read and enjoy the following Library of Congress weblink:\n \n http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/rel02.html \n \n Some even contend that the majority of the Founding Fathers were deists, and that those who disagree should do a little research. One such person who did their research is the late D.M. Bradford of the University of Dallas, who found that the group included 28 Episcopalians, 8 Presbyterians, 7 Congregationalists, 2 Lutherans, 2 Dutch Reformed believers, 2 Methodists, 2 Roman Catholics, and only 3 deists. And even among the so-called deists, Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin both believed, contrary to strict 18th century deism, that God did intervene in the affairs of men and nations. \n \n Even the United States Supreme Court recognized America as a Christian\n nation. In the case \"Church of the Holy Trinity vs. the United States\"\n (Feb. 29, 1892, US457-458), Justice Josiah Brewer commented, \"We find\n everywhere a clear recognition of the same truth....that we are a Christian\n nation....\" In another Supreme Court Case, \"Zorach vs. Clauson\" (1952,\n US306 307 313), Justice William O. Douglas categorically stated, \"We are a\n religious people and our institutions presuppose a Supreme Being.\" Finally,\n in \"United States vs. Macintosh\" (1931, 283 US 605, 625), Justice George\n Sutherland affirmed that, \"We are a Christian people....according to one\n another the equal right of religious freedom, and acknowledge with reverence\n the duty of obedience to the will of God.\"",

   "In a letter to Thomas Jefferson dated June 28, 1813, John Adams wrote: \"The\n general principles on which the (founding) fathers achieved independence\n were....the general principles of Christianity.\"\n \n Founding father Noah Webster proclaimed much the same message when he said,\"The religion which has introduced civil liberty is the religion of Christ\n and His Apostles....This is genuine Christianity and to this we owe our free\n constitutions of government\" (History of the United States, 1832). \n \n Concerning the outcome of the American Revolution, John Quincy\n Adams said, \"The highest glory won from the American Revolution was this:\n it connected, in one indissoluble bond, the principles of civil government\n with the principles of Christianity.\" \n \n In 1962 the U.S. Supreme Court (Engel v. Vitale) declared that voluntary\n prayer in school was unconstitutional. And in 1963 they took it a step\n further and banned the Bible from being read in our public schools. George\n Washington once remarked, \"If you remove religious principles from the\n schools you are going to lose national morality.\" Benjamin Rush, a signer of\n the Declaration of Independence who was also known as the \"father of public\n schools,\" had this remark: \"The only foundation for a republic\n is...religion. Without it there can be no virtue, and without virtue there\n can be no liberty.\"",

Right? \n \n Convince me, Greg!!!!! :p\n\n \n \n hehe, not sure I can convince someone with their tongue sticking out, of anything :) \n \n As you said, the days of no worries and responsibilty make them the good ole days. I see over on the truck board about how the adults that are now in their mid 20's, say that the 80's just rocked !! and was the best time ever. I personally remember the 80's as pretty much suck central. ...\n \n The 50's 60's were not all THAT good if I recall. Oh, yes, I remember now , the simplicity and slowness of life were indeed fullfilling. The hayrides, popcorn, and spin the bottle nights mmmmm, good. The 55 chevs with the sponge dice and coontail draped areials. The innocence of the times were always in the forefront , while the darker side was elusively kept silent....\n \n I remember all the women in my family having to wait on the side and eat cold food, AFTER the men and children were served first at the dinner table. I remember my older sister making her daughter sit at the table with a plate of runny , green slimy, kale greens on her plate, and my sister making her sit at that table UNTIL she ate them, while we played outside. I remember people of color having to get their food out of the side door of the local restaraunt and sneak away with their heads hung in fear of being caught. I recall the water fountains in the town courthouse marked as \"whites only\". ...\n \n I remember my best friends 42 year old Mom, dying suddenly on a bright sat evening of a simple blood clot in her leg with no warning. I remember my 14 year old brother almost dying from simple appendicitis. I remember all kinds of the local farmers walking around with hooks as hands from mad corn picking machines, hands that could have been sewn back on with todays medical technology...\n \n \n I remember my friend telling me about his older brother getting his bare back getting beat bloody by his father with horse reins , while his religously fanatical father screamed \" I WILL NOT spare the rod !! . I remember young high school girls that got driven off in the middle of the night and taken to secret \"homes\" , because they were going to \"shame\" the family , when their belly start swelling out with child. Peoples unborn grandchildren were either killed or given away never to be seen, just as planned , to save the ole \"so righteous's \" face... \n \n I remember my oldest sister coming to our home one sat. night when I was just 10 years old. She had a broken nose , split lip, and black eye. Her constantly drunken abusive husband had beat her and thrown their 2 year old son out of the window and broke his little arm. There was no \"help\" services back then or laws against abusing women, abused wives just lived in constant fear and pain. I recall vividly that old 49 chevy of her drunken husband that was in chase of her, as he spun in to our drive. As he pounded on our front door , screaming my sister's name, I remember Mom reaching behind the kitchen door, picking up my Dads Belgium double barrel , rabbit eared 12 gauge shotgun, and seeing her drop two rounds of buckshot in it. I remember the look on that bastard's face as she laid both barrels on his chest,. hammers cocked, and told him to leave and never come back NOW !! . That was the only family support services available at that time, ... \n \n Yep, Ron, I remember a lot about the \"good ole days\" but I think after I reviewed this post, hmm, today doesnt seem so bad after all, cheers :)",
