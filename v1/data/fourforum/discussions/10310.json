   "George F. Will has a great Op-Ed on the whirlwind changes in France. Read on: \n \n http://www.buffalonews.com/248/story/152192.html\n \n \n \n France paralyzes itself\n \n George F. Will - Washington Post Writers Group\n Updated: 08/31/07 7:01 AM \n \n \n \n \n \nPARIS - \"We,\" the finance minister says, \"have a terrible past.\" She also says: \"In a way, we've had it too easy.\" Christine Lagarde is correct on both counts. \n \n Her first \"we\" refers to Europe; the second, to France. Both Europe's cataclysms and France's comforts condition the context for reforms. \n \n Lagarde, 51, has a more informed affection for America than anyone who has ever risen so high in this country's government. She was an exchange student at a Washington prep school and a Capitol Hill intern during the Nixon impeachment proceedings. As a partner in a large law firm in Chicago, for several years she lived in, and loved, the most American city. \n \n Today, her challenge is defined by this fact: France's welfare state, which has enabled many to have it \"too easy,\" is incompatible with the welfare of the state, and of society. The government, preoccupied with propitiating dependent groups that it wants to proliferate, \n \n is big but weak. And the welfare state weakens its clients. \"The ethic of work,\" Lagarde says, \"has vanished.\"\n \n \n =snip=\n \n (OK Folks, I'm more than willing to give this place another try emoticon_xgood )\n \n Now, to those who advocate the same nannystate socialism here for the US, here is an example of Conservatism winning the day.",

They also propose a Green Tax to help the environment. The Conservatives in Germany and France are similar in this regard. \n \n Also I may add that the Parties that where in power in Germany and France where more centrist in nature rather than Leftist. I would say a party that is on the Left in Germany is\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Left_%28Germany%29\n \n @jyoshu;\n You assume that GW is conservative, his spending policies seem to say he isn't. ;)",

   "Oh, I think that the French nation shouldn't have elected our current president Nicolas Sarkozy! I don't know what kind of president S&#1081;gol&#1080;ne Royal might be but I'm sure she would not be so emotioned and purblind like Sarkozy. At least she would surely not be supporting Israel in its conflict with Palestine, when Sarkozy is doing it even overmuch actively which certainly irritates Palestinian government and angering Palestinian insurgents. That's exactly why I'm sure that Sarkozy's giving active support to Israel is leading France into a scrape. And I also fear that the French will have to pay a bitter bill for that. It's no laughing matter - the rank of Moslem immigrants in France is the highest one in Europe. New Islamic riots are quite possible here as well as terrorist acts by radical Islamists. Of course, no one can prohibit Sarkozy being a friend of Jewish nation. But I'm sure that in this case he should better position himself as a Jewish friend in Europe. I mean that it would be far safer and more common-sense to turn to countries of the Baltic region like Estonia and Lithuania where fascism is coming to life and anti-Semitic sentiments are re-appearing. I think that's what would be really helpful for Israel and safe for France.",
