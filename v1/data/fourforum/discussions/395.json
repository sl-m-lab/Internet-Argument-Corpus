   "(Some of my figures were wrong. Fixed now.) \n \n I heard the secretary general say if the US takes action now it will be illegal. This is simply not true! \n \n There have been around 300 wars in the time of the UN. Around three had UN backing. Does this mean that we have only had three legal wars in the last fifty years? If that's true why isn't the UN doing something about all these illegal wars? \n \n Clinton didn't get a UN resolution for his massive campaign. It wasn't illegal to go in and take Saddam out then....\n \n This is just part of a growing amount of hypocrisy in the UN. Iraq and Iraq heading the Disarmament Conference? Libya being voted in as head of the Human Rights Commission? Not only that, but the US was kicked off that commission and replaced by Syria. Yes, I did say Syria. \n \n And then there is the Security Counsel. I'm sorry... I don't really want these third world nations, all former European colonies, deciding the security of the world. Why? Because they need money, and whoever gives them more will get their vote. This is not how the Security Counsel should be run.\n \n The French should remember that they did nothing to earn their permanent seat. It was a gift from the US and Britain. If a majority of nations vote on that resolution and they veto... that is the beginning of the end for the UN. \n \n Liberals and conservatives agree... the UN is becoming the Leauge of Nations. 18 resolutions on Iraq, Saddam violates every one of them, and all they want is to give inspectors more time when we know he isn't complying. Absurd. The UN talks, but it does not act, and in these times that is simply unacceptable.\n \n 22 million people have died since the inception of the UN. The UN acted in Vietname and Korea, yet murderous tyrants remained and millions ended up dying just in those areas alone. \n \n Stormin Norman's List of UN Failures:\n Dutch Government resigns as a result of U.N. \"peace-keeping\".\n \n U.N. fails to condemn slavery in Sudan.\n \n The U.N. is even a joke in Sierra Leone.\n \n Where was the U.N. during the massacre in Rwanda in 1994?\n \n Where were they when Mugabe expunged all white farmers from Zimbabwe, and caused a famine that threatens to kill 8 million? Now they are talking with Mugabe about how to avert the disaster. What a joke!\n \n They impede or war in Iraq, claiming diplomacy and inspections are the only answer. At the same time, they refuse to discuss the North Korea's brazen moves.\n \n U.N. ignores more human rights abuses. This time in Iran.\n \n U.N. takes over in East Timor, and then drops the ball leading to further violence and anarchy.\n \n Remember those Buddist statues in Afghanistan that the Taliban destroyed? Well, you guessed it. The U.N. failed to save them.\n \n The U.N. fails to protect those displaced by a civil war in Angola.\n \n That's right. The U.N. failed in Kashmir, too.\n \n The U.N. failed in Somalia.\n \n The U.N. failed in Bosnia.\n \n The U.N. failed in Israel.\n \n The U.N. failed in Columbia.\n \n The U. N. failed in Iraq.",

   "By the way, boycott France! Everyone boycott France! The time has come! \n \n Not only have the French chosen to disagree, they have chosen to rally opposition. The French are only our allies when they need us. Memory fades fast in France. You aren't happy about us liberating countries from brutal dictators? I am so sorry! Hail Hitler, hail the thrid reich. Hope you all know German over there!\n \n \"The Americans\" comes to mind in these times... especially the reference to France which is a big clue. In 1956 we stopped the French franc from collapsing, only to be insulted in the streets of Paris. Memory fades very fast in France. The world is talking about how much they hate America, yet without America the world would be in collapse. \n \n God bless Japan, God bless Great Britain, God bless Austrailia, God bless Eastern Europe.

That's the point of a freaking veto!!! Why have vetos as part of the mechanism of the Security Council and then say the UN is invalid whenever someone vetoes something we want passed? Is the UN Sec. Council only legitimate when it goes along with what we want done? if you are going to promote international law, you have to accept when it comes back to slap you in the face, even when it makes things more difficult for your nation's own self-interests and foreign policy. Same goes for us not participating in the ICC -- we try other people for war crimes but no American can be tried for war crimes??? That's absurd.",
