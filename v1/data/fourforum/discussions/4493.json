   "Unless running significant graphic or calculating software, IMO few people will ever notice the difference. Serious gamers, the upper end of the market for processors/memory and test beds for many high-end systems, seldom choose AMD.\n\n \n We run a lot of pretty serious engineering software, mostly on multiple processor machines. \n \n For single processor machines, it is pretty much a tossup in most categories, since the bus speed of the AMD is lower, but command execution is faster. The two tend to kind of balance each other out. The AMD is usually faster from a practical standpoint, though, because your machine is basically the slave tot he slowest component, and in software with process seperation as bad as windows has, a slow USB application can literally slow down the entire machine.\n \n In multiple processor machines, with the exception of some server configuratyions utilizing the xeon processors and applications specifically designed for them, a multiple processor AMD system is noticably faster than a multiple processor Intel based machine. You are again moving out of windows land here, though, since windows support for multiple processors is pretty bad. \n \n In the end, it probably doesn't really matter one way or the other. If you are using windows, go with the cheapest of the two. If you want to upgrade from windows to a *nix variation, go with a multiple processor AMD setup if you just HAVE to have a 32 bit processor.
