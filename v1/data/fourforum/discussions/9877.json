I suspect that most people who feel their back against the wall in an attempt to defend their religious beliefs are attempting to \"compare\" what is offered in lieu of their belief system. Not that they could or would give an inch but expect to have the opporitunity to retort in some manner with why my belief is better than yours and feel quite disarmed by the statement that \"I am not offering an alternative\". \n They get the impression that since one does not offer an alternative, that they are experiencing an attack for no other reason than the fun of the attack. I have not missed your point however that because no alternative is offered. that as Simone suggested earlier that people need no moral compass such as a bible or the Lord to get through. \n I don't think religion was consciously \"created\". I think it just happened and eventually became the usable tool that it did. The bad, of course getting all the attention. \n The content of your list suggest to me that you, perhaps do not grasp the concept of spiritual. \n I believe that atheism exist due to a self confidence felt by people who have suffered little, never been close to death, rarely been hungry. Not bad people, simply incapable of accepting the idea that something beyond what they can use the normal senses to detect exist. Using the failures of man to exemplify the probability that it does not exist. My confidence exist because I look at God, not people who depend on him spiritually and attempt to represent him. \n The infamous era of European Christianity and the fanatical activity of Islam cast an ugly shadow over what is religion. But, these things are not the will of God. They are the will of people who use powers vested in them by monarchies and happen to be part of a religion, giving them moral authority over their subjects and going on to abuse those powers at the cost of innocent victims for the sake of forced conversion. Conversion, for the sake of plunder and power. \n Atheist are correct in their disdain of people who allow pharasis to blindly lead them about. Political correctness is not a disease limited to the politically left wing of the world. It is suffered by people of religion who allow preachers to be their moral compasses. The Jim Jones of the world as my example. Religions of the world are in the condition they are because people do not seek out God, rather fulfillment offered by the fellowship and guidance of men. \n I know that I have not convinced you of anything, nor am I capable. But, I am recognizing the deserved disdain of atheism of the failures of the religious who have failed miserably in the mission to be a factor for peace and aid to the ailments of the inhabitants of the world. Focusing rather on the building of buildings that cost millions of dollars. While the world around them goes hungry and suffers disease and dies miserable deaths. As they sit in their architectually perfect pews and pretty Sunday suits and go through 20 minutes of guilt trips, pray for 10 minutes and leave feeling cleansed. But these are the failures of men. Not God.",

   "In my view, I think you are confusing, or at least combining issues that I think are separate. As I said before, I feel atheism is different from criticizing religion.\n \n \n\n I believe that atheism exist due to a self confidence felt by people who have suffered little, never been close to death, rarely been hungry. Not bad people, simply incapable of accepting the idea that something beyond what they can use the normal senses to detect exist. Using the failures of man to exemplify the probability that it does not exist. My confidence exist because I look at God, not people who depend on him spiritually and attempt to represent him. \n\n \n I am hearing that it is your opinion that atheists seem to simply have had easier lives and don't need God. I do not know that to be true. If that were the case, you would be saying that God exists because I need him to exist. \n \n Incidentally, I happen to know a great many atheists who have suffered and a great many believers who have had cushy lives. And that statement is, of course, meaningless.\n \n Neither is it necessarily true that atheists are \"simply incapable of accepting the idea that something beyond what they can use the normal senses to detect exist.\" This atheist, at least, is perfectly willing to consider there are a great many things beyond my imperfect perception and knowledge capabilities. Those things are categorized by me as things I don't know. I am perfectly content by not knowing some things. Many of those things I wonder about and am fascinated by, and I don't know why they are. Just because I don't choose to explain them with God doesn't mean I don't think there are things we don't know about yet, if ever.\n \n Are you suggesting that atheists are just more shallow than believers?\n \n I don't believe in God, but not because I lack something like spirituality or wonder or humility. I don't believe in God because the concept doesn't make any sense to my \"god-given\" brain. I have a threshold for which I either believe in something or not, based upon a lifetime of experience, as we all do. God quite simply doesn't meet that threshold. I quite literally do not believe in God for the exact same reason you do not believe in Vishnu or Zeus. Nothing more than that. It has nothing to do with confidence or need. I don't believe because I have determined to the best of my ability that it cannot be true - to the extent that I believe anything else in the world to be true or not. \n \n \n\n \n The infamous era of European Christianity and the fanatical activity of Islam cast an ugly shadow over what is religion. But, these things are not the will of God. They are the will of people who use powers vested in them by monarchies and happen to be part of a religion, giving them moral authority over their subjects and going on to abuse those powers at the cost of innocent victims for the sake of forced conversion. Conversion, for the sake of plunder and power. \n\n \n Religion has a history of good and bad. I think that some of the bad starts by people having beliefs that they would never have in any other aspect of their lives. However, the extent to which religion is bad or good is completely separate from and has absolutely no bearing on whether one is willing to believe in God or not.\n \n \n\n The content of your list suggest to me that you, perhaps do not grasp the concept of spiritual. \n \n\n \n I disagree. Unless being spiritual means believing in God, I can grasp the concept. You were criticizing atheism because it lacked the spiritual. If being spritual means believing in God, you are criticizing one who does not believe in God because he doesn't believe in God.\n \n I think there can be a great deal of spirituality in the wonder and the glory of a pot of purple petunias. One can grasp the marvel and beauty of life and all existence in little things. It may be that our definitions of spirituality differ.",

   "\n 1. In my view, I think you are confusing, or at least combining issues that I think are separate. As I said before, I feel atheism is different from criticizing religion.\n \n 2. I am hearing that it is your opinion that atheists seem to simply have had easier lives and don't need God. I do not know that to be true. If that were the case, you would be saying that God exists because I need him to exist. \n \n 3. Incidentally, I happen to know a great many atheists who have suffered and a great many believers who have had cushy lives. And that statement is, of course, meaningless.\n \n 4. Neither is it necessarily true that atheists are \"simply incapable of accepting the idea that something beyond what they can use the normal senses to detect exist.\" This atheist, at least, is perfectly willing to consider there are a great many things beyond my imperfect perception and knowledge capabilities. Those things are categorized by me as things I don't know. I am perfectly content by not knowing some things. Many of those things I wonder about and am fascinated by, and I don't know why they are. Just because I don't choose to explain them with God doesn't mean I don't think there are things we don't know about yet, if ever.\n 5. Are you suggesting that atheists are just more shallow than believers?\n \n 6. I don't believe in God, but not because I lack something like spirituality or wonder or humility. I don't believe in God because the concept doesn't make any sense to my \"god-given\" brain. I have a threshold for which I either believe in something or not, based upon a lifetime of experience, as we all do. God quite simply doesn't meet that threshold. I quite literally do not believe in God for the exact same reason you do not believe in Vishnu or Zeus. Nothing more than that. It has nothing to do with confidence or need. I don't believe because I have determined to the best of my ability that it cannot be true - to the extent that I believe anything else in the world to be true or not. \n \n 7. Religion has a history of good and bad. I think that some of the bad starts by people having beliefs that they would never have in any other aspect of their lives. However, the extent to which religion is bad or good is completely separate from and has absolutely no bearing on whether one is willing to believe in God or not.\n \n 8. I disagree. Unless being spiritual means believing in God, I can grasp the concept. You were criticizing atheism because it lacked the spiritual. If being spritual means believing in God, you are criticizing one who does not believe in God because he doesn't believe in God.\n 9. I think there can be a great deal of spirituality in the wonder and the glory of a pot of purple petunias. One can grasp the marvel and beauty of life and all existence in little things. It may be that our definitions of spirituality differ.\n\n \n 1. As you say, \"In your view\". \n 2. I don't know any atheist. The only time I encounter them is in political forums. I do not credit man for his faith or lack of or his needs for why God exist. I don't know the reason. \n 3. OK. \n 4. Nor am I attempting to cause you to believe in God. I know it futile. \n 5. Atheist do seem to be obsessed with attempting to dis-prove God and seem to take it personal when they do not succeed. More than \"shallow\" comes to mind. Pompus in most cases. Not all, but often. \n 6. I respect your personal reasons for not believing even if you lack the ability to dis-prove God. And admit that due to my inability to prove God, my belief is a matter of choice. My comment concerning confidence stemmed from a comment someone made concerning the confidence of atheist. \n 7. Yet, those very reasons are used by atheist to disparge religion. \n 8. Was I criticizing? \n 9. this one exemplifies my idea that the concept of spirituality escapes you. \n The visible aspects of a pot and anything in it are \"not\" representative of the spiritual realm.",

   "First, I would like to say that religion seems to appeal to a wide range of people - from the poor to the rich, the uneducated to the well educated. However, I think that different groups take different things from the same religion. My strong impression is that the great majority of religious people pick and choose what to dwell on in their religion and what to ignore, based on their personal hopes and preferences. \n \n I think that some aspects of religion that appeal specifically to the poor include:\n \n 1. It \"levels the playing field\" in that they are considered no less worthy in God's eyes than the richest and most powerful. People are judged by God by their virtue, not by those achievements that benefit only themselves. Indeed, there are many passages in the Bible which seem to make blanket statements against the Rich.\n \n 2. The poor, on average, have less education than the middle class or rich, so they may not have been as exposed to alternate world views - particularly scientific world views from Evolution to Biology, Astronomy, etc. Therefore, they have less reason to question the traditional faith that they might have grown up with.\n \n 3. The cultural climate of the higher Middle Class and rich often is far more accepting and open of those who reject religion than the poor. In some ways, the cultural climate of the poor allows for less difference and less freedom of thought - at least in certain poor communities. In many of these communities, it seems that, if one rejects God, one is considered a bad person. Those who reject God in more wealthy and educated communities may not face the same rejection.",

I suspect you are right on all counts on this one. I do not discuss religion with others unless they bring it up. Most Christians claim to be Christians when asked about it, but rarely mention it unless asked. They seem to be either ashamed or afraid of others knowing. But, I think in most cases they are not studied enough and fear answering incorrectly questions regarding the their religion. \n 3. My use of the word \"incapable\" is I am sure a mistake. \n I suppose \"unwilling\" would be more appropriate. I am not qualified to judge what you are capable of. \n 4. Then, you are the exception. I do not get offended at comments by atheist concerning God. As I stated, my belief is a matter of choice, not evidence. \n I am often at odds with fellow Christians as I believe that the bible is a work written by men \"inspired\" by God, not dictated to. And I do not let the fact that it has been translated numerous times slip by me. I believe that literalist will always embarrass themselves by quoting word for word. Fear, being their quide. Especially concerning time frames and creationism. Christians are defenseless from attack as they are fed verse after verse and refuse to think deeper than the pastor will allow them. I refuse to fall in that catagory. I don't argue against evolution as I suspect it is nothing more than a tool of God's. My most convincing argument concerning God as the designer and creator (at least to me) is supported by the complexity of something taken for granted by us, the human hand, the sensitivity that allows our mind to detect a mustache hair on a tooth. The possibility that these miracles simply fell into place is a bit too much for me to accept. \n 5. I meant that they are not shallow. I know them to be excellent thinkers as they produce many indisputable facts. Never does an atheist offer an opinion without serious thought. \n Pompus, based on reading their comments in forums. Example. I'll just type it as I remember it. Posted recently by one of our fellow 4forum members, \"People who are religious are cripples, using religion as a crutch\".\n I won't argue with the author, it would be pointless. \n 6. I'm afraid that we may have to wait on what comes next to be sure. I know what I mean, as do you. Both speculation.",

   "It's a common observation, often used in jest, that Churches occupy similar niches that said establisments flourish in.\n \n You will often note a kernel of truth that there are often more religious institutions as well as those listed in more impoverished areas. Maybe substituting a gun shop with 'Pawn Shop'.\n \n Upper class environments will seldom have said in their presence. A few churches and maybe a high end hunting/ sporting goods store. You'd be hard pressed to find a predatory lending establishment, or one that seeks to offer fast cash for items. Nor will you find your run of the mill liquor store there either.\n \n Such establishments are typically selling a similar service...hope.\n Hope for a better future or at least an escape from current hardships.\n \n Churches sell that. Give it away for free even if you're not pressured to 'give what you can'.\n Liquor stores sell a quick escape from woes. \n Predatory lending establishments will offer fast cash to deal with a current problem...that you'll pay more for in the long run.\n Pawn shops are similar to the above. The gun (store) aspect is to offer one protection as such individuals congregate in a similar area and a desperate person may target you...they are also the source of a cheap Sat. Night Special for use if you are truely desperate too.\n \n \n I find it odd that no one considers the marketing side of these discussions.\n Advertisements are specifically designed to cater to a certain market that's succeptable to them.\n I've specifically listed the St. Matthew's Church mailing scam. Where as a (totally legal) churchless church sends mailings that have more in common with superstition than religion to targeted areas. Said areas are ofen listed as poor and uneducated. Their newest ventures cater to the Hispanic populations sectors and have a decidely Latino flavor. ie. testimonials with Hispanic names attributed.\n \n How many documentaries/news investigations have been aired by the likes of 60 Minutes, 20/20 and other investigative journalist shows where they actually show the more cynical side of advertisement.\n \n If fast food can be advertised with marketing research done to see how they can get the most profits by use of proper colors, textures and presentations, as well as good use of jingles and other factors that affect the subconscious, the same is done with religion.\n Many evangelical churches of any size have marketing. In doors, they make use of the droning music and skilled oratory to lull you into an alpha state where you become 25 times more succeptable to suggestion.\n \n I am not opposed to religious and spiritual beliefs. I am opposed to how they are often deceptively pushed and used to manipulate people rather than give an honest message and show care. \n But, like the machivellian, they don't trust their fellow man to actually support their message with love out of free will so feel need to manipulate.\n I've heard more stories of the honest man failing in his missionary works when they actually attempted to follow in the footsteps of the Christ (as stated in the bible).\n \n There are even classes that fellow fleecers (erm, pastors) hold on how to get the most out of an offering call.
