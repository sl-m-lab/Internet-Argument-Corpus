It's hidden under a variety of terms such as phenotypic plasticity, developmental plasticity, epigenetics, ermergence, self-organization, etc.....here's one:\n \n \n DNA Is Not Destiny | Genetics | DISCOVER Magazine\n \n To the surprise of scientists, many environmentally induced changes turn out to be heritable. When exposed to predators, Daphnia water fleas grow defensive spines (right). The effect can last for several generations. \n \n so when predators come around, these waterfleas generate new spines -- out of nothing...(unless you count awareness or thought as something.)\n \n here's another:\n \n Induced defenses in response to an invading crab predator: An explanation of historical and geographic phenotypic change\n \n Here, we demonstrate adaptive phenotypic plasticity in prey from geographically separated populations that were reared in the presence of an introduced predator. Marine snails exposed to predatory crab effluent in the field increased shell thickness rapidly compared with controls\n \n another:\n \n http://people.bu.edu/jtouchon/tadpole.htm\n \n Tadpoles reared with caged dragonfly nymphs were significantly smaller (TTL) than tadpoles raised alone or with caged fish, which were not different from one another. Once controlling for differences in total length, nymph-reared tadpoles had shorter bodies and fish-reared tadpoles had thicker tail muscles, than controls. When controlling for variation in tail height, fish-reared tadpoles had a smaller tail patch than controls, and nymph-reared tadpoles had a larger tail patch than controls .\n \n This stuff happens all over and (and in my opinion) has been misinterpreted as \"evolution.\" One cannot tell by an after-the-fact observation whether a said change happened via plasticity or via \"evolution.\" But fish change colors, sizes shapes -- mammals alter their fur color and thickness of fur....tadpoles can alter their tail colors and hatch times....it's all over creation...every animal is adaptive to environmental cues to one degree or another. It's this internal adaptiveness that has been misconstrued as \"evolution\" in the wild. Textbooks still call darwin's finches examples of \"evolution,\" despite the fact that finch beaks get adapted nonrandomly during development via a tweak of the Bmp4 protein ala the mother bird's hormones. My disbelief in evolution has little, if anything to do with my faith in God, it's because I have come to see this internal ability to adapt oneself to his surroundings as the obvious alternative to darwinian selection as the ultimate cause of adaptations.",

It's been a while, though, so that may be out of date. Certainly it fits with the way we train ourselves to do things: when you're learning to drive it's really, really awkward and slow because you're having to consciously decide what to do at any given moment.

This, in turn, is because human psychology is not a science, it is very largely a belief system similar to religion. \n \n Like religion, human psychology has a dark secret at its core - it contains within it a model for correct behavior, although that model is never directly acknowledged. Buried within psychology is a nebulous concept that, if it were to be addressed at all, would be called \"normal behavior.\" But do try to avoid inquiring directly into this normal behavior among psychologists - nothing is so certain to get you diagnosed as having an obsessive disorder. \n \n In the same way that everyone is a sinner in religion's metaphysical playground, everyone is mentally ill in psychology's long, dark hallway - no one is truly \"normal.\" This means everyone needs psychological treatment. This means psychologists and psychiatrists are guaranteed lifetime employment, although that must surely be a coincidence rather than a dark motive. \"\n \n * Is Psychology a Science?\n \n you said you are not a scientist; are you a psychologist?\n \n Of course there is no conflict between science and special creation as long as special creation is not taught to be science. You can believe whatever religious cant you want, just don't try to pass it as scientific truth.\n\n \n I know this is getting OT but you are conflating Clinical Psychology (which is the application of psychological knowledge) with the study of psychology which is very scientific.\n \n The same way that a consultant psychiatrist prescribing drugs to a patient on a (more or less) trail and error basis is not doing science, either.\n \n But (as in psychology) the study of medicine is scientific. \n \n We now return you to your previous channel.",

   "how does this help you? you're saying that the act of picturing the monkey is not a conscious act, but a subconscious act....and? It's still a mental process under the umbrella of \"consciousness.\" Or are you saying there is no decision at all to make a thought? If so, I don't understand that....\n\n It's tricky for us to understand one another, because on the one hand I'm talking in terms of 'mentality' being the operation of the brain, but you're hearing me in terms of mind/brain duality.\n \n The subconscious, as I see it, comprises our automated responses - which we can add to and modify through training. When we learn to walk, the process starts off conscious and is progressively integrated into our subconscious, until we can do it without giving it the slightest thought - at least as far as our conscious mind is concerned. Underneath, our subconscious is busy as hell, moving muscles and keeping us balanced and all the rest of it. It's the same with learning to read: however difficult it is to begin with, it gets to the point where we literally can't look at a word without reading it: the process of recognising the word and linking it with other information in our brain to give it meaning becomes totally automatic.\n \n That's why, when you tell me to picture a monkey riding an elephant, by the time I've understood what you're asking me to do, it's too late for me to make a decision: I've already done it. Don't read this sentence! Oops, too late! See how it works?\n \nLet me give you another example, if I ask you to give me the best route to your house from the airport, you will first have to make a conscious effort to come up with that best route (as there are surely multiple routes to choose from) So...you must first consciously decide whether or not you want to even bother thinking of that best route, and then you must use your brain (neurons) to determine the best one.\n\n Except that \"I've\" already used my brain to understand the question and make the decision. But look, I'm falling into the same dualist trap, talking about using my brain to do something, as if there is some 'me' seperate from my brain.\n \n Here's why dualism doesn't work for me. It's the same reason Wascallywabbit's EAM didn't work for me: if there's a non-physical 'me' capable of understanding things and making decisions and being clever, why on earth would any of the job need to be done by physical neurons and synapses? With EAM, the question was: if DNA isn't the sole repository of the information it embodies - if there is some seperate metaphysical conduit for trait information to pass down from generation to generation - why the hell would we need DNA? It's completely redundant.\n \nSolving mysteries work the same way...you don't solve a mystery because the \"right\" neurons happen to fire -- your brain is like a tool, and you use it as such....it's a mental tool that you manipulate to squeeze out answers...this is done because you have learned to manipulate the electrical impulses (neurons) in your brain. In otherwords, the actions of neurons are not their own causes -- they've been manipulated.\n\n But why would a 'you' like that need such a tool? If there is a seperate, metaphysical 'you' that can learn something as fantastically complicated as how to use a brain, then you clearly don't need a brain in order to learn things! So why have one? It's a self-defeating hypothesis.",

   "I know this is getting OT but you are conflating Clinical Psychology (which is the application of psychological knowledge) with the study of psychology which is very scientific.\n \n The same way that a consultant psychiatrist prescribing drugs to a patient on a (more or less) trail and error basis is not doing science, either.\n \n But (as in psychology) the study of medicine is scientific. \n \n We now return you to your previous channel.\n\n \n Really? Have you asked any hard questions regarding what psychologists believe regarding the deeper questions of the human condition? Here, from the 3 links perspective is an objective critique of this science. Science/Psychology has no way of accurately determining the effect chemical imbalances in the brain have on mental illness in any clinical fashion. Here's an excerpt from the first link.\n Is Mental Illness Really Caused by a Chemical Imbalance??Biology and Mental Illness\n The most honest answer to this questions is \"No one really knows for sure.\" However, this is not an answer your apt to hear very often. On this page, I'll briefly discuss both sides of the issue. First, let me talk briefly about the relationship between biology, mental illness, and emotions. [snip]\n \n Conclusion:\n So what does all of this mean in terms of the causes of mental illness and biology? In the end, it states we don't know for sure what causes mental illness. What a mental health professional believes about these answers will impact the way he or she approaches treatment. If you have strong beliefs in terms of one of these positions, it may be wise to find a therapist who shares your beliefs.Is Mental Illness Really Caused by a Chemical Imbalance??\n \n And this:\n Psychology is the science of mental processes and behavior.\n \n One view of psychology sees the discipline much the way Neil Postman (1992) characterizes it: psychologists are capable of saying with a straight face, and no doubt thinking that they are contributing greatly to scientific knowledge, things like: \"Depression is almost always a factor in the estimated 30,000 suicides in the United States each year.\" Or, \"In two new major studies of depression, researchers have discovered that stressful events--death, divorce or other emotional crisis--may cause otherwise healthy people to develop symptoms of depression as early as a week later.\" These two \"major\" studies \"Tracked the time between stressful events and depressive episodes and found that 60 percent of the first-time depressions were linked to a stressful event.\" \"In those patients considered to be otherwise healthy, more than a quarter became depressed within a week of the event, and the majority reacted by four weeks on average\" (National Institute of Mental Health, cited in \"Everyday life may cause depression,\" by Trisha Gura, Chicago Tribune, printed in the Sacramento Bee, July 31, 1994, p. A8). To many people, it is not news that people get depressed when a loved one dies or when they go through a divorce. This seems to be a matter of \"commonsense\" and no scientific study is needed to verify it.\n \n Another view of psychologists is that they are trained at accredited institutions of higher learning, and must be well-versed in statistics and the logic of scientific experimental methods. Much of the research done by psychologists is as rigorous as that done by anyone in any of the sciences. In fact, it is probably very disconcerting to many young psych majors to discover that they are expected to think logically, understand the manipulation of variables and concepts such as p = 0.05, the necessity of control groups, the placebo effect, standards of deviation, etc. Many of them no doubt got their idea of psychology from the mass media. They think Dr. Joyce Brothers, Dr. Ruth, Shere Hite and the hosts of author/social workers or parapsychologists making the talk show circuit are the \"real\" psychologists. Or they think of speculative philosophers like Freud or Jung as their archetype of The Psychologist. It must be very disappointing to many would-be shrinks to discover that their teachers expect them to think like scientists rather than philosophers or creative writers.psychology\n \n And here we see that Psychologists promote the paranormal. How is this following scientific methodologies when these experiences can't even be tested or independently reproduced?\n Testimonials regarding paranormal experiences are of little use to science because selective thinking and self-deception must be controlled for in scientific observations. Most psychics and dowsers, for example, do not even realize that they need to do controlled tests of their powers to rule out the possibility that they are deceiving themselves. They are satisfied that their experiences provide them with enough positive feedback to justify the belief in their paranormal abilities. Controlled tests of psychics and dowsers would prove once and for all that they are not being selective in their evidence gathering. It is common for such people to remember their apparent successes and ignore or underplay their failures. Controlled tests can also determine whether other factors such as cheating might be involved.\n \n If such testimonials are scientifically worthless, why are they so popular and why are they so convincing? There are several reasons. Testimonials are often vivid and detailed, making them appear credible. They are often made by enthusiastic people who seem trustworthy and honest, and who lack any reason to deceive us. They are often made by people with some semblance of authority, such as those who hold a Ph.D. in psychology or physics. To some extent, testimonials are believable because people want to believe them. Often, one anticipates with hope some new treatment or instruction. One&#8217;s testimonial is given soon after the experience while one&#8217;s mood is still elevated from the desire for a positive outcome. The experience and the testimonial it elicits are given more significance than they deserve.anecdotal (testimonial) evidence\n \n So on what basis beside your personal opinion do you claim that psychology is anything more than a pseudo science which relies on whatever perspective the individual clinician holds rather than any absolute consistent and universal way of determining the specific core cause of any individuals mental illness? Shouldn't a patient be able to choose any of 10 psychologists and be assured that after being diagnosed, they will all come to the same conclusion regarding his specific illness? But you know that isn't the case, so how can you call it a valid science?",

   "... psychology, as that link shows, does not qualify as science...\n\n \n Ouch. This will come as tragic news to the thousands of psychologists currently engaged in scientific research of the human psyche. I suppose in the face of your link's opinion, they will have to hand in their shingles and return their PhDs!\n \n Granted, psychology is still on a less secure footing than biology, chemistry or physics. It is still a science in its infancy. But consider that astrology led to astronomy, and alchemy led to chemistry. Psychology is a lot further along the scientific trail than either. Understandably, because it explores a world vastly more complex than that of an individual atom or chemical reaction, it is fuzzier and less precise. That doesn't mean it is inevitably unscientific. Complex questions such as the human psyche take more time to unravel: that doesn't mean that the effort to unravel them is unscientific.\n \n Just because some self-important twit who publishes a web page likes to sound off against psychologists doesn't invalidate their scientific research, for all that it is more tentative and provisional than in longer established sciences.

All sciences started out at this point, with many theories that will turn out to be far-fetched vying with those that will stand repeated testing.\n \n I haven't argued that psychology is even remotely complete or sufficient. It's cutting edge, wittling away at the vast amount we do not know about the human psyche. The more it whittles, the more we know, but there will be many errors along the way. That is just the nature of science.\n \n So Freud was more wrong than right? So what? How would we know Freud was more wrong than right, if psychology weren't scientifically successful, to some degree? Science cleans up its bad ideas, even if it takes a generation. It's a constant work in progress. \n \n So I am really not impressed by fashionable condemnations of psychology. They remind me of fashionable condemnations of sociobiology, which is now a well-established science.

Its biggest handicap is an ethical one, namely the prohibition against experimentation on humans. \n \n Still, the difficulties in experimentation do not mean it is entirely impossible.

Drugs do often help specific cases, but there's no point in prescribing anti-depressants or other pills unless they do seem to be working. There are few magic bullets, and few simple ailments.\n \n I've had no experience of \"school psychologists\" -- they didn't have any when I was in school. I do take your point about rote prescription of ritalin being ill-advised -- they used to do the same thing with valium, giving it out as if it were sweeties, but not any more. Getting a valium prescription out of a doctor in Britain these days is like pulling teeth. And even when they do give it, they won't give it indefinitely.\n \n I'm sure it's true there are psychologists out there full of too much hubris and too little humility who think they know more than they actually do, but I suspect they aren't representative of the field as a whole -- I've never met any of those, and I've met a few. I also think that the field has been tightening up lately as techniques from outside have been introduced, especially genetic and evolutionary perspectives.
