   "It seems to me that the main draws to various religions are mainly emotional or spiritual ones which don't seem to be sufficiently sattisfied by purely secular world views and societies. My question here is - what specifically are these emotional and/or spiritual draws and how well do the established religions (Christianity mainly, but the discussion is open to other religions) satisfy them?\n \n Some emotional and/or spiritual draws that come to mind include:\n \n 1) The sense of comfort one might have in believing that there is a benevolent omnipotent being that watches over one's fate. \n \n 2) When a loved one dies, there is peace of mind in thinking that they are somehow continuing in a spiritual afterlife - so that they are not completely gone.\n \n 3) The thought of their own non-existence after death seems to be frightening to most people, so a belief in an afterlife is compelling.\n \n 4) In a world that is far too often full of injustice, a concept of justice being dispensed after death is very attractive.\n \n 5) The range of human experiences are ultimately limited both by the societies we live in and by our experienced reality itself. Many feel a draw to believe and be connected to a supernatural that steps beyond the concerns and limitations of the reality they experience.\n \n 6) Religious festivities, services, and social events can add a sense of community that has been partly lost in modern Western society.\n \n Besides the question of which emotional / spiritual needs draw people to religion, there is also the question of how successful they are in satisfying those needs and whether secular world views can also satisfy some of those needs.

   "Some people solve their issues by drinking and doing drugs.\n\n And they continue drinking and doing drugs because drinking and doing drugs does not resolve their concerns - it just lets them escape from them. \n \n I am addressing the question of why the great majority of people continue to hold onto religious beliefs in a world full of so much scientific evidence that disproves many (though it is important to note that not all) those beliefs. My contention is that it is mainly the emotional / spiritual needs, including those I outlined, that draw them.\n \n If you pretend that these needs don't exist, that humans are purely logical creatures and that emotion and spirituality don't matter, then you will get absolutely nowhere in convincing religious believers of your secular views. You have to understand the draw of the opposing viewpoint if you want to have any chance of being convincing in your viewpoint.\n \n As background, I do need to mention that my own world view is mainly a secular one but remains open to the concept of a supernatural. Essentially, I am an agnostic but understand the appeal of religion - many aspects of which also appeal to me. However, though I would find certain religious beliefs appealing, I can claim absolutely no confidence in any religious beliefs without evidence to support them. So... I remain agnostic.",

Point 6 also discusses the social aspects, which I have heard is one of the main draws for people joining the growing evangelical movements. \n \n I don't think that the secular world view is as succcessful in addressing many of these needs and, in some cases, cannot. Where the emotional issues are concerned, all that the secular world view can offer is to give counceling to convince people to detach from various expectations. No doubt that people would still continue to miss their departed loved ones, feel that heinous crimes going unpunished is unfair, and feel uncomfortable with the prospect of death. Secular world counceling might only teach them not to dwell on these problems. So the secular world offers no solutions to these dilemas, it can only help people to be more emotionally accepting of those dilemas remaining unresolved. \n \n Spiritual desires are also something that is hard for the secular world to counter, but it could do a better job than it is currently doing - by truly showing admiration for the nobler aspects of human nature. It is not the noble in nature that get the most admiration in this society. As for the need for community, that is another aspect where the secular world could offer a better solution but falls short.",

I think the draws to religion comes in when the secular world tries to convince them against certain religious beliefs. There, I think that there are a wide range of reactions and general approaches to religion.\n \n Some people will base their world views purely on evidence and will take no leaps of faith.

This is not a fixed position since not all scientific views have rock solid evidence, so how one defines those cracks is somewhat relative. I think that the majority of the people in the US do try to find some level of balance between their acceptance of scientific views and their religious beliefs. The degree to which they compromise on one side of the other depends on a combination of their understanding of either the scientific or the religious arguements, and their predispositions to stress either spiritual/emotional needs, or analytical arguement.\n \n A third group finds the results of science always secondary to religious teaching, assumes that the religious teaching is correct and, if science disagrees, then the scientific findings are simply wrong. Their assumptions will not be disrupted by scientific arguments since their views are not based on reason (at least not secular reason) but on blind faith - which is considered a strong virtue. \n \n I think that the only group one can have any chance of convincing is the middle group that tries to balance their respect for science with their religious beliefs. To be convincing, one needs to educate those who are not familiar with certain solid scientific findings about those findings. For example, it is important to keep teaching people about the scientific findings supporting Evolution and the astronomical findings describing the development of stars, etc. However, one needs to also understand where they are coming from on the religious side, and this thread partly tries to address that. Lastly, it is important to also keep an open mind and listen, discuss and judge without the nastiness that too often happens in these forums. Many people claim spiritual experiences, but if one just dismisses them out of hand, one will equally have one's arguements ignored. One needs to listen to the opposing arguements and to try discuss them not only rationally but respectfully and with an open mind (at least with those people who are open to such discussions). Who knows, within all of the misinterpreted spiritual experiences might actually rest a real one. One will never know unless one keeps an open mind.",

   "I do not want to be argumentative. I do understand that many people get solace from religion, but I think that they are selling themselves short by doing so.

I think the draws to religion comes in when the secular world tries to convince them against certain religious beliefs. There, I think that there are a wide range of reactions and general approaches to religion.\n\n \n If one's religion is not a conscious decision that is a problem. I suppose that that sort of person wafts passively through life and probably does better not thinking about things too much and should just accept what they are told. I would agree that religion would be the only tool they would have to address the difficult issues in life. \n \n \n \nSome people will base their world views purely on evidence and will take no leaps of faith. This world view is the most solid, provable and uncontestible but it loses out on many of the emotional, spiritual and social benefits that religion can offer. \n\n \n Religion has benefits, to be sure, but I think they can be achieved as well or better from a secular point of view. This is my opinion, now, but I just want to make the point that religion is not the only avenue to inner peace. To address your OP: \n \n \n1) The sense of comfort one might have in believing that there is a benevolent omnipotent being that watches over one's fate. \n\n \n I don't find that comforting. I find it creepy and rather parental, putting us into a passive childlike approach to life. Many people use this concept as a reason to avoid addressing problems. God will provide. It becomes particularly problematic in that he doesn't exist. This is merely false hope.\n \n \n2) When a loved one dies, there is peace of mind in thinking that they are somehow continuing in a spiritual afterlife - so that they are not completely gone.\n\n \n The loss of a loved one is devastating. I have lost people very close to me. I can find comfort knowing that his life was well spent and I and the world are better off for having experienced that person. It is the natural order of things, birth, life, death. With memories, no one is ever completely gone. \n \n \n3) The thought of their own non-existence after death seems to be frightening to most people, so a belief in an afterlife is compelling.\n\n \n Oh so true. On the other hand, this can also prevent us from addressing issues in our lives because a better day is a comin'. This has been a tactic used by many a religiously inclined despot to keep the downtrodden from becoming restless. It is perfectly possible to be at peace with the idea that this is the only life we have, and we better not waste it. We feel to compelled to make this life better for all concerned. If I don't live forever, my memory does. I can strive to improve the memory the world will have of me by living well. \n \n \n \n4) In a world that is far too often full of injustice, a concept of justice being dispensed after death is very attractive.\n\n \n I don't find the idea of the dirtbags getting theirs in the end attractive at all. Again this is passive aggressive. Let's address injustice where we can and accept that there still will be unfairness. Life is messy and difficult at times. \n \n \n5) The range of human experiences are ultimately limited both by the societies we live in and by our experienced reality itself. Many feel a draw to believe and be connected to a supernatural that steps beyond the concerns and limitations of the reality they experience.\n\n \n Like many of these \"draws\" this is only true to the extent that we are told there is a supernatural. Kind of a cool thought, but I don't see how that alters my reality. Also, this reality is quite wonderful by itself. Don't get greedy.\n \n \n6) Religious festivities, services, and social events can add a sense of community that has been partly lost in modern Western society.\n\n \n You got me on this one. Community is of the utmost importance to humans. The status quo is these religious communities already exist. There are secular counterparts, but they are much fewer and the comradery and fellowship that is encouraged in religious groups is not commonly there is most secular groups. Doesn't mean it couldn't be, but the religious groups are ready made now. \n \n \n \nOthers do respect the conclusion of science and will try to fit religion within the cracks between scientific knowledge. This is not a fixed position since not all scientific views have rock solid evidence, so how one defines those cracks is somewhat relative. I think that the majority of the people in the US do try to find some level of balance between their acceptance of scientific views and their religious beliefs. The degree to which they compromise on one side of the other depends on a combination of their understanding of either the scientific or the religious arguements, and their predispositions to stress either spiritual/emotional needs, or analytical arguement\n.\n \n This often causes fudging of one side or the other to shoehorn one belief into its imcompatible counter part.\n \n \nA third group finds the results of science always secondary to religious teaching, assumes that the religious teaching is correct and, if science disagrees, then the scientific findings are simply wrong. Their assumptions will not be disrupted by scientific arguments since their views are not based on reason (at least not secular reason) but on blind faith - which is considered a strong virtue. \n\n \n This group gets no respect from me. Blind faith is certainly (and inexplicably to me) considered a virtue and that is a huge problem for humanity.\n \n I guess what I am trying to say is it is understandable what the attraction of religion is. Those needs and fears you talk about are very real, very profoud and universal to humans of all times and places. We need something to help us here, but using ideas that are simply not true can make things worse. Just because a idea brings comfort or gives your life meaning or gives you joy, doesn't necessarily mean it is a good reason to pursue. I submit that belief in that which is not true, in the long run, leads to problems - like dogma, and preachers, and passive, uncritical acceptance of others' commands and not using the reason our wonderful brains are capable of. \n \n I personally have been able to find my peace with all of those conundrums in a secular way. Sure dying still scares me. Sure I miss my dead husband. But I feel I can deal with those issues in a satisfying way without believing myth and reality are the same thing. I am no smarter or cooler or together than the next guy. I am actually a psychological mess much of the time, but I can get through the day without god and I am quite happy on balance.\n \n I will gladly grant you we do not have a mature or prevalent non-religious support system to address these issues, hence the attraction of religion. I think we can and should improve this. \n \n I understand your whole post. I understand the appeal of relgion and how is truly gives life meaning and satisfaction and comfort. If it had no payoff like this, there would be no religion. Who would bother? I am just saying that sacrificing reason and believing in lies is too great a price to pay and that all of these needs can be assuaged with non-religious concepts.",

What are your views?\n\n \n IMO, many, if not most people, whether religious or not, aren't really \"drawn\" there, as much as they simply maintain the beliefs of their parents, or whoever raised (reared?) them. While some change their beliefs later in their teens or adulthood, contrary to their parents, I think most maintain the beliefs they were brought up with. It goes both ways - whatever emotions and desires for truth that causes one to maintain a religion can be comparable to the emotions and desire for truth that causes one to be non religious. \n \n Concerning how successful they are - how can it really be measured? By a religious society's economic (or powerful) standing in the world, or by its relationship with other religions, or non religion within its own society? \n \n Can secular worldviews satisfy religious needs - of course they can.\n \n \n1) The sense of comfort one might have in believing that there is a benevolent omnipotent being that watches over one's fate. \n\n \n Atheists make it clear that they get a sense of comfort in believing there is NO supernatural being watching over them. \n \n \n2) When a loved one dies, there is peace of mind in thinking that they are somehow continuing in a spiritual afterlife - so that they are not completely gone. \n\n \n I can't put myself in the atheist position concerning the death of a loved one, but having been to many Christian funerals including that of my own father 18 years ago, I can assure you that it's no picnic, in spite of the belief in afterlife. Having uncertainty about their spiritual condition could be comparable, if not worse, than an atheists belief in nothingness at death. \n \n \n3) The thought of their own non-existence after death seems to be frightening to most people, so a belief in an afterlife is compelling. \n\n \n Same as above, the uncertainty of Gods judgement could be equally or more frightening than a belief in nothingness. \n \n \n4) In a world that is far too often full of injustice, a concept of justice being dispensed after death is very attractive. \n\n \n Not to me - I can't compare the fleeting few decades of this life to eternity. I honestly don't wish eternal hell (separation from God) on ANYONE. I don't believe it's Gods plan for any of us to have much of an idea how his judgment will go, other than the \"many\" who find destruction, and the \"few\" who find life. (Matthew 7:13,14) It's disturbing to me, but I don't get to make the rules. \n \n I find a supernatural influence in events concerning justice during life on earth to be attractive. I think it's clear to see sometimes, though I often don't understand why things go the way they do. \n \n \n5) The range of human experiences are ultimately limited both by the societies we live in and by our experienced reality itself. Many feel a draw to believe and be connected to a supernatural that steps beyond the concerns and limitations of the reality they experience. \n\n \n Atheists seem to show that they have a comparable belief and connection to what they see as their unlimited ability to understand everything there is to understand, as they look through microscopes and telescopes, etc. \n \n \n6) Religious festivities, services, and social events can add a sense of community that has been partly lost in modern Western society. \n\n \n I don't see that as an \"extra\" that non religious people don't have. They have it in non religious festivities and events, in many sports and other social gatherings sometimes involving alcohol and drugs. Don't you think the comradery among the militant atheists on these forums are examples of a sense of community? \n \n I think many Christians avoid certain social events that they probably would not avoid if they were not Christians. I know I do. \n \n \n Maybe I'm wrong, but I think you are implying that religion is an addition to ones life, over and above that of a non religious person. I don't agree - I believe religion is a worldview that is simply different from that of a non religious person, no more or no less influential in how they live their lives. \n \n So I guess my point is that religion isn't an addition to ones life over and above that of a non religious person, it's a worldview that's different than that of a non religious person. And I think there are a comparable number of \"draws\" for atheism as there are for religion.",

   "Some of the draws of religion are due to things which remain unresolved and difficult for many to cope with far into their adult years. You can't deny that nearly all people experience a strong sense of grief at the death of a loved one, that most people fear death in one way or another, and that most people would be frustrated at the unresolved anger of having someone get away with a heinous crime with no justice done. These are real and adult concerns that the secular world view cannot address as well as religion can. \n \n Whether or not there is any truth behind the resolution that religion offers is another topic - not meant for this thread. The purpose of this thread is to identify those draws to religion and discuss the efficacy of those religious solutions to these human emotional / spiritual needs. \n \n As for secular solutions, some of the human needs (such as the desire for a sense of community) certainly can have secular equivalents. However, issues such as the death of a loved one, unresolved justice, etc. would remain unresolved by a secular world view. That is much of the reason why it does not draw as many converts as the evidence would suggest it should.\n\n \n I think the secular worldview is attempting to resolve them, and is having success at winning converts. The sales of atheist books, and the success of atheist organizations show it. Doesn't the \"who cares\" / \"it doesn't matter\" / \" \" \"purposelessness natural selection\" - seem like an easy alternative to a God who promises to judge?",

   "And they continue drinking and doing drugs because drinking and doing drugs does not resolve their concerns - it just lets them escape from them. \n \n I am addressing the question of why the great majority of people continue to hold onto religious beliefs in a world full of so much scientific evidence that disproves many (though it is important to note that not all) those beliefs. My contention is that it is mainly the emotional / spiritual needs, including those I outlined, that draw them. \n\n \n That's an easy one - basic religious beliefs are far more profound than anything we're ever going to witness in this life. Examples;\n \n Genesis 1:1 - \"In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.\" \n \n John 3:16 - \"For God so loved the world, that gave his one and only son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.\"\n \n Mainstream Christianity believes in Biblical authority. Anything scientific that contradicts the Bible is based on one or more fallible human assumptions. For example, there is NO dating method that is completely free of human assumptions. To question Biblical authority with science is saying that the Bible can't be trusted - not a Christian thing to do. \n \n Many religious people know the difference between science, and scientists. Academic pride and financial interests can conflict with the Bible, but they are easily and often termed \"science\".\n \n \nIf you pretend that these needs don't exist, that humans are purely logical creatures and that emotion and spirituality don't matter, then you will get absolutely nowhere in convincing religious believers of your secular views. \n\n \n I don't agree - I think there is attractiveness in a lack of accountability and responsibility that's found in secularism/ humanism / atheism. \n \n \nYou have to understand the draw of the opposing viewpoint if you want to have any chance of being convincing in your viewpoint.\n \n As background, I do need to mention that my own world view is mainly a secular one but remains open to the concept of a supernatural. Essentially, I am an agnostic but understand the appeal of religion - many aspects of which also appeal to me. However, though I would find certain religious beliefs appealing, I can claim absolutely no confidence in any religious beliefs without evidence to support them. So... I remain agnostic.\n\n \n Was that the views of your parents? \n \n My views are similar to those of my parents, combined with an outside political event which reinforced them. I was 9 years old in 1963 when Madlyn Murray O'hair was in the news concerning the banning of prayer in public schools, and without any outside influence, (even from my parents) I thought she was the most disgusting, nasty old bag I had ever laid eyes on. Do you suppose something like that is an important \"draw\" to separate ones self from a certain famous person from another belief? I do - I think many atheists believe the way they do simply because of a negative influence of someone like questionable televangelists - Bakker or Swaggart for example. Or even Billy Graham, who may have turned a few people off with his style of presentation. Do you think a negativity towards certain \"representatives\" of Christianity, (or atheism), are profound \"draws\" for the opposing viewpoint?",

   "Anything scientific that contradicts the Bible is based on one or more fallible human assumptions.\n\n It's an assumption that light comes from the sun? Science is based on observation, not assumption.\n \n \nFor example, there is NO dating method that is completely free of human assumptions.\n\n Isochron dating requires no assumptions.\n Do you think that counting tree rings requires any more assumptions than you make in normal, everyday life without questioning?\n \n \nTo question Biblical authority with science is saying that the Bible can't be trusted - not a Christian thing to do.\n\n So NOT being blindly ignorant is an un-Christian thing to do?\n \n \nMany religious people know the difference between science, and scientists. Academic pride and financial interests can conflict with the Bible, but they are easily and often termed \"science\".\n\n Science with no financial interests conflict with the Bible all the time. You remember that Darwin was a Christian with nobody to impress when he realized that natural selection explained the observations about nature that he made and sat on his work for years and years instead of rushing to press to make a fortune?\n \n \nI think there is attractiveness in a lack of accountability and responsibility that's found in secularism/ humanism / atheism.\n\n How would you possibly know what secularism promotes? You may find the idea of no accountability and no responsibility attractive, but there are no such concepts inherent within secularism, humanism, or atheism. (In fact, if you'd go back and read the Humanist Manifesto you're always so happy to try to spin, you'll see that you're just plain wrong.)\n \n \nI was 9 years old in 1963 when Madlyn Murray O'hair was in the news concerning the banning of prayer in public schools, and without any outside influence, (even from my parents) I thought she was the most disgusting, nasty old bag I had ever laid eyes on.

Or even Billy Graham, who may have turned a few people off with his style of presentation.\n\n I doubt that most atheists are atheists for those reasons. They're atheists because they've realized that being a Christian requires a willful suspension of logic and the link to reality. Now, I can't see how having hacks like Bakker and Popoff exposed for the frauds they are, or seeing that \"men of God\" are molesting boys and being protected by the church, or realizing that the Bible is full of absurdities, atrocities, and contradictions can possibly help.\n \n \nDo you think a negativity towards certain \"representatives\" of Christianity, (or atheism), are profound \"draws\" for the opposing viewpoint?\n\n To an extent, cliques immunize themselves against internal negativity. Take Ted Haggard: uber-Republican, anti-gay, pro-righteousness, and busted for buying meth with intent to use and for having a homosexual relationship with a male prostitute. Yet virtually all of his megachurch followers still love him instead of viewing him as the hypocritical, adulterous fraud that he is.

For those people who have claimed certain religious experiences, I can understand that they would think that this evidence supports their belief.

   "IMO, many, if not most people, whether religious or not, aren't really \"drawn\" there, as much as they simply maintain the beliefs of their parents, or whoever raised (reared?) them. While some change their beliefs later in their teens or adulthood, contrary to their parents, I think most maintain the beliefs they were brought up with. It goes both ways - whatever emotions and desires for truth that causes one to maintain a religion can be comparable to the emotions and desire for truth that causes one to be non religious. \n\n I would agree that most people hold to a religion because that is what they grew up with. I would think that part of it is simply the trend to stick with what is most familiar, but it also takes a certain amount of intellectual courage to move away from accepted family and community tradition for reasons other than simply rebeliousness. There is also the guilt or fear factors that many religions instill in their followers. I will admit myself to a residual emotional guilt factor associated with largely moving away from the moderate Roman Catholic beliefs that I grew up with. Nevertheless, despite tradition, familiarity and the fear or guilt associated with the thought of leaving a religion, many people do question their religion and this thread tries to address some of the reasons that most remain drawn to it nonetheless.\n \nAtheists make it clear that they get a sense of comfort in believing there is NO supernatural being watching over them. \n\n Many people who are otherwise nonbelievers get drawn to belief in times of crisis, when life's events spiral out of their control. Then, the thought of a benevolent God watching over them is a draw. Many also take on religion near the end of their lives when fear of death starts making them wonder about spirituality. This by no means happens to all nonbelievers, but it happens to many. Atheists that hold strong views against the existence of the supernatural find other ways of dealing with crisis situations or the concept of their eminent demise at the end of their lives. \n \n Also, despite the potentially positive aspects, there is also an aspect of the idea of having God watching over one that is unappealing to many, including myself. Nobody likes being judged so the thought of a being constantly judging you is not particularly appealing.\n \nI can't put myself in the atheist position concerning the death of a loved one, but having been to many Christian funerals including that of my own father 18 years ago, I can assure you that it's no picnic, in spite of the belief in afterlife. Having uncertainty about their spiritual condition could be comparable, if not worse, than an atheists belief in nothingness at death. \n\n That's a good point - especially for those religions for which the criteria for entrance into heaven is much stricter. The mild version of Roman Catholicism that I grew up with was very far from being fire-and-brimstone in its rhethoric. Hell was almost never mentioned so presumably most people just assumed that - unless they murdered someone, etc. - they would go to heaven.\n \nNot to me - I can't compare the fleeting few decades of this life to eternity. I honestly don't wish eternal hell (separation from God) on ANYONE. I don't believe it's Gods plan for any of us to have much of an idea how his judgment will go, other than the \"many\" who find destruction, and the \"few\" who find life. (Matthew 7:13,14) It's disturbing to me, but I don't get to make the rules. \n\n I am glad you brought up this point. This is one of the reasons why I titled the thread \"How well does religion satisfy emotional and spiritual needs?\". Personally, the idea that a crime that someone comits in life would lead to eternal suffering seems extremely unjust and unworthy of a hypothetically benevolent God. It sattisfies some people's blood lust in letting them imagine the suffering of one who purposely wrongs others, but perpetual punishment assumes that people are incapable of change. Justice is not the same as vengeance - where it seems that the religious concept of hell is mainly cosmic vengeance, not justice. This aspect would get a \"C-\" in my view in how it satisfies that sense of justice. Granted, I also do not get to make the rules but I do get to decide what to believe and what not to believe and, unless there is any evidence for such a hell, I have no reason to believe it. \n \nAtheists seem to show that they have a comparable belief and connection to what they see as their unlimited ability to understand everything there is to understand, as they look through microscopes and telescopes, etc. \n\n I can state with 100% certainty, as a physicist as well, that we will never know EVERYTHING there is to know. We will gain more and more knowledge on those things which are measurable or repeatable, but there are some things that we can no longer measure (such as the beginning of the universe) and which we have to make educated guesses on based on the limited evidence that does still exist. Nevertheless, part of the draw to a supernatural is not only in trying to understand all that happens to people (the great majority of which science has been able to answer or soon will) but to participate in a spiritual existence in which noble aspects of character are rewarded and valued - which is far-too-lacking in the everyday world we live in. Lastly, the thought that people themselves can take on some \"god-like\" characteristics - from the state of expansion of mind involved in Nirvahna, to the idea of living forever - is appealing to many. \n \nI don't see that as an \"extra\" that non religious people don't have. They have it in non religious festivities and events, in many sports and other social gatherings sometimes involving alcohol and drugs. Don't you think the comradery among the militant atheists on these forums are examples of a sense of community?\n \n I think many Christians avoid certain social events that they probably would not avoid if they were not Christians. I know I do.\n\n Some people feel no draw to larger scale social events, but many do, and the secular world does not really currently offer enough of these. I suspect that, in many of these Christian social events, many people go out of their way to be friendly to strangers coming in, where this is not true for most secular social events. That can be a large draw for many, where the Evangelical movements have benefited from that. I am not saying that the secular world cannot offer alternatives, it is just that the alternatives that do exist are, for the most part, lacking in many aspects that do attract people to the Christian events.\n \nMaybe I'm wrong, but I think you are implying that religion is an addition to ones life, over and above that of a non religious person. I don't agree - I believe religion is a worldview that is simply different from that of a non religious person, no more or no less influential in how they live their lives. \n\n I think that there are some things that religion offers which don't have nearly as sattisfying alternatives for those who are not religious. That does not mean that firm non-believers will become religious because of those unsattisfactory alternatives, but the draws certainly could sway people who are uncertain about whether or not to hold onto various religious beliefs. \n \n I think that solid atheists tend to run in two molds - one which simply will not allow for belief in anything that does not show solid evidence of itself, and another which is an angry reaction against the rhethoric and political involvement of various established religions. However, solid atheists form a minority of non-believers, just as those who strictly follow all aspects of religious dogma also form a minority of believers. Judging from the polls on various issues, most people appear to find themselves in that grey spectrum in between where their religious beliefs are not blind and are mixed with other considerations. I think those are the people who are most affected by the positives and negatives of various religious beliefs.",

For whatever unknown reason, God allows his adversary, Satan, to exist and have power in this world. God is often blamed for Satan's actions. \n \n If there were no God, I don't think we would have the stark contrast between good and evil that we have. I believe militant atheists like O'Hair, Hitchens, Dawkins, and Stenger have a source for their militance. I just held my nose, used my 40% off coupon, and bought Stenger's book \"How science shows that God does not exist\". As I get time, I'm looking forward to comparing it to Kenneth Miller's \"Finding Darwin's God, and noting the differences in scientific interpretation. \n \n \n \nI can state with 100% certainty, as a physicist as well, that we will never know EVERYTHING there is to know.

It tries to with the presupposition that there is no supernatural plan. Christianity believes there is ONE perfect plan. There will always be a divide in what science claims to understand, and what Christians understand from a belief in self authenticating and self attesting scripture, interpreting it with itself, not with human imperfection from the outside. The \"god-like\" characteristics that you speak of, contrasted with Christian beliefs and accountability, are what I believe causes so much political strife - what causes people to line up on two opposing sides on so many public issues. There are patterns, it happens too often to be coincidence, yet it is too uncontrolled to be a plot. \n \n \nSome people feel no draw to larger scale social events, but many do, and the secular world does not really currently offer enough of these.

There are many small churches in my area that struggle for existence - I'm a member of one. They desperately try new ideas for social events, and attendance is low. Bars and riverboat casinos in my area seem to always do a good business. \"Lions clubs\" in my area seem to be very friendly. \n \n \nI think that there are some things that religion offers which don't have nearly as sattisfying alternatives for those who are not religious.

   "\"As for those who protest that I am robbing people of the great comfort and consolation they gain from Christianity, I can only say that Christianity includes hell, eternal torture for the vast majority of humanity, for most of your relatives and friends. Christianity includes a devil who is really more powerful than God, and who keeps gathering into his furnaces most of the creatures whom God turns out and for whom he sent his son to the cross in vain.

   "I agree, but the worldview of atheism also has a factor that it instills, the intelligence factor, and it also has guilt and fear, particularly on college campuses. A lack of religion is often \"in\", in 21st century education. The word \"atheist\" continues to have a certain undesirable stigma attached to it, and efforts are being made to overcome that by a few prominent atheists, by replacing it with the word \"bright\".\n\n This is the first time that I have heard the word \"bright\" used in that context so I would agree with electrolyte that, if it had been introduced at some point, it didn't catch on. That being said, I agree that there is a stigma in certain atheist circles attached with having any belief at all. However, I would stress a big difference between atheism and agnosticism, as those terms are commonly used. Most people I have met who do not claim a religious belief classify themselves as agnostic (and this includes myself) since they cannot be certain either way. Most, as I, will not take a blind and confident leap of faith into religious or supernatural belief since the evidence is just not there. However, we also acknowledge that one cannot disprove the existence of a supernatural - just limit any apparent role any hypothetical supernatural might have based on the evidence at hand. Thus, though they, along with Atheists, do not accept the truth of established religions, Agnostics tend to be far more open-minded in accepting the possible existence of a supernatural of some form. We do not claim that a supernatural exists but neither do we absolutely deny that it can.\n \nI agree, but you and I probably disagree on where that draw comes from. I don't believe that draw comes from random earthly events, I believe it comes from a supernatural revelation that humans need God. It shouldn't be hard for any human to see that perfection is not in them. It should be easy for anyone to see several times each and every day. \n\n That is one of the draws that I mentioned in my opening post - \"5) The range of human experiences are ultimately limited both by the societies we live in and by our experienced reality itself. Many feel a draw to believe and be connected to a supernatural that steps beyond the concerns and limitations of the reality they experience.\" However, I think that the other draws do play a large role as well.\n \nNobody likes being judged by imperfect humans. I see evidence that people who don't know God, who don't seek him, tend to place him in a human realm. \n\n Even if one is judged by a perfect being, it still adds the stress factor of having to constantly be on one's guard. We all allow ourselves self-indulgences and imperfect behaviors every so often. The potential guilt trip accompanying the thought that all of these acts are judged would not be a good experience. \n \nThat's a big problem in the Christian religion - differing viewpoints on what is required for salvation. I'm a Lutheran, and Martin Luther's main disagreement with the Catholic church concerned works vs grace. What is required for salvation? My belief, ~nothing~ it has already been done on the cross. But no free gift can be enjoyed by someone who rejects it. \n\n Does that mean that, in your belief system, everyone who believes in God (even if their actual behavior is vile) will go to heaven while anyone who does not believe in God (even if they were brought up with a different belief system and are wonderful human beings - such as Gandhi) go to hell? I'm afraid that, in my book, such a belief would warrant a \"D\" in the criteria of how well it satisfies emotional and spiritual needs since it is very unjust. I cannot view any hypothetical God as judging people purely on their loyalty - that seems like far too petty a characteristic for a benevolent, all-knowing God - too HUMAN a characteristic, in the worst sense of the word. \n \nI think there is a weakness in Christianity in how it is often presented to those who weren't trained into its teachings at an early age. For whatever unknown reason, God allows his adversary, Satan, to exist and have power in this world. God is often blamed for Satan's actions. \n \n If there were no God, I don't think we would have the stark contrast between good and evil that we have. I believe militant atheists like O'Hair, Hitchens, Dawkins, and Stenger have a source for their militance. I just held my nose, used my 40% off coupon, and bought Stenger's book \"How science shows that God does not exist\". As I get time, I'm looking forward to comparing it to Kenneth Miller's \"Finding Darwin's God, and noting the differences in scientific interpretation. \n\n To be honest, even from a young age when I was still part of the Roman Catholic faith, I never did place much credence in the existence of Satan. It seemed like such a \"cop out\"- blaming a supernatural being for the evil behavior of man, which can be mainly explained by a combination of greed, lust for power, and the ability of too many people to shut off their sense of empathy when it suits them. A belief in Satan also never made sense to me. Christianity claims to be monotheistic, so anything that a Satan is able to do would be done with the indirect permission of God, since Satan apparently does not have his own independent power but essentially borrows it from God. I can see some sense to the story if one claims that Satan only acts on Earth - where God might allow for evil acts in order to test people (though that in itself brings a lot of problems - innocent children dying, etc.). However, it makes even less sense to me for there to be a belief that Satan can take souls to a hell for infinite time without the permission of God. What possible good could come from that? Essentially, a belief in Satan has warranted an \"F\" for me in the sense of any such belief being in the least bit emotionally or spiritually satisfying.\n \nThe more knowledge we gain on measurable and repeatable things will be negligible, concerning the choice between atheism and religion. We're never going to be able to go back in time. \n \n I don't think science can answer it. It tries to with the presupposition that there is no supernatural plan. Christianity believes there is ONE perfect plan. There will always be a divide in what science claims to understand, and what Christians understand from a belief in self authenticating and self attesting scripture, interpreting it with itself, not with human imperfection from the outside. \n\n Science itself does not automatically exclude the supernatural on principle. It simply follows paths spelled out for it by evidence. If a supernatural would show clear and irrefutable evidence of itself, then I am sure that many scientists would excitedly jump aboard and analyze that evidence to death and explore that new exciting proven direction of existence. (If you deny this, then you could even try holding a poll in this forum). Unfortunately, any evidence that people do try to present has been poor, judging by the usual standards of scientific evidence. This has happened so often that I would agree that scientists rarely if ever even explore the possibility of a supernatural. It has led to too many dead-ends so the general assumption is that it does not exist.\n \n The \"god-like\" characteristics that you speak of, contrasted with Christian beliefs and accountability, are what I believe causes so much political strife - what causes people to line up on two opposing sides on so many public issues. There are patterns, it happens too often to be coincidence, yet it is too uncontrolled to be a plot.\n\n I'm not really following you here. Could you elaborate?",

Science does try to find some underlying structure behind the events or characteristics it is observing. \n \n Regarding any potential evidence of a hypothetical supernatural, I think that, if it showed evidence of itself through measurement or observation and if it had some underlying structure, then I think that science could study it. For example, if some hypothetical evidence would be found for something like E.S.P. and there were observable and/or repeatably measurable trends and structure behind it that could be analyzed, then that could be studied as a scientific discipline. Don't you agree? Until any such evidence presents itself, we stay with the assumption that it does not exist, but if such evidence did present itself then we would have to eventually accept its reality and study it as best we could. I would think that any such study would have to fall under the general category of Science.",

   "This is the first time that I have heard the word \"bright\" used in that context so I would agree with electrolyte that, if it had been introduced at some point, it didn't catch on. \n\n \n I don't think the book is officially closed on it. When I was growing up in the 60's, the word \"gay\" was a pleasant, uncontroversial word. It wasn't changed to represent homosexuality overnight, but it did happen. My point is, that there may not be a tremendous difference in a factor that religion instills, vs a factor that atheism instills. And that maybe atheism is progressing into something that is more passionately opposing religion, making it more similar to religion. Religion that the US Constitution does not permit to be established. \n \n \n That being said, I agree that there is a stigma in certain atheist circles attached with having any belief at all. However, I would stress a big difference between atheism and agnosticism, as those terms are commonly used. Most people I have met who do not claim a religious belief classify themselves as agnostic (and this includes myself) since they cannot be certain either way.

We do not claim that a supernatural exists but neither do we absolutely deny that it can. \n\n \n \n I don't think agnosticism is an absolute 50/50 neutral viewpoint. Wikipedia has a pretty good read on it. This one sentence jumped out at me;\n \n \nAs a nickname the term \"agnostic\" was soon misused to cover any and every variation of skepticism. \n\n \n \"Darwin's bulldog\", Thomas Huxley invented the term. His belief was that the supernatural was unknown and unknowable, but his forwarding of Darwin's theory did what you put into words nicely, it attempted to limit \"any apparent role any supernatural might have\", not only in science, but in societal decisions. That's hardly innocent neutrality. I have noticed at least one, and possibly more posters here at these forums declare themselves agnostics, yet attack religion in a way that doesn't separate themselves from atheists in any noticable way. Proof of the truth of the above Wikipedia statement about variation is made clear when David Horowitz claims to be an agnostic. (You remember him - the ABOR guy) No question that there is very little similarity in his worldview vs the worldview of modern day Thomas Huxleys. Bottom line - the term covers too much variation, and is an indicator that there is very little neutrality between Christianity and atheism, concerning political decisions in the western world. \n \n \nEven if one is judged by a perfect being, it still adds the stress factor of having to constantly be on one's guard. We all allow ourselves self-indulgences and imperfect behaviors every so often. The potential guilt trip accompanying the thought that all of these acts are judged would not be a good experience. \n\n \n Is that stress factor completely gone in agnosticism? Or is it also there somewhat, maybe even comparable to Christianity? I even suspect there may be traces of it in atheism as well. Atheism seems to seek comfort in science, implying that it's the only source of knowledge. It's not. \n \n \nDoes that mean that, in your belief system, everyone who believes in God (even if their actual behavior is vile) will go to heaven while anyone who does not believe in God (even if they were brought up with a different belief system and are wonderful human beings - such as Gandhi) go to hell? \n\n \n Basically, yes. (replacing your word \"God\" with the name \"Jesus Christ\".) But any specifics of it are not for humans to know. (Judge not, lest thou be judged - Matthew 7:1) I suppose those who sincerely believe in Christ and make lots of mistakes could be different than one who claims a belief, but isn't sincere. Different belief systems, with absolutely no exposure to Christianity - I don't believe we can know how they will be judged. I do know, (and this may not be a very Christian promoting thing to say) that not a single one of us asked to be born. I don't think God is going to be as hard to get along with concerning judgment as Satan wants us to think. \n \n \nI'm afraid that, in my book, such a belief would warrant a \"D\" in the criteria of how well it satisfies emotional and spiritual needs since it is very unjust. I cannot view any hypothetical God as judging people purely on their loyalty - that seems like far too petty a characteristic for a benevolent, all-knowing God - too HUMAN a characteristic, in the worst sense of the word. \n\n \n Noted, but remember that has nothing to do with any advancement in scientific or human knowledge since......the founding of the US for example. A US settler 250 years ago could have said the same thing. Though it wasn't in your original question, your post 6 did say this;\n \n \nI am addressing the question of why the great majority of people continue to hold onto religious beliefs in a world full of so much scientific evidence that disproves many (though it is important to note that not all) those beliefs. \n\n \n I don't believe questioning God's motives or fairness is spawned by new science. Ideological scientific paths aren't the cause of those questions, they are the result of those questions. Those questions come from a different realm than science. What's important to many Christians, is to avoid indoctrinating the blank sheets of paper of young school childrens minds with ideological scientific paths before they get the chance to ask questions that come from a different realm than science. A realm that my not be fully developed until they're practically adults. \n \n My Christian religious belief isn't just about satisfying emotional and spiritual needs, I believe it's truth, and it's kind to me personally. I'm not going to second guess God on what's just and what isn't. I'm not trying to appear selfish by using the word \"personally\", I'm trying to make it clear that I can't control other people. If someone else is going to accept the free gift that I have accepted, they are going to have to do it themselves, no one else can do it for them. There's NO person reading this that can't (or couldn't have) easily do (or done) it, and no one that I desire not do it. Not Hitler, not Al-Zarqawi, (sp?) not the worst name calling posters here, NO ONE. \n \n \nTo be honest, even from a young age when I was still part of the Roman Catholic faith, I never did place much credence in the existence of Satan.

Essentially, a belief in Satan has warranted an \"F\" for me in the sense of any such belief being in the least bit emotionally or spiritually satisfying. \n\n \n Greed, lust for power, and shutting off empathy seem to describe Satan pretty well, as the Bible describes him. The answers are in Genesis! Not being a Roman Catholic, I'm not sure how thoroughly the book of Genesis is taught, or how seriously it is taken by them. Without it, Christianity is greatly cheapened. Atheists know it, that's why they attack it more than any other book of the Bible. \n \n \nScience itself does not automatically exclude the supernatural on principle. It simply follows paths spelled out for it by evidence. \n\n \n But science is always performed by humans, and as I said above, I believe very few, if any of them to be completely neutral. With so little neutrality, it's not possible to draw a distinctive line showing where following paths is a search in science, or a search in ideology. I don't think searches for abiogenesis are one bit different than searches in ID. \n \n \nIf a supernatural would show clear and irrefutable evidence of itself, then I am sure that many scientists would excitedly jump aboard and analyze that evidence to death and explore that new exciting proven direction of existence. \n\n \n Some have, (Discovery Institute, Creation Research Institute) but progress is slow without public funding, and the new young minds in public schools that are being blocked from seeing it. The majority of scientists who have not jumped on board haven't avoided it from a neutral position, they've avoided it from a previously commited Darwinist position. Evolution does have many religious characteristics, the main one is that those who are interested in it and study it have a strong faith in it, and a desire that it not be proven wrong, or in some cases even questioned. In many cases, their entire livelihood depends on it. \n \n \n(If you deny this, then you could even try holding a poll in this forum). Unfortunately, any evidence that people do try to present has been poor, judging by the usual standards of scientific evidence. This has happened so often that I would agree that scientists rarely if ever even explore the possibility of a supernatural. It has led to too many dead-ends so the general assumption is that it does not exist. \n\n \n Dead ends aren't automatically determined by neutrality. I've glanced through Stenger's \"How Science shows that God does not exist\", and even my quick glance combined with my limited knowledge of Biblical details shows me (and many with my worldview) that Stenger hit a dead end. He makes no attempt to understand Christianity. Satan doesn't want him to. \n \n \n \nI'm not really following you here. Could you elaborate?\n\n \n Sorry I wasn't clear, I tried to pack too much in two sentences. Most social theories are formed by worldviews - a concept of what human capacities and limitations are. Traditions, economic speculations, morals, and other things, are seen differently by those who believe in eternity, and those who don't. By patterns, I'm referring to the left vs right political patterns in the US. With evolution, it didn't take long to get started - it was started by people from Darwin's generation. Herbert Spencer was one of the first to attempt to draw moral codes / social codes from his beliefs about evolution. Simple to complex, there's very little about Christianity concerning simple to complex. Christianity often sees high ideals and social solutions of self anointed leaders to be futile and counterproductive. How often do you hear the term \"atheist conservatives\" or \"Christian progressives\"? It is no coincidence that most Christians are Republicans, and most atheists are Democrats. There are exceptions to every rule of course - Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson come to mind - Christian liberals. But questions of their honesty also come to mind, IMO further reducing the actual exceptions this rule, the atheist/liberal, Christian/conservative one. As far as plots go, each side accuses the other of things that neither are organized enough to carry out. Some extreme Christians claim that atheism seeks to outlaw religion in the US. Some extreme atheists claim that Christians want to force Christianity on them. Neither are an organized plot, but both sides probably figure that their worst fears could be confirmed given enough time, with enough political steps by the other side. The fairly recent God-like characteristics of the latest ideological science exploration seem to be clashing more and more with traditional Christianity. \n \n As an agnostic, do you have an easy time shrugging this conflict off, concerning voting and political participation? Are you content to remain an agnostic your whole life, or would you like to firmly choose a \"side\"?",

They were based not on Darwinian theory, which Spencer knew little or nothing about at the time, but on much older systems of race and class stratification that taught that people held the position they had in life because of intrinsic and inborn worth and ability. It was a political justification of 19th century capitalism and social structure, not any scientific theory based on solid biology such as Darwin's.\n \n \nSimple to complex, there's very little about Christianity concerning simple to complex. Christianity often sees high ideals and social solutions of self anointed leaders to be futile and counterproductive. How often do you hear the term \"atheist conservatives\" or \"Christian progressives\"? It is no coincidence that most Christians are Republicans, and most atheists are Democrats.\n\n \n Oy! The head aches at this. Only on the most restrictive definition of \"Christian\" as meaning \"right-wing Protestant\" can it be said that most Christians are Republicans. Very many Christians are Democrats and liberals, and many more are political independents. It's true that conservative Christians tend to be Republicans and liberal Christians tend to be Democrats, but this is by no means a sure rule. And yes, Virginia, lots of conservatives have been atheists, such as Ayn Rand, HL Mencken and Barry Goldwater. \n \n \nThere are exceptions to every rule of course - Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson come to mind - Christian liberals. But questions of their honesty also come to mind, IMO further reducing the actual exceptions this rule, the atheist/liberal, Christian/conservative one.\n\n \n The mind boggles. Sharpton and Jackson are liberals, therefore they must be lying about being Christians, because a Christian has been defined as a conservative Republican! The fact is that atheism and Christian belief span the entire political spectrum. If anything, I'd hazard a guess and suggest most atheists are independents rather than registered Democrats. \n \n\n As far as plots go, each side accuses the other of things that neither are organized enough to carry out. Some extreme Christians claim that atheism seeks to outlaw religion in the US. Some extreme atheists claim that Christians want to force Christianity on them.

The fairly recent God-like characteristics of the latest ideological science exploration seem to be clashing more and more with traditional Christianity. \n \n \n What? Which bit of recent science exploration is more god-like than any other? And why is it supposed to be ideological? Science does clash with fundamentalist Christianity -- worse, it disproves it. But fundamentalist Christianity is really only a recent wart on the body religious, starting to gain numbers at the beginning of the 20th century. It is not traditional Christianity at all, though its adherents like to think they are traditional.",

   "...forwarding of Darwin's theory did what you put into words nicely, it attempted to limit \"any apparent role any supernatural might have\", not only in science, but in societal decisions.\n\n You know, we-- or should I say, I tried having this conversation with you earlier.

   "There is so much wrong here, it's hard to know whether to begin, or just treat it as an impossible train wreck...\n \n \n \n The etymology of \"gay\" as meaning same-sex-loving goes back to the 19th century at least, and perhaps longer. Anyhoo, it is still a pleasant word. \n\n \n Sorry, not in the US. Where are you from? Like so many here, your location seems to be a secret. \n \n I NEVER heard the word \"gay\" used to describe homosexuality in the 60's - not in my personal experiences, and not in national communications. A girl in my high school class's first name was \"Gay\". I never heard anyone ever make fun of her, never heard anyone question it or say a thing about it. As I remember her she was an average student, average or slightly above average looks, and had a quiet demeanor. If you think a school child like that today wouldn't have a hard time carrying the first name of \"Gay\" in public schools, I guess that's something we would have to agree to disagree on. \n \n If you think it's a pleasant word today, again, agree to disagree is the only solution. When the term \"gay marriage\" immediately opens bitter political disagreement - when \"gay crusaders\" perform vulgar public protests, I don't see the word as pleasant as I once did. \n \n \nAtheism isn't even a coherent philosophical position. Philosophies might incorporate an atheist perspective, but all atheism means is a lack of belief in god(s). It doesn't denote a positive belief in any particular alternative. Therefore atheism as such could never be a religion, as that would abuse the meaning of both words. \n\n \n There are plenty of variations - atheists, free thinkers, humanists, skeptics, many others. Not all of them forcefully declare that God does not exist. But the only really politically important thing they have in common is that they don't CARE if God exists. They all have the same rejection of God's role in the world, or in the case of US politics, the role of religion in the first 100 years of US existance. \n \n \n \n \nAtheists may seek comfort from any number of humanist or other philosophies, and science is a comfortable fit with atheism, because it necessarily abjures and excludes religious ideas. Science is also the only way we know of to understand the natural world. \n\n \n No, it's the only way atheists know to understand the real world. \n \n \n Religious revelation isn't even a close second. \n\n \n It depends on what it is you're trying to understand. There is a lot more to the natural world than things we can see and touch. \n \n \nThe existence of a supernatural world is a hypothetical speculation that science has not yet been able to address. \n\n \n Science will never be able to address it, under some definitions of science.\n \n \n \n\"Progress\" in ID Creationism is slow because it has no scientific methodology. It's just warmed over Creation Science, which is nothing more than cryptic Christianity. ID Creationism is religion in scientific togs, but you have to do more than wear a lab coat to be a scientist.\n\n \n Progress in the religion of evolution is much faster because it is claimed to have scientific methodology. It's just warmed over atheism. Atheism in scientific togs. Courts and corruption make it possible. \n \n \nEvolution is no more a matter of faith than heliocentricity. It's an observable fact of nature. The only scientific controversy left in evolution is the relative importance of various mechanisms, not its reality. \n\n \n Depends on how it's defined at any given moment. \n \n \nHerbert Spencer published his views on what eventually came to be known as social Darwinism and eugenics years before Darwin published Origin of Species. They were based not on Darwinian theory, which Spencer knew little or nothing about at the time, but on much older systems of race and class stratification that taught that people held the position they had in life because of intrinsic and inborn worth and ability. It was a political justification of 19th century capitalism and social structure, not any scientific theory based on solid biology such as Darwin's. \n\n \n Then why was it called social Darwinism, if it had nothing to do with Darwinism? \n \n \nOy! The head aches at this. Only on the most restrictive definition of \"Christian\" as meaning \"right-wing Protestant\" can it be said that most Christians are Republicans. Very many Christians are Democrats and liberals, and many more are political independents. It's true that conservative Christians tend to be Republicans and liberal Christians tend to be Democrats, but this is by no means a sure rule. And yes, Virginia, lots of conservatives have been atheists, such as Ayn Rand, HL Mencken and Barry Goldwater. \n\n \n I don't consider ~three~ to be \"lots\". Whether it's newspaper editors, talk show hosts, Hollywood elite, or book authors like Ann Coulter / Michael Moore the political differences / religions are always pretty harmonious and predictable. Can you name any current well known atheist conservatives, or Christian liberals that are on the same level as Coulter, Limbaugh, O'Reilly, or Moore, Bill Maher, Randi Rhodes? \n \n There are two fundamentally different principles on how the world works. The crossovers in elections and some policial details are just that, details. If I'm wrong, we would have more than two major political parties. \n \n \nThe mind boggles. Sharpton and Jackson are liberals, therefore they must be lying about being Christians, because a Christian has been defined as a conservative Republican! \n\n \n No, it's suspected that they may be lying about being Christians because they agree with atheists so often concerning social solutions. \n \n \nThe fact is that atheism and Christian belief span the entire political spectrum. If anything, I'd hazard a guess and suggest most atheists are independents rather than registered Democrats. \n\n \n They do in the minor details, but not in the basics. \n \n \n \n \n \nWhat? Which bit of recent science exploration is more god-like than any other? \n\n \n All the bits that proclaim what happened in the ancient past, the ones that have no repeatable, verifiable evidence. \n \n \nAnd why is it supposed to be ideological? Science does clash with fundamentalist Christianity -- worse, it disproves it. But fundamentalist Christianity is really only a recent wart on the body religious, starting to gain numbers at the beginning of the 20th century. It is not traditional Christianity at all, though its adherents like to think they are traditional.\n\n \n Fundamentalist Christianity was the overwhelming majority of the US population when it was founded. What do you think the differences are between fundamentalist Christianity and traditional Christianity? \n \n Science (those who represent it, that is) have been making new atheistic proclamations in recent decades. It seems to me that atheists are trying to play word games - to label Christians who are too blind to see their atheistic science as \"traditional\", while labeling those who are wise to them as \"fundamentalists\".",

Only in your mind. I'm just pointing out that irrespective of your personal ignorance of etymology or language evolution, the history of the word gay in this context is over 100 years old.

There isn't one -- might as well talk about Santa Claus. Religion, on the other hand, has had a big role in human culture, not always to the good. It's partly because of the rejection of these negative, authoritarian aspects of religious belief that the US Constitution took the form it did. The founders were anxious to allow freedom of and from religion, as opposed the theocracies they had escaped from.\n \n \nNo, it's the only way atheists know to understand the real world. \n\n \n Actually, science is the only way religious believers have of knowing the natural world, too. Many just refuse to admit it. Religion and science are not equivalently legitimate ways of knowing, because religion is a creative invention of the human mind with no referents in reality, whereas although science is also a creation of the human mind, it is empirically testable by comparing scientific models to how nature works.\n \n \nIt depends on what it is you're trying to understand.

It's just warmed over atheism. Atheism in scientific togs. Courts and corruption make it possible. \n\n \n There is no \"religion of evolution\". To claim there is is to misunderstand religion, evolution, or probably both.\n \n \nThen why was it called social Darwinism, if it had nothing to do with Darwinism?\n \n \n Beats me. They should have called it Spencerism. As a sociopolitical theory it has nothing whatever to do with biological Darwinian theory. It makes as much sense as Capitalism or Communism, scientifically speaking. They are all social philosophies with no scientific content whatever.\n \n \nI don't consider ~three~ to be \"lots\".

The GOP has become such a den of religious extremists, true conservatives are hanging on for dear life. It's true that atheist conservatives aren't the publicity hounds jerks like Coulter are. But there are plenty out there. You just don't want to see past your religious nose. Try Googling them, and you'll get plenty of links to conservative atheists.\n \n \nThere are two fundamentally different principles on how the world works. The crossovers in elections and some policial details are just that, details. If I'm wrong, we would have more than two major political parties. \n\n \n That must be news to people who don't hold with either one of those principles -- whatever they are! The reason there are only two political parties is strictly due to the voting system -- same as in Britain. Third parties get squeezed out. Look to nations with various kinds of proportional or transferable voting systems, and you'll find that political as well religious views are far more multidimensional than your simple dichotomy allows for.\n \n \nNo, it's suspected that they may be lying about being Christians because they agree with atheists so often concerning social solutions.\n \n \n That is one of the dumbest things I've seen. So atheists and Christians cannot possibly agree on social solutions to social problems? Only if you insist on dragging your superstitions into everything. Actually, atheists and Christians can often agree on practical matters, because they don't involve dragging someone's idea of a deity into them.\n \n \nFundamentalist Christianity was the overwhelming majority of the US population when it was founded. What do you think the differences are between fundamentalist Christianity and traditional Christianity? \n\n \n Sorry, but fundamentalist Christianity as we know it today is a recent, counter-Enlightenment invention. The Enlightenment itself was in large part the product of scholarly, freethinking Christians, who weren't fundamentalists by any stretch of the imagination. The US was founded by a coalition of Christians, deists and Enlightenment freethinkers. Religious fundamentalism is just religious insanity, whether it is Christian or Muslim.\n \n \nScience (those who represent it, that is) have been making new atheistic proclamations in recent decades. It seems to me that atheists are trying to play word games - to label Christians who are too blind to see their atheistic science as \"traditional\", while labeling those who are wise to them as \"fundamentalists\".\n\n \n Individual scientists can make whatever proclamations they want. Science as such is only a tool, not a political lobby, and makes no proclamations as such. Science isn't atheistic, otherwise Christians wouldn't be able to do any. Science, when used properly, works for atheists, Christians, Hindus, Muslims, agnostics, and anyone who who wants to use it correctly. It merely requires that god(s) should not be appealed to as explanations of anything when trying to understand how the natural world works.",

   "Another opinion", 
   "I don't think the book is officially closed on it. When I was growing up in the 60's, the word \"gay\" was a pleasant, uncontroversial word. It wasn't changed to represent homosexuality overnight, but it did happen. My point is, that there may not be a tremendous difference in a factor that religion instills, vs a factor that atheism instills. And that maybe atheism is progressing into something that is more passionately opposing religion, making it more similar to religion. Religion that the US Constitution does not permit to be established. \n\n The one dogmatic aspect of atheism which I would agree exists is their apparent idea that, if something has no evidence, it cannot exist - at least where this applies to any supernatural. As an agnostic, as well as a scientist, I disagree with that dogma. However, I and most agnostics would agree with the atheists on the inverse of that statement - if something shows no evidence of its existence then one cannot make any confident claims of its existence. This logical arguement is the main reason behind the lack of faith of both atheists and agnostics in established religions. Atheists take the full extra step of claiming that there can be no supernatural - presumably on dogmatic principle.\n \nI don't think agnosticism is an absolute 50/50 neutral viewpoint. Wikipedia has a pretty good read on it. This one sentence jumped out at me;\n \"Darwin's bulldog\", Thomas Huxley invented the term. His belief was that the supernatural was unknown and unknowable, but his forwarding of Darwin's theory did what you put into words nicely, it attempted to limit \"any apparent role any supernatural might have\", not only in science, but in societal decisions. That's hardly innocent neutrality. I have noticed at least one, and possibly more posters here at these forums declare themselves agnostics, yet attack religion in a way that doesn't separate themselves from atheists in any noticable way. Proof of the truth of the above Wikipedia statement about variation is made clear when David Horowitz claims to be an agnostic. (You remember him - the ABOR guy) No question that there is very little similarity in his worldview vs the worldview of modern day Thomas Huxleys. Bottom line - the term covers too much variation, and is an indicator that there is very little neutrality between Christianity and atheism, concerning political decisions in the western world. \n\n I would be careful of how one uses the term \"neutral\". Neutral does not mean that one judges all world views as being equally valid. Neutral means that one judges all world views by the same standard - the standard of evidence. I would admit that, even where that sort of neutrality is concerned, the number of dead ends that have been reached by occasional attempts at scientific analysis of evidence presented by religion have led most scientists to automatically assume that any evidence claimed by the religious to be bogus. It is a bit of a \"boy who cried wolf\" effect. After a while, one automatically stops believing the boy - which would be a pity if a real wolf did show up. That is why I urge fellow scientists and others to continue to try to keep an open mind. Keep judging any evidence based on the same rigid standards applied in scientific study, but don't automatically discount evidence because it comes from sources that have mostly been unreliable.\n \nIs that stress factor completely gone in agnosticism? Or is it also there somewhat, maybe even comparable to Christianity? I even suspect there may be traces of it in atheism as well. Atheism seems to seek comfort in science, implying that it's the only source of knowledge. It's not. \n\n Not all atheists or agnostics are people whose previous faith has lapsed - as was my case, coming from a moderate Roman Catholic faith. So, I cannot speak for all agnostics or atheists. Most of the understanding that I do have of the positive and negative appeals of religion come from my own experience and from hearing a multitude of expressed opinions by others. As for the stress factor, I doubt that any of the agnostics or atheists that have no religious background would feel any sense of cosmic judgment. However, all people have some sense of morality and \"fairness\" and some sense of conscience. If they do something they know goes against that inner sense of morality, then they will probably be judging themselves for it. \n \nBasically, yes. (replacing your word \"God\" with the name \"Jesus Christ\".) But any specifics of it are not for humans to know. (Judge not, lest thou be judged - Matthew 7:1) I suppose those who sincerely believe in Christ and make lots of mistakes could be different than one who claims a belief, but isn't sincere. Different belief systems, with absolutely no exposure to Christianity - I don't believe we can know how they will be judged. I do know, (and this may not be a very Christian promoting thing to say) that not a single one of us asked to be born. I don't think God is going to be as hard to get along with concerning judgment as Satan wants us to think. \n\n Your saying that \"specifics of it are not for humans to know\" is something that has always bothered me about religious arguments. So often, there are things that most people would agree would seem very unfair within a religious interpretation - ex. God letting a small child be kidnapped, sexually exploited and killed or, in this case, letting someone who murders and tortures innocent people but who believes in Jesus go to heaven while Ghandi might go to hell. Whenever there are inconsistencies or unfair aspects pointed out, the answer that is so often given (both to outsiders and to insiders) is that one cannot know God's ways. It seems like such a \"cop out\" - as if someone made up an imperfect belief system and, once those inconsistencies and unfair aspects were exposed, used the argument that \"one cannot know God's ways\" to hide all flaws and stop any questions. It seems that your faith is such that you automatically do not question any aspect of the religion you were taught, but from the point of view of someone, such as myself, who tries to look at various religious stories objectively, it just does not make sense if one assumes a benevolent, super-intelligent, omnipotent and omniscient God. \n \nNoted, but remember that has nothing to do with any advancement in scientific or human knowledge since......the founding of the US for example. A US settler 250 years ago could have said the same thing. Though it wasn't in your original question, your post 6 did say this;\n \n I don't believe questioning God's motives or fairness is spawned by new science. Ideological scientific paths aren't the cause of those questions, they are the result of those questions. Those questions come from a different realm than science. What's important to many Christians, is to avoid indoctrinating the blank sheets of paper of young school childrens minds with ideological scientific paths before they get the chance to ask questions that come from a different realm than science. A realm that my not be fully developed until they're practically adults.\n\n I know that people have questioned certain beliefs from time immemorial, so it is not science that has spawned these questions. Indeed, I would agree that it was a combination of the questioning of aspects of religious belief and the re-introduction of classical texts through interaction with the medieval Islam world (that had preserved the ancient Greek and Roman knowledge) that really started the change in thinking. I do think, however, that the advent of science presented a new respected world view that contradicted most religious teachings and the respectability of this new world view allowed many more people to question their faith than otherwise would have - where they might have felt far more alone and intimidated earlier. \n \nMy Christian religious belief isn't just about satisfying emotional and spiritual needs, I believe it's truth, and it's kind to me personally. I'm not going to second guess God on what's just and what isn't. I'm not trying to appear selfish by using the word \"personally\", I'm trying to make it clear that I can't control other people. If someone else is going to accept the free gift that I have accepted, they are going to have to do it themselves, no one else can do it for them. There's NO person reading this that can't (or couldn't have) easily do (or done) it, and no one that I desire not do it. Not Hitler, not Al-Zarqawi, (sp?) not the worst name calling posters here, NO ONE. \n\n It just seems to me to be too easy a path to a hypothetical heaven, and far too unjust for those who happen to be of another world view but who are otherwise virtuous people. I just find too many contradictions with that world view and the idea of an omniscient, benevolent God to be drawn to such a belief. The only draw I can imagine is a sense of comfort one might have that all one needs to do is believe in Jesus in order to go to heaven and that one's actions won't come back to haunt you. \n \nGreed, lust for power, and shutting off empathy seem to describe Satan pretty well, as the Bible describes him. The answers are in Genesis! Not being a Roman Catholic, I'm not sure how thoroughly the book of Genesis is taught, or how seriously it is taken by them. Without it, Christianity is greatly cheapened. Atheists know it, that's why they attack it more than any other book of the Bible. \n\n In the moderate Roman Catholic faith I grew up with, Satan was only mentioned a few times in the 15-20 years or so in which I fairly regularly attended church. It just would not have gone over well since, from the few discussions I had with others, people generally did not really believe in Satan. One does not need a belief in Satan to explain the evil things that man does to man. From your point of view, why is a belief in Satan necessary? What events in human history do you think demonstrate his existence?\n \n As for the book of Genesis, that is the book of the Bible whose story is most addressable by contradictory evidence of science, which is why I am not surprised that it is the one that is the most attacked. \n \nBut science is always performed by humans, and as I said above, I believe very few, if any of them to be completely neutral. With so little neutrality, it's not possible to draw a distinctive line showing where following paths is a search in science, or a search in ideology. I don't think searches for abiogenesis are one bit different than searches in ID.\n\n I am not familiar with all the scientific efforts in exploring abiogenesis, but my guess would be that they constitute the question of how easily many of the biological components could form by normal chemical means given environments similar to primordial earth. If those exploring abiogenesis could replicate the beginnings of life in the lab, then that could show a possible path that abiogenesis could have taken in our beginnings. That does not mean that it was THE path that was taken, but any such explorations could shed light on the natural trends that could lead to the emergence of life that do not assume any force external to natural forces we already are familiar with from scientific evidence. The highlights show the difference between abiogenesis and ID. Abiogenisis, as I understand it, tries to find ways in which life could have started given nature as we understand it from scientific experiments. ID assumes that there exist intelligent forces that drive the beginnings of life - forces which show no direct evidence of themselves. \n \nSome have, (Discovery Institute, Creation Research Institute) but progress is slow without public funding, and the new young minds in public schools that are being blocked from seeing it. The majority of scientists who have not jumped on board haven't avoided it from a neutral position, they've avoided it from a previously commited Darwinist position. Evolution does have many religious characteristics, the main one is that those who are interested in it and study it have a strong faith in it, and a desire that it not be proven wrong, or in some cases even questioned. In many cases, their entire livelihood depends on it. \n\n Unless the results from the Discovery Institute meet the rigorous demands of science, they should not be presented in school as science. Indeed, it is typically only the well supported science that is presented in school curricula. Do you claim that there are some results from the Discovery Institute that meet the rigorous demands of scientific evidence? If so, I would be quite interested in learning about those results. The trouble that usually comes with any evidence presented of the supernatural is that it does not stand the test of debate.\n \nDead ends aren't automatically determined by neutrality. I've glanced through Stenger's \"How Science shows that God does not exist\", and even my quick glance combined with my limited knowledge of Biblical details shows me (and many with my worldview) that Stenger hit a dead end. He makes no attempt to understand Christianity. Satan doesn't want him to. \n\n I don't think anyone can disprove the existence of a supernatural of any sort, but neither can anyone currently prove it. Where Science and religion most contradict each other is in areas where certain religions tell a story, where the evidence that science analyses tells another story (ex. creation vs evolution). So, science can limit certain roles that people claim for a supernatural, but it cannot disprove a supernatural all together. I am not familiar with Stenger's work, but my guess would be that he might be centering his arguments on those aspects of certain religious beliefs which science can disprove. However, I would not be at all surprised if he overstepped the bounds of evidence in trying to disprove all of it. Without reading his book, I cannot really comment either way. \n \nSorry I wasn't clear, I tried to pack too much in two sentences. Most social theories are formed by worldviews - a concept of what human capacities and limitations are. Traditions, economic speculations, morals, and other things, are seen differently by those who believe in eternity, and those who don't. By patterns, I'm referring to the left vs right political patterns in the US. With evolution, it didn't take long to get started - it was started by people from Darwin's generation. Herbert Spencer was one of the first to attempt to draw moral codes / social codes from his beliefs about evolution. Simple to complex, there's very little about Christianity concerning simple to complex. Christianity often sees high ideals and social solutions of self anointed leaders to be futile and counterproductive. How often do you hear the term \"atheist conservatives\" or \"Christian progressives\"? It is no coincidence that most Christians are Republicans, and most atheists are Democrats. There are exceptions to every rule of course - Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson come to mind - Christian liberals. But questions of their honesty also come to mind, IMO further reducing the actual exceptions this rule, the atheist/liberal, Christian/conservative one. As far as plots go, each side accuses the other of things that neither are organized enough to carry out. Some extreme Christians claim that atheism seeks to outlaw religion in the US. Some extreme atheists claim that Christians want to force Christianity on them. Neither are an organized plot, but both sides probably figure that their worst fears could be confirmed given enough time, with enough political steps by the other side. The fairly recent God-like characteristics of the latest ideological science exploration seem to be clashing more and more with traditional Christianity. \n \n As an agnostic, do you have an easy time shrugging this conflict off, concerning voting and political participation? Are you content to remain an agnostic your whole life, or would you like to firmly choose a \"side\"?\n\n I don't really believe in having to stick with one side in a conflict, but to determine my own opinion based on listening to both sides of the argument and doing my own background research. That is part of the reason why I chose the name \"Another Opinion\" in this forum and why I so often find myself making arguments between two sides in a conflict. Even if I don't agree with an opponent, I think it is important to understand all the arguments and not to jump to assumptions. \n \n Where religion is concerned, for nearly twenty years now, I have pretty much settled into an agnostic view. I would like to believe in certain aspects of religion but, until I can see evidence, I can claim no confidence in any such belief and remain intellectually honest. I cannot just take off the \"thinking cap\" of analytical thinking and jump blindly into a confident faith. So, I think that I will remain in this state of limbo of \"not knowing\" because that is all that I logically can do. I do have a personal trust that, if a supernatural does exist and an afterlife does exist, then we will be judged by how we comport ourselves in life - i.e. that there would be some sense of fairness in a hypothetical afterlife. Meanwhile, I accept the strong possibility that there is nothing more beyond this physical life - that we cease to exist once we physically die, that evil acts sometimes never get punished, etc. \n \n As for the conflict between atheism and religion, I think that people should have the right to believe whatever they wish to believe but also do not think that they should have the right to impose their beliefs on others through law. I don't think that the Christian right should be able to impose religious laws in the US in the same way that I would not agree with Islam imposing laws in the US. Similarly, atheists should not have the right to impose laws that disband churches or forbid private religious practice as was done under Communist rule in the USSR. The bottom line is that I do believe in separation of church and state.",

In my view, that is not as directly applicable to the concept of abiogenesis as is the production of simple amino acids from replicated \"primordial soup\". Though I am not very familiar with the novel technologies of DNA synthesis, I would highly doubt that these techniques would have arisen naturally in early earth. The main challenge for abiogenesis, I would think, is in understanding the conditions on this planet early on and how various biochemical processes could have naturally started under those conditions. What were the first most simple cells and metabolisms? Where do you draw the line between a sustained chemical reaction and life? How did the first proto-life forms replicate? All of these are questions which I think abiogenesis tries to explore. Going full circle, perhaps the new technologies of synthetic life forms can help us to understand what aspects of DNA are needed (or whether one even needs DNA) for self replication - and other such questions. Abiogenesis is an interesting field - very indirect (since we don't have any evidence left of such early life) but enlightening.",

   "The one dogmatic aspect of atheism which I would agree exists is their apparent idea that, if something has no evidence, it cannot exist - at least where this applies to any supernatural. As an agnostic, as well as a scientist, I disagree with that dogma. However, I and most agnostics would agree with the atheists on the inverse of that statement - if something shows no evidence of its existence then one cannot make any confident claims of its existence. This logical arguement is the main reason behind the lack of faith of both atheists and agnostics in established religions. Atheists take the full extra step of claiming that there can be no supernatural - presumably on dogmatic principle. \n\n \n I make confident claims of the Christian Deity for two (I believe, logical) reasons.\n \n 1)If it doesn't exist, some alternative to it HAS to exist, to explain origins. I don't see enough evidence for anything else, but I do see some evidence for an alternative, just enough to fulfill what the Bible says about choice. \n \n 2)There is evidence for wisdom in Christianity. The books of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Romans, Corinthians, Galatians, Thessalonians, to name a few. These books have advise on how to live (managing money, relating to others, etc.) that is just as applicable today as it was thousands of years ago. \n \n \nI would be careful of how one uses the term \"neutral\". Neutral does not mean that one judges all world views as being equally valid. Neutral means that one judges all world views by the same standard - the standard of evidence. \n\n \n But one is not being neutral if the only standard he/she is using is scientific evidence. Science cannot cover all political decisions. \n \n \nI would admit that, even where that sort of neutrality is concerned, the number of dead ends that have been reached by occasional attempts at scientific analysis of evidence presented by religion have led most scientists to automatically assume that any evidence claimed by the religious to be bogus. It is a bit of a \"boy who cried wolf\" effect. After a while, one automatically stops believing the boy - which would be a pity if a real wolf did show up. That is why I urge fellow scientists and others to continue to try to keep an open mind. Keep judging any evidence based on the same rigid standards applied in scientific study, but don't automatically discount evidence because it comes from sources that have mostly been unreliable. \n\n \n Admittedly, ID sometimes (but not always) does tend to try to advance itself not by evidence FOR a supernatural, but to try to validate my number 1 logic above; by trying to make an alternative look weaker. Irreducible complexity may be an example - it may try to invalidate evolution more than it tries to validate an intelligent designer. Evolutionists quickly dismiss that as an \"it couldn't have evolved so it must have been designed, fallacy\" yet they do the exact same thing when they try to disprove the book of Genesis. \"Genesis is false, to we must have evolved\". I realize they'll immediately claim that they can prove we evolved, but it's a house without a foundation. They have nothing for origins. \n \n I suspect ID researchers may be a little more careful than in the past about releasing results of their studies bit by bit - they may be waiting for a more complete package. The thinking behind Irreducible complexity seems to have been introduced shortly after it was conceived, and massive, bitter emotional attacks against it by evolutionists may have left IDists a little more wise about just what they're up against. The standards aren't only scientific, there are political ones as well. \n \n \n \nNot all atheists or agnostics are people whose previous faith has lapsed - as was my case, coming from a moderate Roman Catholic faith. So, I cannot speak for all agnostics or atheists. Most of the understanding that I do have of the positive and negative appeals of religion come from my own experience and from hearing a multitude of expressed opinions by others.\n\n \n Some people seem to be turned off by Christianity because of expressed opinions of Christians, and it's understandable, but unfortunate. Christians aren't perfect, and come from many different measures of faith. I believe that's part of God's plan - for Christians to have different personalities, and worship him from different denominations. Christians shouldn't be the source of judgment for Christianity - Christianity itself should be, through the only unchanging authority, the Bible. IMO the most brief, direct outline of Christianity is the book of FIRST JOHN. \n \n \nAs for the stress factor, I doubt that any of the agnostics or atheists that have no religious background would feel any sense of cosmic judgment. However, all people have some sense of morality and \"fairness\" and some sense of conscience. If they do something they know goes against that inner sense of morality, then they will probably be judging themselves for it. \n\n \n I don't know - you may have a higher regard for human nature than I do. :)\n \n \nYour saying that \"specifics of it are not for humans to know\" is something that has always bothered me about religious arguments. So often, there are things that most people would agree would seem very unfair within a religious interpretation - ex. God letting a small child be kidnapped, sexually exploited and killed or, in this case, letting someone who murders and tortures innocent people but who believes in Jesus go to heaven while Ghandi might go to hell. Whenever there are inconsistencies or unfair aspects pointed out, the answer that is so often given (both to outsiders and to insiders) is that one cannot know God's ways. It seems like such a \"cop out\" - as if someone made up an imperfect belief system and, once those inconsistencies and unfair aspects were exposed, used the argument that \"one cannot know God's ways\" to hide all flaws and stop any questions. It seems that your faith is such that you automatically do not question any aspect of the religion you were taught, but from the point of view of someone, such as myself, who tries to look at various religious stories objectively, it just does not make sense if one assumes a benevolent, super-intelligent, omnipotent and omniscient God. \n\n \n My faith is that way because of what the Bible says, in Proverbs 3, 5&6.\n \n \nTrust in the Lord with all thine heart, and lean not unto thine own understanding;\n In all ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. \n\n \n \n \nI know that people have questioned certain beliefs from time immemorial, so it is not science that has spawned these questions. Indeed, I would agree that it was a combination of the questioning of aspects of religious belief and the re-introduction of classical texts through interaction with the medieval Islam world (that had preserved the ancient Greek and Roman knowledge) that really started the change in thinking. I do think, however, that the advent of science presented a new respected world view that contradicted most religious teachings and the respectability of this new world view allowed many more people to question their faith than otherwise would have - where they might have felt far more alone and intimidated earlier. \n\n \n More and more questioning of faith is a main prophesy of the Bible. One of many references;\n \n \n Second Peter, 3; 3 \"...in the last days, scoffers will come...\"\n\n \n \nIt just seems to me to be too easy a path to a hypothetical heaven, and far too unjust for those who happen to be of another world view but who are otherwise virtuous people. I just find too many contradictions with that world view and the idea of an omniscient, benevolent God to be drawn to such a belief. The only draw I can imagine is a sense of comfort one might have that all one needs to do is believe in Jesus in order to go to heaven and that one's actions won't come back to haunt you. \n\n \n You're not asking me to preach to you, so I won't. \n \n \nIn the moderate Roman Catholic faith I grew up with, Satan was only mentioned a few times in the 15-20 years or so in which I fairly regularly attended church. It just would not have gone over well since, from the few discussions I had with others, people generally did not really believe in Satan. One does not need a belief in Satan to explain the evil things that man does to man. From your point of view, why is a belief in Satan necessary? What events in human history do you think demonstrate his existence? \n\n \n It's basic in the Protestant Christian faith. The Bible is loaded with references to him. I don't think there's enough bandwidth here for me to list all events in human history that point to his existence. \n \n \nAs for the book of Genesis, that is the book of the Bible whose story is most addressable by contradictory evidence of science, which is why I am not surprised that it is the one that is the most attacked. \n\n \n I've seen atheist bloggers go into Exodus, (parting of the Red Sea) and miracles performed by Christ, etc. but not often at all. I think science, with a naturalistic basis, can be used against all of the Bible equally, if so desired. That it (for now) seems to focus only on Genesis doesn't seem completely honest to me. \n \n \nI am not familiar with all the scientific efforts in exploring abiogenesis, but my guess would be that they constitute the question of how easily many of the biological components could form by normal chemical means given environments similar to primordial earth. If those exploring abiogenesis could replicate the beginnings of life in the lab, then that could show a possible path that abiogenesis could have taken in our beginnings. That does not mean that it was THE path that was taken, but any such explorations could shed light on the natural trends that could lead to the emergence of life that do not assume any force external to natural forces we already are familiar with from scientific evidence. The highlights show the difference between abiogenesis and ID. Abiogenisis, as I understand it, tries to find ways in which life could have started given nature as we understand it from scientific experiments. ID assumes that there exist intelligent forces that drive the beginnings of life - forces which show no direct evidence of themselves. \n\n \n I'm sure not going to attempt to put forward anything for ID at this time - it's been done several times here, including one formal debate, and it's quite clear that godless evolutionists outnumber creationists by about....... 30 to 1 on these forums. It's much closer to 1 to 1 among US citizens, and I can't understand how half the citizenry can stand by silently while public money is used to finance exploration in atheism, as abiogenesis clearly is. I realize that several atheists will now check in, call me five names, and then inform me that ideological searches in abiogenesis help us understand gravity, harness electricity, and do plumbing. If it's done privately, it's no more objectionable than private studies of ID. But when it's done in public education in a multi-trillion dollar government, if flirts with unconstitutionality. Can you name one practical application of something like abiogenesis in modern society that ID exploration is proven to not be able to do? In other words, why are searches for atheism considered practical, while searches for design not considered practical? \n \n \nUnless the results from the Discovery Institute meet the rigorous demands of science, they should not be presented in school as science. Indeed, it is typically only the well supported science that is presented in school curricula. \n\n \n That would be more believable if US students excelled at science compared to the rest of the world. Surveys show that they don't. Many high school students don't know Einstein's famous quotation. They don't know about photosynthesis or Boyles law. But I'll bet they know that there was no worldwide flood! Or that the earth is billions of years old!\n \n \n Do you claim that there are some results from the Discovery Institute that meet the rigorous demands of scientific evidence? If so, I would be quite interested in learning about those results. The trouble that usually comes with any evidence presented of the supernatural is that it does not stand the test of debate. \n\n \n It should be fair for someone without a presupposition of godlessness to ask for more, legitimate rigorous demands for evolution. Both sides do it, and it should be applied equally. Evolution makes rigorous demands of ID, but won't allow ID to make rigorous demands of evolution. \n \n \nI don't think anyone can disprove the existence of a supernatural of any sort, but neither can anyone currently prove it. Where Science and religion most contradict each other is in areas where certain religions tell a story, where the evidence that science analyses tells another story (ex. creation vs evolution). So, science can limit certain roles that people claim for a supernatural, but it cannot disprove a supernatural all together. I am not familiar with Stenger's work, but my guess would be that he might be centering his arguments on those aspects of certain religious beliefs which science can disprove. However, I would not be at all surprised if he overstepped the bounds of evidence in trying to disprove all of it. Without reading his book, I cannot really comment either way. \n\n \n The main thing he did was overstep the bounds of how science is defined. (by a small handful of wordsmiths, that is) But that understandably didn't cause a publisher to reject his book, or prevent copies of it from flying off the shelves in bookstores. The reason is that words aren't defined by wordsmiths, they're defined, often quite loosely, by a society at large. \n \n \n \n \nI don't really believe in having to stick with one side in a conflict, but to determine my own opinion based on listening to both sides of the argument and doing my own background research. That is part of the reason why I chose the name \"Another Opinion\" in this forum and why I so often find myself making arguments between two sides in a conflict. Even if I don't agree with an opponent, I think it is important to understand all the arguments and not to jump to assumptions. \n \n Where religion is concerned, for nearly twenty years now, I have pretty much settled into an agnostic view. I would like to believe in certain aspects of religion but, until I can see evidence, I can claim no confidence in any such belief and remain intellectually honest. I cannot just take off the \"thinking cap\" of analytical thinking and jump blindly into a confident faith. So, I think that I will remain in this state of limbo of \"not knowing\" because that is all that I logically can do. I do have a personal trust that, if a supernatural does exist and an afterlife does exist, then we will be judged by how we comport ourselves in life - i.e. that there would be some sense of fairness in a hypothetical afterlife. Meanwhile, I accept the strong possibility that there is nothing more beyond this physical life - that we cease to exist once we physically die, that evil acts sometimes never get punished, etc. \n\n \n \n I understand, and I hope I've answered a few of your questions about why Christians continue to hold their belief. I know that Christianity doesn't have foolproof evidence, but I don't see foolproof evidence anywhere else. When I see atheists jumping to conclusions about why I ask about someones location as in the posts above, or when I see atheists deny that there is a two way cultural conflict going on in the US, I simply don't trust them to tell me that the earth is billions of years old. \n \n \n \nAs for the conflict between atheism and religion, I think that people should have the right to believe whatever they wish to believe but also do not think that they should have the right to impose their beliefs on others through law. I don't think that the Christian right should be able to impose religious laws in the US in the same way that I would not agree with Islam imposing laws in the US. Similarly, atheists should not have the right to impose laws that disband churches or forbid private religious practice as was done under Communist rule in the USSR. The bottom line is that I do believe in separation of church and state.\n\n \n This largely concerns the \"two way cultural conflict\" that I referenced above. Your's seems like a neutral position, but I think it favors the atheist one. My previous paragraph to lesz sums that up I think;\n \n \nThere are plenty of variations - atheists, free thinkers, humanists, skeptics, many others. Not all of them forcefully declare that God does not exist. But the only really politically important thing they have in common is that they don't CARE if God exists. They all have the same rejection of God's role in the world, or in the case of US politics, the role of religion in the first 100 years of US existance. \n\n \n Most atheists don't seek to disband churches or forbid private religious practice. Keeping it around in a small way even strengthens their position. You see atheist posters here claiming to not mind religion being taught at all, as long as it's nowhere near science classes. Daniel Dennett, one of many of todays atheist authors, urges that schools teach religion as a purely natural phenomenon, that is, as if it is not true. The strategy is not to argue with religious views or prove them wrong, but to reduce it to non reality, so it's not taken seriously in the public arena. \n \n The religious right doesn't attempt to impose religious laws near as much as it attempts to maintain religious tradition. One of the main issues in the two way cultural conflict is agreement on how much the US foundations are Christian, or secular. Actual history shows that it's a blend of both - not completely Christian, but not completely secular. What Christianity is there, is sought to be maintained by one side in the cultural conflict, and sought to be cheapened by the other side. Christian art, architecture, literature, music, and morals largely define how our society is organized and how we live. It's been \"evolving\" some since the 1800's, but why should Christian tradition be outlawed? You mention separation of church and state, that term is as vague and broad as the term \"evolution\". Matthew 22; 21 says \"Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's, and to God that which is God's.\" This tells me that separation of religion and government isn't necessarily a secular idea, as far as the non-establishment clause of the first amendment takes it. If it's taken further, to claim that religion has no place in the public arena - that morality derived from religion should not be permitted to shape our laws as it has been in the past, then it's a close to previous USSR communist prohibitions as it can get.",

   "\" ... Gay. -Usage note In addition to its original and continuing senses of \"merry, lively\" and \"bright or showy,\" gay has had various senses dealing with sexual conduct since the 17th century. A gay woman was a prostitute, a gay man a womanizer, a gay house a brothel. This sexual world included homosexuals too, and gay as an adjective meaning \"homosexual\" goes back at least to the early 1900s. After World War II, as social attitudes toward sexuality began to change, gay was applied openly by homosexuals to themselves, first as an adjective and later as a noun. Today, the noun often designates only a male homosexual: gays and lesbians. The word has ceased to be slang and is not used disparagingly.

   "Meanings of words can evolve, and I've never seen one evolve as fast as the word \"gay\" has. I suspect a minority, special interest group combined with the US liberal media, can make one evolve in only a few decades, if they put enough effort into it. Will atheism put that much effort into the word \"bright\"? Too early to tell. \n \n The word gay in the homosexual context is not 100 years old in the US, it's that simple. There was a 1948 movie in the US called \"The Gay Ranchero\". Check out these reviews, and find me ONE HINT of homosexuality there. \n \n http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040385/usercomments\n \n And you're going to tell me that if a 2008 movie called \"The Gay Ranchero\" was made about a singing cowboy, that no one would suspect a content of homosexuality?\n\n \n If you think \"special interest groups\" can conspire to force the evolution of language usage, all I can say is that language evolves from the bottom up; it is rarely if ever constructed top down in the way that devious Englishman George Orwell imagined it could be. No edict from Gay Central or other den of foreign conspirators or product advertisers can force people to use language in ways they do not consent to. When meanings change, or new words come into the language, they do it organically, not by design. People accept or reject them, and words live and die by that free choice.\n \n The point about the etymology of the word \"gay\" is not that its usage increased since the 1950s as more and more people became openly gay, but that it had long roots, and wasn't appropriated haphazardly or with any intent to dragoon a \"happy\" word to describe filthy, disgusting sodomites, as you seem to think. It grew naturally. Gay people liked it because all the alternatives of the day were either pejorative, coined by filthy, disgusting homohaters who condemned the alleged immorality of same-sex love, or clinical, based on the equally mistaken perception of homosexuality as a dysfunction. It took time to become popularly accepted, but that shift merely reflects the growing acceptance of gay people in the larger heterosexual community.\n \n As for your initial thesis that all good Christians are conservative right-wingers, and all liberals are liars who can't possibly be Christians, it's still bogus and refuted by experience. I can't believe any thinking person would be so simplistic. Christianity exists across the political spectrum; as does atheism; and there are lots of policies atheists and Christians can agree on as practical considerations. One doesn't have to believe in any religion to decide where to build a road or peg an interest rate, for example.",

   "Another opinion", 
   "I make confident claims of the Christian Deity for two (I believe, logical) reasons.\n \n 1)If it doesn't exist, some alternative to it HAS to exist, to explain origins. I don't see enough evidence for anything else, but I do see some evidence for an alternative, just enough to fulfill what the Bible says about choice. \n\n Though I would say that Evolution has a large amount of evidence to support it, I agree that the evidence supporting the very beginnings of life (abiogenesis), though it is continuing to make strides, seems to be far more limited. Part of it is that direct evidence of the first life forms has long since disappeared and evidence showing the state of early earth is quite limited. That still leaves some room for other interpretations - including potentially spiritual ones. However, those interpretations (such as ID) need to pass the same stringent tests of evidence and logic as do any theories suggested by abiogenesis. The bottom line is that we really don't know at this point how exactly life began. Nevertheless, though we don't know the very beginnings, there is no evidence that it happened as was outlined in the Bible and much evidence against it - since the Bible proclaims that complex animals (mammals, etc.) appeared out of nothing, which Evolution disproves. So, I personally would allow for the possibility of supernatural involvement - but not in the traditional sense of creation.\n \n2)There is evidence for wisdom in Christianity. The books of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Romans, Corinthians, Galatians, Thessalonians, to name a few. These books have advise on how to live (managing money, relating to others, etc.) that is just as applicable today as it was thousands of years ago. \n\n I agree that there is a lot of wisdom passed on in Christian texts (as well as texts of other religions, for that matter) and that this is a point that is insufficiently acknowledged by those who are not religious. I suspect that those teachings that seem unjust and illogical (such as the proclamations against Gays) make many jump to the assumptions that all religious teaching is mired in intolerance and hatred but that is just not so. Christianity teaches one to love thy neighbor (which some people enjoy misinterpreting...), to give to charities, to control ones lower impulses, etc. There are many good teachings that probably have, one average, left the world a less hostile place. There are many people who, without the control of religion, would allow themselves far more selfish and cruel behavior. I do not think that one needs to accept the theological story behind the Bible to be able to find wisdom in it.\n \nBut one is not being neutral if the only standard he/she is using is scientific evidence. Science cannot cover all political decisions.\n\n I agree that Scientific evidence is not the only evidence out there. Nevertheless, any evidence (scientific, anecdotal or otherwise) needs to be analyzed and explored before it can be trusted. A topic which I don't think has been sufficiently discussed is the question of how one would go about finding evidence for the supernatural. The key question would be how to differentiate people's spiritual experiences from imagination - where I think that full analysis would allow one to explore that. Unfortunately, it is a touchy subject to explore. I tried to start a thread here once to hear out people's spiritual experiences with rules that the thread was just to be to hear them out, not to discuss them. Unfortunately, though some people were open-minded enough to listen, flaming started almost immediately. So, I can understand why people are reluctant to present their experiences. Ideally, I would love to hear and discuss and analyze such experiences in a calm and respectful and open-minded setting, but this seems impossible in most forums.\n \nAdmittedly, ID sometimes (but not always) does tend to try to advance itself not by evidence FOR a supernatural, but to try to validate my number 1 logic above; by trying to make an alternative look weaker. Irreducible complexity may be an example - it may try to invalidate evolution more than it tries to validate an intelligent designer. Evolutionists quickly dismiss that as an \"it couldn't have evolved so it must have been designed, fallacy\" yet they do the exact same thing when they try to disprove the book of Genesis. \"Genesis is false, to we must have evolved\". I realize they'll immediately claim that they can prove we evolved, but it's a house without a foundation. They have nothing for origins.\n\n I would split Evolution away from Abiogenesis (though sometimes people do combine them). Evolution seems to take off from the first evidence of life - single celled organisms that have shown some fossil evidence of themselves over 2 billion years ago. What happened before that is mainly conjecture and simulated environments. If Genesis were worded far more vaguely (ex. stating that God created the first life of even the simplest form), then Atheists and Agnostics would have a harder time attacking it. Unfortunately for traditional Christian faith, Genesis adds a lot of details about the creation process (such as complex animals being created out of nothing) that leaves it far more open to attack, based on the evidence of evolution. \n \nI suspect ID researchers may be a little more careful than in the past about releasing results of their studies bit by bit - they may be waiting for a more complete package. The thinking behind Irreducible complexity seems to have been introduced shortly after it was conceived, and massive, bitter emotional attacks against it by evolutionists may have left IDists a little more wise about just what they're up against. The standards aren't only scientific, there are political ones as well. \n\n The huge obstacle that ID faces is mainly that, in order to prove itself, it is not sufficient to poke holes in the competing theory (Evolution) but to give some evidence of a creator/designer. Until it does so, it will not stand up to the standards of science. This is true for any scientific theory. It needs to present evidence of itself, not just refute other theories, in order to be taken seriously. I think that the main political contraversy with ID is that it portrays itself as science, not as religion. If it stayed within the confines of religion and religion classes in schools, then there would be far less controversy. \n \nSome people seem to be turned off by Christianity because of expressed opinions of Christians, and it's understandable, but unfortunate. Christians aren't perfect, and come from many different measures of faith. I believe that's part of God's plan - for Christians to have different personalities, and worship him from different denominations. Christians shouldn't be the source of judgment for Christianity - Christianity itself should be, through the only unchanging authority, the Bible. IMO the most brief, direct outline of Christianity is the book of FIRST JOHN. \n\n Unfortunately, the most contraversial, vocal and publisized statements by the religious right have been statements of those views that cause contraversy - such as proclamations against Gays, sex before marriage, etc. - where many of these views are expressed with anger and accusations. This gives many people the impression of the religious right as being purely about intolerance and hatred, which it is not. I have heard that there are some new trends coming from the younger generation which are inspired by religion to try to solve some of the worlds problems of hunger, etc. If the religious right could show this more positive side of its beliefs to the world, then perceptions of it might change and I hope that some better communication might start between the two sides ... one can always hope.\n \nI've seen atheist bloggers go into Exodus, (parting of the Red Sea) and miracles performed by Christ, etc. but not often at all. I think science, with a naturalistic basis, can be used against all of the Bible equally, if so desired. That it (for now) seems to focus only on Genesis doesn't seem completely honest to me. \n\n Most events of the bible are about local events that, if they happened, would mainly leave no evidence of themselves - such as the teachings or miracles of Jesus. So, it is hard to attack them without denying a supernatural all together. Genesis does talk about global events of which science does have a lot of evidence that refutes its story. In general, the areas of religious belief that get most attacked are the ones that have some overlap with scientific knowledge. \n \nI'm sure not going to attempt to put forward anything for ID at this time - it's been done several times here, including one formal debate, and it's quite clear that godless evolutionists outnumber creationists by about....... 30 to 1 on these forums. It's much closer to 1 to 1 among US citizens, and I can't understand how half the citizenry can stand by silently while public money is used to finance exploration in atheism, as abiogenesis clearly is. I realize that several atheists will now check in, call me five names, and then inform me that ideological searches in abiogenesis help us understand gravity, harness electricity, and do plumbing. If it's done privately, it's no more objectionable than private studies of ID. But when it's done in public education in a multi-trillion dollar government, if flirts with unconstitutionality. Can you name one practical application of something like abiogenesis in modern society that ID exploration is proven to not be able to do? In other words, why are searches for atheism considered practical, while searches for design not considered practical? \n\n Abiogenesis falls under the general category of Science. There is funding mostly for practical aspects of Science but some funding for scientific knowledge just for the sake of the knowledge. Abiogenesis does have some overlap with the attempts at making synthetic life (a potentially practical application), so perhaps some of its funding is interdisciplinary. In general, religious studies (which most would view ID falling under) do not get government funding but expect to get funding from the religions themselves. I would expect that is why ID gets so much less funding than does abiogenesis. If it wants to benefit financially from falling under the category of science, it needs to meet scientific standards of evidence - which it continues to fail to do.\n \nIt should be fair for someone without a presupposition of godlessness to ask for more, legitimate rigorous demands for evolution. Both sides do it, and it should be applied equally. Evolution makes rigorous demands of ID, but won't allow ID to make rigorous demands of evolution. \n\n I think that ID has every right to try to poke holes at the evidence of Evolution but those supporting Evolution have every right to defend themselves against the accusations. I think that is one positive aspect of ID - it tries to search out the problems within the theory of Evolution. If those espousing a theory become too complacent, they might miss problems with the theory. Those who point out problems with the theory might eventually point out something that does need to be addressed.\n \nThe main thing he did was overstep the bounds of how science is defined. (by a small handful of wordsmiths, that is) But that understandably didn't cause a publisher to reject his book, or prevent copies of it from flying off the shelves in bookstores. The reason is that words aren't defined by wordsmiths, they're defined, often quite loosely, by a society at large. \n\n Publishing to the lay public does not undergo the tests of peer review that scientific publications go through. So, scientists can often publish rubish out in the non-scientific world and get away with it. I suspect that Stenger included a combination of real science and such quasi-science mixed with simple opinion. Either way, I am not at all suprised that it was published and was popular - contraversy and extreme opinions sell.\n \nI understand, and I hope I've answered a few of your questions about why Christians continue to hold their belief. I know that Christianity doesn't have foolproof evidence, but I don't see foolproof evidence anywhere else. When I see atheists jumping to conclusions about why I ask about someones location as in the posts above, or when I see atheists deny that there is a two way cultural conflict going on in the US, I simply don't trust them to tell me that the earth is billions of years old. \n\n Though I often find it hard to understand why more religious people don't question their beliefs (which may or may not result in changes to those beliefs), I do understand many of the draws to religion and many of the positive aspects associated with religious belief. I would love to get more of a chance to analyze the experiences which people have had which make them feel that they have evidence supporting their beliefs - not just a blind leap of faith - but understand that it is hard to find a forum for such discussions.\n \nMost atheists don't seek to disband churches or forbid private religious practice. Keeping it around in a small way even strengthens their position. You see atheist posters here claiming to not mind religion being taught at all, as long as it's nowhere near science classes. Daniel Dennett, one of many of todays atheist authors, urges that schools teach religion as a purely natural phenomenon, that is, as if it is not true. The strategy is not to argue with religious views or prove them wrong, but to reduce it to non reality, so it's not taken seriously in the public arena.\n\n I would be fine with students being taught religion in elective religion class (and at home) and a minimum of required science being taught in science class - and let the kids decide based on both sets of arguements. I don't think there is any call for teachers in religion class to make a claim that it is false - just present the religion (or religions) beliefs as best they can. \n \nThe religious right doesn't attempt to impose religious laws near as much as it attempts to maintain religious tradition. One of the main issues in the two way cultural conflict is agreement on how much the US foundations are Christian, or secular. Actual history shows that it's a blend of both - not completely Christian, but not completely secular. What Christianity is there, is sought to be maintained by one side in the cultural conflict, and sought to be cheapened by the other side.

If it's taken further, to claim that religion has no place in the public arena - that morality derived from religion should not be permitted to shape our laws as it has been in the past, then it's a close to previous USSR communist prohibitions as it can get.\n\n I would differentiate between Christian art, Christian philosophy and Christian culture from art, philosophy and culture developed by Christians. Christians are not only inspired by religion but by secular aspects as well. I don't really see any aspects of the founding that can purely be ascribed to religious views. However, this would probably be too long a topic to go into...",

   "Though I would say that Evolution has a large amount of evidence to support it, I agree that the evidence supporting the very beginnings of life (abiogenesis), though it is continuing to make strides, seems to be far more limited. Part of it is that direct evidence of the first life forms has long since disappeared and evidence showing the state of early earth is quite limited. That still leaves some room for other interpretations - including potentially spiritual ones. However, those interpretations (such as ID) need to pass the same stringent tests of evidence and logic as do any theories suggested by abiogenesis. The bottom line is that we really don't know at this point how exactly life began. Nevertheless, though we don't know the very beginnings, there is no evidence that it happened as was outlined in the Bible and much evidence against it - since the Bible proclaims that complex animals (mammals, etc.) appeared out of nothing, which Evolution disproves. So, I personally would allow for the possibility of supernatural involvement - but not in the traditional sense of creation. \n\n \n Agree to disagree :) I think it's controversial just exactly what evolution disproves. Humans have been surprised before, by new findings, and I think it could happen again. \n \n \nI agree that there is a lot of wisdom passed on in Christian texts (as well as texts of other religions, for that matter) and that this is a point that is insufficiently acknowledged by those who are not religious. I suspect that those teachings that seem unjust and illogical (such as the proclamations against Gays) make many jump to the assumptions that all religious teaching is mired in intolerance and hatred but that is just not so. Christianity teaches one to love thy neighbor (which some people enjoy misinterpreting...), to give to charities, to control ones lower impulses, etc. There are many good teachings that probably have, one average, left the world a less hostile place. There are many people who, without the control of religion, would allow themselves far more selfish and cruel behavior. I do not think that one needs to accept the theological story behind the Bible to be able to find wisdom in it. \n\n \n What many non-religious people in the US are doing today is acknowledging some aspects of common sense in the Bible, yet saying it's obvious in a secular way, or comes from another source. In a few cases they may have a point, but in many cases they don't - I think they try too hard to downplay the wisdom of the Bible. \n \n \nI agree that Scientific evidence is not the only evidence out there. Nevertheless, any evidence (scientific, anecdotal or otherwise) needs to be analyzed and explored before it can be trusted. A topic which I don't think has been sufficiently discussed is the question of how one would go about finding evidence for the supernatural. The key question would be how to differentiate people's spiritual experiences from imagination - where I think that full analysis would allow one to explore that. Unfortunately, it is a touchy subject to explore. I tried to start a thread here once to hear out people's spiritual experiences with rules that the thread was just to be to hear them out, not to discuss them. Unfortunately, though some people were open-minded enough to listen, flaming started almost immediately. So, I can understand why people are reluctant to present their experiences. Ideally, I would love to hear and discuss and analyze such experiences in a calm and respectful and open-minded setting, but this seems impossible in most forums.\n\n \n Michael Ruse, an evolutionist/philosopher, said this;\n \n \nI am sure that my Quaker background prepared me for philosophy and its cleansing actions, for from a tender age I had been used to argument rather than faith. No doubt this unique version of Christianity which has no creed or ritual or any of the other paraphernalia associated with most religions made the slide to skepticism and atheism fairly easy. Although, unlike many of my friends, neither then nor now did/do I develop a passionate hatred of Christianity. \n\n \n I think you're a lot like that too, and I appreciate it. Among people who are opinionated about it, most non believers in the US do seem to be like Ruse's \"friends\". Other posters in this thread, as examples? I just find myself wondering if this forums evolutionists anger represents the majority of evolutionists pretty well, or if the more non opinionated ones (the ones who wouldn't post on forums like this) would be more easy going like you and Ruse. \n \n \nI would split Evolution away from Abiogenesis (though sometimes people do combine them). Evolution seems to take off from the first evidence of life - single celled organisms that have shown some fossil evidence of themselves over 2 billion years ago. What happened before that is mainly conjecture and simulated environments. If Genesis were worded far more vaguely (ex. stating that God created the first life of even the simplest form), then Atheists and Agnostics would have a harder time attacking it. Unfortunately for traditional Christian faith, Genesis adds a lot of details about the creation process (such as complex animals being created out of nothing) that leaves it far more open to attack, based on the evidence of evolution. \n\n \n \n \n \nThe huge obstacle that ID faces is mainly that, in order to prove itself, it is not sufficient to poke holes in the competing theory (Evolution) but to give some evidence of a creator/designer. \n\n \n The idea of it is not to address a creator designer, it's to address the work of the creator. Not the designer, just evidence of design. The idea is to not address who the designer is, just like evolution supposedly doesn't directly say there is no God. \n \n \nUntil it does so, it will not stand up to the standards of science. This is true for any scientific theory. It needs to present evidence of itself, not just refute other theories, in order to be taken seriously. I think that the main political contraversy with ID is that it portrays itself as science, not as religion. If it stayed within the confines of religion and religion classes in schools, then there would be far less controversy. \n\n \n Now that the courts have spoken, there really shouldn't be any controversy. As it's being done privately, it should be able to define itself any way it wishes. \n \n \nUnfortunately, the most contraversial, vocal and publisized statements by the religious right have been statements of those views that cause contraversy - such as proclamations against Gays, sex before marriage, etc. - where many of these views are expressed with anger and accusations. This gives many people the impression of the religious right as being purely about intolerance and hatred, which it is not. I have heard that there are some new trends coming from the younger generation which are inspired by religion to try to solve some of the worlds problems of hunger, etc. If the religious right could show this more positive side of its beliefs to the world, then perceptions of it might change and I hope that some better communication might start between the two sides ... one can always hope.\n\n \n I agree, but I think those that get the impression of intolerance and hatred from the religious right refuse to acknowedge that it may be nothing more than the religious rights attempt to maintain tradition. History is a good indicator of human behavior. \n \n \nMost events of the bible are about local events that, if they happened, would mainly leave no evidence of themselves - such as the teachings or miracles of Jesus. So, it is hard to attack them without denying a supernatural all together. Genesis does talk about global events of which science does have a lot of evidence that refutes its story. In general, the areas of religious belief that get most attacked are the ones that have some overlap with scientific knowledge. \n \n Abiogenesis falls under the general category of Science. There is funding mostly for practical aspects of Science but some funding for scientific knowledge just for the sake of the knowledge. Abiogenesis does have some overlap with the attempts at making synthetic life (a potentially practical application), so perhaps some of its funding is interdisciplinary. \n\n \n Synthetic life - that's probably like many other controversial political things today. Abortion, embryonic stem cell research etc. Favoring it or opposing it would probably divided according to religion, or lack of it. \n \n \n \n \nIn general, religious studies (which most would view ID falling under) do not get government funding but expect to get funding from the religions themselves. I would expect that is why ID gets so much less funding than does abiogenesis. If it wants to benefit financially from falling under the category of science, it needs to meet scientific standards of evidence - which it continues to fail to do.\n \n I think that ID has every right to try to poke holes at the evidence of Evolution but those supporting Evolution have every right to defend themselves against the accusations. I think that is one positive aspect of ID - it tries to search out the problems within the theory of Evolution. If those espousing a theory become too complacent, they might miss problems with the theory. Those who point out problems with the theory might eventually point out something that does need to be addressed. \n\n \n I agree with that, but the emotion that erupts when evolution is questioned by ID is too intense to convince me that evolution is more than just methodological science. \n \n \nPublishing to the lay public does not undergo the tests of peer review that scientific publications go through. So, scientists can often publish rubish out in the non-scientific world and get away with it. I suspect that Stenger included a combination of real science and such quasi-science mixed with simple opinion. Either way, I am not at all suprised that it was published and was popular - contraversy and extreme opinions sell. \n\n \n So peer reviewers, and others in the scientific community should condemn it! Not in a way to block it from being published, but in a way to make it clear to the general public that it does not have the scientific communitys' endorsment. It doesn't seem to happen, there's a lot of winking and nodding going on. \n \n \nThough I often find it hard to understand why more religious people don't question their beliefs (which may or may not result in changes to those beliefs), I do understand many of the draws to religion and many of the positive aspects associated with religious belief. I would love to get more of a chance to analyze the experiences which people have had which make them feel that they have evidence supporting their beliefs - not just a blind leap of faith - but understand that it is hard to find a forum for such discussions.\n \n I would be fine with students being taught religion in elective religion class (and at home) and a minimum of required science being taught in science class - and let the kids decide based on both sets of arguements. I don't think there is any call for teachers in religion class to make a claim that it is false - just present the religion (or religions) beliefs as best they can. \n \n I would differentiate between Christian art, Christian philosophy and Christian culture from art, philosophy and culture developed by Christians. Christians are not only inspired by religion but by secular aspects as well. I don't really see any aspects of the founding that can purely be ascribed to religious views. However, this would probably be too long a topic to go into...\n\n \n It would be a long one. My last formal debate (THE ONE THAT I LOST - EVERYBODY HEAR THAT, THE ONE THAT I LOST) did touch on it - did you read it? The problem with formal debates is that they often don't get into too much depth. Any effort to take them further after they are over can be a touchy subject. (rubbing it in by the winner - refusal to acknowledge the loss by the loser) but the founders thinking did somewhat go along with the imperfect nature of humans, as taught by Christ. In Federalist #10, Madison didn't have good things to say about human nature, and neither does Christianity. And then there's all the Christian culture/art that was brought to this country by the settlers. Dante, Milton, Shakespeare, Handel, Mozart, Bach - all Christians.",

   "Agree to disagree :) I think it's controversial just exactly what evolution disproves. Humans have been surprised before, by new findings, and I think it could happen again.\n\n It's possible, but there is such a mountain of evidence supporting Evolution now that any change would most likely come in the mechanisms that drive Evolution much more so than in the concept of Evolution (in animals evolving from lower life forms) itself. From what I understand, relatively recent research has shown that genetic interactions, for example, are more complex than originally thought.\n \nWhat many non-religious people in the US are doing today is acknowledging some aspects of common sense in the Bible, yet saying it's obvious in a secular way, or comes from another source. In a few cases they may have a point, but in many cases they don't - I think they try too hard to downplay the wisdom of the Bible. \n\n I would say that there is a lot of overlap between religious and secular morality but the differences are also interesting to note. Not all people have an inner self-consistent and logical sense of morality. I think that, for many people, there needs to be a sense of cosmic/religious judgment watching over their actions for them to feel some constraint on their actions. For others, a belief in a fixed absolute morality gives a sense of finality that keeps them from straying to cruel and/or selfish directions. In this way and others, there are some aspects of religious teachings that just don't have the same effect in secular teachings. Nonetheless, there are also many aspects that do have overlap with secular judgment. \n \nMichael Ruse, an evolutionist/philosopher, said this; ...\n I think you're a lot like that too, and I appreciate it. Among people who are opinionated about it, most non believers in the US do seem to be like Ruse's \"friends\". Other posters in this thread, as examples? I just find myself wondering if this forums evolutionists anger represents the majority of evolutionists pretty well, or if the more non opinionated ones (the ones who wouldn't post on forums like this) would be more easy going like you and Ruse. \n\n From polls that I have seen, it seems that most people in the US try to find some balance between a belief in God and an acceptance of the teachings of Evolution. This means that they usually end up compromising on both sides. It also means that their arguments are not on the extremes. \n \n As for non-believers, as with all people, the way they approach a discussion depends on both the topic and the opponent. With the advent of political power of the religious right, the stakes have been much higher for those who are not strongly religious so the disagreement between the two sides has been much stronger and harsher. This makes discussions on religion vs science and how it relates to morality and law a more delicate subject that both sides have to be careful of handling gently if they want to have a reasonable discussion. I think there isn't enough effort on either side to have a real discussion - accusations and harsh rhethoric is much more satisfying to most. So, though there are some on the non-believer side who make strong efforts at having a calm, respectful discussion (just as there are some on the religious right side who make such efforts), I think most people on both sides succumb to the temptation of having angry heated arguments instead of calm discussions.\n \nThe idea of it is not to address a creator designer, it's to address the work of the creator. Not the designer, just evidence of design. The idea is to not address who the designer is, just like evolution supposedly doesn't directly say there is no God. \n\n That leaves ID with a nearly impossible task since, to prove that something biological needs a designer to exist without showing any evidence of the designer themselves, one would have to prove that there is NO other way in which the thing could have come into being - no natural way. As with those claiming that God does not exist, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to prove that type of negative argument.\n \nI agree, but I think those that get the impression of intolerance and hatred from the religious right refuse to acknowedge that it may be nothing more than the religious rights attempt to maintain tradition. History is a good indicator of human behavior. \n\n There are good traditions and bad traditions. Democracy did not come into full existence until recent human history - should divine right of kings have been upheld as a tradition? For centuries, people believed that the earth was flat - should people have continued to believe that despite evidence for the sake of tradition? There was a tradition in Europe of anti-Semitism that grew to the point that, in Germany, the Nazi movement tried to exterminate all Jews. Some traditions SHOULD be fought. I certainly do not think that ALL traditions are bad. There are many traditions that are well worth keeping and I bemoan the fact that some people would try to \"throw the baby out with the bathwater\" in rejecting all traditional thought. However, it is important to analyze ones traditions to find out what is the \"bathwater\" and what is the \"baby\". Rejecting certain traditions also does not automatically mean that you insult your ancestors. After all, if all our ancestors had not rejected some of their earlier traditions, then human culture would never have progressed. \nSynthetic life - that's probably like many other controversial political things today. Abortion, embryonic stem cell research etc. Favoring it or opposing it would probably divided according to religion, or lack of it. \n\n Synthetic life is just starting to come into play but I can well imagine that it will be a new controversial subject between the two sides. Initially (which could mean the next decades or longer), synthetic life would limit itself to very simple single-celled life forms - so issues of rights would not come into play. My main concern would be safety - the question of whether we would know what we were doing well enough not to cause great harm (either to our immune systems with a dangerous new virus or bacteria, or to greatly change the environment, etc.). As long as safety concerns would be sufficiently addressed, I wouldn't have much objection.\n \nSo peer reviewers, and others in the scientific community should condemn it! Not in a way to block it from being published, but in a way to make it clear to the general public that it does not have the scientific communitys' endorsment. It doesn't seem to happen, there's a lot of winking and nodding going on. \n\n There really isn't a formal structure in place for that to happen. The only way for the word to get out is for scientists to be quoted by those reviewing the book - which occasionally does happen. \n \nIt would be a long one. My last formal debate (THE ONE THAT I LOST - EVERYBODY HEAR THAT, THE ONE THAT I LOST) did touch on it - did you read it? The problem with formal debates is that they often don't get into too much depth. Any effort to take them further after they are over can be a touchy subject.

In general, it seems to come down to the difference between Christian culture and culture set up by Christians. Either way, the founders were largely of English origin and were opposed to the forced impositions of the Church of England in that country - which is one reason why they didn't want to have religious rules imposed in this country. Anyway, I would prefer not to get into a long discussion on this subject.",
