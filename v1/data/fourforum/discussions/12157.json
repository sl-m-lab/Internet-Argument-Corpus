He said at least one of the people he supervised had been involved in execution preparations at Walla Walla State Penitentiary.\n \n He told his superiors that he objected to his division's involvement, but no solution was found, he said.\n \n Scott Blonien, assistant secretary of the department, characterized Stern's objections as more individual than professional.\n \n \"It's clear to us that Marc had a personal, ethical conflict, and we respect that.

But it's probably one of the only factors that separates our advanced industrialized nation -- as the only one still having the death penalty -- from savage places like Afghanistan, etc.\n \n Having a doctor allows the self-deceptive veneer that a most uncivilized, inhumane act, about to take place, is somehow civilized or humane.

With this, yet one more indication that the death penalty system in our country is unsustainable.

He had to have known that this was part of his duties as the laws currently stand. \n\n \n I think that's a good question. I also wonder how long the medical establishment has had this rule? Since there must be some long-standing procedures in executions in the United States that require, by law, a doctor's supervision. \n \n \nAs far as the death penalty being a deterrent, how exactly can you quantitatively measure such a thing? \n\n \n I read about it some time back, so I stand to be corrected, but I think that was essentially the point. You can't prove it, but you can falsify it from any number of perspectives. For example, there are societies that don't have death penalties and have much lower violent crime rates. (Of course, you could say that the lower crime rate is due to other factors. But you still haven't established a deterrent effect.) Or, the psychological make-up of, say, your average ax murderer emoticon_rolleyes isn't that of someone who's going to care about whether or not they're executed. \n \n \n I believe that there are crimes worthy of death, and that's enough for me.\n\n \n I agree that may be the case (i.e. crimes worthy of death). I think there's a legitimate moral \"question\" however for a legal system. And that the system is so messed up, the moral objective isn't really met, for the most part. And that more harm than good is often done. Overall, I'd say, we'd spare ourselves a lot if we just went with locking some people up and throwing away the key.",

As you've probably read here, I have similar sentiments about the character of some crimes, but don't support it, for the reasons I discussed with snakespit. I think the U.S. may eventually have to throw it out, though, because we need the medical establishment's involvement in executions in our society, for constitutional reasons. And short of someone posting more information about how the execution system works in the U.S., the medical establishment - like the A.M.A., for example - is clearly falling down on the side that says, \"opposed\". And telling doctors that they cannot participate in any way whatsoever.\n \n Btw, I didn't have any background on this particular case before posting this article. Here, though, is another one describing a bit about the crime and case background,\n \n Local News | Judges delay execution of man convicted of two slayings in Clallam County | Seattle Times Newspaper\n \n and here is a photo of the defendant,\n \n Crime Scene KC\n \n My interest in posting the article are the implications with American law and the medical establishment, more than death penalty debate per se. But I have to go right now because of the holidays. So have (safe emoticon_rolleyes) fun as they say, and happy New Year.",
