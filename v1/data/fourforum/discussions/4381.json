There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together 34 and saying, \"It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.\" 35 Then the two told what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread. \n \n Luke 24:36 - While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, \"Peace be with you.\" 37 They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost. 38 He said to them, \"Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds? 39 Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.\" \n \n John 20:16 - Jesus said to her, \"Mary.\" She turned toward him and cried out in Aramaic, \"Rabboni!\" (which means Teacher). 17 Jesus said, \"Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet returned to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, 'I am returning to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.' \" 18 Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news: \"I have seen the Lord!\" And she told them that he had said these things to her. \n \n John 20:19 - On the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples were together, with the doors locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, \"Peace be with you!\" 20 After he said this, he showed them his hands and side. The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord. \n \n John 20:26 - A week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, \"Peace be with you!\" 27 Then he said to Thomas, \"Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.\" 28 Thomas said to him, \"My Lord and my God!\" \n \n 1 Corinthians 15:3 - For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, 5and that he appeared to Peter, and then to the Twelve. 6 After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. 7 Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, 8 and last of all he appeared to me also... \n \n Acts 1:1 - In my former book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach 2 until the day he was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen. 3 After his suffering, he showed himself to these men and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive. He appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God. 4 On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this command: \"Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about. \n \n 1 John 4:14 - And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. \n \n 2 Peter 1:16 - We did not follow cleverly invented stories when we told you about the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.\n \n Luke 1:1 - Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us, 2 just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. 3 Therefore, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, 4 so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught. \n \n Matthew 28:5 - The angel said to the women, \"Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. 6 He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay. 7 Then go quickly and tell his disciples: 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you.\" 8 So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples. 9 Suddenly Jesus met them. \"Greetings,\" he said.

   "The question about what happens to you when you die is founded on the supposition human beings have a soul that is both immaterial and immortal.\n \n If the soul exists and is immortal, then it existed before our birth - for what is incorruptible must also be ungenerated. Now the state of our former existence before birth in no way troubles or concerns us, so neither will the succeeding state after death be of any consequence.\n \n In my view, it's the human horror of total annihilation that gives credibility to the idea of an immortal soul.\n\n \n \n Interesting and valid viewpoint Alan. Lets look at it though a different window. I would like nothing more than for the end of my life to be the END, nothingness, forever.

What if the new ether world where all of the spirits/souls that never die live, is not what it is taught to be ?

Yes, a lot of questions that only the thesist's have answers for, answers drawn from their own knowledge aqcuired by reading the bible of their choice. ...\n \n Now another window. Let's go back in time , a time in our country when life was rough, living day to day had its tribulations. A time of when a failing crop meant starvation for a whole family, a disease like typhoid would fill a grave yard. A time when venturing out in to the unknown west, could mean any of the listed, along with being captured , tortured and killed by native man. Lets think about what kept those starving, bone tired men and women from laying down in the snow beside the covered wagons and just giving up. What was it , in people in those days that give them that little bit of hope , that kept them wanting to keep on and on, in a hopeless situation ? \n \n \n Was it the fear of dying and never living again , the reason they pressed on, or was it the prayer in them speaking to their God and asking for strength ? After all, if one follows the Bible to the word, dying would have been a just way to go back in those days, its promise of the afterlife was sure better than living the tribulations they were living in . ...\n \n \n One more scenario that I think plays in the belief of not, of a afterlife. Lets say a despondent person has given up on life. He went to all the self help programs , took the mind altering drugs, took the counseling. Still suicidal, he is spoken to by some local church's patron, and that person gets him reading the bible. Now, he has already severed all ties with friends and family , gave away or sold all the treasured things in his life and has made plans to terminate his own life. But ,after reading the bible , he sees that ending his life, may not be the END afterall. Therein lies the kicker. Now he has a reason NOT to end his own life, why ? Because he now sees it may not be the end after all, and there may be a worse life in the afterlife waiting for him...\n \n I feel different about the dying and being dead forever bit. My being dead forever is not NEARLY as frightening to me as the thought of living on and on forever in a world of the unknown. At at that , if I did get to live on and on , with my luck, I would would end up being with entities that I didnt want to be around with here on earth . :) all jmo",

What if the raised souls have to live in a world with those that , they were divorced from, hated by, or abused or killed by , and those souls are in their face daily ? ...\n\n I think that in our present states we see all sorts of pain, suffering, neglect, and hate, despondence, indifference, rejection, and negativity whereas we assume that these things must exist in order for that beckoning of a better to exist. That's not necessarily true. Whether there is a god or God or some other entity out there to save us, the human element is dependent on feelings. How we treat those feelings depends on our attitude. To some the feelings of despair would be treated as a challenge and so on.\n Without challenges, however, without problems to initiate them, it is likely that we would still be stuck in the some era where ignorance is bliss. But, humans can't stand for that sort of thing - it's not in our character or spirit (depending on one's belief system).\n For me things on earth are a reflection of things in Heaven. Since I know this (because my \"knower knows\") I realize that all that is good in this life is just a microgram of what it will be in Heaven. Nothing bad or evil will exist in Heaven; there will be no problems, no troubles, no pain, or suffering. Because of Satan this earth-age is filled with it. \n In conclusion, all the bad things one has done in this life is not and will not be reflective in Heaven for any reason, no matter what that sin or situation may have been. All those that have been mistreated by you and all those that have mistreated you will be transformed just as you and I will be - the old passes away and the new is entirely new.\n \nAh yes, my understanding is those that live on in the heavenly existence are supposed to be recyled and recleaned entities , free of the baggage they accumalated on earth, and not recognizable to others. If that it so, then why would one want to live forever in a place they would not recognize their loved ones reborn ? Yes, a lot of questions that only the thesist's have answers for, answers drawn from their own knowledge aqcuired by reading the bible of their choice.\n\n Or just following scripture precept upon precept, line upon line - here a little, there a little. Once the scriptures begin to come together the mysteries are solved. Yes, this work is done solely by the Holy Spirit who is your guide, but He gives it freely to you upon your request. It is not that you will be different than Greg, it just that the real Greg will be different than you. \n \n Clear as mud? :)\n \nNow another window. Let's go back in time , a time in our country when life was rough, living day to day had its tribulations. A time of when a failing crop meant starvation for a whole family, a disease like typhoid would fill a grave yard. A time when venturing out in to the unknown west, could mean any of the listed, along with being captured , tortured and killed by native man.

After all, if one follows the Bible to the word, dying would have been a just way to go back in those days, its promise of the afterlife was sure better than living the tribulations they were living in . \n\n Both, IMO. The driving force in mankind (I use mankind so often because I was chastised for using man in the male/female sense plus it caused so much confusion for some reason) is to live - whatever it takes. The spirit of man is hard to kill. The Nazi's realized it during their reign of terror, certain low-life slave-owners did too, but most of all caring doctors and nurses see it each day. The will to live is one of mankind's strongest attributes.\n Then there were those that lived by and due to prayer and supplication. \n \nOne more scenario that I think plays in the belief of not, of a afterlife. Lets say a despondent person has given up on life. He went to all the self help programs , took the mind altering drugs, took the counseling. Still suicidal, he is spoken to by some local church's patron, and that person gets him reading the bible.

Because he now sees it may not be the end after all, and there may be a worse life in the afterlife waiting for him...\n\n Obtaining the truth about oneself and about God is not a total catastrophe. Maybe going through hell-on-earth is what it takes for some folks to come to their senses...and to the realization that there is something more.\n Hardheaded people, such as myself, have had to butt their heads many times against the truth until we realized that is was immovable. IMHO, being flung to the ground at the foot of the cross was the best thing that ever happened to me.\n \n I feel different about the dying and being dead forever bit. My being dead forever is not NEARLY as frightening to me as the thought of living on and on forever in a world of the unknown. At at that , if I did get to live on and on , with my luck, I would would end up being with entities that I didnt want to be around with here on earth . :) all jmo\n\n All I can say to that, Greg, is that, to me, being absent from the presence of God would be the most tormenting, bone-chilling, horrible thing I can imagine. Just being \"no more\" is a terrible thing even to imagine for that matter.",

Therefore, he was not from Jerusalum.\n\n \n Tsk, tsk.... Grasping at straws there, Trebor. First let's cite Mark 11:1 - \"As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives.\"\n \n First, Mark nowhere says that Christ and his followers went to Bethpage (first) AND THEN to Bethany. Simply because the cities are listed a certain way does not mean that Mark (or Luke) is saying that this is the order that they are approached; no more so does approaching Minneapolis-St. Paul from the St. Paul side, or Dallas-Ft. Worth from the Ft. Worth side, mean we have to reverse the order of the cities to make it clear what direction we are coming from. As long as Mark does not say, \"we went from Jericho to Bethphage, and then to Bethany\" he is not in error (unless the disciples were taking an unusual route for a purpose). Finally, it is far more likely that Mark is listing the approach to Jerusalem in reverse order, in order to stress the importance of their Jerusalem destination. The order of Bethphage and Bethany is simply being determined by their relationship to Jerusalem. \n http://www.answering-islam.org/Responses/Menj/geo-errors1.htm\n \n \nI know you reject it.

The journey to Sidon is NOT a case of \"what they went through to get there,\" but, \"where they went also.\" Douglas Edwards, who, in his essay, \"The Socio-Economic and Cultural Ethos in the First Century,\" has noted: \n \n Indeed, even the Jesus movement's travel from Tyre to Sidon to the Decapolis depicted in Mark, which has struck some New Testament interpreters as evidence for an ignorance of Galilean geography, is, in fact, quite plausible. Josephus notes that during the reign of Antipas, while Herod Agrippa I was in Syria, a dispute regarding boundaries arose between Sidon and Damascus, a city of the Decapolis. It is therefore conceivable that the movement headed east toward Damascus and then south through the region of the Decapolis, following major roads linking Damascus with either Caesarea Philippi or Hippos.

   "Either nothing or... from my Christian research according to the Bible -\n \n According to the Bible a human is composed of a 'body' and a 'spirit' and when those two components unite the whole is known as a 'soul' - man does not HAVE a soul, man IS a soul. The soul is capable of consciousness while the parts (spirit, body) are not. So when I die according to the Bible upon my body's demise my spirit will return to God in heaven but it will not be conscious until it is given a new body.\n \n Upon the ressurection according to the Bible we all get given new mortal bodies while the saints get given 'spiritual bodies' much like the bodies of Angels - immortal bodies of 'spiritual nature'. Then I get judged. If I'm found unworthy I am excecuted and my physical body is thrown in a 'pit' which is located south of Jerusalem in the Valley of Hinnom ('Gehenna' which is translated as 'Hell' in English) where it is burned. My spirit returns to God and remains with him for 1000 years. This death is the age-lasting punishment of 'Hell' talked about in the Bible which is often wrongly translated as 'ever lasting' bringing about the false concept of humans having their conscious spirits thrown into a pit of liquid fire for eternity.\n \n If I'm deemed worthy however I'm rewarded with living in the 'Messianic age' - Jesus's 1000 years, of rule on Earth. During this millenia where \"nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore\" I will live as a mortal human being taught 'the way' by the saints who've been ressurected as immortal spirit beings. This teaching is done so I might become 'pure' enough to be granted the final boon of overcoming death etc and being given a spiritual body like the saints' own forms. The saints get to 'inherit the kingdom of God' and get positioned in all the important jobs while us less saintly individuals simply 'inhabit the kingdom of God'. This life is the age-lasting \"eternal life\" talked about in the Bible (not some life spent in 'the clouds' up in heaven).\n \n After the 1000 years of Jesus's rule God Himself will come down from Heaven and live with Humanity on Earth. The Earth, the current version and the new Earth that will come after the Millennium, will always be the home of mankind.\n \n Presumbly at this time the humans who were executed and had their physical bodies burned will be ressurected but they will still be physically human and mortal. The immortal spiritual bodies are only granted to those who have become 'pure' so there will be still, even in this final age where God dwells on the Earth, physically mortal humans 'in the process of refinement'.",

Brown, Doubleday Pub. \n \n His [Mark's] confusion about Palestinian geography (the Greek of 7:31 shows the author assumes Sidon is south of Tyre, and that the Sea of Galilee is in the midst of the Decapolis, inaccurately in both cases) and his fluency in Greek make it likely that he grew up in an area outside Palestine. - Anchor Bible Dictionary\n \n Mk. 7:31 - Then he returned from the region of Tyre, and went by way of Sidon towards the Sea of Galilee, in the region of the Decapolis. The route is bizarre: the city of Sidon was twenty miles north of Tyre, and the region of the Decapolis was east and southeast of the Sea of Galilee. - NRSV Study Bible, Harper Collins Pub.\n\n \n Orion: It seems that you get these sources from an Islamic website :\"bismikaallahuma.org\".

You represent these ideas as those of him but it looks like that they are out of context quotes on a questionable website who's sole purpose is to discredit chritianity.\n \n I cannot answer in full as it would likely do injustice as the full answer is very lengthy and I don't have time to type that much and do not have an online source.\n \n Please provide sources in context.\n \n It is the same problem that people have when they quote the bible out of context and say \"even the bible says there is no god.\" Put it in context and you realize that the bible actually says \"a fool in his heart says there is no god.\"\n \n Rev.
