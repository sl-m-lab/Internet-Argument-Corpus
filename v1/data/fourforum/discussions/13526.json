   "Single payer amendments threatened in the House. Citizens are called to action: \n \n \nBy Donna Smith -\n When House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announces the healthcare bill she plans to bring to the floor Thursday, will it still have the amendment that allows individual states the option of bypassing legal barriers to pass state single payer bills?\n \n Apparently not, in the latest concession to the insurance industry, Blue Dog Democrats and other conservative interests who seem to have long held the whip hand on healthcare reform.\n \n In July, the House Labor and Education Committee approved an amendment introduced by Rep. Dennis Kucinich that would exempt states that enact Medicare for all/single payer bills from the onerous limitations contained in the federal ERISA law governing employer sponsored health plans.\n \n Since then a rogues gallery of Fortune 500 corporate interests and insurance lobbyists have put a lot of pressure on the House leadership to strip the Kucinich amendment from final bill going to the House floor.\n \n Obviously these interests, especially the healthcare industry which has topped all others in federal lobbying the past decade, have a lot of sway on Capitol Hill (see the Senator from Aetna, Joe Lieberman).\n \n Your voices are needed now to call the House leaders, Speaker Pelosi, and Reps. George Miller and Henry Waxman, floor managers for health care reform in the House. The message is simple: Keep the Kucinich Amendment!\n \n Here&#8217;s where to call:\n Speaker Nancy Pelosi: DC (202) 225.4965 &#8211; SF (415) 556.4862\n Representative George Miller: DC (202) 225.2095 &#8211; Concord (925) 602.1880\n Representative Henry Waxman: DC (202) 225.3976 &#8211; LA (323) 651.1040\n \n Why does this amendment matter?\n \n 1- Even many progressive proponents of the majority bills coming out of the House and Senate will readily concede that those bills are flawed, at best, and fall short of reigning in the main source of our national healthcare crisis.\n \n Here&#8217;s California Nurses Association/National Nurses Organizing Committee Executive Director Rose Ann DeMoro on Countdown with Keith Olbermann Tuesday night discussing the genesis of waste and fraud in our healthcare system &#8211; the system that profits from patient pain and suffering.\n \n 2- Protecting the ability of states which have vibrant single payer movements, including California, Colorado, Illinois, Maine, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania, and others to enact single payer bills has been the strongest incentive for many of the thousands of grassroots single payer activists across the nation to continue to support bills that have been steadily watered down to please the healthcare industry and conservatives.\n \n 3- Passing the main bill with the Kucinich amendment, especially coupled with a big vote for the amendment by Rep. Anthony Weiner to replace the main bill with a Medicare for all bill, would be the single strongest message the House could send to the insurance industry &#8212; as well as to the White House and Senate in advance of negotiations on the conference committee version of a merged Senate and House bill.\n \n 4- How can anyone tout bills to protect the rights of states to opt out or even opt-in on a public option while denying the right or ability of states to opt for more comprehensive reform? Or are the compromises and concessions are only allowed to go in one direction.\n \n Ultimately, a lot of people who have worked for many years for genuine healthcare reform will have to admit that the bills in their present form are not it.\n \n Yes, they do provide subsidies or tax credits for a number of the presently uninsured to buy private health insurance, and put some long overdue restraints on the ability of big insurers to refuse to sell policies to people with pre-existing conditions and rescind coverage for people after they become sick.\n \n But in exchange, the insurers benefit from a massive public bailout in both the subsidies and a new law forcing everyone to buy private insurance, coupled with only limited provisions to contain costs, especially with the many compromises made with the insurance and drug cartels. And no genuinely effective means to stop the disgraceful practice of insurers refusing to authorize needed medical treatment or denying payment for claims for tens of millions of their members.\n \n The result will be fewer uninsured. But insurance premiums, deductibles, co-pays, co-insurance and other fees will continue to skyrocket threatening more people with medical bill-induced bankruptcies and encouraging more people to skip needed medical care because of the cost. And people who are forced to buy insurance will continue to see their urgent appeals for help stamped &#8220;denied&#8221; when they most need it.\n \n That&#8217;s the importance of the Kucinich amendment. It provides a vehicle for nurses, doctors, and other grassroots healthcare activists to carry the fight for the reform almost everyone knows is the best option to state capitols, and establish an alternative model that can be copied by other states, and ultimately Washington.\n \n That is, of course, exactly how a national, single payer system was enacted in Canada. First in one province, and when others saw what they could have, the nation.\n \n The Canadian system is under continual attack by the right, and does have problems, especially in adequate funding. But no one is denied care based on ability to pay. In almost all essential patient outcomes Canada surpasses the U.S. Administrative waste and cost is only a fraction of ours. And the founder of Canadian Medicare, Tommy Douglas, was voted the greatest Canadian in their history.\n \n That&#8217;s why the majority of the nation&#8217;s hands-on front line nurses and doctors have long supported single payer, and expanded and updated Medicare for all. Tell our representatives not to close that door now.\n Donna Smith is a community organizer for the California Nurses Association and National Co-Chair for the Progressive Democrats of America - posted @ healthcare-now.org\n\n \n If you cannot reach the representatives by telephone, they can also be emailed, though Rep Waxman, in spite of his national role and impact, does not appear to be accepting emails from outside his district.

   "12 more single payer advocates were arrested, in Nancy Pelosi's office, calling for inclusion of the Kucinich Amendment and a vote on the Weiner Amendment.\n \n Citizens are called to action:\n \n \nAction Alert: Make Pelosi Keep Her Promise on Single-Payer\n November 3, 2009 by Healthcare-NOW! X &#8232;Filed under Action Alerts, Healthcare-NOW! Updates \n \n Today, 12 brave activists were arrested because they entered Nancy Pelosi&#8217;s office in California to get some answers.\n They wanted to know why she broke her promise to hold votes on two single-payer amendments this fall.\n They weren&#8217;t leaving until the single-payer amendments were put back on the table.\n Pelosi refused to speak to them. They were arrested for disrupting business as usual.\n CALL PELOSI NOW! (415) 556-4862 and (202) 225-0100. Ask her to keep her promise on single-payer.\n Demand that she keep her promises and put Kucinich Amendment in the bill and allow a Floor vote on the Weiner Amendment! @healthcarenow.org\n\n \n A personal account of the demonstration and arrests:\n \n \nNovember 4th, 2009 12:33 PM\n Pelosi Arrested Us for Asking for Healthcare\n By Dan Hodges / After Downing Street\n \n Around 3PM this afternoon I was one of 12 single payer activists who were escorted from the reception area of Nancy Pelosi's office in the San Francisco Federal Building and arrested by members of the Federal Protection Service of U.S. Homeland Security.\n \n Just before noon we went to Pelosi's office to ask Dan Bernal, the district director, make a phone call either to Pelosi herself or Terri McCullough, Pelosi's chief of staff in Washington. We wanted to directly communicate two demands: that the Kucinich amendment be included in the health care bill that will soon be brought to a vote in the House and that the Weiner amendment be voted on by the House, as previously promised by Pelosi.\n For two hours Bernal refused to meet with any of us. Then he called in the police and had them arrange for a meeting with himself and three of us in the reception area. The doors between the reception area and the hallway were closed. Two policemen stayed in the room. The other activists and other police stood outside the closed doors in the hallway. Instead of working out how a call could be made so that we could discuss our demands, Bernal promptly and brusquely said he'd just listen to what we wanted and then all of us had to leave the building. As soon as we said that wasn't why we had agreed to the police's conditions to meet with him, Bernal broke off the meeting, left the reception area and went back inside the locked doors to his office.\n \n Then the police took us from Pelosi's office on the second floor to the basement, where they processed our arrests. Because Bernal was too cowardly to file an official complaint, an elaborate charade was worked out by Bernal, building management and the Federal Protection Service. The misdemeanor charged against all of us was based on a technicality: our singing and chanting for single payer was not in accord with the rules and regulations of the federal building. This technicality was then extended to mean that we had \"disobeyed\" the police officers. We were issued citations and told that we would be summoned to court later. Then we were dismissed from the building.\n \n From noon until we emerged from the basement with our citations in hand, there was a spirited rally for single payer taking place across the street. The demonstrators included a large contingent of members of the California School Employees Association, some of whom had come from Sacramento and Stockton. The rally also included members of California Nurses Association and Single Payer Now.\n \n The \"Pelosi Twelve\" are members of organizations such as ActforSinglePayer, AFSCME District Council 57, California Alliance of Retired Americans, California School Employees Association, Gray Panthers, and Health Care for All-California.\n \n All of us today, those who were arrested and those who rallied in support of us, will keep fighting to get the Kucinich amendment in the House health care bill. And we'll keep fighting to win single payer in California and the nation. Republicans, Blue Dog Democrats or sell-out Democrats, like Nancy Pelosi, will not prevent us from succeeding.\n \n Although the Kucinich amendment was not included in the Manager&#8217;s amendment, the Weiner amendment probably will be offered for a House vote, according to Ellen Shaffer.\n \n The exclusion of the Kucinich amendment is not fatal to our efforts for single payer in California. After all, we worked hard and placed Sen. Sheila Kuehl&#8217;s SB 840 on the governor&#8217;s desk twice without a state waiver in effect. We&#8217;ll move Sen. Mark Leno&#8217;s SB 810 to this governor&#8217;s desk and to that of the next governor without the Kucinich amendment in whatever bill Obama signs. ERISA or no, we&#8217;re going to get single payer achieved in California and the nation.\n \n While it would be easy to focus our contempt on Pelosi, the word is that only Lynn Woolsey in the Progressive Caucus supported Kucinich&#8217;s amendment to the end. In any event, as we all know, our capacity to succeed is fundamentally based on our grassroots power.\n \n Now it&#8217;s up to us to redouble our efforts to build a bigger, stronger and more diverse single payer movement.\n \n And we will win.\n \n Dan Hodges is Chair of Health Care for All-California\n\n \n \n Health care is a human right.
