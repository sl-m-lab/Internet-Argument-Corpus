   "Who will speak out against war crimes committed by US Troops this time?\n \n This morning Wolf Blitzer was interviewing a man who said what John O'Neill said 35 years ago, \"It's not commonplace.\"\n \n But, if a handful of crimes are caught on video, how many are going uncaught?\n \n Here are a few on video:\n \n The most recent case in Fallujah:\n http://www.thenausea.com/elements/usa/iraq%202004/11/crime1.wmv\n War crime: A marine murders a wounded prisioner inside a mosque in Fallujah. One of the soldiers is called \"Arroyo\".\n http://www.thenausea.com/elements/usa/iraq%202004/11/crime2.wmv\n What it is not said is that 24 hours earlier these 5 prisioners were already interrogated and nobody gave them medical care, letting some of them bleed to death. In a previous recording (24 h before), enclosed in a white circle you can see, still alive, the old man that afterwars is shown dead.\n \n Another one in Fallujah.\n http://207.44.245.159/video1/r35297_87992.rm\n A marine says, \"I've just injured one, he's between the two buildings\". At that moment another marine walks over to the gap between the two houses, he then climbs on a forty four gallon drum aims his gun at the injured Iraqi and fires one shot. The marine then climbs back down saying, \"He's done\".\n \n An older video:\n http://www.thenausea.com/elements/usa/iraq%202003/2004%20january/iraq%20murder.wmv\n A wounded iraqi soldier is killed while being on the ground. The Marines cheer his senseless death. The author (of the murder) explains how good he feels.\n \n Now, say what you will, but these are definitely war crimes.\n \n Does someone need to protest? Or is this just part of war?\n \n edit: forgot a couple\n http://www.thenausea.com/elements/usa/iraq%202003/2004%20january/2004%2001%20iraq%20killing.wmv\n 3 iraqi soldiers are killed from an Apache helicopter (Infrared sight). The third one is murdered after being wounded (event that goes against every international convention). \n \n http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/05/01/1051382023070.html?oneclick=true",

The deafening roar of hundreds of people in a confined area yelling, \"Allahu Akbar\" (God is Greatest) reverberate behind his panicked voice. \n \n \"I am being held at gunpoint by American soldiers inside Abu Hanifa mosque Dahr,\" he yells, \"Everyone is praying to God because the Americans are raiding our mosque during Friday prayer!\" \n \n \"I am in a very sad position. I do not see any freedom or any democracy. If this could lead into a freedom, it is a freedom with blood. It is a freedom of emotions of sadness. It is a freedom of killing. You cannot gain democracy through blood or killing. You do not find the freedom that way. People are going to pray to God and they were killed and wounded. There were 1,500 people praying to God and they went on a holiday were people go every Friday for prayers. And they were shot and killed. There were so many women and kids lying on the ground. This is not democracy, neither freedom.\" \n\n \n http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article7330.htm\n \nEyewitness Report: 4 Killed As U.S. Forces Raid Mosque\n \n Dahr Jamail\n \n BAGHDAD, Nov 19 (IPS) - An eyewitness commentary to IPS through a U.S. raid on a Baghdad mosque Friday gives a vivid picture of what a 'successful raid' can be like.\n \n U.S. soldiers raided the Abu Hanifa mosque in Baghdad during Friday prayers, killing at least four and wounding up to 20 worshippers.\n \n \"Everyone was there for Friday prayers, when five Humvees and several trucks carrying INGs entered,\" Abu Talat told IPS on phone from within the mosque while the raid was in progress. \"Everyone starting yelling 'Allahu Akbar' (God is the greatest) because they were frightened. Then the soldiers started shooting the people praying!\"\n \n Talat said he was among a crowd of worshippers being held back at gunpoint by U.S. soldiers. Loud chanting of 'Allahu Akbar' could be heard in the background during his call. Women and children were sobbing, he said.\n \n \"They have just shot and killed at least four of the people praying,\" he said in a panicked voice. \"At least 10 other people are wounded now. We are on our bellies and in a very bad situation.\"\n \n Talat gave his account over short phone calls. He said he was witnessing a horrific scene.\n \n \"We were here praying and now there are 50 here with their guns on us,\" he said. \"They are holding our heads to the ground, and everyone is in chaos. This is the worst situation possible. They cannot see me talking to you. They are roughing up a blind man now.\" He evidently could talk no further then.\n \n \"One Iraqi National Guardsmen held his gun on people and yelled, 'I will kill you if you don't shut up',\" said Rana Aziz, a mother who had been trapped in the mosque.. \"So they made everyone lie down, then people got quiet, and they took the women and children out.\"\n \n She said someone asked the soldiers if they would be made hostages. A soldier used foul language and asked everyone to shut up, she said. Suddenly, she laughed amid her tears. \"The Americans have learnt how to say shut up in Arabic, 'Inchev'.\"\n\n \n http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article7328.htm\n \nUK complained to US about alleged Iraq abuse\n \n 11/19/04 \"AFP\" -- \n \n Britain has frequently expressed concern to Washington at the highest level about US troops allegedly mistreating victims in Iraq, most recently in October, a British official has told the UN's anti-torture panel.\n\n \n http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article7331.htm\n \nU.S. to examine 4 insurgents' bodies\n \n Tests follow taped Fallujah slaying\n \n By Tom Bowman\n Tribune Newspapers: The Baltimore Sun\n \n 11/19/04 \"Chicago Tribune\" -- WASHINGTON -- The bodies of four Iraqi insurgents who died in the battle for Fallujah were expected at a U.S. Air Force base in Delaware for autopsies as part of an investigation into whether they were killed by U.S. forces after they surrendered or while they were wounded, Defense Department officials said.\n",
