   "If I were to make a legal argument for the right of gays to get married and I may very well do just that here in Missouri, it would go a little something like this... \n \n As we all know, during recent months we have seen an uprising of cases involving whether or not gays have the right to marry. Most notably the San Franciscio Mayor has been alleged to have violated State law by implementing gay marriage licenses in the city of San Franciscio. The Mayor contends that where he took and oath to uphold the constition, which cannot be presumed to mean only the State's, but also emcompasses the federal constitution as well. The Mayor was duty bound to avert violating the free speech and due process laws of both the State and federal Constitution. Accordingly, \"Public Officials sworn to uphold the Constitution may not avoid a constitutional duty by bowing to the hypothetical effects of private prejudice that they assume to be both widely and deeply held.\" Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U.S. 429, 433, 104 S. Ct. 1879, 1882, 80 L. Ed. 2d 421 (1984), quoting Palmer v. Thompson, 403 U.S.217, 260-61, 91 S. Ct. 1940, 1962-63, 29 L. Ed. 2d 438 (1971) (White,J., dissenting). And \n \"Congress may not enact discriminatory legislation because it desires to insulate heterosexual . . . from statements that might excite their prejudices,\" e.g. \"gay marriage\", because such effectively violates the first and fourteenth amendment provisions. \n \n \"The First Amendment recognizes the value of speech not only as an instrument, that is, a mechanism by which ideas may be exchanged, but also as an expression of personal dignity and integrity. Speech is worthy of First Amendment protection not only when it contributes to the \"marketplace of ideas\" or assists in the search for \"truth,\" but also when it articulates \"the promise of individual dignity and choice upon which our political system rests.\"\" Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15, 24, 91 S. Ct. 1780, 1788, 29 L. Ed. 2d 284 (1971). \"Those who won our independence believed that the final end of the State was to make men free to develop their faculties. . . . They valued liberty both as an end and as a means.\" Whitney v. California, 274 U.S. 357, 375, 47 S. Ct. 641, 648, 71 L. Ed. 1095 (1927) (Brandeis, J., joined by Holmes, J., concurring).\n \n The institution of marriage whether or not such consists of heterosexuals or gays, is nevertheless a recognizable platform for, which assists the people involved in openly promoting \"the promise of individual dignity and choice\" and the \"market place for ideas\". Therefore, where a government body seeks to implement restrictions on the right and liberty of marriage. \"The government may regulate its content only upon a showing that such regulation promotes a \"compelling interest\" and that the government has chosen \"the least restrictive means\" to further the interest.\" Sable Communications of California, Inc. v. F.C.C., 492 U.S. 115, 126, 109 S. Ct. 2829, 2836, 106 L. Ed. 2d 93 (1989). Thus, where the government body involved, fails to show a \"compelling interest\" existing and has failed to travel the road that is \"least restrictive.\" Then there can be no constitutional permissability to ban gay marriaages when such relies so heavily upon \"hypothetical effects of private prejudice that they assume to be both widely and deeply held.\"",

   "Behavior, Discrimination, and Marriage\n \n Comparing gay marriage to biracial marriages and civil rights is not a comparison. Myself a minority I feel insulted to have race compared with behavior. Laws in our land are all designed to govern behavior. We don't pass laws that govern race, gender, or ethnicity. We pass laws that we feel will protect society or advance a public interest. When there were laws in place banning interracial marriages, the laws were based on race. Jim Crow laws and every other law that based application on race are considered unconstitutional because they regulated race.\n Now every law we have now regulates behavior we feel is in the public interest. All laws are morally based. We say it's illegal to sell drugs. It is unlawful to be publicly lewd. It is permissible to sell pornography. Our laws are based upon our morals however we feel is right. Many times it doesn't make sense to everyone but it's what our legislatures believes is right and moral and therefore passes laws. We pass laws on the thought \"what is right for one is right for all.\" If same sex marriage were right for everyone they would pass laws protecting that. The legislature defines what is moral not the courts. They define it by the laws. When a court makes new laws they exceed their power. They should only interpret the law not create it. \n Many argue that it is not behavior but genetic. There is no definitive evidence that suggest homosexuality is genetic. There is as much evidence to suggest that homosexuality is genetic as there is to suggest that other behavior disorders are genetic. There are however thousands of \"gays\" who have changed. Many say that those that have changed were really not gays. If that is the case then drug addicts that quit were really never addicts.\n The fact is that we decide what should be moral by what we consider legal. Many make the argument that passing a marriage amendment would be discriminatory. If that is true everything in the constitution would be discriminatory. The constitution discriminates against naturalized citizens and citizens born outside the US from becoming President. It discriminates against citizens under 18 from voting. It discriminates against everyone from making Presidential appointments. It's full of discrimination. A constitutional amendment would guarantee that all men and women have the right to marry. It would give a gay woman as much a right to marry a man, as a straightl man to marry a woman. It is not discriminatory. It limits our behavior. We cannot marry multiple times, relatives, or same sex. It applies to everyone equally. Everyone has the same rights.\n Many do not believe that the institution of marriage is worth saving. They point out to the 50% divorce rate and the short lived marriages of celebrities. They point to the infidelity of spouses and various other problems with marriage. The fact is that most marriages do succeed. People that divorce, generally divorce multiple times skewing the 50% ratio. The fact that people fail at marriage does not necessitate lowering the standard of marriage. People that point to failing marriages and asking we lower our standards is like pointing to failing grades and asking schools to lower their standards. We should tighten up the requisites of marriage to ensure it isn't trivialized.\n Marriage has rights and protection. Gays want those rights and protections. Many others do too. Today we see many relatives and friends living together because financially or for health reasons cannot afford to live alone. They share the bills and grow to love each other. The love is not a passionate love of attraction. Shouldn't they have the same rights as gay couples? If we are to give gay couples \"rights\", give it to everyone. There are more that need it then gays. What makes them deserve it anymore than anyone else? Marriage is a commitment that men make to women and women to men to love them and provide for them and their children regardless of what happens. Marriage protects that commitment couples make to their wives and children. It is something that spans all cultures, races, and genders. We need to protect that not trivialize it. Marriage celebrates life. After all if it is right for one its right for all.",

   "Behavior, Discrimination, and Marriage\n \n Comparing gay marriage to biracial marriages and civil rights is not a comparison. Myself a minority I feel insulted to have race compared with behavior. Laws in our land are all designed to govern behavior. We don&#8217;t pass laws that govern race, gender, or ethnicity. \n\n \n In your reply, you speak a great deal about the \"law\", yet, as I read your reply, it was apparent that you misunderstand the law greatly. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 grants protection on the very foundations you say do not exist, such as race, gender, ethnicity, sex and national origin. Moreover, every state or city that has a hate crimes law, also bases the law on such things as race, ethnicity and so on. And customarily heterosexuals are given ten times more legal rights than gays have received. Not to mention, it is harder for gays to be legally represented by counsel in civil lawsuits, than it is for others. The prejudices and biases, even among the minority groups is overwhelming...strange as it is considering that these same groups then gripe and complain about being discriminated against themselves. So it seems they are not willing to give what they demand...such as respect, fair and equal treamtment, equality in justice and equal rights. \n \n In regards to your dissent against gay marriages being compared to racial issues, please try to understand that in the scope of the \"cause and effect\" of discrimination. There are obvious differences in what \"causes\" people to discriminate, but the \"effects\" often produce the same persecutions. And one cannot legimately focus only on \"cause\" to say there can be no comparison between the two, when it is the \"effect\" that holds more relevance in the harms created and endured.",

We pass laws on the thought \"what is right for one is right for all.\" If same sex marriage were right for everyone they would pass laws protecting that.\n\n \n Law in the United States does not exist to uphold an ethical standard. It exists to create order. It is illegal to sell drugs because they are harmful to public health and are therefore destructive to order. Public lewdness is offensive and infringes upon the rights of others. Pornography is private and voluntary. The legislature exists to protect the rights and safety of the people, not their diverse sets of morals.\n \n We pass laws believing that all people are equal under the law, not that \"what is right for one is right for all.\" What exactly do you mean by that, anyway? That what one person considers morally right is what another person considers morally right? Not true. Period.\n \n Our legislatures do not pass laws based on morality. They serve in the general interests of the public and make decisions to fit the needs of their constituents. This includes the removal of discrimination in government. \n \n \nMarriage has rights and protection. Gays want those rights and protections. Many others do too.

Marriage celebrates life. After all if it is right for one its right for all.\n\n \n You're right. Marriage is an institution based on the passionate love of attraction felt between a man and a woman. The rights endowed by marriage are endowed because they fit that kind of relationship, a connection that is rooted in romantic love. Homosexuals share that kind of love. They have the ability to raise a family, if not conceive children. They have the ability to make life-long commitments. They don't \"deserve\" marriage-resultant rights any more than a heterosexual couple would. But because they are American citizens, they are guaranteed to them. Equal protaection under the law, remember?",
