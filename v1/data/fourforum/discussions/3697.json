   "Lots of people are content to adopt a medieval world view - in which the lessons of bishops, the \"authority\" of scriptures, the meaning of myths, etc., condition their uncritical understanding of the natural world. Such people, whether they realise it or not, are not free: they are locked up inside an intellectual prison. \n Scientific thinking which is provisional, critical, and evidence-based opens up the natural world to rational enquiry: it gives you intellectual liberty. Of course, the natural world is complex, indifferent, and uncertain - so taking only reason as your guiding light can be a bleak and lonely experience. Is it any surprise then, that so many seek refuge in the comfort of a feather-bed of cosy religious certainties ?\n \n (Note that I'm NOT talking here about political freedom - which (to simplify) is having the liberty to live your life as you wish without interference from anything or from anybody, but under the rule of law).",

The problem with this is reason alone is not always the best way; especially if you start out with an incorrect assumption, as Mach does. Hence one of the criticisms of it's followers is...\n \"The cultic flaw in Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism is not in the use of reason, or in the emphasis on individuality, or in the belief that humans are self motivated, or in the conviction that capitalism is the ideal system. []The fallacy in Objectivism is the belief that absolute knowledge and final Truths are attainable through reason, and therefore there can be absolute right and wrong knowledge, and absolute moral and immoral thought and action. For Objectivists, once a principle has been discovered through reason to be True, that is the end of the discussion.[/b] If you disagree with the principle, then your reasoning is flawed.

It is an anti-intellectual pursuit, pretending to rationality.\n \n \n Oddly there are some social dimensions to it, include advocacy of rampant capitalism.\n \n \n *Hence he contradicts himself by saying something 'might' be unknowable\n \n Post #301 of \"Where does science say we come from\"\n \n \n \"Where\", would mean where the matter that makes us \"comes from\", or in generally, where the universe comes from. And that, we don't know. And we don't really know if it's even knowable....or relevant \n \n \n \n When...now \"when\" we came is known to some degree. How, is also fairly well understood.

It's more or less unintelligible to me, but I'm willing to enlarge my understanding where I can.\n\n I was basically saying that a powerful imagination and high degree of creativity can also be an indication of intelligence. The fact that some scientists place little value on these skills, does not mean that individuals who possess these talents are void of intelligence in comparison.\n \n In response to Mach's earlier post...\n \n Indicating that religion is criminal, ignorant or destructive in nature, is not really addressing the specific question of how scientific thought promotes a free mind. At this point I think the focus should be on science, although I guess religious thinking is one comparison we can make.\n \n I agree that many people find it necessary and rewarding to attempt to change the world, but this may simply be a vain attempt to deal with their own mortality, rather than the exercise of a free mind. Or maybe I'm being too judgemental, perhaps it IS a genuine attempt to help society. In such a case, how does this scientific thinking help an individual become free? When scientists are serving the community, aren't they really just sealing their fate as slaves to humanity! Apart from directing their research to appease the demands of society, they are also bound by rules of evidence and procedure. We naturally expect that any scientific claim will be vigorously tested by these parameters. In effect, these rules are far more constrictive than any religion or other philosophical thought, and are certainly not immune from the demands of others.\n \n To illustrate part of this, how do scientists fund their research? Does choosing research that gives the best possible chance of funding really indicate much freedom in their thinking? Isn't it true that scientists are constantly required to prove theories that are more focussed on selling non essential products, rather than pushing the frontiers of their understanding and knowledge?",

I said that if by \"scientism\" is meant the gathering and evaluation of knowledge about the MATERIAL world and the understanding of the same by the use of scientific method, then OK scientism is something I plead guilty to.\n\n No, scientism is the belief that ALL knowledge can be from science. Mach takes this path backwards as well; that all that can be known by science is all that is real; thus to him there is no 'non-material', 'super-natural' etc. If it can't be tested by science then it doesn't exist.\n \nAs for knowledge of the non-material world (the supernatural world ?), then I would be troubled by the concept of \"knowledge\" being used in this respect. A distinction between knowledge and belief is imperative here. When you put quotation marks around the word \"is\" (see above), I begin to wonder whether you feel you can slide from one to the other without taking pains to make clear that either you \"know\" or that you \"believe\" something is the case.\n\n Do you believe anything is non-material.\n \n I have stated 'darkness' is an example. Mach will not put up any evidence to dispute this. If you have some against my position, please do.\n \n I also offered the example of 'love' more than a month ago. His 'proof' is still missing. But he goes on with his mantra.",

   "\n \n I agree that many people find it necessary and rewarding to attempt to change the world, but this may simply be a vain attempt to deal with their own mortality, rather than the exercise of a free mind. Or maybe I'm being too judgemental, perhaps it IS a genuine attempt to help society. \n\n You're right, we cannot guess, neither you nor I. So maybe it's irrelevant, or needs to be tabled for now.\n \n \n \n In such a case, how does this scientific thinking help an individual become free? When scientists are serving the community, aren't they really just sealing their fate as slaves to humanity!\n\n \n Two different things. Anyone can use reason/scientific thinking. You don't need to be a career scientist!!!\n All artists use reason. When they dip their brush in green, they expect the paint to be green. When they press their pencil on the page, they expect pencil lines to result. When a musician hits a key, they expect the proper tone to result...etc.\n \n \n Apart from directing their research to appease the demands of society, they are also bound by rules of evidence and procedure. We naturally expect that any scientific claim will be vigorously tested by these parameters. In effect, these rules are far more constrictive than any religion or other philosophical thought, and are certainly not immune from the demands of others.\n\n \n It is easier to be incorrect, rather than correct. I believe this in general.\n However, we're talking about free. Since when was freedom \"easy\"? Nature holds us all in thrall, we cannot easily escape it. The only way to escape the doom nature has set forth for you is through the application of reason to gain knowledge (Science) that ultimtely results in a human consciousness being able to decide everything that a human consciousness can decide. That's freedom. Only acheivable through knowledge. That's the grand scale.\n \n On a smaller scale. A man decides not to work and has to hunt for food, build/maintiain a shelter, fuel supply (wood), cook, clean, stay healthy or die, etc.\n \n A wealthy achiever (through reason) earns enough income to kick back and think all day, if they get sick, best medicine money can buy. Cleaning? A maid. Cooking? A chef. Driving? A driver. Rear-end wiper? I'm sure that can be arranged...\n \n An another level, a woman artist decides to experess herself daily.\n With the most basic of charcoal on paper skills, she can express herself in charcoal drawings. With the knowledge of painting (Brush strokes, brush types, paint types, mixing paints, canvas prep, etc., etc.), she can CHOOSE either charcoal, or paint, and thus has more freedom of expression.\n \n --------------\n But ultimately it's how you define freedom.\n \n The first necessity for freedom is survival. To know best how to survive requires knowledge and the application of reason, and all things equal, will enhance your ability to survive...i.e. your freedom.\n \n In general, your comment about being correct as hard work, vs religion which is easy, I've seen written on a lot. Actually, my signature is meant to exemplify that very concept. Why struggle looking for existence when one can just make it up??\n \n PS. I apologize if I was off-the-railing at the outset...in dealing with certain illogical individuals I allow my patience to wear thin.\n \n -Mach\n \n *Back on track Master Shake!!

   "My understanding of \"non-material\" would be simply the absence of physical properties.\n\n I agree with you so far. Mach however says that this is nonsensical.\n To say non-material is made of no material, is for him illogical. (Conversely the dictionary definition for material doesn't phase him).\n \nThus \"darkness\" is merely a word that labels a condition that is described as the absence of light. I don't think we can go further than saying it's just an abstraction. \n\n I agree that it is a thing of no material. However, if you mean by abstraction that it is all in the mind this is false. Turn off all the lights and remove all light sources and try living a normal life; (try doing it while chanting \"This isn't real, it's only an abstraction\".)\n \nAs for \"love\", again an abstraction that we might define as a certain emotion that is actualised in the conscious mind when aroused by certain stimuli. (I know this sounds rather clinical, but it's the best I can do).\n\n It is possible that love is merely a reaction to stimuli. Does that make it 'real'? Or just in the mind?\n For me love is real, in the sense that it is not merely a thing in the mind. It is non-material. I have yet to see a materialistic test put forward (I challenged Mach to this more than a month ago, and am still waiting). Logically, if it's not made of material, it must be non-material. I don't need to know what non-material is made up of, because again the very idea that I can't show what it is made up of, means its non-material.\n \nSince a \"belief\" in something implies no more than a hunch that it might be true but there is insufficient or even no evidence to prove it, then my beliefs about \"non-materiality\" would be of no more consequence than anyone else's.\n\n If you mean you have a belief in the non-material that it 'exists' and that this belief is as just as someone who has any other belief, then I don't disagree in principle. Does that make your belief illogical? Mach says yes; any and all 'faith' (or belief) without 'evidence' (as in science) is irrational. That is why I claim his statement is insulting because I have a rational belief in the non-material. When I argued for religious people having a reasoned faith; and there's a huge tradition of great Christian thinkers, he argued that this was illogical. He doesn't agree about many of my statement, you might not either, but it is a totally different concept saying\n \"I don't agree with you; here's why...\"\n to saying\n \"You statement is illogical; no amount of evidence will convince me otherwise. Therefore your statement is illogical\". (and repeating this non-logical premise out at every occasion). (And offering no reason for this statement other then the statement itself).\n \nHowever, if I say I \"know\" something is the case, then I have to be prepared to offer reasoned evidence in support of my claim.\n\n Do you think that knowledge is completely encompassed by science? That is, all that can be known, can be known through science (this is 'scientism)?\n Again for Mach knowledge and what can be known by science are not separate. This is severely tested by the concept of the non-material; because a materialistic approach to science can't test for a non-material thing; hence because all that there 'is' can be known by science (according to him) then the non-material can not exist; oddly enough he is attempting to show therefore that darkness is material; by citing sites that test for light ?!?\n And again I find the stance, oft repeated, that my position is illogical, because it is, because it is, because it is, is insulting. That is why I may have seemed to have taken exception to your 'carte blache' acceptance of his earlier statement.",

It means you can get a Coke for that caffiene boost at lunch. But is it difficult? no. Is it useful to me? No. Is it Science? you bet. \n \n Let's put it this way. To even think about any concept, word, or otherwise, REQUIRES the use of \"reason\". You can of course, use reason to deny reason, or to think of concepts that cannot be addressed through reason, but it's foundation is, and for all practical purposes will aways be, reason.\n \n \n The agreement:\n \n I see what you're saying though, that the rigors of modern, or western, science, stifles some creativity. (same with all pure disciplines..journalism, writing, art, etc., etc.)\n \n I think that's primarily because of our economic system...money drives the entire system. Thinking is great and all, but if it doesn't produce results, what good is it? And when push comes to shove, do you want food, water, shelter, and heat, or do you want fairy-tale lollipops and bubble-gum skies? Well, mostly the former, but we do find time to fit in the latter :) And I think that's why the system works...it takes care of our primary needs, and we get to dabble in a little of the good-stuff :) although, as we know, work hard enough and you can retire early and enjoy lots of the good stuff...\n If you think of a way to get all the good stuff without having to deal with reality...send me a PM!\n \n Reality sometimes sucks.\n Can reality diminish one's enjoyment of fiction?

It tastes horrible\n 4. It doesn't require cooking in a deep fryer\n \n The scientist on the other hand:\n Laboratory tests reveal the compounds in this item do match the properties of an item of broccoli. Tests on other pieces of broccoli from this store and other stores have returned similar results. This is indeed a piece of broccoli. In testing several compounds in this item, we have found several nutrients that can be used by our body.

After publishing our results, we have received feedback from several other scientists who have been conducting similar experiments in this field that their own findings match my data. We can therefore recommend that a consumer buy the said product based on the above data. We believe the consumption of this product will be beneficial provided that the quality and preparation of the product remains unchanged in relation to the experiments we have conducted.\n \n So as you can see, the scientist has much more freedom of thought, when it comes to vegetable selection.",

   "How does the understanding of natural phenomena demonstrate more freedom of thought than the understanding of supernatural phenomena? The former is completely limited by physical evidence that serves to stifle the dimensions of thinking to a much larger degree than the latter. Your tool of enquiry is quite irrelevant in comparison.\n \n Brain washing aside, there are no rules of science binding an individual that is in touch with the supernatural. Therefore a higher degree of freedom of thought is a very possible outcome. I'm sure that that a large amount of the world's population can easily find the supernatural more liberating or purposeful than any scientific concept.\n \n However, considering the possible superiority complex that some of our scientific community appears to possess, I need clarification with the following question. Do you believe that a person's IQ increases or decreases proportionately with their ability to exercise free thinking? I wonder if any such preconceived beliefs are indicative of such freedom, when you prefer research over creation. My point is that it is simply a value judgement.\n\n The understanding achieved by reasoning about physical evidence is in stark contrast to the \"understanding\" you seem to believe can emerge from the consideration of \"supernatural phenomena\". Any knowledge of the latter can only by claimed by appeals to scriptures. magic, or some other non-verifiable source. In other words, the freedom that being in touch with what you call \"supernatural phenomena\", is really just the freedom to dream.\n There is no question of brain-washing here - the purposes of which are to make people believe without thinking, and this is essentially anti-scientific.\n Scientific knowledge does not arise from pre-conceived beliefs, one of the points of this debate is to argue the opposite.\n Creationism is a vast archive of unexamined assumptions, wishful thinking, and value-judgements: are you saying that scientific research belongs in this company ?",

I guess we'll have to differ on that one since I believe dreaming can be a form of free thinking, since it may or may not revolve around pre-conceived ideas and is not regulated. I should point out that even religion had a point of conception. Perhaps it was a clever mental exercise to deal with death that has since spiralled out of control!?!\n \n Obviously I still don't see why you need to base thought on evidence in order for it to be classified as free. As I've said before, it seems you are more focussed on the result, rather than the activity itself.\n \n I guess I just prefer to use a more flexible definition.",
