   "Iceland has refused to renew the lease for US military base located in Keflavik. It is well-known that US soldiers have been on Iceland's territory for last 50 years. But time has come when Iceland decided to put a stop to such military cooperation.\n And the reason of it is at the back of discourteous behavior of American side. The matter is that Americans have tried to organize secret tests of climatic weapons on this territory without permission and concordance of local authorities. No doubts that Iceland was obliged to smother this scandal in order not to damage relationships with so important partner as USA. But in spite of it Iceland has refused to extend the lease for US base, deployed at the island. Well, US soldiers have to leave this country during this year.\n Look, in Mass Media we saw some information about illegal US tests of new weapons. But earlier most part of those tests took place during military operations in Near East. But now Americans use own military bases all over the world for it.",

   "If the accusations toward Haliburton are legitimate, why does it continue?\n\n \n Because it is profitable even after the legal fees. And it's not exactly Haliburton per se. Most of the scandals in the past years have been directly related to KBR, rather then Haliburton itself. More then a few analysts have repeatively said that Haliburton would be better off spinning KBR into its own company rather then a subsidary. \n \n Still, Haliburtion has directly violated many US laws on sanctions. Haliburtion operates in Iran despite the clear sanctions. \n \n As for your $75 hammer, I suspect that is not actually the cost, merely the reallocation of funds in pentagon accounting (same thing for the $1500 toliet). Essentially it's cross subsidization on the books. They didn't actually charge $75.",
