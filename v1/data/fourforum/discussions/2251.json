   "ok, im making a piece of performance art which i am entitling \"escape from the midwest\" i play the lead role of a college grad who spent his entire life in one stinking area and now prepares to get as far away as possible, my car (79 camaro in stage 2 of restoration) will play a supporting role of getting me out of this hick infested hole at high speeds, while looking kewl at the same time\n so i need suggestions of music to accompany this exodus.......\n \n \n in case you are confused i am going to graduate college (someday, i keep adding new degrees to my list of wants) and i nedd as much music as possible to listen to on my road trip towards my future, any song with leaving or footloose value, general road song, and barring that a good classic rock song will do\n \n examples of what i have so far, steppenwolf, born to be wild (so cliche) lyrnrd skynrd freebird, and linkin park runaway\n \n any help would be appreciated\n i still have a few yrs til i graduate but i believe in starting early, plus its just great music, keep my mind off where i am\n \n Mathurin\n with every muscle strained i prepare to run",
