   "Congress: Biggest Gang of Thieves in History!\n by David Duke\n \n As I predicted earlier, Congress dutifully passed the 700 Billion Dollar Bailout, the biggest robbery in the history of the world. Hopefully, the American people will now finally understand that we no longer have representative government in this country. Every Congressman reported overwhelming opposition to bailout from their constituents. Almost all of them said that more than 95 percent opposed it. But the bailout still happened because it is the Jewish extremist elite that controls America, not the people of the United States. It comprises the most powerful lobby (AIPAC), provides most of the campaign financing of both parties (according to the Washington Post), dominates the Wall Street International corporations and Federal Reserve as illustrated by Goldman Sachs, and Ben Bernanke of the FED, and it thoroughly dominates and influences the mass media to support the Jewish agenda no matter where it leads. It has led us to the Iraq War and support of years of Israeli crimes against every true interest of the United States. It has even led to the coverup of Israeli terrorism against the United States. And now it has led to a gigantic double theft, the hundreds of billions they originally stole from the economy in this mortgage scam and now the additional hundreds of billions more they have stolen with the bailout. - God Save America! - Former member of the House of Representatives in Louisiana, Dr. David Duke",

   "Hi Jim, my only question in response to this thread is why would we care what a racist and anti semite like David Duke say's about anything? And why are you posting opinions of his with a straight face? I have always seen you as a much deeper and more substantial person than that. Was I wrong about you? emoticon_wow",

   "I'm not parroting anything, there are an awful lot of similarities between the way that fascist parties have gained support and the tactics used by Bush. The use of nationalism to deflect criticism and the attempts to cast criticism as treason, the use of nationalism and feigned religion to induce people to vote outside their class interest. The use of torture and illegal searches, and with no respect at all to McCarthy, the imprisoning of political opponents and abuse of state power to suppress dissent, as in the \"free speech zones\" set up to protect Bush from ever having to hear a dissenting voice. We'll add to that the merger of the corporation and the state, with privately armed paramilitary organisations fighting alongside the official military, and government contracts funneled to companies previously managed by senior administration officials. Stir in the setting up of false enemies: terrorism, gays, immigrants, it all sounds a lot like fascism to me. The line that is still to be crossed is resorting to mass murder of its own people to supplement its ends. Other countries' people, sure, but not its own just yet.",
