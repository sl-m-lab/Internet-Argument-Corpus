The unsuspecting reader gets taken through a maze of 'false delimmas' and manufactured intent which the author manufactures with misleading claims and outright deceit.\n \n I really don't think the author is that clever? I think his ignorance led to design to force the unsuspecting readers, by abuse of the 1A and violation of the two referenced clauses, to disavow the 2A as though a crime had been committed when in fact there was no crime! Taking the reader down the yellow brick road through a crafted maze of Constitutional innuendo and leading them to accept his emotional, false, pacifist standard,which is a violation of the Establishment Clause, while he cites violent dictators and murderers as the good guys in white hats.\n \n You mentioned it and I bolded it in your reply. I think that is the sum issue here and you can expound on it better than I. There was something missing in my synopsis that I couldn't quite put a finger on until I saw your passing mention of one of the protective clauses.\n \n Final point: just because a firearm is visible is NOT BRANDISHING!",

   "Not sure I follow what you are arguing, Doc. But I wonder if it was just the speech alone would the article have been written, or was it just because guns were present.\n \n It is not a crime to peaceably assemble. It is not a crime to do so while wearing a firearm. It is not a crime to quote Thomas Jefferson, no matter what others think of the wisdom of the quote. It is a crime, for example, to disrupt a meeting of a government body. See the following statute from my state:\n \n Willfully or being intoxicated, whether willfully or not, and whether such intoxication results from self-administered alcohol or other drug of whatever nature, disrupts any funeral, memorial service, or meeting of the governing body of any political subdivision of this Commonwealth or a division or agency thereof, or of any school, literary society or place of religious worship, if the disruption (i) prevents or interferes with the orderly conduct of the funeral, memorial service, or meeting or (ii) has a direct tendency to cause acts of violence by the person or persons at whom, individually, the disruption is directed. Virginia Code \u00a7 18.2-415\n \n Enforcement of this statute does not infringe upon the 1st amendment right to peaceably assemble and petition the government for a redress of grievances. \n \n It is a crime in my state to \"brandish\" a firearm:\n \n It shall be unlawful for any person to point, hold or brandish any firearm or any air or gas operated weapon or any object similar in appearance, whether capable of being fired or not, in such manner as to reasonably induce fear in the mind of another or hold a firearm or any air or gas operated weapon in a public place in such a manner as to reasonably induce fear in the mind of another of being shot or injured. Virginia Code \u00a7 18.2-282 \n \n Enforcement of this statute does not violate the 2nd. Amendment RKBA (assuming incorporation, which SCOTUS will decide this coming year). Wearing a firearm on your hip or slung over your shoulder does not violate this statute. So we need to know what actions the author of the article refers to with the comment \"the weapons-brandishing displays are 'intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population.' It sounds like the author wishes to use fear as a weapon to unconstitutionally restrict the RKBA.\n \n If someone wears a gun in a holster and spouts off about watering the tree of liberty, then I might disagree with them and even think they are being foolish, but no crime is committed-and neither I nor anyone else is justified in denying someone a nonviolent exercise of their rights merely because we don't like the right or disagree with the content of their speech. If, on the other hand, they say it's time to start watering the tree, pull out their gun, and waive it around, then they deserve to be prosecuted for brandishing a firearm. In that case neither their right of free speech nor their RKBA will prevent the prosecution, because neither right was intended to protect such conduct. \n \n The point I wanted to make was the article was less about seeking to hold someone accountable for their actions and more about using the example of a few as an excuse to mount an attack on a civil liberty.",

   "Not sure I follow what you are arguing, Doc. But I wonder if it was just the speech alone would the article have been written, or was it just because guns were present.\n \n It is not a crime to peaceably assemble. It is not a crime to do so while wearing a firearm. It is not a crime to quote Thomas Jefferson, no matter what others think of the wisdom of the quote. It is a crime, for example, to disrupt a meeting of a government body. See the following statute from my state:\n \n Willfully or being intoxicated, whether willfully or not, and whether such intoxication results from self-administered alcohol or other drug of whatever nature, disrupts any funeral, memorial service, or meeting of the governing body of any political subdivision of this Commonwealth or a division or agency thereof, or of any school, literary society or place of religious worship, if the disruption (i) prevents or interferes with the orderly conduct of the funeral, memorial service, or meeting or (ii) has a direct tendency to cause acts of violence by the person or persons at whom, individually, the disruption is directed. Virginia Code \u00a7 18.2-415\n \n Enforcement of this statute does not infringe upon the 1st amendment right to peaceably assemble and petition the government for a redress of grievances. \n \n It is a crime in my state to \"brandish\" a firearm:\n \n It shall be unlawful for any person to point, hold or brandish any firearm or any air or gas operated weapon or any object similar in appearance, whether capable of being fired or not, in such manner as to reasonably induce fear in the mind of another or hold a firearm or any air or gas operated weapon in a public place in such a manner as to reasonably induce fear in the mind of another of being shot or injured. Virginia Code \u00a7 18.2-282 \n \n Enforcement of this statute does not violate the 2nd. Amendment RKBA (assuming incorporation, which SCOTUS will decide this coming year). Wearing a firearm on your hip or slung over your shoulder does not violate this statute. So we need to know what actions the author of the article refers to with the comment \"the weapons-brandishing displays are 'intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population.' It sounds like the author wishes to use fear as a weapon to unconstitutionally restrict the RKBA.\n \n If someone wears a gun in a holster and spouts off about watering the tree of liberty, then I might disagree with them and even think they are being foolish, but no crime is committed-and neither I nor anyone else is justified in denying someone a nonviolent exercise of their rights merely because we don't like the right or disagree with the content of their speech.

The point I wanted to make was that the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise of any Right are hand in hand and are not mutually exclusive. Exercising a right such as one normally does under State Law is not suspended political speech either and is no more force than someone trying to demonize that right to KBA because someone objects to that specific civil liberty. Embellishing an incident by calling open carry \"brandishing\" is no more threatening than innacurate words to compel others to your point of view as the author has done.\n \n David Kopel has explored this issue to some extent and offered it to public discussion with some scattering like a bunch of quail :) It has been the subject of AG opinions which is interesting and informative...so we will let it go for now. Perhaps soon there will be a court case we can lean on?",
