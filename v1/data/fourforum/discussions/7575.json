   "I enjoyed the following letter in this mornings paper and thought I would share it.\n \n FRANKLY, I'M OFFENDED ... The only thing that offends me are people that are offended. After all, the very act of being offended finds its motivation in the notion that one is so right that any other view must be offensively wrong.\n I'm offended by Muslims who are offended by cartoons. I'm offended by those who are offended by the Rebel flag because they can't let anyone dispute their revised version of history.\n I'm offended by people that are offended by gay marriage when, odds are, they can't even make their own marriage work. I'm offended by those that are offended by me because I'm not offended by what they are offended at.\n Embassy fires would go out, nations would get along, races would fade to neutral and wars would not start if it weren't for people being so arrogant, self-absorbed, self-righteous and foolishly self-assured as to be offended by someone else's religion, politics or sexual preferences.\n Let me be the first to growl the one word that all offended parties should hear: \"Enough!\"",
