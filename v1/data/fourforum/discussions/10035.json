   "Priest muzzling aside, do you notice the huge, blatant lie the message was telling? They want you to believe that this bill will muzzle free speech, limit religious freedom, compromise morals, and kick your puppy. In fact, the bill provides federal assistance to local law enforcement investigating violent hate crimes. There has to be a crime, it has to be a felony, and it must be violent, otherwise this bill doesn't apply. I can't read the small print on the poster, but the gagged priest and the tag line clearly show the writers are trying to misinform their audience, and rather severely at that. Why do they feel the need to resorts to blatant lies? Do they have no real arguments to back up whatever their point is? Anyone know who's behind the \"High Impact Leadership Coalition\"? Clearly this is a group with no moral standards, and could probably stand to be kept an eye on.\n \n Here's a link to the actual bill:\n http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=s110-1105",
