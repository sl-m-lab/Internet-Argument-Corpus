By completely ignoring the arguments of your opponents?\n \n And the reason that it is hypocritical, is that you only believe homosexuality to be a choice because that's what makes you happy.

And on the other hand you have an actual homosexual, right here and now, who says that he did not choose to be that way any more than you chose to be a heterosexual. And this is not even somebody who has any motivation to choose homosexuality, being a Christian, for gods sake, he faces great adversity and personal conflict.\n \n And yet you claim to find more strength in the position of the former.

   "\"Our light of God\"? Is that how your name translates from the Latin?\n \n What can you tell me about Christianity that I do not already know?\n \n Perhaps you had better address your concerns to the \"ghostly legion of fallen priests.\" They are more in need of your comfort and concern:\n \n \nSeptember 12, 2006\n Editorial\n From Sacristy to Lockup \n No one knows the varieties of limbo being wandered these days by the hundreds of rogue priests the Catholic Church had to drop from service once its pedophilia scandal fully surfaced. Some became convicted criminals when prosecutors forced an end to diocesan cover-ups. Others who were accused, either too old to be defrocked or safely beyond statutes of limitations, are still financially supported by the church while denied priestly labor. The laity may well wonder what has become of these men. \n \n The New York Archdiocese has begun forcing a choice upon some of its fallen priests: agree to tight, indefinite therapy and housing containment or quit the priesthood and the diocesan payroll. Cardinal Edward Egan was wise to try this exercise in protection and repair - particularly since he was accused by the church's laity panel of earlier mismanagement of the pedophilia scourge. It's not encouraging that five of the first seven facing the choice quit the priesthood. But we hope the archdiocese does not see its responsibility ending there.\n \n For all the post-scandal display of reform by the American bishops, they still lack the machinery to force their foot-dragging peers to face up to tougher measures to regain public trust. The vague device called \"fraternal correction\" - a kind of buddy system that's supposed to correct blossoming scandal - remains a toothless nonthreat. Collective mandates are needed, especially as the church is haunted by its ghostly legion of fallen priests.\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/12/opinion/12tue3.html",

We need to fogive others it doesnt matter if they are Athiest, Pagan, Christian, muslim, Jew or other because these imperfections certainly belong to the fallen human nature of man that we all share and not the glorified divine nature of God that Christianity encourages us to asipre to.\n\n \n \n \n Christian leaders like Robertson, Fallwell, Dobson, Phelps all claim to speak for God and christianity. Not only do they claim to speak for christianity but if a christian does not think, speak, or believe as they do they are not true christians. They are reaching their 70*7 limit of forgiveness.",

   "What I know about Christianity:\n \n 1. One cannot prove that Christianity is true. One cannot prove that Christianity is not true. It is a matter of what one believes. I believe that Christianity (whatever that might be) very likely is not true.\n \n 2. This leads to a further problem. What, exactly, is Christianity? There is a myth in a book reverently referred to as the Bible which tells the story of the birth of a deity's son, supposedly born of a \"virgin.\" For some of those who call themselves Christians it is very, very, very important that this son of a deity be born of a \"virgin,\" furthermore, it is very important that this particular \"virgin\" be a \"virgin\" in perpetuity. It is very puzzling to me as to why there is so much ranting and raving about the \"virginity\" of this particular woman, as well as the \"virginity\" of women in general, when not very much attention is paid to whether or not men or a particular man is \"virginal.\" Was God the Father a \"virgin\" when he impregnated the \"virgin.\" Why is that question never asked?\n \n 3. Unfortunately, there is much more and even more complexity to this thing called \"Christianity\" and, most unfortunately, Christians have been warring among themselves and murdering each other for centuries because they cannot come to an agreement as to what this word \"Christianity\" means. This is quite upsetting to me, a nonbeliever, and serves to warn me away from such a contentious and murderous belief system.",

   "I live in the United Kingdom, it is a parlimentry deomcracy I have the right to vote as do others, majority rule is afair system because it seeks to satisfty the majority of People.... how I would vote is according to my beliefs that abortion is wrong and homosexual marriage is wrong too.\n\n \n Well played Matthew S :)\n \n Nostra, I think what Matthew was trying to elicit was precisely that admission: that you would happily use political means to legally impose the constraints of your religious beliefs - and impose them on others who might not share those beliefs.\n \n Homosexual marriage is incompatible with your vision of Christianity - fair enough. If someone wants to be the same kind of Christian as you, they must likewise eschew homosexual acts and homosexual marriage. This too is perfectly fine. Where things stop being fine is where you decide that even if others don't want to follow the same kind of Christianity as you, or don't even want to be a Christian at all, they should still be coerced into abiding by its restrictions.\n \n Parallels with paedophilia, moreover, are in my opinion unwarranted. A compelling, reasoned case can be made for outlawing paedophile relationships based on the deletorious mental, emotional and physical effects such relationships are observed to have on the younger parties, and the high correlation between paedophilia and broader social dysfunctionality in adults. To love, and desire to physically please another adult human being - who just happens to have the same genitals as you - is not, to my mind, comparable.\n \n The difficulty Christianity has here, as it always has, is that it cannot countenance sex as being anything other than selfish; a taking of something you want, a satiation of one's own appetites, only given a begrudging nod when it happens to coincide with an attempt to spawn another of the faithful. Thus homosexual acts, in which procreation is impossible, cannot possibly be anything other than immoral.\n \n Certainly sex can be selfish and base - but then again, so can preaching the alleged word of god. Sex can be a selfish or selfless, ugly or beautiful thing, whomever it is between and whether there's a god (or anyone else for that matter) watching or not. Unfortunately, your version of Christianity remains shackled to a stone-age interpretation of an act which - long before anyone got nailed to anything - had already evolved as many layers of nuance, meaning and significance as our every other social interaction.\n \n PS: I will endeavour to follow up other points soon; this post took a little time to compile and I find myself arriving late on the scene :)",

If that was the dominant religion in a particular country, yet the government was a secular democracy, would you agree with such a law being put before the public vote? The outcome would not be in doubt; would you feel it just and lawful to be forced to curtail your own behaviour in deference to the irrational majority?\n \n \nIf the country voted to outlaw homosexual marriage how then could you keep it legal and remain democratic,\n\n \n If that law ever reached the public forum, democracy has already gone out of the window.

When homosexual marriage - homosexuality itself for that matter - was legalised in Britain, it was not done so on the basis of a public vote, or majority rule. It was legalised because the law banning such activities was itself recognised as illegal. The public, however strongly they might feel, cannot vote for an illegal law.\n \n So, are you a good citizen? Can you really live and let live? Or are you just a 'good Christian'?",

   "I don't think she was referring to that, Ripskar. I think she was referring to St. Thomas Aquinas's famous teleological argument, or argument from design as it is also known. St. Aquinas was an Aristotelian religious philosopher who sought, like duce here, to prove the existence of god by sheer force of reason. This was back in a time before Hume or Kant when people really had a lot of faith in pure reason. Basically, the argument is that by the same common sense that we might find a watch on the ground and know that it was obviously created by some watchmaker, and that it did not just happen, so we should find that the world must have been created by some world maker, and this world maker is called God. This is because all of the clockwork of the universe, from the orbits of the planets to the way rain water flows right into rivers like its supposed to, to the way our own bodies are able to develop from the unformed matter around us supposedly could not have 'just happened.'\n \n This of course ignores the fact that, first of all, all of this clockwork of the universe, having no particular purpose, is entirely arbitrary, and doesn't really refer to anything else like a watch dose, complexity doesn't necessarily denote design. so, if, for example, I throw a handful of marbles on the ground, they would land in a very particular and complex arrangement, but it would also be an arbitrary arrangement. It would only suggest a designer if it referred to something, like a watch dose, the marbles would have to land in the shape of a square to suggest that I designed their arrangement.",

   "I agree, not only america but the western world is dying its lost its moral compass, its soul...its Christian foundation\n\n \n I would certainly agree that America is in trouble right now, and its moral compass is certainly askew, but not in the way you mean. Its founders made an extraordinary philosophical leap: having seen or experienced persecution for religious beliefs in Europe, they enshrined protection in the constitution - not for their religion, as you would expect - but for all to practice any religion, or none. They had the vision to understand it is the persecution that is wrong, not the religion that is right. \n \n Today America is in the grip of lesser men who believe they know better; that the laws of their country should reflect the tenets of their faith.\n \n An example: freedom of speech enshrines, not merely the right for a person to speak his mind, but more importantly the responsibility of listeners to be critical of what they hear. In other words, one should not expect the government to insulate you, or anyone, from opinions that differ from your own. Ideas must stand or fall in the public domain on their own merit. This is fundamental to democracy, and it is being actively undermined: unable to directly curtail freedom of speech, neo-cons seek to subvert it by undermining the public's ability to be critical. These days, 'skeptic' is an expletive; 'debate' is recast as 'stirring up controversy'; 'anti-war' is now 'anti-american'. \"Don't Think, Just Hate\" ought to be the Republicans' rallying cry.\n \n It's not conservatism per se I have a problem with. I'm quite happy for the neo-con sponsored Fox News, for example, to be a partisan organisation. What I see as dangerous are Fox's fraudulent claims to impartiality, including presenting staged or unbalanced debates to fool watchers into thinking they're seeing both sides of an argument. The neo-con movement doesn't only believe itself to be right - all movements or parties by definition believe that - but also that its agenda is more important than the democratic process itself; that where they want to lead the country is more important than the country's right to choose whether to follow.\n \n Then there's the right to bear arms, enshrined in the constitution by thoughtful men who would not see their free country fall into the hands of a dictator without a fight. And in those simpler times, firearms are what you would need to stave off or overthrow dictatorship. Yet today the spirit of that law, the why of it, is being deliberately obscured in the endless bickering over its letter. The neo-cons are quite happy to staunchly and loudly defend your right to own a firearm, regardless of the cost in human life, both because it makes them look strong on American values and because... well, what defence is a firearm against a tightening media monopoly? How will owning a gun help you stop the government spouting lies about terrorism and WMDs? Truly the pen is mightier than the sword, and consequently it is the pen the neo-cons wish to remove from the people's arsenal. \"You Can Keep Your Guns!\" they shout, and smile as the public, missing the irony and disarmed nevertheless, cheer and vote for them.\n \n There is no clearer spoor of the American government's opportunism in the years since 9/11 than the steady and inexorable erosion of the very freedoms they claim the terrorists themselves despise. Whenever some new bill passes through the house granting wiretaps without judicial approval, or detainment without trial, the same worried, hopeful, average-joe Americans are wheeled out on the news to trot out the neo-cons' favourite line: \"If we need to sacrifice some of our freedoms in order to be safe, well, so be it.\"\n \n The one fact that gives me heart, as I watch the devious machinations of the Bush administration, is that they need those devious machinations to get their way. Americans are, when given the chance, an extraordinarily tolerant and enlightened people, and Bush & Co know only an artificial climate of fear can distract Americans from their country's ideals.\n \n \nSo if I want to rob someone etc that is fine because my rights take precedence over the majority who have said robbery is a crime ?\n\n \n I think you know perfectly well that's not what's being argued. If you really can't see the difference between the 'right' to rob someone else and the right not to be forbidden to eat pork in a predominantly Jewish country, you need to do some hard thinking :)",

   "Going off and killing someone because I want to is an example of an absolute right to to what I want and was meant to be a starting point.\n\n \n There is no right to kill who you want in any consistent system of rights, democratic procedures do not need to \"kerb\" such a right.\n \n \n\n However to have full freedom to do anything you want usually requires some sense of responsibility.\n\n \n The \"full freedom to do anything you want\" is not a system of rights, for example \"freedom of speech\" does not mean \"do anything you like\", it means there are certain things you cannot do, namely get together with your friends and pass a law prohibiting criticism of the republican party.\n \n \nHowever I do not believe there are any such rights in absolute terms. What we call rights have been evolved by human thinkers and experimenters over the millenia to try and create a society in which we can all be confortable.\n\n \n Ok and suppose these have been invented, why would we replace such a society with one in which only ethnic and religious majorities can be comfortable, while minorities live under constant threat of oppression by the majority? Why would you want to replace a society of individual rights where people can live comfortably with one where people have no rights and the government can arbitrarily abuse them with its power? Because that is what is happening in America as the executive branch (the heart of the majority) is gaining power and constitutional protections are being eroded.\n \n \nI do believe that individual/minority rights have a place and can be catered for. However the majority will decide what society we desire to live in and will or should try and strike a balance between the common good and individual wishes.\n\n \n Again you're ascribing this telos to the majority, there's no reason to believe it will try and balance these things, or that is holds any kind of unified opinion at all.",

   "Well you seem to have conceded that there must be kerbs. This has been my point all along\n \n If so then the only remaining thing is to work out the balance.\n \n How that is done is for the society in general. Yes I tend to agree (I'm in UK by the way) that too much power is being concentrated in the hands of the executive to the detriment of the individual.\n \n Despite the extremely flawed Human Rights act there are signs in it where the balance could be restored. Unfortunately on the basis of 'pan et ludi' the majority populace have sunk in to apathy; an extremely dangerous situation.\n \n Nevertheless unless you can provide a viable alternative society as a whole has to work to get the balance between individual rights (which should prevail where possible) and the rights of that society as a whole",

Your point all along has been that there should be no \"kerbs\" to majority power - that majority power should be enforced regardless of how idiotic or unjust it is.\n \n \nYes I tend to agree (I'm in UK by the way) that too much power is being concentrated in the hands of the executive to the detriment of the individual.\n\n \n And yet you would remove the withered remnants of individual protections so that the majority can assert its divine will through the omnipotent government.\n \n \n\n Nevertheless unless you can provide a viable alternative society as a whole has to work to get the balance between individual rights (which should prevail where possible) and the rights of that society as a whole\n\n \n \"Society as a whole\" is nothing more and nothing less than all the individuals in it put together, striking a balance between the rights of \"society as a whole\" and \"individuals\" is nothing more than a euphemism for going against the rights of the individual.",

   "What are these rights ? Are they some divine gift which stretch above anything else ?\n \n I have never advocated removing anything from individuals, only acknowledging that there is sometimes conflict and please note also that the majority (which you deride) are also individuals.\n \n I have advocated a balance and by that there must automatically be kerbs on both sides so that a balance may be achieved between the Individual and the society in which he lives as a whole.\n \n Kerbs are there also from a practical point of view. Why should you have to take a driving test ? That protects every other individual from you running amok with something you can't control properly ? (or at least gives them a slight chance)\n \n Can you envisage a society where there are no kerbs at all on an individual ?\n \n If not, then how do you propose that such kerbs (laws if you will) be created, maintained and debated ?\n \n In short how do you expect a Society to function ?",
