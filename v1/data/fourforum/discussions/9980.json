   "I recently found this excellent resource.\n \n Hemant Mehta, in Human Migration: A Brief History, has reported on a nice Flash presentation of humanity's Paleolithic migrations: Journey of Mankind: Peopling of the World.\n \n It focused on our present human species, mentioning the Neanderthals, Homo erectus, and H. floresiensis only peripherally; it would have been nice for the map to show their distribution also.\n \n But that aside, it had lots of helpful additional information that one can get by pressing appropriate buttons in the map, like explaining ice ages, the Toba volcano, living on seashores, the mitochondrial Eve and Y-chromosome Adam, etc.\n \n It is an animated map that shows the lines of migration growing from one step to another; you press a button to go to the next step.\n \n The steps:\n \n 160 kya - Homo sapiens originates in east Africa; the map's position is little north of Lake Victoria\n \n 135 kya - humanity reaches eastern and southern Africa; time of the Herto fossils (H. s. idaltu).\n \n 115 kya - Interglacial; Africa was relatively wet, allowing humanity to spread to the Levant, the eastern Mediterranean coast from the Sinai Peninsula to Anatolia/Turkey.\n \n 90 kya - Those Levantines died out as a result of a global cold snap that turned the Levant and north Africa into extreme desert. Neanderthals later moved in.\n \n 85 kya - the ancestors of all non-Africans crossed the Gates of Grief strait at the southern end of the Red Sea.\n \n 75 kya - these people spread along the south Asian coast, reaching south China.\n \n 74 kya - In Indonesia, Mt. Toba erupts, complete with a sound effect . It creates a 6-year \"volcanic winter\" followed by a 1000-year cold snap. Humanity suffers a population crash to about 10,000 individuals, and dies out between Iran and Indonesia.\n \n 65 kya - Humanity repopulates the southeastern-Asian coastline, and spreads into New Guinea and northern Australia.\n \n 52 kya - The climate warmed, and humanity spread further into Australia, the coastline of India, and into the Fertile Crescent, finally returning to the Levant.\n \n 45 kya - A mini Ice Age followed by some short warm periods; the Cro-Magnon people spread over Europe.\n \n 40 kya - Humanity spreads into Spain, north Africa, and central and eastern Asia.\n \n 25 kya - Cold period. Humanity spreads into northern and northeastern Asia.\n \n 22 kya - Humanity reaches North America, crossing the then-high-and-dry land of Beringia and making it through the Canadian-Rockies ice-less corridor.\n \n 19 kya - Big Ice Age; northern Eurasia and North America were largely depopulated except for a few refuge areas.\n \n 15 kya - The Last Glacial Maximum. Humanity makes it into South America.\n \n 12.5 kya - The glaciers start to retreat and the climate becomes moister. Humanity has now spread over much of North American and all of South America.\n \n 10 kya - As the glaciers continue to repeat, humanity continues to repopulate northern North America.\n \n 8 kya - Humanity spreads further in north Africa, repopulates north Asia, and enters the British Isles and Scandinavia. Agriculture invented in several places: the Levant, south China, New Guinea, Mexico, and the lower Amazon River.\n \n Overall, it misses a few small cultures that advanced in places that are not shown, but it shows the major migrations, etc.",

Dillehay\n \n About 14,600 years ago, humans first appeared in south central Chile. But the arid regions of the Atacama desert in northern Chile were not populated for another 2000 years, and human occupation of this region subsequently remained intermittent. In his Perspective, Dillehay highlights the report of N\u00fa\u00f1ez et al., whose integrative archaeological and paleoecological study shows that climate was the key factor in these human migrations. The study illustrates the power of an integrative approach to understanding the relation between human societies and climate change.\n \n Science 13 May 2005:\n Vol. 308. no. 5724, pp. 936 - 937\n DOI: 10.1126/science.308.5724.936a\n \n Prev | Table of Contents | Next\n News of the Week\n MICROBIOLOGY:\n Global Spread of Leprosy Tied to Human Migration\n David Grimm\n \n On page 1040, microbiologists use rare DNA differences among leprosy strains culled from various corners of the world to infer an East African or Near East origin of the disease.\n \n cience 15 December 2006:\n Vol. 314. no. 5806, p. 1653\n DOI: 10.1126/science.314.5806.1653f\n \n Prev | Table of Contents | Next\n This Week in Science\n Modern humans are thought to have dispersed out of Africa along a single southern path--from the Horn of Africa across Bab-el-Mandeb (the Gate of Tears) to the Arabian Gulf and then along the coasts of the Indian Ocean to Southeast Asia and Australasia, a migration route consistent with the known distribution of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genetic markers. Curiously, haplotypoes M1 and U6, which are closely related of some of the predominantly Asian halogroups, are specifically found in North and East Africa. Olivieri et al. (p. 1767) sequenced a wide-ranging series of M1 and U6 mtDNA genomes and found that populations bearing these markers must have arisen in southwestern Asia and then returned to North and East Africa some 40,000 to 45,000 years ago, at a time when changes in climate created fragmented deserts in these areas. Ancestral M1 and U6 populations apparently moved through the Levant when populations from this area were moving into Europe.\n \n cience 7 March 2003:\n Vol. 299. no. 5612, pp. 1582 - 1585\n DOI: 10.1126/science.1080857\n \n Prev | Table of Contents | Next\n Reports\n \n Traces of Human Migrations in Helicobacter pylori Populations\n \n Daniel Falush,1 Thierry Wirth,1 Bodo Linz,1 Jonathan K.

These modern populations derive their gene pools from ancestral populations that arose in Africa, Central Asia, and East Asia.

Cann\n \n Ongoing debate about proper interpretation of DNA sequence polymorphisms and their ability to reconstruct human population history illustrates a important change in perspective that we have achieved in the past 20 years of population genetics. To what extent does the history of a locus represent the history of a population? Tools originally developed for molecular systematics, where genetic lineages have been separated by speciation events, are routinely applied to the analysis of variation within our species, with conflicting results. Because of automated technologies and linkage analysis, we are poised to harvest a wealth of information about our past, if we are successful in moving beyond a current polarization regarding models of human evolution. Rather than just suggesting that true resolution will only come by considering fossil or archaeological evidence, the realistic and appropriate application of genetic models for analysis of population structure is also necessary. Three examples from different dispersal events are highlighted here. \n \n Science 11 April 2003:\n Vol. 300. no. 5617, pp. 318 - 321\n DOI: 10.1126/science.1081449\n \n Prev | Table of Contents | Next\n Reports\n \n Early Origin and Recent Expansion of Plasmodium falciparum\n \n Deirdre A.

Here, we provide genetic evidence for a sudden increase in the African malaria parasite population about 10,000 years ago, followed by migration to other regions on the basis of variation in 100 worldwide mitochondrial DNA sequences. However, both the world and some regional populations appear to be older (50,000 to 100,000 years old), suggesting an earlier wave of migration out of Africa, perhaps during the Pleistocene migration of human beings.\n \n And one more:\n cience 11 August 2006:\n Vol. 313. no. 5788, pp. 796 - 800\n DOI: 10.1126/science.1128402\n \n Prev | Table of Contents | Next\n Review\n Going East: New Genetic and Archaeological Perspectives on the Modern Human Colonization of Eurasia\n Paul Mellars\n \n The pattern of dispersal of biologically and behaviorally modern human populations from their African origins to the rest of the occupied world between ~60,000 and 40,000 years ago is at present a topic of lively debate, centering principally on the issue of single versus multiple dispersals.

   "I doubt he would ever use a quote that ends with a preposition, wherever he is at.\nGenerally, American pedants (mostly my high school English teachers) seem to take glee in pointing out how incorrect it is to end a sentence with a preposition. However, none of them, to my knowledge, studied or spoke another language, earned a degree in linguistics, or met Winston Churchill. I have studied three languages and speak two (nobody speaks Latin) and have a degree in linguistics. I only know stories about Sir Winston. One story goes like this: It seems that Sir Winston wrote own speeches by listing the points he wished to make. He gave this list to his speech writer who produced a draft. Sir Winston then read the draft and made notes and corrections and returned it to the speech writer. The process continued until the speech was what Sir Winston desired. It seems that on one occasion the speech writer corrected a phrase from Sir Winston and made the note that one should not end a sentence with a preposition. Sir Winston put back his original words and added the note, \"This is the type of errant pedantry up with which I shall not put.\"\n \n Sir Winston's point was that in English, certain verbs, by concept, include what seems to be a preposition. In fact, almost universally across other languages, ideas expressed by these peculiar verb+preposition combinations are a single, unique verb. For example, \"to put up with\" in Spanish is the verb \"tolerar\", that has no relation to the verb \"to put\" - \"poner\". In Spanish, there is a different verb \"to look for\" (buscar) than \"to look at\" (mirar).\n \n However, in this case, Foxtuba is 100% correct. Neither the verb \"to be\" nor the verb \"to evolve\", in any language, has a linguistic concept that includes a preposition. Thus, \"to be at\" and \"to evolve from\" are both incorrect as the end of a sentence.\n \n As we used to say back when I studied linguistics, \"Never use a preposition to end a sentence with.\" - except when it is conceptually part of the verb.",
