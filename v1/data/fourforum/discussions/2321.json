   "Girls 'poisoned by militants for going to school' \n \n Greg Bearup in Islamabad\n Monday May 3, 2004\n The Guardian \n \n Three young girls in eastern Afghanistan were in critical condition in hospital last night after being poisoned, apparently by militants as punishment for attending school. \n The Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, said those responsible for the poisonings, in the province of Khost, were less than human. He said the attack had been carried out by terrorists and was the work of foreign elements. \n \n \"I will not call anyone an Afghan or a Muslim who poisons an eight-year-old child because she is schoolgoing,\" Karzai said. \"They are beasts.\" \n \n Vikram Parekh, from the International Crisis Group, said there had been a series of attacks on girls' schools, particularly in the south of the country, in recent months but this was the first time children had been attacked. \n \n \"A girl's school was recently burnt to the ground in Kandahar and others have been attacked, but this is a horrible development to see that the girls themselves would be targeted,\" he told the Guardian. \n \n Few details of the incident were available last night, but militants are angry about the Karzai government's reversal of a Taliban ban on female education. Attacks on schools have also taken place in Pakistan's neighbouring North West Frontier Province . \n \n More than four million students are enrolled in schools this year - more than ever before - including one-third of the country's girls. But the transition has not been without problems and many conservative families still refuse to send their daughters to school. \n \n The poisoning followed a weekend of violence in Afghanistan after US troops killed four people. According to the US military, it launched the attack when one of its convoys was attacked south of Kabul. \n \n A US spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel Michael DeWerth, said two American soldiers had been injured in the attack. \n \n \"Four unidentified anti-coalition militia troops were killed, two [militants] were injured and were taken for medical care, and two [militants] were detained,\" Lt Col DeWerth said. He said the US had used air support to attack the militants, but provided no other details. \n \n But Afghan officials disputed this version of events and said those killed had been Afghan police. The provincial police chief, General Haygul Salemankhel, told Associated Press the shooting had taken place because of a mix-up as the convoy approached a police checkpoint under cover of darkness. \n \n He said three of his men had been killed and two injured, and that the wounded men were being treated at the nearby US base. \"Because of a misunderstanding, they open-ed fire on each other,\" Gen Salemankhel said. \n \n \u00b7 An accidental explosion at a gas station has killed at least 25 people in western Afghan-istan, the government said. At least another 40 were injured in the blast near Shindand, 360 miles west of Kabul.",

   "These people will go to any length to further their cause. It seems even worse when they target innocent children.\n \n We don't seem to hear much about the war in Afganistan lately, unless it's to report casualties . Our mission there seems to be less than sensational to the news media. \n \n Our presence in Iraq is drawing all of the media attention, which is sad. I believe our mission in Afganistan is just as important. At least we had a legitimate reason for that conflict.",
