   "AMD4EVER,\n \n Christianity: I know that a major invasion of Israel is to be expected with the final battle on some great plains. (I don't remember the names). Napoleon called these plains: Natures best fighting grounds. Something along those lines anyways.\n Christianity also includes the anti christ coming to power along with a false prophet.

(Same goes for Christianity)\n \n Me: I think the next war will be a nuclear holocaust of great proportions. I think it will wipe out the world as we know it today and knock us back to a sort of a stone age. Assuming that some survive. But thats just a guess.....\n Forgive my spelling...

   "Well since everyone seems to be listing the normal views of Armageddon, I'll list an alternate one. I'm a Partial Preterist, so my views are different in regards to Armageddon as noted in the Bible, specifically in the Book of Revelation. \n \n To a Preterist, whether Full or Partial, Armageddon Biblically happened when Rome laid seige to Jerusalem and all but destroyed it between 66 through 70 AD. That is what John was prophesizing about in Revelation. Towards the end of Revelation, starting at chapter 20, there is a last war, listed, but it is very brief and ended by God before it truly begins. But as far as Armageddon, or the Tribulation, that's passed. \n \n Islam in turn believes generally that there will be a war between the Jews and the Muslims with the Muslims being victorious. Then Jesus will return, yes Jesus, and people will be given one last time to convert to Islam. \n \n Suede",

Shouldn't a time of great peace have occurred afterwards or a time of great troubles followed by the actual return of Jesus?\n \n \n \n Anyways, my views on Armageddon are really fueled by the phrase \"Kings of the East\" and \"Million man army\" which is mentioned in the Bible as one of the sides that would fight in the final battle. With China quickly become a dominating force in the East, I think they are the ones the Bible is talking about.

Russia begins fighting against the Chinese in the Middle East near Israel. A major dam in Turkey is closed off to prepare the battle of Armageddon.

No offense meant. This is currently the popular view, it actually has been for about 100 years or so. But, it's not the only view. And the issue should be, is it the right view? I don't think it is and we can get more in depth if you would like, but I'll address a few of the things you did bring up. One, there's a LOT of land East of Jerusalem before you hit China. A LOT. Particualarly when John was writing Revelation, back when you typically walked to places. China is doubtful, and here's why I say that. The Bible explains the Bible. Oddly, most people understand that, however, they don't do this when it comes to Revelation? Why? I'm not sure either. China isn't found in the Bible. As far as the 2 million man army, we have to ask, in this vision, or prophecy, was John being literal? Doubtful. Prophecy is usually highly symbolic, and John was most likely describing a VERY large army. But if one feels it is literal, then they need to have it be literal. 2 million indeed, not one more, not one less. \n \n +++Supposidly NATO is the force that eventually stands up against them as the Chinese approach the Middle East. Russia begins fighting against the Chinese in the Middle East near Israel. A major dam in Turkey is closed off to prepare the battle of Armageddon. Finally the power of God is released on the armies where a third of all people die and the armies of both sides are completely eradicated thus ending the final war.+++\n \n Yes this is more of a Futurist view point as well. But, doesn't necessarily fit with what John was talking about. Well let me know if there is a specific question, if you have one that is. Take care,\n \n SUEDE,\n \n Revelation 1:1 \"The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave Him to show to His bond-servants, the things which must soon take place.....\"",

   "suede, I really don't have a question but also agree, I probably am a futurist and my ideas about the final battle are pretty typical. China is just something I hate to think of as being a possible Superpower. They will one day be equal to the power Russia had during the Cold War. Another communist country battling it out to become the best in the world against the US. And this time I fear the US will lose. That is somewhat based on the Bible, somewhat based on my ideas about the world, and somewhat my own paranoia.\n \n Anyways before I forget, I gotta share this link to a NWO (New World Order) site about a China v US war and how things can be resolved peacefully. It really is very funny and the graphics are interesting :)\n \n http://alexchiu.com/philosophy/corp.htm",
