   "Esdraelon, once again, I see where you are coming from. \n \n THE PLAIN FACTS:\n Polygamy, or the practice of having more than one wife was indeed practiced by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day saints, for several decades. What I was referring to in my list is the current practice. I have had numerous people attempt to convince me that polygamy is a current lifestyle practiced by my religion. This is false. It was discontinued over a century ago in compliance with US law. Official Declaration 1 This is a link to an official LDS declaration that affirms the discontinuance of the practice. \n \n HOW/WHY IT STOPPED:\n The following link is the \"Articles of Faith,\" 13 points of our basic doctrines. \n Articles of Faith 1\n #12 refers to our beliefs in complying with law. Regardless, most of the reasons that polygamy was implemented were by that time no longer existent. I'll touch on that more in a minute.\n \n WHY PEOPLE THINK WE STILL PRACTICE POLYGAMY:\n There are many fringe groups claiming to be \"Mormon\" that still practice polygamy. I assure you that they are not. Any person practicing polygamy is excommunicated from our church. Notwithstanding that, I can't tell you how many people ask me, \"How many wives does your dad have?\" To which I would reply, \"Seven. How many does your dad have?\" And then I'd enjoy their expression for a second, before telling them the truth, that any true LDS will have only one spouse. I admit, I love messing with people. I know, I really shouldn't... \n \n WHY WE EVER DID:\n This is tricky to answer in any way that be relevant to any that are not of my faith. There are many reasons that have been claimed by LDS and non LDS alike. Some are true, some have elements of truth, some are merely possibilities and some are complete fabrications.\n The first reason is simply that we believe that it was the will of the God. We believe that we are lead by living prophets, and as Amos 3:7 says, God reveals His will through prophets. \n There are reasons that can be more universally understood, if not necessarily accepted. The LDS church was heavily persecuted at the time. For example, Missouri had an extermination order out for Mormons. Any Mormon had to leave the state, abandoning their property with no compensation, or be killed. Many of our men were killed in attempting to protect their family and property. Very few of our women were killed. Beyond this, there were more female converts to our church than male, leaving a heavy gender imbalance. As you may know, in the the 1840's, women led a very different life. Society was set up for men, making it hard for a women to earn a living or own property. This is even more true of the widow with small children. How will she take care of a family? Marriage was a lot more important in those days. So several women were married to one man.\n Even at it's peak, polygamy was very limited, never being practiced by more than 3% of the LDS population. Even then, it wasn't a volunteer system. Men were called to it specifically, typically ones who could afford to provide for more than one family. Many of the plural wives were never sexual partners of their husbands; but they were provided for by the husband. These plural wives always had to give their consent, and were never forced into such arrangements. \n After several decades of this practice, the US law came down forbidding plural marriage, and we stopped the practice. By that time it wasn't needed anyway. The US government wished for all of the plural marriages performed before the law was enacted to be nulled. We agreed to not perform any more marriages, but many of the men refused to divorce their plural wives, leaving them unsupported. They served their time.\n \n Some offer the explanation that our polygamist practices were simply the ultra-conservative following of the Bible, Exodus 21:10, Abraham and Jacob (Israel,) being several examples. I think this may have been part of it, but I give more weight to the material circumstances of the time. \n \n Any questions? I'm thinking next time I'll post some theories that American historians have postulated as to why we had such troubles in that era, and specifically in Missouri. \n \n Esdraelon, you seem to have some questions about Joseph Smith.",

And they lived unmolested lives by both the church and the local law enforcement.

My question, is that when Joseph Smith used his seer stones to find buried treasure, or to find a needle in a haystack for Martin Harris, was he being guided by God? Yes/No.\n \n Ok, let's take this one first.",

   "Esdraelon, I'm impressed. Although you bias is still clear, and your understanding of the context and actual meaning of the text you quote is incomplete, your last post shows a much wider knowledge than I would have previously given credit for. I'm just barely out of class, and don't have time to respond to you yet, but be assured that I will in a minute. I will be more than happy to clear up those points. I meant in no way to dodge the \"Eternal Progression\" point. There have just been so many posts that I can't keep up with them all. Easyrider, I haven't forgotten your question either.\n \n First, to finish polygamy, and Archangel's question:\nEverything you say here is absolutely true according to the official church press release. But I used to drive by a quite expansive walled in polygamous compound...every day... This compound was no more than 25 miles from the Temple downtown in a densely populated area where everyone knew what they were.\n This is true. There are also practicing devil worshipers within 5 miles of The Vatican, but they are not Catholic. The members of that compound or any like it are NOT members of my church, just like Lutherans are not Catholics. They split off and began doing their own thing. We do not endorse, sponsor, or support them in any way. We disapprove of their practice, and are not involved in their practice. Many of their teachings, including polygamy, contradict our own.\n \n \nAnd they lived unmolested lives by both the church and the local law enforcement.\n We believe in separation of church and state, and therefore as an LDS, I have no more influence than any other citizen. What should I do, turn vigilante? I believe it to be wrong to take the law into one's own hands. \n \n \nAny prosecutions which ever took place against polygamists while I lived there were executed by the Federal, not State prosecutors, if memory serves. And then, only because the husband took 3 or 4 wives and appeared on National TV in defense of plural marriage. \n \n The church has a public policy against it, but privately they have never enforced any rules against polygamy.\n Once again, we are a church, not law enforcement.We have made rules against polygamy. As a church, they are the most severe rules we can make. We can excommunicate them, and we have already done that. What are you suggesting we do?",

   "I know first hand the political clout the Mormon Church enjoys there, and wields when it serves their purpose. If the LDS Church really wanted polygamy wiped out in Utah, it would have been wiped out a century ago.\n They follow a different leader, not our prophet, and have occasionally forced marriages between cousins, and under-aged cousins at that. If you knew as much as you claim about my religion, you would know that having fundamentalist radicals who create no end of bad press, and call themselves \"Mormon\" on national TV is undesirable. They are no friends of ours, and do us no favors. We have no reason to do them any favors. \n \n Given what you say your \"LDS\" friends told you, I am beginning to doubt the validity of your claim be a Utahn and to know things about my religion...\n \n \nThere's a reason why they own both Newspapers in Salt Lake City. And they have influence at every level of state government. \n They own one, and both run stories from time to time showing the church in a negative light. They are run independently. \n \n This is quite the conspiracy theory you are working on here...\n \n \nAnd you must or should also know that Utah remained a territory and was denied statehood for decades until she would finally agree to outlaw polygamy. In other words she did it very begrudgingly in order to gain the benefits of statehood. \n As I said, it was practiced for decades. Polygamy was not outlawed in Utah when it was a territory, that it true. However, if it was only to receive the benefits of statehood, then one might ask why we didn't give in decades before? Believe as you like. Choose your own reasons. \n \n \nSo your matter of fact statements which paint the church in the most innocent and upright light leaves much to be desired.\n As do yours to paint us as the most disgusting lecherous lumps to ever defile the earth. I admit, wrongs have been done on all sides. As i like to say so often, \"God had a perfect church, until he let people into it.\" Even Christ had a Judas. No organization deserves to be judged because of the bad apples. \n \n \nAnd I realize that we haven't really gotten into the meat of the doctrinal failures the church follows which are in direct conflict with the holy bible, and that includes the book of Mormon which is extra biblical material which has no place in any spiritual discussion.

The answer to that question is most assuredly YES.\n This is true, some LDS doctrines do. Yet, for me, that is hardly a deal-breaker. That's like a Hindu warning you that your beliefs are not in keeping with the Upanishad. If I believed that the Protestants were right, I would be Protestant. However, there are many religions recognized as Christian which are not Protestant. Protestants believe in Christ, but are not the only Christians.",

   "I still have a life outside this forum. I would like to ask that you hold off the questions and posts for tomorrow so that I have a chance to respond to what has already been asked/claimed/whatever.\n \n I am going to use only the Bible as scriptural text in this part. I am used to defending my faith using only the Bible, and used to the fact that many view the bible as violating the commandment to not add or take away from. ( Yes, we believe the Book of Mormon doesn't violate that. I'll come to \"why\" later.)\n \n Briefly, we believe in a far more actual sense than most Christians that we are created in God's image. (And yes, that means we believe differently than the Protestants.) We believe we are His children. \n \n Easyrider, your question is about to be answered. We believe that God organized our spirits from pre-existing \"intelligences.\" The word that is translated in the KJV as \"created\" and \"formed\" is \"baurau.\" (I'm unsure of the spelling.) This can mean \"organized\" with the connotation of pre-existing matter. In some versions of the Bible, it has been translated in that way. Christ was the first and greatest of us to be born from intelligence to spirit, and is the Firstborn of God. He is greater than any of us, and has always been. His intelligence, or consciousness, was never created. His essence is eternal. \n \n We believe that we are in the complete image of God, and are very much the children of God. As such, there is a spark of the divine in all of us. We believe that we are to worship God, but that is not the sole destiny that He has in mind for all of us. We believe that as a Father who loves His children more than anything else, He wants more for us, and has a plan for us to be able to progress to our full potential.\n \n What is that potential as children of God? Romans 8:17 \"And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.\" What is an heir? Like an heir to a kingdom? One who inherits. We are joint-heirs with Christ, what does that mean? A joint-heir is a co-heir, and heir that shares in the inheritance. What did Christ inherit? How will we be \"Glorified together?\"\n \n Speaking of Christ, Philipians 2: 6 says, \"Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:\" This was His inheritance.\n \n Philipians 3: 21, \"Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.\" Christ has a perfect body, the body of a God. An omipotent body.\n \n As to the couplet, \"As man is, God once was; as God is, man may become,\" we believe this to be supported by John 5:19, \"Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.\" The Son took on flesh, lead a mortal life. Then, afterward, as we read in Philipians 3: 21, He received a perfect body, and was raised to a higher state. \n \n Therefore, yes we believe that God also has a body, and that he also followed the pattern of Eternal Progression. We also believe it because he formed us in His own Image. Like I said, we believe that a bit more literally than the Protestants. He is perfect in knowledge and power, and progresses only in kingdoms and dominions. All our glory adds to His.\n \n One final scripture; Matthew 5:48 \"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.\" How is he perfect? He is perfect in love, in knowledge, in power, in form, and in action. He exhorts us to follow Him in that. \n \n Having said the above, I know that many are riled, and consider this the most atrocious, self-elevating blasphemy that they have ever heard. I understand. I was shocked at first, too. It may help to know that we believe that we will ALWAYS be subject to God. According to us, He will ALWAYS be our Father, and ALWAYS be greater than us. Our glory only adds to His, so the greater we become, the more honor and glory to the Most High. It may not help much, but...\n \n It may help more to point out that there are several accepted branches of Christianity that believe a similar thing, except that they believe we are all parts of God Himself, and merge back into Him after death.\n \n We also believe that we can never do this on our own. As many of you are saying to yourselves, \"We could NEVER be worthy of that!\" And we agree. By ourselves we will never measure up. It is only through the grace of God, and the sacrifice that Christ made for all of us that we may be cleansed. \n \n Seriously, the reason the Esdraelon brought this up is that it is the most divergent belief that we have. After polygamy and Eternal Progression, we are fairly standard Christians.\n \n The reason I said that we had strange beliefs, but regular practices is this exact thing: really, what does that change in trying to live as a disciple of Christ? Christ is still our only hope, our only salvation. He is still far beyond us, and more perfect than we could ever hope to be. God is still our Father. We still must live as best we can on this earth. \n \n It changes doctrine, but not practice. Faith is necessary for salvation. According to James 2:18, \"Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.\" What we practice is our faith. \n \n I am not trying to convince anybody that they must believe as I believe. I'm not asking or expecting you to accept it. Don't interpret it to be that way. I am merely stating what we believe, and why we believe it. I know that it is contrary to many of your beliefs, but I ask you to please be respectful in your replies.",

Eternal Progression is a really big discussion, and I'll write on that later tonight if I have time, but my wife had a hard day, so I'm pampering her tonight. You know how it is.\n\n \n Yes, I know how it is. I have been married for 35 years. I have a few questions on 'pampering your wife', but we will get to them later. As you noted in your post below, you have a life outside this forum, well, we all do. You started the thread so don't throw down a challenge if you are not willing to take the time to take it back up. Although you are doing that, you should do it without bemoaning the responses that are forthcoming.\n \n \nEsdraeleon It is very important to know the specific context, because we hold a prophet to speak the words of God only when he is speaking as a prophet; in other words, in a General Conference meeting, Special Assembly, or when he specifies that he has received a revelation.

The principles that are cannon are that Christ and God are our only judges, and that Christ, not Joseph Smith, is our mediator with the Father. \n\n \n\n \n If we are to continue this, we will need to agree on the meaning of 'context'. Context, unfortunately, is many times relative to the person reading the passage or whatever he is reading. Context is very convenient in dodging the essence of a question. 'Context' in scripture is, in my opinion, that accepted by a wide range of different biblical theologians in agreement, similar to the way the books in the bible were studied and deemed 'scriptural'. Although we also have our own view of a passage based upon how the spirit moves us, too often we are moved much by our own prejudices and pre-determined perceptions rather than what the spirit is actually trying to tell us. This is why it is important to have one or more Concordances, such as Strong's, etc, to get a basic understanding of a passage when read for the first time, etc. \n \n One of the basic but most divergent points between Mormonism and Christianity in general is how scripture is approached, defined, interpreted, and used. If this discussion continues, we will get more into this.\n \n \nHere is a doctrinal quote from Joseph Smith\n &#8220;The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it.&#8221; \n \n\n \n The above is a very basic statement that any 'Christian' church would endeavor to put forth publicly, however, when elsewhere in the church doctrine broad, questionable practices and claims arise, it becomes obvious that such are also divergent from Christianity in general. By this I mean not reading into scripture what obviously is not there.\n \n Please, in the future, when you quote something you state pertains to the church, back it up by lising the location where this quote was pulled as I did in my posts. \n \n \nEven the cover of the Book of Mormon states \"Another Testament of Jesus Christ.\" Even everything we do in the temple is centered around Christ. He was the only perfect man, and the only name by which we can be saved.\n \n\n \n Again, it is not what is stated, it is how it is practiced. \n \n More later.",

This approach allows Mormons to ignore key Bible Scriptures which refute Mormon doctrines. Bible verses used to counter Mormon teachings are brushed off in favor of passages from the Book of Mormon and other Mormon scriptures (as well as ongoing revelation that often contradicts previous LDS Church teachings).\n \n It should be noted that the LDS Church has published its own version of the King James Bible, incorporating footnotes explaining what corrections from Joseph Smith's \"inspired version\" of the Bible (a version full of errors and plagiarized material) should be taken into account.\n \n Mormon allegations regarding the Bible and the course of Christianity are refuted by history, archeology, and other sciences, the scriptures of the Mormon church are problematic at every turn. Far from showing so-called 'restored truth,' they are testimonies to the deceptive nature of Mormonism.\n \n In general, Mormons, and I say again, this is not my first ball, will use the Holy Bible to 'defend their faith' as long as it suits them to do so, and as long as they can pull out of 'context' that which suits their purpose. \n \n It is a far different matter to declare 'context' when one is discussing words out of the mouths of claimed prophets, picking an choosing when they are, or not, 'prophets' and arguing context in a scriptural passage. If you are going to quote \"one verse wonders\" to substantiate your faith, be certain that that verse does not diverge from the generally accepted context of the overall passage you pull it from.\n \n Thus when you 'defend your faith using scripture' the above needs to be understood.\n \n And yes, I AM biased.

   "So... I spent more than an hour on a very detailed response. Then somebody tripped over my computer chord, bringing it crashing to the floor, and shutting it off. I had most of it saved, so I'll just post that, and go to bed. If there are parts that don't make sense, or are incomplete, I'll correct them tomorrow.\n \n \nAnother item we need to understand at the start is that Article 8 of the Mormon Articles of Faith (Note 2) says, \"We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it has been translated correctly.\" (Italics mine.) This approach allows Mormons to ignore key Bible Scriptures which refute Mormon doctrines. \n For the record, in such discussions, I never use the Joseph Smith Translation. I use the King James Version. I do this so that it's obvious that I don't use it as an easy out. None of the scriptures I quoted are JST, they are all KJV. Yet the Bible contradicts itself, by telling us in one story of Paul's vision of Christ on the road to Damascus that Paul's companions saw the light, but heard not the voice, yet in the other tell us that Paul's companions heard the voice, but saw not the light. \n \n Yet again when we read \n John 1: 18 No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.\n 1 Jn. 4: 12 No man hath bseen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.\n \n Yet this is contradicted again in the following:\n \n Acts 7:55 But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus estanding on the fright hand of God,\n \n Exodus 33: 11 And the Lord spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend.\n \n Ezekiel 1:28 As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.\n \n Genesis 32:30 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.\n \n These and many other such examples are used by anti-Christians to discredit the Bible.\n \n With so many differing translations, (List of English Bible translations - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia) it is impossible to believe them all of equal truth, especially when they contradict each other on occasion. I once had a Jehova's Witness tell me that all versions of the Bible are equally correct. Using his version, which is very different that the one the King James Version that I use, all of his arguments made sense. Using the KJV, they didn't. To me there seems some discrepancy then, in the assumption that every translation is equally correct. Also, I am fluent in Italian, and have read the Diodati version of the bible extensively, and large portions of a couple of others. I have read the New World translation in English. There are several differences in the wording, that significantly add to or change the meaning. For instance, the KJV notes that \"The Lord sent an evil spirit between Saul and David,\" and then Saul threw a javelin at David in an attempt to kill him. Why would the Lord do that? In the Diodati, it just states, \"Venni un spirito malvaggio,\" or \"There came an evil spirit between Sual and David.\"\n \n We do believe the Bible to be the word of God. \"as far as it is translated correctly,\" just means that we do not believe every translation is correct. Given your clear opposition to the \"Joseph Smith Translation,\" it seems that you agree with us. You believe the Bible to be the word of God, \"As far as it is translated correctly.\"\n \n Incidentally, Joseph Smith (who was fully fluent in more than six languages at the time of his death; learning them in the pursuit of reading as many different translations of the Bible as he could,) said that after the JST, the German Bible was more correct a translation than any other.\n \n \nIn general, Mormons, and I say again, this is not my first ball, will use the Holy Bible to 'defend their faith' as long as it suits them to do so, and as long as they can pull out of 'context' that which suits their purpose.\n \"as long as it suits them\". Nice wording there. Yes, it \"suits\" me whenever I speak about religion. I submit that it suits you too. Please start. And about \"out of context\"...\n \nIf we are to continue this, we will need to agree on the meaning of 'context'. Context, unfortunately, is many times relative to the person reading the passage or whatever he is reading. Context is very convenient in dodging the essence of a question. 'Context' in scripture is, in my opinion, that accepted by a wide range of different biblical theologians in agreement, similar to the way the books in the bible were studied and deemed 'scriptural'. Although we also have our own view of a passage based upon how the spirit moves us, too often we are moved much by our own prejudices and pre-determined perceptions rather than what the spirit is actually trying to tell us. \n I agree fully with the part in the italics that I added. As to the rest, I propose that we use the internationally accepted definition of the word \"context.\" (Context - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary) Namely, \"the parts of a discourse that surround a word or passage and can throw light on its meaning.\" I understand this to mean that a thing is out of context if removing it from that context changes its meaning. I am interested to know how you feel that the scriptures I quoted are \"out of context.\" In your interpretation, how is the meaning changed? In what way would the meaning be affected when placed back in context?\n \n If I am using these or any other scriptures that I have quoted out of context, then please tell me how, in specifics. This is all my own research, so there may be mistakes. In these instances I am confidant that I have not made any mistakes, but I would like to better understand your opinion. If it will help, I can at least give backgrounds for each verse that I cite. I just assumed that you had a Bible, and would look up the context.\n \n In case anybody doesn't have a copy of the Bible; and would like to read the context for themselves, here is a link to a copy of the scriptures, including the King James Version of the Bible. (This is the official site of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The Joseph Smith Translation is contained in the footnotes only, but is there in case you are interested to know what it contains.) Scriptures\n \n \n \nBible verses used to counter Mormon teachings are brushed off in favor of passages from the Book of Mormon and other Mormon scriptures (as well as ongoing revelation that often contradicts previous LDS Church teachings).\n If we felt that the Bible and Book of Mormon contradicted each other, then we would not believe in both. I certainly do not \"brush off\" Biblical verses in favor of Book of Mormon text. Some LDS who are less familiar with the Bible than the Book of Mormon may do that, but I am actually more familiar with the Bible. \n \n \nIt should be noted that the LDS Church has published its own version of the King James Bible, incorporating footnotes explaining what corrections from Joseph Smith's \"inspired version\" of the Bible (a version full of errors and plagiarized material) should be taken into account\n. Yes, we do have an LDS-specific translation, and are hardly the only religion to have a self-sponsored translation, but ...Plagiarized? Where exactly? And as far as errors, I will consider that a matter of opinion until a third-party linguistics expert is able to prove to me the errors. I am fairly proficient in Latin (after learning Italian, it was a short jump.) and my father is fluent in Hebrew, having worked with the government in Jerusalem. A close friend of mine in Italy was Greek. They all say that the majority of the JST (Joseph Smith Translation) alterations are readily justifiable. Admittedly, I have no source for the Aramaic texts, and none of them hold degrees in linguistics. Regardless, I have yet to be convinced that the JST is so flawed.\n \n \nMormon allegations regarding the Bible and the course of Christianity are refuted by history, archeology, and other sciences, the scriptures of the Mormon church are problematic at every turn. Far from showing so-called 'restored truth,' they are testimonies to the deceptive nature of Mormonism.\n Esdraelon, I see a pattern in your posts of many claims that remain unsubstantiated. Please include specifics; substantiate them. I am rather unsure what you are referring too. \"Mormon allegations regarding the Bible and the course of Christianity are refuted by history, archeology, and other sciences, the scriptures of the Mormon church are problematic at every turn.\" Examples? I was impressed with one of your first quotes, where you cited several excellent sources for the full understanding of our doctrines. I am disappointed with the quality of every one of your posts since. It seems to me now that you are not as informed of our doctrines as I previously supposed, but simply own one of the hundreds of Anti-Mormon books out there, and pulled a few citations from that, and nothing more. I sincerely hope that I am wrong, but that is how your lasts posts have come across.\n \n \nThe above is a very basic statement that any 'Christian' church would endeavor to put forth publicly, however, when elsewhere in the church doctrine broad, questionable practices and claims arise, it becomes obvious that such are also divergent from Christianity in general. By this I mean not reading into scripture what obviously is not there.\n \n Please, in the future, when you quote something you state pertains to the church, back it up by lising the location where this quote was pulled as I did in my posts.\n I find it kind of ironic that these posts were next to each other. Here I find another unsubstantiated claim. \"...elsewhere in the church doctrine broad, questionable practices and claims arise...\" To what practices and claims are you referring? Where have you \"listed the location\" for this claim? It is not a quote, but it is still unbacked. How can I respond to something so very vague and general? \"Obviously not there.\" How can you believe that using such phrases are conducive to a rational and level discussion? Esdraelon, if you do not back your claims, or at least make them in specifics and not generalizations, I will have no reason to respond to you, because you give me no points to respond to.\n \n As to the location for that Joseph Smith quote, it is \"Aaronic Priesthood Manual 3\" in lesson 7. It is also listed in our \"Sunday School Manual\", our \"Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith\" manual and many others. Sorry that I missed one, I'll try not to do it again. And yes, any Christian church would espouse such a basic doctrine. Such basic doctrines make up over half of the book of mormon, which is why I don't take your dismissal of the book of mormon seriously. You haven't convinced me that you know what's in it. Here is a link to the Book of Mormon: Book of Mormon Please read at least some of it. I would like to know specifically what in this book you believe is so heretical. \n \n \nIt is a far different matter to declare 'context' when one is discussing words out of the mouths of claimed prophets, picking an choosing when they are, or not, 'prophets' and arguing context in a scriptural passage. If you are going to quote \"one verse wonders\" to substantiate your faith, be certain that that verse does not diverge from the generally accepted context of the overall passage you pull it from.\n I don't feel that it is out of context. As for \"prophet or not,\" to believe that a person (or a prophet,) is infallible is to believe they cannot err. To never err, one must be perfect. We believe that only Christ was perfect. Therefore, only when speaking the Word of God, (Whose Word is perfect,) will he be infallible. It seems logical to me. I am interested in your opinion on the matter. btw, I like your phrase, \"one verse wonders.\" They are little wonders, aren't they? ;) Just because they are short doesn't make them untrue. These being scriptures that I use in such discussion often, I have checked the context, and I can't see any meaning that changes when read as part of the chapter as a whole. I try to always keep context in mind.\n Is this an expression of frustration that there are scriptures in the Bible which seem to agree with our interpretation? Please tell me that this is not the case; previous to the last few posts, I felt that you had been moderately respectful and rational in our exchange, I would be very disappointed if you continue making unsubstantiated and vague explanations which essentially just express that you disagree with me.\n \n \nAnd yes, I AM biased. \n I have noticed. This is becoming more apparent with every post. I think there is not a poster on this thread, (myself included) who can say that were aren't biased. That does not mean that we cannot have a civil, balanced, and respectful discussion. Let's not devolve to vague accusations and generalizations. \n \n And of course, if any of us hold an opinion, we are sure that we hold it \nWith very, very, very, good reason.\n \n \n I tire of responding to unbased posts. I urge all to please post responsibly. Simply posting your opinion does not make for a good discussion. Posting it once is fine. After that it becomes redundant. It lends to a \"DOES NOT!\"/\"DOES TOO!\" argument that does no good to anybody.",

I am interested in your opinion on the matter. btw, I like your phrase, \"one verse wonders.\" They are little wonders, aren't they? ;) Just because they are short doesn't make them untrue. These being scriptures that I use in such discussion often, I have checked the context, and I can't see any meaning that changes when read as part of the chapter as a whole. I try to always keep context in mind.\n Is this an expression of frustration that there are scriptures in the Bible which seem to agree with our interpretation? Please tell me that this is not the case; previous to the last few posts, I felt that you had been moderately respectful and rational in our exchange, I would be very disappointed if you continue making unsubstantiated and vague explanations which essentially just express that you disagree with me.\n \n\n \n Trust me, and again those were generalizations that all contain a huge amount of fact. We'll take them a few at a time. Have no fear; they will be substantiated.\n \n \nI have noticed. This is becoming more apparent with every post. I think there is not a poster on this thread, (myself included) who can say that were aren't biased. That does not mean that we cannot have a civil, balanced, and respectful discussion. Let's not devolve to vague accusations and generalizations. \n\n \n Looks like you're making a complete response on 'accusations and generalizations.' We'll move it forward.\n \n \nAnd of course, if any of us hold an opinion, we are sure that we hold it \n\n \n Duh? I guess I should memorize this one.\n \n \nI tire of responding to unbased posts. I urge all to please post responsibly. Simply posting your opinion does not make for a good discussion. Posting it once is fine. After that it becomes redundant. It lends to a \"DOES NOT!\"/\"DOES TOO!\" argument that does no good to anybody. \n \n\n \n Noted.",

   "\n \n Easyrider, your question is about to be answered. We believe that God organized our spirits from pre-existing \"intelligences.\" The word that is translated in the KJV as \"created\" and \"formed\" is \"baurau.\" (I'm unsure of the spelling.) This can mean \"organized\" with the connotation of pre-existing matter. In some versions of the Bible, it has been translated in that way. Christ was the first and greatest of us to be born from intelligence to spirit, and is the Firstborn of God. He is greater than any of us, and has always been. His intelligence, or consciousness, was never created. His essence is eternal.\n\n \n Thanks for the response from your understanding of Mormonism. I'm curious about the part in bold - where you say the spirit of Christ was born from intelligence. So I have a few questions:\n \n 1. When did this birth from intelligence to spirit occur? Are you talking about way before Jesus' incarnation on earth? \n \n 2. And what existed first, the intelligence from which the Spirit of Christ was supposedly born, or Christ from which intelligence originated?\n \n 3. Was Jesus always God, or did he become God at some point? Please be specific.\n \n Thank you.",

   "romebigred: Since you asked for some specifics, please explain the following:\n \n DNA tests contradict Mormon scripture. The church says the studies are being twisted to attack its beliefs.\n \n For Mormons, the lack of discernible Hebrew blood in Native Americans is no minor collision between faith and science. It burrows into the historical foundations of the Book of Mormon, a 175-year-old transcription that the church regards as literal and without error.\n \n For those outside the faith, the depth of the church's dilemma can be explained this way: Imagine if DNA evidence revealed that the Pilgrims didn't sail from Europe to escape religious persecution but rather were part of a migration from Iceland -- and that U.S. history books were wrong.\n \n Critics want the church to admit its mistake and apologize to millions of Native Americans it converted. Church leaders have shown no inclination to do so. Indeed, they have dismissed as heresy any suggestion that Native American genetics undermine the Mormon creed.\n \n Yet at the same time, the church has subtly promoted a fresh interpretation of the Book of Mormon intended to reconcile the DNA findings with the scriptures. This analysis is radically at odds with long-standing Mormon teachings.\n \n Some longtime observers believe that ultimately, the vast majority of Mormons will disregard the genetic research as an unworthy distraction from their faith.

   "FairMormon: I have taken only a quick look. It is not a well-known site among mainstream LDS, as you seem to think; nor it it sponsored by our church. Many of our members make such sites independently, and no, I have not read them all. However, given that it cites such books as Mormonism Unvailed (Eber Dudley Howe, Painesville, Ohio: Telegraph Press, 1834) as source [3] on the like you posted, along with many other such sources, I think it apparent that Fair Mormon is not a definitive source. I have read most of this book, and found it no surprise that it is largely discounted as sensationalistic rather than objective, even by many non-LDS. I am unfamiliar with the story on this link, and therefore it would be irresponsible of me to reply until I verified it and researched it. There are many claims of Joseph Smith being a \"treasure hunter,\" but on closer inspection, I have found that most of them are stories that have evolved out of the LDS-accepted doctrine of Joseph's receiving the golden tablets. By evolved, I mean changed from mouth to mouth until they do not resemble the original. I will look into this one, and find out.\n \n \nAre they 'contradictions' or apparent contradictions that can be reasonably explained? \nThis is essentially the question I was asking you I posted them. You decide. Agree or disagree, I hope that you may begin to at least understand why we believe that some passages are incorrectly translated, even if you believe that it is not the case.\n \n \nBy and large, responses will use words out of the mouth of your own doctrine, so if you are 'disrespected' by facts, that's your problem.\n \n Actually, I have not felt disrespected by any of the substantiated claims you have made. It is the ones that are your words alone that make me feel disrespected. Such unsubstantiated claims as: \nFar from showing so-called 'restored truth,' they are testimonies to the deceptive nature of Mormonism.\n are disrespectful. I have not found it to be the case that \"by and large\" you use the words of our own doctrine. As I find it, only one of your posts did, in fact, use the words of our doctrine. I would welcome such a change.\n \nAgain, the 'generalizations' will be backed up when we are discussing specifics which we will be discussing\n Esdraelon, you keep saying, \"but we will get to that later.\" If you are not planning on talking about it now, then please refrain from making the claim now.

Otherwise it must be assumed that these claims are nothing more than opinion. \n \n \nAs should be obvious I was not using this post to give examples.\n If you are not to give an example, a specific, or make a substantiated point, then why post?

   "questionable practices and claims arise, it becomes obvious that such are also divergent from Christianity in general. \n \n 1. If Gods are individuals who have passed through mortality and have progressed to Godhood, how has one person of the Trinity (the Holy Spirit) attained Godhood without getting a body? (See Acts 5:3,4) Some Mormons say ya'll believe this Trinity? Is this true?\n \n 2. If Gods are individuals who have passed through an earth life to attain Godhood, how is it that one person of the Trinity (Jesus Christ) was God before He received a body or passed through earth life? (Matt. 1:23 and Hebrews 10:5) Easy asked something very similar.\n \n 3. If the Book of Mormon really contains the fullness of the Gospel, why does it not teach the doctrine of &#8220;eternal progression&#8221;? (See D&C 20:8,9) \n \n 4. (As noted previously) Joseph Smith declared, \"God himself was once as we are now, and is an exalted man, and sits enthroned in yonder heavens!\" (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, pg. 345).\n \n 5.Mormon Apostle John Widtsoe stated, \"God and man are of the same race, differing only in their degrees of advancement\" (Gospel Through the Ages, pg. 107). This concurs with Mormon Apostle Parley P. Pratt's comment which states, \"God, angels, and men are all of the same species, one race, one great family...\" (Key to the Science of Theology, 1978 ed., pg. 21).\n \n \n reading into scripture what obviously is not there.\n \n BoM: 1) \". . . for we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do.\" (Book of Mormon / 2 Nephi 25:23) (Italics mine)\n \n Holy Bible: For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast. (Ephesians 2: 8,9 - true faith will have works (cf. James 2:17) but faith alone saves.)\n \n The Book of Mormon above changes the principal into something different. The principal is not the same. The Bible tells us that God's salvation is a gift but the book of Mormon tells us that in order to get salvation we have to do something, (work for it or earn it).\n \n BoM: 2) . . I remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world.\" (Book of Mormon / Alma 36:17) (Italics mine)\n \n Notice that it says \"a Son of God.\" Jesus is the Son of God, not just a Son of God. \n 1 John 4:15 tells us, \"Whosoever shalt confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.\n \n 3) \"And behold, he shall be born of Mary, at Jerusalem which is the land of our forefathers, . . .\" (Alma 7: 10)\n \n But Jesus was born in \"Bethlehem of Judaea\" (Matthew 2:1 - cf. Luke 2:4 & Micah 5:2). Jerusalem is a distinct city and not \"the land of our forefathers.\" Furthermore, Jesus was born in Bethlehem which is a distinct town outside of Jerusalem (Emmaus and Bethany are closer to Jerusalem. He was not born in the district of Jerusalem but in the district of Judaea.\n \n \n This approach allows Mormons to ignore key Bible Scriptures which refute Mormon doctrines \n \n B) Joseph Smith, founder of the Mormon faith, certainly didn't take portions of the Book of Mormon very seriously. He contradicted them & changed the wording of parts of the 1830 edition (that was supposedly translated \"by the gift and power of God.\")\n \n 1) \"For I know that God is not a partial God, neither a changeable being; but he is unchangeable from all eternity to all eternity.\" (Moroni 8:18)\n \n About 14 years after the 1830 Book of Mormon came out, Joseph Smith refuted his own book! In a major sermon (see Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, compiled by Joseph Fielding Smith, p. 345) we read:\n \n \"We have imagined and supposed that God was God from all eternity. I will refute that idea, and take away the veil . ... ..\n \n 2) \"Behold, David and Solomon truly had many wives and concubines, which thing was abominable before me, saith the Lord.\" (Jacob 2:24)\n \n Perhaps Joseph had forgotten all about Jacob 2:24 when he had this 'revelation' recorded in Doctrine & Covenants 132: 1:\n \n \". . . I, the Lord, justified my servants Abraham, Issac, and Jacob, as also Moses, David and Solomon, my servants, as touching the principle and doctrine of their having many wives and concubines- \"\n \n 3) \". . . And now, behold, this is the doctrine of Christ, and the only and true doctrine of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, which is one God, without end. Amen.\" (2 Nephi 31:21)\n \n 'I will preach on the plurality of Gods. I have selected this text for that express purpose. I wish to declare I have always and in all congregations when I have preached on the subject of the Deity, it has been the plurality of Gods. ... I have always declared God to be a distinct personage, Jesus Christ a separate and distinct personage from God the Father, and that the Holy Ghost was a distinct personage and a Spirit: and, these three constitute three distinct personages and three Gods. ... we have three Gods anyhow, and they are plural; and who can contradict it?\" (as recorded in Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, p. 370)\n \n Who can contradict it? Well, consider 2 Nephi 31:21, Alma 11: 44, Mosiah 15:1-5, and \"The Testimony of Three Witnesses\" at the front of the B.O.M. (not to mention D. & C. 20:28)!\n \n 4) \"And Zeezrom said unto him: Thou sayest there is a true and living God? And Amulek said: Yea, there is a true and living God. Now Zeezrom said: Is there more than one God? And he answered, No. Now Zeezrom said unto him again; How knowest thou these things? And he said: An angel hath made them known unto me. (Alma 11: 26-3 1 )\n \n From one \"true and living God\" here, Joseph Smith ended up promoting at least three for this earth (see No. 3 above).\n \n 5)In a letter from Joseph Anderson on July 29, 1974 (then managing director of the L.D.S. Historical Department), we read:\n \n \"For example, Joseph Smith made many corrections in the 1837 and the 1840 editions of the Book of Mormon. ... \"\n \n C) The Mormon Church was not content to let the revised Book of Mormon alone, but recently came out with yet another revision, changing portions of the book back to an 1830 wording, but then taking some parts that were faithful to the 1830 edition and changing them. For instance, the pre-1981 modern edition vs. the 1981 modern edition includes the following changes (newest will be listed second):\n \n \"plainess of the gospel\" (I Ne. 13:24)\n VS.\n \"fulness of the gospel.\"\n \n \"white and delightsome people\" (2 Ne. 30:6)\n VS.\n \"pure and delightsome people\"\n \n Why the change from white (skin-color) to pure (moral quality)? Probably this tampering with the text (which was faithful to the 1830 ed.) was an effort to remove a source of irritation for dark-skinned people.\n \n Mormon allegations regarding the Bible and the course of Christianity are refuted by history, archeology, and other sciences, the scriptures of the Mormon church are problematic at every turn.\n \n For all the talk of archeological finds which \"support\" the Book of Mormon, the fact remains that not even one Book of Mormon city located in this hemisphere has ever been found (proven to have existed)!! Even the knowledgeable Thomas Stuart Ferguson admitted \" ' .. there is no Book-of-Mormon geography. \" (Written Symposium on Book-of-Mormon Geography, 3/12/75).\n \n The Bible, however, has a wealth of solid archeological evidence behind it (such as identified cities). We are asked to believe that the Jewish 'Lamanites' of the Book of Mormon are the forefathers of the present-day Indians. Indians are of the Mongoloid race however, and not the Caucasoid (which the Jews belong to).\n \n One major claim made for the Book of Mormon is that it contains the fullness of the everlasting gospel (see Doctrine & Covenants 27:5 and 135:3). According to Doctrines of Salvation, volume 1, p. 160, we read: \"By fullness of the gospel is meant all the ordinances and principles that pertain to the exaltation in the celestial kingdom . . . \" Celestial marriage is an essential requirement to gain this exaltation (that is, Godhood), but where does the Book of Mormon mention celestial marriage (or for that matter, men can become Gods, God was once a man, baptism for the dead, the Word of Wisdom, a heavenly Mother, etc.)?\n \n I will have the rest shortly.",

   "Edraelon, your last post was much more what I was looking for. Thank you. \n \n Easyrider first:\n First of all, I want to thank you for you direct manner, and for asking such excellent questions. These do have a big impact on the way that we view the nature of the Godhead, or Trinity; and are therefore important.\n \n To understand our beliefs here, we must begin with the fact that LDS are non-trinitarian. We believe in God, the Father, in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost, but we believe them to all be separate beings. We are a minority among Christians, in that; but there are several that agree with us, such as Pentecostals. (Nontrinitarianism - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia) There are many scriptures that can be interpreted to give strong backing to the concept of the Trinity. Non-Trinitarians interpret them differently. \n (This rest is speaking only for LDS, not other Non-Trinitarians.) For example, Christ says that He is one with the Father in John 17:21 \"That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us.\" John 17 He is praying for the Apostles and their converts. We believe that He is saying that He wants them to be one with Him and each other, etc, in the same way that He is one with the Father. We believe that this means in purpose, action, and thought. As we understand it, if this were not so, then He would be asking the Father to invite the Apostles and their converts to merge into one being and merge with Him and the Father; an invitation to the Godhead. (As context, Christ is kneeling with His Apostles, offering the Intercessory Prayer, and is praying specifically for \"the men which thou gavest me out of the world:\"--verse 6--We believe that He is praying for His Apostles and all of their converts: \"also which shall believe on me through their word\") Having said this, I can definitely see how you it can be interpreted differently. I think that honestly, to a third party, the scriptures that are cited in support of one or the other are equally convincing, which mean it comes down to personal conscience, hearing the Holy Spirit, and personal faith.\n \n Therefore, if God created all things, (except that we believe that Christ created the earth at His commandment,) and God is not the same thing as Christ, then it makes sense God created Christs' spirit. \n \n \n1. When did this birth from intelligence to spirit occur? Are you talking about way before Jesus' incarnation on earth?\n \n \n Yes. It happened before your or my creation, before the creation of the world, but there is a caveat to that... We believe that to God, time is non-linear. We believe that time is measured only unto man, and that to God, all times are the present. This makes it a tricky question... However, in time as we understand it, Christ was first. (The Pearl of Great Price Student Manual, Religion 327 \u00a9 2000 by Intellectual Reserve, Inc.)\n \n \n2. And what existed first, the intelligence from which the Spirit of Christ was supposedly born, or Christ from which intelligence originated?\n They are the same. \"intelligence\" as used in LDS spiritual context, is not \"smarts,\" it is essence of being, personality, and self. It is eternal, and therefore, Christ, as a being, as a personality, as an entity, has always existed. It has many meanings, but in this context, these are the meanings. \n \n \n3. Was Jesus always God, or did he become God at some point? Please be specific.\n Excellent questions! I have actually never been asked this one before, which, for the number of these discussions that I have been involved in, is saying something. Our doctrine does not specify whether He was God as an \"intelligence\", but it never intimates that He wasn't. As a spirit, in His earthly life, and afterward, Christ is most definitely God.\n \n Truth be told, these is what we LDS lovingly refer to as \"space doctrine.\" That is; it is information that does not affect daily practice of our religion. It is not a doctrine that you will hear every Sunday in church. It is still important, but not as important as the concept of faith on Jesus Christ as our Savior, God and friend, or of God as our Father, all of which affect our practice daily.\n \n I know that some portions of this, or all of this, are seen as heretical by many or perhaps all who believe in the Trinity. What I state here is not intended to convince you to change your beliefs, but merely stating what ours are. Regardless, thank you for your patience and for the respectful way that you asked those questions.",

   "Esdraelon, You have given me excellent, substantiated and specific posts to reply to, thank you. This will have to be my last post today, I'm neglecting my classwork. I ask that you withhold any further claims until I have time to respond to what you have already posted. I will cover the claimed contradictions in my next post.\n \n Briefly, as far as Historical claims, I think that this argument is dead in the water. We are talking of a matter of personal faith, and faith often seems to stand at odds with material evidence. One can argue that the evidences support us as well as counter us, like so:\n \n Historically: \n When the Book of Mormon was published, many laughed at it from a historical aspect. They claimed that there were no civilizations in the ancient American continents that were so advanced and developed by 600 BC. Since then, ruins have been discovered that pre-date the previously known ones ones by several thousand years, with conclusive evidence of expansive trade. This gives us a possibility of a civilization as developed and as ancient as the Book of Mormon says. [url=http://bruceowen.com/worldprehist/3250s17.htm[/url] The Olmecs were up and at 'em even before 600 BC.\n \n Likewise with cement. It was claimed that there was no cement in the ancient American continents. The Book of Mormon says there was. Ancient cement has since been discovered. (David S. Hyman, A Study of the Calcareous Cements in Prehispanic Mesoamerican Building Construction [Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University, 1970], pp. ii, 6-7)\n \n Ditto horses in the Book of Mormon. It was claimed there were no horses in pre-Columbian Americas: Clayton E. Ray, \"Pre-Columbian Horses from Yucatan,\" Journal of Mammalology 38 (1957): 278 \n and\n Carl Chapman, \"Horse Bones in an Ancient Indian Mound,\" Missouri Archaeologist 7, no. 1 (April 1941): 3-8.\n \n And science:\n We follow a health code that we call the Word of Wisdom. Declared in 1833, it requires us to not drink alcohol, tea, or coffee. Tobacco was also prohibited in all forms except as a medical wrap. In the time it was released, this was laughable. Smoking was thought to aid digestion. Nearly a hundred years later, science caught up with this teaching. (Greaves, Lorraine (2002) High Culture: Reflections on Addiction and Modernity. edited by Anna Alexander and Mark S. Roberts. State University of New York Pres) \n \n (FARMS is an organization interested in proving the historical evidences of the Book of Mormon, (http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/) and is composed of members of the LDS church. They have found many secularly accepted archeological links that they insist support the Book of Mormon. Feel free to browse for yourself. NOTE: the results of FARMS do not represent the views of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.)\n \n All I'm saying is that such arguments bother me. They go back and forth and back and forth with proof upon proof. Sometimes one side (LDS, or non-LDS) will \"prove\" something, then a few years later, that \"proof\" is discredited. (Once again, LDS and non-LDS alike.)\n \n As to the DNA, I will not pretend that there is a specific empirical rebuttal for that. (although I have not been able to find the text of that study to be able to verify that it is as conclusive as claimed. I would appreciate any help in finding it.) Just as science \"proved\" that smoking aided digestion, (see above citation,) and turned out to be in error, as well as the claim of the absence of cement, and the horse, I submit that this may prove that way as well. Science also \"proved\" cold fusion. This is not the first time that we have claimed something that seemed to fly in the face of evidence. We are not afraid to do so, and as the posts above show. Regardless, for me the empirical evidence for LDS is just as strong for it as it is against. We have already been proven right in some instances. If our belief were founded on one DNA study, and not on Christ, we may have been shaken; yet our membership hasn't even dipped in the light of this study. As it is, a DNA study cannot controvert for me the witness of the Holy Ghost. Scientific theories come and go, but a witness of the Holy Ghost is constant.\n \n Perhaps we are, as you say, selective in the evidences that we accept. We prefer the evidences we feel in our hearts from (as we believe) the Holy Ghost. To some degree, aren't we all that way, as believers?\n \n Many Christians feel that evolution contradicts Adam and Eve, yet the seeming evidence for evolution continues to mount. \n \n Many Christians believe the history of the earth (or mankind in some beliefs,) is seven thousand years from start to finish, yet archeologists continue to disagree.\n \n Dinosaurs were also thought to eliminate the \"Garden of Eden,\" and the age of the earth. \n \n Consider, if you will, how crazy it must have sounded to claim that a man had risen from the dead? Science cannot support that.\n \n Ask any avid atheist to tell you how he feels Christians deny science and history. He will have an arsenal. How is this different?\n \n Personally, I am unsure as to why so many are so very eager to prove us right or wrong. We are less than 0.5% of the world's population. Many of the rest of the population does not accept Christ. There is war, hatred, and need nearly everywhere; and so many people have nothing better to do than to tear apart somebody's religion, or to prove something that can only truly be known as a matter of faith, not of tangible evidences. (in my mind, FARMS is guilty of this too...) \n \n I weary of your mentality, which seems to me to be that this is a fight, to be won or lost. I am not interested in attack or defense. Admittedly, I created this thread on a \"debate\" forum, and you have every right to post so very aggressively. However, I meant this more as an explanation of our actual beliefs, because I found them misrepresented in such threads as this one: http://www.4forums.com/political/religion-debates/13865-did-god-have-sex-mary.html I meant merely to set forth what we believe in question and answer to posts like Easy's. Obviously, my beliefs are not acceptable to all, and heretical to many. Likewise many of your beliefs in my eyes. I think we all knew this to begin with. You have said this is not your first such discussion, and if that is true, then surely you have found what I did; that such discussions often become heated, and leave each side exhausted, angry and frustrated, but not convinced. I am willing to respond to your myriad of posts and claims, but keep in mind that I am not interested in converting, but in eliminating ignorance. Converting or convincing is not my job, it is the job of the Holy Ghost. Faith is a personal connection to and belief in God, and not the result of debate. I have never seen much of a point in what we LDS call \"bashing\", or religious \"proof\" debates. \n \n Anyhow, I find the historical and scientific evidences interesting, but do not base my faith on them. \n \n See you tomorrow.",

I will cover the claimed contradictions in my next post.\n\n \n That is fine, in the meantime, I will cover what you have just posted.\n \n \nBriefly, as far as Historical claims, I think that this argument is dead in the water. We are talking of a matter of personal faith, and faith often seems to stand at odds with material evidence. One can argue that the evidences support us as well as counter us, like so:\n \n Historically: \n When the Book of Mormon was published, many laughed at it from a historical aspect. They claimed that there were no civilizations in the ancient American continents that were so advanced and developed by 600 BC. Since then, ruins have been discovered that pre-date the previously known ones ones by several thousand years, with conclusive evidence of expansive trade. This gives us a possibility of a civilization as developed and as ancient as the Book of Mormon says. [url=http://bruceowen.com/worldprehist/3250s17.htm[/url] The Olmecs were up and at 'em even before 600 BC.\n \n Likewise with cement. It was claimed that there was no cement in the ancient American continents. The Book of Mormon says there was. Ancient cement has since been discovered. (David S. Hyman, A Study of the Calcareous Cements in Prehispanic Mesoamerican Building Construction [Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University, 1970], pp. ii, 6-7)\n \n Ditto horses in the Book of Mormon. It was claimed there were no horses in pre-Columbian Americas: Clayton E. Ray, \"Pre-Columbian Horses from Yucatan,\" Journal of Mammalology 38 (1957): 278 \n and\n Carl Chapman, \"Horse Bones in an Ancient Indian Mound,\" Missouri Archaeologist 7, no. 1 (April 1941): 3-8.\n\n \n This is from Religious Tolerance .org, certainly not a biased website:\n The Book of Mormon describes migrations of people from the Middle East to Central America, and further describes some features of their civilizations in the New World. If the Book is accurate, archaeologists would expect to find numerous pieces of hard evidence in Central America that confirm the presence of these societies: metal objects; writing in Hebrew and Egyptian, remains of old-world plants, animals from Palestine, etc. Some hard evidence has been found in the past. However, they have all been subsequently shown to be pious forgeries. To date, no actual evidence to confirm the Book of Mormon has been found, although many LDS believers have faith that it will be uncovered in the future. A popular saying in the field of archaeology is that no evidence of existence is not evidence of non-existence.\n \n The Book of Mormon describes three migrations of people from the Middle East to America. 1 The first occurred circa 2247 BCE, at approximately the time of the Tower of Babel as described in Genesis 11:1-10. 2 At that time, God \"confused the language of all the [peoples of the] earth; and from there the Lord scattered them abroad over the face of all the earth.\" [RSV] \"All the earth\" would presumably include the Americas. These people, the Jaredites, eventually died out circa 600 BCE with a massive battle at Hill Comorah in what is now upper New York State.\n \n The second and third migrations occurred circa 600 BCE, between the times of the Assyrian and Babylonian victories over the Israelites. The immigrants:\n \n -\"established huge civilizations that stretched from sea to sea,\n -wrote extensively using Hebrew and Egyptian, \n -domesticated horses and cattle, \n -cultivated many Old World plants,\n -traveled in chariots, and \n -smelted many metals, including iron and steel.\" 1\n \n The Book of Mormon also discusses:\n -Gold and silver coins used by the Nephites. Their monetary system was based on the value of barley. \n -Domesticated species of animals: cattle, oxen, sheep, swine and goats. 5 -Fighting with bows, arrows, and metal shields. \n -Temples, synagogues and sanctuaries for worship. \n \n One group, the Nephites, kept the Law of Moses. The other group, the Lamanites abandoned the beliefs of the Israelites. Because of their unbelief and idolatry, the \"Lord God did cause a skin of blackness to come upon them.\" (2 Nephi 5:21). A major battle occurred between the Nephites and Lamanites at the Hill Comorah in 385 CE. \n \n If the Book of Mormon is true, then there would be certain logical consequences:\n -Studies of the blood types, facial shape, and genetic makeup of modern-day Native Americans would show that they were related closely to the ancient Israelites, and thus to present-day Jews. Some DNA evidence among a minority of Native Americans has been found that shows the likelihood of a migration of individuals from Europe and Asia Minor to America. However, their arrival date in the new world was about 10,000 BCE or earlier. Thus, the migration is unrelated to activities in the Book of Mormon. No evidence has been found for a migration during the time span that the Book discusses. 18\n bullet Archaeologists could go to the remains of ancient Native American towns, excavate down to the levels that were active between 600 BCE and 385 CE, and uncover evidences of Nephite or Lamanite writings, domesticated horses, old world plants, chariots, inscriptions, metal objects, etc.\n -Excavating the Hill Comorah should reveal countless artifacts left by the hundreds of thousands of soldiers who died there in two major battles.\n -One would expect names from the Book of Mormon to be present in inscriptions left by the Nephites or Lamanites. Thomas Ferguson wrote:\n \n \"The important thing now is to continue the digging at an accelerated pace in order to find more inscriptions dating to Book-of-Mormon times. Eventually we should find decipherable inscriptions ... referring to some unique person, place or event in the Book of Mormon.\" 16 \n \n Quite a few pious forgeries have been planted and \"discovered.\" However, no convincing evidence was ever found that has been accepted by non-Mormon archaeologists. Religious Tolerance.org\n \n I believe you oversimplify and make a grasp when you infuse the Olmecs into the situation. Is it your intention to suggest that the Olmecs qualify as an explanation for the above?\n \n \nAnd science:\n We follow a health code that we call the Word of Wisdom. Declared in 1833, it requires us to not drink alcohol, tea, or coffee. Tobacco was also prohibited in all forms except as a medical wrap. In the time it was released, this was laughable. Smoking was thought to aid digestion. Nearly a hundred years later, science caught up with this teaching. (Greaves, Lorraine (2002) High Culture: Reflections on Addiction and Modernity. edited by Anna Alexander and Mark S. Roberts. State University of New York Pres) \n\n \n I follow a health code.......\n \n \n(FARMS is an organization interested in proving the historical evidences of the Book of Mormon, (http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/) and is composed of members of the LDS church. They have found many secularly accepted archeological links that they insist support the Book of Mormon. Feel free to browse for yourself. NOTE: the results of FARMS do not represent the views of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.)\n\n \n How do Mormons explain no archeological evidence of the supposed big battle in New York?\n \n \nAll I'm saying is that such arguments bother me. They go back and forth and back and forth with proof upon proof. Sometimes one side (LDS, or non-LDS) will \"prove\" something, then a few years later, that \"proof\" is discredited. (Once again, LDS and non-LDS alike.)\n \n\n \n I do not see this happening, rather, all I see is still no archaeological evidence. \n \n \nAs to the DNA, I will not pretend that there is a specific empirical rebuttal for that. (although I have not been able to find the text of that study to be able to verify that it is as conclusive as claimed. I would appreciate any help in finding it.) Just as science \"proved\" that smoking aided digestion, (see above citation,) and turned out to be in error, as well as the claim of the absence of cement, and the horse, I submit that this may prove that way as well. Science also \"proved\" cold fusion. This is not the first time that we have claimed something that seemed to fly in the face of evidence. We are not afraid to do so, and as the posts above show. Regardless, for me the empirical evidence for LDS is just as strong for it as it is against. We have already been proven right in some instances. If our belief were founded on one DNA study, and not on Christ, we may have been shaken; yet our membership hasn't even dipped in the light of this study. As it is, a DNA study cannot controvert for me the witness of the Holy Ghost. Scientific theories come and go, but a witness of the Holy Ghost is constant.\n\n \n DNA analysis is a altogether different breed. We have already been proven right in some instances. Please name some.\n \n \nPerhaps we are, as you say, selective in the evidences that we accept. We prefer the evidences we feel in our hearts from (as we believe) the Holy Ghost. To some degree, aren't we all that way, as believers? \n \n\n \n All I can say is that the Holy Ghost would not lead you into error, thus, reason to question your belief as others do. \n \n \nMany Christians feel that evolution contradicts Adam and Eve, yet the seeming evidence for evolution continues to mount. \n\n \n There is obvious reason the assume that the earth is not a young earth.\n Evolution is a proposal, a theory, nothing more. Atheists and such who have no other belief prefer to believe evolution as it justifies their non-belief.\n \n Many Christians believe the history of the earth (or mankind in some beliefs,) is seven thousand years from start to finish, yet archeologists continue to disagree. Bark off a tree that was 20 years was dated to 40,000, faith is put into the dating method also. If it could be conclusively proved that dating methods are as accurate as DNA evidence has been conclusively proven, then that would be another matter.\n \n \nDinosaurs were also thought to eliminate the \"Garden of Eden,\" and the age of the earth. \n \n \n Dinosaurs do not necessarily eliminate the Garden of Eden.\n \n \nConsider, if you will, how crazy it must have sounded to claim that a man had risen from the dead? Science cannot support that.\n\n \n Let's focus on what science CAN support, like archaeological evidence.\n \n \nAsk any avid atheist to tell you how he feels Christians deny science and history. He will have an arsenal. How is this different?\n\n \n We are not discussing atheists, we are discussing questions I have on the Mormon divergence from Christianity, sic.\n \n \nPersonally, I am unsure as to why so many are so very eager to prove us right or wrong. We are less than 0.5% of the world's population. Many of the rest of the population does not accept Christ. There is war, hatred, and need nearly everywhere; and so many people have nothing better to do than to tear apart somebody's religion, or to prove something that can only truly be known as a matter of faith, not of tangible evidences. (in my mind, FARMS is guilty of this too...)\n\n \n We are on a debate forum so we will debate it..\n \n \nI weary of your mentality, which seems to me to be that this is a fight, to be won or lost. I am not interested in attack or defense. Admittedly, I created this thread on a \"debate\" forum, and you have every right to post so very aggressively. However, I meant this more as an explanation of our actual beliefs, because I found them misrepresented in such threads as this one: http://www.4forums.com/political/religion-debates/13865-did-god-have-sex-mary.html I meant merely to set forth what we believe in question and answer to posts like Easy's. Obviously, my beliefs are not acceptable to all, and heretical to many. Likewise many of your beliefs in my eyes. I think we all knew this to begin with. You have said this is not your first such discussion, and if that is true, then surely you have found what I did; that such discussions often become heated, and leave each side exhausted, angry and frustrated, but not convinced. I am willing to respond to your myriad of posts and claims, but keep in mind that I am not interested in converting, but in eliminating ignorance. Converting or convincing is not my job, it is the job of the Holy Ghost. Faith is a personal connection to and belief in God, and not the result of debate. I have never seen much of a point in what we LDS call \"bashing\", or religious \"proof\" debates. \n \n\n \n That may be the case, but again, I don't see many former Christians in need for counseling the way it appears the Mormons' do, but maybe I am mistaken.\n \n \nAnyhow, I find the historical and scientific evidences interesting, but do not base my faith on them. \n\n \n Again, you can base your faith as you please. \n \n\n \n See you tomorrow.\n\n Thank you.",

   "I have to go to work in a minute (as always, just a quick one...) Esdraelon, I'm jealous of how much time you have! Or how quick your fingers are. \n \n \nBoM: 1) \". . . for we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do.\" (Book of Mormon / 2 Nephi 25:23)\n Holy Bible: For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast. (Ephesians 2: 8,9 - true faith will have works (cf. James 2:17) but faith alone saves.)\n (bold, italics mine) Agreed! As a matter of fact, we completely agree with you as shown by the very scripture that you quoted. Please note the bolded, italicized word \"grace\". In full context, this scripture explains that even if we do all we can, we are still unworthy of heaven. We cannot ever hope to simply work our own way to heaven. Therefore, it is \"by grace that we are saved.\" One may vary well paraphrase like so \"Even all we can do is not enough, so it is still only because of the grace of God that we are saved.\" We emphasize the need for Christ; not supplant it. \n \n We most certainly agree that faith saves, which faith is incomplete without works, just like James says, but is still what saves. Nothing more. \n \n \nBoM: 2) . . I remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world.\" (Book of Mormon / Alma 36:17) (Italics mine)\n \n Notice that it says \"a Son of God.\" Jesus is the Son of God, not just a Son of God. \n 1 John 4:15 tells us, \"Whosoever shalt confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.\n Please note the entire wording here. \"one Jesus Christ, a Son of God,\" (italics added.) Surely you can't be serious in suggesting that we believe in many Jesus Christs? This passage is like me saying your post was from a certain Esraelon, in response to one romebigred. How many romebigreds are there to choose from on this forum? How many Esdraelons? Just one, or we wouldn't have been able to have registered these names. We wholeheartedly believe that Christ is the Only Begotten, the only Son of God. \n \n \n3) \"And behold, he shall be born of Mary, at Jerusalem which is the land of our forefathers, . . .\" (Alma 7: 10)\n But Jesus was born in \"Bethlehem of Judaea\" (Matthew 2:1 - cf. Luke 2:4 & Micah 5:2). Jerusalem is a distinct city and not \"the land of our forefathers.\" Furthermore, Jesus was born in Bethlehem which is a distinct town outside of Jerusalem (Emmaus and Bethany are closer to Jerusalem. He was not born in the district of Jerusalem but in the district of Judaea.\n This is in the Book of Mormon, about 500 years after the first writers left Jerusalem. Nephi (the first writer in the Book of Mormon,) refers to it correctly. He once lived there. By Alma, the usage had evolved. Jerusalem was 500 years ago, and across an ocean. No maps remained, no contact was maintained. Jerusalem became a term used among this people to describe that whole region. In this instance, they were spoken to in terms that they understood. The names \"Bethlahem\" and \"Judea\" would mean nothing to them. \n \n One of the only books that Joseph Smith had ever read at the time he translated the Book of Mormon was the Bible. I submit that even if he were making up the Book of Mormon, he had read the Bible too many times to become confused on such a basic and well-known point.\n \n That's all I have time for right now... I am eager to answer your other points. Hopefully this afternoon? I'm not sure. I have three mid-terms this week.",

   "Once again, I just have a minute. Esdraelon, I thank you for this portion of your post: \nI will quote your response above later, but let me make a few points to ease your mind.\n I am generally aggressive in a debate forum, however, I am not out to 'win' or 'lose' or show you up.\n It is not my intention to judge as you are free to believe what you like and your salvation is your own. The only thing I would tell you to be careful of is not to cause your brother/sister to stumble. \n This does indeed ease my mind. I find it odd that so many are quick to condemn me with venomous words when they find out that I am LDS. Not all of them, by any means; I have many very dear friends who are Baptist, Catholic, Evangelist, Assembly of God, non-denominational, Jewish, even Muslim and Buddhist. Anyhow, rest assured that I would never do anything to knowingly cause my brother or sister to stumble. What I do is what I am convinced is the right thing to do. I have a W.W.J.D. bracelet; a gift from a dear Baptist friend of mine. I wear it daily, and try to live by it the best that I can.\n \n \nThe Christian world by and large appears to hold your church as a cult, thus one would assume that there is grounds for doing such. \n Yeah, this one confuses me. I think it to be most likely a misunderstanding of definition. (Cult - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary) A cult is any religion. \"2 A system of religious beliefs and ritual; also : its body of adherents\" Catholics actually use it to describe various movements within their own church, such as the Franciscans. Definition 3 may shed more light: \"3 : a religion regarded as unorthodox or spurious; also : its body of adherents\" We are certainly unorthodox; we have many different beliefs from the majority of Christianity, even if we share many of the same practices. Whether we are spurious is debatable. The phrase \"a cult\" is often confused with \"occult.\" The literal definition is this: \"to shut off from view or exposure\" (Occult - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary) Our temple worship may be seen to fit this description. We keep it to ourselves with the belief they are sacred, and that it may only be spoken of within the walls of the holy temple. HOWEVER: the common use of both \"a cult\" and \"occult\" have much more commonly understood connotations, including devil worship, fundamentalist radical activism (often violent), witchcraft, brainwashing, and manipulation. None of these apply, and therefore I have never understood the claim that we are a cult or occult in this context. \n \n \nThere is a huge recovery umbrella on the web for former Mormons and Mormons wanting to leave the church, etc. Why is this?\n \n \nThat may be the case, but again, I don't see many former Christians in need for counseling the way it appears the Mormons' do, but maybe I am mistaken.\n I have many good friends who were once Mormon, and are no longer. I would put a rough estimate at about 50 that I have known. Of those, I maintain close contact with maybe 25-30. None of them described deep trauma; and none are in therapy. I would need more information as to what the nature of their counseling is; what the specifics of the difficulties are, and whether they are actually \"Mormon,\" or belong to a previously mentioned fundamentalist splinter group which purport to be \"Mormon,\" but have no affiliation. I would expect people from Warren Jeff's compound to need therapy, but I would not consider them to be Mormon.\n \n Here's the next part that I wanted to respond to:\n \n \n1. If Gods are individuals who have passed through mortality and have progressed to Godhood, how has one person of the Trinity (the Holy Spirit) attained Godhood without getting a body? (See Acts 5:3,4) Some Mormons say ya'll believe this Trinity? Is this true?\n\n \n God is more than just those who have passed through mortality, and have progressed. It is a being which deserves our worship. We are non-trinitarian. We believe that The Holy Ghost, Heavenly Father, and Jesus Christ are all God, but are separate beings. This does not mean that they do not deserve our worship. We do believe in the Holy Spirit as a spirit.\n \n \n2. If Gods are individuals who have passed through an earth life to attain Godhood, how is it that one person of the Trinity (Jesus Christ) was God before He received a body or passed through earth life? (Matt. 1:23 and Hebrews 10:5) Easy asked something very similar.\n See the above. \n \n \n3. If the Book of Mormon really contains the fullness of the Gospel, why does it not teach the doctrine of &#8220;eternal progression&#8221;? (See D&C 20:8,9) \n An easily understood misinterpretation of the word \"fullness\". Going back to where I said that the doctrine of Eternal progression was not something that influenced our daily practice, I was referring to the fact that it is not a \"saving doctrine.\" That is, it is not something that need  be known or believed to achieve salvation, or heaven. The \"fullness\" of the Gospel are the \"saving doctrines;\" the things relevant to how we live and what is necessary to know, understand, and believe. These are the things that pertain to Christ, his Sacrifice, the Holy Spirit and the witness of Christ that it gives, along with charity for all men, and how to strengthen ourselves against the temptations of the devil. The Book of Mormon focuses on those things. \n \n According to Joseph Smith, the Book of Mormon is only about 1/3 of the golden tablets. (Therefore he couldn't have claimed that there was nothing more to be known; just that all that was  necessary to know was there.) He was forbidden to translate the rest at that time. The reason was given that once we lived by what we had, and fully used it, we would get more. I don't think any Christian can say that Christians in general live by the Bible as much as they need to, and so it is with us.\n \n Thank you again for the quality of these last posts, and your patience that I can't respond to them all at once.\n Got to get to class again, see you soon.",

   "What a busy week! I'm currently sitting in class, but I have another 10 minutes before it starts. \n \n Response to Esdraelon's excellent post, part III:\n \n \n1) \"For I know that God is not a partial God, neither a changeable being; but \n he is unchangeable from all eternity to all eternity.\" (Moroni 8:18)\n\n \n This is most certainly true, as the Bible verifies multiple times. This is a very well-known point.\n \n \nAbout 14 years after the 1830 Book of Mormon came out, Joseph Smith refuted his own book! In a major sermon (see Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, compiled by Joseph Fielding Smith, p. 345) we read:\n \"We have imagined and supposed that God was God from all eternity. I will refute that idea, and take away the veil ...\"\n Now we come to the point where we discuss \"eternity\" and \"time\". It is a commonly accepted point that, \"Time is measured only unto man.\" In our doctrines, time works very differently for God than it does for us. One common way to put it is that all time is the present to Him. Given the theory of relativity, even physicists admit the theoretical possibility of such a thing. This makes the question, \"Was God always God?\" a sticky one. Yes, He always is and always has been, but given our linear mortal view of time, it is next to impossible for us to fully comprehend. (but physicists are on their way to it!) \n \n As an aside, I can understand why you would feel this to be a contradiction, just like I feel like the following excerpt from the Nicean Creed describing the Trinity to be self-contradicting; \" Now the Catholic Faith is this: that we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity. Neither confounding the Persons, nor dividing the substance. For there is one person of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the Holy Ghost. But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost is all one, the glory equal, the majesty co-eternal. For such as the Father is, such is the Son, and such is the Holy Ghost. The Father uncreate, the Son uncreate, the Holy Ghost uncreate; the Father incomprehensible, the Son incomprehensible, and the Holy Ghost incomprehensible; the Father eternal, the Son eternal, the Holy Ghost eternal. And yet, there are not three eternals, but one eternal. As also there are not three uncreated, nor three incomprehensibles; but one uncreated, and one incomprehensible...\" and it goes on for several more such statements. (Creeds of the Catholic Church) \n \n This confuses me further when understood from the context of John 17:3. \"And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.\" As I asked a seminarian in the Vatican who was a year away from becoming a catholic priests (after 7 years of school,) if we could ever come to know God, according to the Catholic interpretation, he responded that God was The Father Incomprehensible, and therefore we could not. I do not know what the Protestant interpretation is, but this view still has me confused.\n \n \n2) \"Behold, David and Solomon truly had many wives and concubines, which thing was abominable before me, saith the Lord.\" (Jacob 2:24)\n Perhaps Joseph had forgotten all about Jacob 2:24 when he had this 'revelation' recorded in Doctrine & Covenants 132: 1:\n \". . . I, the Lord, justified my servants Abraham, Issac, and Jacob, as also Moses, David and Solomon, my servants, as touching the principle and doctrine of their having many wives and concubines- \"\n We hold that polygamy is only permitted when God gives His specific approval, as shown by the fact that polygamy among early LDS was selected and not volunteer-oriented. It may be that God had not given His approval to these marriages; BUT far more specifically, it is what is written in Kings itself. \n s\n The following verses are from First Kings 11: 1 But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites;\n 2 Of the nations concerning which the Lord said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in unto you: for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love.\n \u0095 \u0095 \u0095\n 4 For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God, as was the heart of David his father.\n 5 For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.\n 6 And Solomon did evil in the sight of the Lord, band went not fully after the Lord, as did David his father.\n 7 Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.\n \u0095 \u0095 \u0095\n 9 \u00b6 And the Lord was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the Lordds God of Israel, which had appeared unto him twice,\n \u0095 \u0095 \u0095\n 11 Wherefore the Lord said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.\" 1 Kings 11 It seems pretty clear to me that God did not approve of these marriages which tore Solomon from the worship of the true God. The Jews had been commanded to marry only amongst their own specifically for this reason. Solomon disobeyed God's commandments of marriage.\n \n This next one I already covered, really... \"One\" in a figurative sense, like Mark 10:8 \"And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh.\" LDS believe the Nicean interpretation of \"One\" to be an overly literal interpretation.\n \n3) \". . . And now, behold, this is the doctrine of Christ, and the only and true doctrine of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, which is one God, without end. Amen.\" (2 Nephi 31:21) \n 'I will preach on the plurality of Gods. I have selected this text for that express purpose. I wish to declare I have always and in all congregations when I have preached on the subject of the Deity, it has been the plurality of Gods. ... I have always declared God to be a distinct personage, Jesus Christ a separate and distinct personage from God the Father, and that the Holy Ghost was a distinct personage and a Spirit: and, these three constitute three distinct personages and three Gods. ... we have three Gods anyhow, and they are plural; and who can contradict it?\" (as recorded in Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, p. 370)\n \n Who can contradict it? Well, consider 2 Nephi 31:21, Alma 11: 44, Mosiah 15:1-5, and \"The Testimony of Three Witnesses\" at the front of the B.O.M. (not to mention D. & C. 20:28)!\n (Bold added) As I said before, and cited biblical scripture to do it, we believe that they act as one. In various contexts, the word God has many different connotations in LDS scripture. There are false gods spoken of, God as in our Heavenly Father, God as in part of the Godhead (Father, Son and Holy Ghost), and God as a divine race. The reason that we still consider ourselves monotheists is because we believe that Christ said to the Father, \"Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever.\" Reference Search: Moses 4:2 This is to mean that He would serve God, but that He would not take Heavenly Father's place as our God. (meaning the Father that we pray to, and the one we hope to return to in heaven.) \n \n In many of our scriptures, it is not specified whether Christ or God the Father is speaking to us. This because it does not matter to us whose voice it is, because they all act as One. God the Father commands, and Christ and the Holy Spirit serve Him perfectly as He commands. Therefore their work is God's work, therefore we claim that they are one God. \n \n I hope this makes our belief somewhat clearer.",

   "\"plainess of the gospel\" (I Ne. 13:24)\n VS.\n \"fulness of the gospel.\"\n \n \"white and delightsome people\" (2 Ne. 30:6)\n VS.\n \"pure and delightsome people\"\n \n Why the change from white (skin-color) to pure (moral quality)? Probably this tampering with the text (which was faithful to the 1830 ed.) was an effort to remove a source of irritation for dark-skinned people.\n Plainess to fullness and white to pure is not changing the meaning. In the 1800's at the time of the publication of the BoM, \"Plainess\" was used synonymously with \"fullness\". \"The plain truth\" was full and unadorned. We do not have such a succinct phrase today, but \"fullness\" was considered to be the closest approximation.\n \n \"white\" to \"pure\" is a much more well-known one. Even to the 1930's, \"white\" was used as \"pure\" or \"good\". when somebody did something nice for another, \"that's awfully white of you,\" was a common reply. White was clean, without faults. \"Pure as driven snow\" is a phrase you might have heard. Why is snow considered so pure, when there must inherently be an impurity (dust particle, etc.) for the H20 molecule to stick to in order for an ice crystal to form? Why say it is pure? Because it is white. It was not referring to skin color, but to cleanliness. Dirt is far more evident on white linen than any other color. Nowdays, that usage has racial connotations, and is no longer so common. \n \n As to the \"battle in New York\", this is mistaking the hill Cumorah for the Battle of Cumorah. Moroni, the last writer in the BoM buried the plates in the hill Cumorah, and named it Cumorah after the name of the battle that was the end of his people. It was not the same place. Moroni wrote that he had wandered for 20 years after the destruction of his people. (Mormon 8) This was 20 years before he ended his account.\n \n Regardless, as my history professor says, \"The bulk of what we know is nothing compared to the bulk of what we don't.\" He compares archeology to an alien lowering a net down in a city, and coming up with a dog, a street sign and a few cigarette butts, and trying to piece together what happened. Even if we had claimed that this battle took place in upstate New York (far from the city), how much of upstate New York has been excavated in search of this battleground? Now, given the understanding that we believe that this happened in South America or Central America, and distant from their cities... This leaves a lot of area uncovered to search for a 1400-year-old battleground. (Reference Search: Mormon 6:1-4)",
