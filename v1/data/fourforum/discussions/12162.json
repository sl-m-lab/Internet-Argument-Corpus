However, Ethmi was originally asking me to define 'valid' for my original background check requirement (\"do they have a valid reason for owning a firearm?\")\n \n At the moment, there is no 'valid reason' included in the US system - probably because 'self-defence' automatically opens up ownership to everyone.

I'm not talking about the complete banning of guns, or a type of gun; I'm talking about removing a reason for issuing a licence.\n Once someone has the gun, if it is used in self-defence, so be it. There are no restrictions on that - just as I am perfectly free to use my hockey stick in self-defence in the UK (reasonable force levels notwithstanding).\n \n In the UK, that 'good reason' is checked by a personal visit to each applicant from a FEO (see here for more info on the UK procedure).
