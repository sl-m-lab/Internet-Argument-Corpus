   "No freedom of speech for Wilders in Europe | Washington Examiner\n \n \nLast month, the Dutch government commenced legal proceedings against a sitting member of parliament, Geert Wilders, for engaging in \"hate speech.\" Wilders' primary offense was producing the short film Fitna, which juxtaposed sanguinary passages from the Koran with grisly scenes of Islamist violence.\n \n A three-judge panel in Amsterdam ruled that the film-and some of Wilders more intemperate public statements, like his comparison of the Koran to Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf-warranted criminal prosecution, for he was making \"one-sided generalizations\" about Islam and was, therefore, \"insulting Muslim worshippers\" in Holland.\n \n If it was Wilders desire to provoke liberal governments into revealing a veiled intolerance of freedom of speech-while mollycoddling religious extremists-his mission has proved a gargantuan success.\n \n Last week, after being invited by a group of parliamentarians to screen Fitna at Westminster, Britain's Home Minister Jacqui Smith dispatched a letter to Wilders, declaring that he was persona non grata in London and would be prevented from entering the country.\n \n But Wilders, sensing an opportunity to further highlight the British government's illiberalism, travelled to London anyway, where he was swiftly detained and sent back to the Netherlands.\n \n It is hard to overstate the corrosive effect such rulings have on free speech-a point which seems so obvious as to barely merit further comment-but it is just as important to note that, in Britain, there exists an organized campaign to criminalize views critical of Islam.\n \n It began with the furor surrounding Salman Rushdie's \"sacrilegious\" and \"anti-Islam\" book The Satanic Verses. Indeed, the campaign's success is demonstrated by the uneven application of government crackdowns on offensive speech.\n \n The drive to prevent Wilders entry into the United Kingdom began with Lord Nazir Ahmed, the first Muslim member of the House of Lords. But Ahmed has had few problems with welcoming extremists of a different stripe into the country.\n \n In 2005, he invited the extreme anti-Semite J\u00f6ran Jermas-a man whose views are so noxious that Palestinian rights campaigners have specifically warned followers from mislabeling his racism as \"anti-Zionism\"-to hold a book release party from his offices in Westminster. In 2006, he invited Mahmoud Abu Rideh, an accused al-Qaeda funder previously imprisoned by British authorities, to Westminster to \"hear the detainees complaints.\"\n \n The former Mayor of London, left-wing firebrand Ken Livingstone, admitted to a BBC interviewer last week that he hadn't seen Wilders film, but had it on good authority that it was propaganda of the vilest sort. Because of this, Livingston agreed with Ahmed and the government of Prime Minister Gordon Brown that Wilders should be denied entry into the United Kingdom.\n \n But like Ahmed, Livingstone's standards of hate speech are malleable. As Mayor, he invited the Muslim preacher Yusuf al-Qaradawi to London, whom he defended as a \"moderate\" active in the battle against Islamic extremism.\n \n When it was revealed that al-Qaradawi defended suicide bombing, female genital mutilation, the killing of Israeli civilians, and the stoning of homosexuals, Livingstone sputtered that his critics were spreading \"lies and Islamophobia\" and that the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad was engaged in a campaign of misinformation against al-Qaradawi.\n \n In Britain, even criticizing Islamic extremism can attract the hate speech police. In 2005, independent television station Channel 4 broadcast the documentary \"Undercover Mosque,\" which caught spittle-flecked imams advising followers to \"kill\" the \"animal\" gays of Britain and to \"Take that homosexual man and throw him off the mountain.\"\n \n As a result, the West Midlands Police ended up investigati2ng the documentary producers for potentially misrepresenting the views of the preachers it profiled, stating that it was \"The priority for police has been to investigate the documentary and its making with as much rigout as the extremism the program sought to portray.\" They found no evidence of malicious documentary-making.\n \n While it is doubtless true that Wilders reductionist views on Islam should be opposed, the British government's one-sided attack on free speech only serves Wilders cause. Indeed, in many ways, British authorities have themselves internalized his views of Islam.\n \n Home Secretary Jacqui Smith's letter to Wilders argued bluntly that his presence would \"threaten community harmony and therefore public security.\" In other words, stay out or Britain's Muslims might resort to violence.\n\n \n I think this sums up Britain's approach pretty well.",

But even if there were we'd take an equally stellar stance against those. We don't want to hear about it.\n \n Second, most homosexuals who claim to be Christian try to persuade others it's not a sin, leading many (many) into perdition. We don't want to see even one soul lost. \n \n Third, most homosexuals distort the scriptures in some fashion or another in order to try to justify their sin. The distort who Jesus is (saying he's not God so he never spoke out against gay sex sin); they make lengthly arguments against Leviticus, Romans 1:26-27, I Corinthians 6:9-10, etc. Generally, they attack the Word of God and thus attack God himself. We defend the Word and God.\n \n Fourth: Sin is a reproach to individuals and nations and brings God's disfavor on men and nations.

Nine year old children shouldn't have to hear that Billy's daddy is doing another guy, or that it's ok to do it. They push their agenda in our faces until we're quite sick of it.

And religion has standards that dictate certain behaviors that are considered evil and unclean, just as we have laws that dictate behavior that's illegal. To claim people are bigoted due to religion isn't much different than claiming the legal system is bigoted.\n\n \n Yes, it is. It's a lot different. To a lot of people, religion is a fairy tale. Laws are not, they are real, and anyone who disobeys them will get a harsh reminder that they are real. Our country was founded on the idea of separation of church and state. Religion is not un-American, but religion in politics is.\n \n \nThese rules and standards are in place for a reason.\n \n And now it's time for a question that's in need of being asked. Why exactly should society as a whole be required to recognize any particular group, no matter how small or obscure, as having a legitimate claim to equality?\n\n \n This meets the definition of the slippery slope fallacy to a T, but I'll bite anyway.\n \n So lets say all human beings demanded equal rights. Other than 11 year olds drinking and owning guns, I see no problem with equal rights that don't interfere with others' rights. Pedophiles interfere with the rights of children, so they're out. Zoophiles interfere with the rights of animals, so they're out. Necrophilia interferes with the rights of the family of the dead body, so they're out. Anyone I'm missing?",

   "Just an observation I couldn't help but make regarding the direction this thread has been going.\n \n Jason quotes the section of the Declaration if Independence that says \"all men are created equal\". However there's nothing in the Declaration that says all groups and coalitions must be tolerated and accepted in an equal manner. Even back in Colonial days there were groups of people that were awarded do protection under the law even though the Founders believed that all men are created equal. There were laws that proscribed death for sodomy.\n \n Gay people claim that all they want is equality. But all of their screaming and protesting suggests otherwise. With the fit that's been raised over their group being called sinners by others, one can't help but feel that they don't really want equality, rather they want to be treated special and given more regard than anybody else. They want to be enshrined and made unapproachable by naysayers and critics of how they live.\n \n You don't get to have both standards applied. Either you're equal to others, or you're special and need special treatment. You're not in possession of some unique disability to requires society to afford you more protections and considerations than everybody else around you. Equality doesn't allow you to use public order laws to censor those that have a view differing from your own. The way you're responding to the words of this preacher would make one thing somebody was calling for euthanizig the physically disabled.\n \n There's simply no right of any sort to offer protection against being criticized, insulted, ridiculed or offended. That's part of life, everybody experiences it no matter where you look. You don't see the french trying to exploit public order laws anytime someone makes them the punchline in a surrender joke do you?",

   "Homosexual sin - No harm? \n \n Sure it's harmful, for a number of reasons. First, \"gay pride\" (two sins). They flaunt it in our faces and try to legitimize it. You don't hear of \"adultery pride\" parades or \"necrophilia pride\" parades do you? But even if there were we'd take an equally stellar stance against those. We don't want to hear about it.\n \n Second, most homosexuals who claim to be Christian try to persuade others it's not a sin, leading many (many) into perdition. We don't want to see even one soul lost. \n \n Third, most homosexuals distort the scriptures in some fashion or another in order to try to justify their sin. The distort who Jesus is (saying he's not God so he never spoke out against gay sex sin); they make lengthly arguments against Leviticus, Romans 1:26-27, I Corinthians 6:9-10, etc. Generally, they attack the Word of God and thus attack God himself. We defend the Word and God.\n \n Fourth: Sin is a reproach to individuals and nations and brings God's disfavor on men and nations. Read Deuteronomy chapter 28 to see the curses of disobedience.\n \n Fifth, they attack the Sons and Daughters of God when we stand up for the truth of God's Word. They call us bigots, homophobes, and all manner of names because we disagree with their stance.\n \n Sixth, they push their illicit agenda into every corner of America. Suing the Boy Scouts and anyone else who disagrees with them. They try and sometimes succeed in pushing their gay agenda in elementary schools and elsewhere where it doesn't belong. Nine year old children shouldn't have to hear that Billy's daddy is doing another guy, or that it's ok to do it. They push their agenda in our faces until we're quite sick of it. We don't need to know which way people perform sex acts. \n \n Seventh: (need I go on?) They (and heterosexual sinners) cost taxpayers untold billions in unnecessary health care costs to treat AIDS and other diseases they give to each other. It costs us all money out of our pockets.\n \n And eighth: They refuse to repent of it, making their own salvation and those who they lead astray a serious question mark.\n \n And there's more but that's for starters.\n\n \n Okay Sparkey, what is your source for this trash?\n I did a google search and - low and behold - I found you posted this text, word for word, on Sept 6, 2007: http://www.4forums.com/political/gay-rights-debates/10297-marriage-california-could-end-2.html",

The preacher is free to go.\n \n Christian preacher arrested for saying gays were sinful has charges dropped - Telegraph\n \n \nDale McAlpine, 42, was charged with a public order offence after telling a gay Police Community Support Officer (PCSO) that he believed homosexual activity was against the word of God.\n \n But the Crown Prosecution Service has confirmed he will now not face charges. \n \n Mr McAlpine welcomed the \"common sense\" decision.\n \n He said: \"It's good news. I'm relieved the police and the Crown Prosecution Service have finally seen sense.\n \n \"It was a ridiculous charge and I should never have been arrested in the first place. The whole thing was like fiction. It was surreal.\"\n \n Mr McAlpine, who works in the energy industry, was arrested on April 20 when he was handing out Christian leaflets in a shopping precinct in Workington, Cumbria.\n \n He was approached by a PCSO who introduced himself as the force's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender liaison officer and said their had been complaints about the leaflets.\n \n He was then warned that he could be arrested if he made any comments which were deemed to be racist or homophobic.\n \n Mr McAlpine replied that while he was not homophobic it was his belief that the Bible taught homosexuality was a crime against the Creator.\n \n A few minutes later he was approached by three regular uniformed officers who asked if he had made homophobic remarks.\n \n He repeated that he believed homosexuality was a sin and said there was no law against saying so.\n \n However he was arrested and taken to the police station where his fingerprints were recorded and he was forced to provide a DNA swab.\n \n He was placed in a cell for seven hours before being charged with causing harassment, alarm or distress contrary to the Public Order Act 1986.\n \n But yesterday the Crown Prosecution Service dropped the charge after deciding not to continue with the case.\n \n Chief Superintendent Steve Johnson, of Cumbria Police, said: \"Our officers and staff often have to make difficult decisions while balancing the law and people's rights. This is not easy especially when opinions and interpretations differ.\n \n \"We would like to reassure the public that we respect, and are committed to upholding, the fundamental right to freedom of expression.\n \n \"We are just as committed to maintaining the peace and preventing people feeling alarmed or distressed by the actions of others in public places. The Crown Prosecution Service has carefully assessed the evidence in the case and has decided to discontinue the prosecution of Mr McAlpine.\"\n",
