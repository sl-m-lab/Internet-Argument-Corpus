   "I read a report stating that there are estimated to be 38,000 different Christian denominations, 150 of them having 1 million or more members. Seperatly I read there are 50 different version of the Bible in English. With that much choice how does a Christian know that what they believe is correct? I don't mean something they all agree on like the resurrection, but why is a Catholic correct and a Protestant not or a Mormon right and a Baptist not or vice versa or replace those with any other denomination. \n \n Some will say most differences don't effect core beliefs (God doesn't seem that flexible, but I could be wrong) but at the same time the differences were enough to break away. Some are significant though such as the election of the Pope and his ability to determine doctrine. Others include\n \n Sacraments\n Purgatory\n Eucharist\n Inspiration & Inerrancy of the Bible \n Mary\n Immaculate conception\n Free will\n Perseverance Once Saved \n \n and others. \n \n All denominations think they practice they way God intended. They may try to be tolerant or unite under a common cause, but they can't all be right. So which one is and how do you know?\n \n From what I see it's opinion, personal preference, upbringing etc. There seems to be no conclusive evidence for one over the other. (at least for the larger, there probably is concerning the smaller fringe sects). My guess is many believe what they believe know they are right and the other is wrong but have never really thought long and hard about for something so important are the reasons good enough to bet their eternal soul.",

   "Pappillion, here's some information on the Holy Spirit and how he operates:\n \n THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT\n \n Not only does the Holy Spirit exhibit personal feelings and attributes, but He also performs a number of personal functions:\n \n 1. The Holy Spirit can speak: \"While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, 'Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them'\" (Acts 13:2).\n \n 2. He will convict the world of sin and guilt: \"When He comes, He (the Holy Spirit) will convict the world of guilt, in regard to sin and righteousness and judgment: in regard to sin, because men do not believe in me...\" (John 16:8-9)\n \n 3. The Holy Spirit teaches: \"But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.\" (John 14:26)\n \n 4. The Holy Spirit strengthens and encourages: \"Then the church throughout Judea, Galilee and Samaria enjoyed a time of peace. It was strengthened and encouraged by the Holy Spirit.\" (Acts 9:31)\n \n 5. The Holy Spirit testifies (usually about Christ): \"And it is the (Holy) Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth.\" (1 John 5:7)\n \n 6. The Holy Spirit purposefully leads: \"Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the desert to be tempted by the devil.\" (Matthew 4:1) This is a significant verse because it is written that God tempts no man (James 1:13), but it seems clear from scripture that it is occasionally His purpose to allow Satan to tempt man.\n \n 7. The Holy Spirit gives glory to Jesus Christ (which I believe is one of His primary purposes): \"He will bring glory to me by taking from what is mine and making it known to you.\" (John 16:14)\n \n 8. He searches all things: \"The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.\" (I Corinthians 2:10)\n \n 9. He creates: \"The Spirit of God has made me; the breath of the Almighty gives me life.\" (Job 33:4)\n \n 10. The Holy Spirit is instrumental in regeneration: \"I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Holy Spirit.\" (John 3:5)\n \n 11. The Holy Spirit indwells believers: \"And if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit, WHO LIVES IN YOU.\" (Romans 8:11)\n \n 12. The Holy Spirit anoints: \"But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know the truth.\" (1 John 2:20; also note the baptism of Jesus, when the Holy Spirit came to rest upon Him in the form of a dove).\n \n 13. The Holy Spirit empowers: \"But as for me, I am filled with power, with the Spirit of the Lord.\" (Micah 3:8)\n \n 14. The Holy Spirit gives joy: \"For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.\" (Romans 14:17)\n \n 15: The Holy Spirit sanctifies: \"....Sanctified by the Holy Spirit.\" (Romans 15:16)\n \n 16. He provides discernment: \"The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.\" (I Cor. 2:14)\n \n 17. The Holy Spirit gives spiritual gifts: Among these are the gifts of speaking in tongues, wisdom, knowledge, faith, healing, miraculous powers, prophecy, distinguishing between spirits, and the interpretation of tongues. (I Corinthians 12)\n \n 18. The Holy Spirit provides spiritual fruit: \"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.\" (Galatians 5:22) I like to teach that the first fruit, love, is incorporated into all the remaining fruit. For instance, because we love God's word and our fellow man, we are kind and patient with him, and so on.\n \n These, then, are some of the works and characteristics of the Holy Spirit that are seen in the New Testament church.\n \n THE HOLY SPIRIT IN THE LIFE OF CHRIST\n \n Author Kevin Conner lists the following evidences of the Holy Spirit working in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ (Conner 78):\n \n 1. He was born of the Spirit (Luke 1:35; Matthew 1:18-20).\n 2. He was filled with the fulness of the Spirit (John 3:34).\n 3. He was led by the Spirit (Matthew 4:1).\n 4. He was empowered by the Spirit (Luke 4:14).\n 5. He was anointed by the Spirit (Luke 4:18).\n 6. He spoke and taught by the Spirit (Luke 4:18).\n 7. He healed the sick by the Spirit (Luke 4:18).\n 8.

He was resurrected by the Spirit (Romans 8:11, I Peter 3:18).\n 12. He gave commandments to the disciples by the Spirit (Acts 1:2).\n 13. He baptized and empowered the church by the Spirit (Acts 1:5, 8)\n 14. He directs and governs the church by the Spirit (Revelation 2:7, 11).\n \n THE HOLY SPIRIT IN THE LIFE OF THE BELIEVER\n \n Conner also provides the following evidences of the Holy Spirit in the life of the believer, much like what we saw in the life of Christ (Conner 79): \n \n 1.

The Spirit strengthens the believer's inner being (Ephesians 3:16).\n 11. The Spirit enables the believer to pray (Jude 20; Romans 8:26-28).\n 12. The Spirit enables the believer to worship in spirit and truth (John 4:23-24; Philippians 3:3; I Corinthians 14:15).\n 13. The Spirit leads the believer (Romans 8:14).\n 14. The Spirit enables the believer to put carnal works to death (Romans 8:13).\n 15. The Spirit produces Christ-likeness in character and fruit in the believer's life (Galatians 5:22, 23).\n 16. The Spirit gives a calling to the believer for special service (Acts 13:2-4).\n 17. The Spirit guides believers into their ministry (Acts 8:29; 16:6-7).\n 18. The Spirit empowers the believer to witness (Acts 1:8).\n 19. The Spirit imparts spiritual gifts as He wills (I Corinthians 12:7-11).\n 20. The Spirit will bring about the resurrection and immortality to the believers' bodies in the last day (Romans 8:11; I Corinthians 15:47-51; I Thes. 4:15-18).\n \n TITLES OF THE HOLY SPIRIT\n \n 1.
