   "Ladies and gentlemen, never before in our country's history has it been more important to stand up to the enemies of freedom. The very fact that a radio program named Armed American Radio is on the air is a statement to those enemies in and of itself. The fact that we can educate and entertain while vocally pronouncing our God-given right to self defense and our Second Amendment rights on the nation's airwaves is testament to our will and the will of the USCCA to put itself out there. Believe me, I'm out there, really out there ... if there is some government list, I'm on it ... and I'm out there for a reason: Never before has this fight been more important to each and every one of us. Freedom in the United States is at stake--literally--and Armed American Radio is there as the voice of all of us. \n \n As of this writing, Armed American Radio is now in nine states and cities across the country, with more committed to joining the broadcast weekly. By the time you read this, we will have grown even larger. Please keep checking Armed American Radio for up to the minute information about where you can hear the program in your area as we explode across the country. Remember, keep calling those program directors at your local news/talk stations and ask them to carry Armed American Radio. It works! \n The Ordinary Guy: Armed American Radio - HUMAN EVENTS",
