   "as a longtime gamer, this has been bugging me for a while- finding this site is a godsend because now i can get this oppinion out.\n \n anyway, why is violence acceptable in american video games, but not sex? we have one of THE most up-tight sets of moral code in the world (if you want to argue that, look at how we started- a group of people so uptight the british kicked us out). its perfectly acceptable to have a sexy scantily clad female character get torn to pieces by the giant tentacled monster, but why does her top seem to be superglued to her flesh? if i'm seeing intestines spilling out and the contents of her stomach, am i REALLY going to have 'impure thoughts' when i see a nipple? hell no! anybody who does probably has issues outside the game in the first place (repressed sexuality from living in a bible-bashing christian home, for example ;) ). in all honesty, i think graphic violence in games SHOULD STAY, because not putting in the gore takes away the consequence from a bad action. but why not sex? as a first person shooter player, i can understand not putting it in, but what about role-playing games? pen-and-paper groups have had rules for sexual encounters for years, and the japanese video game market has incredible ammounts of porn in games. by why cant this come over to the states? it makes perfect sense, when you think about it- if you have sex, the npc (or you, or the other player, or whatever) might get pregnant, or transmit a disease to you, or so on. wouldn't that be a GOOD thing? if a kid gets their character to sleep with a slut in-game, and their character gets gonorrhea, wouldn't that teach them that sleeping with the loosest girl in town is a bit dangerous? you decide, and preferably post it here.",

   "I don't care what they put in video games. It can't be controlled without stepping on free speech.\n \n I do care what children are exposed to. (My children are grown and have their own children, all of which do not watch TV without their parents and do not play with violent or sex-oriented video games...and it's all because their grandmother wouldn't let their parents do any of those things either.)\n \n However, I believe that the TV, game and cartoon industries are slitting the throats of otherwise valuable children and causing them to be maladjusted to reality. Zapping things with a thumb button does not exist in real life unless you are at the controls of a real weapon and even then, it's nothing like the video game...you may actually kill something.\n \n I see more value in teaching children harmless arts and crafts, even if it's just wood carving, basket weaving, machine shop, horticulture, blacksmithy, origomi, pottery, sculture, bug collecting, astronomy or glass blowing than in teaching them to waste their money and time getting the high score on some meaningless video game. Teach them to be creative with their own hands rather than to be destructive and violent...we'll ALL be better off.\n \n You want a good game, try chess or pocket billiards. (You may be surprised at how much physics and trigonometry are involved in the game of pool.)\n \n However, the draw of violent and gorey video games is undeniably strong to children and many adults.

There are reasons these sorts of things have been considered taboo...... and they should remain that way. As humans we are too weak to handle it.\n\n \n what? the entire point i was trying to make is a way to TEACH US to handle it in a mature manner. having an invisible man in the clouds tell you it's a 'sin' is all well and good, but what about the rest of us who prefer to think for ourselves? i find people like you amusing, because all you have to back up your arguments is a 'the bible (or the quran, or the torah, or the book of XXXXX*cough* i mean mormon, etc) says so!'. i grew up not knowing the meaning of 'sex' (as in, i was about fourteen before i finally figured out what 'intercourse' was- i had looked it up in the dictionary before, but nobody was willing to tell me any more than that until i was that age). by that time, i was beginning to think for myself, and this discovery that there were things they were willing to hide from me opened the door: i stopped believing in god, because it made no sense to pray to an invisible man in the clouds, just because my parents/grandparents/the local preacher wanted me to. it made no sense to me to pray to some guy who had a divine plan anyway- whats the point of having a divine plan if some schmuck with a hope and a two dollar prayer book can come in and send it all to hell? if it was his plan, it was going to happen anyway- why bother to pray about it? so- as much as i hate to do it- knowledge is a way to keep your kids from asking 'uncomfortable' questions, and keep them from wanting to try things- because a game with sex doesn't convey the pleasure. if you're simply looking at pixels ****, then until consoles hook into your brain, its going to be impossible for anybody to get addicted to game sex. and since the main focus of sex is pleasure, removing the reward for an action shows them that its just basically two naked people hugging and going back and forth, occasionally with one on top. nothing terribly exciting, especially when they see bad things happening afterwards.\n \n as for the violence, i see it as the responsibility of the game developers to show that actions have consequences. if you take the graphic violence out of a game and just leave the violence (as in a cartoon game) they show no consequences for an action: why NOT push somebody off a cliff, if all that will happen is there will be a crater shaped the same as they are that they have to climb out of? they aren't going to die, right? they didn't in the game, after all.\n \n \n as for removing violent video games altogether, its not going to happen, period. violence is nearly as old as humanity itself, and is so deeply ingrained in our collective psyche that it is simply THERE. even young children will 'pretend fight', and hop around with sticks and such ('swords'). its everywhere in our media, because- simply- violence sells. we're fascinated by bloodsport: football (although not as bloody as it once was and some would argue should be) is a good example. a bunch of people fighting over a short oblong ball? count me in! wrestling? a homo-erotic blend of violence and acting- grown men in leather underwear touching each other in the name of pain. and any gun owner here will attest to the fact that the news crews only cover the fights that actually happened, not the ones that were prevented- if theres no blood, pfft who cares, right? even in the bible you so preciously hold dear, violence is everywhere. look anywhere in the old testament, and you're likely to find either a) a war, b) genocide, or c) slavery. any game based on the bible- if not for the fact that the book were so widely disbelieved and hated- would be a best seller, not because of the 'hidden messages pointing to the big picture', but because of the violence, sex, and general debauchery.",
