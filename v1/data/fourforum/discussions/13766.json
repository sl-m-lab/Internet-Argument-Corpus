   "I couldn't believe it when I first saw the news reports, but they are true. That XXXXX from FOX News, Brit Hume actually claimed that somehow what Tiger Woods needs is the forgiveness offered by his (Hume's) christian religion rather than Buddhism, which Hume believes is Woods' faith. Hume doesn't mention forgiveness from Woods' wife, which I feel would go a lot farther in solving the problem. But I don't see that happening (with justification) and I don't see christianity offering anything of value. The hubris is especially evident in the fact that as far as Hume is concerned, what his god joined together, he tore asunder. He is divorced and remarried, which means that he chose a civil means to dissolve an eternal christian union. He is now cheating on his wife with another woman, whom he claims is his wife.\n \n I thought christian marriage was sacred. Guess not.",

   "The hubris lies with you as usual. Brit Hume made a comment about Tigers situation which was his right and job since the issue was raised. This didn't mean he had to offer a dissertation regarding every aspect of Tigers personal situation with his wife. Obviously he was just commenting on his spiritual condition and he hit the nail right on the head. I understand why it would go right over your head though. emoticon_cool",

As is the attempted character assination of Hume. What ever his personal life has naught to do with his job which is a commentator. He mentioned Tiger would be better served because Bhuddism lacks the forgiveness angle of Christianity. The problem is Tiger's sexual escapades so his wife forgiving him is not going to do any thing to fix that. Or how do you turn a promisculous man into a monogamous one? You fail to understand that man is not a perfect creature. Which is why forgiveness is a central theme in Christianity. ",
