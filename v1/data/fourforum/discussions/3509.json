It's called \"thinking for oneself\".\n \n It's one thing to instruct and advise, another to demand adherance to the guidelines of Christianity via law.\n \n \nA secular country? That's only your opinion, far from being carved in stone. \"Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other\".- John Adams, 10-11-1798.\n \n I realize that just because Adams said it it's not carved in stone either, but it's quite debatable.\n\n \n OK - maybe not a secular country - there is all kinds of faith here. But government is to be secular. No state religion allowed. That may not be carved in stone, but it is in the constitution.\n \n NOW - PLEASE explain to me just how forcing somebody to adhere to the rules of your faith will do you, me, them or God one ounce of good.\n \n hmmm?\n \n Sounds like somebody is a control freak if you ask me.\n \n I would like to point out to you that the good lord provided each of us with free will. It's up to each person to accept God or not. Just who in the holy heck are you to usurp what God has granted? Not everyone has to obey the rules of your faith - even the freakin Bible acknowledges that. Watch your pride little man and mind your own keep.",

Within the structure of the Catholic Church, abortion is a sin. Therefore, anyone who participates in an abortion or knowingly promotes the availability of abortion is committing a sin. Kerry is essentially pro-choice. And as a president, he may be able to impact the availability of legal abortions. Therefore, a vote for Kerry could be extrapolated to be promoting the availability of legal abortions -- which is a sin. It makes perfect sense in a convoluted sort of way.\n \n I doubt there is an official Catholic teaching that a vote for a pro-choice presidential candidate is a sin, however.
