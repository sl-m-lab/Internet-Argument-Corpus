So how do you seperate the good from the bad, the just from the unjust? They tend to resist analysis by their very nature, so how can you tell?\n\n I'm using the phrase 'just prejudice' in a restricted sense taken from the political philosophy of Edmund Burke - whom I cited in an earlier post.\n \n What Burke is referring to are the customs, habits, and traditions that we acquire almost instinctively - or at least without previous rational analysis. Reason can be the front behind which lurk the preferences of one individual, and at best it represents the untested sagacity of just one generation. But tradition draws upon the wisdom of many generations and has stood the tests of time. So any institution or value system which has been subjected to the prudence and correcting influences of past experience should not be lightly abandoned in the name of 'progressive' idealism. \n \n To clarify the picture a bit more, here's Burke's own words: \"Prejudice is of ready application in the emergency; it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue, and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision, skeptical, puzzled and unresolved. Prejudice renders a man's virtue his habit; and not a series of unconnected acts. Through just prejudice, his duty becomes a part of his nature.\"\n \n I know this has been an unfashionable point of view for a long time. Since the Enlightenment, the intellectual history of western societies has been ornamented with the triumphs of rationality. And I'm not trying to nullify the great achievements of rational enquiry. However, I am calling for a sceptical attitude towards the airy abstractions by which rationalists operate and upon which they push through ill-considered social and cultural changes. \n \n James.",

The problem was that Lenin was a bit psychotic in the \"end justify the means\" sort of way, and Stalin was more than a bit. The 5 year plans of the 20s and 30s took Russia further and faster than anyone thought possible, and even by the 1980s most people were better off than they are today.

I would define prejudice, bigotry and dogmatism only slightly differently.\n \n Prejudice comes from the latin pr\u00e6judicium. It means \"Prior Judgement\". General usage means to come to a belief prior to knowing any information. I would not say without reasoned support. As the historical usage tends to delineate prejudice from illogic. Prejudice indicates a lack of knowlege not an illogical process. There are those who use perfectly good reasoning but are still prejudice. It is because there assumptions are incorrect. If you start with a bad assumption you will necessarily come to a bad conclusion if you follow a logical process.\n \n Bigotry comes from the old french (circa 12th century) and is a reference to religious hypocrisy, particularly female hypocrits. There is some historic reference to its use in france to refer to the normans. Therefore it is not a fixity of unreasoned values, rather it is a value imposed on others when it is not accepted by myself. A good example would be a church that is active against a local bar where many parishoners patronize.\n \n dogmatism: Is simply stated a world view. It is what one believes to be true. It comes from the greek dogmatos which literally means opinion or tenet. Here I would actually agree with your definition.\n \n (I have to post ten times to post links so please see etymonline website to verify my etymologies.)\n \n However, that being said, I would say that even though there may be a natural predisposition towards such things your argument begs the question that there is nothing that can be done about that. You simply assume that nothing can be done about it because it is \"natural\". Or you assume that we would not want to because it is natural. You offer nothing to support this thus the begged question.\n \n My support would be that people overcome such things all the time. It is good when they do. Dr. Phil even (and I do not say that he is authoritative but does represent the concept well and can be verified on the internet) had several episodes devoted to \"the house of hate\" where many of those that entered actually overcame their prejudices etc. and believed themselves to be healthier happier people.\n \n I just see no support for your suppositions.\n \n Huck",

   "I'm not sure why you give etymologies for bigotry, prejudice and dogmatism. I think I know what they are, and I gave brief definitions of them in my opening post.\n \n In subsequent posts my focus was on 'just prejudice' - an idea borrowed from Burke which I argued has social utility. \n \n There is no point in duplicating what I said in my conversation with Kronus (see posts #2-16 - which I assume you've read), so perhaps you can explain what you think I'm asserting. \n \n James.\n\n \n In debate- when one presents definitions and then another pronounces counter definitions it is incumbent to argue for the betterness of the definitions. I think I did that in my first post. I pointed out what I disliked about your definitions. I was arguing the original things that you said and not continuing in the thread but rather starting with a \"clean slate\" by giving the actual etymologies and why i had problems with your original definitions. I realise this is not debate - but it is kind of ingrained in me. Sorry about that.",
