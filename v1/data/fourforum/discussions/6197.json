If you were, you wouldn't have an opinion differing from policy as that would hinder your career path. Can you say sheep?",

   "Oh yeah, toddlers and children under age 2 are really dangerous monsters. They should be kept on a leash or something. emoticon_rolleyes\n I jest, of course. That's about the second stupidist thing I herd (okay, I guess I read it) about people on a Terrorist no-fly list. The first was last year. They said that the aritst Cat Stevens was not allowed into the country because he was a terrorist. How stoopid (misspelled on purpose) can those people be. The guy who sang \"Peace Train\" and the song \"Morning Has Broken\" (which, by the way, the choir at my church has song that) is an evil terrorist.\n All those people should chill and worry about the real dangers. :xbanghead",
