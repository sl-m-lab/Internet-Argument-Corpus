   "I thought this was very clever.\n \n http://today.uci.edu/news/release_detail.asp?key=1564\n \n Scientists are tracking CO2 emissions using corn. They're taking corn from around the country and checking its carbon-14. \"Natural\" CO2 has a certain percentage of carbon-14, but CO2 from fossil fuels has none. By checking how far below the expected value the carbon-14 in a sample of corn is, they can tell how high the CO2 emissions from fossil fuels are in an area, and how the emissions spread. Clever.",
