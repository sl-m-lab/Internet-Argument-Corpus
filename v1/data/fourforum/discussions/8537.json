   "As the situation blossoms into a fully combat or otherwise called war,Israel still feels that the reaction pertaining kidnapping by using full force is an appropriate way to settle this problem.There are,however, series of serious consequences entailed after Israel's action. How a nation without any allies in the continent stands against surrounding of angry and unforgiving arab nation? As stupid as it sounds, while attacking her neighboring country, Israel are still pleading to the world that her act was justify against terrorism that happen in her country. How could someone say that killing hundred and thousand of people isn't disproportionate with kidnapping two Israelis soldiers?\n Eventhough their demand is deemed to be impractical and unacceptable, should there be a better solution than fully confront to each other with WMD?\n This idea of handling foreign affair in this manner is to be known as American stupid way. So as my curiousity go on and on, I wonder if there really are a kidnap of two soldiers or it 's just an excuse to the world for attacking Lebanon like the famous WMD.emoticon_xhohoTO US and Israel, let the world be the largest graveyard.",
