   "Nation & World | Jamaica: 3 smuggled weapons, ammunition from NY | Seattle Times Newspaper\n \n \nKINGSTON, Jamaica -\n \n Authorities in Jamaica have arrested two men and a woman they say helped smuggle 12 high-powered weapons and 700 rounds of ammunition from New York.\n \n Police Inspector Jubert Llewellyn says the items arrived inside an air compressor tank. He says a telescopic lens and 28 magazines were also among the items seized at a warehouse Monday.\n \n Llewellyn said Tuesday that local police are investigating the case with help from U.S. authorities.\n \n Jamaica had a record 1,680 killings last year, most of which police say were committed by gangs who use illegal guns.\n\n \n Weapons smuggled out of New York, the state that's supposed to have such tough anti-trafficking laws on the books. How do you explain this one away?\n \n If criminals can get guns from the state of New York and traffic them out, then the state has no right to be complaining about the \"lax gun laws\" of other states around the country.",

   "Guns flood Jamaica from U.S. officials say - SFGate\n\n \n Thanks for posting. There are some choice bits in that article I feel are worth posting.\n \n \nThe volume is much less than the flow of U.S. guns into Mexico that end up in the hands of drug cartels - Jamaican authorities recover fewer than 1,000 firearms a year.\n\n \n \nBut they have a long way to go. Jamaican authorities have confiscated only 100 guns coming into ports in the last five years, along with 6,000 rounds of ammunition. That in turn is just a fraction of the 700 or so weapons confiscated on the streets each year.\n\n \n \nthe gangs are blamed for 90 percent of the homicides in Jamaica - 1,611 last year, about 10 times more than the U.S. rate, relative to population.\n\n \n And with strict gun control laws too. Wow, who would've believed such a thing were possible.\n \n \nX-ray scanners were installed two years ago at Jamaican ports, but the gangs use bribery and intimidation to get their shipments past inspectors.\n \n In April, a newly hired customs supervisor had his tires slashed and days later was shot at on his way home from work, authorities say. The man was known for his strict scrutiny of cargo coming into a gang-infiltrated warehouse on the Kingston wharf.\n \n When the gangs apply pressure, \"no one says no,\" said Danville Walker, Jamaica's commissioner of customs.\n\n \n \nIn one of the few Jamaican gun-smuggling cases prosecuted in the U.S., Tawanna Banton, 36, of Florida was convicted of buying a Glock handgun later used in the gang killings of four island police officers. She said her Jamaican boyfriend arranged the purchase, and she was paid $15,000 to buy the handgun and a .50 caliber \"Grizzly\" rifle with a tripod mount, according to court documents.\n\n \n $15,000 in bribe money to make a purchase. Wow. Where are the gangs getting all of it?\n \n \nBanton pleaded guilty to making false statements to the gun dealer in 2006 and served a month in prison.\n\n \n One month in prison, for a crime that's supposed to carry a mandatory 10 years. Actually 20 years since she lied twice.\n \n \nBesides coming in on freighters, authorities say, guns are stolen or purchased from crooked police or in \"guns-for-ganja\" deals by fishermen, who bring homegrown marijuana to nearby Haiti and return with pistols, revolvers and submachine guns - many of them believed to be from the U.S. as well.\n\n \n Submachine guns? From America? Not a possibility unless they're being stolen from the military.\n \n \n\"The guys we're up against, they have time, they have money, and they are very resourceful,\" said Andrew Lamb, a supervisor with Jamaica customs' Contraband Enforcement Team. \"They're pretty good at what they do.\"\n",
