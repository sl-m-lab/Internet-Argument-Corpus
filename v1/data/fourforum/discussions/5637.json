Several commercial airliners had to be delayed and rerouted so that the French planes could land.\n \n \n I have no idea where they keep Air Force 1.\n\n You really twisted this story around. \n \n The French planes were conducting ops off the coast of the US, and were supposed to land on their carrier off the Virginia coast. They were unable to return to their carrier due to weather, and were becoming low on fuel. They sought permission to land at a US military base, which was denied because they lacked a proper clearance number (perfectly legal). They then sought permission to land at Atlantic City, and were able to land. They had not declared an emergency, however had stated minimal fuel. This is the step prior to an emergency, meaning the aircraft is low on fuel, and any undue delay will cause the pilot to declare a fuel emergency. The aircraft then had a problem paying for their fuel. Combined with thunderstorms preventing them from returning to their carrier, they remained parked at the FAA ramp at Atlantic City. \n \n As a pilot, I can tell you that this was little more than poor planning on the part of the French pilots, and lack of procedural knowledge. Aircraft cannot land at any US military institution without a DOD issued permit, or granted permission in an emergency. Had they declared an actual fuel emergency, they would have been directed to the nearest suitable airport, military or civilian. The pilots should have been aware of deteriorating weather, and their fuel status prior to reaching the point of stating minimal fuel. \n \n \nAnd some Americans still wonder why people don't like them...\n\n Perhaps because of people like you who don't understand a situation and instead of getting educated about the facts, simply misconstrue the facts to make the US look bad. Shame on you.",

Friendly war planes are generally granted clearance to land at military bases, even lacking a clearance number. An emergency landind permit should have been issued. This is simple a curtesy that most nations extend, even to enemies, because fighter planes have different maintenance, security, and fuel requirements than commercial planes. Emergency or not, they should heva been allowed to land at andrews.\n \n Honestly it sounds like a screw up by some low level numbskull at andrews who was preprogrammed to deny permission to land without a clearance number.",
