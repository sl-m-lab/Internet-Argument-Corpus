Around me were several smiling children with their mothers and grandmothers. Each of their faces reflected a genetic heritage shared with the ancient people who lived in that land long before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors.\n \n It was late November 2005 and I was in Mexico to receive a journalism award from the Population Institute, an international educational organization based in Washington, D.C., that seeks to increase awareness of the perils of rapid population growth. Other journalists from around the world, as well as Population Institute staffers and supporters, had journeyed with me from Mexico City (at 15 million people, one of the world's largest cities) to this remote little town. The villagers seemed honored by our visit but, by the time we departed, we were the ones who felt honored to have spent time with them.\n \n Rosa Lopez stood at the chalkboard and spoke to us. Lopez was a small woman with minimal education and membership in the world's largest club, the poor, but she had bravely taken on the task of creating a revolution in her community. As the local representative of the Mexican family planning organization, Mexfam, she was teaching the women of her village to stand up for themselves and the men to redefine their image of manhood.\n \n She held up drawings that she uses when she talks to her neighbors. One showed a family locked inside a house, virtual prisoners of the father and husband. Another pictured a wife being forced into sex by an abusive spouse while their children looked on. All the drawings illustrated a type of violence against women and children, from verbal and emotional violence to physical harm.\n \n Lopez's message is that it does not have to be this way; that life will be better when women are free to obtain education and find work, when children can express themselves and live without fear and when men stop using their fists and start opening their hearts. It is the culture of male machismo that she is trying to deconstruct, the set of traditional male attitudes that hold women in subservience in much of Mexico and throughout the developing world.\n \n Lopez brought her husband forward and he testified to the positive change in his own life since he has tried to dispense with the old macho cultural reflexes and become a true partner with his wife. Apparently, El Salto was being transformed, house by house and family by family. As the two Mexicans described this change, I realized very little was being said about population control. Yet it was there in the subtext.\n \n One of the byproducts of empowering women in Mexico has been a dramatic drop in the country's rate of population growth. In 1972, Mexicans averaged seven children per family, one of the highest birth rates in the world. The country appeared to be on the road to ruin with the number of its citizens skyrocketing toward a level that would far outstrip the nation's economic and material resources. Today, that fertility number has dropped to 2.1, bringing Mexico close to the levels of the United States and Europe. It's a remarkable success story.\n \n While Mexico's population has doubled from 50 million to 100 million over the last three decades and is projected to reach 130 million by 2040, at that point it will level off, thanks to the sharp decline in the fertility rate.\n \n What made this happen? A pivotal moment came in 1974 when the Mexican Constitution was amended to guarantee the right of all citizens to choose the number of children they would have and with what frequency. Contraception had been illegal up to that point; all at once, family planning became the law of the land.\n \n The result? Despite the fact that Mexico is heavily Roman Catholic, 74 percent of married woman now use contraceptives.\n \n (More)",

   "In addition, the participation of women in the Mexican economy has increased from 14 percent to 40 percent and the number of years of education for the average female has risen from 3.4 to eight.\n \n The population problem is not yet completely fixed in Mexico. Poor, rural and indigenous women still have high birthrates, and that means the proportion of people in poverty is actually increasing.\n \n And because all the babies born in the high birthrate years are now of working age, there are not enough jobs in Mexico for all of them. That is a big reason why 400,000 Mexicans move to the United States every year and another 500,000 migrate back and forth across the border in search of seasonal work. Whole towns in many parts of Mexico become incomplete communities of women, children and old men bereft of the younger men who head north to find jobs.\n \n Nevertheless, because Mexico has defused its population bomb, it is on the verge of becoming a fully developed economy that should be able to provide for its people in the years to come. By 2015, the working-age population will drop and migration will become less of a necessity. \n \n The day could come when Americans no longer complain about illegal Mexican immigrants and instead wonder who is going to pick their lettuce and apples.\n \n For years, we have all heard dire warnings about the global population explosion and, despite successes such as Mexico, worry is still warranted. The Earth's current total of human beings is 6.5 billion, more than double the number in 1960. By 2050, there will be more than 9 billion of us. Because 99 percent of that growth will be in the poorest countries of the world, the potential for mass starvation, uncontrolled migration and severe environmental damage is huge.\n \n The problem seems so great that it is tempting to opt for ignorance. Why lose sleep over something that cannot be changed? It's easier to plug our ears when some badgering Cassandra delivers the latest bad news about population.\n \n But what if we look at it another way? What if we consider the example of Rosa Lopez and the women of El Salto? What if we make the liberation of women our focus? Suddenly, a happy result might seem more attainable because, woman by woman in poverty-stricken villages throughout the developing world, progress is being made. Micro loans in Central America, AIDS education in Africa, schools for girls in Asia -- in more and more places the seeds of change are being planted.\n \n And when women are better educated, when they can find work that will lift them from poverty, when they are freed from traditional religious and cultural practices that subject them to the cruel whims of unenlightened men, there is an inevitable byproduct: They bear fewer children.\n \n Liberate women and humanity might just be able to save itself from too much of a good thing.\n \n David Horsey is a P-I editorial cartoonist and columnist and member of the P-I Editorial Board.",

Do you think the cultural differences between the US and the poor in Mexico aren't that great? I assure you they are. My ex-husband was of this culture - how he was taught to treat women eventually led to our divorce.\n \n I think it is a positive article. Any action that both men and women can take to acknowledge, respect and empower each other is a good thing. How can it possibly be a good thing to keep something as wonderful and capable as a woman down? For the woman or the man? She is a virtual prisoner and he is losing out on truly meaningful partnership and friend.\n \n I also read an article a couple of years back about how Mexican women are finding empowerment because of the number Mexican men who head to the states to work. Being alone teaches them that they are capable and they are standing up for their right to manage their own lives. (They go out, make their own money, etc.)",

I found several other mentions of business investments by the bin Ladens, but nothing about bailing out...as in personal loans or grants. I have not yet equated investing in a faulty business with bailing out the owners. I merely question the choice of wording by the usually proper simone.",

I merely question the choice of wording by the usually proper simone.\n\n \n Bush Jr. had a string of business failures which any impartial observer would classify as favors called in; investor money in start-ups down a rat hole to keep the family from directly writing him paychecks. Lots of ME money involved, not hard to do when your father is furnishing the Sauds with the latest in US Military hardware and support platforms. The Bin Laden family was and is the giant of Saud civil engineering and construction, which in any country at all levels is joined at the hip to politics. At that level of wealth, favors and capital investments on the relatively small scale of Bush Jr.'s endeavors would be pocket change and good for business. \n \n He made his personal money through a small investment of borrowed money in the Texas Rangers Franchise, where he acted as a front man while pros put it together. He had no management status. That wealth came from condemnation and under-appraisal of public land combined with a public bond issue for the stadium and packaged with the franchise for later sale as a private entity.",
