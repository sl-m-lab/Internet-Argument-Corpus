I suppose the irony is lost on you...\n \n \nDid anyone see this very interesting documentary?\n\n \n I saw it. It's been my favorite of Moore's work, I haven't liked his earlier pieces nearly as much.\n \n His arguments come off well, in particular his exposure of the true nature of the NRA. I also liked his \"interview\" of Bob Hope, especially since he kicked the bucket recently and people were making a huge deal about how \"great\" he was. Meanwhile the work-farers in his restaurant chain are working for squat.\n \n Equally powerful was his interview with Marilyn Manson (re: his being targeted following the Colombine shootings because the kids listened to his music). I'm not a fan, I always thought people made an absurdly big deal about him (fans or protesters). He comes off so much more intelligent than most of the other people interviewed, it almost made me want to buy an album. Er, almost...\n \n All in all I thought he made a good point, although I don't believe the Toronto stunt. Toronto is so huge, and he was in the outskirts of the suburbs, so of course he found lots of people with their doors open. Maybe that wouldn't be the case in a US suburb, but it wouldn't be the case in downtown Toronto either.\n \n The cartoon by the people who do South Park was also funny.",

But conversely, I know a lot of people who open their locked doors to talk to strangers....\n \n Some years ago I worked for my local council helping frail and aged people. We'd go and collect them on a bus and take them back to a community centre for activities. Even when I just started, I'd go up to someone's house, say I was from the council, and they'd open the door straight away. Although they'd be expecting someone, I'm quite a large and ugly bloke (many people think I look like a 'biker'), so opening the door to me makes no sense, if you don't know me.

The measurement of spending in relation to population share is a useful method of controlling for demographic shifts, but there may be little reason to argue that expenditures by age should be in proportion to an age group's presence in the population.\"\n \n So, it is hardly suggestinve of outrageous spending! They are saying that they don't know!\n \n \n Futher it said...\n \"Public social spending on children and youth is often viewed as an \"investment\" that can not only improve the quality of life and well-being of our young people today, but can bring with it a significant longer-term \"payoff\" tomorrow.\"\n \n They recognise that they should have a social service system, as an investment for the future...
