   "There are a few very upset state Senators in Illinois who want the \"sexual orientation\" language removed from the state's Human Rights Act. This historic legislation was signed into law by Illinois Govenor Rod Blagojavich just this January and is to take effect June 1st of this year. \n But state Senator Randall Hultgren believes it needs to be removed from the state's Human Rights Act. Stating:\n \"There is strong evidence that the slope leading from gay marriage to polygamy and incest is indeed slippery...The arrogance and presumptuousness of homosexuals in the United States tempts the Lord.\" \n \n Cosponsors of this removal bill are: David Reis (from downstate Olney, IL), Shane Cultra (a tiny town in Iroquois county, IL just south of Kankekee County), Chapin Rose(of Charleston, Il home of Eastern Ill University), Art Tenhouse (of Far Western Quincy, IL) and Dave Winters (of NorthWestern Rockford Ill). \n [note; all of these places are well known as Concervative/Christian areas of Illinois]\n \n After fourty years of struggle to ensure employment and housing non-discrimination for gay and lesbian residents of Illinois, there are still those holdouts who are willing to stop at nothing to make Illinois one of the most unfriendly states to live in. \n \n Read the Bill: http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocNum=3741&GAID=8&DocTypeID=HB&LegId=20279&SessionID=50&GA=94\n \n Read Equality Illinois' Press Release: http://eqil.org/\n (scroll down the main page to where you will see a link that reads: We're under attack in Springfield! \n March 22, 2005\n click on that to find the press release)",

Why undo this, of all things? \n \n I'm not really too concerned though. The ones who are sponcering this are from podunk little nothing towns with populations all combined which don't even amount to one of the near Chicago suburbs. My only concern is if it gains any kind of press attention. So far it hasn't even caused a ripple.",
