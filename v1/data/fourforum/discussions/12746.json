   "Very often, it is irresponsible sexual practices or insufficiently responsible sex that leads to the unwanted pregnancies that lead to abortion. By reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies through proper contraceptive use (including doubling up to reduce pregnancy risk) or abstinence for those that can be convinced, one would then automatically reduce the number of abortions. I think this is one area where our two sides actually agree in the general idea that it would be good to reduce the number of abortions by reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies. Imagine what could be accomplished if our sides actually worked together in this direction. I think that the devil is in the details, though, in how each of our sides would work to achieve this.\n \n So, what are your views on how best to decrease the number of unwanted pregnancies and why do you hold those views? Do you advocate teaching abstinence only? Teaching proper contraceptive use in school? Other ideas? \n \n ------------------------------\n As for my own view:\n In another thread, Esdraelon made a good point that the existence of the abortion option might leave people with some excuse or lack of enthusiasm for fully practicing responsible sex. As a pro-choice supporter, I certainly would not condone making abortion illegal in order to promote more responsible sex. However, I will admit that I, along with many on the pro-choice side, do not put as much of our energies as we perhaps should into pushing for more reponsible sex to begin with since we find the abortion debate far more compelling and important.\n \n Instead of limiting abortion options to promote sexual responsibility, I, along with many on the pro-choice side, think that the number of unwanted pregnancies can be reduced through education on responsible sex in the schools. Teaching them at this time in their lives is important since students are still in a learning mode, and since it is one of the few opportunities where one can force them to listen to the methods of proper contraceptive use. If one does not teach people about responsible sex in school, then one may never have another opportunity - so that many people start their sexual lives with neither school nor parents to influence them in practicing safe sex (at least for those whose parents have either insufficient responsibility or insufficient influence to be able to teach them). Unfortunately, many on the pro-life side don't believe in teaching students about safe-sex practices through contraception since they view that it is a message to them that it is OK to practice pre-marital sex. Therefore, they only want to teach abstinence. I can understand the concern of sending unintended messages but I think that the consequences of not teaching them safe sex are worse, given the reality of American culture. Large numbers of students will just roll their eyes at such teaching and continue having sex anyway though, now, without the benefit of having learned how to practice it safely.\n \n Therefore, I do not support abstinence only education. However, I do support the efforts on the pro-life side of making virginity in teenagers seem less un-cool by showing off young teenage celebrities that are proud of their virginity. This helps make abstinence a more acceptable option for teenagers. So, I have no problem with the pro-life side trying to teach abstinence - as long as it is not at the exclusion of also teaching good sexual practices through contraception.",

The only debates that do occasionally arise occur when someone on the pro-life side suggests abstinence only education, and is then attacked by those on the left. I am glad to see that there are many on the pro-life side that agree that abstinence only education might not work. I genuinely believe that better sex education in the schools and a cultural stress at keeping sex safe would go a long way in reducing unwanted pregnancies. Now that AIDs is not as dangerous, it seems that there is less of a cultural push for safe sex than there used to be - since condoms preventing spread of AIDs could also prevent unwanted pregnancies. \n \n Anyway, this topic will unfortunately likely die out.

In the UK, it is only third trimester abortions that are restricted. Where US polls are concerned, it seems that they also would agree with you - over 80% of Americans would restrict third trimester abortions, about 2/3rds would restrict second trimester abortions, and about 2/3rds would keep first trimester abortions generally legal (this from a 2003 CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll one can find at pollingreport.com).",

Don't dress like a whore and you won't get a guy who wants a whore thus lowering your chances of getting raped. Always be able to understand discussions you make.

It appears we have a decent cross-section of people here and a lot of well thought-out discussion.emoticon_xhoho\n\n \n \n Might be better if some read the thread before jumping to conclusions. \n \n Anyway. I'm pretty sure that most people want the amount of abortions to be severely lowered. I'm just not willing to risk the elimination of women's rights.",

   "Why not a little modesty on the woman's part? If the woman doesn't want to be raped, and a woman dressed more like a whore has a better chance of being raped, why is it so hard to admit that women should dress more modestly? The responsible thing for the girl to do would to cover up some more skin.\n\n \n What exactly is dressing like a whore? A nice dress and heels? If someone wants to look good and looks sexy, they are considered dressing like a whore? \n \n This is going way back to the culture of middle eastern countries!",
