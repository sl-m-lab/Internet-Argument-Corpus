There is nothing good in using illicit drugs. The drugs these days are addictive upon one use. Crack cocaine was used to reward rats for pressing a bar. After one administration, the rat would press the bar to exhaustion forsaking all other activities including food, water, and sex. \n \n The government has a responsibility in the public education system to use resources efficiently and to identify people with mental health issues. Drug abuse or even use would be among them. I don't think expulsion on first use is the correct answer but certainly testing is necessary. My company drug tests as do most these days. Why should the school not? The safety and health of all is at stake. Is it okay for a boy in shop class to be high while assisting another with a lathe. i think not. Drugs Hurt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! There is no \"as long as I don't hurt anyone but myself.\" They hurt the person using, the person who loves them, and potentially those in their path. \n \n Again the government has a responsibility to protect those in the public education system.",

Kinda funny though that this was what the government was telling everyone when they first placed marijuana on the controlled substance list. There are many studies showing the beneficial aspects of marijuana. It is beneficial in reducing pain and ocular pressure associated with glaucoma. It is usefull in stimulationg the appetite of AIDS patients to prevent AIDS related wasting. It is usefull in Pts. getting chemotherapy to reduce pain and alleviate chemo related nausea. Actually there is a drug called Marinol that contains the same psychoactive compound (D9-THC). While smoking pot may lead to lung cancer and other related health risks, it can be delived in other ways such as teas or food which eliminate these health risks. I have no doubt that you come across many people who have serious psychological problems. I have no doubt that many of them have done drugs. I have no doubt that many of them exhibit their worst symptoms while high on drugs. I have no doubt that many of them had the illness prior to using the drug for the first time. Paranoia is a side effect that is experienced by some who smoke pot, but you only stay high for about an average of 2 hours after smoking pot. If someone experiences lasting paranoia or anxiety, i would suggest that there is an underlying psychological element that needs to be dealt with.",

   "But then again addiction is a classified mental health disorder listed in the DSM IV. ;)\n\n \n Sundowner: You are correct on this and your previous post. Addiction and underlying mental illness are often inseparable in determination. Often program eligibility for mental illness programs requires the person to remain drug free for a period as most of these programs exclude participation based solely on drug addiction (there are other programs for those with drug addiction). Often times it is not possible to tell if the symptoms being experienced are causing the drug use or the drug use is causing the symptoms. This I freely admit and agree with.\n \n However, Marijuana has a known behavioral affect. It causes calming. As you stated there are some benefit. All of them under prescribed conditions. Marijuana tolerence is also clearly demonstrated. Basically it takes more drug to get the same effect as a person continues use. If that drug (Marijuana) is removed it produces withdrawls. This is predictable in particularly heavy users. Less so but still significant in frequent but occasional users. This withdrawl is manifest as panic or anxiety. At some point the anxiety remains. This is also predictable.\n \n In some cases the underlying anxiety disorder first manifested and the person self medicated with Pot. In some cases the opposite happened. The only way to determine it is statistically. however, that does not work well as the statistics are corrupted by the type of sample. \n \n So, I cannot prove my point. I have only my experience. I am for anything that will help eliminate drugs in our schools including searches of lockers after hours. Students should enjoy some rights but the right to safety should come first given that they are minors and the schools have the position of \"En Loco Parentis\" or in place of the parents.",

We would all be quick to point out that a child with a troubled home life will be adversely affected in school. Using pot at a young age is frequently a sign of a troubled home life. This causes those students to require more attention. I am all for giving it to them. However, then we get into a fairness issue in that say, my child, goes to school doesn't do drugs and doesn't get the teacher's attention because there are student there who need much more due to drug use at home and neglect of their homework and their life in general.\n \n I think we mostly agree on this subject. I would encourage you to look at all view points. Consider it from the viewpoint of a parent who has a good student, from a parent with a drug using student, from a parent who doesn't care, from a parent who is more involved than the child.

My biggest problem with randomly testing students for drugs is that if it were done in my high school while I was a junior or senior, probably over half my class would have been suspended. I see recreational drug experimentation as a part of growing up. I know many people who have done so, and most have gone on to college, good jobs, military and government careers, medicine, some even become pilots! emoticon_xbye I feel that testing many of these kids is going to cause them more harm than good. The kids with true problems will be obvious, and it is these kids we should focus our efforts on.\n\n \n I think we agree on most things except for the bottom line. So let me throw more info. Nearly all companies now drug test randomly. It would be a useful exercise as we prepare our high school and college students for the world of work.",

The only thing I can even mention is that a lot of the companies out there drug test only on probable cause or after an accident. A lot also do just randomly drug test, usually jobs in transportation, medicine (with the exception of most doctors, quite a few who would not pass anyway...drug abuse among doctors is much more common than most think), and public safety type jobs. But you do make a very good point. emoticon_xgood",

   "Alright, first of all I'd like to say that I am an intelligent high school student, about to turn 16, and my public school is preparing to advocate random drug testing. Consequently, I am an avid pot smoker, yet well informed on the subject. \n \n I'd like to express my feelings on this contoversial topic since, it seems that this thread is now focused on marijuana use in schools and its really all im concerned about, although I will comment on other drugs as well.\n \n As far as marijuana goes, it is harmless, period. Nobody has ever died, ever, from smoking too much. 90% of the kids that would fail a drug test at my school would fail only due to marijuana. Marijuana is very common and socially acceptable, I believe the laws are severly unjust. It poses very few health risks, the main being \"lung cancer\". Let me tell you, a devoted tobacco smoker might die an early age after smoking a pack a day since they were 16, recent propaganda (yes propaganda, here in America, funded by the government, what do you know...) has tried to turn that on marijuana use. Alright, I can see where theyre coming from, I mean a joint does contain more tar than a ciagarette, but who can say that they've had the time and money to smoke 20 joints in a day?. Another clever fact seen on a commercial was: \"Marijuana has become 3 times as potent as it was in the 60's.\" Yea, im sure it has, but that just means we'll smoke less to get high and \n indefinitely reduce the risk of lung cancer :), which, btw, nobody has ever been diagnosed with lung cancer solely due to marijuana inhalation.\n \n Now, to get on topic, I believe a students rights are breached, without question when random or school wide drug testing is performed. Let me comment on this, being \"high\" in itself is not a crime, the law itself is broken when you are in \"possesion\". However, in order to attend a public school, a code of conduct must be signed. In which, using any controlled substance is forbidden and in the end that's how students are punished when tested positive. Currently, my school only tests students enrolled in extracuriicular activities and I think that is fair, in order to be in a sport or other activity you must sign a participation pledge, which pretty much says: \"You can test me any time.\" If you agree to it, than fine. I didnt agree to any test, yet my life is liable to be ruined for a stupid cause. The system is rediculous, school drug testing has failed pathetically in the past as well: \n \n http://www.erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?ID=6102 (See NY Times article and others on right column)\n \n It's a joke and i don't regret having ever taken my first hit, I know I will be \"successful\" in life regardless of if i toked up in high school. In fact, as odd as it may seem, I can attribute much of my success thus far to smoking marijuana, in fact before i study, I'll toke, before school on a test day, I'll toke. I am focused on school, I come to learn, I never bring anything on campus and therefore do not put myself in any risky positions. Dogs are periodically dropped in classes and I've never had a problem with them.\n \n I don't see what the police could possibly do in the event that a student tests positive for marijuana...I mean, seriously, hypothetically...\n \n A is a good student, enjoys a joint on the weekends. A never brings any drugs of any kind to school and smokes responsibly. A's school has agreed on random testing and unluckily, he is chosen. A proceeds to the nurses office or wherever, he fails the test. Epaphras_faith\n reccomended turning them into the police. Do you honestly think the police have enough time to worry about a high school kid who has THC in his system? Is A a drag on society? What is this going to accomplish? What would you reccomend as a punishment? Jail time?Rehab for marijuana, that's a joke, you'd realize it's a joke when you get to rehab, look around and notice the other attendents are having heroine related withdrawl seizures. If I were A, I would still stand strong on my opinion and load a bowl the day I got out.\n \n As far as other drugs go, somebody mentioned steroids and competition. Again, if you give your consent to be tested, are tested, and fail, than good luck. I think that people should entertain good judgement before they put any substance into their body. KNOW YOUR BODY, KNOW YOUR MIND.\n \n \n Anyway, thats all for now, peace,\n \n Ninj",

   "As far as marijuana goes, it is harmless, period.\n \n \n Not true. Look at your post, you even go on to list the fact that it contains more tar than a cigarette, and elude to the fact that it contributes to lung CA. Marijuana can also have other dangerous effects, especially on the cardiac and respiratory systems, however these are very rare. \n \n \nMarijuana is very common and socially acceptable, I believe the laws are severly unjust.\n \n \n I too find the laws to be unjust, but to say that marijuana is socially acceptable is stretching a little. Marijuana is socially acceptable to people who use it, but many others see it as completely unacceptable.\n \n \nLet me tell you, a devoted tobacco smoker might die an early age after smoking a pack a day since they were 16, recent propaganda (yes propaganda, here in America, funded by the government, what do you know...) has tried to turn that on marijuana use.\n \n \n I hope you realize that this so called \"propaganda\" has been validated in countries all over the world, and is now accepted as truth world wide. Marijuana is pound for pound about 3 times more harmful than cigarettes. Now true, you don't usually smoke more than a few joints, but they are more harmful than the same amount of cigarettes. Also, many people who smoke marijuana also use tobacco, which increases their risks of lung CA and cardiac complications exponentially. \n \n \nAnother clever fact seen on a commercial was: \"Marijuana has become 3 times as potent as it was in the 60's.\" \n \n \n I would have to wonder the validity of this. \n \n \nNow, to get on topic, I believe a students rights are breached, without question when random or school wide drug testing is performed. \n \n \n Sorry to inform you, but until you are 18 years old in this country, you are not granted full protection of your rights under the constitution of the united states. I don't agree with testing either, but saying that it violates your rights is not a valid argument. \n \n \nLet me comment on this, being \"high\" in itself is not a crime, the law itself is broken when you are in \"possesion\".\n \n \n Do you know that residue can be considered possesion? Did you know that it has been argued, with success I am sorry to say, that being high your body \"posseses\" THC, and therefore you are violating possesion laws? This sucks, I agree, but it can happen. And it can be proven post fact that you did at one time posses marijuana if you are high...be careful, laws are trickey that way. \n \n \nI don't see what the police could possibly do in the event that a student tests positive for marijuana...I mean, seriously, hypothetically...\n \n \n Technically, very little, other than search the student, his home, and his property. The worry is not the cops, the worry is what the school does. More and more schools are adopting zero tolerance policies for drugs, and right or wrong, are booting students for violations. Pot is not that big of a deal, especially when it comes to damaging someone's future, but if you are going to continue to do it with knowledge of the consequences, then you accept the risks. If you do it without knowledge of the consequences, then you are an idiot.",

   "Cannabis is blamed as cause of man's death\n By Richard Savill\n (Filed: 20/01/2004) \n \n \n A man of 36 is believed to have become the first person in Britain to die directly from cannabis poisoning.\n \n Lee Maisey smoked six cannabis cigarettes a day for 11 years, an inquest heard. His death, which was registered as having been caused by cannabis toxicity, led to new warnings about the drug, which is due to be reclassified this month as a less dangerous one.\n \n \"This type of death is extremely rare,\" Prof John Henry, a toxicologist at Imperial College, London, said after the inquest at Haverfordwest, west Wales.\n \n \"I have not seen anything like this before. It corrects the argument that cannabis cannot kill anybody.\"\n \n The inquest heard that Mr Maisey had complained of a headache on Aug 22 last year. Next morning he was found dead at the house he shared with a friend, Jeffrey Saunders, in Summerhill, Pembrokeshire.\n \n Michael Howells, the Pembrokeshire coroner, said Mr Maisey was free from disease and had not drunk alcohol for at least 48 hours. Post-mortem tests showed a high level of cannabinoids in his blood.\n \n He recorded a verdict of death by misadventure because Mr Maisey had died while taking part in an illegal activity. The death led to a warning about the changing strength of cannabis, which is to be reduced to a Class C drug on Jan 29.\n \n Dr Philip Guy, a lecturer in addictions at the University of Hull, said: \"Cannabis is not the nice hippy drug it used to be. It has been experimented with to produce stronger varieties.\"\n \n Dr Guy said that death was more likely if users ate the drug rather than smoked it. \"I would not be surprised if in this case the deceased had ingested a fatal amount of cannabis.\"\n \n Last autumn police issued a warning that big consignments of strong cannabis were being smuggled in from Africa. On Jan 29, cannabis will be reclassified from a class B to a class C drug.\n \n The shadow home secretary, David Davis, said last night: \"This highlights what we have been saying about the effects of cannabis all along. When will people wake up to the fact that cannabis can be a harmful drug?\n \n \"By reclassifying the drug David Blunkett has shown he has lost the war on drugs. In my eyes, it's nothing more than an admission of failure.\"\n \n Tristan Millington-Drake, the chief executive of the Chemical Dependency Centre, a charity that provides treatment for people with drug problems, said: \"We have always taken the view that cannabis is an addictive drug, unlike the pedlars who try to persuade us that it is harmless. The Government's decision to reclassify cannabis is a mistake.\"\n \n 19 January 2004: \u00a31m campaign to explain drug laws \n \n \n Previous story: Review to put trains 'back on track'\n Next story: Small pearl takes on the Bafta blockbusters\n \n \n Don't let anyone tell you that Pot is harmless.",

Think about it, instead of smoking 3 joints (of shwag) to get a little high, you can literally take three or four hits and be stickety stoned. Thats all you need. You don't have to tear your lungs up with joint after joint, a couple hits will do you fine. You'll notice the cancer causing agents don't increase with more potent weed.

Reform School???\n That's awful. It was a 5 to 4 decision and the \"Liberal\" Ginsberg, made sure it was limited to extra-curricular students only. Amazing, what kind of a XXXX Supreme court the Republicans put over us.\n \n It's really more a commentary on the Supreme Ct. and how lousy it is, as opposed to anything else. I am truely shocked. I would NEVER have believed in unless I had read it myself. \n \n Someday, when a good Supreme Court is in place, I believe this will be undone by the ACLU.\n \n I am stunned.",

   "FYI\n \n Workplace Overview\n Considering the general prevalence of alcohol and other drug use in the general Canadian population, it is not surprising that substance use problems are a leading cause of performance problems or impairment on the job (along with stress, fatigue and illness). Alcohol and other drug use can impact the workplace in several ways:\n \n acute intoxication by a psychoactive substance can affect a worker's judgment, alertness, perception, motor coordination, and emotional state. Drug impairment may not be obvious with simple tasks, but as the psycho-motor demand of a task increases, it generally takes less of most drugs for impairment to occur; \n the abuse of substances will, in many cases, result in hangover or withdrawal effects-as the drug is leaving the body-that can impact workplace performance even if the substance was used during non-work time; \n longer-term, heavy use can lead to chronic or dependent use that results in ongoing performance and health problems.\n Alcohol, medications such as benzodiazepines, sleeping pills and painkillers, and cannabis appear to be the substances of greatest concern in the workplace, due to the prevalence of their use and their effect on psychomotor tasks. While hallucinogens such as LSD clearly have a negative effect on performance, few adult Canadians use them. Tobacco withdrawal has been shown to decrease cognitive functioning.\n \n The most recent survey on workplace substance abuse was conducted in Alberta. It found that the most frequently reported impacts of substance abuse incidents by employers and union representatives were: missing a day of work or arriving late for work due to alcohol/drug use, work pace was slowed, made a lot of mistakes, dismissal, or someone was sent home due to impairment or hangover. The Alberta study estimated the hours lost and financial cost of missed days ($21 million/1.1 million hours) or lost productivity (working at less than 50% capacity - $46 million and 2.4 million hours) due to alcohol and drug use in the province.\n \n Trend data is available for Ontario only, but is useful in examining possible trends in the rest of the country. The most recent (2001) survey of Ontario adults found there have been no significant downward trends in substance use. Approximately 80% of adults are current drinkers (consistent with the Alberta findings) and a greater percentage of men are daily and heavy drinkers than women. Twice as many men than women are current marijuana users, with highest use levels in the age group 18 to 39.\n \n While the evidence is not readily available, it is generally agreed that substance abuse has a number of other impacts in the workplace, including general job performance (e.g., lower quality products, redone work), job turn-over (e.g., loss of experienced employees/corporate memory, severance, recruitment and orientation costs), legal liabilities associated with accidents and injuries, increased sick leave or other employee health benefit costs, disruptive behaviour and declining work relationships, pilfering and vandalism, and grievances and arbitrations.\n \n Substance use and abuse occur in virtually all populations and sectors; however, studies have shown that males, youth, and workers in particular sectors or occupations (e.g., construction, materials handling, transport, food and beverage, sales, seafaring, brewery, journalism, domestic work, mining, small business and armed forces) to be more associated with workplace substance abuse. Workers in the construction, utilities, forestry/mining, wholesale/retail trade, public administration and finance/insurance/real estate sectors were most likely to report substance use at work, at-risk use, and multiple substance use. At risk industries tend to have higher concentrations of young males 18 to 24 years of age, the demographic group most at risk for substance use. The Alberta researchers reported the safety-sensitive nature of many at-risk industries heightens concerns that substance abuse or use while at work may have serious implications for job performance and safety.\n \n Aside from the obvious health, safety and productivity concerns, other factors prompting companies to address substance abuse include government legislation (e.g., Canada Labour Code and provincial health and safety legislation, U.S. requirements for Canadian cross-border truck and bus drivers and rail operations), liability concerns where alcohol or other drug use may have contributed to an accident, contractor requirements (e.g., many Canadian companies require contractors to have a substance abuse policy), and the desire to achieve high quality and ethical standards. Some see substance abuse as a \"red flag\" for organizational or work design problems.\n \n In addressing substance abuse in the workplace, employers are advised to try to reconcile their need to demonstrate due diligence in creating a safe workplace with the need to respect employee rights. The measures they take should be aimed at achieving a balance between preventing problems before they arise (health promotion) and addressing problems once they do arise (health recovery), and between clearly stated expectations with sanctions and a supportive environment that values employee health and safety.\n \n Sources\n \n Alcohol and drugs in the workplace\n Butler, Barbara\n Toronto, ON: Butterworths, 1993.\n \n The effects of psychoactive substances on workplace performance\n Coambs, Robert B.; McAndrews, Mary P.\n IN: Macdonald, Scott; Roman, Paul (eds.)

   "Back again after more research. Lets touch on the violence topic for a bit. And lets look simply at marijuana. For the other drugs it would be much easier to show the link with violent behavior.\n \n The one thing that most legalize pot proponents maintain is that when smoking pot, people are more mello. That would be fine if it was the only effect on a person. It is not. \n \n Smoking pot has been shown to impair memory, learning of: academics, coordination, and social skills. Those who continue to use pot as they get older wind up piling deficit on deficit. Their skills never increase or worse, decrease. This lack of learning is what leads to violent behavior.\n \n Here are a couple of links on Marijuana:\n \n Early pot use and later functioning \n \n summary effects of marijuana \n \n The first shows that the earlier and more continued use of pot the less that a person is likely to earn in adult life. The second is about the standard accepted effects of pot on an individual.

There are probably many ways that teachers could be \"impaired\". What You fail to understand is that drugs are a bigger issue then sleep loss. Drugs are what we are concerned about in this issue. If you want to go ahead and start a debate about \"sleep requirements\" then create another thread. I am not saying that a drug test will destroy all saftey issues for children. I do not disagree that drugs aren't the only reason for a saftey issue, impairment etc. \n \n I do not disagree that sleep could impair. However sleep isnt Illegal. Sleep is just an emotional factor that acts on everyone many times. And no, you havent proved that sleep can cause effects just as bad as drugs. Reread effects of the drugs posted. Drugs are much more of a hazard then sleep loss. Drugs impair everyone, no? However, with sleep, it effects everyone differently. There are much too many variables in your argument here. Drugs will affect anyone with use, however with sleep, it depends on the person. \n \n Doing drugs (illegal) is breaking the law.
