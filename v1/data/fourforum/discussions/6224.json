   "And the ongoing dialogue concerning evolution:\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/20/national/20beliefs.html\n \n August 20, 2005\n A Catholic Professor on Evolution and Theology: To Understand One, It Helps to Understand the Other\n By PETER STEINFELS\n John F. Haught is a Roman Catholic theologian who, in a long series of learned, eloquent books and essays, has explored the religious significance of the contemporary understanding of evolution. \n \n On July 7, Professor Haught was dismayed to find in The New York Times an Op-Ed article by Cardinal Christoph Sch\u00f6nborn of Vienna flatly declaring this understanding to be false, followed two days later by a front-page article suggesting that the cardinal's stance might signal that the apparent peace treaty between Catholicism and evolutionary theory was about to be renounced. \n \n Professor Haught, a professor of theology at Georgetown University, was by no means alone. Sir Martin Rees, a leading British astrophysicist, expressed hope that the Pontifical Academy of Science, to which he belongs, would dissociate itself from Cardinal Sch\u00f6nborn's sentiments. The Aug. 6 issue of The Tablet, an international Catholic weekly published in London, carried an article by the Rev. George Coyne, a Jesuit priest and director of the Vatican Observatory, rebutting the cardinal's view. Numerous scientists and nonscientists, Catholics and non-Catholics, raised similar protests. \n \n \"Does Sch\u00f6nborn's essay mean that the church has changed its position on evolution?\" Professor Haught asks in the current issue of Commonweal. \"In a word, no.\" Nonetheless, he says, \"it is a setback in the dialogue of religion and science.\" \n \n \"Today most Catholic theologians and philosophers agree that it is not the job of science to make any reference to God, purpose, or intelligent design,\" Professor Haught insists. \"If some scientists go on to maintain that evolution is therefore conclusive evidence of a godless, purposeless universe, this is a leap into ideology, not a scientifically verifiable truth.\" \n \n Cardinal Sch\u00f6nborn \"has every reason to defend Catholicism against materialist philosophy, since these are indeed incompatible,\" Professor Haught continues. But when the cardinal \"fails to distinguish neo-Darwinian biology from the materialist spin that many scientists and philosophers place on evolutionary discoveries,\" he \"does no service to the nuances of Catholic thought.\"\n \n And to claim, Professor Haught adds, that science itself can demonstrate divine design is only to fall into a mirror version of \"the same conceptual mix-up.\" \n \n Professor Haught is far from suggesting, however, that biology is biology, theology is theology and never the twain shall meet. Although he believes that evolutionary theory cannot make ultimate claims about God or cosmic purpose without slipping into a metaphysics beyond its competence, he also believes that it raises a host of questions that theology must address. \n \n (Continued)",

   "\"Evolutionary science has changed our understanding of the world dramatically,\" he wrote in \"God After Darwin\" (Westview, 2000), \"and so any sense we may have of a God who creates and cares for this world must take into account what Darwin and his followers have told us about it.\" \n \n The role of chance events combined with the ruthless pruning by natural selection over vast, almost unimaginable expanses of time gives a picture of \"life's long journey,\" he has written, as \"a wide trail of loss and pain\" that cannot be easily reconciled with any traditional notion of a divine providential intelligence. In Professor Haught's view, arguments for intelligent design, even apart from their scientific weaknesses, do no theological justice to this tragic dimension of evolution. \n \n The fact that Tennyson's lines contrasting God's love with \"Nature, red in tooth and claw\" predated Darwin's theory is a reminder that natural selection, in one sense, only poses the perennial theological problem of suffering, just as do yesterday's innocent victims of war, famine or drunken drivers. But evolution amplifies that problem on the scale of eons. \n \n Professor Haught maintains that theology should engage this daunting challenge rather than try to escape it. More than that, as a Christian theologian, he argues that evolutionary theory is actually a gift to theology, prodding it to enlarge its understanding of God and returning it, in many ways, to the faith and implicit metaphysics of the Bible. \n \n For him, this conversation between religion and evolutionary theory is a two-way street. A theological perspective, he believes, clarifies the directionality one finds in evolution's story of \"life's long journey,\" from simple to complex, from the inanimate to living and finally self-conscious creatures. \n \n Theology can enlarge evolution's story to make better sense of \"the emergence of the most obvious experience any of us has, namely, the sense of our own selves as experiencing subjects.\" Much evolutionary theory, for legitimate methodological reasons or less legitimate metaphysical commitments, either ignores human subjectivity, a looming fact of nature, or explains it away as a kind of \"pure fluke\" in an essentially mindless universe. \n \n Professor Haught's case rests on what he calls a \"metaphysics of the future,\" rethinking God and nature in terms of futurity and promise. He leans heavily on thinkers like Alfred North Whitehead and Michael Polanyi and on Jewish Kabbalahistic and Christian thought about divine restraint or \"kenosis,\" self-emptying. Obviously, his approach will not convince everyone or answer every question, but readers, at least those not committed to the modern, literal reading of Genesis, will find him as direct in embracing traditional Christian tenets as in accepting the science of evolution. \n \n His \"God After Darwin\" was followed by \"Deeper than Darwin\" (Westview, 2003). \"My latest synthesis,\" he said last month, can be found in the 2004 Boyle Lecture, which is online at www.stmarylebow.co.uk/news/boyle2004.htm. \n \n Of course, Cardinal Sch\u00f6nborn's Op-Ed article has been superseded in public attention by the remarks of President Bush about discussing intelligent design in classes on evolution. Those interested in politics may pay more attention to the president's intervention, while those interested in theology may pay more attention to the cardinal's. But those interested in really exploring the implications of evolutionary theory for religious belief and of religious belief for evolutionary theory might read Professor Haught.",

   "Of the Issue:\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/20/politics/20frist.html\n \n August 20, 2005\n Frist Urges 2 Teachings on Life Origin\n By DAVID STOUT\n WASHINGTON, Aug. 19 - Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the Republican leader, aligned himself with President Bush on Friday when he said that the theory of intelligent design as well as evolution should be taught in public schools.\n \n Such an approach \"doesn't force any particular theory on anyone,\" Mr. Frist said in Nashville, according to The Associated Press. \"I think in a pluralistic society that is the fairest way to go about education and training people for the future.\" A Washington spokesman for the senator, Nick Smith, said later that the report was accurate.\n \n The theory of intelligent design holds that life is too complicated to have developed through evolution and that a higher power must be involved. Critics say intelligent design theorists are trying to supplant science with religious beliefs. \n \n The senator's view, expressed after his speech at a Rotary Club meeting, echoed President Bush's remarks of Aug. 2, when he told Texas newspaper reporters that he favored teaching both evolution and intelligent design \"so people can understand what the debate is about.\"\n \n Mr. Frist's agreement with President Bush on one of the more contentious educational, social and political issues of the time comes just a few weeks after he broke with Mr. Bush and with Christian conservatives on embryonic stem cell research.\n \n The senator said on July 29 that he supported a bill to expand federal financing for stem cell research, and that President Bush's four-year-old policy of strictly limiting taxpayer financing \"should be modified.\" The bill has been approved by the House but has been stalled in the Senate.\n \n Mr. Frist is widely assumed to be contemplating a run for the presidency in 2008, so his statements on issues that touch on moral as well as political questions are sure to be scrutinized both by Christian conservatives essential to a Republican candidacy and by people looking for signals that Mr. Frist is willing to move toward the center.\n \n Human embryonic stem cells can grow into any type of body tissue, so scientists and doctors see a potential use in treating a wide variety of diseases and injuries. But the cells cannot be obtained without destroying the embryos, which some people say is tantamount to murder.",
