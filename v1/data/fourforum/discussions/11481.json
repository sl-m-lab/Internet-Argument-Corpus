   "http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26143098/\n \n Bush wants to \"relax\" the EPA. Instead of having independant scientists evaluate what impact a project might have on endangered species, Bush wants to have whichever agency is running the project to make that determination. In other words, the people for who the top priority is to get the job in on time and under budget will be the ones who figure out if they need to reroute a highway because it'll go through a nesting site.\n \n How can Bush do this? I don't mean morally or intellectually, I mean legally. The EPA is a law, and last I checked the president can't just rewrite laws at will. But the article seems to say that Bush can change the rules without approval from Congress. How does that work? Where are the checks and balances that are supposed to help us keep the president from selling out to developers?",
