However, in the recent times, the last 100 years, several catastrophic consequences of our actions made us realise that the whole thing has to change. Concepts like human rights, principle of peace, control over those in power and similar are recent concepts.\n \n Both the US and the EU, along with several other highly developped countries, have made significant progress. Torture is prohibited, more or less control is exercised over the governments and so on. But this is recent, after all, collonialism disappeared only relatively recently, as you point out with Algeria. The eastern Europe had its share of cruelty under the autocratic (to you communist) regimes, the US had Communist witch hunts and racial segregation. Minorities are always in some sort of trouble. However, you will notice something: all these are generally condemned, and I firmly believe a repetition of these would face overwhelming opposition, public outcry and similar. We don't let these things become policy any more. \n \n Exceptions do happen. Police are faced with violence, and must respond, and sometimes go too far.

   "Alan,\n \n If we accept the Geneva Convention's definition of torture, I hope it doesn't mean I must argue in defense of all aspects of its use. I'm not willing to go that far. How about we agree to the bolded part.\n \n In other words, I'm not about to advocate torturing a person for an act he has committed.\n \n \"For the purposes of this Convention, torture means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions. \"\n \n As for the resolution, I'm hoping a simple statement will work.\n \n \"The use of torture should be a tool used in the war on terrorism.\"\n \n Any thoughts or suggestions?",

   "I seriously doubt that since most European antions have at some point faced terrorism. They did not resort to secret, offshore prisons.\n \n To me, this is indicative of the cowardice of the AMerican people. Many americans, apparently yourself included, are so terrified of the threat of terrorism that they are willing to support ANY measure in an attempt to mitigate that threat. Pathetic.\n\n I myself would be willing to torture a terrorist if it meant true mitigation of a further threat of terrorism. I would do this not out of fear, but to save lives. If I knew that pulling out the fingernails of one known terrorist with vital information would prevent a future attack which has the potential to kill thousands, then so be it. Of course, I do not condone random and useless torture that is less likely to provide any more information that Al-jezabel can tell us. I think there is a huge difference, but the line is often not too clear. Just a thought.",

   "I think CIA is constantly keeping an eye on Germany as a clue EU country. And CIA is not just staying idle. It's employing mass media outlets and NGOs on it's payroll in Germany to benefit Bush's interests in Europe.\n I think Gerhard Schroeder was forced out of power. And CIA supervised newspapers were definitely involved. Say Merkische Oderzeitung which did her best to damage Shcroeder image through unflattering leakage from his family life and so on. Westdeutsche Zeitung and Allgemeine Zeitung were also involved in the wide-scaled public campaign to downgrade the Chancellor. This was done on CIA money. \n Well... those so called orange revolutions are destined not for Eastern Europe only, Ukraine and her sort. I heard that CIA agents threatened Schroeder with a possible death in a car accident or so ....if he didn't quit. So he did... to stay alive. \n And now I guess he's making another try to come back into political life. At least he braved Washington in his comments on American missile shield in Europe. He rightly rejected the idea as not quite sane. Americans pursue their own line relating their security not ours. And again there's much ado about it in newspapers. Americans are scary that Schroeder could be back!\n I wish Merkel did same thing for her cagey posture on the matter doesn't somehow match Germany key role in EU. She didn't. CIA guys must have warned her as well of possible discouraging aftermath if she didn't follow American lead.",
