   "Well...only to some\n The Issue is Jobs, Not Deficit Reduction | The Nation\n Congressman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., says: \"I strongly believe we should not be talking about deficit reduction.\"\n \n That does not mean that Nadler rejects fiscal responsibility, or that he does not believe in making wise choices to get budgets in balance. What it means is that he refuses to buy into the notion that deficit reduction is the only issues -- just as he refuses to buy into the notion that the only way to reduce the deficit is by following the Republican gameplan.\n \n Like Franklin Delano Roosevelt and other wise Democrats before him, Nadler believes that growing the economy by creating jobs is a far smarter approach than cutting needed programs.\n \n \"We should be talking about how to create more jobs even if the cost [is] a bigger deficit,\" Nader says of the Obama and the Democratic leadership in Congress. \"The deficit is a long-term problem, but we could have more spending for a year or two to get the economy up. If we had a 5 percent unemployment rate, that would by itself eliminate two-thirds of the deficit.\"\n\n This is classic \"Can't see the forest for the trees\" thinking. \n \n Mr. Nadler seems to think the primary goal of government, right now, is the \"create jobs\" and to do so we should spend more money. Well, in order to spend more money you either need to raise taxes, borrow money, or print money. Right now we are doing 2 and 3. Even if we raised taxes we would still borrow more money or print more money. The fed has been by far the biggest purchaser of treasuries including QE1 and QE2 (aka printing money). Unfortunately, creating money simply inflates the dollar which limits investment and thus no jobs. As for borrowing, China, the biggest international purchaser of our debt, has already indicated they want us to cool the spending jets. The largest private domestic investor in US treasuries, PIMCO sold all of its treasuries and their management is on the record saying the interest is not worth the risk. Of course raising the interest rate would only further seize up investment. \n \n Now that we settled where the money would come from it is important to figure out what you would do with it to generate jobs. One way would be to just create a bunch of government jobs. These jobs tend to not add to the growth of our nation and at some point you have to admit that too many government jobs is bad for the economy and country. Obviously 100% or 0% of people being paid for by the government is not sustainable. Somewhere in the middle is where you need to be. Furthermore, it would cost about half a trillion a year just to cut the unemployment in half assuming you give them a salary barely higher than the poverty rate (plus benefits for federal employees). \n \n I suppose you could say we should invest in infrastructure and things like that to \"stimulate\" the economy. While this is a good thing you are hoping what happens is people invest in the US economy to spur the growth. Sadly, the way you get that money is basically inflating the currency to the point where no one wants to invest in the US. \n \n In short, raising more money to \"stimulate\" the economy will hurt jobs in the short and long term. We've basically painted ourselves into a corner here where no matter what job creation is not going to happen until we make the painful steps to get our fiscal house in order.",

   "The problem is that deficit reduction through job growth and infrastructure improvement is a long term investment. If you look at things like the CCC, interstate highway program, etc... those are programs that have repaid their initial investment many times over. \n \n We dont have a couple of decades to wait for repayment on some kind of big, job creating infrastructure project. We have a serious cash flow problem. We cant afford to pay our overhead and our creditors are balking at extending us more credit. \n \n This an analogous to a company realizing they have a cash flow and credit problem and deciding that the thing to do is to build a new factory and launch a new product line to solve their problem.",

   "Yeah, investment in infrastructure is good for the economy but it's a normal function of government (and a lot of times state government) and not just something you do with things go south. \n \n Like most economic \"theories\", Keynesian is only right to a certain point.

Clearly taking on a little debt to ease a recession helps but there is obviously a point where it no longer improved the economy by hurts it. We hit that point a long time ago. Rather, we spent the money to a point where we can no longer borrow it. \n \n The other main arguments I heard today other than the link posted was \"well, Japan is worse at 200% GDP to debt ratio and they're still around\". Glad to see we wish to model our fiscal policies after a country who has been in recession for 20 years (this is an exaggeration..they have been flat on GDP growth since 1995). \n \n I could even get into more argument like the national security of a lower debt. If China wanted to take us over they could do so with little effort. Granted they won't do this but my point is we are so dependent on others it gives you no leverage when sh*t hits the fan.

For example, their debt to GDP ratio is like 225%, but their reserves are higher than their debt. Since they have one of the lowest bond rates in the world, they actually MAKE money on their \"debt\". Their entire deficit is nothing but a big carry trade. That is why their government is so quick to intercede if their currencies value gets out of whack...they need a relatively stable value to keep the carry going.\n \n In the mean time, their standard of living has gone through the roof, as have their foreign reserves, and their trade surplus. Frankly their lost decade is a myth.\n \n The infrastructure issue is the only one that really concerns me. We NEED infrastructure, and we need it badly. We have some serious challenges that we need to meet, and simply put we do not have the infrastructure in place to meet them. \n \n We need to take major austerity measures if we want to survive as a nation. We need to make major infrastructure improvements if we want to thrive as a nation. \n \n After looking at all sides of the issue, I am firmly of the opinion that what would be best is if we just default on our debt and watch things burn. This will obviously screw us completely, but in 10 or 20 years we should be able to get things back in line. I would not even be opposed to the idea of dissolving the nation and starting over (the likely result of a default anyway).\n \n At this point taking steps to salvage the situation is worse than a waste of time, pretty much everything we do is making the problem worse.",

Japan actually has a working capitalist system...one where BOTH sides of the system see benefit. As japanese companies have become more efficient and automation has increased productivity, companies have lowered prices in order to compete for domestic consumers...you know...like capitalism is supposed to work. You dont see articles in Japanese magazines talking about how scared mobile providers are about the prospect of a price war where they have to decrease prices to fight for consumers. Their companies just DO it. \n \n A large part of that is the fact that japanese companies tend to take a longer view than their US counterparts. The end of the quarter is virtually meaningless to most Japanese executives. They are more interested in where the company will be in 10 or 20 years. Here in the US, long term is the end of the next quarter. Our executives push for maximum profitability NOW and dont care if 5 years from now their policies will leave the company begging for a bailout, by then they will have their golden parachute firmly strapped on. \n \n \nAs for the rest of your post, I'm not so sure we are as screwed as you say we are.

Printing money and wildly claiming we should create jobs with them is the exact opposite of letting capitalism take its course.\n \n I say this because it is in no other countries best interest to see the USA become Somalia overnight.\n\n \n When it comes down to just the numbers it is doable. I say this with 100% sincerity and seriousness....put me in a room with Obamas cabinet, a good supply of bottled water, and the phone number for at least 4 good takeout places and we could solve the numbers side of this in 20 hours. \n \n It is not just the numbers, though, it is the politics that makes this an impossible problem to solve. The country is too divided...too partisan. You have people on BOTH sides of the isle who hold positions that make no sense AT ALL because it is what they perceive \"their side\" as believing. This is made worse by the fact that a large percentage of people on both sides of the isle honestly believe that the other side is out to willfully destroy the nation, if not outright kill us all. Let me say that again. THEY ACTUALLY BELIEVE THE OTHER SIDE IS OUT TO WILLFULLY KILL US ALL.\n \n Neither side is actually willing to make or even suggest REAL cuts because they would not be re-elected because Americans are used to the government being an entitlement machine. The cuts they offer are relatively small and are not designed to make any substantial headway, they are designed to stick it to the \"other side\" in ways that their base will support. \n \n If we could break away from the 2 party system we might actually be able to make some headway, but he dems and republicans have pretty much assured that their 2 party system is the only option we actually have. Not only have they rigged federal election rules to heavily favor the 2 party system, they have done it at the state level. The problem there is that they have to keep pandering to the insanely ignorant in their parties to keep getting re-elected. There was a poll a while back showing that over 80% of Americans were willing to pay more taxes to keep SS and medicare as they are. You would think that would be a simple thing for politicians to decide...it is what over 80% of the people want, so raise taxes and make reforms to the programs. BUT...the republicans need the tea baggers to maintain power, so instead they refuse to even consider a tax increase and put out Ryans idiotic plan to cut deficits. \n \n I simply cannot see any way the politics on this come together. The way things are now, we are going to end up in a situation where either our creditors stop lending to us, which will destroy us as a nation, or we are going to wind up in a hyper inflationary scenario, which will do the same. In both of those scenarios things go completely out of control and we are pretty much left with nothing. In either case we basically end up getting bled to death over several years until there is nothing left.\n \n IMO the FAR more attractive destiny is to take control of our future, default on our debt, and concentrate on rebuilding something new. In my experience it is almost ALWAYS better to be proactive than reactive. Currently our fiscal policy is all about reactive...putting thumbs in cracks instead of diverting the river and building a new levy.",

Their companies just DO it. \nI thought the point about not needing GDP to see how things are going was an interesting thought. It basically just stated you can look around you and see if things are good or not. That seems simplistic but it makes sense to me. If I see every business I like go under than I assume things are bad. If I see new construction and I have more stuff than I see things as good.

Look at how difficult it was to come to any kind of agreement to get the rest of this year funded, and basically they only managed to do it by deciding to make no actual cuts, but rather to play book keeping tricks. \n \n When was the last time you saw a bill that had bipartisan support? I can tell you....the trillion dollar bailout had bipartisan support. So did the trillion dollar economic stimulus (though with some republican holdouts). Other than those, bipartisan support is reserved for bills that spend massive amounts of money, cut taxes, or steal away what limited freedom we have left. \n \n I am deeply, deeply disappointed in the house republicans.
