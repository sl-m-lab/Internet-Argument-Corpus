I feel their moral dilema is self-caused. If they never intended on all the chilren they never should have taken the chance. Their needs to be a change in the procedure, even if it lessens the chances or takes longer.\n \n This is very close to crossing the line i will admit. But it is still accetpable for someone who is against abortion. \n \n kedreo,\n \n come up with some proof of your ridiculous claims or dont expect to be taken seriously.\n \n MACH\n \n i with you on the donating thing, its like insurance.
