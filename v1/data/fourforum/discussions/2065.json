In fact, I don't think I've ever seen a documentary evoke the sort of heated reaction that certain movies (e.g., \"The Passion of Christ\") do . So I say again, the idea that Wal-Mart is acting merely out of a desire to avoid \"offending\" their customers just doesn't wash.\n \n http://www.walmartwatch.com\n \n Todd Altman",

You NEVER want to do anything that could alienate your customers, especially in a retail business...\n \n Have they allowed pro-war docmentaries into their stores? Probably not.
