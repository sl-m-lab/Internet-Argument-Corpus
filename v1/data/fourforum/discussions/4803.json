If it is clear that a democracy is being pragmatic I don't have a problem with people defending democracies that have done this with the \"it was like the US helping Stalin\" defence. \n \n \n However it seems Western foreign policy in the last 50 years has often blew up in in our faces since we gave aid or turned a blind eye to all sorts of scum in the HOPE that they would prevent a HYPOTHETICAL communist/fundamentalist uprising. It just made us look like arseholes, which helps fundamentalists recruit people. It was obvious that the nazis were a incredibly severe,clear and present and danger there was nothing hypothetical about it. You also did not have to hope Stalin would put all his efforts into fighting Hitler, his own life was on the line.",

During the cold war, fundamentalists where encouraged and supported by the west in order to fight of pan-arabic socialism. Soem scholars even atribute the rise of modern fundamentalism in Egypt, and it`s spread through the middle east as a direct result of western attempts to curb soviet influence. Apparantly, it was really hard to combat soviet influence and communism with liberal leaders in arabic countries due to their culture. Instead, one had to look to Islam to create a realistic alternative...",

When this occurred in 1924, Stalin took over the reins and his authority pushed through the industrial 5 year plans and the collectivization of agriculture which were quintessential communist measures.\n \n The German invasion of Russia in 1941 initiated an ideological war in which Nazi fascism faced revolutionary communism under the command of its Red dictator and guardian - Joseph Stalin.

   "how did stalin actually apply Marxist Communism? \n \n Besides the communal farming...could you help me out here?\n\n \n I suspect what you might be suggesting here is that Stalin was not really committed to the ideology of Marxist-Leninism, but that he was an unscrupulous freelance tyrant who used Communist doctrines as a camouflage under which he manipulated his way to power ? Then having got to the summit in Soviet Russia, perhaps you think he affected a belief in Marxist principles in order to maintain himself as a despot ?\n \n There is something to be said for this view. Stalin, unlike Lenin, was not a political theorist and he contributed little if anything to \"Marxist thought\". But he certainly acted as if he wanted to reconcile every aspect of policy with Marxist-Leninist principles, even if he was only paying lip service to the ideas that were supposed to be at the core of his political philosophy. \n \n A few examples of his Leninist inheritance: (apart from the 5 year plans designed to secure production by force, and the drives towards collectivism).\n \n he effected complete control of all media for propaganda purposes.\n he systematically eliminated opposition without respect for law or morality.\n he demanded unswerving dogmatism in all matters, regardless of competence.\n he justified such measures as being necessary in achieving a \"workers state\" - on the road to that socialist utopia in which the dictatorship of the proletariat would be realized. \n \n It could be argued that his interpretation of Marxist-Leninism resulted in a new species of revolutionary politics called Stalinism - and that this \"novelty\" is an unavoidable consequence of the attempt to elucidate Marxist doctrine as a program of action rather than a theory of history.",
