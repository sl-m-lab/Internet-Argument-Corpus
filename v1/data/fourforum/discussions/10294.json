The site contains a posting of The Virgin Birth Doctrine by Jocelyn Rhys - Published in 1922.\n \n I would see your opinions of the information posted at: http://englishatheist.org/indexd.shtml \n \n Please, please don't discount the information simply because the author is an atheist! emoticon_xdonno Instead, either disprove or substantiate the information with facts that can be verified!\n \n No leaps of faith here...

Just made part of rituals like Easter. However, Easter is found in the King James translation of The Holy Bible (Acts Chapter 12 and verse 4). The name Easter was never used in the original text of scripture for the resurrection of Yeshua Ha'Mashiach (Jesus The Christ). While many today try to disassociate this celebration from it's pagan roots by referring to it as \"Resurrection Sunday\", does this celebration have any place amongst believers or any relevance to Messiah's resurrection?\n \n Origin of Easter - Nimrod, Semiramis (Easter), and Tammuz (the \"reborn\" Nimrod)\n \n \"Easter\", many scholars agree, has its root in ancient pagan religion. \"Easter\" derived from Eastre, the Anglo-Saxon goddess of spring. The name is actually much older - going back to Babel and it's infamous tower.\n \n The grandson of Noach (Noah), Nimrod, formed the first post-flood kingdom. Jewish tradition indicates that Nimrod was a tyrant \"who made all of the people rebellious against God.\" Nimrod ruled several major cities including Babel, Asshur, Nineveh and Calah (cities known through-out the ancient world for unimaginable perversion).\n \n When Nimrod died, the Babylonian mystery religion continued. His wife Semiramis deified him as the Sun-god. He is known through out pagan religions as Baal, Baalim, Bel, and Molech. Semiramis later gave birth to an illegitimate son named Tammuz (later known in the Roman world as Mithras) , was claimed to be Nimrod \"reborn.\" \n \n Furthermore she claimed that her son was supernaturally conceived and that he was the promised seed, the 'savior' - promised by God. Nimrod was deified as the god of the sun and father of creation. Semiramis became the goddess of the moon and fertility. \n \n In the Mystery cults, the 'savior' Tammuz \\ Mithras , was worshipped in spring with pagan rites. According to legend, after Tammuz was killed by a wild boar, he went into the underworld. But through the weeping of his mother (for 40 days - lent) he was resurrected. Each year a spring festival was held to dramatically represent this supposed 'resurrection'.\n \n Thus a false religion developed with sun and moon worship, priests, astrology, demonic worship, worship of stars associated with their gods, idolatry, mysterious rites, human sacrifice, and more. \n \n Lastly, how do you know the virgin birth was a factual event? Where you there? If not you are relying on a story (actually a combination of stories). The first one written at least 40 years after his death. I am 67 years old and I would be hard pressed to write to story of someone's life who I knew 40 years ago... with accuracy. Even worse if I were eighty years old, tried to recall the life of a person who I knew since he was born and attempted to recount everything about him..... As in the case of the bible. IMPOSSABLE. No tape recorders back then. \n \n Just as are stories passed down from person to person..... AND we all know what happens when stories get passed down... For example, \"You should have seen the 5 lb fish I caught!\" Every time the story gets told the fish gets bigger and bigger. emoticon_ic",
