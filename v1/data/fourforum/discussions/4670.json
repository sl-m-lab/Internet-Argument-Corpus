   "Count the number who voted aganist the terri shavio bill. That's the number of conservatives in Congress.\n\n \n Correct. Traditional conservatives have historically been against increasing the size and influence of federal government. For a politician to intervene in personal circumstances and state levels of justice proceedings while attempting to bring them to a level of federal jurisdiction, that ain't no conservative. \n \n Most of the political spouting was word for word by that of religious leaders, Shavio's parents being Catholic. Some posters here, claiming conservative views, said almost those same words. When it comes to politics or money, Christians are very flexible in their viewpoints and ideology.",

   "I agree.\n \n Also, I find the fact that Tom Delay himself was in a very similar situation at about the same time Terry Shiavo became brain damaged.\n \n This is the epitome of hypocrisy.\n \n Look at some of the details of Delay's father's death.\n (I also hope the whole world starts talking about Tom Delay's father, on and on, ad nauseum, relentlessly for weeks.)\n \n I know, it's the LA Times, sue me... :)\n \n http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-delay27mar27,0,5710023.story?coll=la-home-headlines\n \n \nMore than 16 years ago, far from the political passions that have defined the Schiavo controversy, the DeLay family endured its own wrenching end-of-life crisis. The man in a coma, kept alive by intravenous lines and oxygen equipment, was DeLay's father, Charles Ray DeLay.\n \n Then, freshly reelected to a third term in the House, the 41-year-old DeLay waited, all but helpless, for the verdict of doctors.\n\n \nAnd DeLay is among the strongest advocates of keeping the woman, who doctors say has been in a persistent vegetative state for 15 years, connected to her feeding tube. DeLay has denounced Schiavo's husband, as well as judges, for committing what he calls \"an act of barbarism\" in removing the tube.\n \n In 1988, however, there was no such fiery rhetoric as the congressman quietly joined the sad family consensus to let his father die.\n \n \"There was no point to even really talking about it,\" Maxine DeLay, the congressman's 81-year-old widowed mother, recalled in an interview last week. \"There was no way [Charles] wanted to live like that. Tom knew - we all knew - his father wouldn't have wanted to live that way.\"\n \n Doctors advised that he would \"basically be a vegetable,\" said the congressman's aunt, JoAnne DeLay.\n \n When his father's kidneys failed, the DeLay family decided against connecting him to a dialysis machine. \"Extraordinary measures to prolong life were not initiated,\" said his medical report, citing \"agreement with the family's wishes.\" His bedside chart carried the instruction: \"Do not resuscitate.\"\n\n \n What gets me is what Delays PR people say:\n \n \n\"The situation faced by the congressman's family was entirely different than Terri Schiavo's,\" said a spokesman for the majority leader, who declined requests for an interview.\n \n \"The only thing keeping her alive is the food and water we all need to survive. His father was on a ventilator and other machines to sustain him,\" said Dan Allen, DeLay's press aide.\n\n \n I'm sorry, but is the number of machines keeping you alive the deciding factor? \n \n One machine = keep 'em alive no matter what\n More than one machine = I wouldn't want to live like this.\n \n We all need to breathe oxygen to survive too.\n That's all Delay's father needed, just like anyone else.\n We all need to process waste through our kidneys to survive.\n That's all Delay's father needed, just like anyone else.\n \n So, according to Delay's logic, he should have kept his father alive until 2005, since that seems to be when he flip-flopped on his position that people in PVS deserve to die with dignity.\n \n It has nothing to do with what machine is keeping you alive. \n It has to do with being in a vegetative state. \n There are people who are not in a vegetative state that need machines to keep them alive, ask any dialysis patient.\n Diabetics need artificial insulin shots everyday to live.\n ALS patients sometimes need a feeding tube, but they are allowed to live!",

By choosing to ignore scientific proof of her vegetative state and circumvent local and state judiciary rulings, the parents and politicians who jumped on the bandwagon were basing their opinions on pro-life beliefs, or probably in the case of politicians grabbing what publicity was available. That's a cornerstone of Christianity, only their god can give or take life, and a key issue in equally muddied abortion rights. A big block of public votes.\n \n No. I've long accepted the stupidity and apathy of the general public and well established fact that politicians manipulate them with promises and deceit.",
