   "For those of you who don't know, the FOPA makes the BATFE stop accepting tax stamps for machineguns made after May 19, 1986. This means that civillians can only legally transfer and possess machineguns made before 1986 (only after going through extensive NFA procedures).\n \n I really don't understand the point of the FOPA. Since 1934 (enactment of NFA) there have been almost no crimes with legally owned machine guns. I have heard of only two crimes with legally owned machineguns. The last time a legally owned machinegun was used in a crime it was used by a police officer to commit a murder, as opposed to a civillian. Police departments can own machineguns made after 1986 and don't need a tax stamp.\n \n Civillians can still obtain machineguns, just as long as they weren't made within twenty years ago. This has driven the price of machineguns sky-high. Before '86, an M11 could be bought (aftere going through NFA procedures) for less than $1000. Now, the same M11 costs five times as much and you are unlikely to be able to find a new transferable machinegun.\n \n The NFA was one of the few gun laws that made sense. The NFA makes ownership of full-autos, short-barreled shotguns and rifles, pen-guns and the like, grenades, grenade launchers, mines, bombs, and artillery restrictive. If you have a clean record, you can get an NFA weapon...... if your state allows it.\n \n However, the point of the FOPA was to keep decent weapons out of the hands of the people. \n \n If the FOPA is repealed, crimes with legally owned machineguns will not increase. There is no evidence to suggest otherwise. The only thing that will happen is that prices on machineguns will be affordable.\n \n I'm interested to know what you anti-gunners think about the FOPA.",

   "FYI. Don't know if this will help the discussion or not, but here is the relevant portion of the federal code referred to in this thread. In addition to other things, the '86 FOPA created subsection (o) in the following existing firearm crimes statute:\n \n 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922 (o)\n \n (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), it shall be unlawful for any person to transfer or possess a machinegun.\n \n (2) This subsection does not apply with respect to -\n \n (A) a transfer to or by, or possession by or under the authority of, the United States or any department or agency thereof or a State, or a department, agency, or political subdivision thereof; or\n \n (B) any lawful transfer or lawful possession of a machinegun that was lawfully possessed before the date this subsection takes effect.\n \n More FYI. The definition of \"Machinegun\" is broader than some might think. It is found in the Internal Revenue Code, in a statute which defines several items including the term \"machinegun\":\n \n 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845 (b)\n \n The term \"machinegun\" means any weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger. The term shall also include the frame or receiver of any such weapon, any part designed and intended solely and exclusively, or combination of parts designed and intended, for use in converting a weapon into a machinegun, and any combination of parts from which a machinegun can be assembled if such parts are in the possession or under the control of a person.",

   "I think that the entire NFA is unconstitutional. \n \n I don't think thre is any question that military type weapons, including machine guns, are the articles primarily descibed in the second ammendment. Even the supreme court in the Miller decision went so far as to say that military weapons were primarily protected by the second ammendment, and since a sawed off shotgun was not, to the best of their knowledge, a weapn typically used in military service it was not protected.\n \n How is taxing the posession of military weapons, a right held by americans, any different from instituting a poll tax in order to vote? While the $200 tax today is not especially prohibitive, at the time that the law was instituted it was. I would be willing to bet you a nickle that if we instituted a $200 tax to vote, people would find it grossly unconstitutional.\n \n The problem is, what do we do about it? Do you want to be the sacrificial lamb to get arrested with a machine gun and spend millions fighting to get it to the supreme court? The odds of being arrested for posession of a machine gun and then being able to appeal through the court system without getting your appeal denied with a one line \"the right to bear arms is a collective right\" finding is pretty slim. So, we are pretty much screwed on that front.",

   "IIRC that case was dismissed.\n \n From a practical standpoint, it seems unlikely that fighting this out in the courts is goign to get us anywhere unless we can address the problem of federal courts essentially ignoring law in pursuit of policy results. \n \n I think the other problem is that neither side wants to see a second ammendment case in the supreme court. Every time inthe recent past we have had one up for review both sides have scrambled to file friend of the court briefs urging the court to not accept the case. Both sides are terrified of the outcome of such a case in the supreme court. While anybody of even marginal literacy SHOULD be able to comprehend the second ammendment and related literature, that does not seem to count for much anymore since there is such a precedent for treating the second ammendment using different standards than are applied to other constitutional principals.\n \n I don't knwo that I would want a second ammendment case heard by this particular supreme court. While Thomas seems to have some pretty strong views (which seem to add up to \"give me a second ammendment case and I will invalidate every gun law in the country\"), and Alito has actually written an opinion in the past stating that mere posession of a machine gun does not meet the burden of \"interstate commerce\".\n \n HOWEVER, the current supreme court had a chance to hear an NFA/interstate commerce case not long ago and they bunted. They vacated Stuart and sent it back to the ninth to reconsider in light of Raich. They bunted.\n \n Now, maybe Bryan can answer this for me. I know that in vacating the ruling of the 9th, that it essentially never happened and the 9th would have to issue a new ruling. First, do they actually have to issue a new ruling? Stuart is pretty much in jail for the rest of his life anyway, so from a prosecutorial standpoint pursuing the case would esssentially be a huge waste of time. Second, does the same panel of judges now reconsider the case? Finally, pending the new ruling on Stuart, could Stuart appeal the case on second ammendment grounds? \n \n Personally, I think the Raich ruling was complete and utter BS.",

   "Yes, the ninth circuit will have to re-decide the Stewart case. Stewart was a combined Commerce Clause and Second Amendment case. The ninth circuit upheld his conviction against the Second Amendment challenge and cited its Locklear decision for the position that Stewart did not have an individual Second Amendment RKBA. But Stewart had another grounds for appeal. Stewart added the commerce clause violation claim to his Second Amendment claim. He claimed that the statute he was prosecuted under (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922, cited above in my earlier post on this thread), could not be applied to homemade machine guns. The reason for this claim is this: when Congress passed this machine gun ban it had to claim the authority to do so came from its power to regulate interstate commerce. That is, commerce between \"foreign nations\" and \"among the several states\" as well as with Indian tribes. Stewart used raw material items obtained in interstate commerce to construct homemade machineguns, which remained thereafter in his possession and did not re-enter interstate commerce. The Ninth Circuit accepted this appeal argument and declared that applying the ban on possession to homemade weapons kept out of interstate commerce by the maker is an unconstitutional extension of Congress' interstate commerce regulatory power. The bottom line is that the ninth circuit said Stewart had no individual RKBA, but at the same time the statute banning his possession of the machineguns could not be used to prosecute him because it violated the interstate commerce clause. The Government appealed the commerce clause ruling (and this was the only issue presented to SCOTUS). SCOTUS remanded the case back without a decision. \n Now it is not uncommon for SCOTUS to have several cases appealed to it that deal with similar constitutional arguments, and there were other interstate commerce clause cases pending at the same time as Stewart. One of those (which also arose out of the ninth circuit) was Gonzales v. Raich (which was formerly called Ashcroft v. Raich). SCOTUS decided this case before it got to Stewart. Raich was the California medical marijuana case, where home growers challenged Congress' claim to be able to regulate home grown marijuana through the interstate commerce clause. The ninth circuit used the same logic it applied in Stewart to rule Congress cannot use its interstate commerce clause regulatory power to prohibit home grown marijuana that does not enter interstate commerce. SCOTUS overturned that decision and said Congress can regulate home grown marijuana through its interstate commerce power. Because the marijuana case applies the same constitutional law as that challenged in Stewart, SCOTUS then remanded Stewart back to the ninth circuit with a command that it re-decide that case similarly to the SCOTUS' opinion in Raich. To quote the remand by SCOUTS: \"This Court's decision in Raich is therefore likely to shed significant light on the proper disposition of respondent's as-applied constitutional challenge to 18 U.S.C. 922(o).\" When SCOTUS makes new law like this it is very common for it to kick all pending cases which have similar legal issues back to the Circuit courts with the not to subtle hint to re-decide the case and get with the program.\n \n The case will be re-decided in the ninth circuit by the same judges, except perhaps one of the ninth's original deciding judges may not rehear it because she was on temporary loan from another Court and may not be back when it is re-decided. I can't say if the ninth will take SCOTUS' hint and change its opinion, because the ninth has a history, particularly in criminal procedure cases, of ignoring SCOTUS (which irks the hell out of SCOTUS-the justices seem to delight in telling the ninth it is wrong in criminal constitutional law cases). As far as the commerce clause challenge goes I don't think it really matters. If the ninth sticks to its guns then the government will appeal to SCOTUS again and it would slap the ninth circuit down and rule that Congress can use the interstate commerce clause to ban the possession of home made machine guns (although Alito questioned this authority in a similar case, which led the Brady Campaign to label him \"machine gun Sammy\" during his confirmation hearings). \n \n I don't know enough about federal appellate procedure rules to know if the Second Amendment claim is preserved, because the only issue appealed to SCOTUS was the commerce clause challenge. Assuming that Stewart has not procedurally defaulted his Second Amendment claim, then if Stewart looses round two of the commerce clause fight he may be able to appeal the ninth's ruling on the Second Amendment question to SCOTUS as well.\n \n See the original ninth circuit decision in Stewart, which was appealed to SCOTUS, here: http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/circs/9th/0210318p.pdf\n \n See SCOTUS' decision in the similar interstate commerce clause test case of Gonzales v. Raich here: http://wid.ap.org/scotus/pdf/03-1454P.ZO.pdf\n \n See SCOTUS' opinion remanding Stewart back to the ninth circuit \"in light\" of Raich: http://www.usdoj.gov/osg/briefs/2004/2pet/7pet/2004-0617.pet.aa.html",

They consist of now of the whole people, except a few public officers. But I cannot say who will be the militia of the future day.\" -George Mason\n So I don't think the militia was meant to be some static organization that could never undergo any changes.

Id. Since the Miller decision, no federal court has found any individual's possession of a military weapon to be 'reasonably related to a well regulated militia.' 'Technical' membership in a state militia (e.g., membership in an 'unorganized' state militia) or membership in a non-governmental military organization is not sufficient to satisfy the 'reasonable relationship' test.

   "Stewart's attorneys will be allowed to argue that the circumstances of the marijuana in Raich are different from the gun in his case. I don't know how well that argument will be received by the Ninth Cir, but if the Ninth rules in his favor on that commerce clause question then it will end up back at SCOTUS, which seems ready to say Congress can use commerce clause power to regulate Stewart's machine guns.\n \n Let me turn to U.S. v. Miller for a moment. This is how that Court described the term \"militia\":\n \n \"The signification attributed to the term Militia appears from the debates in the Convention, the history and legislation of the Colonies and the States, and the writings of approved commentators. These show plainly enough that the militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. \"A body of citizens enrolled for military discipline.\" And further, that ordinarily when called for service these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of a kind in common use at the time.\" U.S. v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174, 179 (1939).\n \n (Note that one of the \"writings of approved commentators\" cited by the Court was former Justice Joseph Story's work in which he claimed that the right to keep and bear arms \"has justly been considered, as the palladium of the liberties of a republic.\" 3 J. Story, Commentaries \u00ba 1890, p. 746 (1833))\n \n This decision is often mischaracterized as supporting the view that the RKBA only protects the right of enrolled militia members to keep/bear their sanctioned militia arms. Yet Miller was not a member of any militia. He was a private citizen who got caught with a sawed-off shotgun while bootlegging. If SCOTUS wanted to decide that the RKBA protects only militia members, then it would have issued a very short opinion that said as much and would have dismissed the case on the grounds that Miller, because he was a private citizen and not an enrolled militia member, lacked standing to present a Second Amendment infringement claim.\n \n Regarding the shotgun Miller possessed, this is how SCOTUS decided that issue:\n \n \"In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a \"shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length\" at this time has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument. Certainly, it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.\" Id. at 178.\n \n Now evidence in cases like this is presented at the trial court level in the district court. In this case, Miller never presented any evidence for his 2nd. Amendment claim. Instead, an activist judge on his own ruled the NFA violated the 2nd. Amendment and invited an appeal. Miller absconded during the appeal process, and no one appeared to argue his case for him. The Court heard only from the government. The \"in the absence\" comment that starts SCOTUS' analysis is a clear swipe at the defendant's failure to present any evidence below or even have anyone argue his case for him.\n \n In the end, what Miller suggests is private citizens have a RKBA, and that the scope of the right is defined by whether the weapon is \"part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.\"",
