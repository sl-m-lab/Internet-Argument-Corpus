   "I walk along the windy beach\n Of the Moray Firth to teach\n My son of the first to dare\n Go from the water into the air.\n \n We can almost see them now.\n Lobefin fish struggle up somehow\n From surf to sand they creep\n On fleshy fins they leave the deep.\n \n The fleshy limbs grow one foot each\n To walk bravely away from the beach.\n They explore a world on sturdy legs.\n But in water they must still lay eggs.\n \n Then some lay eggs in hard shell\n Protecting their babies quite well\n So further inland they can explore\n Forests, plains, hills, and more.\n \n Warm little pioneers find a way\n To bear live young, no eggs to lay.\n Some climb the forest trees where\n Predators cannot harm hide nor hair.\n \n Fingers that grip also pick,\n Sharpen, and use a stick.\n This can poke the holes in wood\n To catch termites that taste good.\n \n Binocular vision and growing brain\n Lead some of them to explore again.\n Down from the trees onto the ground\n Tasting new foods there to be found.\n \n From the forest some venture out\n Onto plains where they will scout.\n Running on legs built for speed \n They evade the lion hoping to feed.\n \n They can carry their food by one arm\n And a club or stone to ward off harm\n Is carried firmly in the other hand\n To bash or hurl, defending the band.\n \n They explore Earth from sea to land\n Exploiting all habitats unable to stand\n The drastic changes all taking place;\n So they turn their eyes toward outer space.\n \n They now go forward to bravely explore \n Moon craters and Martian shore.\n Heroes may die in search for the light\n Of truth, wisdom, and insight.\n \n Wind over wave crests foaming,\n Bring my mind back from roaming\n To see a crab scamper up the shore.\n Perhaps it too will start to explore.\n \n Cuchulainn (Domhnall MacPherson\u00a9)",
