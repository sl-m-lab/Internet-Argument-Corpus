You explain the statistic very clearly, but what is your point?\n \n Do you imply guns cause crime?\n Do you prove guns cause crime?\n Do you prove guns increase crime?\n What are you trying to back up with that statistic?\n and how does it work?\n \n It is just a worthless statistic unless you give an analysis or extrapolate a logical conclusion from it. Please explain further.\n \n Remember root cause?\n \n Here is a statistic for you: more prisoners and felons come from broken families.\n \n Prisoners commit crime. Without the supervision from loving parents a criminal never learns to be a moral and ethical member of society as a child. Basically children from broken families do not learn right from wrong. Then become criminals. Help families stay together, help families raise good children, and you stop crime. Broken families are thus one of the root causes of crime. \n \n There is one way you can stop crime and without taking away guns. Do you remember the others? Yes do all those and you stop crime without taking away guns.\n \n What are you trying to say? Take the guns? Guns cause crime?",
