   "Leviticus 18:22-23 \n Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.\n Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto: it is confusion.\n \n Leviticus 20:13-16\n If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.\n And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you.\n And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast.\n And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.\n \n \n \n This says that homosexual intercourse is an abomination and a perversion -- \n a perversion as bad as bestiality or adultery!\n Let me see, child molesters are considered wrong in the USA \n but homosexuality is right?\n BTW Adultry = Child Molesters = Homosexuality = Bestiality!\n Why is that so many people today call that which is evil good, \n and that which is good evil, and can see no difference between the two?\n So who has blinded them to this false doctrine?\n \n As it is written\n In whom the god of this world \n hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, \n lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, \n who is the image of God, should shine unto them.\n \n Problem is that many of these people don't know the difference \n between \"the god of this world\" and GOD!\n And they profess to be Christians! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Jesus Christ taught us how to love!\n HAVE YOU LEARNED TO LOVE ENOUGH \n TO FIGHT AGAINST ALL OF OUR SINS\n THAT SENT HIM TO HIS DEATH?\n \n God Hates Homosexuality\n If you are looking, for the right to continue \n in that which is clearly called a perversion,\n then you have found the wrong site!\n Homosexuality is a SIN period!\n Not only that but it is unnatural\n The same as sex with an animal is unnatural!\n \n \n \n \n The Bible does not speak much of Homosexuality?\n It also doesn't speak of incest or bestiality much more neither?\n Guess you want to make them legal and not a sin also! \n \n \n \n \n What is worse then the sin of Homosexuality?\n Teaching people it's ok to do so.\n As it is written,\n But whoso shall cause one of these little ones that believe on me to stumble, \n it is profitable for him that a great millstone should be hanged about his neck, \n and that he should be sunk in the depth of the sea. \n The word homosexuality in the dictionairy states nothing about the person's age, just same sex! \n Anybody who is attracted to the same sex is a homosexual regardless of age differences. \n So a 20 year old man who molest a 14 year old boy is a Homosexual!\n \n \n \n \n What does Jesus teach in the New Testemant about sin?\n From John 8:3-11 paraphrased\n \n And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a man \n caught in the act of homosexuality \n and when they had set him in the midst,\n They say unto him, \"Master, this man was taken in homosexuality, \n in the very act, Now Moses in the law commanded us, \n that such should be stoned to death: but what sayest thou?\"\n This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. \n But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, \n as though he heard them not. So when they continued asking him, \n he lifted up himself, and said unto them, \n \"He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at him\".\n And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.\n And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, \n went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: \n and Jesus was left alone, and the man standing in the midst.\n When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the man, \n he said unto him, \"Man, where are those thine accusers? \n hath no man condemned thee\"?\n He said, \"No man, Lord.\" \n And Jesus said unto him, \n \"Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more!\" \n \n Where does Jesus say to continue in \n the sin of Adultry or Homosexuality?????\n \n Where does he say it's not a SIN?\n \n BTW Adultry = Child Molesters = Homosexuality = Bestiality!\n \n 2 Timothy 3:16 all scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: \n \n \n \n The thoughts and intents \n of your heart is the same as the sin!\n Matthew 5\n 27. Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: \n 28. But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart. \n \n Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit homosexuality: \n But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a man to lust after him \n hath committed an abomination with him already in his heart. \n \n Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit homosexuality: \n But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after \n her hath committed an abomination with her already in her heart. \n \n \n \n Does God say it's ok to Lust? \n Matthew 4 \n 1. Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. \n 2. And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred. \n The devil always attacks you when you are the weakest! \n Think about it, who does it say the temptor is? It's the devil! \n The Devil is the one putting the actual thoughts into the person's head in the first place to make them think they are a homosexual! \n \n James 1 \n 14. But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. \n 15. Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death. \n The temptor here is the devil also, it is the the devil who puts the thought into the man's head! \n The man is then drawn away by the thought which is put into his head which causes him to be enticed to own lust and desires! \n The thought that was put into the person's head is evil, you can stop it there and it is not a sin or lusting! \n So since Jesus Stopped it cold by using the Scripture of the Bible he never was enticed to commit sin! \n \n But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed which leads to sin. It's his own Lust that lets him be tempted in the first place but God tells us to abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul and that we should no longer live the rest of our lifes in the flesh to the lusts of it, but to the will of God. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. \n \n The Truth is if you \"lust\" then you are disobeying God \n because he tells you not to lust! \n So you are then \"missing the mark\" or \"sinning\"! \n Therefore to him \n that knoweth to do good, \n and doeth it not, \n to him it is sin. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Sometimes we get small thoughts into our heads, when we're reading the bible or just thinking to ourselves. Thoughts that aren't right, like lust, or that we COULD take a certain passage of scripture to mean something other than it says, so that it makes those thoughts we're having ok. This is the work of Satan. This is very wrong. If it's not of Christ, it is of Satan, and if it is of Satan than you need to get rid of that thought immediately. \n \n \n Professing Christians? \n Joe accepted a temptation from the devil, \n then Joe proclaimed \"I am a Homosexual\".\n Joe then says and beleives \n \"I have a homosexual orientation\". \n For with the heart man believeth unto un-righteousness; \n and with the mouth confession is made as a homosexual.\n \n or\n \n Bill accepted a temptation from the devil, \n then Bill proclaimed \"I am an atheist\".\n Bill then says and beleives \n \"There is no God\". \n For with the heart man believeth unto un-righteousness; \n and with the mouth confession is made as an atheist. \n \n Both have to reject the temptation they accepted \n before they are saved! \n \n Jesus Christ said you cannot serve 2 masters. \n In both of these cases the Devil is the person's master \n and it is the Devil whom he or she serves. \n Anybody can say \"I am a Christian\" \n but Jesus Christ says otherwise!\n \n For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; \n and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.\n \n You need to publicily denouce your homosexuality!\n \n Same as Rev 13:16-18\n The Mark of the Beast!\n \n You Disagree?\n As it is written,\n For the time will come \n when they will not endure sound doctrine; \n but after their own lusts \n shall they heap to themselves teachers, \n having itching ears;\n \n \n \n \n \n THE COST!\n \n Who knowing the judgment of God, \n that they which commit such things are worthy of death, \n not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them!\n How can ye escape the damnation of hell?\n \n \n \n JESUS IS THE ANSWER! ! ! !\n The only escape from the prison, darkness, and despair of the homosexual lifestyle is the Gospel! The world has turned it's back on you by telling you that once you choose to become a homosexual you are one for life and you cannot ever change. They even tell you that you are born that way. They have been sentenced to life with no possibility of parole or pardon. BUT Jesus Christ tells you there is a way out. He bought it at a great cost. He purchased it for you with his own life! He received a death sentence so you can be free! He offers you this pardon at no cost to you, all you have to do is believe and accept it. You could leave your jail cell today. But the world tells you that you can't leave? Why? Drugs users can quit their drug addiction. They say this so you will continue in their lifestyle. It makes them feel better when somebody else is doing the same thing they are. First thing a drug user has to do is to admit they have a problem and so do you. Do you believe the lie that you was born this way and since you was you have to accept it? What would the world be like if all drug users was told the same thing? Would not the number of drug users increase? Homosexuality is a Drug, the drug of Lust. It cannot ever be filled. The more you do, the more you want. Sex with a single partner doesn't satisfy your cravings. You want something different, somebody to satisfy your animal cravings of lust which cannot ever be satisfied! Lust & Sex is a Drug! Homosexual Sex offers more of a thrill for you then male-female sex does. Cocaine offers more of a thrill then a beer does. There is an escape for you! His name is Jesus Christ! Only Christ offers an escape from the prison of this world, the prison of drug use, and the prison of Homosexuality! He bought this right by his death on Calvary! He paid the price for sin once and for all because after 3 days he returned from the grave, and in so doing he let the captives free! All you have to do is to believe and repent of your sins and you can free and be a Son of God! Jesus Christ said \"I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me\". \n He can set you free of your prison!\n \n \n \n The Way Out of the Darkness of Homosexuality!\n \n As it is written, \n For by grace are ye saved through faith, \n and that not of yourselves: \n it is the gift of God:\n Not by works of righteousness which we have done, \n but according to his mercy he saved us, \n by the washing of regeneration,\n and renewing of the Holy Ghost \n \n \n How Does Jesus set me free? \n \n As it is written, \n For whosoever shall call \n upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\n Neither is there salvation in any other: \n for there is none other name under heaven \n given among men, whereby we must be saved. \n Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, \n and thou shalt be saved...\n \n For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; \n and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.\n \n \n \n Dear Lord Jesus,\n \n I admit honestly that\n I am a sinner, \n Please forgive me\n Of all my sins\n and come into my heart \n and change me forever. \n Thank you Jesus\n for taking my sins \n upon yourself and\n dying on that cross \n in my place.\n Be forever,\n My Personal\n Lord and Savior.\n Fill me with your \n Holy Spirit \n and your endless \n Love.\n Thank you for saving me\n I Love you \n Amen\n \n \n \n \n \n Therefore if any man be in Christ, \n he is a new creature: \n old things are passed away; \n behold, all things are become new. \n \n God says he is a new creature and he is no longer a homosexual! \n Jesus Christ Died to set the captives free! \n Not for them to remain in bondage to sin!\n You must publicily denouce your homosexuality!\n \n \n \n \n Jesus Christ taught us how to love!\n HAVE YOU LEARNED TO LOVE ENOUGH \n TO FIGHT AGAINST ALL OF OUR SINS\n THAT SENT HIM TO HIS DEATH?\n \n http://www.web-ministry.com/sin/homosexuality/index.php\n \n I will not be posting on this forum anymore......

   "Thank you, Jaaaman. Seems like a perfectly good reason to legalize it. \n \n Btw: you're a hypocrite. \n \n With publicity over gay marriages, the debate over homosexuality and the Bible once again fills the radio talk-show airwaves. \n \n Many of the hosts support gay marriages, but biblical arguments favoring the Christian fundamentalist cause go unchallenged. The debate usually goes something like this. \n \n HOST: So what's wrong with two loving, committed men or women being legally married? \n \n CALLER: The Bible says homosexuality is a sin. \n \n HOST: So you believe everything in the Bible is literally true? \n \n CALLER: Yes. \n \n HOST: Then you believe it's a sin to eat pork or shellfish, or for a man to shave his beard, and that those who work on the Sabbath should be put to death? \n \n CALLER: No, the coming of Jesus brought a New Covenant which freed us from those rules of the Old Testament. \n Score one for the fundamentalist. \n \n But with a few hours of Bible reading, the host could unmask the ever-popular New Covenant argument for what it really is: a justification for selective prejudice. \n \n HOST: But even under Christ's New Covenant, the New Testament is still the literal word of God isn't it? \n \n CALLER: Certainly. \n \n HOST: So you believe anyone who marries after divorce commits adultery (Mark 10:11); that women must remain silent, not teach, and have no authority over men (1Tim 2:11); and that slaves must obey their masters at all times (Col. 3:22). \n \n CALLER: Well . . . \n \n HOST: And if the New Covenant freed us from the regulations of the Old Testament, doesn't that do away with all three of its anti-gay passages ? \n \n CALLER: Um . . . no . . . the New Covenant primarily did away with the strict dietary and health rules, not the moral laws, of the Old Testament. \n \n HOST: So when Leviticus prescribes death for all adulterers and for all who curse their parents just before it prescribes the same penalty for any man who lies with another man, each of those moral laws applies to us today? \n \n CALLER: Well . . . I didn't say that . . . \n \n HOST: And when Deuteronomy prescribes death for nonvirgin brides shortly before it claims no homosexual shall be a son of Israel, you agree with both those moral laws? \n \n CALLER: Well, of course not . . . \n \n HOST: So you DO pick and choose which parts of the Bible to believe. \n Since fundamentalists are rarely confronted with these and other troubling Biblical passages, most sincerely think they believe every word of the Bible. \n \n When has Jerry Falwell called for the stoning for Ronald and Nancy Reagan, Pete and Gayle Wilson, and everyone else who has remarried after divorce? \n \n When has the Christian Coalition ever organized to ban women from teaching positions and from elected office? \n \n No, it's selective prejudice and old-fashioned fear of the unknown that motivates fundamentalists to target gays and lesbians. Biblical principle has nothing to do with it. Take away the phony claim to a literal view of the Bible, and the religious argument against homosexuality falls like a house of cards.\n \n http://fogarty.org/tim/gay_issues/fund_arg.html",

For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly.\"\n \n So if I let my son or daughter marry someone of a different religion, I will be killed suddenly.\n \n Deuteronomy 12:2-3 \"Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree: And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place.\"\n \n So I must destroy all places of worship of other Gods.\n \n Deuteronomy 13:1-5 \"If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a sign or a wonder, And the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them...And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death...So shalt thou put the evil away from the midst of thee.\"\n \n I must murder any phrophets of a different religion.\n \n Deuteronomy 13:6-10 \"If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers; Namely, of the gods of the people which are round about you, nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth; Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him: But thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people. And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die...\"\n \n If a friend or relative asks me to change my faith, I must kill him. If someone else wants to kill his friend or relative for this reason, I must help.\n \n Deuteronomy 13:12-15 \"If thou shalt hear say in one of thy cities, which the LORD thy God hath given thee to dwell there, saying, Certain men, the children of Belial, are gone out from among you, and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known; Then shalt thou inquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought among you; Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein, and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword.\"\n \n If anyone professes a different religion in my city, I must kill him.\n \n These are but a few of the quotes in the Old Testament which support killing people of other religions.\n \n Jaaaman, you ask me to listen to the words of a book which mandates that I murder countless people in cold blood.

This holds true if its words are wrong until justified by the New Testament. I could as easily write a book presenting random morals which would be just as useful.\n \n \nIt's true that Jesus himself never directly addressed the issue of homosexuality (though he didn't with many issues that we consider taboo or immoral today).

His silence on the issue cannot be assumed automatic disapproval when extrapolating the rest of his teachings about loving others implies that he would have approved. It is certain that Jesus did not have time to speak every morality and immorality; he sought to teach others the general rules about what is right and wrong so that they could apply those rules to any specific situation.\n \n But more importantly, I will argue that civil rights don't matter as much regarding whether Jesus would have called homosexuality immoral. Jesus would have allowed others with different beliefs to live their lives; I don't think he would have harmed them.\n \n \nHere is a good site that addresses various claims and arguments by the gay community on Christianity and homosexuality and lays out a reasonable thoughful response to each.

That answer suggests that Jesus may have stated that the sexually immoral will not go to heaven. However, it assumes that Jesus's definition of sexually immoral was that of those others of his time, and we already know that Jesus was teaching a new morality. Using Jesus's teaching to decide what he means by sexually immoral, it would be difficult to include homosexuality on the list. He also states that the term \"dogs\" may have referred to \"perverts\", however this also assumes that Jesus categorizes homosexuals as \"perverts\", which is a very bad assumption.\n \n The rest of his answers regarding Jesus attempt to answer the many arguments which suggest that Jesus would not have disapproved of homosexuality. He is attempting to deny that Jesus specifically accepted it in those, he is not attempting to show that Jesus specifically did not accept it.\n \n \nWith all that said, I don't think the early church was all that concerned about homosexuality. Not because they believed it was permissible, but because at the time they were not as much about the business of trying to be an avenue of social and cultural reform. They were about the business of the Christian gospel and worshipping Chist. The church should probably work to get back to this. However, I don't think it is wrong for Christians to be involved in the political and cultural discussions and debates, whatever their view. I just think the overall goals of the church should return to what they once were.\n\n \n I do not think anyone should be denied the right to participate in politics, but to be morally good they must understand that it is wrong to deny rights to others because of one's own religious belief. Many have a religious belief that homosexual marriage is a good thing, and one belief should not be able to deny equality to another, no matter the numbers.\n \n I think the Christian churches of the past did seek holy war too often; perhaps the church will always need wars in some form or another. It would be nice if Christian churches could focus more on the gospel and worshipping, but that may never be.",

   "The problem with using the Old Testament to show the inconsistencies and \"outdatedness\" of the Biblical view of homosexuality is that the New Testament also makes it clear that homosexual behavior is wrong.\n \n Romans 1:26-27: \"For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.\"\n\n \n ...and many biblical scholars believe Paul *who wrote this letter to the Romans* was probably closeted. \n \n \nCor 6:9-10: \"Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God. Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders 1nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God\" \n\n \n This really irks the hell out of me...NOT ONCE does the bible actually say ANYTHING about loving, committed homosexual relationships let alone actually use the word \"Homosexual\" ...BECAUSE THE WORD WASN'T EVEN INVENTED UNTIL THE NINTEENTH CENTURY!!! \n \n \n \nIt's true that Jesus himself never directly addressed the issue of homosexuality (though he didn't with many issues that we consider taboo or immoral today). Does his silence automatically mean permission in all such cases? I would argue not.\n\n \n and I would argue yes. Jesus hung out with TWELVE Men...and a prostitute...give me a break. \n \n \n Gay rights apoologists will say that Jesus' silence on this issue means he considered homosexual behavior permissible, but one could just as easily say that the reason for his silence is that it is such an obvious thing (that homosexuality is wrong) that it didn't need to be addressed.\n\n \n Somehow I just don't buy it. Also where in God's green earth do you get off calling anyone an apologist? All you \"christians\" are apologists!!! \n The Continuous LIES within the Translated Bible are just for starters...\n The continuous selective usage of scripture when it's convenient for your usages...\n Blantent ignorance of base errors in Bible stories, ...age of Moses, Wife of Kane (where did he just wander off to find her anyway? Hmmm...Guess Adam and Eve weren't the only busy couple after all!), the assumption that the Earth is the center of the Universe and that everything else revolves around it...and many more! \n \n \n \nHere is a good site that addresses various claims and arguments by the gay community on Christianity and homosexuality and lays out a reasonable thoughful response to each. (You have to click on each \"answer\" to read it.)\n \n http://home.messiah.edu/~chase/h/apologet/index.htm\n\n \n Oh yeah, a weirdo site written by a Mathmatics and Computer Science teacher at messiah college, in NOWHERESVILLE PA. Gees...one would think you could have done better than this. Thise guy has been out of the loop since the 1970's. He taught ONE freshman seminar course in Abortion and Homosexuality in 1993 and hasn't been asked to continue this seminar class. \n Somehow, it's just a flimsy gay-bashing site under the guise of being a \"Christian answers\" site. Most of the links listed are to \"Ex-gay Ministries\" not scientific research or even current psychological resources. \n This guy is a gay-hating NUT JOB...\n \n \n \nWith all that said, I don't think the early church was all that concerned about homosexuality.

   "SPECIAL NOTE on Romans 1:31, where the King James Version translated the Greek word astorgous as \"without natural affection.\" This is one of the characteristics of people \"with a reprobate mind\" (KJV of 1:28). The word for \"reprobate\" is more recently translated as \"depraved\" or \"perverted\" in order more neatly to fit the sexualizing of everything possible in the list. The literal meaning of \"reprobate\" (Greek dokimon) is \"to fail to measure up\" or \"to fail to meet the test\" and simply means that the list of things that follows is the result of a mind that has abandoned God. The word astorgous, \"without natural affection,\" is used only here and in 2 Timothy 3:3. It has nothing at all to do with homosexuality or with sex. It is the Greek word for \"family love\" or \"family ties\" with the negative prefix. It refers to people who despise and reject their family members. Rather than being directed at homosexuals, it is a term that is directed at people who despise and reject their own homosexual children and brothers and sisters! Modern translators, knowing this, usually render the word as \"unloving,\" and the implication of some sort of \"unnatural\" or \"perverted\" affection is removed. Many more translation corrections are needed elsewhere!\n \n The use of Romans 1:26-27 against homosexuals turns out to be a blunt instrument to batter and wound people who were not intended in the original text. Paul clearly taught throughout Romans, Galatians and his other letters that God's freely given and all inclusive love is for every person on earth. Notice what Paul said about judging others in Romans 2:1: \"Therefore you are without excuse, every one of you who passes judgment, for in that you judge another, you condemn yourself; for you who judge practice the same things.\" \n http://www.truluck.com/html/six_bible_passages.html#Romans1:26-27",

   "Nice post, Joe.\n \n psssst, Justine....lady I generally am in agreement with you and think you rock hard - but there is nothing in the Bible that indicates that Mary Magdelene was a prostitute (that was made up later by the church).\n\n \n \n Ah, now you are starting to get it. See...\n \n Mary was historically portrayed as having been a whore, even though you and I both know there is nothing in the Bible to substanciate this claim. There's not even anything remotely insinuating that she ever was. But historically men, fearful of women having any power within the church would call Mary a whore simply to put all women down. \n I find it amazing concidering Mary was the ONLY woman who followed Jesus as passionately as she did, she was the one to find the tomb empty and the first to witness his resurrection. Upon further look at the role Mary actually had, we now tend to lean to the more likely idea that Mary was the ONE to be Jesus' sucessor, and of course this just upsets men to no end.\n \n See? This is a direct reflection of society and it's willingness to accept women in roles other than that of property, even powerful roles. \n Gays still haven't won this battle yet. Society still refuses to look into how devistatingly wrong translations have been in regard to the texts of the Bible and the words which were used. \n The problems are many in interpreting and translating, there are no direct formulas. As languages grow and change so too does translating from one language to another. It's much easier to accept base connotations rather than find out the full meaning and usage of a specific word. \n If I say \"lead\" do you know which usage of this word I intend? Not out of context, no. I could mean an action of having someone follow or I could mean the element \"Pb\". \n Since there weren't many examples of commited, life-long homosexual relationships within the contexts of the Bible, how are we to actually know what type of homosexuality is meant? Just as sex before marriage is discouraged, so to is promiscuous sexual relations of anytype. But life-long relationships between members of the same gender are simply not shown, why?",

If that's at all what you meant.\n \n If not, if you actually meant spouse, then you're simply confused.\n \n \n The only way they can do it is by bringing in a third party in some way, not involved in the relationship (an opposite-gender person outside of the relationship, a doctor, fertility clinic, etc)\n\n \n Really? So a gay man or lesbian must first have a same gender partner in order to call in a \"third party\" right? So, you're now assuming that all gays or lesbians who have had children who are biologically related MUST be same gender partnered in the first place. Ever hear of single parenting, ever hear of a gay/lesbian marrying or having sexual relations with a heterosexual and NOT being partnered with someone of the same gender? \n \n You really do live in your own little fantasy world. Your mind is made up, don't confuse you with the facts.",

Women could not be degraded by such an act as they were already not held in high esteem. \n There is a theory that the Hebrew people believed in a perfect order of creation and anything that violated that order was considered unclean or an abomination. A probable example would be that fish were considered the perfect sea animal, hence anything in the sea that did not have scales and fins was unclean. (Lev. 11:9-10) Cattle were the perfect cud chewing animal, hence anything that chewed cud, but didn't have hooves was unclean. (Lev. 11:6).

It would seem to mix the sex role of the imperfect woman with the ideal role of the man. \n \n \n Even if you disagree with the theories stated above you should take note that these verses are a part of the Hebrew scriptures often called the 'Holiness Code'.

Eating pork, shellfish, lobster, eating meat 3 days old, trimming beards, etc is just as much an \"abomination\". It is used throughout the OT to designate those Jewish sins which involve ethnic contamination or idolatry. In many other OT verses it simply means idolatry. Lev 18 is specifically designed to distinguish the Jews from the pagans among whom they had been living.

Since they were only commanded to Jews, no one who is not Jewish need worry about obeying them.\n\n \n So why do modern Christians even worry about anything written in the Holiness Code in the first place? Good question, it's not answered here, but it's worth asking. \n \n Next: \n \n \nChapter 20 begins with a prohibition of sexual idolatry almost identical with this, and like 18, its manifest purpose is to elaborate a system of ritual \"cleanliness\" whereby the Jews will be distinguished from neighboring peoples.\n\n \n I find this whole concept facinating.

When reaching puberty, the normal human starts producing gametes, or releasing gametes. These are haploid cells consiting of 23 chromosomes. For a zygote to occur, normally a halpod sperm and halpolid egg must fuse. Now, since each egg is haploid, there is theotrically a way to fuse the 23 chrosomones of two eggs into a diploid zygote and then implant it in a womb. Of course this would be done outside of the body, and the newly created zygote would need a eletricial shock, but it is possible to do.

Jerry Falwell is one thing--I agree he has 'attacked' gay people at times. (I don't agree with a lot of what he says, either.) But if you look at the points raised by many people in this forum who disagree with you, they often aren't making blanket statements like \"television shows featuring gay people shouldn't be shown to children,\" or \"gay people are an abomination.\" I think you may have come to the point to where you tend to interpret any disagreement in such a way, even if it's not stated. This is an example of isogesis of another's argument, i.e. reading something into an argument that is not necessarily there. \n \n If we take the recent discussions on Spongebob for instance, the argument I made was that there's too much attempt in cartoons and other entertainment to insert PC social messages period (and some of you disagreed, which is fine). But that's not the same as saying gay people shouldn't be on television: a much different idea. I don't particularly want to watch Will and Grace, but I'm not fighting to get them off television at all.\n \n I just think it's better to deal with each argument on it's own merits here, regardless of what we assume may be implied. And to be fair, you are good about this and I appreciate your willingness to discuss things with a nice demeanor.",

   "Leviticus 18:1-20 deals with sexual sin. Sexual sin is not called abominable here or anywhere else in the Old Testament. Abomination simply means a ritual offense: goat herders were an abomination to the Egyptians; dead bugs, pork chops and stale sacrificial food were specifically listed as abominations to the Hebrews. Often, an idol is called an abomination. Sexual sin is immoral. Religious irregularities are abominable.\n \n Leviticus 18:21-30 deals with Molech worship, which involved prostitution, bestiality and a form of infant sacrifice: the idol, being hollow, was actually a furnace. The infant was placed in a carrier and drawn through the idol-thus the odd phrase pass through the fire to Molech in some translations. The will of Molech was divined by the condition of the infant afterwards. The Bible, despite its detractors, is even-handed in its treatment of the sexes, and yet female homosexuality is not mentioned here. If this is a sexual sin oddly placed out of context in the middle of a discussion of pagan worship, it is the only time in the entire Bible that a sexual sin is abominable-except for cult prostitution, which was an irregular religious practice. This is why the woman who deceived a patriarch by dressing up and playing the role of a prostitute went unpunished. She was not a cult prostitute. The Old Testament makes a distinction which is lost on us.\n \n The best explanation for those bound by the Jewish Law is that this is male cult prostitution, properly placed in an appropriate setting and rightly called an abomination. We cannot derive from this that homosexuality is banned any more than we can conclude that all heterosexuality is banned because of attacks on other forms of prostitution.\n\n http://www.kencollins.com/bible-i9.htm#leviticus",

   "I understand, but for what the phrase is used for in my experience indeed IS a defining characteristic of all gay people. Isn't the one thing gay people have in common same-sex relationships?\n\n \n Sure, forming same-sex relationships is what distinguishes being gay from being straight, but being gay doesn't affect any other aspects of a person's life. It isn't a defining characteristic of gay people because it doesn't really define who they are, it just describes a single feature. See, if we just wanted to explain that someone is gay, we would say \"that person is gay\", but if we instead say that a person \"lives a gay lifestyle\", we imply that being gay defines the way he or she lives.\n \n \nMaybe some think of the stereotypes you mentioned when hearing the phrase, but I don't. I guess I just don't see what the big deal is with refering to the aspect of forming relationships as a lifestyle.\n\n \n I believe that you don't mean the stereotypes that I mentioned, and I believe that you don't mean that homosexuality affects any aspect of that person's life except who that person loves, but the term \"lifestyle\" implies more than that to others, whether you meant it or not. Gay people are faced today with countless people who fight to keep them from having the same civil rights as straight people; some may think those who fight against gay rights are correct, but that does not change the situation. Many use the arguments and assumptions that being gay somehow affects their morality, their ability to raise children, their religion, their sexual responsibility, the way they act, or their motivations. Being gay doesn't affect any of those things, yet gay people are often forced to live with such prejudice and insults when they ask why they do not deserve equal civil rights. When you use the term \"gay lifestyle\", it sounds like you assume something incredibly insulting and untrue of gay people, whether you really do or not.\n \n These sorts of unintentional insults fill the world of debates on gay rights. The person opposed to gay rights issues a grave insult unintentionally, the gay person is insulted nonetheless, and the insults become rampant until both debaters have decided that the other is simply a jerk. But if we can recognize why we insult others and if we can recognize that others are not intentionally insulting us, then perhaps some of this can be avoided.",

   "...and we think that, like in past elections, where arch-conservatives have used code words, the code word in this election will be gay lifestyle, which will be used to label us as all as being single and sexually promiscuous, Lazin says\n http://www.washblade.com/2004/4-23/arts/activism/global.cfm\n \nYou may be unaware of this, but describing my gayness as a \"lifestyle\" is a code word, a way of dismissing my ability to love, my hopes and my dreams, as if they were something I casually decided to do one morning, like taking a Caribbean cruise. \n http://www.yforum.com/sex61.html\n \nProf. James E. Humphreys of the University of Massachusetts comments, ''I welcome the libertarian approach, but I am somewhat taken aback by your uncritical use of the code word lifestyle . . . always derogative in intent (as in 'immoral chosen lifestyle').'' David Appell of Miami Shores, Fla., writes, ''Lifestyle is a politicized, freighted word meant to devalue sexual orientation as a mere choice rather than something intrinsically and neutrally part of human biology and identity.'' \n http://forums.nytimes.com/top/opinion/readersopinions/forums/national/gayrights/index.html?offset=11299\n \nThe phrase \"gay lifestyle\" is a code word for a lot of things, and generally not used in anything resembling a complimentary way. Rampant promiscuity is the first concept that leaps to mind, along with other typical stereotypes (deliberately exaggerated effeminate behavior, dress or mannerisms, a Charles Nelson Reilly lisp, you know the drill. I could name a dozen characters from TV and films right off the top of my head.) \n \n http://www.smirkingchimp.com/article.php?thold=-1&mode=nested&order=0&sid=11204\n \nTogether with the fact that NARTH documents use right-wing buzzphrases like \"the gay lifestyle\", the verdict is clear: christian-right propaganda and disinformation in the guise of science.\n http://www.webpan.com/dsinclair/antigay.html\n \nThese are ex-gay ministries, which translated into plain English means cult-like groups which prey on gays and lesbians who are dissatisfied with their lifes, or, to use the terminology of the religious right, with the \"gay lifestyle\".\n\n http://www.webpan.com/dsinclair/antigay.html\n \nThe term \"lifestyle\", or sometimes \"lifestyle choice\", appears often in anti-gay literature. The motive: to recast homosexual orientation as superficial habits, or mere consumerism. Considered agenda-laden by many gay persons; an attempt by anti-gay groups to demean an essential part of their personhood. \n http://www.geocities.com/plusg1/why_hostile_02.htm\n \nThe supposed \"black lifestyle\" centers on crime, drugs and idleness, whereas the supposed \"gay lifestyle\" centers on promiscuity, disease and political extremism; but the aversions engendered by the two clusters of anti-social stereotypes are not so very different.\n http://www.indegayforum.org/authors/rauch/rauch4.html\n \nWe're also demonstrating to Jerry Falwell that his anti-gay rhetoric about the \"gay lifestyle\" is not based on reality.\n \n http://www.soulforce.org/habitatinfo.html",

   "Thank you, Jaaaman. Seems like a perfectly good reason to legalize it. \n \n Btw: you're a hypocrite. \n \n With publicity over gay marriages, the debate over homosexuality and the Bible once again fills the radio talk-show airwaves. \n \n Many of the hosts support gay marriages, but biblical arguments favoring the Christian fundamentalist cause go unchallenged. The debate usually goes something like this. \n \n HOST: So what's wrong with two loving, committed men or women being legally married? \n \n CALLER: The Bible says homosexuality is a sin. \n \n HOST: So you believe everything in the Bible is literally true? \n \n CALLER: Yes. \n \n HOST: Then you believe it's a sin to eat pork or shellfish, or for a man to shave his beard, and that those who work on the Sabbath should be put to death? \n \n CALLER: No, the coming of Jesus brought a New Covenant which freed us from those rules of the Old Testament. \n Score one for the fundamentalist. \n \n But with a few hours of Bible reading, the host could unmask the ever-popular New Covenant argument for what it really is: a justification for selective prejudice. \n \n HOST: But even under Christ's New Covenant, the New Testament is still the literal word of God isn't it? \n \n CALLER: Certainly. \n \n HOST: So you believe anyone who marries after divorce commits adultery (Mark 10:11); that women must remain silent, not teach, and have no authority over men (1Tim 2:11); and that slaves must obey their masters at all times (Col. 3:22). \n \n CALLER: Well . . . \n \n HOST: And if the New Covenant freed us from the regulations of the Old Testament, doesn't that do away with all three of its anti-gay passages ? \n \n CALLER: Um . . . no . . . the New Covenant primarily did away with the strict dietary and health rules, not the moral laws, of the Old Testament. \n \n HOST: So when Leviticus prescribes death for all adulterers and for all who curse their parents just before it prescribes the same penalty for any man who lies with another man, each of those moral laws applies to us today? \n \n CALLER: Well . . . I didn't say that . . . \n \n HOST: And when Deuteronomy prescribes death for nonvirgin brides shortly before it claims no homosexual shall be a son of Israel, you agree with both those moral laws? \n \n CALLER: Well, of course not . . . \n \n HOST: So you DO pick and choose which parts of the Bible to believe. \n Since fundamentalists are rarely confronted with these and other troubling Biblical passages, most sincerely think they believe every word of the Bible. \n \n When has Jerry Falwell called for the stoning for Ronald and Nancy Reagan, Pete and Gayle Wilson, and everyone else who has remarried after divorce? \n \n When has the Christian Coalition ever organized to ban women from teaching positions and from elected office? \n \n No, it's selective prejudice and old-fashioned fear of the unknown that motivates fundamentalists to target gays and lesbians. Biblical principle has nothing to do with it. Take away the phony claim to a literal view of the Bible, and the religious argument against homosexuality falls like a house of cards.\n \n http://fogarty.org/tim/gay_issues/fund_arg.html\n\n \n \n \n This is just ot help explain the law of Moses and why it isn't good law.\n \n \n Rom 7\n 1 KNOW ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the alaw\u0095 hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?\n \n 2 For the awoman which hath an bhusband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.\n \n 3 So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.\n \n 4 Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become adead\u0095 to the blaw\u0095 by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.\n \n 5 aFor\u0095 when we were in the flesh, the bmotions\u0095 of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto cdeath\u0095.\n \n 6 But now we are adelivered\u0095 from the law, that being bdead\u0095 wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of cspirit\u0095, and not in the oldness of the letter.\n \n This how the debate should've gone\n \n \n HOST: So what's wrong with two loving, committed men or women being legally married? \n \n CALLER: It has no benefit and more detrimental behavior. Marraige is for promoting families and children.\n \n HOST: So you believe everything in the Bible is literally true? \n \n CALLER: AS far as it is translated correctly and not symbolic\n \n HOST: Then you believe it's a sin to eat pork or shellfish, or for a man to shave his beard, and that those who work on the Sabbath should be put to death? \n \n CALLER: Acts 10\n 10 And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a atrance\u0095,\n \n 11 And saw aheaven\u0095 opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet bknit\u0095 at the four corners, and let down to the earth:\n \n 12 Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.\n \n 13 And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.\n \n 14 But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or aunclean\u0095.\n \n 15 And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath acleansed\u0095, that call not thou bcommon\u0095.\n \n 16 This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.\n \n \n \n \n \n But with a few hours of Bible reading, the host could unmask the ever-popular New Covenant argument for what it really is: a justification for selective prejudice. \n \n HOST: But even under Christ's New Covenant, the New Testament is still the literal word of God isn't it? \n \n CALLER: Certainly. \n \n HOST: So you believe anyone who marries after divorce commits adultery (Mark 10:11); that women must remain silent, not teach, and have no authority over men (1Tim 2:11); and that slaves must obey their masters at all times (Col. 3:22). \n \n CALLER: \n Actually Mark 10 says\n \n 7 For this cause shall a aman leave his father and mother, and cleave to his bwife;\n \n 8 And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh.\n \n 9 What therefore God hath ajoined together, let not man put basunder.\n \n 10 And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter.\n \n 11 And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her.\n \n 12 And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.\n \n 13 \u00b6 And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them.\n \n If you put away your wife so you can seek your own pleasures, then spiritually you're an adulterer.\n \n \n The Timothy reference is out of context.\n \n Actually you mean 1Tim 2:12. The verse is \n \n 10 But (which becometh women professing agodliness) with good works.\n \n 11 Let the woman learn in asilence with all subjection.\n \n 12 But I suffer not a woman to ateach, nor to busurp\u0095 authority over the man, but to be in csilence\u0095.\n \n And if you read earlier in the chapter it tells everyone to live in silence.\n \n 2 For akings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and bpeaceable clife in all godliness and dhonesty\u0095.\n \n 3 For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour\n \n \n The Colossians references means respect the laws. When there is a law you live withint it not break it. \n \n It seems appalling to many the laws allowing porn, abortion, prostitution, etc, but we beleive you don't break the law you learn to change it. So int aht historical context I agree. \n \n \n HOST: And if the New Covenant freed us from the regulations of the Old Testament, doesn't that do away with all three of its anti-gay passages ? \n \n CALLER: NO because it is re-codified in the new t estament.\n Col 3\n \n 5 aMortify\u0095 therefore your bmembers\u0095 which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, cinordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and dcovetousness, which is eidolatry:\n \n 2Tim 3\n \n 1 THIS know also, that in the alast\u0095 days perilous btimes\u0095 shall come.\n \n 2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, acovetous, boasters, bproud, blasphemers, cdisobedient to parents, dunthankful, unholy,\n \n 3 Without anatural\u0095 baffection, ctrucebreakers, dfalse\u0095 accusers, eincontinent\u0095, fierce, despisers of those that are good,\n \n \n \n \n HOST: So when Leviticus prescribes death for all adulterers and for all who curse their parents just before it prescribes the same penalty for any man who lies with another man, each of those moral laws applies to us today? \n \n CALLER: No that is the law of Moses \n \n HOST: And when Deuteronomy prescribes death for nonvirgin brides shortly before it claims no homosexual shall be a son of Israel, you agree with both those moral laws? \n \n CALLER: Taken out of context.

The birds and the bees just don't work that way. So the phrase \"same-sex couples are able to have children\" without qualifying it is a bit misleading.\n\n \n Well, I don't really think it is misleading, per say. I mean, we all know how reproduction works here; I don't need to spell that out. In order to explain my intent, I'll have to introduce you to Jaxian Debate Theory (JDT), but I have to warn you all that this will probably be boring:\n \n My response was intended to provoke some thought and to draw my opponent into a sort of logic trap. I intend my opponent to think something along the lines of the following:\n \n \"Well, I guess some gay couples can have children, but it's not the same as straight couples. Gay couples can only adopt, get artificial fertilization, have children from some other relationship, godparent, etc.\"\n \n Then when my opponent responds with that, I respond with something like:\n \n \"Aha! So then marriage is not about family and children as you claimed, it is only about some families with some children. But it doesn't make sense to only include some families, we should include all loving familes with children. It is wrong to grant marriage to one family but deny it to another family with the same needs.\"\n \n From there, my opponent's argument generally becomes one of the following:\n \n -Heterosexual sex and pregnancy are the true foundations of marriage\n -Opposite-sex parents are the only ideal environment for raising a child\n -Gays are <insert myth or stereotype here<\n -The \"gay lifestyle\" is dangerous\n -I don't care, the Bible says gays are evil.\n \n The debate continues along whichever path my opponent brings up. This is what I want to happen because in a sense, I've made certain that my opponent is no longer able to make the claim that marriage is about family and children, and in fact I am the one who is now able to say that in support of same-sex marriage. Switching up someone's argument like that is a powerful technique because although everyone is too stubborn to admit that they are wrong in a debate, in later years of their life my opponents are more likely to come to the understanding that they have been wrong if the same arguments they originally used to oppose same-sex marriage now actually support it.\n \n Standard debate theory focuses on changing people's minds immediately because in standard debates, it is changing minds immediately that matters; JDT focuses on changing minds in the long run.\n \n Although this same thing may have happened if I had specifically pointed out that the claim is truly based on procreation, I feel it is more effective if I force my opponent to alter his statement himself, not if I specifically communicate that change to him.

I can understand how it sort of \"rubs salt in the wound\" when it comes to the AIDS crisis and gay men, but their refusal to take gay men blood donations simply reflects the reality that there is much more danger of having AIDS-infected blood from gay men than any other exposure group in the U.S. The stats don't lie.\n\n \n Stats don't lie, but they don't speak for themselves either. Stats are meaningless without interpretation. In this case, Red Cross has very much misinterpreted the statistics. They feel that people who engage in male-male homosexual sex are more likely to donate a sample of blood that is infected with AIDS. This is not the case for all homosexuals. Joebrummer did a good job in pointing this out. Quite a few homosexuals and bisexuals engage in monogamous relationships with another who does not have AIDS and thus they are at zero risk of AIDS. Also, many homosexuals get themselves tested for AIDS. A gay man who has engaged in a monogamous relationship and both members of that relationship have been tested for AIDS is at an incredibly lower risk of AIDS than a promiscuous heterosexual. When it comes down to it, it does not make sense to prevent people who have had safe sex or who have been tested for AIDS from donating blood; it only makes sense to deny those who have had many sexual partners from donating blood because those are the people who are truly at a higher risk from AIDS. Now, I don't think that the Red Cross holds anything against gay men, but I do think that their decision is a result of prejudice, not of a good reason. If they're taking the word of the donor that he hasn't had gay sex, they're better off taking the word of the donor that he or she hasn't had promiscuous sex because those are the people who are really at risk.",

   "Considering people that engage in gay sex can't donate blood, have higher rates of colon, gastrinal intestinal problems,vaginal problems,higher rates of infection, etc\n\n \n WOW, really? Cause everytime I've donated blood I have NEVER been turned away or told I can't because I'm a lesbian. Nor have I been told this because of having GURD (Gastro-esophogial Reflux Disease). \n \n \n \n \nBasically your argument, if we discount everything that has been stated in the scriptures are not divinely inspired then it doesn't apply.\n\n \n Not in the realm of legal issues, no. \n \n \nIn the context of scriputres, inordinate and unnatura refer to homosexuality. So tehy both applyl\n\n \n Hmmm...show me in their original forms. Firstly, the word \"homosexual\" wasn't even coined until the late 1800's therefore it could not have ever have been used in the original texts of \"the scriptures\". Also the words that were used and have been popularly MISTRANSLATED are as follows: \n \n \n The two words in the original Greek are \"malakoi\" and \"arsenokoitai\".\n \n Malakoi is a very common Greek word. It literally means \"soft\". It is used in Matthew 11:7-18 and Luke 7:24-25 in reference to soft clothing. Scholars have to look at material outside of the Bible in order to try and figure out just what this means. The early church Fathers used the word to mean someone who was \"weak\" or \"soft\" in their morals and from the time of the reformation to the 20th century it was usually interpreted as masturbation. In Greek this word never is applied to gay people or homosexual acts in general.\n \n The word translated as \"homosexual\" or \"sexual pervert\" or some other similar term is Greek arsenokoites, which was formed from two words meaning \"male\" and \"bed.\" This word is not found anywhere else in the Bible and has not been found anywhere in the contemporary Greek of Paul's time. We do not know what it means. The word is obscure and uncertain. It probably refers to male prostitutes with female customers, which was a common practice in the Roman world, as revealed in the excavations at Pompeii and other sites.",

It doesn't change the fact that there is a greater possibility of getting HIV tainted blood from gay men than straight men. It's as simple as that--the stats tell us so.

The colon and gastrinal intestinal problems you speak of are miniscule in their effect, very uncommon, very preventable, and do not have any effect on society as a whole. The risk of such a problem is well worth the benefit to the males who engage in sex with other males. Not a single one of these things is detrimental to society.\n\n Most places don't accept it. The fact is homosexuality is detrimental and society does not benefit from homosexuality. You haven't named anything yet as a benefit.\n \n \n \nIf by \"infection\" you meant infection through sexually transmitted diseases, then you've hit something that is detrimental to society. However, it is improper to associate sexually transmitted diseases to homosexuality, for the vast majority of those who engage in homosexual activity are at zero risk of sexually transmitted diseases, for they are not engaging in irresponsible sex. When considering this, it becomes very apparent that homosexuality is not the cause of the spread of STD's, irresponsible sex is. Identifying the correct cause of the problem is very important for it determines the correct solution. If the problem were homosexuality, it may or may not make sense to discourage homosexuality by denying same-sex marriage. But since the problem is irresponsible sex, we are only making the problem worse by denying same-sex marriage. By denying such marriage, we encourage promiscuity and irresponsible sex. If we consider that the problem is irresponsible sex, the solution is clearly to discourage irresponsible sex. There are few better ways of discouraging that than allowing marriage.\nWhen I said infection I mean illnesses in general. Stats indicate gays are not as healthy as others.\n Since there is no benefit then there is no reason to promote it with marriage.\n \n \n \n \n\n Really? I don't claim to know the context that quote was used in; I only claim to know the definitions of the words unnatural and inordinate. What evidence is there to suggest that the Bible uses a context that takes these words outside of their definitions?\n\n No they are used in their definitions. In their context in their definitions it refers to homosexuality. How did you expect them to refer to a word that didn't exist back then?",

Waht is this thread and the discussion about?\n \n \n \n \nHmmm...show me in their original forms. Firstly, the word \"homosexual\" wasn't even coined until the late 1800's therefore it could not have ever have been used in the original texts of \"the scriptures\". Also the words that were used and have been popularly MISTRANSLATED are as follows: \n \n \n The two words in the original Greek are \"malakoi\" and \"arsenokoitai\".\n \n Malakoi is a very common Greek word. It literally means \"soft\". It is used in Matthew 11:7-18 and Luke 7:24-25 in reference to soft clothing. Scholars have to look at material outside of the Bible in order to try and figure out just what this means. The early church Fathers used the word to mean someone who was \"weak\" or \"soft\" in their morals and from the time of the reformation to the 20th century it was usually interpreted as masturbation. In Greek this word never is applied to gay people or homosexual acts in general.\n \n The word translated as \"homosexual\" or \"sexual pervert\" or some other similar term is Greek arsenokoites, which was formed from two words meaning \"male\" and \"bed.\" This word is not found anywhere else in the Bible and has not been found anywhere in the contemporary Greek of Paul's time. We do not know what it means. The word is obscure and uncertain. It probably refers to male prostitutes with female customers, which was a common practice in the Roman world, as revealed in the excavations at Pompeii and other sites.\n\n \n You need to credit your source when you cut and paste.\n \n First off I agree many terms were mistranslated from the KJV and other versions. However since so many versions such as the spanish, german, etc which weren't based off of the KJV are translated similarly we can see what has been translated properly and what hasn't.\n afysikos and asynithistos are used many times in the current version of greek new testament. They mean not of nature which can easily be translated to mean \"unnatural\".\n \n The other word asemnos\n is the word commonly found int he current greek translation. Which has no literal translation but means disorderly or archaic which also means \"inordinate\".\n \n \n The other arguments are just conjecture. They are relevant and is rhetoric not related to my argument. They attck scriputres that other use but not argument.",

   "Most places don't accept it. The fact is homosexuality is detrimental and society does not benefit from homosexuality. You haven't named anything yet as a benefit.\n\n \n Well, you certainly haven't named anything detrimental. If you'd like some benefits, I will explain:\n \n Gay sex in itself is only slightly beneficial: It brings joy and closeness to those involved, promoting love and monogamy to that loved one. The same is true of heterosexual sex. Gay sex is not harmful, and because we live in a free nation, it should not be denied.\n \n Same-sex marriage, however, is very, very beneficial. Allowing same-sex marriage first of all grants equality to the religious beliefs which feel that same-sex marriage is religiously acceptable. Also, it brings equality to same-sex couples in that they are no longer denied that which others are allowed. Also, it encourages freedom because the government is not promoting one lifestyle over another. Also, same-sex marriages help the individuals involved financially support one another in times of need, as well as providing emotional support. Also, same-sex marriages provide loving families which are ideal for raising children. Also, married same-sex couples are more likely to adopt their children instead of using birth, which means that less children will have to grow up in an adoption home. Also, same-sex marriage discourages promiscuity in homosexuals. This discouragement of promiscuity is likely to dampen the spread of STD's. Also, same-sex marriage allows homosexuals to feel they have acceptance in society which makes them less likely to engage in other deviant behaviors.\n \n That's just off the top of my head. We can get all of those benefits at no price by legalizing same-sex marriage. Sounds like a good deal to me. I'm sure you feel there is a price, so why not tell me what that price is?\n \n \nWhen I said infection I mean illnesses in general. Stats indicate gays are not as healthy as others.\n Since there is no benefit then there is no reason to promote it with marriage.\n\n \n Of course, there are all the benefit I listed above, and perhaps more. Anyhow, statistics don't lie, but they never, ever speak for themselves. Homosexuality is not the cause of increased illness. The standard homosexual is no less healthy in any way, shape, nor form than the standard heterosexual. However, there is a subculture of homosexuals which engages in activities (these activities are the real cause of the increased illness, not homosexuality) which might make them more prone to illness, and this is likely to bring up statistics. Fortunately the activities of that subculture can be discouraged by legalizing same-sex marriage, and there is no reason to believe that any new people would become part of this subculture were it legalized.\n \n \nNo they are used in their definitions. In their context in their definitions it refers to homosexuality. How did you expect them to refer to a word that didn't exist back then?\n\n \n Well, I did not expect them to use terms which mean something very different. If someone was referring to homosexuality yet had no word for it, I would expect that person to describe homosexuality just as the Old Testament did. I would not expect someone to say a word that is unrelated to homosexuality then expect everyone to know what he meant. If someone said, \"promiscuous sex is bad\" I would never think, \"Oh, what he really meant is sex between two men is bad\".",

   "Well, you certainly haven't named anything detrimental. If you'd like some benefits, I will explain:\n \n Gay sex in itself is only slightly beneficial: It brings joy and closeness to those involved, promoting love and monogamy to that loved one. The same is true of heterosexual sex. Gay sex is not harmful, and because we live in a free nation, it should not be denied.\n \n Same-sex marriage, however, is very, very beneficial. Allowing same-sex marriage first of all grants equality to the religious beliefs which feel that same-sex marriage is religiously acceptable. Also, it brings equality to same-sex couples in that they are no longer denied that which others are allowed. Also, it encourages freedom because the government is not promoting one lifestyle over another. Also, same-sex marriages help the individuals involved financially support one another in times of need, as well as providing emotional support. Also, same-sex marriages provide loving families which are ideal for raising children. Also, married same-sex couples are more likely to adopt their children instead of using birth, which means that less children will have to grow up in an adoption home. Also, same-sex marriage discourages promiscuity in homosexuals. This discouragement of promiscuity is likely to dampen the spread of STD's. Also, same-sex marriage allows homosexuals to feel they have acceptance in society which makes them less likely to engage in other deviant behaviors.\n \n That's just off the top of my head. We can get all of those benefits at no price by legalizing same-sex marriage. Sounds like a good deal to me. I'm sure you feel there is a price, so why not tell me what that price is?\n\n First off it's bad public policy. It's like the government legalizing alcohol and tobacco. Now because of that many other harmful things are trying to be approved because of the precedent of alcohol and tobacco.\n \n Second it will promote the behavior. By sanctioning homosexuality it will encourage or at elast enable the behavior that is detrimental. It will basically be promoting the behavior and make people struggling with it less likely to seek treatment.\n \n Third it would put more of a strain on health care by forcing insurers to either drop spouses or insure less healthy behaviors.\n \n The list goes on but that will do for now. \n \n With respect to detriments of homosexuality. Put out your criteria for information and I will post the information about the detriments of gay behaviors. I've doen it in the past and everyone dismisses it becasue of the study was flawed, etc. So name the criteria and I'll post the information.\n \n \n \n \n \nOf course, there are all the benefit I listed above, and perhaps more. Anyhow, statistics don't lie, but they never, ever speak for themselves. Homosexuality is not the cause of increased illness. The standard homosexual is no less healthy in any way, shape, nor form than the standard heterosexual. However, there is a subculture of homosexuals which engages in activities (these activities are the real cause of the increased illness, not homosexuality) which might make them more prone to illness, and this is likely to bring up statistics. Fortunately the activities of that subculture can be discouraged by legalizing same-sex marriage, and there is no reason to believe that any new people would become part of this subculture were it legalized.\n\n So most gay promisicuity in Mass has declined becasue of gay marriage? There is a significat delcine in that behavior in Mass, sufficient to support outweight the disadvantages?\n \n Homosexuality itself is detrimental. List your criteria and I will post the information. \n \n \n \n \nWell, I did not expect them to use terms which mean something very different. If someone was referring to homosexuality yet had no word for it, I would expect that person to describe homosexuality just as the Old Testament did. I would not expect someone to say a word that is unrelated to homosexuality then expect everyone to know what he meant. If someone said, \"promiscuous sex is bad\" I would never think, \"Oh, what he really meant is sex between two men is bad\".\n\n \n Yeah but he used words that did relate to it.",

   "Sorry for butting in but:\n \n \n \n \n Is false. In 2010, china will have slightly more elderly as a percentage of their population than the US (one or two percetnage points). But the difference is rather insignificant. I also think you are exagerating the problems of an aging population... I am confident that homosexuality has no impact whatsoever on this phenomenon. If you want to do something about it, start killing of old people and demand that every heterosexual should at least give birth to two children with the threat of death openalty hanging over their heads. That would at least be effective, and it would be about as humane as demanding that homosexuals should be punished for their lack of procreation\n\n \n \n Japan & China\n \n Japan, with fewer than 1.4 children per family, is one of the fastest aging nations in the world. Whole villages have no one left but elderly folks. A September New York Times article reported that, because of the shortage of young wage earners, Japan's rate of savings will be zero or even negative by the year 2010. By 2025, 73% of Japan's income will be going for social welfare, largely for health care and pensions for the elderly.\n \n Of course, the Chinese are the worst off. For 15 years, the Red Regime has forcibly inserted abortifacient IUD's into mothers after the birth of their first child. After two children, the State forcibly sterilizes them. Mothers, pregnant without the permission of the Communist Party, are subjected to forced abortions. It has been 15 years of a one child per family policy, resulting in mostly boys. In a few years, there will be social turbulence and violence when tens of millions of young men cannot find wives.\n \n \n Underdeveloped Nations Also\n \n The birth dearth has spread well beyond the developed world. Twenty-seven developing countries now have fewer than 2.2 children per woman, which means they are not reproducing their own numbers. In 1985, the world's total fertility rate - the number of children born per woman in her reproductive lifetime - was 4.2. Now, worldwide, it's 2.9 and dropping.\n \n Today 79 countries are dying because of birth rates below replacement level. These countries are home to 40% of the world's population. By the year 2015, an estimated two-thirds of all the people on earth will live in countries with birth rates at or below replacement level, which is 2.1 babies per woman.\n \n The Wall Street Journal in February of 1997 said, \"Villages left will be bereft of children, and schools will be closed for lack of students. If the human face of this population implosion is melancholy, do understand the economic consequences are nothing short of grim. Labor shortages will cramp production. Housing markets will grow moribund. This in turn will create a drag on real estate and other sectors of the countries.\"\n \n Global Redistribution\n \n Assuming that we will have a shrinking population, but with the decline much more rapid in the West than in the South, we will see a global redistribution of world population. At the present time, the ratio of population is approximately 4 in the underdeveloped nations to 1 in those more developed. But if these projections continue, by the year 2050, the ratio will be 7 to 1. For example, as of today, the ratio of the population of Europe, compared to Africa, is about 1 to 1. But in another 50 years, there will be three Africans for every one European.\n \n An Aging Population\n \n Aging will be another impact of de-population. In 1900, the median age of the world's population was around 20 years. Today it's about 25. But with the continuing drastic reduction in birth rates, the aging population will raise the median age to 40 years by 2050.\n \n \n In some countries, it will be much worse. In Japan, the median age will be 53, Germany 55 and Italy 58 - and there won't be many children. Another way of looking at it is, if these population trends continue, in another 50 years there will be three times as many old people as young children in the lesser developed nations, but in the West the ratio will be 8 to 1. To take the most extreme example, if Italy's reproductive rate stays at 1.2 (you need 2.1 to replace), by the year 2050 only 2% of Italians will be under five years of age, but 40% will be over 65.\n \n \n http://www.lifeissues.org/connector/98jan.html\n \n \n \n just so you know Eddie. I don't make things up. I dont' state facts unless they are facts (even if they're disputed).",

   "Not to mention that none of it even remotely explains why lesbians are just as descriminated against, just as denied rights, just as rejected by society. Lesbians have the LOWEST transmission rates of most STD's including HIV. \n \n Straight men can be just as promiscuous as gay men. It's just more accepted because they're straight.\n Promiscuity has very little to do with the whole societal rejection thing. \n It's simply that straights are obsessed with what everyone else   is doing behind closed doors.\n\n Justine is correct,there is no real evidence that gay men are more promiscuos than straight men. This is a myth. Studies have already shown that this is true. So why are we looking at the reason gay men are more promiscuos when it isn't true in the first place.\n \n From link:\n 3) Homosexuals are no more promiscuous or predatory than heterosexuals\n There is an extant myth, propagated by the Christian Right, that homosexuals engage in highly promiscuous behavior. Granted, there are some homosexuals that do engage in such behavior. But there are heterosexuals that do the same thing. What is important to recognize is the substantial heterosexist bias that causes people to ignore heterosexual flaws while highlighting homosexual flaws.\n a) One study which appears to support the idea that homosexuals are highly promiscuous was published by Bell and Weinberg, and is often cited by the Christian Right, and even some secular sources. However, their data is highly suspicious, and cannot be generalized to the entire homosexual population. Because of their methodology, their data is valuable only as a case study for the sample they studied, but it is not by any means representative of the general gay population. See Appendix A for my specific critique of this study, and why their statistics on gay promiscuity are so bizarrely high. \n \n b) In a study of sexual behavior in homosexuals and heterosexuals, the researchers found that of gay and bisexual men, 24% had one male partner in their lifetime, 45% had 2-4 male partners, 13% had 5-9 male partners, and 18% had 10 or more sexual partners, which produces a mean of less than 6 partners. (The statistics I did by myself using the data presented, which is presented as a percentage of total males interviewed, both gay and straight (p. 345)--they can be verified yourself by looking at the numbers given in the paper)(Fay; n=97 gay males of 1450 males total). In a parallel study, a random sample of primarily straight men (n=3111 males who had had vaginal intercourse; of the total sample of n=3224 males, only 2.3% had indicated having had sex with both men and women), the mean number of sexual partners was 7.3, with 28.2% having 1-3 partners, and 23.3% having greater than 19 partners (Billy). This data indicates that gay men may have fewer number of sexual partners than heterosexuals. \n \n J Billy-1993: Family Planning Perspectives 25:52-60 \n R Fay-1989, Science 243:338-348\n \n In another set of studies, the first (n=2664) showed that gay men had an average of 6.5 sexual partners in the past 5 years. In fact, the authors of this paper report that \"homosexual and bisexual men are much more likely than heterosexual men to be celibate\" given the data in the table below, which compares their data to a second, parallel study of only heterosexual men (n=1235, age=18-49 yrs). The table indicates the percentage of men having the given number of sexual partners in the previous year [top row: Binson; bottom row: Dolcini]: \n \n orientation no partners 1 partner 2+ partners \n gay 24 % 41 % 35 % \n straight 8 % 80 % 12 % \n \n \n D Binson-1995: Journal of Sex Research 32: 245-54.\n M Dolcini-1993: Family Planning Perspectives 25: 208-14.\n \n A third major study, by Laumann, appears on the surface to indicate that gay men do have many more sexual partners than heterosexual men. However, a more extensive analysis of the data gives a more balanced perspective. Laumann fails to explore the radically skewed nature of the data. Typically this indicates that the mean, the statistic presented by Laumann, may not be the best measure to report. A further analysis of the GSS data (on which Laumann based his results) indicates that the median (50th percentile) number of sexual partners for heterosexuals is five and for homosexuals is six (http://www.jeramyt.org/gss/partners.html). The discrepancy between the mean and median is indicative of a small sub-population of gay males who tend towards high rates of sexual partners, skewing the mean, while the majority of gay men tend to have rates about the same as heterosexual males. \n \n Laumann, Edward, et al.

   "Justine is correct,there is no real evidence that gay men are more promiscuos than straight men. This is a myth. Studies have already shown that this is true. \n\n \n Homosexual Promiscuity\n \"Marriage Forum Fact Sheet - Homosexuality\"\n Promiscuity is the factor that leads to health problems and monetary costs cited below. \n Prior to the AIDS epidemic, a 1978 study found that 75 percent of white, gay males claimed to have had more than 100 lifetime male sex partners: 15 percent claimed 100-249 sex partners; 17 percent claimed 250-499; 15 percent claimed 500- 999; and 28 percent claimed more than 1,000 lifetime male sex partners. Levels of promiscuity subsequently declined, but some observers are concerned that promiscuity is again approaching the levels of the 1970s. \n In more recent years, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control has reported an upswing in promiscuity, at least among young homosexual men in San Francisco. From 1994 to 1997, the percentage of homosexual men reporting multiple partners and unprotected anal sex rose from 23.6 percent to 33.3 percent, with the largest increase among men under 25.7 AIDS no longer seems to deter individuals from engaging in promiscuous gay sex. \n Monogamy, meaning long-term sexual fidelity, is rare in GLB relationships, particularly among gay men. One study reported that 66 percent of gay couples reported sex outside the relationship within the first year, and nearly 90 percent if the relationship lasted five years. \n \u00b7 A1998 study in Seattle found that 10 percent of HIV-positive men admitted they engaged in unprotected anal sex, and the percentage doubled in 2000. According to a study of men who attend gay \"circuit\" parties, the danger at such events is even greater. Ten percent of the men surveyed expected to become HIV-positive in their lifetime. Researchers discovered that 17 percent of the circuit party attendees surveyed were already HIV positive. Two thirds of those attending circuit parties had oral or anal sex, and 28 percent did not use condoms.\n \u00b7 Studies show that 75-90 percent of women who have sex with women have also had sex with men. And the average gay or lesbian relationship is short lived. In one study, only 15 percent of gay men and 17.3 percent of lesbians had relationships that lasted more than three years. Most of the above facts taken from The Health Risks of Gay Sex by John R. Digs, Jr. M.D. which has 129 footnotes and hundreds of sources, many from Center of Disease Control.. http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/homosexuality/ho0075.html\n In Their Own Words - Promiscuity Quotes by Homosexuals\n Gay author Gabriel Rotello, \"Let me simply say that I have no moral objection to promiscuity...I enjoyed the '70's, I didn't think there was anything morally wrong with the lifestyle of the baths. I believe that for many people, promiscuity can be meaningful, liberating and fun.\" http://www.narth.com/docs/whyreveal.html. He also says, \"Gay liberation was founded . . . on a 'sexual brotherhood of promiscuity,' and any abandonment of that promiscuity would amount to a 'communal betrayal of gargantuan proportions. http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/homosexuality/ho0075.html \n Signorile, another well known homosexual advocating safe sex, speaks of the \"raunchy, impersonal atmosphere\" of sex in public parks and bathrooms, \"There's nothing morally wrong with this--and I say that as someone who has certainly had my share of hot public sex, beginning when I was a teenager and well into my adulthood.\"http://www.nogaymarriage.com/talkingpoints.html.\" \n Bisexual website: \" [T]he hottest campus flicker of the moment is rompy Threesome, the jingle of which probably sums up the idea behind the new way of viewing life best: \"One girl, two boys, three possibilities... the next object of your admiration could just as well be a male as a female\" \"The New Bi-standers\" http://www.biwebsites.com/article1.html \n \u00b7 From a gay website:\"Polyamory (many loves) is a relatively new word created for relationships where an adult intimately loves more than one other adult.

   "First off it's bad public policy. It's like the government legalizing alcohol and tobacco. Now because of that many other harmful things are trying to be approved because of the precedent of alcohol and tobacco.\n\n \n This is the slippery slope argument, you mean? That if homosexuality is legalized, then other, actually harmful things will be legalized? Well, I would in turn argue that if homosexuality remains in danger, we are in a much greater danger of falling down a slippery slope. This is because there really is no good reason to deny same-sex marriage; denying it is an incredible denial of freedom. We are likely to fall down the path of denying more freedoms if we succeed in denying same-sex marriage. Who is to say that badmouthing politicians should not be illegal? We will have already proven that it is acceptable for the government to deny freedom. We should not start down that path; it is a far more dangerous and far more likely path than any one same-sex marraige would lead us down.\n \n More importantly, it is morally wrong to deny freedom and equality do a set of individuals simply because you are afraid someone else might as for too much. The correct course of action is always to treat others fairly and fight that which is wrong when it shows its face. If you have a reason that same-sex marriage should be made legal, that is one thing, but the argument that legalizing same-sex marriage will lead us down a slippery slope is in itself not a valid argument.\n \n \nSecond it will promote the behavior. By sanctioning homosexuality it will encourage or at elast enable the behavior that is detrimental. It will basically be promoting the behavior and make people struggling with it less likely to seek treatment.\n\n \n It is not quite promoting the behavior, for it is putting that lifestyle on a even ground. It is simply not discouraging the lifestyle. And unless any very good reason can be provided why it should be discouraged, it should not be discouraged. Although less may be likely to seek treatment, unless it can be figured to be harmful in some way, it is just as unreasonable to want homosexuals to seek treatment as it is to want Christians to seek treatment.\n \n \nThird it would put more of a strain on health care by forcing insurers to either drop spouses or insure less healthy behaviors.\n\n \n This is only the case if homosexual sex can be considered less healthy than heterosexual sex. I will argue that it is in fact no less healthy and probably far less costly to insurance companies. The reason for this is that those engaged in same-sex marriages would be very unlikely to be engaging in irresponsible sex, which means they have zero chance at developing an STD. Although there may be some minor health issues which sometimes result from male-male sex, these are largely preventable, merely inconvenient, and do not require treatment. They are far less expensive than covering the costs of child birth, which would be less common in same-sex couples.\n \n It could also be claimed that any additional burden on the insurance companies would be a harm, and even though same-sex couples might require less medical insurance than opposite-sex couples, they are still an additional burden. Yet this claim fails to realize that each additional opposite-sex marriage hurts insurance companies just as much as each additional same-sex couple would, and that the problem, if this could be considered a problem, exists already today. It is a problem caused by marriage as a whole, not by same-sex marriage. If one could argue that same-sex couples should be allowed to marry if insurance companies are allowed to choose what types of families to cover, then it is not same-sex marriage one has a problem with.\n \n \nThe list goes on but that will do for now.\n \n With respect to detriments of homosexuality. Put out your criteria for information and I will post the information about the detriments of gay behaviors. I've doen it in the past and everyone dismisses it becasue of the study was flawed, etc. So name the criteria and I'll post the information.\n\n \n My criteria is: any negative effect on society or on individuals caused by legalizing same-sex marriage. You can claim that it does not discourage homosexuality, but I will ask why it should be discouraged. You can claim homosexuality is unhealthy, but that would need to be something which specifically outweighs the benefits of marriage and is rooted in legalizing same-sex marriage. I should warn you that if you simply use statistics to show that homosexuality causes people's lives to be shorter, I will attribute that to a subculture of homosexuals which engages in irresponsible sex and other activities. I will further explain that the average homosexual lives just as long as a heterosexual if you don't factor in that subculture and that legalizing same-sex marriage is the best way to discourage that irresponsible behavior. Remember that although statistics never lie, they do not speak for themselves.\n \n \nSo most gay promisicuity in Mass has declined becasue of gay marriage? There is a significat delcine in that behavior in Mass, sufficient to support outweight the disadvantages?\n\n \n Considering that there have been no disadvantages, yes. Also, it would not be reasonable to expect immediate results. Those who have engaged in an irresponsible lifestyle for their entire lives aren't going to immediately change that simply because marriage is legalized. It is with future generations who realize that society wishes to include them, that society has a place for them in a monogamous relationship, who will be saved from harm.\n \n \nYeah but he used words that did relate to it.\n\n \n Only if you have a different verse or if you feel that promiscuity or unnatural sex refers to homosexuality, which is an illogical assumption.",

   "Among homosexual men in particular, casual sex, rather than committed relationships, is the rule and not the exception. And even when they do enter into a more committed relationship, it is usually of relatively short duration. For example, a study of homosexual men in the Netherlands (the first country in the world to legalize \"marriage\" for same-sex couples), published in the journal AIDS in 2003, found that the average length of \"steady partnerships\" was not more than 2 < years (Maria Xiridou et al., in AIDS 2003, 17:1029-1038).\n \n In addition, studies have shown that even homosexual men who are in \"committed\" relationships are not sexually faithful to each other. While infidelity among heterosexuals is much too common, it does not begin to compare to the rates among homosexual men. The 1994 National Health and Social Life Survey, which remains the most comprehensive study of Americans' sexual practices ever undertaken, found that 75 percent of married men and 90 percent of married women had been sexually faithful to their spouse. On the other hand, a major study of homosexual men in \"committed\" relationships found that only seven out of 156 had been sexually faithful, or 4.5 percent. The Dutch study cited above found that even homosexual men in \"steady partnerships\" had an average of eight \"casual\" sex partners per year.\n \n www.ncfpc.org/PolicyPapers/\n\n \n I could not view the link you provided for some reason, but I am pretty certain it is useless. First, 156 gay people surveyed is an incredibly small number of people, which is clearly not representative. Next, I do not deny the existence of a subculture of gay men who is promiscuous, but they are in no way the majority. Since that subculture is most visible and accessible, it is very likely that for convenience, the members of that study were completely from this subculture.\n \n A bit of investigation on this theory reveals that it is likely true. Take a look at this link:\n \n http://www.amptoons.com/blog/archives/2003/08/\n \n One of the entries here evaluates the method in which Xiridou obtained her information about gay men. It was not from her own surveys but from gathered from an earlier study called the Amsterdam Cohort Study which began in 1984, and which began by advertising in a gay newspaper and through word of mouth, asking for homosexual men who had at least two sexual partners in the past year. It should be clear that this sort of study would be very likely to attract only the most promiscuous.\n \n The truth is that the entire study is wrong. I know over thirty gay people, not one of whom has ever had eight sexual partners in a year. I can only think of one or two who might have had eight sexual partners in their entire lives, and I'd suspect that they haven't. Half of them couldn't even find two sexual partners in a year if they wanted to, let alone eight. Actually, probably a third are virgins who are having trouble finding even one person they want to be with (and who resist my efforts to try to hook them up with one another). Promiscuity is far higher in my heterosexual friends.\n \n Though my experience lies mostly with the gay group in my college, gay rights activist groups, gay recreational clubs, and a Guerrilla bar of gay people who gather at random bars in Detroit. This is a very different crowd than the gay clubs crowd. There are many people who are gay and who know gay people on this forum. Do any of you know people who fit into Xiridou's description of gay people?",

I don't think you can generalize that a promiscuos celeb, with or without protection, has a higher risk factor or infection rate than gay men, promiscuous or non-promiscuous with or without protection. \n \n Whenever someone gets this disease, it is a tragedy, regardless of who the person is. In some places it emerged in the gay community, and has got a strong foothold there. This may have happened because there isn't the tradition of using condoms in the gay community, there wasn't when this disease first emerged. Condoms were used by straight people to prevent pregnancy, and gay men couldn't become pregnant. Few people thought to use condoms to prevent diseases that were far less harmful than AIDS.\n \n I don't think we need this judgment of certain groups, regardless of their statistics on diseases. There are higher statistical rates of HIV when comaring groups based on race and income level. Are we to judge individuals in those groups, as a group, saying how dare you be suffering from this disease more than my group is? That makes you an immoral group of people?",

For one thing, a woman may not know if her partner has sex with with men, so you aren't going to be able to identify them as a group. Secondly, two uninfected men, if they are monogamous, are extremely low risk. Three, exclusely heterosexual men are not low risk (they may be lower risk than other groups), and their risk level depends upon their partners (as does all the other groups). Exclusively lesbian women (I know it's redundant) are indeed the lowest risk group, but that is only without other qualifiers. You thow drug abusers, particularly those that share needles, into the mix, everyone's risk levels go up.\n \n In Africa and the Caribbean (I am not sure about other parts of the world), the disease is spread more easily through heterosexual intercourse, because the strains of the virus is different than the one that is infecting people here in North America and Western Europe (I'll have to dig up the research).

   "Someone comparing rock stars and celebrities to the promiscuity rates of gay men is using a flawed comparison, for this promiscuity could only be reasonably compared to the subculture of gay men who engages in irresponsible sex. Then again, there are certainly some rock stars and celebrities who are not promiscuous, though I doubt that percentage is as high as the percentage of gay men who are not promiscuous.\n\n \n My only point with the reference to basketball players and celebrities was to dispell the ridiculous idea that this society ostracizes the sexually promiscuous, at least the men. We may not like our upstairs neighbor being a lothario or our grandson being slutty, but this culture actually lionizes men who have a lot of sexual conquests and we acknowledge that one of the rewards of success is easy access to sex.\n \n Perhaps it isn't pretty, but it IS pretty obvious.",

That's kind of obvious.\n \n \n \nThey show by example and belief that marital relationships are transitory and mostly sexual in nature.\n\n \n Hold on a second. Where did we/gays and lesbians gain this knowledge/understanding/concept of \"marital relationships\" anyway? \n \n Could it possibly be from those who are legally recognized as being married? Could it be from the lack of \"sanctity\" displayed by HETEROSEXUALS? \n Or how about the fact that straight couples keep telling us that marriage isn't for us, we aren't meant to be married, our relationships aren't as meaningful, aren't as real as theirs? \n \n Gee, I don't know, if you keep telling a child as it grows up that they are ugly and no one will ever love them that child will grow up lonely and angry and will lash out against conventional ideas of love. \n We are a product of your own greed, your own vile hatred, your own mean spirits. Our lack of reverance for long term committed relationships is a direct effect of our consistently being told our relationships don't matter. \n \n \n \n Sexual relationships are primarily for pleasure rather than procreation.\n\n \n Oh honey, we didn't come up with that concept. \n \n \n Monogamy is the exception, rather than the rule, in homosexual relationships.\n\n \n \n And you wonder why....tsk, tsk. emoticon_rolleyes",
