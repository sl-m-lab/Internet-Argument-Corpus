   "... As you said it is a debating forum and you have stated that Christians believe in fairy tales. Have you the proof they are fairy tales?\n\n Oh, go on then. I'll show you mine if you promise to show me that God exists. Deal?\n \n I'll start with a very recent quote just above from (your compatriot,) jyoshu (my bold):\n \nIn the absence of very clear and obvious evidence on any historical event or figure (and there are many such examples), what truly determines whether or not something has \"fairy tale status\" or not is whether or not a great many people believe it to be true. Until it is clearly disproven that the evidence we have (the synoptic biogrphapical writings about Jesus) is not true, then I don't see how we can honestly give it fairy tale status. No one truly believes the tooth fairy is real. (Well, except maybe for some little children.) But billions--yes billions of people--believe that there is a God and many believe they have experienced it in some way to some degree. On that discrepancy alone, the comparison is rendered invalid...\n\n So, there is an admitted correlation between absence of very clear and obvious evidence on any historical event or figure, a need to clearly disprove (quite wrong, as you well know), and the fact that numbers of believers gives credence. Truly, the comparison is rendered valid.\n \n How many examples do you want where it can be shown that millions/billions of believers in a particular issue were wrong? You know what they are anyway. The same numbers believing in God/gods doesn't make them right in FACT. There are plenty of web sites dedicated to Bible errancy: likely you have visited some and dismissed every last discrepancy. But tell me, by what authority do some Christians believe the Genesis account to be literal in time frame, and others believe it as allegorical? Why the discrepancy if it is the word of God and you are imbued with the Spirit to discern it?\n \n And so it is with the rest of the Bible. So many discrepancies, some people cleaving to it and believing it to be allegorical, others not so, so much myth and legend, even mortal man deciding what constitutes the Bible et al. And so much of it unproven and untestified.\n \n So, when a book is based on myth and legend and scantily little independant evidence for such monumental issues, with good guys and a bad guys, the battles between good and evil, and all living happily ever after, that's just a sword and sorcery fairy tale.\n \n That must be good and reliable evidence, because I'm sure millions feel the same as me. Anyway, your turn to prove God exists in FACT.",

Non-believers can't disprove God, but then it's not incumbent upon them to do so unless they assert that there is no God. As Dawkins states, there is insufficient evidence to show that God exists. And that point has been given to Christians many times on forums such as this.\n \n So, in the absence of Christians producing evidence to show beyond all reasonable doubt on such monumental issues that God exists and the Bible is trustworthy (and it is incumbent upon them), what is one to conclude?",

Moses received sacrifice, he didn't give anything up.\n \n The current controlling members to any cult, can even over ride the rules of the leaders before them. The examples are numerous. One of my favorite examples is Christianity and its initial concepts of Communism. The founder of the cult, Jesus clearly had issues with money. He would not even touch it. Only one member of the original group was even allowed to carry money. The First Church was communal, communistic. This was modified by the leaders that followed Jesus. In fact; today most Christians believe communism stands against Christianity which is clearly a dream. The only church in Russia was the Russian Orthodox Church, a Christian church. \n \n The only religion that can not be used to establish a fighting force is Buddhism. Its very hard to justify war if all living things have great value. Didn't stop many from doing just that but the faith seems to always fall back to the original teachings unlike the Christian faith which nearly has no connections at all with the original teachings of the founder.

   " The last thing any Christian Church leader is going to do is take up his cross. He is far to busy watching the stock market and getting people to send him money. The last thing a Pat Robertson would want to see is a second coming of a Christ. The thought is entertaining to say the least, I would love to see Pat explain the need for an airport in his back yard while he freely takes the last dime from so many fixed income people.\n\n \n Giving Pat Robertson as an example of a Christian leader is ridiculous. Try Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Maximillian Kolbe, Oscar Romero, Janani Luwum as examples from this century of Christian leaders who have taken up their cross and died for it. Christian leaders in the Anglican and Catholic traditions are usually on a fixed income themselves.",

   "Dietrich Bonhoeffer died in 1945.\n \n Bonhoeffer readily acknowledged \"the debt he owes to liberal theology.\" Declaring that it was impossible to know the objective truth about Christ's real nature and essence, Bonhoeffer proclaimed that God was dead. Moreover, Bonhoeffer believed that the true Christian was the confessing believer who totally immersed his life in the secular world, becoming a secular Christian. Rejecting the objective unalterable moral standards of the Bible, Bonhoeffer proclaimed a situational ethics concept.\n \n Clearly Dietrich supports my claims and to many, Dietrich would be considered a non-Christian. Because he rose above the dogma and allowed himself to think. God shall confound the wise, so only a fool may enter. This man was wise.\n \n Maximillian Kolbe took the names Maximilian Maria, to show his veneration of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Which clearly is a modern Christian concept with no connection to the original founders.\n \n Oscar Romero;\n \"God needs the people themselves,\" he said, \"to save the world . Thats a secular attitude is it not? I agree completely with him. But I missed the second coming part.\n \n Janani Luwum was shot by Idi Amin, and all the examples you gave are dead.\n \n Good men? Clearly. But what made them good men was their ability to think for them selfs. They determined what was good or bad and acted. None of them claimed some hidden knowledge or had any real control over a people. They where crushed by the dogma of the flock attitude and refused to become one. They rejected the leaderships of their respective areas and rose above flock mentality to become human beings. Not cattle! In doing so, I would indeed call them Holy. They decided that giving unto Caesar had a price that, for them was to great to bare. Yes; they died for it, and to those that can understand what true love is, they are worthy of admiration. But their actions wouldn't allie them with any religious movement. They rose above that and doing so became sons of God. \n \n No faith can do that. You can not pray \"Our father\" and call Jesus the only son of God. Religion doesn't work if you are to be a son of a God. You can't take up your cross and follow after it. The Dogma fails every time. You can only find God in yourself and no man or book or Preacher will get you any closer to a real God than the lottery would. \n \n All faiths are flawed and I think you know that in your heart. A God does not choose one family over many to be a chosen people, If he did, The men you proclaim waisted their lives. As so many lives where waisted by the flocks of believers that cover the pages of the bible. God did NOT order Joshua to kill every man woman and child in three cites so a select number of relatives could have their homes. It can not be from a loving God. The measure a heart has for a God fails. And if your willing to sacrifice your child by command of a God your no better than a Bal worshiper, no mater how you rationalize it. Love does not destroy the things close to its heart. Choose Hell and find Heaven. Noses rings are unbecoming, they are fine for cattle but hard on a spirit.",
