   "A Comanche Patriot Tries to Save the White Man\n \n \"As an Indian, I feel it is my sacred honor to save the white man again, this time, from himself,\" says Dr. David A. Yeagley, who holds a divinity degree from Yale. \"Before he gives this country away, thus defeating me twice, I want to try to save what he built out of my land.\"\n \n Indians saved the white man before, says Yeagley, when they helped the first settlers get established. Now they must save him again, this time from political correctness.\n \n \"White guilt is the biggest flaw in the American psyche,\" warns Yeagley.\n \n As a Comanche, Yeagley feels no guilt over his ancestors' deeds. \"They were the lords of the south plains,\" he says. \"They kicked out all the other Indians. They had no tolerance for other Indians, no tolerance for white people, no tolerance for anybody except themselves.\"\n \n Comanche elders have been instilling that warrior spirit in their young, for centuries, through the stories and customs of their ancestors.\n \n Unfortunately, says Yeagley, white Americans have failed to do the same. The fighting spirit that built this country has been allowed to fade.\n \n Full article:\n \n http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/Printable.asp?ID=779\n \n \n What's Up With White Women?\n \n by David A. Yeagley\n \n \"Look, Dr, Yeagley, I don't see anything about my culture to be proud of. It's all nothing. My race is just nothing.\"\n \n The girl was white. She was tall and pretty, with amber hair and brown eyes. For convenience' sake, let's call her \"Rachel.\"\n \n I had been leading a class on social psychology, in which we discussed patriotism - what it means to be a people or a nation. The discussion had been quite lively. But when Rachel spoke, everyone fell silent.\n \n \"Look at your culture,\" she said to me. \"Look at American Indian tradition. Now I think that's really great. You have something to be proud of. My culture is nothing.\"\n \n On the surface, she was paying me a compliment. She was praising my Indian culture, at the expense of her own. Why, then, did it feel so much like a slap in the face?\n \n They say that a warrior is measured by the strength of his enemies. As an Indian, I am proud of the fact that it took the mightiest nation on earth to defeat me.\n \n Full article:\n \n http://www.badeagle.com/html/white_women.html\n \n \n Related Threads:\n \n Critical Facts that You Need to Know\n \n Top Ten Reasons to Close America's Border\n \n \n \n .",

   "I too oppose white guilt. So I agree with the engine on that matter. Where we seem to disagree is with his ownership of the land. So his people migrated here first, big deal. He was not created here any more than the white man was, so why does he claim ownership of the land? His people moved in and took it from the wilderness. \n \n His claim of ownersship may be accurate if we lived in a world of \"first come first serve\" but we don't. We live in a world where the biggest gun takes possession. He was right on the money about white guilt. I'll give him credit there.",

If you have the biggest antlers and know how to use them then you get the doe and the territory. Same goes for fish. Same for bear and the same for humans. We know how to build a better antler. \n \n So yeah, I think it was okay. When someone builds a better antler, they will take it away from us and they will do it without regard to your feelings.

   "Socities compete on more levels than just with strength of arms, of cause it helps if you had the biggest gun to start with but ask yourself why isn't murder, rape and theft OK? \n Answer (bar some supernatural being threatening you so you don't do it) is because you don't want someone to do it to you, and this can be done two ways - either getting the biggest gun for yourself or living with a whole group of like minded people who have smaller but easily combined guns. The whole 'white guilt' come from having commited acts against people in the past you would not want commited against you and being part of a group that thinks the same, its just now the descendants of the 'wronged' people are now part of the group. No reason really to feel guilty, you personally had nothing to do with it, but then likewise feeling proud of past actions is equally pointless.\n Feeling that you would proud of the native american culture is just saying that you share some values with them, and like to irritate white supremists",
