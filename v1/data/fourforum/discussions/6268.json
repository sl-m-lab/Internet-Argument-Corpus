   "In a few weeks, September 14th, Massachusetts will be holding its second Constitutional convention on gay marriage. In Mass., to amend the constitution, two consecutive conventions must approve the amendment, and then it goes to the voters. The current belief is that it doesn't have much chance of passing. Says House Speaker DiMasi, \"''Everybody anticipates that there won't be enough votes to pass this. 'That seems to be pretty clear.\"\n \n If/when the amendment dies I suspect that will be the practicle end to attempts to overturn gay marriage in Massachusetts. Gays have been getting married for a year, without the world coming to an end. There's simply no justification to take thousands of happily married people and tell them that they're not married any more. There will still be some groups working towards just that, but I see no way that they'll be able to avoid be labeled as haters, pushing a harmful agenda that benefits no one.",

   "Well they should be labeled haters and they are pushing an agenda that is just plain wrong. Currently in Mass. Gay and lesbian families have the protection and legal status of marriage. What would be the benefit of taking that away? So a bunch of people are no longer protected? That would be wrong. \n \n Those who advocate that gay marriage will destroy the institution do so with no logical arguments. They try so hard to make the argument look real, but it isn't. Mass is just another example along with Canada, that gay marriage is a good thing, not the end all of marriage.\n \n I myself am going to marry my partner of almost 6 years in just a few weeks. It isn't legal for me, but none the less, We are doing it anyway.....I only hope that the 1913 law that bars out of state weddings in Mass in found to be unconstitutional so I can cross the border (a ten minute drive for me) and make my union legal!",

In the case of gay marriage, there really is an element of prejudice present among some of them. But abortion is not a prejudice issue.\n\n \n I too think abortion and gay rights to be very seperate issues. In my opinion, there are a lot of good reasons to disallow abortion, and there are a lot of good reasons to allow abortion. This is the case in most debates. However, in the case of gay rights, I don't believe that there is even a single logical reason to oppose giving gay people the same access to marriage that we give straight people.\n \n In the case of abortion, it could be argued that human lives are being saved. That, if correct, is a good reason; if that's correct, then abortion causes incredible harm; it kills. It's difficult to say where the line between human and reproductive material should be drawn, but there are good arguments on both sides.\n \n In the case of same-sex marriage, the arguments against it are, \"We'd have to redefine a word\" (though redefining a word isn't harmful in any way) or \"I just don't believe homosexuality is moral\" (which is advocating imposing one's own religion into the law when no real harm exists) or \"homosexuality is harmful\" (which isn't true) or \"gay parents aren't the ideal parents\" (which is neither true, nor does it matter since they're unquestionably better than no parents) or some argument based on prejudices of some sort. Those are not rational arguments.\n \n And furthermore, same-sex marriage is certainly guaranteed by the Constitution while the right to an abortion is, in my opinion, not clearly present in the Constitution.",
