   "You need to go back and read the article more closely. It clearly says \n \"And a month before that, Obama mentioned Jesus' Sermon on the Mount at Georgetown University to make the case for his economic policies.\"\n\n \n I suggest you just drop the whole argument. \n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/14/us/politics/14obama-text.html?pagewanted=8&_r=1\n \n While there are references to it, Obama never comes out and actually directly cites the sermon itself. He only mentions \"house upon a rock\" and does not cite the Bible either. If one wasn't religious, one wouldn't know where he got the reference from. He does not come out and state, the Sermon on the Mount says... He does not come out and say the Bible teaches us...He does not come out and say anything like Bush did. \n \n Tell me, how is that the same as directly involving religious leaders in planning science funding? How is that the same as directly funding religious groups and programs Bush wanted? How is that the same as pandering to his base which essentially rejects modern science? How is that the same as deliberately suppressing science to get religious votes? How is that the same as saying GOD TOLD ME TO INVADE? \n \n \nSee, they BOTH use religion to justify their policies.\n\n \n Depends how you define justify. But you still ignore my fundamental argument. \n \n People got ###### at Bush for directly using religion in crafting policy. Obama has yet to do that. I noticed you ignored that part in my previous post. Bush justified invading Iraq because God told him. How is that the same as Obama using a biblical reference to analogize his policies in economic terms? The metaphor makes sense. All Obama did was argue that here are the economic reasons why we should do it and how it serves as the foundation of our economy. How is that the same as God told me to do it?\n \n \nYou just prefer one's policy over the other, and so you turn a blind eye to one's use of his religion but not the other. The hypocrisy here is you not applying a consistent standard for criticism.\n\n \n Apparently my posts deriding the stimulus don't count. Just easier for you to pretend I actually like him. Dishonesty again eh? You hang out with Arch way too much.\n \n LOL. Really. Care to address anything I actually said?\n \n Why would someone who got angry at Bush for using religion in crafting, producing and making policy be angry at Obama for using religion to get his otherwise religion free agenda through? \n \n You still haven't addressed that. And I suspect you won't. Both Archangel and I agree that Obama is using religion as nothing more than a facade. How is that the SAME as Bush who used in actual policy production? \n \n Why would anyone who is consistent get angry on the basis of using religion in policy get angry over someone who did not use religion in policy? \n \n \nAlso, stop with the knee-jerk accusations of 'dishonesty'. Such accusations are nothing more than a form of ad hominem here.\n\n \n You are dishonest. You are arguing that those who got ###### off at Bush for using religion in policy production are hypocrites for not getting angry at Obama who uses religion for nothing more than essential deceit on evanglicals. \n \n Why would anyone get angry at Obama when he is NOT using religion in the manner that they were annoyed at Bush for? \n \n Candidate A does activity B you don't like\n Do you get angry at Candidate B who does activity C for the same reasons?\n \n No. You don't.\n \n When Obama starts using religion directly in making policy, when Obama starts funding religious programs he wants, when Obama deliberately suppresses science to get evanglical votes, then you have an argument.

I also linked the full text of his speech. If you bothered to read it, it does not actually cite the sermon by name and uses the analogy as nothing more than an analogy. The arguments given are entirely non-biblical.\n \n \nThere's nothing wrong with EITHER of them doing it.\n\n \n Irrelevant to the subject. You dishonestly tried to argue that those who were angry at Bush for crafting policy by incorporating religion are hypocrites for not being angry at Obama who says Christ a lot. No one who got angry at Bush for using religion in making policy is a hypocrite for not getting angry at Obama for using religion to hoodwink Evangelicals into accepting it. As Archangel pointed out, Obama's agenda is secular. Bush's was not. Why the hell would someone who was angry at Bush for using religion in policy making get angry at someone who just says Christ a lot but otherwise ignores religion in making policy? You have yet to answer that question despite being asked that at least five different times so far. \n \n \nSeparation of church and state doesn't mean religious moral beliefs can't be an influence--it's impossible to avoid that, and unreasonable to expect anyone other than an agnostic or an atheist to not let religiously moralistic belief be an influence on them.\n\n \n How is Obama talking about Christ and the Sermon on the mount the same as rejecting Stem Cell Research on the basis of his religious beliefs? \n \n How is Obama talking about Christ and the Sermon on the mount the same as funding faith based programs that empirically do not work?\n \n How is Obama talking about Christ and the Sermon on the mount the same as gutting science from science policy to please one's voter base?\n \n You can pretend all you want that talking about Christ is the same as actually using religion in making policy, but you'd be dishonest. \n \n You are saying that hiding a secular agenda behind religion is the same as an agenda that has religious goals. \n \n That makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.

Clearly, I was wrong. \n \n \nBut don't act like one is bad while acting like the other case is somehow ok, just because you happen to prefer one set of policy views over the other.\n\n \n \n You know, outright refusing to actually address anything I wrote is not a way of winning an argument. \n \n \nIf someone is on record citing Jesus (Sermon on the Mount) as an influence on their POLICIES, then call a spade and spade and at least be consistent. You've got your head in the sand here.\n\n \n Actually all he said was \"build our house upon the rock.\" Nowhere in the speech except for the last paragraph (of 8 pages) is Christ mentioned. Furthermore, if you bothered to read his speech (which you clearly did not, thus rendering your argument an argument from ignorance), he focuses almost entirely upon the economic reasons for his policies. Nowhere did he argue anything like Bush did for why to stop funding for Stem Cell Research. Unlike Bush, who argued from a religious emotional perspective, Obama's argument was almost entirely economic. But your crackpot argument seems to think they are the same. Again, as both Arch and I agree (which is rare), Obama's use of religion at least in policy is nothing more than a facade to pull the wool over Evangelicals eyes. \n \n Good job on ignoring my entire argument.

There is also little doubt (in my mind) that he is doing anything more than pandering to people. I'd be shocked if he actually feels he should follow the Word of God. Bush I think actually tried to but really missed some key points...so in that sense he was more genuine but what good is that when you are wrong. \n \n I think this could be seen by Obama's \"make everyone happy\" style approach to being president. Tell the gay rights people one thing and then tell the church folks he \"personally\" thinks marriage is between a man and woman. \n \n So Obama may invoke it more but Foundit66 makes a good point that he doesn't really mean it because frankly I'm not sure what Obama really thinks. \n \n I kinda wish people would just really look at things and accept some truths about Bush and Obama.

But you do think Bush was?\"\n \n To answer this...Bush was genuine but he was just wrong on a number of different issues. I think Obama is very convincing that he has these firm beliefs but in reality he doesn't hold any of those views. He is a people pleaser and a people pleaser can't be a leader.",
