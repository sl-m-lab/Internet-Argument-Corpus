   "Fellow 4forum Posters,\n It is my misfortune that I am related to a lunatic by marriage (my grandmother's marriage to be precise). Her husband's theological and political ideas are remarkably humorous and disturbing because they are the ideas that he operates with on a daily basis. He recently sent me an e-mail (a VERY long rant) so rife with contradictions and regurgitated paranoia that I felt compelled to share it with others and extract their thoughts, musings, and even breakdowns of his obvious miscalculations. \n Though I be liberal, and the e-mail lecturer conservative (and our opinions so hard at odds that we haven't reason to claim comraderie on an atomic level) --I will share the e-mail below (private info. removed) for all members of the political/religious rainbow and ask that you mull, muse, laugh or cry, and proceed to articulate what disturbs or pleases you most. Your time and input is greatly appreciated.\n \n Now, enjoy!\n \n --iwakar\n \n P.S. I will include the original article that inspired his \"hemming and hawwing\".\n \n Onward, Moderate Christian Soldiers\n By JOHN C. DANFORTH \n Published: June 17, 2005\n St. Louis\n \n IT would be an oversimplification to say that America's culture wars are now between people of faith and nonbelievers. People of faith are not of one mind, whether on specific issues like stem cell research and government intervention in the case of Terri Schiavo, or the more general issue of how religion relates to politics. In recent years, conservative Christians have presented themselves as representing the one authentic Christian perspective on politics. With due respect for our conservative friends, equally devout Christians come to very different conclusions.\n \n It is important for those of us who are sometimes called moderates to make the case that we, too, have strongly held Christian convictions, that we speak from the depths of our beliefs, and that our approach to politics is at least as faithful as that of those who are more conservative. Our difference concerns the extent to which government should, or even can, translate religious beliefs into the laws of the state.\n \n People of faith have the right, and perhaps the obligation, to bring their values to bear in politics. Many conservative Christians approach politics with a certainty that they know God's truth, and that they can advance the kingdom of God through governmental action. So they have developed a political agenda that they believe advances God's kingdom, one that includes efforts to \"put God back\" into the public square and to pass a constitutional amendment intended to protect marriage from the perceived threat of homosexuality. \n \n Moderate Christians are less certain about when and how our beliefs can be translated into statutory form, not because of a lack of faith in God but because of a healthy acknowledgement of the limitations of human beings. Like conservative Christians, we attend church, read the Bible and say our prayers. \n \n But for us, the only absolute standard of behavior is the commandment to love our neighbors as ourselves. Repeatedly in the Gospels, we find that the Love Commandment takes precedence when it conflicts with laws. We struggle to follow that commandment as we face the realities of everyday living, and we do not agree that our responsibility to live as Christians can be codified by legislators.\n \n When, on television, we see a person in a persistent vegetative state, one who will never recover, we believe that allowing the natural and merciful end to her ordeal is more loving than imposing government power to keep her hooked up to a feeding tube.\n \n When we see an opportunity to save our neighbors' lives through stem cell research, we believe that it is our duty to pursue that research, and to oppose legislation that would impede us from doing so.\n \n We think that efforts to haul references of God into the public square, into schools and courthouses, are far more apt to divide Americans than to advance faith.\n \n Following a Lord who reached out in compassion to all human beings, we oppose amending the Constitution in a way that would humiliate homosexuals.\n \n For us, living the Love Commandment may be at odds with efforts to encapsulate Christianity in a political agenda. We strongly support the separation of church and state, both because that principle is essential to holding together a diverse country, and because the policies of the state always fall short of the demands of faith. Aware that even our most passionate ventures into politics are efforts to carry the treasure of religion in the earthen vessel of government, we proceed in a spirit of humility lacking in our conservative colleagues.\n \n In the decade since I left the Senate, American politics has been characterized by two phenomena: the increased activism of the Christian right, especially in the Republican Party, and the collapse of bipartisan collegiality. I do not think it is a stretch to suggest a relationship between the two. To assert that I am on God's side and you are not, that I know God's will and you do not, and that I will use the power of government to advance my understanding of God's kingdom is certain to produce hostility.\n \n By contrast, moderate Christians see ourselves, literally, as moderators. Far from claiming to possess God's truth, we claim only to be imperfect seekers of the truth. We reject the notion that religion should present a series of wedge issues useful at election time for energizing a political base. We believe it is God's work to practice humility, to wear tolerance on our sleeves, to reach out to those with whom we disagree, and to overcome the meanness we see in today's politics.\n \n For us, religion should be inclusive, and it should seek to bridge the differences that separate people. We do not exclude from worship those whose opinions differ from ours. Following a Lord who sat at the table with tax collectors and sinners, we welcome to the Lord's table all who would come. Following a Lord who cited love of God and love of neighbor as encompassing all the commandments, we reject a political agenda that displaces that love. Christians who hold these convictions ought to add their clear voice of moderation to the debate on religion in politics. \n \n John C. Danforth is an Episcopal minister and former Republican senator from Missouri.\n \n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n (His reply to the article in the form of an e-mail to me.)\n \n Hi ******,\n This is the first time I have ever heard of a Moderate Christian. We are all one in Christ(Gal.3:28) therefore I have never thought of a Christian in terms of moderation. I am familiar with the word but decided to look it up anyway to see how it might fit into Christianity. So here goes, moderate-not extreme or excessive; temperate in opinions, views, or behavior;inclined toward the average in size, extent, or quality; mediocre. Based on this Webster definition my first thoughts went to Revelation 3:14-16 concerning the lukewarm church.\"And to the angel of the church of the Lacodiceans write, These things say the Amen, the faithful and the True Witness, the Beginning of the creation of God. I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were cold or hot. So then because you are lukewarm and neither cold nor hot. I will vomit you out of my mouth.\" I have always understood that the moderate is one who sits on the fence and is led by which ever way the wind blows. If it is expedient to think according to the thought of the day, then so be it and if it is not then so be it. In other words a moderate then as a Christian may stand for what God word says one day if it is expedient(expediency for politicians is votes) and may not the next day if it doesn't suit his or her agenda. If it is a liberal agenda then that agenda will always come first over God's Word. (Surely it is not offensive to call one a liberal and to make statements I believe are true if in the article you sent compares so much the righteousness of the moderate Christian to the faults of the conservative Christian, RE \"we (the moderate Christian) proceed in a spirit of humility lacking in our conservative colleagues.\" \n Consider the homosexual issue. God said that a man should leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh, Gen. 2:24. The Apostle Paul said in 1Cor.6:9,10 \"Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators , nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites, nor thieves. nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God.\" So my question to you is how does a \"moderate Christian\" justify his or her stand on homosexual marriage? If this is so important then so is polygamy important. If one is ok then why not the other. Or why can't an adult marry a child or a father his daughter better than that a father marries his son. Better yet let's encourage marriage between a person and his or her dog. Throw it out to everybody. Don't make it so exclusive says the moderate. God is meaningless in our society today. It is not what God wants but what man wants.\n I noticed with interest how your article speaks of the \"moderate Christian\" who tries to obey Christ as Christ quotes Leviticus 19:18 found in Matt. 5:43 \"that you should love your neighbor as yourself \" but fails to notice in the context of Leviticus, Leviticus 20:13 just a few verses over, \"If a man lies with a male as he lies with a women, both of them have committed an abomination. They shall surely be put to death. Their blood shall be upon them. \" You see he ignores it because it doesn't fit his agenda and would lose for him the homosexual vote but pays attention to Matt 5:43 because it gives him a feeling of loftiness and conscience healing and he can throw all of his Biblical failures into this one arena of \"love\" and thus soothe his conscience for his political achievements as he bathes in and adores his piety of the moderate behavior patterns. (See the last sentence of your article of the 10th paragraph.) See how he sits on the fence and waits for the wind to blow and the winds blows him to the left due to the expediency of maintaining the homosexual vote and others who support their agenda. As a Christian he has the opportunity to stand with God on these principles but refuses and so adopts the characteristics of the lukewarm moderate church of the Lacodiceans of which God says because of their lukewarmness neither hot or cold God will spew them out of His mouth Rev.3:14-16.\n Summarizing, the Bible says homosexuality is an abomination for a man to lie with a man as with a woman, or a woman to lie with a woman as with a man (Lev. 18:22;20:13). The Bible says that because of certain abominations such as homosexuality. a land will vomit out its inhabitants(Lev.18:25). The apostle Paul called it \"shameful\", the results of being given up by God to \"vile passions\" Rom. 1:24-27.\n In the Old Testament, those who practiced these things were removed from the congregation of Israel by execution.. We are told in the New Testament that those who practice homosexuality will not enter into the kingdom of God (1Cor. 6:9,10). The apostle Paul shows homosexuality as a final order of rebellion against God. When people exchange the truth of God for a lie, and began to worship the creature(the humanist) instead of the Creator, they are given up as evil. When values are turned upside down and moral anarchy appears, men burn with lust for other man an women burn for women, and they will receive in their own bodies the punishment for their actions (Rom. 1:22-27). From a Biblical standpoint, the rise of homosexuality is a sign that a society is in the last stages of decay.\n Knowing the above, how in the world can a Christian support the homosexual agenda. This is not a lofty attitude as I care about their salvation and want the best spiritually and economically for them. As a fellow human and a Christian I can love them as myself and would be there to help them if I could ,but that doesn't mean that I forsake Godly principles in order to show my compassion and love. I have a few homosexual friends but certainly don't feel I am above them nor do I feel superior. I do feel they are living in sin and I can't support their lifestyle no more than I could support the lifestyle of a polygamist and they respect me for this. So yes, to preserve and protect the sanctity of marriage as declared by God and its traditions ,I would encourage all Christians to support an amendment to the Constitution. It is the homosexuals who instigated all of this trying to change our culture and open the door for others including the youth of our nation into this lifestyle. It is simply a way to protect our values. Do you ever watch their parades and the lasciviousness so displayed? Visit the web site of the gay Olympics. Is this what we want in the forefront of our nation's culture? Is this what you support in the name of Christian moderation? These warm mushy fuzzies and let me love you attitude based on misinformation concerning God's word will destroy our nation and God may well be behind this destruction as he destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah,the Israelites(Isaiah 13) the Babylonians(Isaiah 14:22-23, the Assyrians(Isaiah 14:24-27) the Philistines (Isaiah 14:29-32) the Moabites (Isaiah chapters 15&16) including Jerusalem and the temple Matt. 24th chapter and destroyed in 70 A.D. Look at secular ancient history and how it conforms to the history found in the Bible not always but in many cases. Look at 2 Kings chapters 15 through 17 and how God used the Assyrians to destroy God's people the Israelites because of their disobedience in 722 BC. Look at how He used the Babylonians to destroy again His people in 2Kings the 25th chapter because of their sins of idolatry and disobedience. He totally destroyed Solomon's temple and Jerusalem in 586BC. Do you not think, as it is the same God, that He might not destroy us by our forsaking His Biblical principles? Could He use the terrorist to do this? They certainly want us all dead. Each time He destroyed the Jews a remnant was left to carry on His word in deep repentance. Will He do the same to us if we as a Christian country disobey His will and support the agenda's of evil under the auspices of love and compassion? Why do you think I spend this time in writing to you as I see the danger that lurks as never before and I don't believe the younger generations have been taught Biblical principles. We have never had these problems as we see them today. The sins of the humanist (doing what feels good) and the atheistic secularist dominates our society today. Yet the moderate Christian a term I never heard of applied to Christianity aids and abets their agenda.\n All of these destructions of the above mentioned came about because of the evilness of the nations. I believe God has held us together because of our nations Christian foundations but attitudes like this \"Christian Moderate\" can't help but lead us to destruction if history means anything. One last question on this subject and that is why is it ok for the homosexual to bring his beliefs and politics to the table but the Christian is criticized to the hilt if he or she brings their beliefs and politics to the table. The Christian is suppose to remain silent as they see the Christian principles of this nation torn asunder? I think not. \n Concerning stem cell research. The same thing could be accomplished with umbilical cords. A stem cell requires a fetus while a umbilical cord requires a birth. A fetus in our culture today is usually an abortion. Stem cell research is supported by tax dollars of which many Christians contribute. These tax dollars also encourages abortion through Plan Parenthood. The two go hand in hand and therefore Christians are against it. If the same studies could be accomplished with umbilical cords then why stem cell. I'll tell you why because of the thousands of embryos lying around from abortions. Biblically, abortion is wrong and it is taking of a life. It is murder. The Bible shows that life begins at conception. God fashions us while we are in our mother's womb (Ps.139:13) The prophet Jeremiah and the apostle Paul were called by God before they were born (Jer.1:5;Gal. 1:15). the Baptist leaped in his mother's womb when the voice of Mary, the mother of Jesus, was heard (Luke 1:44).Obviously children in the womb have a spiritual identity.\n From the moment of conception there is a progression of development that continues through adulthood. God condemned the Israelites who were offering their children as sacrifices to the heathen god Molech. Such children were burned up in the fires of sacrifice(Lev.20:2), offered to a god of sensuality and convenience. The same is occurring today, and by acting in this way we are saying that human beings are not worth anything. This is a terrible blot on our society. Do \"Christian Moderates\" call this love?\n The Bible is not more specific on the matter of abortion because such a practice would have been unthinkable to the people of God. For instance, when Israel was in Egypt, a cruel Pharaoh forced the Israelites to kill their newborn babies. In the Bible this was looked upon as the height of cruel oppression (Ex. 1:15-22).The idea of killing their own children would have been anathema to the Hebrews. All through the Old Testament, women yearned to have children. Children were considered as a gift from God. Women prayed not to be barren. How could a righteous women turn against her own children to destroy them? Abortion is not only unthinkable, it is also the height of pagan barbarity. The \"moderate Christian\" politician says ,\"what and lose the women's vote , no way\" . The wind again blows to the left.\n \n In response to Mr. Danforth's comment, \"We think that efforts to haul references of God into the public square, into schools and courthouses, are far more apt to divide Americans than to advance faith\". Please read the email I sent you the other day referring to a email I sent a friend and rebuttal to a editorial for a newspaper whereby I defended the Christian foundations of this country.\n It is not that Christians are trying to put or haul (his Word) references to God into the public square we are trying to keep them in the public square that have existed, some of them since the founding of this country. It is the ACLU, the atheist. the secularist, the humanist that are trying to remove these sacred shrines that are so endearing to the foundations of this country. The Ten Commandments are deeply rooted in America. There are more than fifty depictions of the Ten Commandments in the Supreme Court. We Christians want to keep God within our foundations as He has always been. Apparently the \"moderate Christian\" does not.\n George Washington one of the founders of this country and it's first president said \" Of all the habits that lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain would men claim the tributes of patriotism who would work to destroy(the ACLU) these great pillars of human happiness...It is impossible to govern rightly without God and the Bible.\"\n ******, I urge you to think on these things. Please look up the Scriptures mentioned. If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask.******* sends her love and I do to.\n ***\n (*Change: I removed his bold text to make it gentler on the eyes.)\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n emoticon_idea I know it's VERY lengthy.

Her husband's theological and political ideas are remarkably humorous and disturbing because they are the ideas that he operates with on a daily basis.

Your time and input is greatly appreciated.\n \n Now, enjoy!\n \n --iwakar\n \n P.S. I will include the original article that inspired his \"hemming and hawwing\".\n \n Onward, Moderate Christian Soldiers\n By JOHN C. DANFORTH \n Published: June 17, 2005\n St. Louis\n \n IT would be an oversimplification to say that America's culture wars are now between people of faith and nonbelievers. People of faith are not of one mind, whether on specific issues like stem cell research and government intervention in the case of Terri Schiavo, or the more general issue of how religion relates to politics. In recent years, conservative Christians have presented themselves as representing the one authentic Christian perspective on politics. With due respect for our conservative friends, equally devout Christians come to very different conclusions.\n \n It is important for those of us who are sometimes called moderates to make the case that we, too, have strongly held Christian convictions, that we speak from the depths of our beliefs, and that our approach to politics is at least as faithful as that of those who are more conservative. Our difference concerns the extent to which government should, or even can, translate religious beliefs into the laws of the state.\n \n People of faith have the right, and perhaps the obligation, to bring their values to bear in politics. Many conservative Christians approach politics with a certainty that they know God's truth, and that they can advance the kingdom of God through governmental action. So they have developed a political agenda that they believe advances God's kingdom, one that includes efforts to \"put God back\" into the public square and to pass a constitutional amendment intended to protect marriage from the perceived threat of homosexuality. \n \n Moderate Christians are less certain about when and how our beliefs can be translated into statutory form, not because of a lack of faith in God but because of a healthy acknowledgement of the limitations of human beings. Like conservative Christians, we attend church, read the Bible and say our prayers. \n \n But for us, the only absolute standard of behavior is the commandment to love our neighbors as ourselves. Repeatedly in the Gospels, we find that the Love Commandment takes precedence when it conflicts with laws. We struggle to follow that commandment as we face the realities of everyday living, and we do not agree that our responsibility to live as Christians can be codified by legislators.\n \n When, on television, we see a person in a persistent vegetative state, one who will never recover, we believe that allowing the natural and merciful end to her ordeal is more loving than imposing government power to keep her hooked up to a feeding tube.\n \n When we see an opportunity to save our neighbors' lives through stem cell research, we believe that it is our duty to pursue that research, and to oppose legislation that would impede us from doing so.\n \n We think that efforts to haul references of God into the public square, into schools and courthouses, are far more apt to divide Americans than to advance faith.\n \n Following a Lord who reached out in compassion to all human beings, we oppose amending the Constitution in a way that would humiliate homosexuals.\n \n For us, living the Love Commandment may be at odds with efforts to encapsulate Christianity in a political agenda. We strongly support the separation of church and state, both because that principle is essential to holding together a diverse country, and because the policies of the state always fall short of the demands of faith. Aware that even our most passionate ventures into politics are efforts to carry the treasure of religion in the earthen vessel of government, we proceed in a spirit of humility lacking in our conservative colleagues.\n \n In the decade since I left the Senate, American politics has been characterized by two phenomena: the increased activism of the Christian right, especially in the Republican Party, and the collapse of bipartisan collegiality. I do not think it is a stretch to suggest a relationship between the two. To assert that I am on God's side and you are not, that I know God's will and you do not, and that I will use the power of government to advance my understanding of God's kingdom is certain to produce hostility.\n \n By contrast, moderate Christians see ourselves, literally, as moderators. Far from claiming to possess God's truth, we claim only to be imperfect seekers of the truth. We reject the notion that religion should present a series of wedge issues useful at election time for energizing a political base. We believe it is God's work to practice humility, to wear tolerance on our sleeves, to reach out to those with whom we disagree, and to overcome the meanness we see in today's politics.\n \n For us, religion should be inclusive, and it should seek to bridge the differences that separate people. We do not exclude from worship those whose opinions differ from ours. Following a Lord who sat at the table with tax collectors and sinners, we welcome to the Lord's table all who would come. Following a Lord who cited love of God and love of neighbor as encompassing all the commandments, we reject a political agenda that displaces that love. Christians who hold these convictions ought to add their clear voice of moderation to the debate on religion in politics. \n \n John C. Danforth is an Episcopal minister and former Republican senator from Missouri.\n \n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n (His reply to the article in the form of an e-mail to me.)\n \n Hi ******,\n This is the first time I have ever heard of a Moderate Christian. We are all one in Christ(Gal.3:28) therefore I have never thought of a Christian in terms of moderation. I am familiar with the word but decided to look it up anyway to see how it might fit into Christianity. So here goes, moderate-not extreme or excessive; temperate in opinions, views, or behavior;inclined toward the average in size, extent, or quality; mediocre. Based on this Webster definition my first thoughts went to Revelation 3:14-16 concerning the lukewarm church.\"And to the angel of the church of the Lacodiceans write, These things say the Amen, the faithful and the True Witness, the Beginning of the creation of God. I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were cold or hot. So then because you are lukewarm and neither cold nor hot. I will vomit you out of my mouth.\" I have always understood that the moderate is one who sits on the fence and is led by which ever way the wind blows. If it is expedient to think according to the thought of the day, then so be it and if it is not then so be it. In other words a moderate then as a Christian may stand for what God word says one day if it is expedient(expediency for politicians is votes) and may not the next day if it doesn't suit his or her agenda. If it is a liberal agenda then that agenda will always come first over God's Word. (Surely it is not offensive to call one a liberal and to make statements I believe are true if in the article you sent compares so much the righteousness of the moderate Christian to the faults of the conservative Christian, RE \"we (the moderate Christian) proceed in a spirit of humility lacking in our conservative colleagues.\" \n Consider the homosexual issue. God said that a man should leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh, Gen. 2:24. The Apostle Paul said in 1Cor.6:9,10 \"Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators , nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites, nor thieves. nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God.\" So my question to you is how does a \"moderate Christian\" justify his or her stand on homosexual marriage? If this is so important then so is polygamy important. If one is ok then why not the other. Or why can't an adult marry a child or a father his daughter better than that a father marries his son. Better yet let's encourage marriage between a person and his or her dog. Throw it out to everybody. Don't make it so exclusive says the moderate. God is meaningless in our society today. It is not what God wants but what man wants.\n I noticed with interest how your article speaks of the \"moderate Christian\" who tries to obey Christ as Christ quotes Leviticus 19:18 found in Matt. 5:43 \"that you should love your neighbor as yourself \" but fails to notice in the context of Leviticus, Leviticus 20:13 just a few verses over, \"If a man lies with a male as he lies with a women, both of them have committed an abomination. They shall surely be put to death. Their blood shall be upon them. \" You see he ignores it because it doesn't fit his agenda and would lose for him the homosexual vote but pays attention to Matt 5:43 because it gives him a feeling of loftiness and conscience healing and he can throw all of his Biblical failures into this one arena of \"love\" and thus soothe his conscience for his political achievements as he bathes in and adores his piety of the moderate behavior patterns. (See the last sentence of your article of the 10th paragraph.) See how he sits on the fence and waits for the wind to blow and the winds blows him to the left due to the expediency of maintaining the homosexual vote and others who support their agenda. As a Christian he has the opportunity to stand with God on these principles but refuses and so adopts the characteristics of the lukewarm moderate church of the Lacodiceans of which God says because of their lukewarmness neither hot or cold God will spew them out of His mouth Rev.3:14-16.\n Summarizing, the Bible says homosexuality is an abomination for a man to lie with a man as with a woman, or a woman to lie with a woman as with a man (Lev. 18:22;20:13). The Bible says that because of certain abominations such as homosexuality. a land will vomit out its inhabitants(Lev.18:25). The apostle Paul called it \"shameful\", the results of being given up by God to \"vile passions\" Rom. 1:24-27.\n In the Old Testament, those who practiced these things were removed from the congregation of Israel by execution.. We are told in the New Testament that those who practice homosexuality will not enter into the kingdom of God (1Cor. 6:9,10). The apostle Paul shows homosexuality as a final order of rebellion against God. When people exchange the truth of God for a lie, and began to worship the creature(the humanist) instead of the Creator, they are given up as evil. When values are turned upside down and moral anarchy appears, men burn with lust for other man an women burn for women, and they will receive in their own bodies the punishment for their actions (Rom. 1:22-27). From a Biblical standpoint, the rise of homosexuality is a sign that a society is in the last stages of decay.\n Knowing the above, how in the world can a Christian support the homosexual agenda. This is not a lofty attitude as I care about their salvation and want the best spiritually and economically for them. As a fellow human and a Christian I can love them as myself and would be there to help them if I could ,but that doesn't mean that I forsake Godly principles in order to show my compassion and love. I have a few homosexual friends but certainly don't feel I am above them nor do I feel superior. I do feel they are living in sin and I can't support their lifestyle no more than I could support the lifestyle of a polygamist and they respect me for this. So yes, to preserve and protect the sanctity of marriage as declared by God and its traditions ,I would encourage all Christians to support an amendment to the Constitution. It is the homosexuals who instigated all of this trying to change our culture and open the door for others including the youth of our nation into this lifestyle. It is simply a way to protect our values. Do you ever watch their parades and the lasciviousness so displayed? Visit the web site of the gay Olympics. Is this what we want in the forefront of our nation's culture? Is this what you support in the name of Christian moderation? These warm mushy fuzzies and let me love you attitude based on misinformation concerning God's word will destroy our nation and God may well be behind this destruction as he destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah,the Israelites(Isaiah 13) the Babylonians(Isaiah 14:22-23, the Assyrians(Isaiah 14:24-27) the Philistines (Isaiah 14:29-32) the Moabites (Isaiah chapters 15&16) including Jerusalem and the temple Matt. 24th chapter and destroyed in 70 A.D. Look at secular ancient history and how it conforms to the history found in the Bible not always but in many cases. Look at 2 Kings chapters 15 through 17 and how God used the Assyrians to destroy God's people the Israelites because of their disobedience in 722 BC. Look at how He used the Babylonians to destroy again His people in 2Kings the 25th chapter because of their sins of idolatry and disobedience. He totally destroyed Solomon's temple and Jerusalem in 586BC. Do you not think, as it is the same God, that He might not destroy us by our forsaking His Biblical principles? Could He use the terrorist to do this? They certainly want us all dead. Each time He destroyed the Jews a remnant was left to carry on His word in deep repentance. Will He do the same to us if we as a Christian country disobey His will and support the agenda's of evil under the auspices of love and compassion? Why do you think I spend this time in writing to you as I see the danger that lurks as never before and I don't believe the younger generations have been taught Biblical principles. We have never had these problems as we see them today. The sins of the humanist (doing what feels good) and the atheistic secularist dominates our society today. Yet the moderate Christian a term I never heard of applied to Christianity aids and abets their agenda.\n All of these destructions of the above mentioned came about because of the evilness of the nations. I believe God has held us together because of our nations Christian foundations but attitudes like this \"Christian Moderate\" can't help but lead us to destruction if history means anything. One last question on this subject and that is why is it ok for the homosexual to bring his beliefs and politics to the table but the Christian is criticized to the hilt if he or she brings their beliefs and politics to the table. The Christian is suppose to remain silent as they see the Christian principles of this nation torn asunder? I think not. \n Concerning stem cell research. The same thing could be accomplished with umbilical cords. A stem cell requires a fetus while a umbilical cord requires a birth. A fetus in our culture today is usually an abortion. Stem cell research is supported by tax dollars of which many Christians contribute. These tax dollars also encourages abortion through Plan Parenthood. The two go hand in hand and therefore Christians are against it. If the same studies could be accomplished with umbilical cords then why stem cell. I'll tell you why because of the thousands of embryos lying around from abortions. Biblically, abortion is wrong and it is taking of a life. It is murder. The Bible shows that life begins at conception. God fashions us while we are in our mother's womb (Ps.139:13) The prophet Jeremiah and the apostle Paul were called by God before they were born (Jer.1:5;Gal. 1:15). the Baptist leaped in his mother's womb when the voice of Mary, the mother of Jesus, was heard (Luke 1:44).Obviously children in the womb have a spiritual identity.\n From the moment of conception there is a progression of development that continues through adulthood. God condemned the Israelites who were offering their children as sacrifices to the heathen god Molech. Such children were burned up in the fires of sacrifice(Lev.20:2), offered to a god of sensuality and convenience. The same is occurring today, and by acting in this way we are saying that human beings are not worth anything. This is a terrible blot on our society. Do \"Christian Moderates\" call this love?\n The Bible is not more specific on the matter of abortion because such a practice would have been unthinkable to the people of God. For instance, when Israel was in Egypt, a cruel Pharaoh forced the Israelites to kill their newborn babies. In the Bible this was looked upon as the height of cruel oppression (Ex. 1:15-22).The idea of killing their own children would have been anathema to the Hebrews. All through the Old Testament, women yearned to have children. Children were considered as a gift from God. Women prayed not to be barren. How could a righteous women turn against her own children to destroy them? Abortion is not only unthinkable, it is also the height of pagan barbarity. The \"moderate Christian\" politician says ,\"what and lose the women's vote , no way\" . The wind again blows to the left.\n \n In response to Mr. Danforth's comment, \"We think that efforts to haul references of God into the public square, into schools and courthouses, are far more apt to divide Americans than to advance faith\". Please read the email I sent you the other day referring to a email I sent a friend and rebuttal to a editorial for a newspaper whereby I defended the Christian foundations of this country.\n It is not that Christians are trying to put or haul (his Word) references to God into the public square we are trying to keep them in the public square that have existed, some of them since the founding of this country. It is the ACLU, the atheist. the secularist, the humanist that are trying to remove these sacred shrines that are so endearing to the foundations of this country. The Ten Commandments are deeply rooted in America. There are more than fifty depictions of the Ten Commandments in the Supreme Court. We Christians want to keep God within our foundations as He has always been. Apparently the \"moderate Christian\" does not.\n George Washington one of the founders of this country and it's first president said \" Of all the habits that lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain would men claim the tributes of patriotism who would work to destroy(the ACLU) these great pillars of human happiness...It is impossible to govern rightly without God and the Bible.\"\n ******, I urge you to think on these things. Please look up the Scriptures mentioned. If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask.******* sends her love and I do to.\n ***\n (*Change: I removed his bold text to make it gentler on the eyes.)\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n emoticon_idea I know it's VERY lengthy.

   "I'm not overly religious, but I believe in Christian beliefs and a higher power. I also believe that the Bible is more of a handbook than a set of rules. His rules were put on stone tablets, and that makes them stiff. A bible is malleable depending on a person's individual belief. I don't mean that one may take advantage of His words, merely that a person can take whatever interpretation they truly feel.
