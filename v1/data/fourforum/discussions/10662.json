   "I repeat. Fulfilled Prophecies are PROOF and solid EVIDENCE regarding the truth of God and His Holy Word. But notice how it is ignored by those demanding proof that it is reliable, observable, testable evidence that regular human beings had foreknowledge of events yet to happen.\n \n In order for scriptural evidence of Gods reality to be proven, the evidence must first be OBJECTIVELY SCRUTINIZED WITH AN OPEN MIND IN A SEARCH FOR THE TRUTH. Bible students seek the truth without pre-determining the outcome. According to Jewish Law, if even one prophecy a prophet makes doesn't come true then he is a false prophet and nothing he said should be believed. Here are some prophecies that prove the bibles ability to foresee the future events and is strong evidence that God is real as no prophet claims to know those things apart from God.\n \n http://www.reasons.org/resources/apologetics/prophecy.shtml\n (1) Some time before 500 B.C. the prophet Daniel proclaimed that Israel's long-awaited Messiah would begin his public ministry 483 years after the issuing of a decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem (Daniel 9:25-26). He further predicted that the Messiah would be \"cut off,\" killed, and that this event would take place prior to a second destruction of Jerusalem. Abundant documentation shows that these prophecies were perfectly fulfilled in the life (and crucifixion) of Jesus Christ. The decree regarding the restoration of Jerusalem was issued by Persia's King Artaxerxes to the Hebrew priest Ezra in 458 B.C., 483 years later the ministry of Jesus Christ began in Galilee. (Remember that due to calendar changes, the date for the start of Christ's ministry is set by most historians at about 26 A.D. Also note that from 1 B.C. to 1 A.D. is just one year.) Jesus' crucifixion occurred only a few years later, and about four decades later, in 70 A.D. came the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus.\n \n (Probability of chance fulfillment = 1 in 105.)*\n \n (2) In approximately 700 B.C. the prophet Micah named the tiny village of Bethlehem as the birthplace of Israel's Messiah (Micah 5:2). The fulfillment of this prophecy in the birth of Christ is one of the most widely known and widely celebrated facts in history.\n \n (Probability of chance fulfillment = 1 in 105.)\n \n (3) In the fifth century B.C. a prophet named Zechariah declared that the Messiah would be betrayed for the price of a slave-thirty pieces of silver, according to Jewish law-and also that this money would be used to buy a burial ground for Jerusalem's poor foreigners (Zechariah 11:12-13). Bible writers and secular historians both record thirty pieces of silver as the sum paid to Judas Iscariot for betraying Jesus, and they indicate that the money went to purchase a \"potter's field,\" used-just as predicted-for the burial of poor aliens (Matthew 27:3-10).\n \n (Probability of chance fulfillment = 1 in 1011.)\n \n (4) Some 400 years before crucifixion was invented, both Israel's King David and the prophet Zechariah described the Messiah's death in words that perfectly depict that mode of execution. Further, they said that the body would be pierced and that none of the bones would be broken, contrary to customary procedure in cases of crucifixion (Psalm 22 and 34:20; Zechariah 12:10). Again, historians and New Testament writers confirm the fulfillment: Jesus of Nazareth died on a Roman cross, and his extraordinarily quick death eliminated the need for the usual breaking of bones. A spear was thrust into his side to verify that he was, indeed, dead.\n \n (Probability of chance fulfillment = 1 in 1013.)",

(Remember that due to calendar changes, the date for the start of Christ's ministry is set by most historians at about 26 A.D. Also note that from 1 B.C. to 1 A.D. is just one year.)

Bible writers and secular historians both record thirty pieces of silver as the sum paid to Judas Iscariot for betraying Jesus, and they indicate that the money went to purchase a \"potter's field,\" used-just as predicted-for the burial of poor aliens (Matthew 27:3-10).\n \n (Probability of chance fulfillment = 1 in 1011.)\n \n (4) Some 400 years before crucifixion was invented, both Israel's King David and the prophet Zechariah described the Messiah's death in words that perfectly depict that mode of execution.

Again, historians and New Testament writers confirm the fulfillment: Jesus of Nazareth died on a Roman cross, and his extraordinarily quick death eliminated the need for the usual breaking of bones.

Thereafter, millions of people were born and died during the following 750 years between the date of prophecy and its fulfilment. Yet what they wrote was fulfilled to the very word hundreds of years later.\n \n As dead people cannot keep their promises, we can conclude that these words were not of the prophets' themselves, but of God who inspired them to write. We can see the INVISIBLE HAND of GOD working to fulfil these prophecies hundreds of years later. Space will not permit me to list all the various prophecies and their fulfilment here. Thus it proves that the Bible is God's inspired word.\n \n IT ALSO PROVES THAT GOD EXISTS\n and He is Almighty, Omnipresent, Omniscient, Faithful and Trustworthy.\n ALMIGHTY or All Powerful: There is nothing impossible with God. The virgin birth is humanly impossible, but for God nothing is impossible.\n EVERYWHERE PRESENT or Omnipresent: He was present when He inspired his prophets to write, He was present at the time when it was fulfilled and He is alive even today to fulfil some more prophecies that need to be fulfilled in the future. He is the eternal God.\n ALL KNOWING or Omniscient: He knows everything about the past, present and the future. That is why He could prophesy through the prophets what happened and also what is going to happen in the future. That is why He could inspire Moses to write down how He created the world (the book of Genesis) even though Moses was not present at the time. For the same reason, He inspired John to write what is going to happen far into the future (the Book of Revelation), and all other books of the Bible through the rest of the writers.\n FAITHFUL or Promise Keeping: for He has kept all His promises and predictions of the future no matter how many there are.\n TRUSTWORTHY: As He has proved faithful in the past, we can TRUST Him to fulfil all the future promises too.\n In summary we KNOW that: GOD EXISTS, He is ALIVE and He is ACTIVE. The Holy Bible is God's inspired Word with special messages to meet man's present and future needs. JESUS is the promised MESSIAH, the Son of God and the Saviour of the world.",

Nostrodamus did as well in his predictions.\n \n \nIsaiah 49:6\n God's salvation would reach the ends of the earth \n\n Many dieties power would reach all nations. It's a common boast.\n Tremble before the might of Baal!\n The harsh light of Nergal shines upon all.\n \n \n \nIsaiah 53:3\n The Messiah would suffer and be rejected \n\n Which messiah didn't?\n Furthermore, this is simply a back-handed disclaimer that if anyone with discernment sees a con man for who he is and cries warnings, well, that just proves that the con man is the real deal.\n It's remarkable how many bobble headed followers of televangelists cry out 'touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm' when their favorite pimp is being outted as a charlatain. Witness the recent senate inquiry into the tax status of top tele-pimps like Binny Hinn...a \"tru mand o' gawd.\"\n \n \nIsaiah 53:5\n God's servant would be wounded and whipped \n\n Well, what do you expect when you're a heretic and transgressing Gods laws?\n I wonder how many of of 'Gods' radical emmesaries you'd see whipped and wounded for their false beliefs. To date, you've stated several of your fellow self-proclaimed 'Christians' here are doomed.\n \n \nIsaiah 53:7\n God's servant would be silent before His accusers \n\n And if your read your bible...Jesus wasn't (always) silent befor his accusers. Looks like he failed this test...must mean he wasn't the real deal after all.\n \n \nIsaiah 53:9\n God's servant would be buried in a rich man's tomb \n\n Did it say 'borrowed' rich mans tomb? Cause He allegedly didn't stay there long.\n \n \nIsaiah 53:12\n God's servant would be crucified with criminals \n\n Well, He was a criminal...DUH!\n All you need do to have this fulfilled is be a criminal.\n \n \nIsaiah 61:1-2\n Isaiah foreshadows the ministry of Jesus \n\n In conclusion. when 'prophacies' are lain out, all you need to do is mimick them and have followers exclaim that you've fulfilled them. \n If the next messiah were to have been predicted to have walked a mile on his hands, how many people do you think would have tried until a few dozen got it right?\n \n \nJeremiah 23:3-6\n The Messiah will appear after the Jews return to Israel \n\n Is this a prophacy to come??? The Jews were enslaved and freed a number of times before this 'event' came to pass in the past.\n He has yet to return in these times.\n \n \nDaniel 9:24-26\n Daniel predicted when an anointed one would be rejected \n \n Micah 5:2\n The Messiah would be born in Bethlehem\n\n Not too hard to jiggle these about.\n I'm sure other failed prophacies predicted elsewhere for other messiahs...they just didn't make the cut for the bible. \n \n \nZechariah 9:9\n The Messiah would enter Jerusalem while riding on a donkey \n\n And to fulfill this, all you need to do is steal a donkey.\n I rode into Jerusalem on a donkey...does that make me the messiah.\n \n \nZechariah 11:12-13\n Zechariah foreshadowed the betrayal of Jesus for 30 pieces of silver \n\n And, how do we exactly know how much Judas was paid. Did Judas brag about his payment to many before hanging himself? Did the temple priests in on the deal do so?\n Seems like a made up detail added later to 'support the notion that Jesus was the messiah'.\n \n \n \n Hard study of the prophasies and the real life of this Jesus fella would go to show that he really wasn't the guy predicted to come.\n His character was shoe-horned into the position long after his death...when the Gosples were written. Historic revisions.\n \n My wife was like you Arch.\n Until forced to face the truth for a time.\n \n Want to know her revelation and answer?\n \n Like in the movie the Last Temptation of God, she acknowledged that her God was the God of Paul in the Movie. A manufactured entity better than reality simply because she, like many others, can't deal with reality without a crutch and a scapegoat. \n We see that numerous times when discussing morality. Many who co-opt a moral system from a commonly accepted source simply couldn't come up with something 'nice' and acceptable on their own. Without an external force of some form that is 'answerable to no-one' they are asocial and immoral creatures.\n My wife, like about 90%+ of the self professed Christians I've met are, at heart, morally bankrupt and craven creatures. Prideful in their ignorance and percieved rightness. Wrathful and gleeful at the misfortune of others and ever egar to have a hand in it. Self-rightious and embracing the so-called 7 deadly sins. How many Christians do you know who are gluttonous and lustful? Exploitive and engage in usury? Seek to advance their own agendas and kin at the cost of others. How many are slothful and would rather toss a buck in the coffers and have someone else take care of the poor and broken rather than honestly follow their messiah's dictates and DO IT THEMSELVES.\n \n If you need the blinders of a made up mythological system to make you a decent person, then stay Christian.\n I'd rather deal with honest corruption than the hypocracy of religion.\n In my personal life, I've found less of either in atheists than I have in blievers. \n Of course, your mileage may vary.\n \n \n But, know this, I have a new improved messiah for your to follow...ah darn, the pimps already beat me to it...\n It's the one you follow. \n Now, toddle off and babble to Your own, personal, Jesus.

   "I guess my parenting style will differ greatly from yours.\n \n If a child asks for a symbol or sign that you love him/her, that you're there for them, you understand, etc..., or is testing the boundaries of the relationship, as all children do, would your response be to do nothing, because \"that's your perogative and you don't have to prove anything to anyone, you're the parent\". If so, I feel sorry for you and your children.\n \n If I can't justify the action and somehow make a child understand, I think that's pretty good reason to question the action. Furthermore, it's in no way a matter of obligation, it's a matter of common sense, respect, and love.\n\n \n Well, as a parent I can tell you there are MANY situations that can come up involving not wanting to give your child an explanation, for their own good. You assume, automatically, that I'm talking about cases that would involve selfish reasons apparently, but that's not what I'm addressing. This is just one of many possible examples, but if you tell your child \"don't play in Mr. So-and-so's yard\", and the reason is that you know he has a history of trying to molest children, are you going to explain what sexual molestation means, rape, and a host of other awful violent actions when your child is very young to process all that? Maybe you would give all the sordid details, but I wouldn't, not until he was a bit older, and until then, \"because I said so\" would have to suffice. FWIW, I can say from experience that if you were to say that you think you'll never once limit an explanation to your child to \"because I said so\", or at least not give them anything close to the whole story in terms of explanation, you'll probably eat those words some day.\n \n \nYour position, and I paraphrase, is that \"God is God, and he can do as he likes, if he doesn't want to respond, he doesn't have to, he's not obligated to prove himself to you or anyone.\" That's a very arrogant statement that you've made on God's behalf, and portrays him as being annoyed that his creations would be so insulting as to ask him to prove he exists.\n\n \n Arrogance and reality-based-on-the-situation are two different things. Arrogance is an emotional thing; I'm not talking about that. Is is \"arrogant\" that a cop can slap the cuffs on you if you talk badly enough to him? He can. That's not emotion, it's reality. You may FEEL it's arrogant that he can do that, but that's the reality of the situation. It is arrogant that a judge can hold you in contempt of court if you don't shut the hell up when he tells you to in his court room? Or that he doesn't have to tell you at what point he'd do so? Arrogance is hugely dependent on your own perceptions, and you've made it clear that you view authority that doesn't owe an explanation as arrogant. I don't see that it has be perceived that way at all.\n \n \nExactly, and he chooses to provide no proof, so I choose not to believe.\n \n His loss. :p\n\n \n Alrighty, if you say so! [shrug] :) \n \n (And again, the way I see it, he HAS given you proof, you just won't view the proof he's given you as such.)\n \n \nReally, I was under the impressiong that there was give and take, that the relationship between God and believer was a two way relationship of love and trust. That in return for faith, the believer would be given forgiveness for their sins, an afterlife, and God's eternal love. Am I mistaken on that?\n \n I have a different view of it than that. Eternal life and the life of a relationship with God is a gift, period. There's nothing I could ever do to reciprocate something like that.",

But for all of them to have been fulfilled by just ONE MAN, Jesus, is mathematically impossible unless He is in fact the promised one and the prophecies were from God as inspired promises. This is also solid evidence that the bible is Gods inspired word and not the stories and myths of a bunch of bronze age sheep herders as is so often opined by your side of the debate.\n \n But I don't expect an atheist to just accept that hands down so let's get specific shall we? Explain this very precise prophecy regarding the coming of Messiah by Daniel the Prophet that states His ministry would start 483 years after Jerusalem is ordered rebuilt? Can you explain who this applies to OTHER THAN JESUS the CHRIST? \n \n I wish you would actually research the historical facts regarding the timing of this prophecy and see how incredibly impossible it would be for it to be either thought up and recorded, or fulfilled by some fluke of history. This is why believers like me insist and know that the bible is Gods inspired Word and is reliable and trustworthy. \n (1) Some time before 500 B.C. the prophet Daniel proclaimed that Israel's long-awaited Messiah would begin his public ministry 483 years after the issuing of a decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem (Daniel 9:25-26). He further predicted that the Messiah would be \"cut off,\" killed, and that this event would take place prior to a second destruction of Jerusalem. Abundant documentation shows that these prophecies were perfectly fulfilled in the life (and crucifixion) of Jesus Christ. The decree regarding the restoration of Jerusalem was issued by Persia's King Artaxerxes to the Hebrew priest Ezra in 458 B.C., 483 years later the ministry of Jesus Christ began in Galilee. (Remember that due to calendar changes, the date for the start of Christ's ministry is set by most historians at about 26 A.D. Also note that from 1 B.C. to 1 A.D. is just one year.) Jesus' crucifixion occurred only a few years later, and about four decades later, in 70 A.D. came the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus.\n ",

   "Yes, Archie, we know that creationists didn't come up with the big bang theory. However, the possibility that the universe has always existed, does not make any claims about the state of the universe at any given time. If the big bang theory is true then the universe was once compacted into a very small volume (it was still the universe, in that it contained all the required matter, mass etc).\n \n And I have not seen this accusation that creationists are all over the place. The usual argument is that creationists stick to the same fictional rubbish despite all the evidence that points to some other reality.\n \n And 'humanists' do not claim to be consistant, they claim to be constantly in search of the truth, and changing their views when stronger evidence is produced (strong evidence being something you are unfamiliar with).\n \n Smiley\n\n \n So now your saying that even though the mass of the universe was compressed to the size of a ball bearing at one time, it was still the universe? Then by that thinking a fertilized egg in the womb of a woman is still a person, RIGHT??? If your World View is consistent then you must agree with that conclusion.

   "oc, I will agree with you that any one of the biblical prophecies could be fulfilled by large amounts of men given enough time.

Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy.

I notice you didn't hijack this post and even attempt an answer to this prophecy. \n Explain this very precise prophecy regarding the coming of Messiah by Daniel the Prophet that states His ministry would start 483 years after Jerusalem is ordered rebuilt? Can you explain who this applies to OTHER THAN JESUS the CHRIST? \n \n I wish you would actually research the historical facts regarding the timing of this prophecy and see how incredibly impossible it would be for it to be either thought up and recorded, or fulfilled by some fluke of history. This is why believers like me insist and know that the bible is Gods inspired Word and is reliable and trustworthy. \n \n (1) Some time before 500 B.C. the prophet Daniel proclaimed that Israel's long-awaited Messiah would begin his public ministry 483 years after the issuing of a decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem (Daniel 9:25-26). He further predicted that the Messiah would be \"cut off,\" killed, and that this event would take place prior to a second destruction of Jerusalem. Abundant documentation shows that these prophecies were perfectly fulfilled in the life (and crucifixion) of Jesus Christ. The decree regarding the restoration of Jerusalem was issued by Persia's King Artaxerxes to the Hebrew priest Ezra in 458 B.C., 483 years later the ministry of Jesus Christ began in Galilee. (Remember that due to calendar changes, the date for the start of Christ's ministry is set by most historians at about 26 A.D. Also note that from 1 B.C. to 1 A.D. is just one year.) Jesus' crucifixion occurred only a few years later, and about four decades later, in 70 A.D. came the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus.\n I dare your side to seriously research this historically documentable prophecy and then explain how it was counterfeited by Jesus whom your side either claims didn't exist or was just an illiterate carpenters son? \n The Greatest Time Prophecy in the Bible\n \n If you have an interest in the Bible, be sure to take a look at the prophecy included here. It has been called the \"greatest time prophecy in the Bible.\"\n \n What did Daniel predict in the Bible about the coming of the Messiah?\n \n In 538 B.C. Daniel wrote, \"So you are to know and discern that from the issuing of a decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until Messiah the Prince there will be seven weeks of years and sixty-two weeks of years\" (Daniel 9:25).\n \n The time period between these two events would be 69 weeks of years. This was predicted 538 years before Christ.\n \n When was the \"decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem\" issued?\n \n Artaxerxes, a Persian king, ascended to the throne in 464 B.C. Therefore, his twentieth year would be 444 B.C.\n \n Nehemiah, the Jewish cupbearer to King Artaxerxes, was deeply concerned with the reports about the ruined condition of Jerusalem (Nehemiah 1:1-4) and thus petitioned the king: \"Send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers' tombs, that I may rebuild it. So it pleased the king to send me\" (Nehemiah 2:5,6). The exact date of this decree to restore and to rebuild Jerusalem is given: \"in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king\" (Nehemiah 2:1).\n \n The Jewish calendar month was Nisan, and since no day is given, it is reasonable to assume that the date would be understood as the first, the Jewish New Year's Day. Hence, in the Julian calendar, the corresponding date would be March 5, 444 B.C.\n \n This was the day on which the decree was issued to restore and rebuild Jerusalem.\n \n When did the \"Messiah the Prince\" appear?\n \n Jesus had previously, on numerous occasions, forbidden his followers to make him known as \"the Messiah\". He would frequently do miracles and tell the disciples not to tell anyone who had done the miracles because his \"hour has not yet come\" (John 2:4, 7:6).\n \n However, on March 30, 33 A.D., when he entered Jerusalem on a donkey, he rebuked the Pharisees' protest and encouraged the whole multitude of his disciples as they shouted, \"Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord\". And Jesus said, \"If these become silent, the stones will cry out\" (Luke 19:38-40). \n \n This was the day on which Jesus was publicly declared the Messiah.\n \n How are the dates calculated in Daniel?\n \n Since Daniel states 69 weeks of seven years each, and each year has 360 days, the equation is as follows: 69 x 7 x 360 = 173,880 days.\n \n In nothing more than a simple mathematical demonstration, the number of days in the period from March 5, 444 B.C. (the twentieth year of Artaxerxes) to March 30, 33 A.D. (the day Jesus entered Jerusalem on the donkey) will be determined at this point. 444 B.C. to 33 A.D. is 476 years (1 B.C. to 1 A.D. is only one year). 476 x 365.2421879 (corrected for leap years) = 173,855 days. March 5 to March 30 = 25 days. Total = 173,880 days.\n \n Why does Daniel use \"years\" of 360 days each?\n \n There is conclusive evidence to show that the prophetic year of the Bible is composed of 360 days, or twelve months of 30 days.\n \n Daniel 9:27 mentions a period of Jewish persecution at the hands of the coming prince who will make a covenant with that people. Since this persecution begins in the \"midst\" of the seventieth week of years and continues to the \"end\" of the week of years, the period is obviously three and one-half years. \n \n Revelation 13:4-7 speaks of the same great political ruler and his persecution of the Jewish \"saints\" lasting \"forty two months\". And this period is further defined in Revelation 12:6 as \"a thousand two hundred and three score days\", or 1,260 days. If 1,260 days is divided by 42 months or 3-1/2 years, the result is a 30-day month and a 360-day year.\n \n Therefore, it is clear that the length of the year in prophecy is fixed by the Bible itself as exactly 360 days.\n \n Why does Daniel use the phrase \"weeks of years\"?\n \n In Daniel's writings in Chapter 9 he used the Hebrew word shabua, which means literally a \"seven\", but is usually translated into English as \"week of years\". To the English ear a week always means a seven of days, but to the Jews shabua alone always meant a seven of years. Thus Daniel was literally referring to weeks of years here.\n \n Daniel used the Hebrew word shabua alone when referring to the well-known \"week\" of years, a customary usage which every Jew would understand; but in Chapter 10, when he speaks of the \"three weeks\" of fasting, he specifies them as \"weeks of days\" in order to distinguish them from the \"weeks\" of years in Chapter 9.\n \n What is the significance of this prophecy?\n \n The exact fulfillment of this prophecy is sufficient to demonstrate the accuracy of Daniel and also by implication the inspiration of the Bible and the truth of Christianity, because only God can \"declare the end from the beginning\" and forecast to the very day \"things that are not yet done\" (Isaiah 46:10).\n \n Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said: \"Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? Who determined its measurements? Who stretched the line upon it? To what were its foundations fastened? Who laid its cornerstone?\" (Job 38:1-6)\n \n And suddenly a great storm arose on the sea, so that the boat was covered with the waves. But He was asleep. Then His disciples came to Him and awoke Him, saying, \"Lord, save us! We are perishing!\" But He said to them, \"Why are you fearful, O you of little faith?\" Then He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm. So the men marveled, saying, \"Who can this be, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?\" (Matthew 9:24-27)",

God did form all of time and space when He formed and created the World for humanity. But in your limited understanding that implies God had no place to dwell before creating us, right? What about the place we call Heaven? Surely God had a dwelling place for Himself and the Angelic Hosts who made up the Creation that existed prior to humanity.\n Gen 1:14 \n Then God said, \"Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs and seasons, and for days and years;\n Gen 1:15 \n \"and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heavens to give light on the earth\"; and it was so.\n Gen 1:16 \n Then God made two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. He made the stars also.\n Gen 1:17 \n God set them in the firmament of the heavens to give light on the earth,\n Gen 1:18 \n and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.\n Gen 1:19 \n So the evening and the morning were the fourth day.\n We understand that there is much we don't know of when God formed the vastness of time and space but that doesn't stop you all from assuming what we believe or what God intends for us to know at this time..\n \n \nWhy you've labelled us all as Humanists, I've no idea. Why do you think that? And as for your allegation of selective reasoning on our part, it seems to me the problem is with the creationists' selective unreasoning. The only answer ever warranted is the untestable Goddidit.\n\n \n Because if one rejects Gods truth for mans, that is the humanist perspective. God say's in Mat 6:24 \"No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.\n \n And you always say \"the untestable God did it.\" Yet I have posted fulfilled prophecies that prove the ability for future events to be known before they happened and your side just scoffs, mocks or ignores them. So you don't even dare to really test God as any evidence of the supernatural that is presented is totally brushed aside by the philosophical cowards that make up your side of this debate.",

If it's OK for a so-called Christian to use that terminology, then all I can say is that the biggest coward is the bile-spouting creationist who hides behind his god.\n\n \n Again you misrepresent what is true charlie. You think it's cowardly to willingly give up my free will in life and dedicate myself to trusting all that I am in this World to my God, whom I needed to first submit to before receiving His Holy Spirit? On the contrary my friend, Believers who submit to the living God will be shown to be the most courageous of all of Gods children. \n \n And those who wasted their lives living for themselves in denial of the truth were in fact too afraid to give up their free will in favor of striving for the perfection that only comes from trusting a perfect and holy personal God of love. \n \n I realize this way of thinking is diametrically opposed to the way the World reasons. That is why we are from different Worlds and can't relate in so many areas of life. The Natural Man can never understand the mind of the Born Again Man. You see in the Natural but I see in the Supernatural.\n 1Jo 3:1 \n How great is the love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are! The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him.\n 1Jo 3:2 \n Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when he appears,[fn1]we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.\n 1Jo 3:3 \n Everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself, just as he is pure.\n Verse 1 can only be experienced through personal interaction with the living God.\n \n Verse 2 makes clear that I don't fully understand what awaits me in Eternity, but that I will know when I see my Lord as I will be like Him.\n \n Verse 3 makes clear that to have this hope makes us a reflection of Him and pure as He is pure because one can only be aware of this hope if he possesses Gods Holy Spirit.

   "\"Eternal security\", yeah right. This character you portray is so violent, irrational and twisted, there is nothing to stop the tyrant from hurting you next, Archangel. You shouldn't feel secure at all. I wouldn't trust the word of a psychopathic killer who likes to watch people burn. Go ahead and be his favourite and trust him, see where it gets you. Good luck. I think the ones who die a quick death in the lake of fire will be the fortunate ones. Those who have to endure eternity with the monster are the ones to be pitied most.\n\n \n Portray? I don't portray God, I serve Him as as faithful a child as I can be. And if you knew Him you would know His true character and that He is the definition of love, compassion and long suffering in this World. But you can't see that because in your soul you dread that He is also a Just God who will, at the proper time meet out Justice to all who have sinned against Him without repentance or remorse. \n \n So you lash out at what you fear. And what you fear is your just reward of sinning against a perfect and holy God. So I am confident in my trust of the God of Israel. For He is the God of life and love and eternity. Only those who reject Him hate Him and fear Him resent what He represents, even if they deny it is fear they are feeling. It is fear of being judged that they are feeling for sure.\n \n And what ever made you think that those who end up in the Lake of Fire will die a quick death? Don't you understand that because we are all made in Gods image that like Him we will never die in eternity? The only question that remains is where we will live, some in Glory with Him and some in hell with the master of this World whom they followed in this life. That's why God came Himself to redeem us. Because no other being in all of eternity could rescue us from our sinful and rebellious condition. \n \n You my friend, are evidence of our free will, and that we wont all receive the free gift of salvation God has paid the price to give to us. And you will rue the day you rejected His Holy gift of love that He wants so badly for you to receive. Even now as you curse and blaspheme Him He loves you and will receive you if you repent and trust Him with your life. But you wont, I understand that. But it needs to be said anyway so you can never say you didn't know the truth was available to you.",

A totally different God would have to be the real one. Otherwise, ultimately, there is no hope, only negativity and darkness.

The simple truth is you can't have it both ways Jake. You can't spend your life hating God and what he represents, and then resent Him for giving you what you have spent your life asking for. \n \n The bottom line in what I am saying is that each of us chooses where we will spend eternity according to our own free will.

It is reliable information that you can bet your soul on. You can rebel against God, curse Him and mock Him in this life, but you are only wasting precious time that could be spent loving Him. Time you will regret wasting forever and a day if you die without receiving the free gift that jesus died on the Cross to give to you.

Can you imagine going into eternity with that part of your lifes journal completely EMPTY? Don't let that happen Jake or it wont be God you spend eternity hating, but it will be yourself whom you will curse and hate for the verse, in their wisdom they became fools will haunt you till the end of time, and beyond.",

Therefore, that decision is made for me, if I am tortured, have violence put upon me. It is certainly against my will. My will has been limited, and is not free. Also, if the debt was already paid, why must I continue to be brutalized? It sounds like the bs reasoning of a violent psychopath. God would know better.\n \n \nFor God to allow you to remain separated from Him whom you have called a murderer and a psychopath right here in this thread is an act of His love for you.

The fact that I don't submit to threats of violence or terror from a psychopath, doesn't mean I will or want those threats to come true. There is a third option: leave me alone altogether, if you can't act decently.\n \n \nSee what I mean? God would never force you into heaven against your will so it is hell you choose, not Him who will send you there.\n\n \n Like I said, I didn't choose the violence and the torture. I reject that. Having true free will would allow to reject this too. \n \n \nYou are right about me. I would be incapable of sending anybody to hell. Just as God is. But God will allow us all to exercise our free will and reject Him in spite of the uncountable times in each of our lives He pulls at us and reaches out to us to respond to His love and to submit to His authority. But if we willingly choose to reject His love, isn't He respecting us by allowing us to not spend eternity with Him? That is the point you are missing Jake. It is you who is rejecting God in this life, not Him who will reject you in the next one.\n\n \n Threats of terror, torture and violence for the sake of submission are not examples of love. I'd expect God to know that. You kind of dodged my question. Do you think it's ethical or moral to stand by and watch someone suffer on and on, like for eternity in a lake of fire, and not do anything to help when one is capable of helping?\n \n \nNeither do I follow Him out of fear. I follow God out of an all encompassing love that fills me to the deepest part of my being. His unconditional love permeates my soul and is just like the river of living water flowing through me as the bible describes it.\n\n \n It's a river of something, all right.\n \n \nMy experience is deep and personal and undeniable. The only fear I could imagine in my life is if I lost what I have in God through Christ. Thankfully that can't happen since His spirit indwells me.\n\n \n Considering the God you describe you would be losing nothing.\n \n \nNot at all. You consistently miss the point.

He hates me. Um no, as I said I did not ask for the acts of torture and terror. No one asks to be the victim of a terrorist or psychopath or hate criminal. \n \n \nGod gave you free will and will give you the desires of your heart if you in fact die to this World hating Him as you do today and are expressing in this thread.

You can't spend your life hating God and what he represents, and then resent Him for giving you what you have spent your life asking for.\n\n \n It's a false dilemma, as I described. Since I don't believe in your particular God, I can be assured in my own belief I am not going there. \n \n \nThe bottom line in what I am saying is that each of us chooses where we will spend eternity according to our own free will. And as you are sitting in outer darkness knowing that ten million years is like one day, and it will all go on, unending forever and a day. What will gnaw and eat at you the most is that you will plainly and clearly understand that it was completely your choice that placed you there and that God actually cried for your loss. That you believed the lies of an enemy you will debate doesn't even exist today. But Gods love is so great that He must respect our free will no matter how much it personally hurts Him.\n\n \n He could choose not to hurt people, if it really hurts him to do so. He'd know this is wrong, being God.\n \n \nWhat I am saying to you is as true as any part of the gospel itself. It is reliable information that you can bet your soul on. You can rebel against God, curse Him and mock Him in this life, but you are only wasting precious time that could be spent loving Him. Time you will regret wasting forever and a day if you die without receiving the free gift that jesus died on the Cross to give to you. The reason you live is not to earn a paycheck Jake, it isn't to get good at your hobby of choice, it isn't do all of the things that people spend their lives doing to no positive end, It is to fellowship with your God who created you in love.\n\n \n You keep repeating that God is love, but what you say logically and rationally is not love. It makes no sense at all. This isn't evidence that I am not spiritual. It simply means I don't share your vision of God, if God exists. I am really rejecting your interpretation of what God may be. \n \n \nAt the end of this life when you only see through spiritual eyes, nothing else will have mattered to you. Can you imagine going into eternity with that part of your lifes journal completely EMPTY? Don't let that happen Jake or it wont be God you spend eternity hating, but it will be yourself whom you will curse and hate for the verse, in their wisdom they became fools will haunt you till the end of time, and beyond.\n\n \n I don't hate myself. I am convinced God would never hate me for using the logic and reason he would have given me. You mostly go on with God is great speeches, but there is no logic here. It's repetitive and mind-numbing. You are asking to accept certain mantras at face value, and not skim beneath the surface by examining with the reason and experience, which would have come from God.",

   "I don't want others to be tortured on my behalf, and I don't choose to be tortured myself. Therefore, that decision is made for me, if I am tortured, have violence put upon me. It is certainly against my will. My will has been limited, and is not free. Also, if the debt was already paid, why must I continue to be brutalized? It sounds like the bs reasoning of a violent psychopath. God would know better.\n \n Hardly. The fact that I don't submit to threats of violence or terror from a psychopath, doesn't mean I will or want those threats to come true. There is a third option: leave me alone altogether, if you can't act decently.\n \n Like I said, I didn't choose the violence and the torture. I reject that. Having true free will would allow to reject this too. \n \n Threats of terror, torture and violence for the sake of submission are not examples of love. I'd expect God to know that. You kind of dodged my question. Do you think it's ethical or moral to stand by and watch someone suffer on and on, like for eternity in a lake of fire, and not do anything to help when one is capable of helping?\n \n It's a river of something, all right.\n \n Considering the God you describe you would be losing nothing.\n \n The kind of God you describe is not worth knowing. He hates me. Um no, as I said I did not ask for the acts of torture and terror. No one asks to be the victim of a terrorist or psychopath or hate criminal. \n \n It's a false dilemma, as I described. Since I don't believe in your particular God, I can be assured in my own belief I am not going there. \n \n He could choose not to hurt people, if it really hurts him to do so.

   "What you are forgetting (despite the fact that it has been mentioned plenty of times before) is:\n \n How can you rebel against something that you believe does not exist?\n\n \n Smiley, deny that airplanes exist all you like, does that mean that they don't? Of course not. So neither does your rejection of the living God matter in reality because in the end you will learn that He most assuredly does exist to your great personal consternation and regret I might add.\n \n \nWhy would god punish someone just because they do not believe in him/her/it? (isn't that just plain petty?)\n\n \n Petty? You're just a regular person, not the maker of all that is; but let's put you in a room full of people as they look through you, ignore your presence, act as if you don't even exist and when you speak they speak over you as if you are non existent. Would you be offended and finally yell at the top of your lungs I AM HERE, ACKNOWLEDGE ME, DON'T IGNORE ME LIKE I DON'T EVEN EXIST!!! And you're just a regular guy like me. I know I would do that under those circumstances.\n \n But God, the author of life and all that is is being petty? You don't do well in looking at situations from another's point of view do you smiley.\n \n \n can you hate something that you believe does not exist?\n How can you resent the authority of something you believe does not exist and therefore has no authority?\n\n \n Then why do you humanists debate so fervently that He doesn't exist? And why do you speak so bitterly about a non existent person? Your side constantly plays both sides of the argument, first claiming He doesn't exist and then reverting to condemning Him because of His judgments on a sinful World. \n \n \nAnother thing you fail to grasp is that the god you claim to worship bears very little resemblance to the god that is portrayed in the NT. So, to reject that god (your petty little personal god) would put noone in any danger at all.\n \n Smiley\n\n \n Now on what do you base that statement smiley? who are you to judge my belief in God as compared to the New Testament God in any way? You don't believe in either of them yet you propose to determine and define what I believe in my heart? What is important is what God believes about what is in my heart regarding Him smiley although I appreciate your concern for my eternal security. \n \n Just so you understand where I'm coming from though, I believe in the pure and simple Gospel that man is a fallen creature who can do nothing ourselves to reunite us with God. It is by grace that we are saved through faith in jesus Christ who died for our sins that we are saved, and not by works so that no man may boast. It is a free gift from God to be freely received by Man and nothing we do can earn it. We must just accept it through Christ who died for our personal sins. \n \n And the result of this born again experience is the reception of Gods Holy Spirit into the new believer who is from that time forth a child of God, a new creature in Christ and no longer a spiritually blind orphan but is a partaker of all of the gifts God has for His children. Just so you know smiley, that is what the bible say's salvation is in the New Testament, and that is what I believe, and that is what I personally experienced. And that is what God wants to happen to every human being on Earth.",

   "There is plenty of  evidence  that God exists, just not proof.\n\n \n I hate it when people who think they are religious put down God that way. God does not exist. God cannot exist. There is not, and cannot be evidence that God exists.\n \n The material world exists. To be God, you have to do better than that.\n \n Fortunately, the question is not whether you believe in God, it is whether you love God, as evidenced by doing justice, loving mercy, and being humble. I know atheists who do (What Paul called being a Torah to oneself). Most of them would hate for me to tell them that, so usually I don't.",
