   "The worldwide complaint today is that the U.S. is the overwhelmingly dominant nation, setting the rules and making everyone jump to its command. Those down on America offer a bitter complaint about U.S. triumphalism. \n \n Well, since we Americans are condemned to be pilloried for our success, let us at least take a moment to glory in it. By every measure, the extent of America's dominance astonishes. \n \n Militarily? Militarily, there has never in the past thousand years been a greater gap between the No. 1 world power and the No. 2. American military spending exceeds that of the next twenty countries combined. Not even the British Empire at its height displayed the superiority shown by American arms today. Our space power (satellites) are unrivaled. Our technology is irresistible.The United States has nuclear and anti-nuclear superiority, the world's overwhelmingly dominant air force, the only truly blue-water navy, and a unique capability to project raw firepower to every corner of the globe. The result is the dominance of a single power unlike anything ever seen in human history. \n \n Economically? The American economy is at the top of the list and almost twice the size of its nearest competitor. We enjoy, almost uniquely, low inflation, low unemployment, record home ownership, and vigorous growth. Put another way, the state of California's economy alone has risen to become the fifth largest in the world (using market exchange-rate estimates), ahead of France and just behind the United Kingdom. \n \n Culturally? Parents the world over vainly fight the tide of T shirts and low-rider jeans, of our rap and rock music and movies, of video and game software pouring out of America and craved by their children. There has been mass culture. But there has never before been mass world culture. Now one is emerging, and it is distinctly American. Why, even the intellectual and commercial boulevard of the future, the Internet, has been set up in our own language and idiom. Everyone speaks American. \n \n Diplomatically? Nothing of significance gets done without us. Consider one of history's rare controlled experiments. In the 1940s, lines were drawn through three peoples--Germans, Koreans and Chinese--one side closely bound to the United States, the other to our adversary Soviet Russia. It turned into a controlled experiment because both states in the divided lands shared a common culture. Fifty years later the results are in. Does anyone doubt the superiority, both moral and material, of West Germany vs. East Germany, South Korea vs. North Korea and Taiwan vs. China. We decide if NATO expands and who gets in. And where we decide not to decide, as in Cambodia and Rawanda, often held up as an example of how the U.N. and regional powers can settle local conflicts without the U.S.--all hell breaks loose. \n \n Just 20 years ago, Paul Kennedy's The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers became an improbable best seller. People did not buy it to learn about the decline of 17th century Spain, however. They bought it to learn about the decline of late-20th century America, the book's heavily promoted topical hook. Indeed, it touched off an intellectual vogue on U.S. decline. The major theme was that Reagan's grandiose revivalism had turned into a grotesque overreaching--wrecking the economy with irresponsible deficits, overstretching us abroad with a mad anticommunism and generally overplaying the weak hand of a country headed downward. \n \n That was then. Where are the decline theorists and defeatist now? In just two decades their hypothesis has suffered one of the most ignominious refutations ever recorded. After Paul Kennedy saw what America did in the Afghan war--a display of fully mobilized, furiously concentrated unipolar power at a distance of 7,000 miles in the \"graveyard of empires\" he not only recanted, he stood in wonder: Nothing has ever existed like this disparity of power; he wrote, nothing. . . . No other nation comes close. . . . Charlemagnes empire was merely western European in its reach. The Roman empire stretched farther afield, but there was another great empire in Persia, and a larger one in China. There is, therefore, no comparison. \n \n All right then. We all--American triumphalists and worldwide complainers--agree on the premise: The center of world power is an unchallenged superpower; the United States, attended by its Western allies. Why are we American triumphalists right that this is as it should be? \n \n First, there is the question of justice. We deserve it. Having fought and won in the last three world wars--I, II and the cold war--we have a right to claim the spoils. And we have a right to the dominance afforded us by our conquest of the \"evil empire,\" coming as it did after a long twilight struggle that America carried on at high peril and huge cost. NATO and other such groupings made for a wonderful show of burden sharing and risk taking. But in truth, the burdens of the cold war were shared very unevenly. It was Washington and New York City that were threatened in the Cuban missile crisis, not Paris and London. It was 57,000 Americans who died in Vietnam, not Germans or Japanese. It was America that expended the blood and treasure--up to 10% of GNP in military spending--that stood down the Soviet Empire and destroyed the very idea of communism. Dominance? Arrogance? We got there the old-fashioned way. We earned it. \n \n Second, there is the question of prudence: American hegemony is good for the world. Why? The modern world, interconnected as it is today, can exist in only two states: reasonably structured or chaotic. Chaos in the global system means no leader, no rules, nothing but contending powers and universal vulnerability. We have had experience with chaos: it was known as the 1930s. It was a Hobbesian universe that plunged the world into catastrophe. \n \n Today the risks, the stakes are even higher: It is of course banal to say that modern technology has shrunk the world. But the obvious corollary, that in a shrunken world the divide between regional superpowers and great powers is radically narrowed, is rarely drawn. Missiles shrink distance. Nuclear (or chemical or biological) devices multiply power. Both can be bought at market. Consequently the geopolitical map is irrevocably altered. Fifty years ago, Germany--centrally located, highly industrial and heavily populated--could pose a threat to world security and to the other great powers. It was inconceivable that a relatively small Middle Eastern state with an almost entirely imported industrial base could do anything more than threaten its neighbors. The central truth of the coming era is that this is no longer the case: relatively small; peripheral and backward states will be able to emerge rapidly as threats not only to regional, but to world security. \n \n Which is why America, in the \"age of terrorism\" is orchestrating the global campaign to denying, disarming, and defending against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In a world where the means of mass destruction can be transported in a suitcase, why should we fully entrust our national security, not to mention world security to Kofi Annan and the rest of the U.N. security councel? \n \n The international system must have a structure. And because the international arena, unlike the ordinary national arena, has no cops, no enforcers, no courts with any real power, the structure must be established and maintained by a leading world power. In the 19th century, the high seas were safe and maritime commerce was routine because of the British navy. The U.S. now plays the role of the British navy everywhere. Whom would those chafing under American hegemony prefer instead? China? Iran? The Russian mafia? \n \n The complainers would prefer, naturally, to see power shared equally among the leading nations and the rules arrived at by consensus. How nice. How Utopian. Multipolar systems do not evolve into happy Elks clubs. They break down rudely into rival alliances and coalitions, like the Triple Entente and the Triple Alliance, the Axis of Evil and the Allies, the Warsaw Pact and NATO, that gave us the calamities and the terrors of this century. \n \n Tennyson dreamed of a parliament of man. Dream on. The League of Nations and the United Nations have proved utterly ineffective. Why, even the European Union, an unprecedented club of like-minded friendly neighbors, was in disarray over the Iraq issue and the question of war and peace. \n \n Why? Simple. Put great powers with diverging interests together, and consensus is almost always impossible to reach. And if not consensus, what? Which nation will long subordinate its own sovereignty to the majority vote of a bunch of rivals? Hence the best, if imperfect, guarantee of international order and safety: the dominance of a benign power. For now and for the foreseeable future, America is it--and the world knows it. \n \n American dominance is a blessing because it has given the world a Pax Americana, an era of international peace and tranquillity unseen in this century, rarely seen in human history. The Great Powers have been corralled into the American \"zone of peace\" or, as with China and Russia, engaged and/or contained. Smaller powers do not dare start regional wars; they have seen what happened to Afghanistan and Iraq (twice). What remains are brushfire wars, most of which the U.S. simply will not strain to quell. \n \n But the world does not live by safety alone. American dominance brings the world something more: the American creed. We are a uniquely ideological nation. We do not define ourselves by race or blood but by adherence to a proposition--DEMOCRACY/FREEDOM--a proposition so humane and attractive that it has, independently of American power, won near universal adherence. From Prague's \"velvet revolution\" to Tiananmen Square, whose Declaration of Independence--whose Statue of Liberty--do demonstrators for freedom turn to for inspiration? \n \n Individual rights, government by consent, protection from arbitrary power, the free exchange of goods and ideas: we did not invent these ideas. We inherited them. We codified them. And now we propagate them. \n \n The world could do alot worse than be dominated by a country so committed to these values and ideas. America came, but it did not come to rule. Unlike other hegemons and would-be hegemons, it does not entertain a grand vision of a new world. No Thousand Year Reich. No New Soviet Man. It has no great desire to remake human nature, to conquer for the extraction of natural resources, or to rule for the simple pleasure of dominion. Our principal aim is to maintain the stability and relative tranquility of the current international system by enforcing, maintaining and extending the current peace. \n \n The new preemption and unilateralism of the Bush doctrine argues explicitly and unashamedly for maintaining unipolarity, for sustaining America's unrivaled superpower dominance for the foreseeable future. It could be a long future, assuming we successfully manage the single greatest threat, namely, weapons of mass destruction in the hands of aggressive rogue or failed states. \n \n This issue is not one of style but of purpose. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld gave the classic formulation of unilateralism when he said (regarding the Afghan war and the war on terrorism, but the principle is universal), \"the mission determines the coalition.\" We take our friends where we find them, but only in order to help us in accomplishing the mission. The mission comes first, and we decide it. \n \n Contrast this with the classic case study of multilateralism at work: the U.S. decision in February 1991 to conclude the Gulf War. As the Iraqi army was fleeing, the first Bush Administration had to decide its final goal: the liberation of Kuwait or regime change in Iraq. It stopped at Kuwait. Why? Because, as Brent Scowcroft has explained, going further would have fractured the coalition, gone against our promises to allies and violated the UN resolutions under which we were acting. \"Had we added occupation of Iraq and removal of Saddam Hussein to those objectives\", wrote Scowcroft in the Washington Post on October 16, 2001, \"... our Arab allies, refusing to countenance an invasion of an Arab colleague, would have deserted us.\" The mistake was the coalition defined the mission. \n \n We have learned from our past mistakes, but we still require the aggressive and confident application of unipolar power rather than falling back, as we did in the 1990s, on paralyzing multilateralism. The future of the unipolar era hinges on whether America is governed by those who wish to retain, augment and use unipolarity to advance not just American but global ends, or whether America is governed by those who wish to give it up-either by allowing unipolarity to decay as they pull up the drawbridge to Fortress America, or by passing on the burden by gradually transferring power to multilateral institutions as heirs to American hegemony. The challenge to our unipolarity is not from the outside but from the inside. The choice is ours. To impiously paraphrase Benjamin Franklin: History has given you an empire, if you will keep it. -Dr. Charles Krauthammer",

Real concerns at the time about al Qaeda's ties to Saddam--\"whereas members of al-Qaida, an organization bearing responsibility for attacks on the United States, its citizens, and interests, including the attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, are known to be in Iraq.\" Legitimate fears of terrorism--\"whereas Iraq continues to aid and harbor other international terrorist organizations, including organizations that threaten the lives and safety of American citizens.\" So please, save the \"Bush lied\" spin. It's a whipped horse thats tired and coming up lame\n \n \n The last refocus was bringing freedom and democracy to Iraqis,\n \n Gee, thats funny, I remember before a missile left it's silo, or a boot hitting the ground, the mission being called \"Iraqi Freedom\" Can you explain that? Thought not!\n \n which has resulted in civil war, death squads and ideological alignment of Iraq with Iran. \n \n And because Iraqs shia and sunni are in a civil war with \"death squads\" being their weapon, somehow you find a way to spin it so it's the United States fault? It's our fault, that given the chance at freedom and democracy, they choose to resolve their differences with bombs and murder rather then debate? Thats a load of XXXX! And could you please expand on your \"ideological alignment\" statement. It was vague at best\n \n A majority of the US public is sick of our self-serving actions in Iraq, but you seem to be one of the 30% of Americans who believe destroying a country under the premise of democracy at gunpoint is a good thing.\n \n Self-serving?? You have yet to answer my question. How is spending blood and treasure, with the aim of bringing freedom and democracy to 26 million Iraqis, get labeled by you as \"Self-serving?\" 30%??? Last I saw, Bush's approval numbers were at 47%! And just who is \"destroying the country?\" Those aren't americans blowing up mosques, builidings, and people. Nice try though!\n \n You obviously don't know much about our economy other than cooked government numbers, so I won't bother commenting on a post not directed to you.\n \n Cooked government numbers??? Sounds like a conspiracy theory. . .Something the \"far left\" is famous for. There are no \"cooked numbers\" Everything our government spends money on goes through our Republican and Democrat congress. . .So you can brown bag that noise!\n \n You sound like another blind patriot who unquestionably follows whatever policy statement politicians throw you to rationalize their actions.\n\n \n You sound like another \"far left\" moonbat whose only aim is to mislead and spread propaganda.

   "Look for china to increase their debt holding as their currency is fixed to our dollar...the EU (biggest holder of our debt) and many Arab nations are pulling out because the risk is too high and our dollar is supposed to tank soon.\n\n \n Nope. The chinese are backing off on US debt holdings. In fact, they have liquidated over 100 billion in US dollar holdings (currency reserves) in the last 90 days and converted it to gold. \n \n China wants to keep the yuan where it is as far as valuation goes until their banking system matures enough to generate massive amounts of fiat capital in a short time period. Evne now, the yuan is consdiered to be 50% undervalued. When they actually float it, they will generate HUGE amounts of fiat money in short order. The last I heard from my \"china expert\", they actually intend to DOUBLE their money supply with the float of the yuan. They expect this will change the value of the yuan, so instead of shooting up 50%, it will only shoot up 30%, BUT, they will have twice as much money :)\n \n There have been MASSIVE currency trades out of Asia lately that can only be China dumping dollars. British, French, and Japanese central banks have been buying them like crazy trying to defend their currency reserves. \n \n Friday was an incredibly interesting trading day for currency. The British attempted to defend the dollar at 1.2700 but a large asian order blew through that like it was nothing. They then tried again at 1.2800, but a large order out of the ME blew through that. Finally, they managed ot take a stand at about 1.2820 that held. End of week profit taking and reduces sales volume then saw the dollar rise in value to 1.2780 against the Euro.\n \n Defendign the dollar like the good little american lap dog sthat they are cost the british about $40 billion on friday, and they are about out of currency reserves to play. The chairman of the ECB was quoted as saying \"If the Asian market is no longer interested in holding the dollar, there is no point in anybody else trying to defend it\".\n \n Short term traders close positions on fridays, whcih always gives the dollar a little boost in markets where people are bearish on the dollar. \n \n The two biggest movers of the dolalr this week are expected to be US housing data out tomorrow (existing home sales) and the senates vote on protectionist measures (tarriffs) against china. Even if the measures don't pass, a strogn showing of support for them are expected to expose the dollar to significant downside risk. If the housing data comes in worse than expected, all bets are off, as the market perception seems to be that a failure in the US housing market will lead to a depression in the US (NOT recession, depression). \n \n Personally, I am on the fence as far as housing data goes. I have a feeling that the expectations are a little on the high side since we are essentaily looking at price deflation in the housing sector, and the feeling I seem to get from most people is that home purchasing decisions have been put on hold while they wait and see what develops. This is well supported by last months mortgage application data. \n \n the value of the dollar being dependant primarily on housing data is a poor sign on many fronts. First, it is pretty rare anymore to find an analyst that is still trying to convince people that there is no housing bubble. That has largely been established as fact. Second, the fact that traders and CBs are willing to bail on us based soley on our housing data shows that they do not buy into a soft landing scenario, and that they doubt our ability to weather a housing crash.\n \n \n Overall, I would say that the outlook is pretty bleak.",

Old Charlie\nNope!\n \n Uh uh!\n \n The United States has been torn down to a weak and puny state thanks to the likes of George Walker Bush and his lackeys. He has reduced us to the point where we are under the thumb of Communist Red China and fascist Saudi Arabia.\n \n We of the Democratic Party of the United State of America have a lot of work ahead of us to restore the tarnished glory of our nation, to restore it to its rightful status as a respected international leader, to restore the historic ideals of our great nation.",

   "In most every case posters known as fiscal conservatives are responding to the thread. May I inquire as to your profession and depth of knowledge regarding US economic circumstances?\n\n \n Fiscal Conservatives, Government Conservatives, Goldwater Conservatives are all considered liberal to Republicans who are in many ways, anti-Conservative. \n \n Jedi is engaging in the typical behavior a republican does when he runs into a conservative. Mouth off like a idiot and declare victory while calling your opponent a liberal and hopping neither they or your audience knows what a conservative is. \n \n I have to yet to meet someone who has strong economic or business background who doesn't think that China is probably one of the 400 lb gorillas in today's world. Their mere capacity to screw our debt issues up makes us in many ways, their b***h.",

   "Only European Greens appear to be aware of it. In most disputable question of American anti-missile defence system on European territories the Green parties are most actively opposing the deployment of the system or trying to link it to NATO at least. \n America has had a free hand in Europe till now and she wants this to continue. Some politicians can't answer the question, \"Why do Americans need this deployment right now?\". There's no any imminent threat either from Iran or anybody else. Only one answer suggests itself in the context. Americans are in a hurry to plant elements of their national defence system in Europe... until it's too late. \n I don't mean any missile strike from Iran. It amounts to a myth of Iraqi mass destruction weapons just. Btw this myth and the war which followed was the first effective blow to divide Europeans. Now Americans here to hit one more blow and on the same target - European might and unity. They just don't want to wait until EU gains strength and becomes really one whole in possession of her own defence system without any American component perhaps. \n America is fearful not of Iraq but of the united Europe. That's bitter piece of truth.",
