   "The liquid inside young coconuts can be used as a substitute for \n blood* plasma.\n\n \n True. \n \n \nNo piece of paper can be folded in half more than seven (7) times.\n\n \n False. It becomes difficult, but not impossible. There is a theory that a sheet (of anything) cannot be folded more that NINE times. \n \n \nDonkeys kill more people annually than plane crashes.\n\n \n False. There's actually no data to support that claim. While there is plenty of data on airplane crashes, there is no data on \"donkey deaths.\" Now, if you were to say more people were INJURED by donkeys, that's probably true.\n \n \n \nYou burn more calories sleeping than you do \n watching television. \n\n \n False. According to the AHA, a 150-pound person burns 71 calories watching tv for an hour, and 64 calories sleeping for an hour. Even at eight hours, sleeping burns fewer calories. \n \n \nOak trees do not produce acorns until they are fifty (50) years of age or older.\n\n \n False*. While IN GENERAL, white oak trees normally don't produce acorns until they're fifty years of age, if they have good location they'll produce at 20 years. Red oaks produce at 10-25 years.\n \n \nThe first product to have a bar code was Wrigley's gum. \n\n \n False. It was the first product to be SCANNED, but not the first to have a barcode.\n \n \nThe king of hearts is the only king without a mustache.\n\n \n Sort of. He orignally DID have a moustache. \n \n \nAmerican Airlines saved $40,000 in 1987 by \n eliminating one (1) olive from each salad served in first-class. \n\n \n True. \n \n \nVenus is the only planet that rotates clockwise. \n\n \n Sort of. Venus has a retrograde rotation, but there is a possibility that Uranus (no jokes, please) does too.\n \n \nApples, not caffeine, are more efficient at waking \n you up in the morning. \n\n \n True.\n \n \nMost dust particles in your house are made from dead skin. \n\n \n False. It's a whole bunch of ****.\n \n \nThe first owner of the Marlboro Company died of lung cancer. \n So did the* first \"MarlboroMan.\" \n\n \n Not really. There is no \"Marlboro Company.\" You're thinking of Phillip Morris Co. No one really knows what caused the first owner's death (in 1873). Two actors who played the \"MM\" died of lung cancer, but neither was the first.\n \n \nWalt Disney was afraid of mice. \n\n \n True.\n \n \nPearls melt in vinegar. \n\n \n True.* They actually don't melt, they dissolve. It's a chemical process, not a heat process.\n \n \nThe three most valuable brand names on earth:* Marlboro, \n Coca Cola, and Budweiser, in that order. \n\n \n False. #1 Coca-Cola ($72.5 billion); #2 Microsoft ($70.2 billion); #3 IBM ($53.2 billion)\n \n \n \nIt is possible to lead a cow upstairs...but not downstairs. \n\n \n True.\n \n \nA duck's quack doesn't echo, and no one knows why. \n\n \n False. A duck's quack causes \"destructive interference\", which essentially means that what you're hearing is both the original sound AND the echo at the same time.\n \n \nDentists have recommended that a toothbrush be kept at least six (6) feet \n away from a toilet to avoid airborne particles resulting from the \n flush. (I keep my toothbrush in the living room now!) \n\n \n Sort of. They do recommend it, but they're reasoning if flawed.\n \n \nRichard Millhouse Nixon was the first U.S. president whose name contains all* the letters from the word \"criminal.\"* The second? \n William Jefferson Clinton. \n\n \n EDITED: True.
