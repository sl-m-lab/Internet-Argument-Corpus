   "Will we see a healthcare reform bill passed this weekend?\n \n Congressmen John Conyers and Dennis Kucinich have released the following joint statement:\n \n \nPublished on Friday, November 6, 2009 by CommonDreams.org\n Co-Authors Question Stand Alone Vote on National Single Payer\n by Dennis Kucinich & John Conyers\n Dear Friends, \n \n We thank you for your continued devotion to the cause of health care for All Americans. We have worked together for many years to write, promote and campaign for HR676, a single payer, not for profit health care system. Your work, in communities across America, has been instrumental in helping at least ten states create single payer movements, with many more states to come. \n \n Tomorrow, the House of Representatives is scheduled to consider a single payer bill. As the two principal co-authors of the Conyers single payer bill, we want to offer a strong note of caution about tomorrow's vote. \n \n The bill presented tomorrow will not be HR676. While we are happy to relinquish authorship of a single payer bill to any member who can do better, we do not want a weak bill brought forward in a hostile climate to unwittingly accomplish what would be interpreted as a defeat for single payer. \n \n Here are the facts: There has been no debate in Congress over HR676. There has not been a single mark-up of the bill. Single payer was \"taken off the table\" for the entire year by the White House and by congressional leaders. There has been no reasonable period of time to gather support in the Congress for single payer. Many members accepted a \"robust public option\" as the alternative to single payer and now that has disappeared. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has scored the bill scheduled for a vote tomorrow in a manner which is at odds with many credible assumptions, meaning that it will appear to cost way too much even though we know that true single payer saves money since one of every three dollars in the health care system goes to administrative costs caused by the insurance companies. Is this really the climate in which we want a test vote? \n \n While state single payer movements are already strong, the national single payer movement is still growing. Many progressives in Congress, ourselves included, feel that calling for a vote tomorrow for single payer would be tantamount to driving the movement over a cliff. The thrill of the vote would disappear quickly when the result would be characterized not as a new beginning for single payer but as an end. Such a result would be seen as proof that Congress need not pay attention to efforts to restore in Conference Committee the right of states to pursue single payer without fear of legal attacks by insurance companies. \n \n We are always grateful for your support. We are now asking you to join us in suggesting to congressional leaders that this is not the right time to call the roll on a stand-alone single payer bill. That time will come. And when it does there will not be any doubt of the outcome. This system of health care injustice will not be able to endure forever. We are pledged to make sure of that. \n \n Sincerely, \n Congressmen John Conyers and Dennis Kucinich\n \n Dennis Kucinich is a Congressman (D) from Ohio. John Conyers is a Congressman (D) from Michigan.\n\n \n Healthcare-NOW! with other health care as a human right organizations are releasing this one:\n \n \nOn the eve of what could have been the first vote on single-payer legislation in our nation's history, we have just learned that because of last minute developments, the vote and debate on Congressman Weiner's single-payer amendment will not happen.\n \n Speaker Pelosi received a statement from Rep. Kucinich and Rep. Conyers, the co-authors of HR 676, that they do not think that this is the right time for a vote on national single-payer legislation. They made this statement despite the extensive mobilization in support of this vote across the country. In addition, Speaker Pelosi felt that offering a single-payer amendment would open the floodgates to amendments proposed to limit abortion funds, restrict immigrant access to healthcare, and other regressive legislation.\n \n Let us remember that the potential vote on Congressman Weiner's single-payer amendment resulted from holding fast to our principles of universal, comprehensive healthcare with no financial barriers. These efforts have brought truth and clarity to a national debate on healthcare reform that has been polluted by the corporate influence over Congress. While the private insurance industry has sent 3,000 lobbyists to Capitol Hill this year, spending 1.4 million dollars a day to shape reform that protects their profits, our calls, faxes, and demonstrations have created the momentum to bring legislation based on HR 676 to the floor of the House and Senate.\n \n The vote for Congressman Weiner's single-payer amendment would have allowed advocates to have their representatives on record as single-payer supporters.\n \n But this legislative battle is not yet over. Our focus can now turn to two remaining efforts for single-payer in this Congress. Sen. Bernie Sanders will introduce S 703 in coming weeks, and we understand that he is considering editing it to be more like HR 676. We will have the opportunity again to see the first ever vote on single-payer in this Congress. In addition, Rep. Kucinich's amendment to allow states to more easily implement a single-payer system may be reinserted into the bill during the conference committee between the House and Senate.\n \n All of these efforts are crucial to building the movement for the only solution to our healthcare crisis - single-payer national healthcare.\n \n If this Congress passes inadequate legislation, there will no doubt be emboldened state movements in the coming years. We welcome them. But let us not forget the movement to push our federal legislators to meet the demands of the people, not roll that responsibility onto the states. Healthcare-NOW! and the Leadership Conference for Guaranteed Health Care remains committed to a national, single-payer solution to the healthcare crisis. Comprehensive, quality healthcare is a right that should be extended to every U.S. resident.\n \n At this important time, let us not forget how far we have come. Either now or later, a single-payer national healthcare system must come to the table. We will keep building the movement to make that happen.\n \n For healthcare justice,\n \n Healthcare-NOW!\n Physicians for a National Health Program\n Progressive Democrats of America\n Public Citizen\n Healthcare for All Texas\n Western PA Coalition for Single Payer\n Alliance for Democracy\n\n \n Lastly, the New York Times reports that Anthony Weiner is stepping back from his amendment so that the Democrat health bill can be passed, perhaps this weekend:\n \n Democrat Gives Up Single-Payer Measure to Back Party Leaders - Prescriptions Blog - NYTimes.com\n \n The good news in this, is that it is NOT a pet issue. This does show that the single payer movement has enough clout over the health industry's money in Congress to lay a conclusive marker on whether or not the Democrats' health bill can get through. All this without even having a seat at the discussion table in Congress.\n \n I can't muster enthusiasm to support Conyers' and Kucinich's luke-warm (anyway) call to action, but it looks like Weiner is making that unnecessary, and I wouldn't stand in the way of a bill that the New York Times says is going to cover 36 million more Americans under Medicaid and government subsidies for private or the new public option. Though this is not Medicare for ALL by a long shot.\n \n As Reverend Jackson says, \"Keep hope alive!\" We shall prevail because reason, justice and righteousness is on our side.\n \n Healthcare as a human right is a moral and historical and global imperative. Just about every industrialized nation today has universal health care except the United States. With most of those nations far outpacing us in the delivery of care and cost-effectiveness, and some of the poorest implementing those systems, easily competitive with our own, and though we spend more than anyone.\n \n We too will have to join the future. We shall overcome.\n \n YouTube - Bruce Springsteen - We shall overcome (Live)",

Like I said, I'm not going to oppose another 36 million Americans getting covered. But a key question in the left is: Better To Pass It Or Better To Trash It?\n \n Here, a single payer health care for all physician says throw the whole thing away. \n \n \nHealth Care Reform 2009: No Bill is Better Than a Bad Bill\n Posted by John Geyman MD on Thursday, Nov 5, 2009\n If you were to believe the hype that accompanied its release, you might think that it would be as important as Medicare and Social Security. The New York Times concluded that &#8220;This bill will take a long stride toward universal coverage while remaining fiscally responsible.&#8221; Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman added: &#8220;The political environment is as favorable for reform as it&#8217;s likely to get. The legislation on the table isn&#8217;t perfect, but it&#8217;s as good as anyone could reasonably have expected.&#8221;\n \n But this bill is not good enough to pass. It will not make a big enough difference in addressing the three main problems requiring reform&#8211;containing the spiraling costs of health care, providing universal access to affordable health care, and improving its quality. If we look at the provisions of this 1,990-page bill concerning just the first two of these three goals, we see that it will fail to deliver real reform.\n \n After all of the political compromises along the way that have led to the introduction of the new bill (HR 3962), on the positive side we can say that it will introduce some limited reforms to the health insurance market, expand health insurance to some of the uninsured (primarily by expansion of Medicaid and by often-inadequate government subsidies to individuals and small employers for the purchase of private insurance); and help to address some other problems, such as the growing shortage of primary care providers.\n \n But the negative side far outweighs the positive:\n \n &#8226; Although supporters of the new House bill claim that it would expand coverage for as many as 30 million uninsured, we are actually likely to see an increase in the number of uninsured in coming years for these kinds of reasons&#8212;as costs keep going up, many Americans will be forced to drop their present coverage because of inability to afford rapidly rising costs of premiums, deductibles and co-payments; there is no guarantee that the uninsured will be able to afford new private coverage (even with subsidies, which won&#8217;t kick in for another four years); and expansion of Medicaid will not take place until 2013 (many states are already pushing back with concerns that the their recession-strained budgets will not allow them to pay their share in adding to their Medicaid programs, potentially leaving millions of the poorest Americans uninsured.\n \n &#8226; There are no effective cost containment mechanisms built into the bill, either for the costs of health insurance or for health care itself. As it whines about weakening of the individual mandate that will likely limit some of its big increase in the insurance market, the health insurance industry is already warning that sharp premium increases will result. The most the bill will do is to require disclosure and review of premium increases, without any regulatory teeth. Although the bill would set up a Health Benefits Advisory Committee to recommend a minimal essential benefits package (with four tiers), insurance industry lobbyists will argue for the most minimal levels of coverage, and we can anticipate an exponential growth in underinsurance. Moreover, there are no price controls to be applied anywhere in the system, except perhaps in authorizing the government to negotiate drug prices with manufacturers. But that provision will almost certainly not clear the Senate, where we can expect even less concern for affordability and prices.\n \n &#8226; Although the public option has been the target of intense controversy, it will play a negligible role in health care reform. The CBO has concluded that it would cover no more than 6 million Americans, just two percent of the population, in 2013, and will cost more than private programs, mostly due to adverse selection in attracting sicker individuals and its inability to set reimbursement rates for physicians and hospitals as is done by Medicare. Moreover, middle-income families may be required to spend 15 to 18 percent of their income on insurance premiums and co-payments.\n \n &#8226; HR 3962 will not result in making health care more affordable, despite allocating some $605 billion over ten years for subsidies to low- and middle-income Americans to buy insurance on Exchanges. We can count on continued increases in the cost of health insurance as far as the eye can see, together with less actuarial value of coverage.\n \n &#8226; Buried in the fine print of this monster bill are many provisions that will benefit corporate stakeholders in the medical industrial complex on the backs of patients and their families. These examples make the point:\n \n &#8226; Although medical loss ratios (MLR) (the proportion of premium revenue actually spent on medical care) are specified at a minimum of 85 percent, this loophole has been added&#8211;&#8221;while making sure that such a change doesn&#8217;t further destabilize the current individual health insurance market.&#8221; By way of comparison, the Senate Commerce Committee has found that the average MLR for the largest insurers in the individual market is only 74 percent, with 26 percent of premium revenue going to marketing, administrative overhead and profits.\n \n &#8226; Although the bill would create a much-needed Center for Comparative Effectiveness Research, it would have no say over reimbursement and coverage policies. As the bill says, it &#8220;contains protections to ensure that research findings are not construed to mandate coverage, reimbursement or other policies to any public or private payer.&#8221;\n \n In sum, this $1.055 trillion plan over ten years will not fix the major problems of cost and affordable access to health care in our deteriorating system, will add new layers of bureaucracy and complexity to the present system, is not fiscally responsible, and is not sustainable.\n \n What to do now? Rather than accept an unworkable bill that is politically expedient, we would be better off to make a major course change. That vote could take place as early as tomorrow.\n \n If that fails, shelving this bill would be the best option. Until a few days ago, I would have added that lawmakers should be pressed to retain the amendment proposed by Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio) to allow states to experiment with single-payer plans, as a number of states would like to do (e.g. California, Colorado, Illinois, Maine, New Mexico, New York and Pennsylvania). Although that amendment had already been passed by a rare bipartisan vote of 27-19 in the House Education and Labor Committee, it has been stripped from the bill.\n \n The best first option would be to call for a floor vote, as originally promised by the House Speaker Pelosi, for the amendment proposed by Anthony Weiner (D-NY) to substitute HR 676, a single-payer proposal, for HR 3962. If that fails, shelving this bill would be the best option, but if that is not possible, lawmakers should be pressed to retain the amendment proposed by Dennis Kucinich (D-OH) to allow states to experiment with single-payer plans, as a number of states would like to do (eg. California, Colorado, Illinois, Maine, New Mexico, New York and Pennsylvania).\n \n That amendment has already been passed by a rare bipartisan vote of 27-19 in the House Education and Labor Committee. Whether a health care bill survives the end game in both chambers of Congress in this session is still up in the air. If a bill is finally enacted into law, however, it will be ineffective in remedying the big problems of cost and access to health care. We should be gearing up for an intense effort in 2010 to push for real health care reform&#8211;Medicare for All.\n \n Dr. John Geyman is professor emeritus of family medicine at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle, a past president of Physicians for a National Health Program and author of &#8220;Do Not Resuscitate: Why the Health Insurance Industry Is Dying, and How We Must Replace It.&#8221; Buy John Geyman&#8217;s Books at: Books for an informed democracy: Chomsky, Zinn, Harbury, Aristide.

PNHP's John Geyman called on the House to shelve Obamacare.\n \n \"The negatives far outweigh the positives,\" Geyman wrote.Yesterday, Congressman Eric Massa (D-NY), a lead single payer advocate in the House, said he would vote against Obamacare.\n \n And it wouldn't matter what kind of pressure the White House or President Obama put on him to change his mind.\n \n \"I have respect for the chief executive, but I don't work for him,\" Massa said. \"I work for people of the 29th Congressional District.\"\n \n \"At the highest level this bill will enshrine in law the monopolistic powers of the private health insurance industry,\" Massa said yesterday in a telephone press conference. \"There's no other way to look at it.\"\n \n The Rochester Democrat and Chronicle reported that Massa spent the last week studying 1,990-page H.R. 3962.\n \n Massa said that t the bill \"fails to address the fundamental question before the American people, and that is, how do you control the costs of health care?\"\n \n Massa is the only solid no vote who turned on Obama because it gave too much to the insurance industry.\n \n There are two other single payer advocates - Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) and Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio) - who are undecided and may join Massa in the \"no\" camp when the House votes comes down - possibly as early as tonight.\n \n In late July 2009, virtually the entire Congressional Progressive Caucus wrote a letter saying that anything less than a public option tied to Medicare rates was \"unacceptable.\"\n \n But most have reneged on that position - including such progressives as Donna Edwards (D-Maryland) and Raul Grajalva (D-Arizona) - under pressure from Obama and the White House. @ commondreams.org\n",

You raised a false side track which was in itself shot full of holes. Only in your own mind could you even begin to believe you raised the victory flag in your self constructed strawman. Now what logic is there in having a bill that no one knows what is in it? How many new bureaus does it establish sucking tax dollars down the bottomless rat hole while providing nothing? What penalties and fees does it establish for non complience? On the other hand you are stating that we should buy this pig in a poke and rejoice.

   "Can anyone who is supporting socialized/government controlled healthcare show where this takeover is allowed in the constitution? NO? But who cares, right? As long as they can say it's good for us, that is all that matters.\n \n But can they prove it's good for us in the final analysis? Not a chance. That's why they continue to spew the same lies and distortion of the reality of what this bill will accomplish and ignore every question which they can't honestly answer like these five.\n \n 1) For example, how can they say they are increasing healthcare services for the old and poor when they have cut FOUR HUNDRED PLUS MILLION DOLLARS from MEDICARE'S BUDGET? \n \n 2) And how can they say it will cost less than is currently being paid by consumers when the costs will be around 7,000$ a year for singles and as much as 14,000$ a year for families? \n \n 3) And how can they say it isn't a forced plan when people and employers will be penalized, as in FINED for not participating according to government regulatory requirements? \n \n 4) And if this legislation is so important NOW, and so critically needed today in order to ensure the health and welfare of americans TODAY, then why isn't it going to kick in until AFTER the 2012 election? Does Obama think we are so stupid that we can't see that he doesn't want the negative impact of this losers legislation to implode publicly for all to see until after he is hoping to be re-elected? \n \n 5) And most importantly for the sake of these inane threads that antonia continues to spam us with, my question to her is, is she so brain dead that she is unable to ask these same questions and to reconsider her position until she can get honest answers from the government proponents of this criminal and anti-american bill? I wont expect an answer of course since I understand antonia. But the argument needed to be framed for the rational members. emoticon_xagree\n \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwFzis6cRNo",
