   "Well, we're batting 1000 - looks like he did it again.\n\n \n Being a long-time cycling fan, I loved the fact that OTL had nightly in-depth broadcasts of the day's stage. For Lance to go from not willing an individual stage in 2003 to winning 5? in 2004 and 64? in total is another incredible feat.\n I believe that Fitness magazine may be touting him as the greatest athlete ever. Some interesting facts: Lance Armstrong's resting heart rate is 32; he has a 130% lung capacity when compared to an average person.\n This AM, I listened to two radio DJ's discussing the claim that Lance is the greatest athlete. They argued that Michael Jordon was a more deserving choice. They said that if you gave MJ 2 years to learn cycling, he'd beat LA in a race, but if you taught LA basketball, he'd get killed.\n I had to turn the radio at that point. MJ would get smoked on the bike so badly that it would be a joke. For one thing, the sports take differing muscle types. B-ball players need fast-firing muscles in order to jump and sprint. Cyclists need slow-firing muscles for their endurance. The two, while not totally mutually exclusive, aren't found to nearly the same degree in any given individual.\n Way to go, Lance. You showed the frogs who's #1 once again. emoticon_xgood",
