If the first pregnancy was interrupted, the likelihood of subsequent breast cancer was right up there with the likelihood of lung cancer after a lifetime of smoking. (The study is obviously not politically correct, so I've seen no mention of it on this side of the Atlantic.)

No, because she doesn't know how to take care of one.

   "The 13yr old girl was ruled to be smart enough to know if she wants an abortion or not. However, if she is smart enough to get an abortion then she is smart enough to have sex, know the consequences, and know how to take care of a baby. I honeslty don't think the 13yr old girl knows the consequences of her actions at all and therefore shouldn't have sex, get an abortion, or take care of a baby. Obviously she had sex and got pregnant. Now she needs to learn the consequence of this action much the same way I learn from my mistakes. Should she keep the baby? No, because she doesn't know how to take care of one. If you let her get an abortion you are just saying that there are no consequences to your mistakes because we can always cover them up or make them easier for you. This really gets me steamed. She had sex, she needs to know what happens when you do have sex. I bet she will have many more abortions after this because there is no consequence to being irresponsible anymore.\n\n \n \n So your saying here that \"making\" her have the baby would be the only \"punishment\".

   "Lets say for example that when i was 15 i did have an abortion and now 7 years have gone by. I would have been able to use my scholarship to art school and would have gotton my degree, had a great job by now, looked back and said \"i would have a 7 year old now... i could have supported her damn it\" and felt regret. It's all how you look at it I guess. Not that right now i am some bum on the street or anything, because i am not and my daughter lives a very spoiled life, but some people would choose the latter and have thier life dreams and goals, to most people who feel they can't support thier child, i agree with that. People do have a right to live thier lives the way they want to, even if they have abortions and believe in capital punishment, it's an american right. If you don't like abortions, don't have one.\nSo you support people being selfish? Listen to what you wrote...You say that instead of seeing a pregnancy as an opportunity you see it is a threat and thus kill the baby inorder to satisfy your own wants. That is selfish anyway you look at it. You can always go to school and do the things you want and have the baby. Will it be harder? YES, however, you made a choice to have sex. I guess none of you took classes in self-leadership. A baby that was unplanned shouldn't be viewed as a threat because the \"obstacle\" is more of an opportunity to show what you can do. A person that has a kid at 15 and makes time to go to college is a hero...a women that gets the abortion is selfish. I think that a want is not a right and that you have a right to live which is more then your want to live your life the way you want to. The baby deserves to live.\n \n \nSo your saying here that \"making\" her have the baby would be the only \"punishment\". I agree with you that she isnt responsable enough and doesnt know the \"consequences\" of what she did, so she obviously wont beable to care for a baby.

I said the 13yr old should deal with the consequences...that is far from a punishment. It is more of a lesson in life, there are no quick easy fixes. The only punishment would be to the baby that gets aborted. The girl has sex and punishs the baby by death...that makes no sense. She needs to face consequences the way everyone else does, this is how we learn. This goes beyond abortion too. Pain, depression, stress are all normal things people should feel. Not everything is happy flowers. This is why Prozac makes me mad too. This fixes nothing for most patients. People need to stop looking for quick fixes and deal with the problems they are dealt. Just because it is hard doesn't mean you don't do it. \n \n Do you view problems as opportunities or threats?",

   "I think that every mistake has a consequence and by letting her make the decision to have an abortion is like telling her that having sex at 13 is ok because you can just get an abortion. How about showing her that there is a consequence to her action. She won't be having sex again if she has that baby. Not only that, a life will have been saved. I don't think her life would be ruined unless she ruins it. Obstacles don't ruin someones life....Your own personal choices do. You are right, she isn't mature enough to have sex, take care of a baby, or be pregnant (have a baby), however she is mature enough to learn what a consequence is.\nOh, so you're saying that a 13-year-old CHILD has an adult-level reasoning and maturity to know how to deal with sexuality. \n \n And, by the way, I don't believe it is appropriate for a 13-year-old CHILD to be engaged in sexual activities. Where was her parent? Where was the State of Florida, her parent in this case, the State of Florida under the governorship of Jeb Bush? Why did her parent, the State of Florida, neglect to notify the proper authorities in a timely manner that this CHILD had gone missing?\n \n How about showing the State of Florida and Jeb Bush that there is a consequence for their neglect of this CHILD?",

   "Abstract \n Top\n Abstract\n Methods\n Results\n Interpretation\n References\n \n \n Background: Controversy exists about whether abortion or childbirth is associated with greater psychological risks. We compared psychiatric admission rates of women in time periods from 90 days to 4 years after either abortion or childbirth. \n \n Methods: We used California Medicaid (Medi-Cal) records of women aged 13-49 years at the time of either abortion or childbirth during 1989. Only women who had no psychiatric admissions or pregnancy events during the year before the target pregnancy event were included (n = 56 741). Psychiatric admissions were examined using logistic regression analyses, controlling for age and months of eligibility for Medi-Cal services. \n \n Results: Overall, women who had had an abortion had a significantly higher relative risk of psychiatric admission compared with women who had delivered for every time period examined. Significant differences by major diagnostic categories were found for adjustment reactions (odds ratio [OR] 2.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-4.1), single-episode (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.3-2.9) and recurrent depressive psychosis (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.3-3.5), and bipolar disorder (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.5-6.0). Significant differences were also observed when the results were stratified by age. \n \n Interpretation: Subsequent psychiatric admissions are more common among low-income women who have an induced abortion than among those who carry a pregnancy to term, both in the short and longer term.",

   "Abortion Is Four Times Deadlier\n Than Childbirth \n \n New Studies Unmask High Maternal Death Rates From Abortion \n \n David C. Reardon, Ph.D.\n Abortion advocates, relying on inaccurate maternal death data in the United States, routinely claim that a woman's risk of dying from childbirth is six, ten, or even twelve times higher than the risk of death from abortion. \n \n In contrast, abortion critics have long contended that the statistics relied upon for maternal mortality calculations have been distorted and that the broader claim that \"abortion is many times safer than childbirth\" completely ignores high rates of other physical and psychological complications associated with abortion. Now a recent, unimpeachable study of pregnancy-associated deaths in Finland has shown that the risk of dying within a year after an abortion is several times higher than the risk of dying after miscarriage or childbirth.(1) \n \n This well-designed record-based study is from STAKES, the statistical analysis unit of Finland's National Research and Development Center for Welfare and Health. In an effort to evaluate the accuracy of maternal death reports, STAKES researchers pulled the death certificate records for all the women of reproductive age (15-49) who died between 1987 and 1994--a total of 9,192 women. They then culled through the national health care data base to identify any pregnancy-related events for each of these women in the 12 months prior to their deaths. \n \n Since Finland has socialized medical care, these records are very accurate and complete. In this fashion, the STAKES researchers identified 281 women who had died within a year of their last pregnancy. The unadjusted mortality rate per 100,000 cases was 27 for women who had given birth, 48 for women who had miscarriages or ectopic pregnancies, and 101 for women who had abortions. \n \n The researchers then calculated the age-adjusted odds ratio of death, using the death rate of women who had not been pregnant as the standard equal to one. Table 1 shows that the age-adjusted odds ratio of women dying in the year they give birth as being half that of women who are not pregnant, whereas women who have abortions are 76 percent more likely to die in the year following abortion compared to non-pregnant women. Compared to women who carry to term, women who abort are 3.5 times more likely to die within a year. \n \n Such figures are always subject to statistical variation from year to year, country to country, study to study. For this reason, the researchers also reported what is known as \"95 percent confidence intervals.\" This means that the available data indicates that 95 percent of all similar studies would report a finding within a specified range around the actual reported figure. \n \n For example, the .50 odds ratio for childbirth has a confidence interval of .32 to .78. In other words, it is probable that 95 percent of the time, the odds ratio of death following childbirth will be found to be between 32 percent and 78 percent of the non-pregnant woman rate. The 95 percent confidence interval for the odds ratio of death following abortion was reported to be 1.27 to 2.42 of the annual rate for non-pregnant women",

   "Abortion is not as safe as we have been told \n Risky Business \n \n Over one hundred potential complications have been associated with abortion in medical literature. Some are short-term and others have long-term consequences. Thus, an abortion recorded as complication-free in a short term study, might, in fact, cause long-term damage. The longer women are kept under surveillance after an abortion, the higher are the reported rates of complications. Every type of abortion procedure carries risks that can be serious. The earlier the abortion is done, the lower is the rate of immediate and short-term \"major\" compli-cations. Late term abortions greatly increase the probability of harm. The younger the patient, the greater the long-term risks to her reproductive system. And all risks greatly increase when women experience repeat abortions. \n \n The nine most common major complications resulting from vacuum abortions are: infection, excessive bleeding, embolism, ripping or perforation of the uterus, anesthesia compli-cations, convulsions, hemorrhage, cervical injury and endotoxic shock. \n \n Minor complications include: minor infections, bleeding, fevers and chills, second degree chemical burns, chronic abdominal pain, vomiting, gastrointestinal disturbance, weight loss, painful or disrupted menstrual cycles and Rh sensitization. \n \n The risk of infection increases the chance of two long-term complications - infertility and ectopic pregnancies. Scar tissue left by the infection may block the fallopian tubes resulting in total or partial infertility and an increased probability of ectopic pregnancies. If a chronic infection results, a total hysterectomy may be required months or years after the abortion. \n \n Cervical damage may occur during the \"scraping out\" in a vacuum or D&C abortion or during the \"expulsion\" in a saline or prostaglandin abortion. But it is during the forced dilation of the uterus in vacuum and D&C abortions that most cervical damage is incurred. During forcible dilation, which occurs in all early surgical abortions, the cervix is hard and \"green.\" Thus, a tremendous stress is placed upon the woman's \"green\" cervical muscles which virtually always causes microscopic tearing of the muscles and occasionally results in severe ripping of the uterine wall - a major complication. The resulting weakening of the uterus may develop an \"incompetent cervix\" which, unable to carry the weight of a later wanted pregnancy, opens prematurely, miscarrying or prematurely birthing. \n \n Most data available on complications are based on information that is voluntarily reported by abortion clinics. But these clinics have an interest in minimizing or covering up their mistakes. No law requiring accurate reporting from clinics exists. Moreover, when compli-cations do occur, few women go back to the abortion clinic which caused the problem. Women turn to family doctors instead, thus never showing up as a complication in study results. \n \n Vital Statistics \n \n \"10,000 women are hospitalized for abortion complications each year.\" \n -\"Ulcer Drug Tied to Numerous Abortions in Brazil,\" New York Times, 5/19/93, p. C13. \n The rate of immediate and short-term abortion complications is 10% or more. This figure is based on a reported 100,000 abortion complications in 1977, when the total number of abortions was one million. The 10% rate is an undisputed minimum rate. It does not include unreported or long-range complications such as infertility. \n Two independent studies place the compli-cation rate for vacuum abortions at 12%. Considering both immediate and long-term complications, a major German study found the total complication rate for vacuum aspiration abortions exceeded 31%. \n Since the legalization of abortion in 1973, there has been a 300% increase in ectopic pregnancies in the United States. \n In a series of 1,182 abortions which occurred under closely regulated hospital conditions, researchers found that 27% of the patients acquired post-abortion infection resulting in fevers lasting three days or longer. The infection rate from outpatient \"abortion mills\" is probably much higher. A woman's body will overcome milder infections, but long-term damage may still result. Mild or severe infections may extend from the uterine lining to the fallopian tubes or to organs adjacent to the uterus. \n In one study of 74 women killed by legal abortions, anesthesia complications ranked as the third leading cause of death. The officially reported rate of anesthesia complications is one per 5,000 first trimester abortions. \n Women who undergo just one induced abortion are three to four times more likely to suffer from secondary infertility than non-aborted women. Numerous studies have found that three to five percent of all aborted women are inadvertently left sterile by the operation. \n Nearly 60% of all abortions are for first pregnancies. Though normally only five percent of all babies are born prematurely, this rate jumps to 40% among women who have had abortions. \n The risk of long-term complications following an abortion is ten to twenty times greater than the risk of any complications following childbirth. \n Above statistics documented in Aborted Women, Silent No More, \u00a9 David Reardon, 1987, pp. 93-113. \n \n Human Interest \n \n \"Physically, many (aborted women) have paid a high price for their abortions. Along with incomplete abortions, hemorrhage, and infections, some have suffered the loss of other internal organs, infertility, miscarriages, tubal pregnancies, premature births and stillbirths. Some have never had another child. Sadly, some never will, as they have lost their wombs to 'safe, legal abortion.'\" - Karen Crabtree, Heart to Heart Ministries, \"Testimonies of Regret, 20 Years of Legal Abortion,\" January 1993. Crabtree has gathered the testimonies of more than 500 women.",

Even on a healthy, mature woman's body. Not just painful and uncomfortable - but really hard. Your organs get squished and moved. My bladder was permanently damaged by my pregnancy. Labor - although painful - is something I suspect even men could get through. Delivery is another matter. You have do be BIG enough to deliver. Not many 13 year olds have a big enough pelvis for that. Or even a big enough body to sustain the girth of a baby. \n \n We are not talking a woman, or even teen here - we are talking about someone who is barely more than a little girl. She can't own property, get a job that would ever support a baby, she can't helath insurance, she has not even been through high school. No no no no",

In the 23-year period, the state had 870 death sentences, which resulted in only 36 executions because of appeals, reversals and delays. \n \n snip\n \n http://www.commondreams.org/headlines/061200-03.htm\n \n 68 Percent Error Rate Found in Death Case Study  \n Author calls serious problems 'epidemic' \n Marcia Coyle \n The National Law Journal \n \n snip\n \n When the 68 percent overall error rate is broken down into its state and federal components, the study, which covers the period from 1973 to 1995, reports: \n \n \u0095 Of 599 death sentences finally reviewed in their first federal habeas corpus petitions, federal courts overturned 40 percent, or 237, because of serious error. \n \n \u0095 Of the 4,578 death sentences finally reviewed by state high courts on direct appeal, 41 percent, or 1,885, were thrown out because of serious error. When that rate is combined with sentences overturned at the next stage -- state post-conviction proceedings -- state courts found serious error in 47 percent of death sentences. \n \n \u0095 Of 26 states that had at least one case move through the three stages of state and federal review, 24 had overall error rates of 52 percent or more. \n \n \u0095 Two errors trigger the majority of reversals at the state post-conviction stage: \"egregiously\" incompetent defense lawyers who overlook evidence of actual innocence or evidence supporting a lesser sentence, and prosecutorial or police suppression of such evidence. \n \n snip\n \n http://www.truthinjustice.org/68percent.htm\n \n Eye opening isn't it? Err on the side of what now?\n\n \n I very seriously doubt those statistics........A couple of liberal web sites will not change that...That is why I usually refrain using Drudge or Newsmax as a ref..........",

   "Just to be nit-picky, it might be something to point out that logic is merely the formal rules by which you reason, and things only logically follow from the values that you've inputted. . \n \n In logic there's a difference between a valid argument and a sound argument. A valid argument merely satisfies the formal requirement that the conclusion follows mechanically from the premises (x + x = 2x is a valid argument, for example). A sound argument satisfies the formal requirement and the premises are true.\n \n So while a conclusion may follow logically from a set of premises, those premises themselves may be false. It's important to differentiate between the logic you're using and the argument you are using that logic to prove. \n \n You can only use logic to prove something when the premises you are working from are either proved to be true, or assumed to be true for the sake of argument.\n \n Now, to say that something is logical or necessary, you're implicitly saying that something is logical or necessary given a particular set of premises. \n \n It may be logical to abort children when it follows from our basic values. If we presume our values are good and true, and aborting children follows as an implication of those values, then either aborting children is good and true, or our basic values are not good and true. \n \n Basic values, however, cannot be proved or disproved, only assumed as primitive.

   "I am not trying to belittle you, far from it.......I am not calling you sad.......I think its sad that millions of babies have to die....I commend you for carrying your baby to term but you avoided my question........How about the baby? Doesn't he or she have any rights? Why does he or she have to pay for the mistakes of their mother? The legal right you talked about is a law made by liberals who do not care about human life...... It is a horrible law that hopefully sometime in the near future will be overturned.....I think the law of God takes precedence.........\n \n God bless you for having your baby and raising it the way all mothers should.........\n\n \n Well the rights of a living woman should always come before that of a fetus. The unborn should never have rights above and beyond the woman carrying it. Being that it is part of her body, it should be her choice. You can cry about the thousands of unborn babies, but i can guaruntee you not everyone does. I am concerned with the living, and considering this girl has no family and no one to turn to, considering that her young age and god knows WHO the father is and if he forced her into sex or took advantage of her, i think it is well within her limits to decided if she wants to end this pregnancy or carry it to term (either for herself or adoption).\n \n And i think most of of are pretty tired of hearing the adoption angle, sure babies are always in demand. Young healthy white ones that is. Just because some family wants a baby, doesn't mean you should force a woman to carry to term a child she doesn't want, only to have her give it away. What right do YOU have to tell a woman to go through a pregnancy, which is difficult if not sometimes dangerous, especially teen mothers? If someone wants a child, there are THOUSANDS of children sitting in foster homes RIGHT NOW. We should never force woman to carry pregnancy to terms just because someone else might want it, get real.\n \n Pregnancy should never be a punishment, nor should we force people to go through it just because we disagree with their choices. Some people do everything right and get pregnant, some people do everything wrong. ABortion is a personal decision, and a hard one. I don't think it is ANY of your busines why a woman might choose it, she may not be able to care for one, she may not want one, or she may have health issues. Her personal reasons and personal medical reasons for obtaining an abortion should never have to be proved to YOU or any poltician or lawmaker.\n \n And no, i do not believe an unborn baby has 'rights' like you and me. Thus are disagreement. Until birth, you can't argue about rights because once you give it to a fetus, you take it away from the living mother.",

A sweatshop is far more productive and less damaging in the long run to the girl. it's not a great choice, but one weighs the pros and cons, it is clearly the better.

I kinda think that if abortion were to become illegal (for the most part) then you would see less kids having sex and less kids getting pregnant. When a 10yr old girl sees her 16yr old girl get pregnant on accident then maybe she will think twice about having sex at 13. Granted this is not a great reason to end abortion as it doesn't really address the 16 yr old but I think it might be true. I still say you need to help out that 16 yr old girl as much as possible. However, with abortion being legal she will most likely not receive any help as it is hard to get people to stop degrading women when people are degrading babies. Nevertheless, I think the 13yr old girl go the abortion not too sure though.\n\n \n It won't increase responsible action until we take a mature stand on sex. We are so stupidly puritanical about it. Information and resources make the biggest diffference in ALL matters.",

This can be taken to say that for any rule, whatever it may be, there is an exception to it. \n \n Saying that there is an exception to every rule however is formally congruent to saying there is a goose for every group of chickens. If we gather a group of chickens such that we discover that we have also gathered a goose, it is more accurate to say that we have made an error in how we gather chickens than make a weak inductive claim that all groups of chickens include a goose. \n \n A rule either covers all of the objects to which it pertains, or fails to be a well-applied rule. Any 'exception' to a rule is outside of the scope of such a rule. 'Exceptions' merely show that you are applying a rule incorrectly. When you are applying a rule correctly, there are no exceptions.",

She is obviously old enough to get pregnant and make the choice to have a baby, so i don't see why she is not old enough to make the decision not to. You are obviously a male, right? Because you see no problem with arbitrarily deciding that she is not capable of making that decision. Then who is, YOU? Give me a break. This is something that will affect the rest of this young girls life, how COULD someone else make that decision for her? \n \n Turn it around, say the state (as it appears they would be the only logical guardian) decides she is not capable of caring for a child, thus forcing her to abort. Do they have the right to force her to have an abortion against her will because they sat around and decided that she had no say? Hmmm?\n \n THIS IS ONLY SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS HER THE REST OF HER LIFE. I cannot fathom why anyone would attempt to take her opinion out of it. Yes, i think she is too young to go through the process ALONE, but not to ultimately make her OWN decision. \n \n \n \n, having a baby will help that out and her getting an abortion will let her know that having unprotected sex at 13 is ok because you can always abort. I hope that clears things up\n\n \n You have proof for this? Is this the same LAME argument that making condoms available causes people to have sex? Why don't you join reality. Abortion is not easy, and is not cheap. Legalized abortion doesn't mean more people are going to run out and have tons more sex. Because before the 70s, teenagers and unmarried couples never got pregnant EVER. Id love to see the study that would back up that claim. Its like the argument that capital punishment stops murder, because no one ever murders anyone in texas anymore!\n \n As far as consequences go, getting pregnant seems like a big enough one to me.

I don't see the revelance here. So what? Some woman are willing to give up their babies for adoption, some aren't. That has been the norm for a very long time. I don't have a problem with adoption, it is a wonderful thing. I have a problem with forcing woman to give birth and give their children up for adoption. If you don't think it happened, watch the Magdalene sisters. Or read about them.\n \n \nDid you know that the plantiff in Roe V Wade was coerced into filing the lawsuit by a group of feminists and has been quoted as saying it was the worse decision of her life and she will regret it always?\n\n \n I do know that the woman known as Roe now works for pro-life organizations. I however see no proof of coercion. And frankly, i don't care what she believes now. Roe V Wade is not about her, but about the woman across the country, as concerned with their right to privacy in making medical decisions.\n \n \nIt boggles my mind how you pro abortion types can shrug off 40,000,000 murders in the womb since 1972........It begs to ask the question, How can you sleep at night?\n\n \n I have a feeling it is because those 'types' don't view it as murder. It is called difference of opinion, of which people are entitled to have. I can't answer for them, i can only answer for myself. As a woman, being pro-choice is not about whether or not i agree with abortion, or what the total number of abortions is. it is about the fact that reproductive rights protect human dignity and autonomy at a basic level. Creating laws that affect your body is a form of ownership, forcing you to carry a pregnancy to term, or forcing you to abort are both forms of coercion, both taking ownership of your body away from you.\n \n It is about who has the right to your destiny and your body, you? Men? Politicians? The government? And that is the cornerstone of the movement itself, does the woman have control over her body, or does the government. Since 1965's Griswold v. Connecticut, the Supreme Court has recognized a \"right of privacy\", it invalidated a Connecticut law prohibiting the use of contraception by married couples. Roe v. Wade established that laws against abortion violate a constitutional right to privacy. And that is what the pro-choice movement is about, the privacy to make reproductive decisions, in effect, to be in control of your reproductive choices. \n \n My body and my health would always come over that of any developing fetus. When you give a fetus rights, you supercede those of the woman. When politicians pass fetal rights laws, they are almost always used to prosecute and undermine the legal status of pregnant women, not to protect pregnant woman and their fetus. Some people believe that the right to life begins at conception, others when it is a viable being, at birth, or not till later. That is all based upon opinion, which is why i do not agree with bestowing rights upon a fetus, zygote, etc till it is born. And i think birth is something we can can agree on.",

Or read about them.\n \n \n \n I do know that the woman known as Roe now works for pro-life organizations. I however see no proof of coercion. And frankly, i don't care what she believes now. Roe V Wade is not about her, but about the woman across the country, as concerned with their right to privacy in making medical decisions.\n \n \n \n I have a feeling it is because those 'types' don't view it as murder. It is called difference of opinion, of which people are entitled to have. I can't answer for them, i can only answer for myself. As a woman, being pro-choice is not about whether or not i agree with abortion, or what the total number of abortions is. it is about the fact that reproductive rights protect human dignity and autonomy at a basic level. Creating laws that affect your body is a form of ownership, forcing you to carry a pregnancy to term, or forcing you to abort are both forms of coercion, both taking ownership of your body away from you.\n \n It is about who has the right to your destiny and your body, you? Men? Politicians? The government? And that is the cornerstone of the movement itself, does the woman have control over her body, or does the government. Since 1965's Griswold v. Connecticut, the Supreme Court has recognized a \"right of privacy\", it invalidated a Connecticut law prohibiting the use of contraception by married couples. Roe v. Wade established that laws against abortion violate a constitutional right to privacy. And that is what the pro-choice movement is about, the privacy to make reproductive decisions, in effect, to be in control of your reproductive choices. \n \n My body and my health would always come over that of any developing fetus. When you give a fetus rights, you supercede those of the woman. When politicians pass fetal rights laws, they are almost always used to prosecute and undermine the legal status of pregnant women, not to protect pregnant woman and their fetus. Some people believe that the right to life begins at conception, others when it is a viable being, at birth, or not till later. That is all based upon opinion, which is why i do not agree with bestowing rights upon a fetus, zygote, etc till it is born. And i think birth is something we can can agree on.\n\n \n Well that was a mouthful.......So you believe if a pregnant woman changes her mind in the 3rd trimester she should be able to abort?",

   "Well that was a mouthful.......So you believe if a pregnant woman changes her mind in the 3rd trimester she should be able to abort?\n\n \n I shouldn't sidetrack myself here, but i am pro-choice. I support the privacy rights of woman. Do *I* personally support third trimester abortions? No, not unless there was a compelling medical reason.\n \n But here is the problem, the current law against late term abortions is unconstitutional because it does not allow for an exception for the womans health. that is unfathomable, and quite frankly shows that the creators and supporters of said legislation do not have the best interests of the woman at heart. In fact, it shows they could care less.\n \n Honestly, I have a problem with this types of law, because where does the burden of proof lie? WHO gets to decide when an abortion would be medically necessary? Do you get to go to another doctor for a second opinion if the first denies you? I am just left wondering how you would legislate this fairly, which doesn't even address the issue of privacy - would the woman have to petition the courts and open up her private medical record? To me ultimately this is a privacy issue, thus i do support abortion rights throughout the pregnacy, given that fetal viability is subjective.\n \n \n \nheard her interviewed and she said she was young and impressionable and that the feminist groups took advantage of her and she has regretted the decision her whole life\n\n \n Well, i can tell you she wouldn't be the first to regret her past. And i wouldn't be surprised if she felt as if she were a pawn in the whole issue..but yet i don't see what that has to do with the issue. Roe V Wade is probably the most important piece of legislation concerning the rights of woman, along there with the right to vote. I hardly feel it relevent if in hindsight, she regrets her actions. Because it was about all woman, not just her. \n \n \nI realize some abortions are necessary........I just want the unnecessary ones eliminated\n\n \n That is all fine and well, and i agree, but i am left wondering WHO is going to decide when one is warrented and when one isn't. I could tell you personally what situations i think abortion is warrented, but that would be my own opinion. And i don't think i can legislate that on woman i do not know. As a woman, i can tell you were i pregnant i don't think that it would concern YOU or anyone else for that matter. \n \n You may lose sleep over the potential lives lost to abortion, but i lose sleep over how anyone could think they could control my life and my destiny like that. I tend to think my rights are more important than anything growing inside me. And i don't feel the need to prove to anyone why i might need an abortion, given that it is my life. Just because people are willing to adopt is not a valid reason.\n \n I don't beleive the majority of the pro-life movement really cares about these children, because they are the first in line to force a young poor girl to abort (while they or their rich friends could easily get an abortion were it illegal elsewhere), and then first in line to deny her a living wage, healthcare, affordable housing, etc. I can't expect you to understand what it is like to be the mother of several children, only to get pregnant again with no means to support the next child. You haven't been in that position thus have no right to judge.\n \n This is a complicated issue, and saying well i think some abortions are warrented, and that people should be forced to carry pregnancies to term because somewhere out there someone is willing to adopt, isn't really realistic.\n This is about fairness and privacy under law. And who would overturning roe V wade hurt the most? I can give you a hint, not the politicians familes who would suggest such a thing.",

Instead of debating, the pro-life side tends to resort to emotional appeals, like....\n \n \"but would YOU support ripping out 8 month old fetuses and throwing them in the garbage?\"\n \n NO, and i doubt anyone would support such an extreme position, BUT it is an excellent way to deride the conversation. Of course i am not one of THOSE PEOPLE. Suddenly they have shifted the debate in their favor.\n \n My problem with most pro-lifers is they tend to live in a dream world. Where only neccessary abortions will occur, people obviously won't use their connections to get illegal abortions and no woman will endanger herself to self induce.
