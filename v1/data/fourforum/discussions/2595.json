   "Cutting edge fertility practices have taken an unexpectedly Frankensteinian turn, in my view. Let me briefly encapsulate the state of the art practice as I understand it and then offer my opinion on where the system becomes freakish. I will use as a case in point the septuplets born to Kennie and Bobbi McCaughey of Iowa approximately seven years ago.\n \n In vitro fertilization was first developed in Britain by harvesting oocytes (eggs) from the female after intensive use of hormones and fertility drugs which lasts several weeks. The oocytes are placed in a culture which replicates the environment of fallopian tubes and is mixed with the partner's sperm. After the oocytes divide once or twice (now called pre-embryos) they are transfered to the woman to aid in growth. The idea is to tranplant multiple pre-embryos to provide a better chance of cultivating a viable embryo, and then discarding the less-suitable candidates. Here's where it falls apart in some couples, as with the McCaughey's. Suddenly, Bobbi MaCaughey saw the hand of God in all of it and refused to allow the critical culling operation.\n \n Four months later she is in intensive care in the hospital, flat on her back for the duration, her vagina sewn shut to prevent hemmorhaging, doctors and nurses providing heroic, around-the-clock attention. Finally, when doctors deem it practical, she delivers seven miracles from God--septuplets--who are premature and require extensive and expensive medical treatment for months to come. \n \n The media treat the McCaugheys as darlings, and follow them around as though they are some great human interest story. Each anniversary brings a fresh round of feel-good articles. It is hardly reported that the people of McCaughey's small town are constantly called upon to help with the mundane chores of raising the kids, seeing that the couple can hardly be expected to do it alone. It is not reported that some of the children are developmentally disabled, and have been diagnosed with cerebral palsy, requiring life-long medical treatment and specialized equipment. \n \n In my opinion, infertile couples should be asked up front whether they will allow the critical step of culling pre-embryos to avoid the science-run-amuck aspect of in vitro fertilization. It should be made clear that the medical community and society are not at their disposal simply because of some childishly-held belief on their part. If their answer is no, they should be denied access to the technology which makes pregnancy possible and go back to the original method--praying for the \"miracle\".",
