   "One thing the Maurice Clarett contraversy has done is revive for me at least the debate over the value and purpose of athletic scholarships. To me at least a scholarship of any kind is an opportunity for a college education but college football and basketball programs have altered this into an opportunity for the advancement of the athletic program and quite frankly for many so called \"student athletes\" it has become a stepping stone to professional sports. It becomes clear to me that guys like Clarett and Mike Williams of USC and basketball stars like Carmelo Anthony did not want to go to college but believed they had to to get their shot at a pro career. So they used the athletic scholarship opportunity as a way to get into the NFL or NBA. This of course invites all kinds of recruiting violations that we often hear about that get college programs banned from postseason play or even worse get a program eliminated at least temporarily (SMU's football program comes to mind). Notice also that college baseball doesn't suffer from this problem because High school stars with a desire to turn pro have the practicle option of skipping college as a result of the MLB farm system which develops talent until it is ready for the big show. Perhaps that is what the NFL and NBA really need but that takes money and up until now they essentially had college programs as a farm system free of charge. Who would want to give that up? Anyway I just thought I would introduce this topic for discussion.",
