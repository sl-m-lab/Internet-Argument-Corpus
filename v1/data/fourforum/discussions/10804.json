   "I received this in an e-mail and it asked me to pass it along. Since I hate chain mails I thought I would share it here. Enjoy... emoticon_xclown \n \n Montana State Trooper\n In most of the United States there is a policy of checking on any stalled vehicle on the highway when temperatures drop to single digits or below. About 3 AM one very cold morning, Montana State Trooper Allan Nixon #658 responded to a call that there was a car off the shoulder of the road outside Great Falls, Montana. He located the car, stuck in deep snow and with the engine still running. Pulling in behind the car with his emergency lights on, the trooper walked to the driver's door to find an older man passed out behind the wheel with a nearly empty vodka bottle on the seat beside him. The driver came awake when the trooper tapped on the window. Seeing the rotating lights in his rearview mirror, and the state trooper standing next to his car, the man panicked. He jerked the gearshift into 'drive' and hit the gas.\n \n The car's speedometer was showing 20-30-40 and then 50 MPH, but it was still stuck in the snow, wheels spinning. Trooper Nixon, having a sense of humor, began running in place next to the speeding (but stationary) car. The driver was totally freaked, thinking the trooper was actually keeping up with him. This goes on for about 30 seconds, then the trooper yelled, \"PULL OVER!\"\n \n The man nodded, turned his wheel and stopped the engine. Needless to say, the man from North Dakota was arrested and is probably still shaking his head over the state trooper in Montana who could run 50 miles per hour. ",

Health nuts are going to feel stupid someday,\n lying in the hospital dying of nothing.\n \n #4. All of us could take a lesson from the weather.\n It pays no attention to criticism.\n \n #3. Why does a slight tax increase cost you two hundred dollars,\n and a substantial tax cut saves you thirty cents???\n \n #2. In the 60's, people took LSD to make the world weird.\n Now the world is weird and people take Prozac to make it normal.\n \n AND THE #1 THOUGHT FOR 2007:\n We know exactly where one cow with mad-cow-disease is located among the millions and millions of cows in the US , but we haven't a clue as to where thousands of illegal immigrants and terrorists are located.

   "This one's too good to be true, and yet it is. emoticon_smile\n \n NJ cops kick in door over bird's cries for help\n \n Fri Sep 5, 7:58 pm ET\n TRENTON, N.J. - Cries for help inside a Trenton, N.J., home turned out to be for the birds. Neighbors called police Wednesday morning after hearing a woman's persistent cry of \"Help me! Help me!\" coming from a house. Officers arrived and when no one answered the door, they kicked it in to make a rescue.\n But instead of a damsel in distress, officers found a caged cockatoo with a convincing call.\n It wasn't the first time the 10-year-old bird named Luna said something that brought authorities to the home of owner Evelyn DeLeon.\n About seven years ago, the bird cried like a baby for hours, leading to reports of a possible abandoned baby and a visit to the home by state child welfare workers. But it was only Luna practicing a newfound sound, DeLeon says.\n DeLeon says her bird learns much of her ever-growing vocabulary from watching television, in both English and Spanish.\n ___\n Information from: The Times, http://www.nj.com/times",

   "This wasn\\'t so cute as it was touching. It\\'s been floating around the internet for a while, but i felt it was a nice thought, so worth passing along. emoticon_xangel\n \n I WISH YOU ENOUGH...Recently I overheard a mother and daughter in their last moments together at the airport. They had announced the departure. \n \n Standing near the security gate, they hugged and the mother said, \\'I love you and I wish you enough\\'. The daughter replied, \\'Mom, our life together has been more than enough. Your love is all I ever needed. I wish you enough, too, Mom\\'.\n \n They kissed and the daughter left. The mother walked over to the window where I was seated. Standing there I could see she wanted and needed to cry. I tried not to intrude on her privacy but she welcomed me in by asking, \\'Did you ever say good-bye to someone knowing it would be forever?\\'. \n \n Yes, I have,\\' I replied. \\'Forgive me for asking, but why is this a forever good-bye?\\'. \\'I am old and she lives so far away. I have challenges ahead and the reality is - the next trip back will be for my funeral,\\' she said.\n \n \\'When you were saying good-bye, I heard you say, \\'I wish you enough\\'. May I ask what that means?\\' She began to smile. \\'That\\'s a wish that has been handed down from other generations. My parents used to say it to everyone\\'. She paused a moment and looked up as if trying to remember it in detail and she smiled even more. \\'When we said, \\'I wish you enough\\', we were wanting the other person to have a life filled with just enough good things to sustain them\\'.\n \n Then turning toward me, she shared the following as if she were reciting it from memory. \n \n I wish you enough sun to keep your attitude bright no matter how gray the day may appear.\n \n I wish you enough rain to appreciate the sun even more. \n \n I wish you enough happiness to keep your spirit alive and everlasting. \n \n I wish you enough pain so that even the smallest of joys in life may appear bigger. \n \n I wish you enough gain to satisfy your wanting. \n \n I wish you enough loss to appreciate all that you possess. \n \n I wish you enough hellos to get you through the final good-bye.\n \n She then began to cry and walked away. They say it takes a minute to find a special person, an hour to appreciate them, a day to love them but then an entire life to forget them.",
