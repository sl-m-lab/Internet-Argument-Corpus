   "Starting to see some imports coming into the U.S. \"Made in Vietnam.\" Also, Vietnam has oil and lots of it as I understand it. \n =========================\n \n Vietnam PM announces plans for historic US trip\n \n Canberra, May 5 (AP): Vietnam's Prime Minister today announced plans to visit the United States next month, which would make him the first Vietnamese leader to travel to the United States since the end of the war between the two countries 30 years ago.\n \n Prime Minister, Phan Van Khai, said arrangements were being made for him to visit Washington in June to strengthen cooperation with the United States. It was not immediately clear who he would meet in Washington.\n \n \"Thirty years have passed since the end of the war, this is the first ever visit by a leader of a unified Vietnam to the United States,\" Khai told reporters on the first day of a visit to Australia.\n \n Communist Vietnam recently marked the 30th anniversary of the war's end with a colorful parade of floats - some emblazoned with American business logos - down the same boulevard where North Vietnamese tanks rolled to victory against a US-backed government. \n \n (Snip)\n \n http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/001200505051255.htm",

   "That's good anyway.\n \n Vietnam has oil?\n\n \n And natural gas. Look for LNG to become bigger and bigger on the energy scene. They are sinking a lot of wells here in Texas but an acquaintance formerly with Halliburton told me that they are mainly gas wells. They can also liquify these reserves and ship via tanker to the U.S.\n ======================\n \n Vietnam Finds Oil in the Basement\n Northern Vietnam Offshore Discovery Sparks Potential Territorial Dispute\n \n PetroVietnam announced the first discovery of oil offshore northern Vietnam in October 2004.\n \n The find came in the area of Blocks 102 and 106 of Yen Tu field, about 70 kilometers east of Hai Phong, with an initial reserves estimate of 700-800 million barrels.\n \n Venture partners include the company's Petroleum Investment and Development Co., Malaysia's Petronas and the Singapore Petroleum Co.\n \n China quickly announced it was concerned and displeased by Vietnam's exploration in the area.\n \n Territorial rights in nearby parts of the South China Sea have been claimed by six countries -- China, Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan.\n Prospects in Vietnam\n \n \n Vietnam rarely makes headlines for petroleum development.\n \n But consider:\n \n Vietnam ranks third in oil production among Association of South East Asian Nations countries, trailing only Indonesia and Malaysia.\n \n If its current rate of development continues, Vietnam will become the world's 30th largest oil-producing nation.\n \n And perhaps the most startling aspect about Vietnam -- most of its production comes from offshore basement reservoirs.\n Attractive Reserves\n \n To date, Vietnam has produced almost a billion barrels of crude oil and 300 billion cubic feet of natural gas, according to Viet Anh Nguyen, new ventures coordinator for national oil company PetroVietnam.\n \n Nguyen estimated 2004 total output at 130 million barrels of oil and 200 Bcf of gas.\n \n The country's estimated resources, both onshore and offshore, now stand at 6.5-8.5 billion barrels of oil and 75-100 trillion cubic feet of gas, he said.\n \n Current oil and gas production comes from fields in the Cuu Long, Nam Con Son and Malay-Tho Chu basins, with gas also produced in the Song Hong Basin...\n \n (Snip)\n \n http://www.aapg.org/explorer/2005/02feb/vietnam.cfm",
