The theory and practice of socialism can be construed as a broad and comprehensive outlook on the human condition.\n \n In America, the meaning is more confused.

   "Locke was more of a libertarian, not liberal. And a very religious one at that. Governmental liberalism and libertarianism are incompatible concepts, IMO.\nFrom an article in the sixth edition of Columbia Encyclopedia:\n \n http://www.bartleby.com/65/lo/Locke-Jo.html\n \n \nLocke is most renowned for his political theory. Contradicting Thomas Hobbes, Locke believed that the original state of nature was happy and characterized by reason and tolerance. In that state all people were equal and independent, and none had a right to harm another's \"life, health, liberty, or possessions.\" The state was formed by social contract because in the state of nature each was his own judge, and there was no protection against those who lived outside the law of nature. The state should be guided by natural law.\n \n Rights of property are very important, because each person has a right to the product of his or her labor. Locke forecast the labor theory of value. The policy of governmental checks and balances, as delineated in the Constitution of the United States, was set down by Locke, as was the doctrine that revolution in some circumstances is not only a right but an obligation. At Shaftesbury's behest, he contributed to the Fundamental Constitutions for the Carolinas; the colony's proprietors, however, never implemented the document.\n \n Locke based his ethical theories upon belief in the natural goodness of humanity. The inevitable pursuit of happiness and pleasure, when conducted rationally, leads to cooperation, and in the long run private happiness and the general welfare coincide. . . .\n \n",
