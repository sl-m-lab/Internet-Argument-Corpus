   "Prosecutor fired over ties to racist group\n \n \nAllegany County assistant DA loses job after participation in conference of \"white preservationists' raises concern about ability to serve effectively\n \n News Staff and Wire Reports\n 3/3/2006 \n \n A Southern Tier prosecutor was fired Thursday for participating in a recent conference of \"white preservationists\" in northern Virginia. \n Michael Regan, a Wellsville-based lawyer who worked as a part-time district attorney in Allegany County, was terminated after his boss, District Attorney Terrence Parker, looked into numerous e-mails he said he received expressing concern about Regan's presence last week at the conference of the New Century Foundation. \n \n \"It has become clear that his recent activities will continue to significantly disrupt and impair his effectiveness as an assistant district attorney and the operations of the entire district attorney's office,\" Parker said. \n \n Regan, 49, was reached late Thursday afternoon in his Wellsville office but declined to comment. He worked in the towns of Alfred, Amity, Bolivar, Cuba and Genesee and the villages of Alfred, Belmont, Bolivar and in Wellsville, where he handled DWI and domestic violence cases, according to the district attorney's Web site. \n \n Regan was quoted in a Sunday Washington Post article about the conference as saying demographics as well as U.S. policies on immigration and trade have put the country on the wrong path. He referred to participants as \"white preservationists\" and told the Post that \"European Christian Americans are an endangered species.\" \n \n The New Century Foundation, based in Oakton, Va., calls itself \"a nonprofit research organization.\" The Anti-Defamation League characterizes the foundation's ideology as \"intellectualized, pseudoscientific white supremacy\" that promotes \"genteel\" racism. \"[Regan's] comments are absolutely inappropriate for a public official,\" said Joel Levy, New York regional director of the ADL. \n \n In addition to Regan's part-time work as a prosecutor, he has held an adjunct professor post in the Alfred University College of Business since 2003, the college said. University President Dr. Charles Edmonson, in a statement, said Regan's future as a part-time instructor would be determined \"by our needs and his capabilities.\" \n \n Alfred doesn't hire or fire people because of their outside activities \"unless those activities suggest that they represent a menace to the safety and order of the university,\" the statement said. \"We have employees who are also members of diverse religious and social groups, political parties, school boards, various village and town boards, and county legislatures who sometimes take controversial public positions. Alfred respects the rights of free expression outside the classroom.\" \n\n \n I find it very interesting that if Mr. Regan attended an NAACP, ADL, NOW, NARAL, etc. conference, he would be lauded as a \"hero\".",

   "Legally speaking, no one should be fired for legal acts!  \n \n Just a side note here. There are womens groups for women. There are black groups for african-americans, there are gay and lesbian groups for homosexuals and so on. Isn't it ironic, how we won't allow men to have a group for men or we call them sexist, and we won't allow a caucasion/anglo-american group to exist without calling them racist. \n \n Personally, I don't like \"groups\" per se. I think groups like NOW, and NAACP do more harm than good. It's kind of like \"volunteer segregation\". Weird. If a \"white\" man set up the organization like NOW or NAACP, they'd be protesting in the street, but when they do it to themselves, it called empowering?????? Got me, like I said, groups like those are more dividing than uniting.\n \n Let's be real here, the \"bad white\" folks like Thomas Jefferson and George Washington who owned slaves, denied women the right to vote, they are not around anymore (In America at least). Sure we have a new breed of white folks and its not those white folks sitting around in Alabama that scare me. I'm more afraid of the \"white\" group that was in Davos in January. They control wages and benefits, they control product and their cost, they control who gets what products and where. Simply they control your standard of living.\n \n http://www.weforum.org/site/homepublic.nsf/Content/Davos+Leaders+%22Optimistic+on+Economic+Growth%E2%80%9D+%E2%80%93+%E2%80%9CPessimistic+on+Security%E2%80%9D\n \n Look at the very bottom of that web page where it says \"priorities for leaders\"\n \n Now that is scary.",

Whenever NOW, NARAL, etc. rear their ugly heads, the lame-stream media always lauds them as \"great crusaders\" of this, that, or the other thing.
