So I'll tell you what TQ, if you really want to go forward and prove I am such a liar, post the specific alleged lies I have told and I will, by using your own examples show how you have abused, misinterpreted, corrupted and outright lied about my responses as you twisted what i have said in so many, if not all debates we have had. So I'll adopt your battle cry TQ, PUT UP OR SHUT UP!!!\n =================================================================================================\n \n \n Just to make things interesting TQ, and only because this just jumped out at me, I see no reason not to point out one excellent example of your corrupt and disingenuous tactics.\n \n Here on the cave painting thread, after I had magnanimously conceded to Kronus about the 1656 years between Adam and Noah, shown here: http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=302241&postcount=57 you, being the ungracious and sanctimonious thug that you are, made this post accusing me of changing the goal posts now and reverting to the estimated 6000 year creation date when my argument of the time span between Adam and Noah was accepted as accurate.

So I'll adopt your battle cry TQ, PUT UP OR SHUT UP!!!\n\n \n Oh, Archie, you just put a big smile on my face. You want me to show where you've lied? OK, here's just one of your recent hits:\n \n 1) Pandion catches you quote mining your siggy here\n \n 2) You respond by saying it's not a quote mine here\n \n 3) You pull your usual tactic when your caught in a lie here. You see it as an unfair attack and try to make the one who caught you lying look like the bad guy. You for some reason don't see that when you post something inaccurate/false in support of your argument, you are the one responsible for fact checking it. As I stated here, the fact that you post so many fraudulent links means one of three things:\n a) you didn't know any better, i.e. your knowledge of the subject your attempting to debate is too little to recognize falsehood, or \n b) you didn't bother to research the claims made in the link you posted as support for your position. i.e) you're lazy/incompetent, and just post things that you believe support you without actually verifying the information, or\n c) you recognized the falsehoods and posted the link anyway, making you a liar and fraud as well.\n \n As a sidenote, the fact that you constantly state that you abandon threads because we twist what you sayis especially hypocritical due to your reliance on quote mines. I've posted one of my responses to you, along with your claim of my \"twisting\" what you said, despite quoting you verbatim. I'd also like the readers to know this was Archie's last response of any substance in that thread. He couldn't answer me, so he accused me of dishonesty, insulted me, and ran.\n \n 4)OK, back to the siggy. After declaring your innocence of quote mining, we flash forward to about 8-9 days later. In response to your insistence that it I twisted what you said to mean something completely different, I brought up when Pandion caught you quote mining your signature. You respond here.\n \n For those reading along, this is what Archie's siggy was:\n \"can the liberties of a nation be secure when we have removed a conviction that these liberties are the gift of God?\"\n This is what he claims it always was:\n \"can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are the gift of God?\"\n \n 5) When confronted about this by myself, O_C and Electrolyte, you responded as such, using your usual tactic of claiming innocence while blaming those who've caught you out.\n \n 6) Electrolyte found a google cache page showing that you had changed your siggy. Giant Oreo copied and pasted it here\n \n To sum up:\n 1) you had a quote mine as your signature\n 2) you were called on it. You stated it wasn't a quote mine, as you copied it from a web site (it doesn't matter if you mined it or found it already mined, it's a quote mine)\n 3) You ranted about being attacked because you were again caught being dishonest\n 4) You state that I misrepresented what you said, when I quoted you verbatim. Continual requests for clarification resulted in nothing from you. To clarify what twisting what someone is saying actually looks like, I referenced the quote mine signature that Pandion uncovered.\n 5) It was at this point that it was discovered that you had since changed your signature. You, however, tried to pretend that you hadn't changed your signature by copying your current (corrected) signature along with the source that Pandion had previously provided. You then claimed we were trying to \"demonize\" you by pointing out how you again were lying.\n 6)Electrolyte found a google cache page, which Giant Oreo copied and pasted, proving that you had in fact changed your signature, despite your denials.\n \n There we go. That's one example of your dishonesty. I could also provide many more, as could OC, Electrolyte, Kronus, Pandion, and pretty much anyone else who's read your posts.",

I'm not questioning what the bible DOES SAY. I'm questioning WHAT IT DOESN'T SAY.

Here is your post. \n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=302469&postcount=73\n\n Yes, I did accuse you of moving the goal posts. As did Pandion. That's because you did. Kronus' argument was to the maximum amount of time that could have elapsed between creation and present day, using the genealogies in the bible. You, in your \"magnanimous withdrawal\" stated that you still didn't agree with him that 6K years had passed between creation and the present (you favor the 30K-50K year range). You demanded that Kronus prove the genealogies between Adam and Noah was unbroken as chronicled in the bible. This tells me you don't read the bible much. And that is the point he proved. Using common sense and logic, Kronus explained to you after you \"graciously\" admitted you were wrong that you're \"wanted date\" of 30K-50K was impossible, here\n \n \nNow here is my very first post in that thread regarding the subject of the date of the World. And as you can see, it was based on the over all Creation age, not just the time span between Adam and Noah.\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=301804&postcount=6\n \n So why would you accuse me of changing the goal posts when i was simply restating the very original concern i had from my earliest post on this subject?
