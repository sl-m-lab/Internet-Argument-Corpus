   "What is your definition of a perfect system of government for an imperfect world?\n \n My own personal views are as follows:\n \n Monarchy: fastest decision-making capability, largest chance for quick success or failure, usually left up to stupid ways of selecting a ruler such as blood\n \n Republic/Democracy: majority approval (though sometimes indirect by electing people to make the decision for them) of the governed in most cases, compartmentalization will lower the impact of losing a single part of the government but usually leads to slower decisions or infighting\n \n Oligarchy: the weaknesses of the two previous forms of government are dulled, but at the same time the benefits are also dulled. This form has the best margin for error so while it may lead to a mediocre country, it is a stable country. I'd rather live in a stable country as my life is already enough of a roller-coaster so this is my favorite form of government.\n \n ...and to be completely honest I don't know if communism is more of a political or economical thing so I'd rather keep my mouth shut and have you question me stupid than to open it and reveal all doubt.\n \n Now it's your turn! Fire away.\n \n ps, please keep comments about economic models away from this discussion as that's not really what I'm going for.",

What is so frustrating though is that we have become a corrupted political system and the inmates, as they say are now running the asylum. We now have professional politicians who have become entrenched in Washington because we have a voting public which is either so disinterested or dumbed down that they continue to re-elect these same criminals at every new 2 year cycle. \n \n I wish we could create term limits for State Reps and Senators so new, fresh and untarnished representatives would be brought into washington every 4 years so they couldn't ever get bought and paid for by special interests which is the reality today. Our founders believed in limited service so new people could serve and then return to their districts as one of the people. Political Corruption will be the ultimate downfall of this country as our elected reps show more loyalty to their benefactors, they take their eyes off of the ball in protecting the Nation they were elected to serve and protect. That is the problem we are experiencing right now.",
