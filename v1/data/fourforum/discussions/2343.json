   "WHAT THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION ISN&#8217;T TELLING YOU\n \n \n In April 2003 the amended version of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 was put into place, seemingly to better protect patient health information and hold violator&#8217;s accountable, pursuant to 42 USC \u00a71320d-5, which affords both civil and criminal penalties. \n \n According to the American Medical Association web-page regarding HIPAA laws, &#8220;the Privacy Rules require physicians to use appropriate administrative, technical, and security safeguards to protect the privacy of protected health information &#8211; including oral communications&#8221;. And as such, under the criminal enforcement, &#8220;any person who knowingly obtains or discloses individually identifiable health information in violation of the Administrative Simplification Regulations faces a fine of up to $50,000, as well as imprisonment up to one year. Offenses committed under false pretenses allow penalties to be increased to a $100,000 fine, and up to five years in prison. Finally, offenses committed with the intent to sell, transfer or use individually identifiable health information for commercial advantage, personal gain or malicious harm permit fines of $250,000, and imprisonment for up to ten years&#8221;. Whereas the civil enforcement portion permits the government to impose &#8220;civil monetary penalties of $100 per violation, up to $25,000 per year&#8221; against violator&#8217;s. However, pursuant to 65 FR 82566 our Federal government officials in all their wisdom, decided to knowingly deprive a private cause of action against anyone who violates a patients&#8217; rights to privacy and their protected health information. What this statute means is that even if you have a clear cut violation of your rights with all the evidence to convict, you have no right to sue the person for any damages you sustain regardless of the type or degree of the damages. \n \n The American Medical Association goes on to say, &#8220;At least for now, the Office for Civil Rights (\"OCR,\" the agency responsible for enforcing the Privacy Rules) has indicated that enforcement will be complaint-based. Accordingly, OCR will respond to complaints that are filed but will not proactively investigate. If a patient has a complaint that a physician violated the patient's privacy rights, the patient may choose to complain to the physician, to OCR, or to both. If the patient complains to OCR, OCR or the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") will likely follow up with the physician to request an explanation and response. OCR/DOJ may ask the physician to implement a voluntary corrective action plan. It is unlikely that OCR or DOJ would make an on-site investigation unless the physician was uncooperative or the government determined that an on-site investigation was necessary&#8221;. What this means, is that healthcare providers and medical professionals really have nothing to worry about for even if they do violate the law. The probability that they will be held legally accountable is slim to none. So one must ask what is the motivation given here for anyone to actually obey the HIPAA law and not unlawfully share your protected health information with unauthorized persons? When, by all accounts of the AMA statement the amended version of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 is a pathetic joke at the tax payers expense. Since it is your tax dollars that are paying the bills for the so-called &#8220;governmental investigations&#8221; that are really nothing more than a whitewash patronizing effort that in reality only serves to actually cover up acts of wrongdoing and allow violator&#8217;s to go unpunished. \n \n Many times I listen to people tell why they support President Bush and claim that the liberals are wrong in their beliefs for one reason or another and yet, I am often curious whether or not Bush supporters are truly educated about the laws Bush has been signing into law. If they were and actually realized just how many legal rights Bush has taken away from the people, I wonder if they would be so proactive in claiming that Bush is the cure all to our Nation&#8217;s problems. And because the Department of Justice is under the command of Attorney General Ashcroft, who himself is very much apart of the Bush administration. It is clear that from every angle possible, the people are consistently having their rights taken away under the dictatorship of the Bush administration.",
