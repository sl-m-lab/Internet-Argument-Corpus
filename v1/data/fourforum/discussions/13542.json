   "9 of Joe Lieberman's constituents were arrested in his Connecticut offices today during a sit-in for single payer. \n \n YouTube - Joe Lieberman's Constituents Arrested in Senate Office Sit-In for Single-Payer\n \n The non-violent resisters were part of a group of 25 Connecticut citizens asking Lieberman to sign a pledge to no longer accept money from health insurance companies. \n \n Now that sounds like a pledge just about every United States senator's constituents should be asking them to sign. While sitting in on their offices.\n \n Health care is a human right. Medicare for ALL.\n \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plBmwPYIG9g&feature=related",

   "Everybody seems so confused about National Health Care, but I fail to see what is so confusing about it. It's at least as important and vital as Police and Fire Protection, Military Preparedness and the minimum Education we now provide.

It's easy to understand why the insurance and drug companies would want to avoid Health Care Reform at most any cost. What really needs to be addressed in order to move this Dream into Reality for the American Citizen and Corporate America is a face off with our elected officials. It's obvious our elected officials are far more interested in re-election coffers being tended to by the drug and insurance companies. If you have any doubt, just look back when Part D was dealt with for Medicare. By the time it was all over, we found it illegal to go out of the United States to buy drugs, even if they were cheaper, and it was illegal to negotiate the cost of drugs even though every country dose so. It really is immaterial weather the politician is democrat or republican, they are compromised with self ambition and have no regard for reality, honesty, integrity much less what is best for the people they represent. Anyone who really can't see the benefit of National Health Care for America is far more than one brick short of a load, and will be the ones that will need it the most.",

For example, preexisting conditions could easily be outlawed with a simple, immediately effective piece of legislation. And Medicaid expansion, while helpful to many, is principally a band aid, not the needed surgery for a profusely bleeding nation.\n \n Then, the clincher is that Democrats are making us wait until the next election before anything is enacted. Why in the world would this rationally be necessary? Do we really need this paper monster just to obtain a few minimal advances in care for those who don't have it. \n \n A general rule is to never negotiate with terrorists.
