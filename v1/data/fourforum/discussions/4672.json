   "The Canadian unemployment rate is roughly 7%, it probably is a economic structural factor due to higher payroll taxes and a higher minimum wage.\n \n Walmart is closing a store or two in Quebec due to the stores unionizing (not an official statement but people with half a brain can see through it)\n \n Overall I would agree with Waxy, Canada has had very little benifit from NAFTA from real economic standpoint. Most of the increases in trade that we have seen with the US would have occured with or without NAFTA. Energy, and raw materials would have been bought from Canada regardless. The autosector already had a long running agreement. Other manufacturing sectors Canada is going to suffer the same competitive issues that the US and Western Europe are.",

It started rearing it's ugly head in the late 70's with Japan and Korea challenging domestic auto makers and the heavy equipment industry.

   " Or that our products for export, would have been too high priced for the other countries to buy, because of the high wages our USA companies have to pay Americans to build them ?\n\n \n Exactly. High wages are one of the main factors behind the high cost of US made goods. When you combine that with the slump in quality of US made goods, they've caused the transition of the USA from an economic power to a debtor nation, whose manufacturing base has moved offshore. I'm no expert on this, for that, contact georged.\n \n \nI thought the USA was fairly independent from outside sources for our usage of utilites such as electric and water. How would a non-nafta, affect american utilities ? ( leaving ME oil out of the topic of course)\n\n \n I've seen the same numbers as Lord Tammerlain, approx. 25-30% of the USA's oil, electrical and water comes from Canada. Large portions of the US's electrical grid in the NE and California are sourced directly from Canada. A flip of the switch in BC or Quebec would leave millions, likely 10s of millions, without electricity. The distribution and price of this power is tightly controlled by NAFTA.\n \n Our natural gas is pipelined directly to Chicago, at prices guaranteed and controlled by NAFTA.\n \n Then there's softwood lumber, mining, agriculture, etc... \n \n I honestly can't think of a benefit to Canada that NAFTA has provided other than the move of some auto manufacturing facilities into Ontario. If anyone can provide me with some examples, I'd love to hear them.\n \n As for Mexico, just imagine how bad the problem would be if they didn't have that expanding economic base and they were still the largely third world country they were even 20 years ago.\n \n Waxy",
