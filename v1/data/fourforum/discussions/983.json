Him and Arafat were the best chance for peace. His own assasin words: \"I did this to stop the peace process,\" he said. \"We need to be coldhearted.\"\n \n Rabin's assasin? Most definately will burn in ****.\n \n Sharon? Most definatley will burn in ****.\n Looks like he will finally be held accountable for crimes against humanity.\n \n http://www.palestinemonitor.org/israelipoli/sharon_trial_campaign_gathers_mo.htm\n \n Ask yourself these questions? Who is evil in this game? The Nobel Peace Prize winner? Or the man on trial for crimes against humanity.",
