This is the same point I attempted to make on a thread I started but was attacked as a brainwashed christian hater of anyone different than me. Go figure huh ?\n\n I think that discussion about relations between races and ethnic groups are frought with oversensitivity. My guess is that you might have introduced fairly objective ideas that were then interpreted as racist because of those oversensitivities. \n \n Where Muslims in Europe are concerned, they are discriminated against in jobs, housing and in other areas of life and that, along with the thought of many Muslims of the non-Muslims in Europe as infidels, breads hate and violence. Though I am sure that prejudice against Muslims plays a role in some of their limited lots in life, they have to also examine their own culture to see what they could change in themselves to improve their lot. \n \n The question is how Western governments can go about solving this problem with their Muslim immigrants without supporting stereotypes or inflaming racial sensitivity.It is a tough question. Most Muslims place so much importance in the validity of their religion and in the validity of the text of the Koran that they often cannot think objectively about their religion and its influences so any discussion on the topic leads nowhere. Since their religion plays such a strong role in their political and social practices, it is difficult to criticize those practices without criticizing the religion. \n \n Where multiculturalism is concerned, I can understand the desire for governments to allow people to practice their religion as they wish. However, certain funudamentalist religions give their adherents so little freedom of thought, little or no access to other ideas, and subject one sex to such limitations that it is hard to justify such oppression and restriction happening on the grounds of free Western nations. I think people have the right to practice the religion which they choose but I find it important that people be exposed to a wide range of ideas so their religious choice is an informed one. Therefore, I think Western countries should have the right to dictate minimum standards in school to allow these children to be exposed to the wide range of ideas from which they can then choose. Where women are concerned, I think that the governments should supply safehouses to certain oppressed Muslim women (and women of other oppressive households) who seek refuge from their families or communities.\n \n There is also the question of freedom of speech. Should speech (by certain extremist Islamic religious leaders or other extremist groups) supporting and encouraging terrorist acts be allowed? Does freedom of speech have ANY bounds? These are some of the challenges that European societies will have to face.\n \n On a side note, I should mention that Muslim immigrants are not the only ones causing problems and, indeed, it is not only immigrants that cause problems. However, their numbers in Europe are growing so substantially that these specific problems cannot be ignored. Also, I should mention that there are many moderate Muslims who do see the problems and want to solve them but, as you have said, they are often intimidated by the more extreme elements among them.",

I knew you couldn't. :xbanghead\n\n There seemed to be two topics that came up in this thread - one being the capture of the Brits and the other being the issue of Muslim immigrants in Europe. My own comments were in reference to the topic of Muslim immigrants in Europe.\n \n Where the original topic is concerned, if the Brits were indeed on Iranian space, then officially the Iranians have the right to arrest those Brits. However, I think it must be fairly clear to all that the Brits did not intend to invade Iranian space - it was an accident. I remember reading a fairly recent story of German soldiers accidentally going into Swiss territory. The incident was laughed off in the press and all that happened was the German military suffered an embarrassment. Of course, the British-Iranian relationship is a bad one whereas the German-Swiss relationship was a good one. I can understand how the rhethoric of \"axis of evil\" and the hints of US/coallition military involvement in Iran would be enough to make the Iranians paranoid that the British ship (US allies) was purposely in Iranian waters. That type of thinking is the consequence of such poor relations.\n \n I have no doubt that there are unjust treatments of certain Iranians by the coallition forces. That was not the topic of this thread. Perhaps you could start a new thread on that topic or perhaps you could present a credible link to this story of Iranians being arrested who were invited by the Iraqi government. For example, was the misunderstanding cleared up, were there other issues involved. We cannot judge without hearing the details.",

And when the troubles started (like the killing of Theo van Gogh), she started to play innocent and use the threats against her as \"proof\" that Islam is teh evil.\n\n \n Then explain Salmon Rushdie. All he did was write one book that Islam disagreed with and the death warrent is still over his head more than 20 years later. And how do you explain the random sunni and sheite MOSLEM CIVILIAN men, women and children who are randomly killed by suicide bombs which are carried by fellow moslems because they don't agree with the radicals agenda, or are just random victims in the radicals attempts to continue the blood shed and start the civil war they seek in Iraq in order to stop this budding Democracy from taking hold ?\n \n \nAs a member of the Dutch parliament she was nothing short of utter ####.

And guess what, the Dutch people are still paying for her security detail. :xbanghead\n\n \n God forbid this woman of hate dares to speak her mind regarding the negative impact radical islam is having on every Country on Earth. How dare she speak her mind regarding these murderous war mongers who have zero respect for human life, be it Gentile, Jew or Arab. Oh, and I'm of Arab descent also you know.

In a situation of war, I am sure that there is paranoia and often unjustified suspicion - that is part of the risk of walking into a war zone. \n \n \"A spokesman for Iraqi President Jalal Talabani said Talabani had invited the Iranians to the country, and the president was \"unhappy\" about the arrests.\n \n The U.S. National Security Council confirmed that the American military arrested at least four Iranians in raids during the past week in Iraq, including two diplomats. \n \n NSC spokesman Gordon Johndroe said the two diplomats were questioned, turned over to the Iraqi government and released.\n \n At least two others, who are members of the Iranian military, remain in U.S. military custody while an investigation is conducted on whether they were involved in attacks on security forces in Iraq, Johndroe said.\"\n \n This means that there were actions taken to clear up this problem - which resulted in the two diplomats being freed. There is apparently still suspicion about the others - so an investigation is underway.\n \n What is it exactly that you considered unjust in this situation? Do you assume that they were arrested randomly and that the suspicions on which they were arrested were a complete fabrication? Do you think that nobody should be arrested on suspicion but on hard demonstratable facts? That would be a hard policy to support in times of war - especially with combatants that are not traditional (in uniforms of the enemy, etc.).",

   "Your view of history is warped and one sided my friend. Islam has always had a majority of peace loving members and a minority of radicals who led the masses like a horse with a bridle in its mouth. If the peaceful element speaks against the violence of the minority, they are killed outright and used as an example to the rest of the silent majority to remain quiet or also die a ruthless death. Islam rules by intimidation and control, it always has and always will. Don't you know that forcing people to repeat a memorized prayer 5 times a day is a perfect way to brainwash the masses and control their thoughts.

When the Word of God was withheld from the common man, darkness prevailed throughout the Western World. But today, it is the use and practices as promoted by Muhammad, the founder of Islam that seems to be the cause of the shroud of darkness that is currently enveloping the World today. \n \n \nSo you're saying that a group of people as a whole is responsible for the actions of the few?\n\n \n I said nothing of the sort.

Muhammad founded the religion by killing the men in small villages and capturing the women and children as forced converts then moving on to the next village. The women were made to become forced wives of future children warriors, which is why multiple wives are allowed in Islam, because they originally had too few men for the captured women.

They are also using weapons provided by the Russians, Americans, Chinese, British etc. Though most of the time the insurgents don't need any Iranian (or any other foreign) weapons because they have enough weapons of their own.

   "If it DOES turn out that the sailors were in Iranian waters, I find it ironic that some of the people here attacking Iran (like Archangel for instance) are the same people that are calling for \"self-defense\" (for example, in another thread AA said we should have decimated Osama Bin Laden's estate in Saudi Arabia to kill his parents, brothers and sisters, and nieces and nephews - claiming it would have been \"self-defense\"). \n \n I don't see how they CAN'T see the hypocrisy of their views - WE should \"defend\" ourselves, but in a case where another country's military enters the borders of a place like Iran and eventually are captured by Iranians (this is still assuming it turns out to be the case), boy that Iran better watch out.\n \n Complete and utter hypocrisy.\n\n \n The Brits had a military Chopper hovering right over them prior to being boarded, and that Chopper had GPS technology that confirmed that they were definately in Iraqi Waters. To the Brits there is no question that this was an aggressive move by Iran. And furthermore, if the Brits were in Iranian waters by a few hundred feet, what reason could Iran possibly have for arresting citizens of a Country they AREN'T EVEN AT WAR WITH ? Can the Iranian apologist explain that please ?\n \n And would you ever suspect Iran of making this aggressive move because these patrols were keeping them from moving weapons and IEDs into Iraq to aid the Terrorists in their anti democracy war ? That this was an attempt to open the waters to get their weaponry past ours and the Brits security. That would never occur to you would it.

Didn't see a mention of this magical military chopper that was hovering over them.\n\n \n Of what value is the latest story if you want to find out what happened on the day of the incident ? Wouldn't going back and seeing what was said contemporaniously be more efficient ? Here is the Authorized Press Conference the British Authorities gave when they explained the contradictions inherent in the Iranians story, and the direct GPS evidence they had, INCLUDING THE MENTION OF THEIR CHOPPER THAT FLEW OVER THE SCENE. So please don't call me a liar untill you research it first and prove me one. \n \n http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/MilitaryOperations/ModBriefingShowsRoyalNavyPersonnelWereInIraqiWaters.htm\n \n See Slide - chart of Northern Persian Gulf <<< \n \n \"On 23 March a boarding team consisting of seven Royal Marines and eight sailors - who were embarked in two of HMS CORNWALL's boats - conducted a routine boarding of an Indian flagged Merchant Vessel which was cooperative throughout. They investigated this vessel after witnessing her unloading cars into two barges secured alongside. Since early March the force has conducted 66 routine boardings. So the one that I'm talking about was entirely routine business, and conducted in a particular area where four other boardings have been completed recently. \n \n \"As shown on the chart, the merchant vessel was 7.5 nautical miles south east of the Al Faw Peninsula and clearly in Iraqi territorial waters. Her master has confirmed that his vessel was anchored within Iraqi waters at the time of the arrest. The position was 29 degrees 50.36 minutes North 048 degrees 43.08 minutes East. This places her 1.7 nautical miles inside Iraqi territorial waters. This fact has been confirmed by the Iraqi Foreign Ministry.\n \n \n Picture shows first Iranian reported position [1] and corrected Iranian position [2]\n [Picture: MOD] \n See Slide - Iranian claimed positions <<< \n \n \"The Iranian government has provided us with two different positions for the incident. The first we received on Saturday and the second on Monday. As this map shows, the first of these points still lies within Iraqi territorial waters. We pointed this out to them on Sunday in diplomatic contacts. \n \n \"After we did this, they then provided a second set of coordinates that places the incident in Iranian waters over two nautical miles from the position given by HMS CORNWALL and confirmed by the merchant vessel. The two Iranian positions are just under a nautical mile apart - 1800 yards or so. It is hard to understand a reason for this change of coordinates. We unambiguously contest both the positions provided by the Iranians.\n \n \"I should just explain at this point that the boats remained connected at this point. One of the seaboats was connected via data link, which communicated its position continually to the ship where it was displayed, superimposed on an electronic chart, on a purpose built console. During the boarding this console was constantly monitored and indicated, throughout, that the boats had remained well within Iraqi territorial waters.\n \n \"Our boarding started at 0739 local time and was completed at 0910 with the merchant vessel having been cleared to continue with her business. Communications were lost with the boarding team as the boarding was finishing ... at 0910. HMS CORNWALL's Lynx helicopter, which had been covering the initial stages of the boarding, immediately returned to the scene to locate the boarding team. \n \n \"The helicopter reported that the two seaboats were being escorted by Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Navy vessels towards the Shatt 'Al Arab Waterway and were now inside Iranian territorial waters. Debriefing of the helicopter crew and a conversation with the master of the merchant ship both indicate that the boarding team were ambushed while disembarking from the merchant vessel. Both boats were equipped with a GPS chart plotter.\n \n \n \n \n \nDid you ever consider that if an Iran military vessel entered U.S. waters they would be boarded, captured, and detained (probably permanently in Guantanamo - not for a month like these sailors)?\n\n \n The US has no diplomatic relations with Iran at this time so if we were in their waters it would be the same issue. But the Brits are not at war with Iran and do have an embassy in Terhan. So being treated like this should cause any reasonable person to question what is motivating them. That, of course explains why you don't get it. How's it feel to be an apologist for the bad guys in every issue ? While sucking up the life force and enjoying the comforts of the Country you betray ?",
