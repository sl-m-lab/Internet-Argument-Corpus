   "It's so nice to know that we are the land of the free and spreaders of democracy. Just look out how we are liberating Iraq. I'm glad to see that we are treating our prisoners of war with the utmost respect. They say that only 6 soldiers were involved in the act, but this is based on evidence of pictures they have and a beginning investigation. It was six soldiers \"guarding\" hundreds of prisoners. Would it not be the duty of the fellow soldiers to interject for this vile treatment? I guess it's not their problem. Or maybe we should take the Shawn Hannity approach and \"give the soldiers a little leeway.\" Our soldiers are asked to do a tough job, put their lives at risk, so if degrading, humiliating, and physically and mentally abusing people is necessary, well so be it. This is all in the name of liberation mind you. How do we expect the Iraqi people and the rest of the Middle East to love our democracy, when our soldiers are put into this situation and seem not to be so different than Mid East dictators or corrupt governments. We can say this is a war all we want but it is an occupation with reconstruction and without the \"hearts of the people,\" this \"situation\" will never be solved. \n \n Here's a quick video \n \n http://aolsvc.news.aol.com/news/video.adp?id=20040430200909990002 \n \n Remi",

It is nice to see that somebody finally brought this up here. \n \n This was not the only incident of abuse or torture of prisoners, there have been hundreds of reports. This is just the XXXXXX who were stupid enough to take pictures. This case (as well as the case involving the british soldier who was stupid enough to drop of pictures of an Iraqi being tortured at a commercil developing place) only serve to confirm that the hundreds of other cases probably hold some merit.\n \n This also explains some of the rather odd reports that come out of Iraq, such as the foreign fighters theory (even though we have captured so few of them). I happen to know that if you torture and/or abuse a prisoner long enough, they WILL admit to whatever you want them to and tell you whatever you want to hear.\n \n This also helps to explain why the opinion polls that you keep seeing are so pro-american, yet American troops keep getting attacked and Arab language forums seem to be overflowing with anti US sentiment from Iraqis. IF your government (yes, the US are actually an occuptional force, but for all intents an purpose they are serving the role of government) was dragging people off to prison and mistreating or torturing them, what would you say when asked on the street by an Amrican what you think?",
