For example, NARAL Pro-Choice America is a 501 c 4 tax-exempt organization which means unless it is an educational expenditure you can't tax deduct it. Normally this is like mem bership dues. The NARAL foundation I believe is tax exempt for donations. Never the less, my point was that the organiztion itself is tax-exempt. The reason I brought up churches and PP and NARAL is because many have problems with churches being tax-exempt but I was wondering if people had a problem with NARAL too. Like georged said, there is lost revenue from being tax-exempt and you gotta wonder if there is an activity going on that benefits tax-payers that the government would have to pay for otherwise. For example, Duke University is a private school that is tax exempt but they provide education which is good and thus would be tax exempt if georged had his way.\n \n In short, since you donate to NARAL you can't deduct since all they do is lobby...they are tax-exempt though.\n \n I found a good site to explain all of this...oddly enough it was in the same site I linked earily...Although the tax code explains it too. http://www.give.org/tips/tax.asp",

Most large C corps have a not-for-profit entity, often a foundation funded or partially funded by the namesake, that reports separately but is always mentioned in annual reports as PR.

They will be reported as looking similiar to a C corp, having what looks like an income statement and what looks like a balance sheet. Look at the financial statements for the American Diabetes Association. http://www.diabetes.org/uedocuments/ADA2004ConsolidatedFinancialStatements_1.pdf\n \n As you can see they have slightly different names such as the statement of activities. The reason for this is because they really have no revenue to match with an expense (as they have no products). They get revenue from donations and special events or membershipt fees...all of which go into different funds and are treated differently. You will also frequently see \"restricted\" as well...sometimes for endowments or something along those lines and restricted donations. Then you have conditional revenue too. Sometimes someone will say \"I will give you a million bucks once I run across the United States\"...a regular C corp reconginzes this as a revenue while a Not-for-profit won't. You can also see a difference in actitives such as \"supporting\" and \"program\" which are common among not-for-profit. These are just some differences that jump out off the top of my head.\n \n The reason you can't really seperate it out is because you can match an expense to any kind of revenue. Lets say you have a church that does charity work 50% of the time and preach 50% of the time. They get $100 in donations. The $100 goes to paying for the building with $10 left over. You might say that the expenses for the \"charity\" are 45 and the chruch preaching is 45. A church can then just say the donation will be 45 for the church preaching and 55 for the charity...you can do this because donations that are not restricted can be sent any way you want. So the church now has 0 income and thus no taxes and the charity who is tax-exempt has a profit which doesn't matter..because they are tax-exempt. It just makes it very difficult to split out charity work in a church. An organization like NARAL might be easier to not make tax-exempt because they don't do much in the ways of charity.

I am just talking about your basic church...obviously something bigger would be a little easier. You say that charity is defined that way but would all of the Red Cross be a charity? What about adminstrative related costs? If they all count then for a church you need to have some way to allocate these costs. Talk about getting complicated! You still have the issue if you have a charity foundation on the side of the church of determining where a donation goes. Since a church gets all money from donations you first gotta ask \"what is the actual transcaction here\". A common thing in tax is determining what actually accord? What does the donor get for donating the money? No product or service really (assuming no lobbying) and maybe you can claim a speech every week but you could see that for free if you wanted. Doesn't seem fair that the individual would be taxed on money they just gave away for no asset in return. Then we have the church which gets the money as a donation...you claim they expense it off to the charity that they run. Well, whats to keep them from expensing all the money to the charity but the ones to pay for their allocation of the expenses? This would make them have no profit and like the example I gave, the charity would then have a non-taxable gain. You could do this because the money was in fact a donation will no real restriction to use...as opposed to a company which gets money from a car (for example) and thus couldn't say that profit money really should go to a charity (although this did happen..kind of...as a tax shelter).

I don't even know if I support AARP lobbying and putting out political ads. As I said though, regular churches are a little hard to seperate but some big churches like the 700 club that lobbies and things like that...it makes a big differnce.
