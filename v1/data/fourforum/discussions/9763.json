   "How and in what context?\n Was it like: \"Oh bugger, Matthew just got eaten by a T-rex!\" or was it more like: \"Look at this big dino skeleton that I just found!\"\n\n \n The context was as living creatures that they coexisted with. Didn't you know that ? Why else do you think believers reject evo when we have written evidence these so called extinct animals lived among us ? Here's where some of the passages can be found.\n \n http://www.clarifyingchristianity.com/dinos.shtml\n The Bible's Text\n \n The Bible refers to many the common animals we know today. The list includes lions, wolves, bears, sheep, cattle and dogs along with various kinds of birds, rodents, reptiles, and insects. What is interesting is that this extensive list includes three animals that we no longer recognize. These three are (in the original Hebrew language) tanniyn, b@hemowth (yes, it's spelled correctly-at least as close as we can get in Roman characters), and livyathan.\n \n Although we alter the spelling of behemoth and Leviathan slightly, we still use those same words in bibles today. However, tanniyn is always translated into another word when we write it in English. Tanniyn occurs 28 times in the Bible and is normally translated \"dragon.\" It is also translated \"serpent,\" \"sea monster,\" \"dinosaur,\" \"great creature,\" and \"reptile.\" Behemoth and Leviathan are relatively specific creatures, perhaps each was a single kind of animal. Tanniyn is a more general term, and it can be thought of as the original version of the word \"dinosaur.\" The word \"dinosaur\" was originally coined in 1841, more than three thousand years after the Bible first referred to \"Tanniyn.\" To make things clearer, we constructed the following table comparing the scientific names with the Biblical names tanniyn, behemoth, and Leviathan.\n \n \"Dinosaur\" Names, Then and Now\n Name and date first written in the Bible Scientific Name (best estimate) and date the name appeared\n tanniyn (dragon) before 1400 BC dinosaur 1841 AD\n behemoth before 1400 BC brachiosaurus 1903 AD\n Leviathan before 1400 BC kronosaurus 1901 AD\n How we got these new names is interesting. In 1822, Mary Ann Mantell became the first person to discover and correctly identify a strange bone as part of a large, unknown reptile. Her husband, Dr. Gideon Mantell, later named this creature an \"Iguanodon.\" From that time forward, these forgotten animals were given names chosen by the people who rediscovered them. Of course, the Bible, written between approximately 1450 BC and 95 AD, does not include any of these names.\n \n Reading the Bible carefully, you will realize that no living creature matches the descriptions of behemoth and Leviathan. However, if you grab your kid's dinosaur book, you will notice several possible matches for each one. Let's examine those.\n \n Behemoth has the following attributes according to Job 40:15-24\n \n It \"eats grass like an ox.\"\n It \"moves his tail like a cedar.\" (In Hebrew, this literally reads, \"he lets hang his tail like a cedar.\")\n Its \"bones are like beams of bronze,\n His ribs like bars of iron.\"\n \"He is the first of the ways of God.\"\n \"He lies under the lotus trees,\n In a covert of reeds and marsh.\"\n Some bibles and study bibles will translate the word \"behemoth\" as \"elephant\" or \"hippopotamus.\" Others will put a note at the edge or bottom of the page, stating that behemoth was probably an elephant or a hippopotamus. Although an elephant or hippopotamus can eat grass (or lie in a covert of reeds and marsh), neither an elephant or a hippopotamus has a \"tail like a cedar\" (that is, a tail like a large, tapered tree trunk). In your kid's dinosaur book you will find lots of animals that have \"tails like a cedar.\"\n \n We would expect behemoth to be a large land animal whose bones are like beams of bronze and so forth, so whatever a behemoth is, it is large. A key phrase is \"He is the first of the ways of God.\" This phrase in the original Hebrew implied that behemoth was the biggest animal created. Although an elephant or a hippopotamus are big, they are less than one-tenth the size of a Brachiosaurus, the largest (complete) dinosaur ever discovered.[1] A Brachiosaurus could therefore easily be described as \"the first of the ways of God.\"\n \n Comparing all this information to the description in your kid's dinosaur book, you may come to the conclusion that \"behemoth\" is not a normal animal, it is a dinosaur-the brachiosaurus. We agree with that conclusion!\n \n Note: Some paleontologists have found fragmentary leg bones, ribs, or vertebrae which they propose belong to \"new\" sauropods larger than Brachiosaurus. Examples of these include Amphicoelias, Argentinasaurus, Sauroposeidon, Seismosaurus, Supersaurus and Ultrasaurus. There currently is not enough evidence to really determine the size of any of these, and some paleontologists believe that they are merely large examples of known dinosaurs like Brachiosaurus or Diplodocus. In any case, only the \"modern scientific name\" of behemoth would change. The point would still remain that behemoth refers to a dinosaur, not a \"modern animal\" like an elephant or hippopotamus.\n Leviathan has the following attributes according to Job chapter 41, Psalm 104:25,26 and Isaiah 27:1. This is only a partial listing-just enough to make the point.\n \n \"No one is so fierce that he would dare stir him up.\"\n \"Who can open the doors of his face, with his terrible teeth all around?\"\n \"His rows of scales are his pride, shut up tightly as with a seal; one is so near another that no air can come between them; they are joined one to another, they stick together and cannot be parted.\"\n \"His sneezings flash forth light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. Out of his mouth go burning lights; sparks of fire shoot out. Smoke goes out of his nostrils, as from a boiling pot and burning rushes. His breath kindles coals, and a flame goes out of his mouth.\"\n \"Though the sword reaches him, it cannot avail; nor does spear, dart, or javelin. He regards iron as straw, and bronze as rotten wood. The arrow cannot make him flee; slingstones become like stubble to him. Darts are regarded as straw; he laughs at the threat of javelins.\"\n \"On earth there is nothing like him, which is made without fear.\"\n Leviathan \"played\" in the \"great and wide sea\" (a paraphrase of Psalm 104 verses 25 and 26-get the exact sense by reading them yourself).\n Leviathan is a \"reptile [a] that is in the sea.\" (Isaiah 27:1)\n [a] Note: The word translated \"reptile\" here is the Hebrew word tanniyn. This shows that \"Leviathan\" was also a \"tanniyn\" (dragon).\n \n Unlike behemoth, who is huge, Leviathan is ferocious and terrifying. Many references (we have not listed them all) refer to the sea, so Leviathan is probably a sea creature. Although some bibles refer to Leviathan as an alligator or crocodile (and both of these are fierce) neither of these is a sea creature. They like the water, but they spend much of their time on land. Further, the question \"Who can open the doors of his face. . . .\" implies that nobody can open Leviathan's jaws. Although an alligator's jaws cannot normally be forced open, a punch to their sensitive snout or poke in eye might startle them enough to release their grip.[2] Although this is a good description of an alligator characteristic, it does not fit perfectly with the description of Leviathan, which in the context of the Bible was supposed to describe an essentially impossible event, and we are not done yet.\n \n The description of the scales is interesting. Several verses describe these great scales. Compared to Leviathan's armor, iron is like straw and arrows ca not make it flee. Let's face it, an arrow can do a lot of damage to a crocodile or alligator. This is not a description of either of them-or any living animal we are aware of.\n \n And now for the key ingredient: fire. It is hard to read Job 41:18-21 without realizing the Bible is telling us that Leviathan breathes fire. That alone will eliminate almost every living animal. Yes, there is one animal like that in today's world. It is called a bombardier beetle. This beetle is a native of Central America, and has a nozzle in its hind end that acts like a little flame thrower. It sprays a high-temperature jet of gas (fueled by hydroquinones and hydrogen peroxide with oxidative enzymes) for protection. Now, if a Central American beetle can do it, so could Leviathan. By the way, crocodiles and alligators are out of the picture on this one, don't you agree?\n \n Before we leave the topic of fire, there are two more notes you may find interesting:\n \n The history of every culture is filled with stories of fire-breathing dragons. If you think about it, in all the past ages wouldn't someone have made up a story of a fire-breathing lion or something? Nobody did because the dragon stories are based on truth, and only \"dragons\" breathed fire. It is easy to imagine Leviathan as a member of the dragon (tanniyn) family. (Plus, Isaiah 27:1 strongly implies this connection.)\n Many fossil dinosaur skulls contain unexplained, empty passages. Scientists have not been able to guess the reason for these passages. Would it make sense that some dinosaurs used these passages as \"gas tanks\" for the combustible mixture used to \"breathe fire?\" We believe it does.\n Comparing all this information to the description in your kid's dinosaur book, you may come up with the conclusion that Leviathan is a kronosaurus. We have heard (and read) other suggestions, but the kronosaurus is the best match of any known creature to the description of Leviathan.",

   "Now for your reading pleasure is documented secular sources for many sightings that have occured much more recently than the Old Testament references in the bible that you will no doubt scoff at in your typical elitist manner. But how do you disregard the actual sighting that common people reported to authorities of their period that rather than be considered the lunatic ravings of crazy people were responded to by recording the sightings for posterity or actually forming hunting parties to track down the beasts ? \n \n Dinosaurs In History \n The Evidence Left Behind \n \u00a9TrueAuthority.com - 02\n \n The dragon . . . one of the principle and most powerful, prevalent symbols of history as we know it. How could such reverential, awe-inspiring creatures of man's simple imagination have such an impact upon almost every civilization of the past? Could it be, just perhaps, that what countless numbers of people have written about through the course of time could have been actual, living animals? To some this seems absurd, but when all the facts and truths are put together, much more than myth and legend are revealed.\n \n \n Introduction\n \n To test this assertion, we will now examine the issue by considering the written evidence that has survived from the records of various ancient peoples that describe, sometimes in most graphic detail, human encounters with living giant reptiles that we today would call dinosaurs. And as we shall see, some of those records are not so ancient.\n \n First, however, let's briefly look at the common \"dragon knowledge\" we read from our history books. The ancient Norsemen adorned the prows of their vessels with carved likenesses of dragons. Among the Celtic conquerors of Britain the dragon was a symbol of sovereignty. Dragons were also depicted on the shields of the Teutonic tribes that later invaded Britain, and it appeared on the battle standards of the English kings as late as the 16th century. Beginning in the early 20th century, it was inscribed on the armorial bearings of the Prince of Wales.\n \n The dragon also figures in the mythology of various Oriental countries, notably Japan and China. It is deified in the Daoist (Taoist) religion and was the national emblem of the Chinese Empire. Among the Chinese people, the dragon is traditionally regarded as a symbol of good fortune.[1]\n \n More than myths and legends, however, we find a numerous amount of accurate historical accounts of \"dinosaur-like\" dragons from all around the world.\n \n Following from source [2]\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n FRANCE\n \n The city of Nerluc was renamed in honor of the killing of a \"dragon\" there. This animal was bigger than an ox and had long, sharp, pointed horns on its head. There were a number of different horned dinosaurs. The Triceratops is one example.\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n ITALY\n \n A scientist named Ulysses Aldrovandus carefully described a small \"dragon\" seen along a farm road in northern Italy. The date was May 13, 1572. The poor, rare creature was so small that a farmer killed it just by knocking it on the head with his walking stick.\n \n The animal had done nothing wrong but hiss at the farmer's oxen as they approached it on the road. The scientist got the dead body and made measurements and a drawing. He even had the animal mounted for a museum. It had a long neck, a very long tail and a fat body.\n \n The skeletons of a number of ancient reptile-like creatures match this basic description.\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n CHINA\n \n Thousands of dragon stories and pictures can be found in ancient Chinese books and art. One interesting legend tells about a famous Chinese man named Yu. After the great world flood, Yu surveyed the land of China and divided it into sections. He \"built channels to drain the water off to the sea\" and helped make the land livable again. Many snakes and \"dragons\" were driven from the marshlands when Yu created the new farmlands.\n \n Ancient Chinese books even tell of a family that kept \"dragons\" and raised babies. It is said that in those days, Chinese kings used \"dragons\" for pulling royal chariots on special occasions, a fact of which famous explorer Marco Polo himself attested to.\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Summary\n \n Over the years of time, truth can often become distorted; events are exaggerated, facts are made more exciting. This, we believe, is the case with dinosaurs and dragons. Today we think of them as magical, mystical, fictitious beings, but as any historian will tell you, almost all legends and myths are based on true, actual facts and events. A fire-breathing dragon? Is it possible? Scientists still are puzzled by hollow naval cavities found in the skulls of many dinosaur specimens found today. They seem to serve no purpose. Or did they?\n \n Delve into this exciting topic. We ask the skeptic to read, observe the evidence, and keep an open mind. History, we hope, will never be the same.\n \n \n -----------------------------------\n DINOSAUR EXTINCTION\n Putting Two and Two Together...\n \n If one was to conduct a questionnaire, a questionnaire putting forth one simple question, given to people of average intelligence, a result would entail revealing an astounding \"hidden knowledge\" inherent in us human beings. It would be as follows:\n \n \"What historical animal, real or fictitious, do we have more stories about being killed because of its threat to people?\"\n \n It might take a brief minute of thinking, but the majority would unquestionably reply \"A dragon.\" Why? Why do we have so many legends, accounts, and fire-side tales of these large, ferocious, reptilian creatures? . . . and why, to step further, are they all acquainted with death? Why is there always a knight, noble, king, or peasant, sent by the people to slay the dragon? And why, we must honestly ask ourselves, do dragons possess so many similarities to what we today know as dinosaurs?\n \n Let us begin with the first question. As every historian will tell you, historical legends are all based on some amount of fact, i.e. King Arthur, Robin Hood, Gilgamesh, etc. More then just your common stories, legends do in fact open the door in allowing us to, in a sense, go back in time. We can ponder the truths given in the legend of St. George and his encounter with a reptilian animal. While some dragon legends possess exaggerations, magic and marvelous deeds, the account of St. George is free from any of this.\n \n However, when one finds actual accounts, accounts written as if one was writing about an encounter with a lion or bear of today, the notion that dinosaurs were only animals of \"pre-historic times\" becomes absurd.\n \n \n DINOSAURS IN HISTORY\n British Isles - Anglo-Saxon Records [3]\n \n One account takes us back to the days of the early Britons, from whom the modern Welsh are descended. They provide us with our earliest surviving European accounts of reptilian monsters, one of whom killed and devoured King Morvidus in 336 B.C. We are told in the amazing account, translated for us by Geoffrey of Monmouth, that the monster \"gulped down the body of Morvidus as a big fish swallows a little one.\" Geoffrey himself described the animal as a Belua. The Belua was described as reptilian, and when we endeavor to compare it with any other animal of today, coupled with the fact that it gulped down Morvidus \"as a big fish swallows a little one,\" we find it difficult in doing so. No land animal of today, let alone reptilian, could devour a human by such standards. Therefore, Geoffrey was either a flat out liar, or he told the truth.\n \n In the British Isles alone there are approximately 200 locations in which dinosaur activity has been reported. Going into the future to the year 1405, we now visit Bures in Soffolk, where a chronicle reveals to us the physical reality of yet another dinosaur:\n \n \"Close to the town of Bures, near Sudbury, there has lately appeared, to the great hurt of the countryside, a dragon, vast in body, with a crested head, teeth like a saw, and a tail extending to an enormous length. Having slaughtered the shepherd of a flock, it devoured many sheep.\"\n \n After an unsuccessful attempt by local archers to kill the beast, due to its impenetrable hide:\n \n \"...in order to destroy him, all the country people around were summoned. But when the dragon saw that he was again to be assailed with arrows, he fled into a marsh or mere and there hid himself among the long reeds, and was no more seen.\"\n \n As you continue to read, you may perhaps think to yourself, \"Why aren't these chronicles from history more well known? Why have I not heard or read about these things before?\" Sadly, most historians throw aside these accounts, simply because the word \"dragon\" is used. As the term \"dinosaur\" wasn't invented until the 1800s, to do so is foolish and a detriment to history itself.\n \n In the 15th century, according to a contemporary chronicle that still survives in Canterbury Cathedral's library, the following incident was reported. On the afternoon of Friday, September 26, 1449, two giant reptiles were seen fighting on the banks of the River Stour (near the village of Little Cornard) which marked the English county borders of Suffolk and Essex. One was black, and the other \"reddish and spotted\". After an hour-long struggle that took place \"to the admiration of many beholding them\", the black monster yielded and returned to its lair, the scene of the conflict being known ever since as Sharpfight Meadow.\n \n As late as August, 1614, the following sober account was given of a strange reptile that was encountered in St. Leonard's Forest in Sussex.\n \n The sighting was near a village that was known as 'Dragon's Green' long before this report was published. Original writing has been kept for authenticity:\n \n \"This serpent is reputed to be nine feete, or rather more, in length, and shaped almost in the form of an axletree of a cart: a quantite of thickness in the middest, and somewhat smaller at both endes. The former part, which he shootes forth as a necke, is supposed to be an elle long (3 ft. 9 inch); with a white ring, as it were, of scales about it. The scales along his back seem to be blackish, and so much as is discovered under his bellie, appeareth to be red . . . it is likewise discovered to have large feete, but the eye may there be deceived, for some suppose that serpents have no feete . . . (The dragon) rids away as fast as a man can run. His food (rabbits) is thought to be, for the most part, in a conie-warren, which he much frequents . . . There are likewise upon either side of him discovered two great bunches so big as a large foote-ball, and (as some thinke) will in time grow to wings, but God, I hope, will (to defend the poor people in the neighbourhood) that he shall be destroyed before he grows to fledge.\"\n \n This dragon was reportedly seen in various places within a circuit of three or four miles, and the pamphlet named some of the still-living witnesses who had seen him. These included as follows: John Steele, Christopher Holder, and a certain \"widow woman dwelling neare Faygate\". Another witness was \"the carrier of Horsham, who lieth at the White Horse (inn) in Southwark\". One of the locals set his two mastiffs onto the monster, and apart from losing his dogs, he was fortunate to escape with his own life, for the dragon was already credited with the deaths of a man and woman at whom it had spat and how consequently had been killed by its venom. When approached unwittingly, our pamphleteer tells us the monster was:\n \n \"...of countenance very proud and at the sight or hearing of men or cattel will raise his neck upright and seem to listen and looke about, with great arrogancy.\"\n \n Fascinating . . . a true eyewitness account of typically reptilian behavior.\n \n Going ahead to the year 1867, less than 200 years ago (2 years after the American Civil War), the monster that lived in the woods around Fittleworth in Sussex was last seen. It would reportedly run up to people hissing and spitting if they happened to stumble across it unawares, although it never harmed anyone. Several such cases could be cited, but suffice it to say that too many incidents like these are reported down through the centuries and from all sorts of locations for us to say that they are all fairy-tales.\n \n VENOMOUS SALIVA?\n \n Let us stop for a moment to consider an interesting and historically repeated fact. Some of these reptilian monsters, as reported here twice, are said to have spit at their enemies. Not only that, their saliva was said to be lethal. Being acquainted with Hollywood, one immediately thinks back upon the blockbuster hit, Jurassic Park, in which a Dilophosaurus spits at and kills a main character. Amazingly, the description given in the 1405 account seems to accurately portray a living Dilophosaurus, as shown right. Again, the animal was \"vast in body, with a crested head, teeth like a saw, and a tail extending to an enormous length.\"\n \n DILOPHOSAURUS\n \n What distinguishes itself the most among these descriptions is the \"crested head.\" The name Dilophosaurus means \"two-crested lizard.\" It was given this name for the two ridges, or crests, of very thin bone, that ran side by side on its head, from behind the eyes to the tip of the nose.\n \n \"Vast in body...\"\n \n The Dilophosaurus could grow to a length of 20 feet (6 meters), and was extremely thick.\n \n \"Teeth like a saw...\"\n \n The Dilophosaurus is notorious in the scientific community for its razor sharp teeth. It also possessed three-fingered hands attached with sharp-claws. From the look of its skeleton, it appeared to be an extremely fierce hunter.\n \n One other note of interest are the crests of this particular dinosaur. The bone is as thin as paper, making it an obviously delicate (and vulnerable) part of its body. A typical question you may find when reading about a Dilophosaurus is, \"Could it have attacked and fought other large dinosaurs without damaging its delicate crest? Or did it prey only on small creatures?\" Believing that a few species of this animal were still alive only a few hundred years ago, the logical conclusion to this question would be the latter question . . . small creatures.\n \n The following is a list of locations throughout Britain where dinosaur activity has been historically reported:\n \n Aller, Somerset; Anwick, Lincolnshire; Bamburgh, Nothumberland; Beckhole, North Yorkshire; Bedd-yr-Afranc, Wales; Ben Vair, Scotland; Bignor Hill, West Sussex; Bishop Auckland, Durham; Bisterne, Hampshire; Brent Pelham, Hertfordshire; Brinsop, Hereford and Worcester; Bures, Suffolk; Cadbury Castle, Devon; Carhampton, Somerset; Castle Carlton, Lincolnshire; Castle Neroche, Somerset; Challacombe, Devon; Churchstanton, Somerset; Cnoc-na-Cnoimh, Scotland; Crowcombe, Somerset; Dalry, Scotland; Deerhurst, Gloucestershire; Dol-y-Carrog, Wales; Dragonhoard, Oxfordshire; Drake Howe, North Yorkshire; Drakelow, Derbyshire; Drakelowe, Worcestershire; Filey Brigg, North Yorkshire; Handale Priory, North Yorkshire; Henham, Essex; Hornden, Essex; Kellington, North Yorkshire; Kilve, Somerset; Kingston St. Mary, Somerset; Lambton Castle, Durham; Linton, Scotland; Little Cornard, Suffolk; Llandeilo Graban, Wales; Llanraeadr-ym-Mochnant, Wales; Llyn Barfog, Wales; Llyn Cynwch, Wales; Llyn Llion, Wales; Llyn-y-Gader, Wales; Llyn-yr-Afanc, Wales; Loch Awe, Scotland; Loch Maree, Scotland; Loch Morar, Scotland; Loch Ness, Scotland; Loch Rannoch, Scotland; Longwitton, Northumberland; Ludham, Norfolk; Lyminster, West Sussex; Manaton, Devon; Money Hill, Northumberland; Moston, Cheshire; Newcastle Emlyn, Wales; Norton Fitzwarren, Hereford and Worcester; Nunnington, North Yorkshire; Old Field Barrows, Shropshire; Penllin Castle, Wales; Penmark, Wales; Penmynydd, Wales; St. Albans, Hertfordshire; St. Leonard's Forest, West Sussex; St. Osyth, Essex; Saffron Waldon, Essex; Sexhow, North Yorkshire; Shervage Wood, Hereford and Worcester; Slingsby, North Yorkshire; Sockburn, Durham; Stinchcombe, Gloucestershire; Strathmartin, Scotland; Walmsgate, Lincolnshire; Wantley, South Yorkshire; Well, North Yorkshire; Wherwell, Hampshire; Whitehorse Hill, Oxfordshire; Winkleigh, Devon; Wiston, Wales; Wormelow Tump, Hereford and Worcester; Wormingford, Essex.\n \n \n -----------------------------------\n FOR US TO SEE...FOR US TO READ\n What Our Ancestors Have Left Behind...\n \n The arguments against dinosaurs existing in recent history become more and more desperate as the truth unfolds. The next weapon the skeptic often unsheathes is a question, unfortunately, many individuals have a hard time answering:\n \n \"What painting, drawings, or carvings do we find of living dinosaurs? Animals of all kinds have been artistically portrayed all throughout history, so why not dinosaurs?\"\n \n Sadly, only ignorance cannot give an ample answer to this question. Take, for instance, the Roman mosaic shown to the right. Dated around the 2nd century A.D., this piece of artwork portrays two large, long-necked animals. No fanciful wings, no multiple heads, no magical, mythical characteristics . . . simply two large creatures that the artist took his time to portray. Trusting that the animals were based upon first-hand experience, and taking into account that the artist deliberately placed them by the sea, it would appear that these were a species of Tanystropheus, an aquatic, webbed dinosaur.[2]\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n We now move on to a phenomenon which occurred almost 40 years ago. Known as the Ica Stones of Peru, they first came to the attention of the scientific community in 1966 when Dr. Javier Cabrera, a local physician, received a small, carved rock for his birthday from a poor native. The carving on the rock looked ancient to Dr. Cabrera, but intrigued him because it seemed to depict a primitive fish. Hearing that the doctor was interested in the stone, local natives began to bring him more, which they collected from a river bank. This soon developed into a vast collection of more than 50,000 stones, many etched with seemingly impossible scenes. Whereas it might be difficult to prove that the fish represented a long-extinct species, as Dr. Cabrera thought, other scenes carved on other stones are not so ambiguous. They clearly depict such dinosaurs as triceratops, stegosaurus, apatosaurus, and human figures riding on the backs of flying pterodactyls. What's more, some of the scenes are of men hunting and killing dinosaurs. Others show men watching the heavens through what look like telescopes, performing open-heart surgery, and cesarean section births.\n \n As many ancient civilizations were more advanced then previously thought, telescopes and performed surgeries should not come as a surprise. However, to see dinosaurs etched on these stones does come as a surprise (to many). Again, in all, more than 50,000 stones discovered, varying in size from that of a baseball to as large as a sofa. As a first thought, the mere large number of them indicates that they are indeed genuine 'relics.' However, more proof is needed, and of that, such proof exists.\n \n The stones themselves are composed of andesite, a very hard mineral that would make etching quite difficult with primitive tools. They are covered with a natural varnish that is created by bacteria over thousands of years. The etching is made by scraping away this dark varnish to reveal the lighter mineral beneath. According to some reports, examinations of the stones show that the grooves of the etchings also bear traces of additional varnish, however, indicating that they are very old.\n \n Ica natives had, in fact, been selling such stones to the tourist trade. Interestingly, the natives of the area can still be seen today making etchings on stones in the style of the Ica Stones to sell to tourists. However, the distinction between their product and the \"genuine\" stones is that the newly etched stones clearly scrape away all of the varnish. In essence, the present-day Ica's cannot make them like the ones found years ago. This, of course, is a very significant fact. \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n At a museum in Manitou Springs, Colorado, exists an artifact on display that has raised more questions than anything else ever discovered in the area; An Indian prayer stick, roughly a foot long, with a crested head, eyes on both sides, and a mouth. When looked upon by anyone acquainted with \"prehistoric reptiles,\" whether it be the common 4-year old to the respected paleontologist, its identity simply cannot, and will not, be ignored. The artistically and well-defined head of a Pterodactyl stands atop the stick, raising many questions of how they molded the head of a species long extinct, and why they did so. Many legends exist of large \"reptilian birds\" in the area, and this, as of now, appears to be the only realistic answer.\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n The portrayal from a Saxon shield discovered years ago reveals the same unmistakable creature. A flying reptile at rest, wings folded along its sides, a long beak, and that full of teeth. Comparison of this with a modern reconstruction of a Pterodactyl or similar animal is most instructive, especially when looking back into Anglo-Saxon history. As late as the beginning of the present century, elderly folk at Penllin in Glamorgan used to tell of a colony of winged serpents that lived in the woods around Penllin Castle. As Marie Trevelyan tells us:\n \n \"The woods around Penllin Castle, Glamorgan, had the reputation of being frequented by winged serpents, and these were the terror of old and young alike. An aged inhabitant of Penllyne, who died a few years ago, said that in his boyhood the winged serpents were described as very beautiful. They were coiled when in repose, and 'looked as if they were covered with jewels of all sorts. Some of them had crests sparkling with all the colours of the rainbow.' When disturbed they glided swiftly, 'sparkling all over', to their hiding places. When angry, they 'flew over people's heads, with outspread wings bright, and sometimes with eyes too, like the feathers in a peacock's tail'. He said it was 'no old story invented to frighten children', but a real fact. His father and uncle had killed some of them, for they were as bad as foxes for poultry. The old man attributed the extinction of the winged serpents to the fact that they were 'terrors in the farmyards and coverts'.\"[3]\n \n This account is intriguing in many respects, not the least being the fact that it is not a typical account of dragons. The creatures concerned were not solitary and monstrous beasts, but small creatures that lived in colonies.\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n A stone can be seen inside the church of SS. Mary and Hardulph at Breedon-on-the-Hill in Leicestershire . . . a stone with very peculiar, graphic engravings; A portrayal from Saxon times of an attack on a herd of long-necked quadrupeds (four-legged) by a bipedal (two-legged) predator. Note the predator's two large legs and puny forelimbs. This portrayal conforms very closley indeed to the description of Grendel, and is a clear indication that such creatures were to be seen on the British mainland as well as the Continent, as is also shown by Athelstan's and other charters.[3]\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n In 1902, a group of scientists and workmen dug up part of the wall of a 2,500-year-old city. On that wall was a mystery.\n \n The city was Babylon, which once stood on the banks of the Euphrates River in the Near East, in what is now the nation of Iraq. Babylon was once the capital of the kingdom of Babylonia, one of the world's greatest cities. It was a huge square of houses, temples, and palaces, surrounded by a high wall made of shiny, colored bricks. What scientists discovered and dug up was a part of the wall with a gateway. The gateway was decorated with sculptors of three kinds of animals, arranged in rows. One animal was a lion, while another was a bull. The third, however, was a strange creature such as none of the scientists had ever seen before.\n \n The creature had a scaly body with a long tail and a long snakelike neck. A forked tongue, like the tongue of a snake, stuck out its mouth, and a long horn stuck up from its forehead. Its front legs looked much like the legs and feet of a cat. However, it had scaly back legs, along with clawed feet. Whatever animal this thing was, the portrayer certainly made it clear that it was a reptile. Interestingly, the artists had shown the muscles and skin and hair of the lion and bull so well that those animals looked almost real. And what they showed of this creature, too, looked almost real.\n \n Surprising though it seems, even though the scientists had never seen this creature before, they knew what it was supposed to be, for the king, that is, King Nebuchadnezzar, had left writings that described the decoration. The writings, found and translated, revealed that Nebuchadnezzar had called the creature a Sirrush, which was the Babylonian word for Dragon.[4]\n \n In some versions of the Bible, contained in the last few chapters of Daniel, the Sirrush is made mention of. In fact, it is the subject of a controversial situation. The Sirrush, or dragon, was kept in a temple in Babylon during the days of Nebuchadnezzar. This creature was worshipped as a god, and according to the story, the Hebrew prophet Daniel proved that the creature was not a god by feeding it poisoned food, which eventually killed it.\n \n Whether or not we today regard the Sirrush as a living, breathing animal, King Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians did, and it perhaps would be wise for us to give them the benefit of the doubt.\n \n Much more could be written about dinosaurs throughout the history of mankind, and such will be written. For now, consider not only the possibility of dinosaurs alongside man, but moreso, the distinct probability. \n \n \n \n References:\n \n 1.

True, this photographic evidence fly's in the face of all of your preconcieved notions, but you must admit it defies the argument that these creatures have been extinct for 60 million years.\n\n \n And there is no evidence the picture is authentic. My father used to this as well. All one needs to do is print out a old picture, soak it in coffee for a few days and BAM it looks old. Furthermore the site even states that they don't have information about the picture. \n \n \nAnd if they were around less than 200 years ago, what does that say for never dating even one fossil evos have found at less than millions of years old.\n\n \n If a PTERODACTYLS survived it wouldn't prove evolution wrong. Crocodiles are still around and many of the species we see today have changed very little since their ancestors millions of years ago. Just because you have no idea what evolution is doesn't mean we do not.\n \nCould my constant assertions that deceptions are rampant have some validity now?\n\n \n Hardly. Roaches remain largely unchanged for millions of years. They don't prove evolution is wrong. Horsecrabs are the same. All they do is prove that once a species has adapted to a niche it can stay that way if enviromental pressures do not force it to change. Evolution predicts this and low and behold IT HAPPENS! Creationism on the other hand hasn't gotten anything right yet. \n \n \nI mean, shouldn't at least some of the fossils be from the modern era if we are to believe the many first hand accounts described in the above posts?\n\n \n Why? Furthermore if something had died in the past 50,000 years it would be able to be carbon dated. Funny that doesn't happen. \n \n \n. But now I'll expect the scoffing and mocking to start, but no evidence to substantiate your ridiculous claims of soft tissue lasting 60 million years when I have just provided good evidence that it is very reasonable to believe that the soft tissue from the T-Rex isn't more than a few thousand years old at best. That dinos and in fact dragons are contemporaries of humans, not distant evolutionary descendents.\n\n \n Wrong. All you did was ignore that the soft tissue wasn't what you defined a soft tissue. I already provided you with two links actually explaining what was found, you have so far ignored both of them. The common dishonest creationist (remember, creation's mantra is to lie, cheat, steal and fabricate) tactic is to misrepresent what was found and then cast it as something it is clearly not. Your refusal to even read the links by the researchers who actually studied the material is a sign of that. \n \n Furthermore, a dragon as a traditional concept is impossible. A T-rex to run 30 mph would require over 60% of its body mass to be thigh muscle (hence why many scientists now believe T-rex was a scavenger). For a Dragon on similar size to FLY, would require easily over 80% of its body mass to be wing muscle. No organism in the world has that kind of muscle.\n \n As for the cave drawings, there are several serious problems with that. First of all, if the indians actually did live with the dinosaurs, they got the wrong animal. A aptosaurs didn't walk like that. The tail is a counter balance to the neck. The neck wouldn't have been up like that, but paralell to the ground, same with the tail. It looks like the cartoon drawings on kid's tv, not how anatomically the organism walked.\n \n Here's about 14 pages of discussion on that picture",

Why are you so gullible?

Maybe you should do some research before submitting something that is a proven hoax.\n \n http://www.lorencoleman.com/museum.html\n \n From that link: \nThe \"Mystery Civil War Pterodactyl\"\n \n An internet rumor began in the late 1990s that this photograph was found squeezed between the pages of a 1970s paranormal book purchased at a thrift store. For years, Forteans had searched for the exclusive \"Thunderbird\" photograph seen and remembered by zoologist Ivan T. Sanderson during the 1960s. Then, this newly discovered picture raised the question of its relationship to the Sanderson \"lost Thunderbird photo.\" But something seemed wrong. The Sanderson stories told of a Thunderbird tacked to the side of a barn in Tombstone, Arizona, or some other location in the Old West. The photograph shown here, however, appeared to have captured a group of Civil War soldiers, circa 1860s, with the remains of a pterodactyl. Was this the long lost photograph, remembered by so many, but never found after decades of looking for it?\n \n As it turned out this photograph was a promotional tool of Orlando, Florida's Haxan Production (producers of \"The Blair Witch Project\"), to develop interest in their forthcoming fictional program, \"Freaky Links.\" The series, first broadcast on Fox TV, finally in 2000, involved the character \"Derek Barnes,\" an investigator of the unknown.\n \n The picture was a hoax and the pterodactyl was a prop created exclusively for two episodes of Freaky Links. Fox is done with the prop, however, and this intriguing pseudo-cryptid was acquired by Loren Coleman, and is now part of the collection of the Museum--that is all 22 feet by 11 feet of it.\n \n Photograph used with permission of Gregg Hale, Executive Director, Haxan Productions. Credit, Fox TV. \n \n\n \n From another site: Civil War Pterodactyl\n \nFortean Times ran a very skeptical article about this photo in its May 2000 issue, concluding with these words: \"We believe he's a hoaxer but a clever and well-informed one as the site is full of excellent fortean jokes--e.g., the rather disgusting photo of a toilet bowl thoughtfully snapped after some unfortunate had just vomited frogs.\"\n \n Further doubts soon emerged after the magazine's article was published. Various readers wrote to pinpoint several details in the photo that led to the conclusion that the photo was a fake. First of all, the men pictured were obviously reenactors, \"given the undue proportion of over-age and overweight members in their ranks--the average Civil War soldier was a scrawny youth of nineteen.\" Such groups of re-enactors are quite common in the States and, among them \"there is a much higher proportion of older and fatter members than in the original armies.\" The clean and neat uniforms \"also mark them out as re-enactors rather than the real thing.\" Their poses, also, are \"too naturalistic for an 1860s photograph\"; if you've ever looked at photos from that period \"you can see there are a dozen subtle differences in the way they stood, the way they held their heads, the looks on their faces, and what they did with their arms and hands while they were being photographed.\"\n \n Finally, all doubts were confirmed when it was discovered that the site was connected to the creators of The Blair Witch Project. FreakyLinks was in fact the title of an upcoming TV series, and the site was designed to promote interest in it. The show star was actor Ethan Embry and his character was named \"Derek Barnes, Editor of an Internet Web site that investigates the paranormal.\" As expected, the experts quoted in the site were imaginary, just as the pterodactyl that was only a stage prop courtesy of Fox.\n \n Bolding and underlining in both quotes are mine.\n \n There are numerous more, you were duped, man. And your conspiracy theories are getting both out of control and sickening. Say hello to the Raelians for me.",

   "But please explain these cave drawings and how primitive indians could draw such accurate cave drawings of creatures we now know to have existed through science but they could never have known about from 60 million year old bones. Can you explain that OC ?\n \n http://www.omniology.com/AnasaziDino.html\n\n \n You guys are real good at picking and choosing the points you'll respond to. but until you answer, rather than just mock how the anasazi drew creatures that were allegedly extinct for 60 million years and these eye witness accounts from between 300 AD and 1680 AD then you're just proving how deeply in denial you are to the real facts. \n \n Dinosaurs In History \n The Evidence Left Behind \n \u00a9TrueAuthority.com - 02\n \n The dragon . . . one of the principle and most powerful, prevalent symbols of history as we know it. How could such reverential, awe-inspiring creatures of man's simple imagination have such an impact upon almost every civilization of the past? Could it be, just perhaps, that what countless numbers of people have written about through the course of time could have been actual, living animals? To some this seems absurd, but when all the facts and truths are put together, much more than myth and legend are revealed.\n \n \n Introduction\n \n To test this assertion, we will now examine the issue by considering the written evidence that has survived from the records of various ancient peoples that describe, sometimes in most graphic detail, human encounters with living giant reptiles that we today would call dinosaurs. And as we shall see, some of those records are not so ancient.\n \n First, however, let's briefly look at the common \"dragon knowledge\" we read from our history books. The ancient Norsemen adorned the prows of their vessels with carved likenesses of dragons. Among the Celtic conquerors of Britain the dragon was a symbol of sovereignty. Dragons were also depicted on the shields of the Teutonic tribes that later invaded Britain, and it appeared on the battle standards of the English kings as late as the 16th century. Beginning in the early 20th century, it was inscribed on the armorial bearings of the Prince of Wales.\n \n The dragon also figures in the mythology of various Oriental countries, notably Japan and China. It is deified in the Daoist (Taoist) religion and was the national emblem of the Chinese Empire. Among the Chinese people, the dragon is traditionally regarded as a symbol of good fortune.[1]\n \n More than myths and legends, however, we find a numerous amount of accurate historical accounts of \"dinosaur-like\" dragons from all around the world.\n \n Following from source [2]\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n FRANCE\n \n The city of Nerluc was renamed in honor of the killing of a \"dragon\" there. This animal was bigger than an ox and had long, sharp, pointed horns on its head. There were a number of different horned dinosaurs. The Triceratops is one example.\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n ITALY\n \n A scientist named Ulysses Aldrovandus carefully described a small \"dragon\" seen along a farm road in northern Italy. The date was May 13, 1572. The poor, rare creature was so small that a farmer killed it just by knocking it on the head with his walking stick.\n \n The animal had done nothing wrong but hiss at the farmer's oxen as they approached it on the road. The scientist got the dead body and made measurements and a drawing. He even had the animal mounted for a museum. It had a long neck, a very long tail and a fat body.\n \n The skeletons of a number of ancient reptile-like creatures match this basic description.\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n CHINA\n \n Thousands of dragon stories and pictures can be found in ancient Chinese books and art. One interesting legend tells about a famous Chinese man named Yu. After the great world flood, Yu surveyed the land of China and divided it into sections. He \"built channels to drain the water off to the sea\" and helped make the land livable again. Many snakes and \"dragons\" were driven from the marshlands when Yu created the new farmlands.\n \n Ancient Chinese books even tell of a family that kept \"dragons\" and raised babies. It is said that in those days, Chinese kings used \"dragons\" for pulling royal chariots on special occasions, a fact of which famous explorer Marco Polo himself attested to.\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Summary\n \n Over the years of time, truth can often become distorted; events are exaggerated, facts are made more exciting. This, we believe, is the case with dinosaurs and dragons. Today we think of them as magical, mystical, fictitious beings, but as any historian will tell you, almost all legends and myths are based on true, actual facts and events. A fire-breathing dragon? Is it possible? Scientists still are puzzled by hollow naval cavities found in the skulls of many dinosaur specimens found today. They seem to serve no purpose. Or did they?\n \n Delve into this exciting topic. We ask the skeptic to read, observe the evidence, and keep an open mind. History, we hope, will never be the same.\n \n \n -----------------------------------\n DINOSAUR EXTINCTION\n Putting Two and Two Together...\n \n If one was to conduct a questionnaire, a questionnaire putting forth one simple question, given to people of average intelligence, a result would entail revealing an astounding \"hidden knowledge\" inherent in us human beings. It would be as follows:\n \n \"What historical animal, real or fictitious, do we have more stories about being killed because of its threat to people?\"\n \n It might take a brief minute of thinking, but the majority would unquestionably reply \"A dragon.\" Why? Why do we have so many legends, accounts, and fire-side tales of these large, ferocious, reptilian creatures? . . . and why, to step further, are they all acquainted with death? Why is there always a knight, noble, king, or peasant, sent by the people to slay the dragon? And why, we must honestly ask ourselves, do dragons possess so many similarities to what we today know as dinosaurs?\n \n Let us begin with the first question. As every historian will tell you, historical legends are all based on some amount of fact, i.e. King Arthur, Robin Hood, Gilgamesh, etc. More then just your common stories, legends do in fact open the door in allowing us to, in a sense, go back in time. We can ponder the truths given in the legend of St. George and his encounter with a reptilian animal. While some dragon legends possess exaggerations, magic and marvelous deeds, the account of St. George is free from any of this.\n \n However, when one finds actual accounts, accounts written as if one was writing about an encounter with a lion or bear of today, the notion that dinosaurs were only animals of \"pre-historic times\" becomes absurd.\n \n \n DINOSAURS IN HISTORY\n British Isles - Anglo-Saxon Records [3]\n \n One account takes us back to the days of the early Britons, from whom the modern Welsh are descended. They provide us with our earliest surviving European accounts of reptilian monsters, one of whom killed and devoured King Morvidus in 336 B.C. We are told in the amazing account, translated for us by Geoffrey of Monmouth, that the monster \"gulped down the body of Morvidus as a big fish swallows a little one.\" Geoffrey himself described the animal as a Belua. The Belua was described as reptilian, and when we endeavor to compare it with any other animal of today, coupled with the fact that it gulped down Morvidus \"as a big fish swallows a little one,\" we find it difficult in doing so. No land animal of today, let alone reptilian, could devour a human by such standards. Therefore, Geoffrey was either a flat out liar, or he told the truth.\n \n In the British Isles alone there are approximately 200 locations in which dinosaur activity has been reported. Going into the future to the year 1405, we now visit Bures in Soffolk, where a chronicle reveals to us the physical reality of yet another dinosaur:\n \n \"Close to the town of Bures, near Sudbury, there has lately appeared, to the great hurt of the countryside, a dragon, vast in body, with a crested head, teeth like a saw, and a tail extending to an enormous length. Having slaughtered the shepherd of a flock, it devoured many sheep.\"\n \n After an unsuccessful attempt by local archers to kill the beast, due to its impenetrable hide:\n \n \"...in order to destroy him, all the country people around were summoned. But when the dragon saw that he was again to be assailed with arrows, he fled into a marsh or mere and there hid himself among the long reeds, and was no more seen.\"\n \n As you continue to read, you may perhaps think to yourself, \"Why aren't these chronicles from history more well known? Why have I not heard or read about these things before?\" Sadly, most historians throw aside these accounts, simply because the word \"dragon\" is used. As the term \"dinosaur\" wasn't invented until the 1800s, to do so is foolish and a detriment to history itself.\n \n In the 15th century, according to a contemporary chronicle that still survives in Canterbury Cathedral's library, the following incident was reported. On the afternoon of Friday, September 26, 1449, two giant reptiles were seen fighting on the banks of the River Stour (near the village of Little Cornard) which marked the English county borders of Suffolk and Essex. One was black, and the other \"reddish and spotted\". After an hour-long struggle that took place \"to the admiration of many beholding them\", the black monster yielded and returned to its lair, the scene of the conflict being known ever since as Sharpfight Meadow.\n \n As late as August, 1614, the following sober account was given of a strange reptile that was encountered in St. Leonard's Forest in Sussex.\n \n The sighting was near a village that was known as 'Dragon's Green' long before this report was published. Original writing has been kept for authenticity:\n \n \"This serpent is reputed to be nine feete, or rather more, in length, and shaped almost in the form of an axletree of a cart: a quantite of thickness in the middest, and somewhat smaller at both endes. The former part, which he shootes forth as a necke, is supposed to be an elle long (3 ft. 9 inch); with a white ring, as it were, of scales about it. The scales along his back seem to be blackish, and so much as is discovered under his bellie, appeareth to be red . . . it is likewise discovered to have large feete, but the eye may there be deceived, for some suppose that serpents have no feete . . . (The dragon) rids away as fast as a man can run. His food (rabbits) is thought to be, for the most part, in a conie-warren, which he much frequents . . . There are likewise upon either side of him discovered two great bunches so big as a large foote-ball, and (as some thinke) will in time grow to wings, but God, I hope, will (to defend the poor people in the neighbourhood) that he shall be destroyed before he grows to fledge.\"\n \n This dragon was reportedly seen in various places within a circuit of three or four miles, and the pamphlet named some of the still-living witnesses who had seen him. These included as follows: John Steele, Christopher Holder, and a certain \"widow woman dwelling neare Faygate\". Another witness was \"the carrier of Horsham, who lieth at the White Horse (inn) in Southwark\". One of the locals set his two mastiffs onto the monster, and apart from losing his dogs, he was fortunate to escape with his own life, for the dragon was already credited with the deaths of a man and woman at whom it had spat and how consequently had been killed by its venom. When approached unwittingly, our pamphleteer tells us the monster was:\n \n \"...of countenance very proud and at the sight or hearing of men or cattel will raise his neck upright and seem to listen and looke about, with great arrogancy.\"\n \n Fascinating . . . a true eyewitness account of typically reptilian behavior.\n \n Going ahead to the year 1867, less than 200 years ago (2 years after the American Civil War), the monster that lived in the woods around Fittleworth in Sussex was last seen. It would reportedly run up to people hissing and spitting if they happened to stumble across it unawares, although it never harmed anyone. Several such cases could be cited, but suffice it to say that too many incidents like these are reported down through the centuries and from all sorts of locations for us to say that they are all fairy-tales.\n \n VENOMOUS SALIVA?\n \n Let us stop for a moment to consider an interesting and historically repeated fact. Some of these reptilian monsters, as reported here twice, are said to have spit at their enemies. Not only that, their saliva was said to be lethal. Being acquainted with Hollywood, one immediately thinks back upon the blockbuster hit, Jurassic Park, in which a Dilophosaurus spits at and kills a main character. Amazingly, the description given in the 1405 account seems to accurately portray a living Dilophosaurus, as shown right. Again, the animal was \"vast in body, with a crested head, teeth like a saw, and a tail extending to an enormous length.\"\n \n DILOPHOSAURUS\n \n What distinguishes itself the most among these descriptions is the \"crested head.\" The name Dilophosaurus means \"two-crested lizard.\" It was given this name for the two ridges, or crests, of very thin bone, that ran side by side on its head, from behind the eyes to the tip of the nose.\n \n \"Vast in body...\"\n \n The Dilophosaurus could grow to a length of 20 feet (6 meters), and was extremely thick.\n \n \"Teeth like a saw...\"\n \n The Dilophosaurus is notorious in the scientific community for its razor sharp teeth. It also possessed three-fingered hands attached with sharp-claws. From the look of its skeleton, it appeared to be an extremely fierce hunter.\n \n One other note of interest are the crests of this particular dinosaur. The bone is as thin as paper, making it an obviously delicate (and vulnerable) part of its body. A typical question you may find when reading about a Dilophosaurus is, \"Could it have attacked and fought other large dinosaurs without damaging its delicate crest? Or did it prey only on small creatures?\" Believing that a few species of this animal were still alive only a few hundred years ago, the logical conclusion to this question would be the latter question . . . small creatures.\n \n The following is a list of locations throughout Britain where dinosaur activity has been historically reported:\n \n Aller, Somerset; Anwick, Lincolnshire; Bamburgh, Nothumberland; Beckhole, North Yorkshire; Bedd-yr-Afranc, Wales; Ben Vair, Scotland; Bignor Hill, West Sussex; Bishop Auckland, Durham; Bisterne, Hampshire; Brent Pelham, Hertfordshire; Brinsop, Hereford and Worcester; Bures, Suffolk; Cadbury Castle, Devon; Carhampton, Somerset; Castle Carlton, Lincolnshire; Castle Neroche, Somerset; Challacombe, Devon; Churchstanton, Somerset; Cnoc-na-Cnoimh, Scotland; Crowcombe, Somerset; Dalry, Scotland; Deerhurst, Gloucestershire; Dol-y-Carrog, Wales; Dragonhoard, Oxfordshire; Drake Howe, North Yorkshire; Drakelow, Derbyshire; Drakelowe, Worcestershire; Filey Brigg, North Yorkshire; Handale Priory, North Yorkshire; Henham, Essex; Hornden, Essex; Kellington, North Yorkshire; Kilve, Somerset; Kingston St. Mary, Somerset; Lambton Castle, Durham; Linton, Scotland; Little Cornard, Suffolk; Llandeilo Graban, Wales; Llanraeadr-ym-Mochnant, Wales; Llyn Barfog, Wales; Llyn Cynwch, Wales; Llyn Llion, Wales; Llyn-y-Gader, Wales; Llyn-yr-Afanc, Wales; Loch Awe, Scotland; Loch Maree, Scotland; Loch Morar, Scotland; Loch Ness, Scotland; Loch Rannoch, Scotland; Longwitton, Northumberland; Ludham, Norfolk; Lyminster, West Sussex; Manaton, Devon; Money Hill, Northumberland; Moston, Cheshire; Newcastle Emlyn, Wales; Norton Fitzwarren, Hereford and Worcester; Nunnington, North Yorkshire; Old Field Barrows, Shropshire; Penllin Castle, Wales; Penmark, Wales; Penmynydd, Wales; St. Albans, Hertfordshire; St. Leonard's Forest, West Sussex; St. Osyth, Essex; Saffron Waldon, Essex; Sexhow, North Yorkshire; Shervage Wood, Hereford and Worcester; Slingsby, North Yorkshire; Sockburn, Durham; Stinchcombe, Gloucestershire; Strathmartin, Scotland; Walmsgate, Lincolnshire; Wantley, South Yorkshire; Well, North Yorkshire; Wherwell, Hampshire; Whitehorse Hill, Oxfordshire; Winkleigh, Devon; Wiston, Wales; Wormelow Tump, Hereford and Worcester; Wormingford, Essex.\n \n \n -----------------------------------\n FOR US TO SEE...FOR US TO READ\n What Our Ancestors Have Left Behind...\n \n The arguments against dinosaurs existing in recent history become more and more desperate as the truth unfolds. The next weapon the skeptic often unsheathes is a question, unfortunately, many individuals have a hard time answering:\n \n \"What painting, drawings, or carvings do we find of living dinosaurs? Animals of all kinds have been artistically portrayed all throughout history, so why not dinosaurs?\"\n \n Sadly, only ignorance cannot give an ample answer to this question. Take, for instance, the Roman mosaic shown to the right. Dated around the 2nd century A.D., this piece of artwork portrays two large, long-necked animals. No fanciful wings, no multiple heads, no magical, mythical characteristics . . . simply two large creatures that the artist took his time to portray. Trusting that the animals were based upon first-hand experience, and taking into account that the artist deliberately placed them by the sea, it would appear that these were a species of Tanystropheus, an aquatic, webbed dinosaur.[2]\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n We now move on to a phenomenon which occurred almost 40 years ago. Known as the Ica Stones of Peru, they first came to the attention of the scientific community in 1966 when Dr. Javier Cabrera, a local physician, received a small, carved rock for his birthday from a poor native. The carving on the rock looked ancient to Dr. Cabrera, but intrigued him because it seemed to depict a primitive fish. Hearing that the doctor was interested in the stone, local natives began to bring him more, which they collected from a river bank. This soon developed into a vast collection of more than 50,000 stones, many etched with seemingly impossible scenes. Whereas it might be difficult to prove that the fish represented a long-extinct species, as Dr. Cabrera thought, other scenes carved on other stones are not so ambiguous. They clearly depict such dinosaurs as triceratops, stegosaurus, apatosaurus, and human figures riding on the backs of flying pterodactyls. What's more, some of the scenes are of men hunting and killing dinosaurs. Others show men watching the heavens through what look like telescopes, performing open-heart surgery, and cesarean section births.\n \n As many ancient civilizations were more advanced then previously thought, telescopes and performed surgeries should not come as a surprise. However, to see dinosaurs etched on these stones does come as a surprise (to many). Again, in all, more than 50,000 stones discovered, varying in size from that of a baseball to as large as a sofa. As a first thought, the mere large number of them indicates that they are indeed genuine 'relics.' However, more proof is needed, and of that, such proof exists.\n \n The stones themselves are composed of andesite, a very hard mineral that would make etching quite difficult with primitive tools. They are covered with a natural varnish that is created by bacteria over thousands of years. The etching is made by scraping away this dark varnish to reveal the lighter mineral beneath. According to some reports, examinations of the stones show that the grooves of the etchings also bear traces of additional varnish, however, indicating that they are very old.\n \n Ica natives had, in fact, been selling such stones to the tourist trade. Interestingly, the natives of the area can still be seen today making etchings on stones in the style of the Ica Stones to sell to tourists. However, the distinction between their product and the \"genuine\" stones is that the newly etched stones clearly scrape away all of the varnish. In essence, the present-day Ica's cannot make them like the ones found years ago. This, of course, is a very significant fact. \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n At a museum in Manitou Springs, Colorado, exists an artifact on display that has raised more questions than anything else ever discovered in the area; An Indian prayer stick, roughly a foot long, with a crested head, eyes on both sides, and a mouth. When looked upon by anyone acquainted with \"prehistoric reptiles,\" whether it be the common 4-year old to the respected paleontologist, its identity simply cannot, and will not, be ignored. The artistically and well-defined head of a Pterodactyl stands atop the stick, raising many questions of how they molded the head of a species long extinct, and why they did so. Many legends exist of large \"reptilian birds\" in the area, and this, as of now, appears to be the only realistic answer.\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n The portrayal from a Saxon shield discovered years ago reveals the same unmistakable creature. A flying reptile at rest, wings folded along its sides, a long beak, and that full of teeth. Comparison of this with a modern reconstruction of a Pterodactyl or similar animal is most instructive, especially when looking back into Anglo-Saxon history. As late as the beginning of the present century, elderly folk at Penllin in Glamorgan used to tell of a colony of winged serpents that lived in the woods around Penllin Castle. As Marie Trevelyan tells us:\n \n \"The woods around Penllin Castle, Glamorgan, had the reputation of being frequented by winged serpents, and these were the terror of old and young alike. An aged inhabitant of Penllyne, who died a few years ago, said that in his boyhood the winged serpents were described as very beautiful. They were coiled when in repose, and 'looked as if they were covered with jewels of all sorts. Some of them had crests sparkling with all the colours of the rainbow.' When disturbed they glided swiftly, 'sparkling all over', to their hiding places. When angry, they 'flew over people's heads, with outspread wings bright, and sometimes with eyes too, like the feathers in a peacock's tail'. He said it was 'no old story invented to frighten children', but a real fact. His father and uncle had killed some of them, for they were as bad as foxes for poultry. The old man attributed the extinction of the winged serpents to the fact that they were 'terrors in the farmyards and coverts'.\"[3]\n \n This account is intriguing in many respects, not the least being the fact that it is not a typical account of dragons. The creatures concerned were not solitary and monstrous beasts, but small creatures that lived in colonies.\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n A stone can be seen inside the church of SS. Mary and Hardulph at Breedon-on-the-Hill in Leicestershire . . . a stone with very peculiar, graphic engravings; A portrayal from Saxon times of an attack on a herd of long-necked quadrupeds (four-legged) by a bipedal (two-legged) predator. Note the predator's two large legs and puny forelimbs. This portrayal conforms very closley indeed to the description of Grendel, and is a clear indication that such creatures were to be seen on the British mainland as well as the Continent, as is also shown by Athelstan's and other charters.[3]\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n In 1902, a group of scientists and workmen dug up part of the wall of a 2,500-year-old city. On that wall was a mystery.\n \n The city was Babylon, which once stood on the banks of the Euphrates River in the Near East, in what is now the nation of Iraq. Babylon was once the capital of the kingdom of Babylonia, one of the world's greatest cities. It was a huge square of houses, temples, and palaces, surrounded by a high wall made of shiny, colored bricks. What scientists discovered and dug up was a part of the wall with a gateway. The gateway was decorated with sculptors of three kinds of animals, arranged in rows. One animal was a lion, while another was a bull. The third, however, was a strange creature such as none of the scientists had ever seen before.\n \n The creature had a scaly body with a long tail and a long snakelike neck. A forked tongue, like the tongue of a snake, stuck out its mouth, and a long horn stuck up from its forehead. Its front legs looked much like the legs and feet of a cat. However, it had scaly back legs, along with clawed feet. Whatever animal this thing was, the portrayer certainly made it clear that it was a reptile. Interestingly, the artists had shown the muscles and skin and hair of the lion and bull so well that those animals looked almost real. And what they showed of this creature, too, looked almost real.\n \n Surprising though it seems, even though the scientists had never seen this creature before, they knew what it was supposed to be, for the king, that is, King Nebuchadnezzar, had left writings that described the decoration. The writings, found and translated, revealed that Nebuchadnezzar had called the creature a Sirrush, which was the Babylonian word for Dragon.[4]\n \n In some versions of the Bible, contained in the last few chapters of Daniel, the Sirrush is made mention of. In fact, it is the subject of a controversial situation. The Sirrush, or dragon, was kept in a temple in Babylon during the days of Nebuchadnezzar. This creature was worshipped as a god, and according to the story, the Hebrew prophet Daniel proved that the creature was not a god by feeding it poisoned food, which eventually killed it.\n \n Whether or not we today regard the Sirrush as a living, breathing animal, King Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians did, and it perhaps would be wise for us to give them the benefit of the doubt.\n \n Much more could be written about dinosaurs throughout the history of mankind, and such will be written. For now, consider not only the possibility of dinosaurs alongside man, but moreso, the distinct probability. \n \n And this one in red is particularly interesting to me.",

The carving on the rock looked ancient to Dr. Cabrera, but intrigued him because it seemed to depict a primitive fish. Hearing that the doctor was interested in the stone, local natives began to bring him more, which they collected from a river bank. This soon developed into a vast collection of more than 50,000 stones, many etched with seemingly impossible scenes. Whereas it might be difficult to prove that the fish represented a long-extinct species, as Dr. Cabrera thought, other scenes carved on other stones are not so ambiguous. They clearly depict such dinosaurs as triceratops, stegosaurus, apatosaurus, and human figures riding on the backs of flying pterodactyls. What's more, some of the scenes are of men hunting and killing dinosaurs. Others show men watching the heavens through what look like telescopes, performing open-heart surgery, and cesarean section births.\n \n\n \n Are you denying you posted this?

   "How do you know you schmuck?\n\n \n I have a decent understanding of anatomy, along with weights, not to mention a bit of background in biology. Sarupods are basically see-saws. The neck and tail are counterbalances to each other. Think about it. If the neck was like that, the tail would result in a massive amount of disportionate weight. The organism would litterally fall on its tail as no counterbalance would prevent this. This is basic engineering. They teach counter balances in 4th grade at my highschool. Putting too much weight on one side results in a tipping over on that side. This isn't very hard to figure out. Most modern skyscrappers in earthquake zone areas have massive counter balances. Wonder why? Because when a earthquake hits, the counter balance shifts the other way to result in stabilization of the building. If no counter balance was there, the entire weight would shift one way, likely resulting in disaster. Sarupods differ merely that they top out at maybe 30 feet tall, not 1/4 of a mile. \n \n \nHave you lived with that type of animal or ever seen a living one?\n\n \n Irrelevant. Understanding the engineering is all one requires. Have you seen a hydroeletric dam? Under your logic, you can't understand it if you have not seen one. That's utterly foolish.

Unlike you. \n \n \nThen explain how a 747 wide body flies then. Its wings dont even flap like a birds or dragons.\n\n \n Jet propulsion forces air underneath the rigid wing to create lift. A dragon has no such proplusion method. Very few birds actually rely upon beating their wings to fly. There's also a reason why most birds are small and light with hollow bones. They cannot support the necessary muscle to rely upon beating wings to create lift. It's called a thermo, rising heat provides lift, which birds use to fly. \n \n \nHave you considered that the wings might be sized in proportion to its mass?\n\n \n That would require a wing of massive proportions, easily dwarfing the body of the animal. This create a bunch of serious problems. Such wing area would result in a rapid loss of heat. The animal would litterally need to sit in the sun for hours just to be able to walk around and not die, caves are out of the question.. Not to mention that such large wings create ample opportunity for damage, resulting in loss of flight, especially for the young. Furthermore, such wings would require a exponential increase in wing muscle merely to control them. The larger the wings get the more muscle you need to power them. Theres a reason why some of the best fliers are the smallest. With such increasing amounts of muscle and heat loss the food requirements would skyrocket. And let's remember that all birds that have large wings rely heavily upon thermos to keep them aloft. I'm not sure even the largest thermo could keep a several ton animal in the sky assuming it could even get there in the first place. Just because you are ignorant of most things does not make those who are not ignorant wrong. Flight is a extremely expensive caloric engagement for organisms. In places where the risk of being eaten is low, species lose their ability to fly to concentrate on less expensive modes of travel and escape (australia). \n \n \nWhy is your ability to reason so limited?\n\n \n Whoa there gulliable tourists. You're calling my ability to understand flight, muscles and their interactions along with thermos to be LIMITED when you can't even understand the basics? \n \n Explain to me how having alot of knowledge is bad and having virtually none is good. \n \n \nLook, wallow in your mockery and ignorance child.\n\n \n There you have it kiddies. \n \n Arch is saying having a education is a bad thing and being beyond ignorance is a good thing!

How could such reverential, awe-inspiring creatures of man's simple imagination have such an impact upon almost every civilization of the past? Could it be, just perhaps, that what countless numbers of people have written about through the course of time could have been actual, living animals? To some this seems absurd, but when all the facts and truths are put together, much more than myth and legend are revealed.\n \n \n Introduction\n \n To test this assertion, we will now examine the issue by considering the written evidence that has survived from the records of various ancient peoples that describe, sometimes in most graphic detail, human encounters with living giant reptiles that we today would call dinosaurs. And as we shall see, some of those records are not so ancient.\n \n First, however, let's briefly look at the common \"dragon knowledge\" we read from our history books. The ancient Norsemen adorned the prows of their vessels with carved likenesses of dragons. Among the Celtic conquerors of Britain the dragon was a symbol of sovereignty. Dragons were also depicted on the shields of the Teutonic tribes that later invaded Britain, and it appeared on the battle standards of the English kings as late as the 16th century. Beginning in the early 20th century, it was inscribed on the armorial bearings of the Prince of Wales.\n \n The dragon also figures in the mythology of various Oriental countries, notably Japan and China. It is deified in the Daoist (Taoist) religion and was the national emblem of the Chinese Empire. Among the Chinese people, the dragon is traditionally regarded as a symbol of good fortune.[1]\n \n More than myths and legends, however, we find a numerous amount of accurate historical accounts of \"dinosaur-like\" dragons from all around the world.\n \n Following from source [2]\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n FRANCE\n \n The city of Nerluc was renamed in honor of the killing of a \"dragon\" there. This animal was bigger than an ox and had long, sharp, pointed horns on its head. There were a number of different horned dinosaurs. The Triceratops is one example.\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n ITALY\n \n A scientist named Ulysses Aldrovandus carefully described a small \"dragon\" seen along a farm road in northern Italy. The date was May 13, 1572. The poor, rare creature was so small that a farmer killed it just by knocking it on the head with his walking stick.\n \n The animal had done nothing wrong but hiss at the farmer's oxen as they approached it on the road. The scientist got the dead body and made measurements and a drawing. He even had the animal mounted for a museum. It had a long neck, a very long tail and a fat body.\n \n The skeletons of a number of ancient reptile-like creatures match this basic description.\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n CHINA\n \n Thousands of dragon stories and pictures can be found in ancient Chinese books and art. One interesting legend tells about a famous Chinese man named Yu. After the great world flood, Yu surveyed the land of China and divided it into sections. He \"built channels to drain the water off to the sea\" and helped make the land livable again. Many snakes and \"dragons\" were driven from the marshlands when Yu created the new farmlands.\n \n Ancient Chinese books even tell of a family that kept \"dragons\" and raised babies. It is said that in those days, Chinese kings used \"dragons\" for pulling royal chariots on special occasions, a fact of which famous explorer Marco Polo himself attested to.\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Summary\n \n Over the years of time, truth can often become distorted; events are exaggerated, facts are made more exciting. This, we believe, is the case with dinosaurs and dragons. Today we think of them as magical, mystical, fictitious beings, but as any historian will tell you, almost all legends and myths are based on true, actual facts and events. A fire-breathing dragon? Is it possible? Scientists still are puzzled by hollow naval cavities found in the skulls of many dinosaur specimens found today. They seem to serve no purpose. Or did they?\n \n Delve into this exciting topic. We ask the skeptic to read, observe the evidence, and keep an open mind. History, we hope, will never be the same.\n \n \n -----------------------------------\n DINOSAUR EXTINCTION\n Putting Two and Two Together...\n \n If one was to conduct a questionnaire, a questionnaire putting forth one simple question, given to people of average intelligence, a result would entail revealing an astounding \"hidden knowledge\" inherent in us human beings. It would be as follows:\n \n \"What historical animal, real or fictitious, do we have more stories about being killed because of its threat to people?\"\n \n It might take a brief minute of thinking, but the majority would unquestionably reply \"A dragon.\" Why? Why do we have so many legends, accounts, and fire-side tales of these large, ferocious, reptilian creatures? . . . and why, to step further, are they all acquainted with death? Why is there always a knight, noble, king, or peasant, sent by the people to slay the dragon? And why, we must honestly ask ourselves, do dragons possess so many similarities to what we today know as dinosaurs?\n \n Let us begin with the first question. As every historian will tell you, historical legends are all based on some amount of fact, i.e. King Arthur, Robin Hood, Gilgamesh, etc. More then just your common stories, legends do in fact open the door in allowing us to, in a sense, go back in time. We can ponder the truths given in the legend of St. George and his encounter with a reptilian animal. While some dragon legends possess exaggerations, magic and marvelous deeds, the account of St. George is free from any of this.\n \n However, when one finds actual accounts, accounts written as if one was writing about an encounter with a lion or bear of today, the notion that dinosaurs were only animals of \"pre-historic times\" becomes absurd.\n \n \n DINOSAURS IN HISTORY\n British Isles - Anglo-Saxon Records [3]\n \n One account takes us back to the days of the early Britons, from whom the modern Welsh are descended. They provide us with our earliest surviving European accounts of reptilian monsters, one of whom killed and devoured King Morvidus in 336 B.C. We are told in the amazing account, translated for us by Geoffrey of Monmouth, that the monster \"gulped down the body of Morvidus as a big fish swallows a little one.\" Geoffrey himself described the animal as a Belua. The Belua was described as reptilian, and when we endeavor to compare it with any other animal of today, coupled with the fact that it gulped down Morvidus \"as a big fish swallows a little one,\" we find it difficult in doing so. No land animal of today, let alone reptilian, could devour a human by such standards. Therefore, Geoffrey was either a flat out liar, or he told the truth.\n \n In the British Isles alone there are approximately 200 locations in which dinosaur activity has been reported. Going into the future to the year 1405, we now visit Bures in Soffolk, where a chronicle reveals to us the physical reality of yet another dinosaur:\n \n \"Close to the town of Bures, near Sudbury, there has lately appeared, to the great hurt of the countryside, a dragon, vast in body, with a crested head, teeth like a saw, and a tail extending to an enormous length. Having slaughtered the shepherd of a flock, it devoured many sheep.\"\n \n After an unsuccessful attempt by local archers to kill the beast, due to its impenetrable hide:\n \n \"...in order to destroy him, all the country people around were summoned. But when the dragon saw that he was again to be assailed with arrows, he fled into a marsh or mere and there hid himself among the long reeds, and was no more seen.\"\n \n As you continue to read, you may perhaps think to yourself, \"Why aren't these chronicles from history more well known? Why have I not heard or read about these things before?\" Sadly, most historians throw aside these accounts, simply because the word \"dragon\" is used. As the term \"dinosaur\" wasn't invented until the 1800s, to do so is foolish and a detriment to history itself.\n \n In the 15th century, according to a contemporary chronicle that still survives in Canterbury Cathedral's library, the following incident was reported. On the afternoon of Friday, September 26, 1449, two giant reptiles were seen fighting on the banks of the River Stour (near the village of Little Cornard) which marked the English county borders of Suffolk and Essex. One was black, and the other \"reddish and spotted\". After an hour-long struggle that took place \"to the admiration of many beholding them\", the black monster yielded and returned to its lair, the scene of the conflict being known ever since as Sharpfight Meadow.\n \n As late as August, 1614, the following sober account was given of a strange reptile that was encountered in St. Leonard's Forest in Sussex.\n \n The sighting was near a village that was known as 'Dragon's Green' long before this report was published. Original writing has been kept for authenticity:\n \n \"This serpent is reputed to be nine feete, or rather more, in length, and shaped almost in the form of an axletree of a cart: a quantite of thickness in the middest, and somewhat smaller at both endes. The former part, which he shootes forth as a necke, is supposed to be an elle long (3 ft. 9 inch); with a white ring, as it were, of scales about it. The scales along his back seem to be blackish, and so much as is discovered under his bellie, appeareth to be red . . . it is likewise discovered to have large feete, but the eye may there be deceived, for some suppose that serpents have no feete . . . (The dragon) rids away as fast as a man can run. His food (rabbits) is thought to be, for the most part, in a conie-warren, which he much frequents . . . There are likewise upon either side of him discovered two great bunches so big as a large foote-ball, and (as some thinke) will in time grow to wings, but God, I hope, will (to defend the poor people in the neighbourhood) that he shall be destroyed before he grows to fledge.\"\n \n This dragon was reportedly seen in various places within a circuit of three or four miles, and the pamphlet named some of the still-living witnesses who had seen him. These included as follows: John Steele, Christopher Holder, and a certain \"widow woman dwelling neare Faygate\". Another witness was \"the carrier of Horsham, who lieth at the White Horse (inn) in Southwark\". One of the locals set his two mastiffs onto the monster, and apart from losing his dogs, he was fortunate to escape with his own life, for the dragon was already credited with the deaths of a man and woman at whom it had spat and how consequently had been killed by its venom. When approached unwittingly, our pamphleteer tells us the monster was:\n \n \"...of countenance very proud and at the sight or hearing of men or cattel will raise his neck upright and seem to listen and looke about, with great arrogancy.\"\n \n Fascinating . . . a true eyewitness account of typically reptilian behavior.\n \n Going ahead to the year 1867, less than 200 years ago (2 years after the American Civil War), the monster that lived in the woods around Fittleworth in Sussex was last seen. It would reportedly run up to people hissing and spitting if they happened to stumble across it unawares, although it never harmed anyone. Several such cases could be cited, but suffice it to say that too many incidents like these are reported down through the centuries and from all sorts of locations for us to say that they are all fairy-tales.\n \n VENOMOUS SALIVA?\n \n Let us stop for a moment to consider an interesting and historically repeated fact. Some of these reptilian monsters, as reported here twice, are said to have spit at their enemies. Not only that, their saliva was said to be lethal. Being acquainted with Hollywood, one immediately thinks back upon the blockbuster hit, Jurassic Park, in which a Dilophosaurus spits at and kills a main character. Amazingly, the description given in the 1405 account seems to accurately portray a living Dilophosaurus, as shown right. Again, the animal was \"vast in body, with a crested head, teeth like a saw, and a tail extending to an enormous length.\"\n \n DILOPHOSAURUS\n \n What distinguishes itself the most among these descriptions is the \"crested head.\" The name Dilophosaurus means \"two-crested lizard.\" It was given this name for the two ridges, or crests, of very thin bone, that ran side by side on its head, from behind the eyes to the tip of the nose.\n \n \"Vast in body...\"\n \n The Dilophosaurus could grow to a length of 20 feet (6 meters), and was extremely thick.\n \n \"Teeth like a saw...\"\n \n The Dilophosaurus is notorious in the scientific community for its razor sharp teeth. It also possessed three-fingered hands attached with sharp-claws. From the look of its skeleton, it appeared to be an extremely fierce hunter.\n \n One other note of interest are the crests of this particular dinosaur. The bone is as thin as paper, making it an obviously delicate (and vulnerable) part of its body. A typical question you may find when reading about a Dilophosaurus is, \"Could it have attacked and fought other large dinosaurs without damaging its delicate crest? Or did it prey only on small creatures?\" Believing that a few species of this animal were still alive only a few hundred years ago, the logical conclusion to this question would be the latter question . . . small creatures.\n \n The following is a list of locations throughout Britain where dinosaur activity has been historically reported:\n \n Aller, Somerset; Anwick, Lincolnshire; Bamburgh, Nothumberland; Beckhole, North Yorkshire; Bedd-yr-Afranc, Wales; Ben Vair, Scotland; Bignor Hill, West Sussex; Bishop Auckland, Durham; Bisterne, Hampshire; Brent Pelham, Hertfordshire; Brinsop, Hereford and Worcester; Bures, Suffolk; Cadbury Castle, Devon; Carhampton, Somerset; Castle Carlton, Lincolnshire; Castle Neroche, Somerset; Challacombe, Devon; Churchstanton, Somerset; Cnoc-na-Cnoimh, Scotland; Crowcombe, Somerset; Dalry, Scotland; Deerhurst, Gloucestershire; Dol-y-Carrog, Wales; Dragonhoard, Oxfordshire; Drake Howe, North Yorkshire; Drakelow, Derbyshire; Drakelowe, Worcestershire; Filey Brigg, North Yorkshire; Handale Priory, North Yorkshire; Henham, Essex; Hornden, Essex; Kellington, North Yorkshire; Kilve, Somerset; Kingston St. Mary, Somerset; Lambton Castle, Durham; Linton, Scotland; Little Cornard, Suffolk; Llandeilo Graban, Wales; Llanraeadr-ym-Mochnant, Wales; Llyn Barfog, Wales; Llyn Cynwch, Wales; Llyn Llion, Wales; Llyn-y-Gader, Wales; Llyn-yr-Afanc, Wales; Loch Awe, Scotland; Loch Maree, Scotland; Loch Morar, Scotland; Loch Ness, Scotland; Loch Rannoch, Scotland; Longwitton, Northumberland; Ludham, Norfolk; Lyminster, West Sussex; Manaton, Devon; Money Hill, Northumberland; Moston, Cheshire; Newcastle Emlyn, Wales; Norton Fitzwarren, Hereford and Worcester; Nunnington, North Yorkshire; Old Field Barrows, Shropshire; Penllin Castle, Wales; Penmark, Wales; Penmynydd, Wales; St. Albans, Hertfordshire; St. Leonard's Forest, West Sussex; St. Osyth, Essex; Saffron Waldon, Essex; Sexhow, North Yorkshire; Shervage Wood, Hereford and Worcester; Slingsby, North Yorkshire; Sockburn, Durham; Stinchcombe, Gloucestershire; Strathmartin, Scotland; Walmsgate, Lincolnshire; Wantley, South Yorkshire; Well, North Yorkshire; Wherwell, Hampshire; Whitehorse Hill, Oxfordshire; Winkleigh, Devon; Wiston, Wales; Wormelow Tump, Hereford and Worcester; Wormingford, Essex.\n \n \n -----------------------------------\n FOR US TO SEE...FOR US TO READ\n What Our Ancestors Have Left Behind...\n \n The arguments against dinosaurs existing in recent history become more and more desperate as the truth unfolds. The next weapon the skeptic often unsheathes is a question, unfortunately, many individuals have a hard time answering:\n \n \"What painting, drawings, or carvings do we find of living dinosaurs? Animals of all kinds have been artistically portrayed all throughout history, so why not dinosaurs?\"\n \n Sadly, only ignorance cannot give an ample answer to this question. Take, for instance, the Roman mosaic shown to the right. Dated around the 2nd century A.D., this piece of artwork portrays two large, long-necked animals. No fanciful wings, no multiple heads, no magical, mythical characteristics . . . simply two large creatures that the artist took his time to portray. Trusting that the animals were based upon first-hand experience, and taking into account that the artist deliberately placed them by the sea, it would appear that these were a species of Tanystropheus, an aquatic, webbed dinosaur.[2]\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n We now move on to a phenomenon which occurred almost 40 years ago. Known as the Ica Stones of Peru, they first came to the attention of the scientific community in 1966 when Dr. Javier Cabrera, a local physician, received a small, carved rock for his birthday from a poor native. The carving on the rock looked ancient to Dr. Cabrera, but intrigued him because it seemed to depict a primitive fish. Hearing that the doctor was interested in the stone, local natives began to bring him more, which they collected from a river bank. This soon developed into a vast collection of more than 50,000 stones, many etched with seemingly impossible scenes. Whereas it might be difficult to prove that the fish represented a long-extinct species, as Dr. Cabrera thought, other scenes carved on other stones are not so ambiguous. They clearly depict such dinosaurs as triceratops, stegosaurus, apatosaurus, and human figures riding on the backs of flying pterodactyls. What's more, some of the scenes are of men hunting and killing dinosaurs. Others show men watching the heavens through what look like telescopes, performing open-heart surgery, and cesarean section births.\n \n As many ancient civilizations were more advanced then previously thought, telescopes and performed surgeries should not come as a surprise. However, to see dinosaurs etched on these stones does come as a surprise (to many). Again, in all, more than 50,000 stones discovered, varying in size from that of a baseball to as large as a sofa. As a first thought, the mere large number of them indicates that they are indeed genuine 'relics.' However, more proof is needed, and of that, such proof exists.\n \n The stones themselves are composed of andesite, a very hard mineral that would make etching quite difficult with primitive tools. They are covered with a natural varnish that is created by bacteria over thousands of years. The etching is made by scraping away this dark varnish to reveal the lighter mineral beneath. According to some reports, examinations of the stones show that the grooves of the etchings also bear traces of additional varnish, however, indicating that they are very old.\n \n Ica natives had, in fact, been selling such stones to the tourist trade. Interestingly, the natives of the area can still be seen today making etchings on stones in the style of the Ica Stones to sell to tourists. However, the distinction between their product and the \"genuine\" stones is that the newly etched stones clearly scrape away all of the varnish. In essence, the present-day Ica's cannot make them like the ones found years ago. This, of course, is a very significant fact. \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n At a museum in Manitou Springs, Colorado, exists an artifact on display that has raised more questions than anything else ever discovered in the area; An Indian prayer stick, roughly a foot long, with a crested head, eyes on both sides, and a mouth. When looked upon by anyone acquainted with \"prehistoric reptiles,\" whether it be the common 4-year old to the respected paleontologist, its identity simply cannot, and will not, be ignored. The artistically and well-defined head of a Pterodactyl stands atop the stick, raising many questions of how they molded the head of a species long extinct, and why they did so. Many legends exist of large \"reptilian birds\" in the area, and this, as of now, appears to be the only realistic answer.\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n The portrayal from a Saxon shield discovered years ago reveals the same unmistakable creature. A flying reptile at rest, wings folded along its sides, a long beak, and that full of teeth. Comparison of this with a modern reconstruction of a Pterodactyl or similar animal is most instructive, especially when looking back into Anglo-Saxon history. As late as the beginning of the present century, elderly folk at Penllin in Glamorgan used to tell of a colony of winged serpents that lived in the woods around Penllin Castle. As Marie Trevelyan tells us:\n \n \"The woods around Penllin Castle, Glamorgan, had the reputation of being frequented by winged serpents, and these were the terror of old and young alike. An aged inhabitant of Penllyne, who died a few years ago, said that in his boyhood the winged serpents were described as very beautiful. They were coiled when in repose, and 'looked as if they were covered with jewels of all sorts. Some of them had crests sparkling with all the colours of the rainbow.' When disturbed they glided swiftly, 'sparkling all over', to their hiding places. When angry, they 'flew over people's heads, with outspread wings bright, and sometimes with eyes too, like the feathers in a peacock's tail'. He said it was 'no old story invented to frighten children', but a real fact. His father and uncle had killed some of them, for they were as bad as foxes for poultry. The old man attributed the extinction of the winged serpents to the fact that they were 'terrors in the farmyards and coverts'.\"[3]\n \n This account is intriguing in many respects, not the least being the fact that it is not a typical account of dragons. The creatures concerned were not solitary and monstrous beasts, but small creatures that lived in colonies.\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n A stone can be seen inside the church of SS. Mary and Hardulph at Breedon-on-the-Hill in Leicestershire . . . a stone with very peculiar, graphic engravings; A portrayal from Saxon times of an attack on a herd of long-necked quadrupeds (four-legged) by a bipedal (two-legged) predator. Note the predator's two large legs and puny forelimbs. This portrayal conforms very closley indeed to the description of Grendel, and is a clear indication that such creatures were to be seen on the British mainland as well as the Continent, as is also shown by Athelstan's and other charters.[3]\n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n In 1902, a group of scientists and workmen dug up part of the wall of a 2,500-year-old city. On that wall was a mystery.\n \n The city was Babylon, which once stood on the banks of the Euphrates River in the Near East, in what is now the nation of Iraq. Babylon was once the capital of the kingdom of Babylonia, one of the world's greatest cities. It was a huge square of houses, temples, and palaces, surrounded by a high wall made of shiny, colored bricks. What scientists discovered and dug up was a part of the wall with a gateway. The gateway was decorated with sculptors of three kinds of animals, arranged in rows. One animal was a lion, while another was a bull. The third, however, was a strange creature such as none of the scientists had ever seen before.\n \n The creature had a scaly body with a long tail and a long snakelike neck. A forked tongue, like the tongue of a snake, stuck out its mouth, and a long horn stuck up from its forehead. Its front legs looked much like the legs and feet of a cat. However, it had scaly back legs, along with clawed feet. Whatever animal this thing was, the portrayer certainly made it clear that it was a reptile. Interestingly, the artists had shown the muscles and skin and hair of the lion and bull so well that those animals looked almost real. And what they showed of this creature, too, looked almost real.\n \n Surprising though it seems, even though the scientists had never seen this creature before, they knew what it was supposed to be, for the king, that is, King Nebuchadnezzar, had left writings that described the decoration. The writings, found and translated, revealed that Nebuchadnezzar had called the creature a Sirrush, which was the Babylonian word for Dragon.[4]\n \n In some versions of the Bible, contained in the last few chapters of Daniel, the Sirrush is made mention of. In fact, it is the subject of a controversial situation. The Sirrush, or dragon, was kept in a temple in Babylon during the days of Nebuchadnezzar. This creature was worshipped as a god, and according to the story, the Hebrew prophet Daniel proved that the creature was not a god by feeding it poisoned food, which eventually killed it.\n \n Whether or not we today regard the Sirrush as a living, breathing animal, King Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians did, and it perhaps would be wise for us to give them the benefit of the doubt.\n \n Much more could be written about dinosaurs throughout the history of mankind, and such will be written. For now, consider not only the possibility of dinosaurs alongside man, but moreso, the distinct probability. \n \n And this one in red is particularly interesting to me.\n\n \n \n:xbanghead :xbanghead :xbanghead So, you don't even read what you post.

   "With only a little knowledge you would understand why your question is so silly. Since the wings of an airplane have only the function of providing lift, they don't need to flap them. Since birds don't have jets blowing out their hind end, they need to flap their wings. Also, I guess you don't know that the shape of the wing is related to function as well as mass, or that much of the body weight of a bird is taken up with the muscles required to flap it's wings.\n\n \n Like we've all said, Arch can't be bothered by things such as facts.

Bumble bee flight is pretty simple really. It involves dynamic stalling. Essentially the way the bee's wings work is to produce a vortex that produced sufficent lift. Not all that complicated really as the basic concept allows helicopters to fly. \n \n \nThe greatest minds in the field can't figure that one out.\n\n \n No, the calcuations did not take into the effects of dyanmic stall.

   "No kidding sherlock. When did I compare any animal to fixed wing aircraft ? It was child who made the comparison.\nHow quickly you forget. You began the discussion about bumblebees with that implied comparison. The problem seems to be that you lack the understanding to realize that. You said:\nWell riddle me this schmuck, how does a bumble bee fly ? The greatest minds in the field can't figure that one out... Scientifically it's proven to be impossible so it must be a figment of our imagination right ?\nMy response to your claim was, in effect, that it didn't even take the greatest minds in the field to figure it out and that it had not been \"scientifically proven\" to be impossible. The problem is that once again you sucker for the myth and reject reality. That reality is that bees don't have fixed wings, the calculations that you are using.\n \nThe only point I was making which is of course beyond Child to comprehend is that the Bumble Bee isn't supposed to fly according to the known dynamics of flight.\nIt is apparently beyond your ability to comprehend that obvious_child and I were pointing out that you are dead wrong. How a bumblebee flies is quite well understood according to the known dynamics of flight. As I pointed out before, you fall for the myth and the hoax without bothering to educate yourself as to the facts.\n \n If you check with Wikipedia you will find that they say exactly what obvious_child and I told you.\n \nIt is believed that the calculations which purported to show that bumblebees cannot fly are based upon a simplified linear treatment of oscillating aerofoils. The method assumes small amplitude oscillations without flow separation. This ignores the effect of dynamic stall, an airflow separation inducing a large vortex above the wing, which briefly produces several times the lift of the aerofoil in regular flight. More sophisticated aerodynamic analysis shows that the bumblebee can fly because its wings encounter dynamic stall in every oscillation cycle.\n\n \nSadly, that concept is beyond him as he gives the scientific definition of the process without appreciating that if Bumble bees understood the laws of thermo dynamics as we do, they would never even attempt to fly.\nSadly, there seem to be two concepts that are completely beyond you. The first is that obvious_child has already pointed out that it is you who fails to understand that according to the laws of aerodynamics there is no problem with bumblebee flight. The second is that thermodynamics is not a consideration as far as I know. Maybe you would explain to all of us limited thinkers exactly how heat transfer is meaningful in the calculation of lift produced by an airfoil. Or maybe you just don't even understand the meaning of the word \"thermodynamics.\"\n \n By the way, your rampant antisemitism made evident by your constant attempts to insult with Yiddish is noted. Second, I also note that you are unaware that a question mark at the end of a sentence should not be preceded by a space. That space marks you as semi-literate and grossly undereducated.",
