The inmate, Jeffrey Lundgren, 56, died by injection at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville. He was convicted of killing Dennis Avery, 49, his wife, Cheryl Avery, 41, and their children, Trina, 15, Rebecca, 13, and Karen, 7. Upset by what he saw as a lack of faith, Mr. Lundgren arranged a dinner hosted by cult members. Afterward, he and his followers led the family members one by one to their deaths while the others unknowingly cleaned up after dinner.",

Too many of them were gulled by the idea that they should be loyal to the President of the United States, especially after the events of September 11, 2001 and they went along with Bush on invading Iraq. Now, if you would indicate which torture bill you are referring to I could give you a list of Democrats who didn't vote for that bill.\n \n- Where were the Democrats when Habeas Corpus was suspended in the US?\nSenate Bill 3930 Democratic Senators who voted against: Akaka (D-HI); Baucus (D-MT); Bayh (D-IN); Biden (D-DE); Bingaman (D-NM); Boxer (D-CA); Byrd (D-WV); Cantwell (D-WA); Chafee (R-RI); Clinton (D-NY); Conrad (D-ND); Dayton (D-MN).

After a bunch of us went to him and held his feet to the fire, he voted against Patriot Act II. He is also up for re-election this year but he's in a safe seat so he could also vote against suspension of Habeas Corpus.\n \n The Democrats are outnumbered. They can't mount a filibuster because they don't have enough votes to reject a cloture of a filibuster.\n \n If we are able to elect a Democratic House of Representatives and a Democratic Senate in 2006, we can start to demand accountability from the executive branch of the United State government.\n \n Also, a lot of Americans are poorly educated and easily brainwashed by the likes of Rump Limpballs and his ilk.

Al Casciato said. He said two groups of people had gotten into an altercation before the shooting began.\n \n One victim was listed in critical condition at San Francisco General Hospital.\n \n The once-spontaneous and unsanctioned party was taken over by the city four years ago after police recorded five stabbings and a number of assaults in a 2002 crowd of 500,000 people and confiscated a chain saw.\n \n Officials and members of the district's large gay community said the party had started attracting gay bashers along with the usual colorfully costumed characters.\n \n On Tuesday night, city officials ramped up the police presence, reduced the number of entertainment stages from three to one and cut off the festivities at 11 p.m.\n \n \"We had the sheriff's department screening people for weapons and alcohol. Obviously you have a major event - a lot of different spots\" to patrol, said police spokesman Neville Gittens said. \"I can't explain how this happened. Unfortunately it did happen, and we are investigating to find out who is the cause of the shooting.\"\n \n Ted Morales, 43, said he was working as a volunteer security guard for the event when he \"heard someone empty their gun\" in the crowd.\n \n \"When the shooting happened, people just dove to the ground like a wall of water,\" said Morales, who did not see what led up to the shooting. A woman standing near him was grazed in the neck by a bullet, he said.\n \n Sophia Vlahiotis, who owns Capri Ristorante Pizza just yards from the scene, was outside selling pizzas when a crowd of people fleeing the bullets began running in her direction.\n \n \"They pushed the table over, the oven fell and then I realized it was gunshots,\" she said. \"They were trying to get into the restaurant, there were so many people.\"\n \n Vlahiotis, who did not see what led up to the shooting, said this year may be her last participating in the Halloween party.\n \n \"I'm still shaking,\" she said. \"I don't know if I want to do this again. It's not worth my life.\"\n \n In another Halloween shooting, a gunman opened fire in a crowded Southern California bar early Wednesday, wounding two people, police said. The apparent target of the shooting was hit several times in the chest and legs, and a woman was shot in the buttocks, West Covina Police Lt. Pete Mena said. Mena said the injuries did not appear to be life-threatening.\n \n In Tennessee, an unarmed security officer patrolling a Knoxville high school to prevent Halloween vandalism was shot to death Tuesday night. A man who Knox County Sheriff Tim Hutchison said had described himself as homeless and from Virginia was in custody after taking the officer's cruiser and lead police on a chase.\n \n \u00a9 2006 The Associated Press.

Brooks is about to become the darling of the religious right in America -- and it's making him nervous. \n \n The child of academics, raised in a liberal household and educated in the liberal arts, Brooks has written a book that concludes religious conservatives donate far more money than secular liberals to all sorts of charitable activities, irrespective of income. \n \n In the book, he cites extensive data analysis to demonstrate that values advocated by conservatives -- from church attendance and two-parent families to the Protestant work ethic and a distaste for government-funded social services -- make conservatives more generous than liberals. \n \n The book, titled \"Who Really Cares: The Surprising Truth About Compassionate Conservatism\" (Basic Books, $26), is due for release Nov. 24. \n \n",

   "This guy is a liar. He is not a liberal. He's a conservative wolf in liberal sheep's clothing, to make a bad metaphor.\n \n EF, you forgot to include a very important little sentence:\n\n \n I just copied the first few lines. I did not cherry pick anything. I thought you amongst others could read the entire article on their own. But, since YOU chose to cherry pick, then let us put that in context for everyone here:\n \n \nHarvey Mansfield, professor of government at Harvard University and 2004 recipient of the National Humanities Medal, does not know Brooks personally but has read the book. \n \n \"His main finding is quite startling, that the people who talk the most about caring actually fork over the least,\" he said. \"But beyond this finding I thought his analysis was extremely good, especially for an economist. He thinks very well about the reason for this and reflects about politics and morals in a way most economists do their best to avoid.\" \n \n Brooks says he started the book as an academic treatise, then tightened the documentation and punched up the prose when his colleagues and editor convinced him it would sell better and generate more discussion if he did. \n \n To make his point forcefully, Brooks admits he cut out a lot of qualifying information. \n \n \"I know I'm going to get yelled at a lot with this book,\" he said. \"But when you say something big and new, you're going to get yelled at.\" \n \n\n \n You calling him a liar with no support is illogical. He declares in the article that he is an independent. This other Harvard Professor declares his conclusions good. He has far more support even without the \"qualifiers\". \n \n Surprised you missed that.emoticon_cool",
