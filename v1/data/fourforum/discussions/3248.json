Because frankly, I'm not sure that it isn't.\nYou are overlooking some mathematical facts and assuming that all ME Muslims are prone to terrorism. I believe this not to be the case. For every terrorist oriented person there are likely thousands who prefer to live peacefully.\n \n I do not recall restricting the killing of terrorists to the ME. It should be a global tactic. Kill them ALL! This includes Tim McVeigh, Terry Nichols, Eric Robert Rudolf , etc. ad infinitum.\n \n Even if the execution of one terrorist produces two more from the pool of potential terrorist, it will not reduce the number of peacelovers. Kill those two and the four that follow them and the eight that follow them...eventually you'll get them all and have only peacelovers left (the current population minus the number of them that the terrorists kill in the mean time).\n \n This is not genocide. It is not directed toward any one ethnic group, but at KNOWN TERRORISTS regardless of their origin. This is good housekeeping. Eventually, the world would have few or no terrorists. Kill them all. (The terrorists and those who support them.)\n \n I did, at one time suggest that we inform the terrorists world that we will kill their entire families in return for an act of terrorism. This is a bit drastic and I retract that stance. There are likely many peacelovers who have terrorists in their families. Besides, a threat to kill their family would do nothing to dismantle their hatred for others. (Killing the terrorists is the only way to do that!)\n \n \n ...",

(I didn't say \"suspected terrorists\", I said \"terrorists\".)\n \n A suspected terrorist has the same rights as a suspected shoplifter. A trial proves whether or not he's a terrorist, if he's been arrested for suspicion of terrorism. If he's found guilty, he's no longer a suspected terrorist, he's a terrorist and should have no rights.\n \n There's another way to be proven a terrorist. A person fighting on the side of terrorists in a firefight is a terrorist. No trial required. He should be killed on the spot. No prisoners.\n \n There's yet another way. Osama Bin Laden claimed responsibility for the WTC attacks. He's a terrorist and should be killed. No trial required.\n \n \n \n \nP.S.\n Did you realize that the post you responded to wasn't addressed to you, but to syklopps61?\nI started this thread. I can respond to whatever I please. I responded to your misguided philosophy.\n \n You seem to want to invite the terrorists to a tea party and discuss a cease fire. They want to kill you. Maybe you should act like they do and want to kill them...first.\n \n It's really hard for some people to be convinced that there are cultures in the world that think entirely differently than you and your schoolmates.\n \n You cannot reason with a terrorist.
