   "Actually, there is a difference between being a christian nation and being a nation of christians. We are not the first, but we may be the second.\n \n It is interesting how so many christians claim that this country was founded on christian principles. If that were so, wouldn't it be logical to expect that Christ would be mentioned in at least some document from the founding of our country? Guess what. And with just a little bit of investigation you will find that the Declaration of Independence is recognized as an example of humanist philosophy. Many, if not most, of the founding fathers were deists (and humanists) rather than theists, and they certainly weren't christians.\n \n None of the first 6 Presidents were christians. Washington was a deist, Adams was a Unitarian, Jefferson was a deist and late in life a Unitarian, Madison was a deist, Monroe was probably a deist - maybe atheist, and J Q Adams was Unitarian.\n \n The best estimates of the population of the Unitates States at the time of the Revolutionary was are that between 5 to 15% were practicing christians, probably somewhere around 8% is realistic. More may have been nominally members of some christian church, but that was only because most states had established state religions.\n \n So, should \"under God\" be removed from the Pledge? Personally, I don't care. It is a piddly little thing but it is important to christians for some reason. Even though they were told by Jesus to pray in private, that seems to mean to make fundamentalist christianity a part of government in any way possible. If christian prayer imposed by government had not been so pervasive and offensive over the years, one little semi-religious token probably wouldn't have been important. But first there were efforts to teach religion in science classes that was defeated, then came Bible reading as a required part of public education, and then prayers in public schools, and prayers at graduation and at football games. And christians were screaming and whining about how their rights were being denied the whole time. 1st graders who don't want to say christian prayers could just not listen. Christians have pushed their religion down everyone's throat for so long that there has been a back lash and an unwillingness to allow even a hint of religion in the government. I think there are more important cases of the religious right using the government to impose fundamentalist christianity on everyone than a semi-religious, semi-patriotic ritual. For example, our Attorney General holds prayer meetings every morning. He claims that they are not mandatory but no one who wanted to keep his job has tested that claim. Faith based initiatives are administered by organizations that are allowed to discriminate in hiring based on religion, even though it is unconstitutional. The first organization to receive money from Bushes faith initiative was successfully sued for religious descrimination and lost the federal funding.\n \n You might be interested to know that there were three christian schools in the 10 member football conference of my high school (I also taught at that school). At football games, none of them said prayers over the PA. They played the National Anthem and got on with the game. That was in Montana - a very conservative state. I also taught in Massachusetts and prayers were never recited before football games there either. I was stunned the first time I heard a christian prayer recited at a public school football game.\n \n However, I digress. Back to the \"christian nation\" bit. If this is a \"christian nation\", why is there no mention of Christ in the Constitution? Not only is Christ not mentioned, God isn't mentioned either. And religion is mentioned only as three prohibitions against it. Article VI says that \"...no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.\" And the 1st Amendment has two clauses pertaining to religion: \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\"\n \n It should be noted that even though the religious freedom clauses of the 1st Amendment state restrictions against Congress only, the Supreme Court had found that this is a recognition of an individual right of each citizen, and a violation of either clause by any level of government, down to school districts, is a violation of the due process clause of the 14th Amendment. Thus, public school policies may not endorse nor support an establishment of religion - that means no christian prayers.\n \n If you want quick and handy test to decide if an action of government violates the 1st Amendment, here it is. This is the Lemon Test, defined by the Supreme Court in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602 (1971). If a law or government fails on any of the three tests, it is probably unconstitutional.\n \n 1) The government action must have a secular purpose.\n 2) The primary effect may not be to advance religion.\n 3) The government action must not foster excessive governmental entanglement with religion.\n \n Now consider the Pledge:\n \n Does the inclusion of \"under God\" have a secular purpose? Even though the Pledge itself may be a sem-patriotic ritual, that phrase has no secular purpose. (read the history of the Pledge)\n \n Is the primary effect to advance religion? Most certainly. Those who claim that this is a \"christian nation\" as justification make that clear.\n \n Does it entangle the government with religion? When every teacher in every classroom in every school district in every state recites it every day, it does.\n \n Those who don't see a problem with this, consider this hypothetical. Suppose that you have a small child that you send off to school. At the end of the first day your little dear tells you how the teacher is teaching the class a prayer. Do you think it is a good idea? Be honest. At the end of the week your little dear is ready to recite the prayer for you. Here is the beginning. \"Allah is the greatest. There is no God but Allah.\"\n \n Is it such a good idea now?",

   "Please ive already asked this is not the thread for gay rights! keep it to the pledge.\n\n true katie, this debate jumped way off course...\n \n ...but then again, not really. taking out \"under God\" from the pledge relates to separating state and church, which relates to defining a neutral government. my argument is that a neutral government shouldn't only be defined by separating state and church, but separating state and ALL special interest groups. this includes religion, homosexuals and evolutionists\n \n it ending up turning into a debate on how can you classify gays, and it could get worse if evolutionists get involved\n \n I'm willing to drop the whole notion though. debates like these get too heated and are too multidirectional. maybe I'll debate somebody on this in the debate tournament, under moderated conditions and one-on-one",

   "\n And it isn't from a lack of trying either. You can't teach sexuality. Either you are or you aren't. They've been teaching sex ed in schools for several decades now.\n\n \n I can understand teaching sex ed to high school students, but honestly, teaching it to young students? That's ridiculous. It's brainwashing. Homosexuality is not something you're born with; it's not normal, it's abnormal. If homosexualtiy were normal, there would be a split in the population of homosexuals and heterosexuals- but there isn't. Homosexuals make a minority of the population. By saying homosexuality is normal, you're also saying alcoholism is normal. Neither are. Homosexuality is a serious mental disorder- not something you're born with, once again, but something that can be fixed.",
