You stated that a human being's living body begins at and by their conception.\n\n The wording is very important since it carries many meanings and possible misinterpretations. Therefore, I would reword your bolded statement as \"A future but not yet existing human being's living body begins at and by their conception, but the human being themselves does not come into existence until later on in pregnancy, once mental existence is gained.\" or, simply, \"A future but not yet existing human being's living body begins at and by their conception\".

It's not as though there's a question as to what species they will grow into after all. Your rationale is contradictory and inconsistent at the most basic level of reasoning based on what you personally know about science and life. \n \n \nFirst of all, my position is not pro abortion. I would be quite happy if there were no more abortions performed ever but not because of a law (which I would find unjust) but because of eliminated need for abortion through improved contraception, sex education, etc.\n\n \n Of course your position is pro abortion. You just prefer to call it pro choice because you are still playing a game of semantics. You think that by defining the issue as you do that you somehow are relieved of the guilt for supporting a practice which leads to the death of 1.3 million babies each year in this country alone. \n \n You justify your pro abortion stance by making this about mental existence when you know darn well that if that child was just allowed to complete its normal and natural gestation period, that we have 7 BILLION living examples of real evidence on Earth as we speak of what it will grow into, which proves what those babies really are in truth and in fact if only allowed to develop normally rather than be snuffed out. \n \n \nI am not claiming that all biological life is measured by mental existence. I am claiming that biological life of INDIVIDUALS is measured by mental existence since, in my view, mental existence is what defines individuals. I am not the one who chose the term \"individual\", Chuz Life was. Blame him not me for the consequences of that choice of terms.\n\n \n The bolded exposes your erroneous position since you know all too well that people will design their views based on what they choose to believe according to their personal morality. You are attempting to justify abortion which you claim to find abhorrent by redefining what makes us human. You know that every single doctor on Earth today will tell you that a baby is alive at conception and immediately starts to grow and develop at that time. But like a slick lawyer who thinks you have found a loophole in the law, you proudly claim that because the fetus has no mental existence, it really isn't biologically alive yet.\n \n Talk about redefining words AO, you take first prize. You know what those babies are, even at conception. They are alive and developing. But you will actually justify their destruction since they haven't yet developed a mental existence yet. And you see that as a rational and moral position? I reject and pity such morality as found truly wanting. \n \n \nOn a last note, the bottom line is that, in my view:\n \n Individual = Person = human mind\n \n So, without a human mind, no individual / person can exist in any way, shape or form. Hypothetically, I would even say that a body is not necessary. If minds could be proven to exist without bodies - i.e. a soul - then I would call that body-less mind an \"individual\" or \"person\". In reality, there is no evidence whatsoever of souls, so this remains purely a hypothetical point.\n\n \n I don't even know where to start in critiquing this statement since I can't prove to you that the soul exists in any terms you would appreciate either, even though I know it does. So I will just say this, when a question like this which determines the life and death of perfectly innocent babies, how dare you not choose to ere on the side of caution and in favor of the baby since you have no evidence that the soul does not exist.\n \n What absolute arrogance and hubris to vote against preserving life when you admit that you have no evidence at all that human beings are soulless creatures. I also find it sad that since you have personally experienced love, joy, sympathy for others, compassion, ecstasy along with all of the other emotions and characteristics which make us human that you will just write these 1.3 million unborn human beings off each year due to a lack of evidence. Is that your idea of a moral and rational perspective? \n \n Would you vote for the defendant to be put to death if they aren't sure he's guilty of murder AO? Of course you wouldn't. Yet you will defend the murder of 1.3 million unborn babies per year because you have no evidence they have a soul. Do you see what I mean by inconsistent? And I must add contradictory based on what you know and have personally experienced in life about what makes us human. You're either the most morally compromised person I know (along with these other pro death advocates) or you are the most unobservant regarding your ability to judge and discern the value of our human natures.",

   "But you know very well, or should that just because mammals develop in stages, it is ludicrous to deny ones biological existence simply because it hasn't developed the mental existence yet. It is still a TOTALLY unique individual which is evidenced by the number of individuals you have met in your lifetime; no two ever being identical in every way. \n\n You keep ignoring the fact that the term \"individual\" is defined as \"person\". As such, it carries far more meaning than just the biological one - the critical meaning for me being that it has a mental existence, not just a biological one. All the individuals that I have met in my lifetime had mental existences. Again, \"individual\" is defined as \"person\". Until you address that point, then the rest of your arguement is irrelevant. I would be happy to give a different answer if a different term were chosen that doesn't carry the extra baggage of meaning. As long as you or Chuz Life stick to the term \"individual\" or any other similar term laden with meaning, I will stick to my answer.\n \nEven identical twins who share DNA are unique in their own ways based on their personal experiences within the same family, and their personal interpretations of those experiences. But here you are saying that because a fetus hasn't yet developed a mental existence it is somehow sub-human and not deserving of rights. It is inconsistent by any rational thought process. \n\n How is it inconsistent? I don't give a damn if a being has a unique set of DNA. DNA by themselves don't draw my sympathy and respect. I never expressed any opinion that it is unique DNA that count. I have always been consistent in stating that it is mental existence that counts. If you deny this, then I challenge you to find quotes from any of my posts that show any inconsistency in my message.\n \nI'm talking about defending the fact that even single celled creatures which have no mental existence and never will, are defended by you and your comrades as no doubt alive as biological organisms. It seems to me that since you intellectually and personally know that every single human being you have ever and will ever know was once a single celled creature with no mental existence also, that you could make the common sense leap that these fetuses have real and true value from the moment of conception. It's not as though there's a question as to what species they will grow into after all. Your rationale is contradictory and inconsistent at the most basic lever of reasoning based on what you personally know about science and life. \n\n I have highlighted the relevant point. I was once a single celled creature with no mental existence. The critical difference is that, at that point in time, it was not \"me\", it was just a body. It didn't become \"me\" until that body gained the mental existence that became \"me\". The body prior to that was not \"me\" since \"I\" didn't exist yet, just the mindless soulless body building up to become \"me\".\n \nOf course your position is pro abortion. You just prefer to call it pro choice because you are still playing a game of semantics. You think that by defining the issue as you do that you somehow are relieved of the guilt for supporting a practice which leads to the death of 1.3 million babies each year in this country alone. \n\n I challenge you to find any quote from any of my posts that say that abortion is a good thing. Just because I find that it might be occasionally necessary doesn't mean that I think it is a good thing. It is and should be a difficult decision for any woman since it does carry the clear negative consequence of ending the life of a potential person. I pity the woman who needs to make that decision but, given the consequences that many face if they carry an unwanted pregnancy to term, I think the women should have every right to choose abortion (prior to third trimester) if they find they need to. I carry no guilt whatsoever. That guilt is purely in YOUR imagination, not MINE.\n \nYou justify your pro abortion stance by making this about mental existence when you know darn well that if that child was just allowed to complete its normal and natural gestation period, that we have 7 BILLION living examples of real evidence on Earth as we speak which proves what those babies really are in truth and in fact if only allowed to develop normally rather than be snuffed out. \n\n That is the value of potential. I do value that potential, but potential is not actual realized fact (i.e. the embryos are not YET people) and, either way, I value that potential much less than I value a woman's right to her own body. \n \nThe bolded exposes your erroneous position since you know all too well that people will design their views based on what they choose to believe according to their personal morality. You are attempting to justify abortion which you claim to find abhorrent by redefining what makes us human. You know that every single doctor on Earth today will tell you that a baby is alive at conception and immediately starts to grow and develop at that time. But like a slick lawyer who thinks you have found a loophole in the law, you proudly claim that because the fetus has no mental existence, it really isn't biologically alive yet.\n\n I am not redefining what makes us human. I am defining what makes us people - big difference. Also, since our society has never come to a consensus about when people start, then I am not redefining anything - just stating one of the numerous views that are out there about that question.\n \nTalk about redefining words AO, you take first prize. You know what those babies are, even at conception. They are alive and developing. But you will actually justify their destruction since they haven't yet developed a mental existence yet. And you see that as a rational and moral position? I reject and pity such morality as found truly wanting. \n\n You keep missing the point. It doesn't matter to me if they are alive and developing. It matters to me what they are at that moment. Specifically, whether they are people. Minds deserve rights (whether conscious or not), bodies don't.\n \nI don't even know where to start in critiquing this statement since I can't prove to you that the soul exists in any terms you would appreciate either, even though I know it does. So I will just say, when a question like this which determines the life and death of perfectly innocent babies, how dare you not choose to ere on the side of caution and in favor of the baby since you have no evidence that the soul doesn't exist.\n\n One can just as easily claim that souls exist in the unfertilized egg so that contraception is murder. As long as theories have no basis in demonstratable reality, then they are completeley arbitrary and unfounded. We need to base our laws on demonstrated reality, not on arbitrary guesses.\n \nWhat absolute arrogance and hubris to vote against preserving life when you admit that you have no evidence at all that human beings are soulless creatures. I also find it sad that since you have personally experienced love, joy, sympathy for others, compassion, ecstasy along with all of the other emotions and characteristics which make us human that you will just write these 1.3 million unborn human beings off each year due to a lack of evidence.

   "Loaded question. There are several possible answers to this question, so I'll include 'em as I go. It's worth noting that verifying your prediction, Chuz, is not evidence of 'weakness'. It's evidence that an organism does not immediately 'become alive'; it's an ongoing, subjective process - you may as well ask 'at what point does a painting become a work of art'?\n \n I'd start with a related question to you: at what point does a person become officially 'dead'? Medically, you die when your brain ceases to function. Going by this, you officially become 'alive' when your brain starts to work in the first place - which is usually about second-trimester. \n \n I would guess that this would be my main response. However, there are others...\n \n At what point do the cells in your body become 'alive'? Most of the cells that make up your body at the moment were not alive when you were born, so the question must be rephrased to 'at what point were any of the cells that once made up any part of your body alive'? This would be back before conception, when the relevant egg and sperm cells were created in the relevant parents.\n \n A third version: \"at which point were you an alive human individual?\" Ignoring the personality-based semantics of the word 'individual' - until the umbilical cord is cut, a baby is at best a symbiote to it's mother, at worst a parasite (the only reason the mother's body does not attack the baby as a foreign intruder is that the foetus uses the same tactics (very similar proteins, even) to 'hide' from the mother's immune system). The answer (semantics aside) here would be - when the umbilical cord is cut.\n \n I could probably go on, but I think you've got my point. As a direct answer: you are alive when you become concious, because we define death as permanent loss of conciousness. However, the whole concept of 'life' as something with a definitive start and end is a false one.",

I do, however, appreciate it when people use logic to prove me wrong since that in itself is a learning experience and gives me an opportunity to refine my stance or, occasionally, completely revise it. If they prove me wrong and also make a disparaging quip, I may resent the quip but try to overlook it due to the value of the logical analysis. However, if someone only makes a quip and makes no arguement against my point, then there is no redeaming value - only irrationality. Irrationality can only be tolerated when supported by rationality. So, please, if you cannot help yourself in making such quips, then at least support them by logical debate that proves the opposition wrong.

If you are trying to get everyone to agree on an initial premise for a later argument, the way to do so is by argument of your own, not with thinly veiled insults or (as I suspect is coming) a flurry of arguments from authority.\n \n \nOk, I thought this was a debate forum where we could invite one another to debate specific issues.

   "In addendum to my previous post.\n \n Here is the Wiki page on the word 'Individual'. Not a brilliant choice for support, but you did ask.\n \n Let's dip in.\n \n \nAs commonly used, individual refers to a person or to any specific object in a collection. In the 15th century and earlier, and also today within the fields of statistics and metaphysics, individual means \"indivisible\", typically describing any numerically singular thing, but sometimes meaning \"a person.\" (q.v. \"The problem of proper names\"). From the seventeenth century on, individual indicates separateness, as in individualism.[1] Individuality is the state or quality of being an individual; a person separate from other persons and possessing his or her own needs, goals, and desires.\n\n This would suggest a need to be separate from others, and the possession of goals and desires would suggest some level of thought. It's a start.\n \n \nDescartes\n In his statement Cogito ergo sum (\"I think therefore I am\"), Rene Descartes posits the notion the individual subject, distinct from the world around him or her. This is the most famous articulation of subject-object dualism (see subject-object problem) in the Western philosophical tradition.\n\n There's the idea of thought again, and separateness too.\n \n \nExistentialism\n With the rise of existentialism, Kierkegaard rejected Hegel's notion of the individual as subordinated to the forces of history. Instead, he elevated the individual's subjectivity and capacity to choose his or her own fate. Later Existentialists built upon this notion. Nietzsche, for example, examines the individual's need to define his/her own self and circumstances in his concept of the will to power and the heroic ideal of the \u00dcbermensch. The individual is also central to Sartre's philosophy, which emphasizes individual authenticity, responsibility, and free will. In both Sartre and Nietzsche (and in Nikolai Berdyaev), the individual is called upon to create his or her own values, rather than rely on external, socially imposed codes of morality.\n\n Here we go again with the thought, and throw in some responsibility and free will too. Responsibity might, at a push, be something like fending for oneself, I suppose.\n \n So, there you go. The individual. The thinking, free-willing, responsible and separate individual.",

Enough to know that it is you (not I) who is using the definitions to exclude \"individuality\" rather than to recognize it for what it is, given the particular stage of life the \"individual\" organism is in.\n \n \nWhat you should have asked is what kind of individual I was then, then still an embryo. I have already supplied the answer to that one. \n\n \n Ok, so you were once an organism in the embryonic stage of your life. But you weren't at that time and \"individual\",.... you were just an \"individual organism?\" Riiiight. And and now you are an \"individual\" AND \"an \"individual organism!\" \n \n No play on semantics with that one, huh?\n \n \nAnd then you revert to defining a zygote once more. I have no poblem with this definition of a zygote, but where does it state that this zygote is an INDIVIDUAL? You have yet to give an honest answer on that one. \n\n \n Only you, Smiley.... So far, you are the only one who claims that an \"individual zygote\" is indeed an \"individual organism\" but can't be legitimately referred to as being an \"individual\" in this discussion\n \n \nI am quickly coming to the same view, as 'Another Opinion'. You are not an honest debater. Unless you stop twisting my words and using schoolchild tactics in this debate I will be gone. I suggest you actually come up with some proof of your position rather than making smarmy comment about mine. \n\n \n \n emoticon_xbye Ok,...

   "Chuz Life: Since it appears that I am not the only one whose views you purposely distort, I have taken the action of reporting you to the forum administrator. If you continue such actions and repeatedly violate forum rules, then you will eventually be kicked out, so be careful in keeping debates honest.\n \n Here is the e-mail which I sent to the forum administrator:\n \nChuz Life, a recent poster on this forum, has proven to be a dishonest poster in violating the following rule which you have all new registrees agree to:\n \n Do not exaggerate or misrepresent other user's post. \n \n This is the first time that I have reported another forum participant and it is mainly due to the danger posed to honest debate by the distortions of such a poster. I have never reported mere flamers since their posts are generally not taken seriously except by those who already hold their views. However, a poster such as Chuz Life is one that has the appearance of being a rational and logical poster but, because of their distortions, can mislead impressionable and less experienced readers through dishonest tactics - far more dangerous to genuine debate and, I would guess, the very reason why you posted these rules to begin with.\n \n One set of evidence of Chuz Life's violation of the rule of misrepresenting another user's post is in the four times in which Chuz Life misrepresented my posts in the thread \"When does a human individuals life begin? \" of the Abortion forum. Note, typically, Chuz Life correctly quotes the opponent, but then misrepresents the opponent's views by rewording them falsely. The three violations are as follows:\n \n Violation #1: In post # 6, Chuz Life quoted my views as \"To specify my own views, I think that the bodies of unique individuals / people start at conception but that body does not become a person / individual until the beginning of mental existence, which cannot start before roughly the third trimester.\" He then misrepresented my views by saying : \"The second paragraph of your post is more in line with what I was looking for. It's clear that you agree that (at least) a person's living body (a living human individual's body) begins at and by their \"conception.\"\". At the time, I thought that this was an honest misunderstanding, and corrected him in my post #9: \n \"It is not the body of an individual until an individual comes into existence. Again, individual = person by the very definition which you linked. Before that body becomes an individual / person by gaining some mental existence, it is just a body with \"nobody home\" belonging to no one except the mother since she is the only individual in existence at that point in time who has any relevance.\"\n Violation #2: Chuz Life then took my answer from post #9 and again misrepresented it in his post #10: \" But you have already addressed the aspect of my poll that i was seeking from you, AO... You stated that a human being's living body begins at and by their conception.\" I responded to this misrepresentation in my post #12 : \n \"The wording is very important since it carries many meanings and possible misinterpretations. Therefore, I would reword your bolded statement as \"A future but not yet existing human being's living body begins at and by their conception, but the human being themselves does not come into existence until later on in pregnancy, once mental existence is gained.\" or, simply, \"A future but not yet existing human being's living body begins at and by their conception\". It is very important, in my view, to differentiate between the body before it becomes a human being (= person = individual) and the body once it gains mental existence, at which point it is a human being. I will not agree to any statements of my opinion that do not make that point clear.\"\n Violation #3: So, Chuz Life took another tactic and, in post #21, asked \"So, to take some of the emotions out of this thread,... please tell me when you believe an individual \"horse's\" life biologically begins?\" to which I answered, in post #22:\n \"I would think that the term \"horse\" is generally perceived to only be a technical term denoting that species and, for most of us, is not a term that carries any horse-equivalent sense of personhood and does not necessarily automatically bring to mind the personality of a horse (except for those people who work with horses or deal with animal rights). For most of us, it is a fairly neutral term - the equivalent of the \"individual human life form\" term I used in a previous post.\n \n So, given the neutrality of that term for most people, then I would agree that the life of a horse begins at conception.\"\n Chuz Life then misrepresented this view in his post #30: \"Like you said, (to summarize) a horse, a human, a pig, a cow... the lives of every Individual mammal (in general) begins at each their individual biological \"conceptions.\"\" I responded to his mirepresentation in my post #31:\n \"Please stop trying to reword my views. I would agree with the view of most of that except for \"a human\". As I have said over and over, one has to be VERY careful which terms one uses for humans since words about humans are very loaded with meaning that words about mammals are not (at least as far as I can tell). A human also can be interpreted as \"a person\". You might call this quibling but it is a major point of contention that you just don't seem to understand. One cannot just take a word that carries the meaning of \"person\" and then pretend that it does not carry that meaning. As long as you use a word that carries that meaning, then you will get the same range of answers from us, depending on our personal definition of \"person\". Do you or do you not understand the concept that the terms one uses are important?\"\n Chuz Life contested whether or not this is a misrepresentation in his post #32 and I answered him in my post #37. He had no counter-response to those arguements.\n \n Meanwhile: From post #42 to post #47, we had a dispute about definitions where \"human being\" is, by the dictionary, defined in two ways - 1) biologically as the species and 2) as person, where Chuz Life insisted on using the biological definition but I insisted that I would not agree to using the biological definition but insisted on the definition as \"person\" and would walk out of the thread if he kept to that purely biological definition.\n \n Violation #4: So, Chuz Life tried yet another tactic. By asking, in post #50: \"Do you agree with me, that a human embryo is (for the sake of this discussion) a living human organism?\"\n \n to which I responded, in post #51: \"Yes, I agree that a human embryo is a living human organism and can be defined purely as that.\"\n \n At which point, in post #54, he once again misrepresented my view as saying: \"Right now I just want to get as many as possible to agree that a human being's life \"biologically speaking\" begins at and by their \"conception.\" \" - which obviously meant that he thought I had agreed to that statement.\n \n After that last violation, I gave up on the debate with Chuz Life and left the thread - stating, in post #59:\n \"NO NO NO NO NO!\n \n I never agreed that a human being's life begins at conception. I have made clear over and over that, since a human being is defined as a person, and since I view a person as starting at mental existence, then anything preceding that is not a human being. THerefore, the human embryo may be a human organism but it is NOT a human being. This is the third time now that you have distorted my views and I am getting very tired of the dishonesty and am very quickly losing patience with you.\"------------------------\n \n I know this is a long e-mail, and I am grateful for your patience in reading through it, but it was necessary in order to outline the specifics in how Chuz Life distorts his opponent's views. \n \n He apparently similarly distorted smiley's views since, in post #76, he writes \"I am quickly coming to the same view, as 'Another Opinion'. You are not an honest debater. Unless you stop twisting my words and using schoolchild tactics in this debate I will be gone.\" However, I will not detail those distortions in this e-mail. That is up to smiley.\n \n I hope that I have sufficiently proved my case and that you recognize that Chuz Life did indeed violate forum rules. So, please, let Chuz Life know that this is not acceptable and, if he continues to repeat such tactics after any warning on your part, consider banning him from the forum.\n \n Regards,\n \n \"Another Opinion\"\n \n",

I am trying to get everyone (as many people as possible) to agree on three things.\n \n 1: That mammals (including human beings) are biological \"organisms.\"\n \n 2: That the point of which said organisms become uniquely identifiable (the point of which their biological life begins) (as you indicated it is with horses) is in fact the moment of \"conception.\" \n \n 3: That religion, \"souls\" and all that other hocus pocus has nothing to do with it. \n \n Can we or can we not agree on those three things?\n \n \n Again, I look forward to getting Admin's take on it.... and (as I agreed to in advance) I'll abide by his/ her / their decisions.\n \n I do find it odd that you of all people would report someone else,... alledging that they do what you yourself did in Post #12\n \n It's very telling that you can still feel like I've mischaracterized your views when I tell you that \"I get it\" and your respond \"good I was starting to wonder.\"\n \n POST; #41\n \n You are clearly mad that I would not allow you to dictate the parameters of this debate (post# 47)\n \n So, having no other alternative, you go for the chance of censoring your opposition.\n \n Unfortunately, that doesn't reflect any better on you than does your splitting of hairs on the use of the word \"individual.\"\n \n I accepted that you were (are) frustrated and ready to leave the debate, so I had (have) no reason to debate with you anymore. \n \n You feel your views have been mischaracterized, even as I helped clarify them for you in Post #39.

   "You don't know how much I actually wish you were \"right,\" A.O.\n \n But, you have offered absolutely nothing short of your claims and plays on semantics to support them.\n\n I can make the same claim about you. You use words in the wrong way (at least in the wrong way in how one typically defines words with multiple definitions in dictionaries). Words are important since they carry meaning that can translate into policy. If you choose to distort definitions then you are not only playing semantics but playing them illogically.\n \nThe purpose of this thread was the debate the moment that an individual human bein's \"biological\" life begins.\n\n But by debating the moment when an individual HUMAN BEING's \"biological\" life begins then we have to agree on what a human being is. That is our disagreement. Human being is defined as \"person\" by the dictionary in a social context. If one chooses a biological context AND STAYS IN THAT BIOLOGICAL CONTEXT, then one might argue otherwise. However, even then (1) it is not certain that human being is defined from conception since different biological sources seem to be contradictory on that point and (2) any definition derived from a biological context changes once you go to a social context since the dictionary SAYS that the meaning is different in a social context - no longer being purely biological but taking on the new meaning of \"person\". Therefore, it makes no sense to start a discussion in the unrelated direction of the purely biological definition of human being. ****Human being is defined DIFFERENTLY in a biological context vs in a social context**** That is what your very dictionary says. Why don't you believe it? The dictionary gives MULTIPLE definitions, depending on context. That is how dictionaries work.\n \nWhat you are doing, AO (to put it bluntly),... you are putting the onus on the new human. To live long enough and grow, mature and develop to an arbitrarily drawn point..... after which you can't find any reason to deny them their \"personhood\" any longer.\n\n Again I am putting no onus on a new human since, given the definition of human as \"person\", no human exists until the mental existence comes into play. Before that, it is just a \"human organism\" or mindless body. I don't care what anyone does with that mindless body. Its only value is in the person that it WILL become, not in what it IS.\n \nHuman's don't sexually reproduce like frogs and butterfiles do (metamorphosis) and something can't \"begin\" after it has already \"began.\"\n\n This is utterly absurd. Who said that humans sexually reproduce like frogs or butterflies?

However, this is not seen to be the case (or even to be possible), because by calling a zygote a 'person' you have already implicitly defined a zygote has 'personhood' - that's what a 'person' is. So when you try and claim that A_O has said that 'a human beings life starts at conception', or 'an individuals life starts at 'conception', or 'a persons life starts at conception', he disagrees with you - because in each of those cases the language you use to describe an unintelligent, unaware, unconscious collection of cells implies that 'personhood' has already been bestowed upon it, which is not the case.\n \n A_O has said* that the life of an organism with unique human DNA starts at conception. I wouldn't even go that far - I'd say that the 'existence' of an organism with unique human DNA starts at conception. Neither of us has said that the organism is an 'individual', a 'person' or a 'human being' - and when you insist on pretending that we have used those terms, we (quite understandably, IMO) call you out on 'playing semantics' - because the language you are using includes implications which we did not put there in the first place and which (we suspect) will be vital in your later arguments**.\n \n *Feel free to correct me on this, AO\n \n **Largely due to \"The abortion debate is more of a concern for \"individual\" rights and not just rights in general,.... so the debate itself needs to be more focused on the \"individual\" aspects of a person's life, rights etc. (Namely,.. \"when does a human \"individual's\" life begin and what are their rights to the life they are living?\")\" ~Chuz Lite (from here).\n \n EDIT: Oh, and thanks for proving my own little prediction quite correct.

You think you are qualified to disregard them as so many disposable cells when you know all too well that they are growing and developing in the normal and expected way that the rest of us did. \n\n Mental existence is how I define personhood. It is no more arbitrary than your definition of personhood starting at the single cell of the zygote. Indeed, my view of personhood and rights is far more supported than yours given the historical reason why rights were introduced in the first place. Also, I have noted to you on a multitude of posts already that the fact that it is developing is irrelevant, in my view. What is relevant to rights is what the embryo/fetus is AT THAT MOMENT not what it WILL BE. What IS is not the same as what WILL BE. You seem to constantly be mixing them up.\n \nAnd I have never run away from a debate with you or anyone else. I simply state my case a couple of different ways over multiple posts and when I get the same exact repeated lip service which claims that I don't get it, when I get your game of semantics with human life perfectly, I just walk away and leave you to your own hypocritical devices.\n\n That just means that, when you are proven wrong, then instead of PROVING your point that it is semantics, you just make disparaging remarks and run away.

The more relevant example would be the \"violinist\" scenario that has been brought up in this forum various times. For example, if I (substituting for the violinist) suddenly got sick and could only be kept alive by being attached to another person, then I would be quite grateful to that other person for agreeing to support me. I would then say that the rules of that support or his ability to cut me off, thereby killing me, would be similar to the rules I would place on third trimester abortions (since we are dealing with two minds - two people, one physically dependent on the body of the other). In other words, if his support of me threatened his life or significantly threatened his health, then he should have the right to disconnect me - thereby causing my death. This is only fair since I would expect the same right if I were in his shoes.\n \n As for not getting aborted, sure I am glad that I was not aborted in the first or second trimester since, if that had happened, I never would have come into existence. However, I am equally glad that my parents did not use contraceptives since, then, I also would not have come into existence. I view both cases as essentially the same and, in neither case, would I think that their acts of either early stage abortion or using contraception should have been made illegal. Either way, if they had used contraception or had aborted me in early stages then there would never have been an \"I\" who could have been able to tell the difference.",

However, once we soon go into debating the question of abortion and rights, then he magically wants to re-attach the meaning of \"person\" back into those terms and use all of your quotes from the biological discussion without taking that change of definition into account - a dishonest tactic that none of us are falling for (which is getting the pro-life members here increasingly frustrated).\n \nA_O has said* that the life of an organism with unique human DNA starts at conception.

We know that he will not STAY in the biological domain, so we are unwilling to drop the connotation of person from the word \"individual\" (human / human being) since we know full well that he will distort definitions and distort quotes since he has already demonstrated that numerous times in this thread alone.\n \n Also, yes, I think that the life of an organism with unique human DNA starts at conception. This is mainly because the building blocks that will form that organism that exist prior to conception may be alive, but they do not constitute the unique human DNA that genetically define the organism. Since \"organism\" does not carry any extra non-biological meaning, I am fine with this statement.

I've said before that 'life' is a subjective term.\n\n Granted, at that early stage right after conception, the fertilized egg can still split into two to make identical twins with identical DNA. However, one has to be careful. If someone takes a skin scraping from you, injects that DNA into an egg (as was done with Dolly the sheep) and clones you, does that mean that your body is not an organism with unique human DNA? For me, the important thing for the beginning of a human organism is that the DNA are in place which define it. I suppose that it is not as important that the DNA is unique except in the sense that it is unique from the life forms that spawned it (sperm and egg in this case) and is complete. Since we can all be cloned, one might say that none of our DNA are guaranteed to be unique.\n \n However, I do get your point that what \"it will be\" is not individualistic at the stage immediately after conception since one zygote can split into two twins so you can't say that the zygote was one that grew into Joe or that the zygote was one that grew into Fred (Joe and Fred being twins in this case) but that zygote grew into both Joe and Fred. That is not the case with cloning since you are still you both before and after you are cloned and the cloned being was never you. Though very few zygotes actually do split, this is not actually relevant for the great majority of zygotes but it IS potentially relevant for each zygote (you never know if it will split). Ok, then . You convinced me. When, then, would you say that what \"it will be\" is firmly established?",

   "Again, there are many people here that are still denying the biological fact that a human individual's life \"biologically\" begins at and by their conception. So that portion of your premise is wrong. Many people are \"arguing that.\"\n\n \n It depends on how you define a \"human individual\". We can define it by biology, that's obvious. But it hasn't yet reached the point where this individual life, is a sentient human person. \n \n \nSecondly, your comment about \"general thought.\" It was once \"generally thought\" that blacks were less than full person's too. They were considered savages and enslaved for generations, by societies who \"generally thought\" them to be less than equal \"persons\" and deserving of Constitutional protections of their rights.\n \n It's the very same kind of denialability that's taking place in the abortion issue today.\n\n \n This general thought about when the human person begins is based on evidence and reason, however. In the early stages of development, the thalamus is not connected to the cerebral cortex by nerve cell circuits, so logically, based on evidence, there is no sentience. It hasn't reached this stage as yet, as much as you can correctly and biologically call it an individual life. It's not a human person. \n \n \nA person's life begins when it begins,... not just when it convienient to the rest of society and not just when we can't justify our denial of it any more.\n\n \n You're defining a person by a simple biological and genetic truism. A woman gets to live her life as she chooses, and her life supercedes the right of the non-sentient form of life which is totally dependent on her for its survival. What is being a human person without a choice? Most of these lives will be lost by spontaneous abortion anyway.

But it hasn't yet reached the point where this individual life, is a sentient human person.\n\n \n I agree, Jake. And I never claimed a zygote, embryo or even a fetus to be \"sentient.\" But besides that point, the poll for this thread and the comments from many of those on your side of the issue come up a little short on forming a concensus on what you just indicated. (that it's obvious that a human individual's life \"biologically\" begins at conception.\n \n I'll gladly debate and discuss all the other aspects to a human individual (sentience, brain waves, ability to feel pain and all that),... but not until we all agree that their individual biological life begins at conception.\n \n \nThis general thought about when the human person begins is based on evidence and reason, however.

(do we use them to include what could be a new (class of) human individual(s) or do we use those definitions to exclude them?)\n \n I believe things (especially things like human beings) should be defined by the human attributes they have,... and not by the ones they may temporarily lack.\n \n It really is as simple as that.",

   "AO,... You are aware that scientists routinely define human beings \"purely\" in the biological sense,... aren't you?\n \n Have you ever searched for any references to support your claims that they do not? \n \n This search took me all of 1 minute. The reading of these threads would take hours,... but just from the text I see in the search, You should e able to see that your allegation above is not correct.\n \n Human's, \"persons\" if you will are biological creatures complete with a biological \"beginning\" to their uniquely individual life. Your desperate desire to deny that fact is completely understandable. But, I don't see how you can expect myself or others to share in your ignorance of the mounting pile of evidence that prove against your claims.\n \n Biologically speaking, a human individual (being's) life begins at and by their conception. It's a scientific fact. Whether you or I like it or not. \n \n It is what it is.\n\n You are missing the point and always have been. Whether or not science defines an embryo or zygote as a \"human being\" when speaking in a scientific context is irrelevant to any debate that will eventually lead to discussion of social issues. That is why I have not engaged in such a debate - because of its irrelevancy. The definition of the word(s) \"human being\" or \"a human\" or \"an individual\" that are relevant to any social context is \"a person\" - by the very dictionaries that you quote.\n \n Do you or don't you understand the concept that words are used differently in different context and you cannot just switch back and forth between the definitions at your pleasure? That is how dictionaries work - you have to stick to the relevant definition. In this case, if and only if we were going to STAY in a biological discussion (ex. launch into a discussion of the physical traits of human beings as opposed to, say, chimpanzees), then using the words human being / human / individual might stay purely biological since their definition of \"person\" is relevant to the social issues more so than biological issues. You want to use definitions illegally by switching back and forth between them - clearly either a purposely dishonest tactic or a tactic that is a result of your ignorance of how dictionaries work.\n \n To demonstrate how dictionaries and their relevancy toward the use of words work, take an example:\n \n The word \"right\" can be defined in multiple ways: From dictionary.com : \n 1. in accordance with what is good, proper, or just: right conduct. \n 2. in conformity with fact, reason, truth, or some standard or principle; correct: the right solution; the right answer. \n 3. correct in judgment, opinion, or action. \n 4. fitting or appropriate; suitable: to say the right thing at the right time. \n ...\n 11. (often initial capital letter) of or pertaining to political conservatives or their beliefs. \n \n Using your use of words, that would mean that the Right (meaning conservative politics) is right (meaning good and truthful) because they both use the same words. Perhaps this wasn't the best example because you probably believe that Right is right but hopefully you are logical enough to get my point. Same word - different definitions for different contexts. That is something that I am seriously doubting that you understand.\n ----------------------------\n \n On a last note, here is part of a description on how to use dictionaries from yourdictionary.com: http://www.yourdictionary.com/library/article003.html :\n \n \nWords also often have more than one meaning. Run, for example, generally means \"to move fast on foot\". However, that is not what we mean when we say \"the water is running.\" Run can also mean \"to flow (said of liquids)\". Neither of these meanings apply to the use of run in \"John runs a small bookstore.\" Here run means \"to manage\". Dictionaries usually list all the unrelated meanings, giving each a separate number. (You can confirm this by looking up run in any of the on-line dictionaries listed at the bottom of this page.)\n\n Note that I bolded their term \"unrelated\". As with the multiple definitions of \"human being\", \"individual\", etc. - the biological definitions are UNRELATED to the definitions of these terms as \"person\". You don't understand how dictionaries work since you think that they ARE related - WRONG !",

If you can prove otherwise,... now's your chance!\n\n ...the times I've done this, you've ignored my posts. I have done it twice, now.\n \n Collecting past responses in a third attempt (and adding lots more - see part 1)... here goes nothing.\n \n 1) Of all the words you've linked too as 'suggested reading' in your OP, you haven't included the most important one: 'life'.\n Probably the most relevant definition from dictionary.com defines 'life' as 'the animate existence or period of animate existence of an individual'. Something alive also manifests 'the power of adaptation to environment through changes originating internally'. Neither of these features match a zygote.\n Merriam-Webster goes one step further, it states that 'life' is '5a: the period from birth to death'. The medical M-R includes the definitions '1 a: the quality that distinguishes a vital and functional plant or animal from a dead body' - we've been over this before in one of my first posts in this thread: in humans ('human individuals', even), this distinguishing feature is brain activity. Another excerpt from the medical M-R: '2 a: the sequence of physical and mental experiences that make up the existence of an individual'. Note 'experiences' (and 'mental'). A zygote does not experience anything.\n Wikipedia also throws a wrench into your idea that life has an absolute scientific definition: 'There is no universal definition of life. To define life in unequivocal terms is still a challenge for scientists'.\n \n 1.5) More definition-based stuff. birth, from your own link, includes the definition 'any coming into existence'. This isn't a massively strong line of argument - but it just highlights the fact that dictionary wars are kinda pointless.\n \n 2) We've discussed previously how an 'individual' must be 'independent' - that is, they must be able to exist without the external aid of another organism. The fact that a zygote is entirely reliant on external aid for it's continued existence (as more than a collection of molecules - to be as persnickety as to argue this is to include, for example, ice as capable of 'existence' in a fire, because the water molecules are still present) kinda outrules it's 'individuality'.\n \n 3) At conception, the only thing that happens is the occurrence of unique DNA - the cells were alive both before and after this point. This does not, however, mean that a unique individual will be formed as a result - nor does a unique individual have to be the result of a single conception. See large parts of the twins wiki article - identical twins share the same DNA and the same conception point - are they the same 'individual'? Turning it on it's head, a 'chimera' organism (again, see the wiki article) has different parts with different DNA - one 'individual' can result from two conceptions. Does this individual have two 'lives'?\n \n To sum up: you are claiming that a fertilised egg is a 'newly alive human individual'. I agree that the zygote is 'human'; but that's about as far as it goes. The cell(s) making up a zygote are 'alive' - but the sperm and egg that made up a zygote were just as alive; there is no 'newly' if you wish to use this form of the definition. The zygote is also not an 'individual' - it is dependent on other organisms for it's continued existence, and it may directly turn into either two (or more) individuals, or end up as a mere fraction of a complete individual.\n \n I'd also add, for the [repetitive]'th time, that an 'individual' in the biological sense is not synonymous with an 'individual' in the social sense.",

   "the times I've done this, you've ignored my posts.\n\n Can I chalk this up to a third time, then?\n \n \nThat's your opinion of course.\n\n Absolutely, just as your own semantic nitpicking is your own opinion. If you want to prove my opinion wrong, I'll need some evidence that a zygote is animate, or that it can adapt to an environment. \n \n \nEspecially when it's your desperate desire to use (of all things) a semantic argument for their denial.\n'Semantic argument'? I have to say, that's remarkably ironic given that: you've repeatedly blurred the line between 'individual' (adjective) and 'individual' (noun) and you've relied heavily on your own 'cherry-picking' of definitions. \n \n \nWhile I encourage people to look things up for themselves and form their conclusions from that.\n...so I've looked things up, I've formed my own conclusion. I've even presented my opinion to you with my reasoning - something which you have as yet failed (for the most part) to do. You still seem to have an issue, unfortunately. If you think you can find a counter-argument in alternate definitions, feel free... but I doubt that you can, else you would have used it by now rather than use a watered-down version of your original 'wow, your logic is inferior' line.\n \n \nYou are certainly not going to convince me that a living human zygote is not really \"alive\" or living it's (his or her) own life.\nSo much for an open mind, alas... \n \n \nEspecially with evidence such as \"an organism's aging begins at conception\" and \"invitro-fertilizations\" proving the opposite of your semantic claims,... with reality.\nSo... you have a quote from someone saying that cells age from conception, and the fact that an egg can be fertilised externally before it is replaced in the mother. Of these two, one is 'reality' (your quote is not free from semantics either...), and one is relevant (a zygote is still dependent on the mother after it is fertilised). Neither is both.\n \n You provide arguments that are largely semantic-driven. You refuse to address counter-arguments because \"it's too semantics-based\" - how chimeraism and identical twins are 'semantics' is something that I suspect you will refuse to justify.\n \n I suggest you take your own advice regarding 'intellectual honesty'. Either deal with semantic arguments - or don't use them yourself. Either let people make up their own mind - or don't mock them when they have without an argument of your own.

Otherwise abortion kills nothing more than a collection of cells - just as the spermicide in a condom kills millions of cells.\n\n \n Arguably? \n \n If it's arguable, it's hardly an absolute.\n \n Consider the current legal definition for a \"person.\"\n \n That's relevant, isn't it?\n \n PERSON\n \n 1: \"natural person\" \n \n 2: the body of a human being\n \n also \n : the body and clothing of a human being \n Example: had drugs on his person\n \n 3: one (as a human being or corporation) that is recognized by law as the subject of rights and duties \n \n Note the absense of a requirement for thought, ability to breathe, feel pain or anything like that.\n \n And,... Tell me something, Iangb... a Human fetus is a living human organism,... biologically unique, alive, etc. What kind of body does it have if not a \"human body?\"\n \n (this question presumes that you are already aware that human's don't morph out of non human organisms and into a being that you can no longer deny)",

   "If you don't have the time, who cares \"why the want.\" A good reason would help you \"make the time?\" or what?\n\n Nope, just curious. Now I'm curious about why you're avoiding the question, as well.\n \n \nHUH,.. and if not conception,... when did that begin again?\nSorry, I have absolutely no clue what you are referring to when you say 'when did that' begin again'. You could mean individualization, but (as shown previously) that happens after conception, when the zygote first splits. You could mean 'life', but that isn't mentioned in the passage you quoted...\n \n What did you mean?\n \n \nNo, iangb... I didn't mix anything. The subject of this thread is \"when does a human individual's life biologically begin.\" This definition is but one of many that describe in the most intricate details \"how\" that life is began. With a single cell division that (through individuation) forms, grows, develops and further matures the new child until one day he or she reaches a point,... after which even you can't deny them their rights anymore.\n \n The key word in all of it is \"begin.\" \nSo now an essential part of 'life' is that it undergoes individuation? Where did that come from?\n I hate to raise it again after you've valiantly ignored it so far, but an embryo can split into two unique 'individuals' up to 15 days after fertilisation. Doesn't this imply a flexibility to your definition beyond the rigid terms you are trying to impose? Could it even be that you are trying to use the wrong definition - because the definition you use results in inconsistencies?\n \n \nAgain,... the key word is \"begin.\" The new individual's unigue DNA is created when? The aging process \"begins\" when? Clearly, individualation begins when cell division does. But if conception had not taken place, there would be no cell division of the new individual's DNA. Would there.\n\n The unique DNA is made at conception - but DNA alone does not a unique life make - see my identical twins and chimera organisms. All cells age - the egg and sperm cells also age, so the fact that the cells in a zygote age is nothing special. If the egg had not been produced, there would have been no fertilisation for you to try and label as an 'initial cause'.\n The key word may indeed be 'begin' - but there are lots of beginnings, and 'new DNA' is but one of them. However, seeing as we are looking at whether abortion is 'killing' or not, I'd say an equally key word is 'life'. I'm guessing you haven't yet found a definition of 'life' that suits your liking, or you'd have posted it by now.\n \n \nArguably?\n \n If it's arguable, it's hardly an absolute.\nSince when did I make any claims that 'life' is absolute? The fact that we are arguing about this proves that it is arguable.\n \n \nConsider the current legal definition for a \"person.\"\n \n That's relevant, isn't it?\n\n \nEspecially when it's your desperate desire to use (of all things) a semantic argument ... you bury those points in a semantic play on words as if you really believe that you can pick and choose (for other readers) which definitions apply and which ones don't\n\n Quoted for irony. Onwards to the semantics!\n \n Your favourite highlight here is 'the body of a human being'. There are lots of ways I could reply to this - to name some:\n 1) If you can pick a single definition to use as absolute, so can I - in which case I won this a long time ago with part 1) of post #213.\n 2) Looking at dictionary.com gives me the 'legal' definition as 'Law: a human being (natural person) ... recognized by law as having rights and duties.' Seeing as a foetus has no rights (and certainly no duties!) your point falls flat.\n 3) To argue that a zygote is a 'human being' is to drag the whole thing back to the 'personhood' argument, as 'human being' implies 'human individual' - which is different from 'individual human'.\n 4) To imply that a single cell (as it is at fertilisation) is a 'body' is stretching the limits of the definition to it's extremes. It also completely ignores chimera individuals. Indeed - the encyclopedia britannica defines a 'human body' as the physical substance of the human organism, composed of living cells and extracellular materials and organized into tissues, organs, and systems.\n \n That enough? Sinjin's link to the Sorites paradox seems appropriate reading.\n \n \nWe have the aged, middle aged, the young adults, the teenagers, the adolescents, the pre-schoolers, the toddlers, the babies, the newborns, those about to be born, those in the third trimester, those in the second trimester, those in the first trimester and those that were just recently created by fertilization of the egg.\n...those that are the egg and sperm pre-meeting... etc.\n As I have said before - the only event that takes place at conception is the creation of new DNA. The cells are alive both before and after the event - and a strip of DNA in a single cell does not correlate to an individual organism - both because one cell can become multiple organisms, and because a single organism can be made from multiple cells.",
