When one has to worry at all times about whether or not the government is monitoring what they do in an attempt to find suspicious and potentially subversive activity it greatly interferes with a free society. The fear that can be generated by such an invasive policy, or the belief in such a policy, would not only hinder development and advancements in technology, it could easily generate distrust of the government and resentment, which would eventually lead to the formation of anti-government extremists who would be all too willing to engage in a war against the government.\n \n The government has far more pressing matters of importance than monitoring the private everyday events of the people of the nation.",
