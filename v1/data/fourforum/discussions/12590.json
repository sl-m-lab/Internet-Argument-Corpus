   "First I would say this is only the start of incorporation. This ruling only applies in the states governed by the 9th. Circuit CoA, and bear in mind this was only a 3 judge panel ruling. The whole panel could revisit the issue if requested, and the case could still reach SCOTUS if one of the parties tries to take it that far. Here are my opinions on this ruling (any bold emphasis is added by me):\n \n The 9th. CoA was forced to bow before SCOTUS and declare the 2nd. Amendment RKBA is an individual right (and in the process it overruled its own &#8220;state&#8217;s right only&#8221; opinion in Hickman):\n \n To reach this argument on the merits, we must first decide whether Heller abrogated Hickman. It did. Hickman rested on our conclusion that the Second Amendment protects only a collective right; Heller squarely overruled such conclusion. See Heller, 128 S. Ct. at 2799 (&#8220;There seems to us no doubt, on the basis of both text and history, that the Second Amendment conferred an individual right to keep and bear arms.&#8221;). Thus the basis for Hickman&#8217;s holding has evaporated, and the opinion is clearly irreconcilable with Heller. In such circumstances, we consider our prior decision abrogated by higher authority.4 See Miller v. Gammie, 335 F.3d 889, 899- 900 (9th Cir. 2003) (en banc). P8-9\n \n The Court then went on to address the question of incorporation&#8212;and it correctly believed that Heller left his issue unresolved:\n \n The second obstacle facing the Nordykes is incorporation. That is, we must decide whether the Second Amendment applies to the states through the Fourteenth, a question that Heller explicitly left open. See 128 S. Ct. at 2813 n.23.P14\n \n The Court then correctly described the 14th Amendment incorporation concept of &#8220;substantive due process.&#8221; \n \n The Fourteenth Amendment bars &#8220;any State [from] depriv[ing] any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.&#8221; U.S. Const. amend. XIV, \u00a7 1. Under the doctrine known as substantive due process, this Clause &#8220;guarantees more than fair process, and the &#8216;liberty&#8217; it protects includes more than the absence of physical restraint.&#8221; Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 719 (1997). In this conception, due process encompasses certain &#8220;fundamental&#8221; rights. Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 301-302 (1993). Selective incorporation is a species of substantive due process, in which the rights the Due Process Clause protects include some of the substantive rights enumerated in the first eight amendments to the Constitution. P15\n \n There is a difference between &#8220;substantive due process&#8221; (used for creating unstated rights&#8212;like abortion, for example&#8212;and then incorporating them against the states) and &#8220;selective incorporation&#8221; (describing the piecemeal incorporation of the written rights in the BoR against the states) But both require the incorporated right to be &#8220;fundamental&#8221;:\n \n Both selective incorporation and substantive due process require us to pose the same question: is a right so fundamental that the Due Process Clause guarantees it? Substantive due process addresses unenumerated rights; selective incorporation, by contrast, addresses enumerated\n rights. P17\n \n This case obviously involved &#8220;selective incorporation&#8221; of a right enumerated in the BoR. And so the question became: is the RKBA a &#8220;fundamental&#8221; right. Or, to put it another way, is the right &#8220;deeply rooted in this Nation&#8217;s history and tradition?&#8221;: \n \n To summarize, our task is to determine whether the right to keep and bear arms ranks as fundamental, meaning &#8220;necessary to an Anglo-American regime of ordered liberty.&#8221; Duncan, 391 U.S. at 149 n.14 (emphasis added). If it does, then the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates it. This culturally specific inquiry compels us to determine whether the right is &#8220;deeply rooted in this Nation&#8217;s history and tradition.&#8221; Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 721 (internal quotation marks and\n citation omitted). P27\n \n There follows a lengthy discussion of why the 2nd. Amendment RKBA was &#8220;deeply rooted in the Nation&#8217;s history and tradition.&#8221; I believe this analysis is a triumph for Stephen Halbrook, who is the nation&#8217;s pre-eminent 2nd. Amendment legal scholar (he also filed a brief in this case). A large number of the historical citations in this analysis were adopted from his research on the subject. It is worth reading. In any event, after conducting this history lesson, the Court said the following of the County&#8217;s attempt to answer it:\n \n The County does little to refute this powerful evidence that the right to bear arms is deeply rooted in the history and tradition of the Republic, a right Americans considered fundamental at the Founding and thereafter. The County instead argues that the states, in the exercise of their police power, are the instrumentalities of the right of self-defense at the heart of the Second Amendment. This argument merely rephrases the collective rights argument the Supreme Court rejected in Heller. Indeed, one need only consider other constitutional rights to see the poverty of this contention. State police power also covers, for instance, some of the conduct the First Amendment protects, but that does not deny individuals the right to assert First Amendment rights against the states. P29\n \n And so the Court concludes the right is fundamental and must be incorporated against the states:\n \n We therefore conclude that the right to keep and bear arms is &#8220;deeply rooted in this Nation&#8217;s history and tradition.&#8221; Colonial revolutionaries, the Founders, and a host of commentators and lawmakers living during the first one hundred years of the Republic all insisted on the fundamental nature of the right. It has long been regarded as the &#8220;true palladium of liberty.&#8221; Colonists relied on it to assert and to win their independence, and the victorious Union sought to prevent a recalcitrant South from abridging it less than a century later. The crucial role this deeply rooted right has played in our birth and history compels us to recognize that it is indeed fundamental, that it is necessary to the Anglo-American conception of ordered liberty that we have inherited.17 We are therefore persuaded that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the Second Amendment and applies it against the states and local governments.P30\n \n Now here is why the statute was nevertheless held to be constitutional. The court correctly noted that when SCOTUS decided Heller it gave little guidance as to which test should be applied for challenging laws which might infringe upon the right. The court noted that SCOTUS avoided the &#8220;which test do we use&#8221; question by simply stating that D.C.&#8217;s law was so restrictive it was unconstitutional no matter which test you apply. The court did find guidance in SCOTUS focus on the core self-defense right of having guns in the home:\n \n Again, we begin with Heller, which did not announce any standard of review, though it precluded rational basis review as an insufficient protection for a specifically enumerated right.19 See Heller, 128 S. Ct. at 2817 n.27. Rather than insist on a standard of review at the outset, the Heller Court evaluated the regulation at issue against the kind of conduct the Second Amendment protected from infringement. The Court began its analysis of the District of Columbia&#8217;s law by noting what activity the law covered: &#8220;the law totally bans handgun possession in the home. It also requires that any lawful firearm in the home be disassembled or bound by a trigger lock at all times, rendering it inoperable.&#8221; Id. at 2817 (emphases added). Next, the Court connected the statute&#8217;s operation to the conduct the Second Amendment protects: &#8220;the inherent right of self-defense has been central to the Second Amendment right. The handgun ban amounts to a prohibition of an entire class of &#8216;arms&#8217; that is overwhelmingly chosen by American society for that lawful purpose.&#8221; Id. It was thus the statute&#8217;s burdens on effective self-defense that implicated the Second Amendment. More particularly, Heller noted that the &#8220;prohibition extends . . . to the home, where the need for defense of self, family, and property is most acute.&#8221; Id. For the Court, this meant that, no matter the intensity of constitutional scrutiny, the District&#8217;s law could not survive. Heller tells us that the Second Amendment&#8217;s guarantee revolves around armed self-defense. If laws make such self-defense impossible in the most crucial place&#8212;the home &#8212;by rendering firearms useless, then they violate the Constitution. P32\n \n The court also noted SCOTUS said in Heller that guns can still be prohibited from &#8220;sensitive places&#8221; like &#8220;schools&#8221; and &#8220;government buildings,&#8221; and the court stated the locations specified in the County&#8217;s ordinance were similar: \n \n The County argues that its Ordinance merely forbids the carrying of firearms in sensitive places, which includes the Alameda County fairgrounds and other County property. The Nordykes object that the County has provided no way to determine what constitutes a &#8220;sensitive place.&#8221; But neither did Heller; Second Amendment law remains in its infancy. The Court listed schools and government buildings as examples, presumably because possessing firearms in such places risks harm to great numbers of defenseless people (e.g., children). Along the same lines, we notice that government buildings and schools are important to government functioning&#8230;.Although Heller does not provide much guidance, the open, public spaces the County&#8217;s Ordinance covers fit comfortably within the same category as schools and government buildings. P33\n \n But I think for the Court the more crucial question was whether the challenged law presented an issue of the government actively infringing the right&#8212;or an issue of merely the government&#8217;s refusal to encourage the exercise of the right. Look at how the court addressed the issue with reference to other rights: \n \n The Court has also held that the government need not fund abortions, even though women have a substantive due process right to obtain them. See Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297, 315-16 (1980). In Harris, the Court drew a crucial distinction between government interference with activity the Constitution protects and the government&#8217;s decision not to encourage, to facilitate, or to partake in such activity. &#8220;Although the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause affords protection against unwarranted government interference with freedom of choice in the context of certain personal decisions,&#8221; Harris declared, &#8220;it does not confer an entitlement to such funds as may be necessary to realize all the advantages of that freedom.&#8221; Id. at 317-18.21 If we apply these principles here, we conclude that although the Second Amendment, applied through the Due Process Clause, protects a right to keep and bear arms for individual self-defense, it does not contain an entitlement to bring guns onto government property. P33\n \n The difference between the two issues is crucial to this Court. Heller&#8217;s D.C. law dealt with an active infringement of the individual right in the most private of all places&#8212;the home. By contrast, the court felt this case dealt only with the government&#8217;s refusal to encourage participation or exercise of the right by refusing to make a government owned public venue available for the exercise of the right. The first instance is an unconstitutional infringement, the second, according to this court, is merely an exercise of legitimate government authority to adopt a policy declaring it does not want to subsidize the right by providing the venue for it. As the court ultimately held:\n \n To summarize: the Ordinance does not meaningfully impede the ability of individuals to defend themselves in their homes with usable firearms, the core of the right as Heller analyzed it. The Ordinance falls on the lawful side of the division, familiar from other areas of substantive due process doctrine, between unconstitutional interference with individual rights and permissible government nonfacilitation of their exercise. Finally, prohibiting firearm possession on municipal property fits within the exception from the Second Amendment for &#8220;sensitive places&#8221; that Heller recognized. These considerations compel us to conclude that the Second Amendment does not invalidate the specific Ordinance before us. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Nordykes leave to amend their complaint to add a Second Amendment claim that would have been futile. P33\n \n And this is the rub. I think the ban in this case was an example of very bad and prejudiced public policy, but just because I disagree with the policy and would vote against it does not make it unconstitutional. \n \n Incorporation was really inevitable once the right was declared to be individual. I did not expect the 9th. to be the first circuit to do so, especially given its past open hostility to the individual right interpretation. But done is done, and it remains to be seen whether this case would get to SCOTUS, or, if not, how the other circuits tackle the issue. It is a very good opinion for gun rights supporters, and a definite stick in the eye to the Brady Campaign. I am troubled, however, that we still have no solid framework for determining which test will be used to consider the constitutionality laws that do reach into the protection offered by the 2nd. Amendment. \n \n ---\n \n The issue, however, is not whether court rules are &#8220;mutable&#8221;; they assuredly are. It is not whether, in the light of &#8220;various circumstances,&#8221; they can be &#8220;modifi[ed]&#8221;; they assuredly can. The issue is whether, as mutated and modified, they must make sense. The requirement that they do so is the only thing that prevents this Court from being some sort of nine-headed Caesar, giving thumbs-up or thumbs-down to whatever outcome, case by case, suits or offends its collective fancy.

   "Great analysis Bryan and yes you are correct. This doesn't mean all the gun laws in place are invalidated, BUT it does provide a basis for determining whether some gun laws are unconstitutional now that incorporation has been affirmed by the 9th. My prediction is (in California)\n \n Unsafe firearm roster (basically any gun not on the list is banned for commercial sale) will be struck down\n Assault Weapons ban struck down as well as magazine ban struck down (can't do much if the magazine is not available)\n \n Things I think will hold:\n \n Registration of handguns\n Gun lock requirements\n Handgun licensing\n \n Things I think can go either way:\n CCW \n \n Still, IMHO this a heck of a lot better than it was before (for pro-gunners that is.)",
