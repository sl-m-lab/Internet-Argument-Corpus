   "The thuggish Brownshirts Roberts, Alito, Thomas and Kennedy, led by Gang Big Boss Scalia:\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/16/opinion/16fri1.html\n \n June 16, 2006\n Editorial\n The Don't-Bother-to-Knock Rule \n The Supreme Court yesterday substantially diminished Americans' right to privacy in their own homes. The rule that police officers must \"knock and announce\" themselves before entering a private home is a venerable one, and a well-established part of Fourth Amendment law. But President Bush's two recent Supreme Court appointments have now provided the votes for a 5-4 decision eviscerating this rule.\n \n This decision should offend anyone, liberal or conservative, who worries about the privacy rights of ordinary Americans. \n \n The case arose out of the search of Booker T. Hudson's home in Detroit in 1998. The police announced themselves but did not knock, and after waiting a few seconds, entered his home and seized drugs and a gun. There is no dispute that the search violated the knock-and-announce rule.\n \n The question in the case was what to do about it. Mr. Hudson wanted the evidence excluded at his trial. That is precisely what should have happened. Since 1914, the Supreme Court has held that, except in rare circumstances, evidence seized in violation of the Constitution cannot be used. The exclusionary rule has sometimes been criticized for allowing criminals to go free just because of police error. But as the court itself recognized in that 1914 case, if this type of evidence were admissible, the Fourth Amendment \"might as well be stricken.\"\n \n The court ruled yesterday that the evidence could be used against Mr. Hudson. Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the majority, argued that even if police officers did not have to fear losing a case if they disobeyed the knock-and-announce rule, the subjects of improper searches could still bring civil lawsuits to challenge them. But as the dissenters rightly pointed out, there is little chance that such suits would keep the police in line. Justice Scalia was also far too dismissive of the important privacy rights at stake, which he essentially reduced to \"the right not to be intruded upon in one's nightclothes.\" Justice Stephen Breyer noted in dissent that even a century ago the court recognized that when the police barge into a house unannounced, it is an assault on \"the sanctity of a man's home and the privacies of life.\"\n \n If Justice Sandra Day O'Connor had stayed on the court, this case might well have come out the other way. For those who worry that Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito will take the court in a radically conservative direction, it is sobering how easily the majority tossed aside a principle that traces back to 13th-century Britain, and a legal doctrine that dates to 1914, to let the government invade people's homes.",

The ACLU is representing the homeowner, Booker T. Hudson. \n \n \"It is undisputed that the police violated the Fourth Amendment by barging into Mr. Hudson's home without knocking and announcing,\" said David A. Moran, an Assistant Professor at Wayne State University Law School and the ACLU cooperating attorney who will argue the case before the Court. \"The question is whether evidence should be suppressed in order to deter the police from violating the knock and announce requirement.\" \n \n The ACLU said that Detroit police broke into Hudson's home without knocking and announcing, as required by law, in 2000. Once inside, the police found a small quantity of drugs and arrested Hudson for possession, which caused him to be placed on probation for 18 months. Despite the knock and announce violation, Hudson's motion to suppress the evidence found in his home was denied because of a 1999 Michigan Supreme Court ruling that evidence found after such a violation was not subject to suppression. \n \n However, the ACLU noted that in a 1995 U.S. Supreme Court opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas writing for the Court, stressed that the knock and announce requirement protects the dignity of residents by allowing them a reasonable time to make themselves presentable before the police enter, and also protects private property by allowing a resident an opportunity to open his or her door instead of having the doors destroyed by a police battering ram.\n",

Such ''shock and awe'' entries increase danger to innocent people. \n \n In 1995, the Supreme Court unanimously held that no-knock warrants are allowed only when occupants may be armed or evidence may be easily destroyed. Unfortunately, judges rubber-stamp no-knock requests in drug cases. \n \n Before such warrants are issued, judges should closely question confidential informants and require the police to find corroborating evidence. Judges should also compel the police to conduct surveillance to determine whether children or the elderly are on the premises. \n \n Recent police reforms after Ms. Spruill's death do not restrict the police in seeking no-knock warrants. Judges must impose those limits. \n \n RONALD L. KUBY \n New York, June 13, 2003\nThis case may have been a compelling reason for Justice Thomas' decision re \"no knock\" warrants.",

They ruled that evidence collected contrary to the 4th ammendment, that is, evidence illegally collected in direct contradiction to your consitutional rights, is still admissible in court. \n \n They did not strike a little thing like knock and announce, they used a wide brush to destroy a huge swath of rights traditionally covered under the fourth ammendment.\n \n In reading the ruling, it is refreshing to see that at least the justices are honest in their ruling. They don't try to pass this off a legal. They simply admit that they lack the strength of charachter to let a bad guy go just because his rights were violated. I can certainly admit it would be hard as a judge to watch somebody who is guilty as sin walk out the door because the cops violated is rights. In theroy, that is the system we are supposed to live under. \"Guilty\" in the US is not supposed to have anything to do with whether you did it or not, but rather if they can PROVE you did it in a court of law without violating your rights.\n \n On the up side, my predictions about scalia turned out to be right on. The guy LOVES authority. Why does knock and annoucne essentially need no enforcement? \"Increasing professionalism of police agencies\".

You could think of it this way: If you pulled over a car for speeding (lets say the officer thought it was 30mph over) and it turns out they weren't speeding (radar gun was messed up lets say) and you searched their car because going 30mph over means you will probably get your car searched and you find drugs...the search is not going to be invalid and thus evidence is gone.

It was a rule at common law that before an officer could break and enter he must give notice of his office, authority, and purpose and must in effect be refused admittance, 156 and until recently this has been a statutory requirement in the federal system 157 and generally in the States. In Ker v. California, 158 the Court considered the rule of announcement as a constitutional requirement, although a majority there found circumstances justifying entry without announcement. In Wilson v. Arkansas, Supp.2 the Court determined that the common law ''knock and announce'' rule is an element of the Fourth Amendment reasonableness inquiry. The rule does not, however, require announcement under all circumstances. The presumption in favor of announcement yields under various circumstances, including those posing a threat of physical violence to officers, those in which a prisoner has escaped and taken refuge in his dwelling, and those in which officers have reason to believe that destruction of evidence is likely. Recent federal laws providing for the issuance of warrants authorizing in certain circumstances ''no-knock'' entries to execute warrants will no doubt present the Court with opportunities to explore the configurations of the rule of announcement. 159 A statute regulating the expiration of a warrant and issuance of another ''should be liberally construed in favor of the individual.'' 160 Similarly, inasmuch as the existence of probable cause must be established by fresh facts, so the execution of the warrant should be done in timely fashion so as to ensure so far as possible the continued existence of probable cause. 161 ~ \n \n The rule of announcement, not probably cause (without which there would be no warrant) is the issue. Exceptions to no-knock entries have become the norm. \n \n Just as in any police state, people's rights have been suborned to a need perceived by government. Federal policy and supporting constitutional interpretations and lack of seem to be chopping democracy into totally manageable pieces. Not exactly ideal for all individuals including innocents, but considering the severity of US social problems and a declining economy, I can understand the concept from political and LE viewpoints. Self-serving rather than problem solution from that viewpoint would be my opinion. \n \n That's also a major reason why upscale rural property values in counties without metropolitan cities and few federal agencies with elected county sheriffs have gone crazy in value in spite of the softening real estate market. Sorry for the tangent, it is an important component in recognizing the ramifications of police state policies as the US working middle class is replaced by expansion of government policy and subsequent resources designed to combat social and other problems, not solve them.",

Scalia has just done what he's railed at others for doing. Good thing for him he's not elected, or he might have to answer for his hypocracy.\n\n \n \n Look a little closer. The constitution was never viewed as a \"living\" document. It was always viewed as a static document and only strictly originalist interpetation was accepted until following WWII. Thomas Jefferson said:\n \n \nOn every question of construction (of the Constitution) let us carry ourselves back to the time when the Constitution was adopted, recollect the spirit manifested in the debates, and instead of trying what meaning may be squeezed out of the text, or invented against it, conform to the probable one in which it was passed.\n \n letter to William Johnson, June 12, 1823, The Complete Jefferson, p322. \n\n \n The legal argument that went with this is the exact same one I have outlined here. If you begin interpeting the constituiton in changing ways and depart from the conservative originalist view, you have effectively turned it into toilet paper. A constitution cannot POSSIBLY have its intended effect if the meaning of it is in a constant state of flux. \n \n A lot of folks, including Scalia, claim to be originalists bat are CERTAINLY NOT. Scalia has said:\n \n \n\"Don't think the originalist interpretation constrains you. To the contrary. My Constitution is a very flexible Constitution. You want a right to abortion? Create it the way all rights are created in a democracy, pass a law. The death penalty? Pass a law. That's flexibility.\"\n\n \n While that is certainly flexibility...the kind of flexibility that leads to a \"living constituion\", that is certainly not a traditional originalist view. A traditional originalist view would immediatly recognize that the federal government does not have the power to grant a \"right\" to abortion, nor even to authorize it on a nationwide level. The powers of the federal government are fairly limited. Abortion certainly does not fall within those powers and thus is an issue for the states. \n \n The sad thing is that the Federalists turned out to be right. The federalist argued AGAINST a bill of rights. They did not argue agaunst it because they disagreed that we had natural rights, they disagreed with its inclusion becuase they aregued that the day may come when the ONLY concrete rights recognized by our government and our courts are those listed in the bill of rights. The federalists aregued that the ONLY POWERS the federal government has are clearly laid out in the text of the constitution itself, and that as long as they were not allowed to expand those powers, there was absolutly no possibility of the federal government becoming a tool of oppression.\n \n Their fears have certainly been borne out. Instead of the limit on powers in the body of the constitution being viewed as the limits of the governments power, the bill of rights has become the limiting factor which has allowed greatly expanded federal power. Now that the federal governemtn has essentially grabbed every bit of power that they can without infringing too much on the bill of rights, they are starting to snipe at the bill of rights as well.",
