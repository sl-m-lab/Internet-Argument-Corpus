   "OK, first of all I'd like to thank Evan for agreeing to this debate, billsco for setting up this debate, and daewoo for agreeing to judge this debate. Now down to business.\n \n I am trying to prove here that \"Flag Burning is Constitutionally protected as free speech.\". My primary source will be the first amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America. \n \n \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\" - First amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America\n \n I hope all observing will accept my cutting this down to a manageable size using only the words applicable to my case.\n \n \"Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech,...or the right of the people peaceably to assemble\"\n \n Hopefully you will all agree that I have not taken any meaning out of the first amendment, only taken out the unnecessary parts to this debate.\n \n Now how that applies to flag burning:\n \n I don't think anyone will disagree that the people assembling to do the flag burning is totally legal, but that it is only the act of burning the flag that is questionable. So the question comes down to what is meant by freedom of speech.\n \n First of all I think the words \"abridging the freedom\" are pretty clear that if something is classified as free speech, any law even limiting that speech is unconstitutional.\n \n Now there are many different interpretations of what speech is. I like to go to the dictionary for my first definition. I'm not going to paste the whole thing here but here's the link to the dictionary.com definition of speech: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/speech\n \n From the reading of the literal definition of speech, it's pretty obvious that burning a flag isn't free speech. The closest definition for speech relating to flag burning is this definition from the above link:\n \n \"The faculty or act of expressing thoughts, feelings, or perceptions by the articulation of words.\"\n \n Flag burning definitely falls under the first part, but falls at the use of the phrase \"by the articulation of words\".\n \n But even more important than the literal definition is the meaning that was meant by the authors. There are many places to learn this. One is the rest of the Constitution, and the principles there. Another is the authors' outside writings, and another is the history behind the times.\n \n First I'm going to talk about the history, I'll give a brief overview. Basically the early settlers were upset about the power of the English government. So they drafted the Articles of Confederation. This was a total disaster, and gave the federal government way too little power, almost creating 13 different countries. So they got together and drafted the Constitution. It originally was not going to include the Bill of Rights. There was an argument whether or not to include the Bill of Rights, because many argued that it was redundant and could be interpreted as limitations on rights. Thus to show that this was not the case, Amendments IX and X were added. So the first amendment, along with the rest of the Bill of Rights, are meant as limitations on the government, but not an absolute definition of where the government's power ends.\n \n So basically it is very clear that the government may definitely not abridge vocal and written speech, but symbolic speech such as burning the flag is still up in the air.\n \n The next part to consider is the actual Constitution itself. The layout is interesting. It lays out what each branch of government can do. What the President can do, the Congress can do, and what the Courts can do. Nowhere is there a section on the people. That is because any power not given to the government is the right of the people.\n \n Anyone familiar with the Constitution knows about Article I, Section 8. It is a list of all the powers Congress has. Nowhere will you find anything even similar to \"preventing people from being offended\" or anything of that nature. Now that means that by Amendment X, flag burning is either a state issue, or a right reserved to the people. Now I'm sure my opponent will insist that this is a State's right because of this very phrase, but let's look closer.\n \n Let's take a look at the format of the bill of rights as a whole. It's very well structured and thought out. First it gives the right to think and say whatever you want and complain to the government about it. Next it gives you the means to enforce this, and defend against a corrupt government. Next it continues on the theme of weapons prohibiting the government from quartering soldiers in a time of peace. This almost should be Amendment 2b, the second amendment dealing with being able to protect your rights, and the third denying the government from using soldiers to infringe on your rights. The 4th continues on the theme of the government using force against citizens on their property. The 5th grants rights once you have already been arrested. The 6th continues on that thought protecting the rights of those arrested in a trial. The 7th is also on that topic, protecting the right of trial by jury to prevent a government-appointed judge from corrupting the legal system. The 8th is also similar, forcing the government to allow you to reasonably post bail, and prevent cruel and unusual punishment against those already been arrested.\n \n I've already covered the 9th and 10th. So what does that say about the 1st amendment? Where does it fit in? It protects all the rights that everyone should have with activities not involving force. It allows you to say whatever you want, think whatever you want, and to disagree with the government. This makes it even more clear that it is not just a simply protection against verbal and written works. The 1st amendment is protecting very broad rights, just as the other 9 do. The right to bear arms is general about guns, and so is the 1st. Any religion is allowed to be practiced, and a petition can be presented to the Government. So would my opponent like to assume that the one phrase, \"freedom of speech\" is to be taken literally? Does he think that the framers of the Constitution would address rights in general, and the rights to think, say, and be wherever they want, yet not include the right to disagree in non-verbal ways? Remember, the bill of rights was about rights being granted to the people, and not in any way meant to be exclusive. Yet my opponent would have us think that one phrase be taken literally?\n \n Now I'd like to step back a bit and address the simple act of flag burning. Everyone knows what it means, it means the person burning it is upset with the government of the United States. It is probably the most offensive way to express this displeasure. Which is why it should be considered free speech. If the first amendment is about anything, it is about the right to think, say, or write anything you want, without regard to the government or others disliking it. That is made clear by the phrase \"to petition the Government for a redress of grievances\". These are rights of the people, that the government can't even abridge. Now that I've established that non-verbal, non-written speech is also protected by the first amendment, you will see that there is no way around the fact that states have no power to ban flag burning. If it is burned on someone else's property there could be a problem. But as long as the flag is the property of the person burning it, and it is on their property or public property, the government has no power to deny someone the right of doing what they want to their property. They are even downright told not to in the first amendment.\n \n I am not sure the exact defense my opponent will use, so I would like to wait for my opponent to respond before going into more detail rebutting an argument and finding out that he agrees with me on that point. So at this point I will step back, sit down, and wait for my opponent to speak. Evan, the floor's yours.",

   "I would like to personally thank Billsco for setting up this debate, and Daewoo for agreeing to judge the debate. I would also like to thank Zachvac for giving me this new opportunity. I've never done anything like this so it should be interesting. \n \n I see a slight problem. It would appear that Zachvac is an American citizen, where as I am a Canadian citizen. Considering we are both from democratic, free, peaceful countries who value freedoms I trust that the legislation I refer to will be considered just as credible and respectable as the legislation he refers to. \n \n Alright, let's get this party started. \n \n Like America guarantees the Freedoms of Speech through the first amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America, Canada guarantees these very same freedoms though section 2 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. \n \n \"Everyone has the following fundamental freedoms: ...\n b) Freedoms of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communications.\n c) Freedoms of peaceful assembly...\" Charter of Rights\n \n Now, before I go any further I would like to say that I know that the majority of the people who are burning the flag are probably burning it in protest of a particular policy of the current government. They have every right to protest that government and say what ever they want about their policies. However, even though these people feel that burning the flag of the country is a reasonable way to state their believes, it is not. People who burn the flag are disrespectful of every soldier, the founding fathers and the very spirit of that country. Unless the government at the time has hijacked the country and is purposefully killing innocent citizens, creating an authoritarian government and destroying democracy and freedom the flag should not be burned. Even with that said, I realise that that is a matter of opinion and even though I value that opinion very dearly the rest of you may not see the situation the same way I do. \n \n That is why I propose to use legislation and case law to suggest that the people of a country can be absolutely free and still be subject to regulation. \n \n \"The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society\". Section 1, Charter of Rights. \n \n This section outlines two different but important aspects of the Charter; first off, it constitutionally guarantees the rights and freedoms, and secondly it sets up criteria for which limitations of these rights and freedoms can be measured. In order to impose such limitations of such fundamental freedoms we must establish reasonable justification and the limitation must establish an interest for the safety of the individual and society. This is also found in American legislation. The very fact that they have laws suggests that the people can not do what ever they feel like, no matter how you cut it there will always be limitations on your actions. \n \n In section 2 of the Charter of Rights, R v. Lucas states that expression which is communicated in a violent form is not protected under this act.\n \n Also in section 2, Retail, Wholesale & department Union, Local 580 v. Dolphin Delivery Ltd states that while picketers are protected under this section they are not protected against protesting acts which are accompanied by acts of threats of violence, disruption of property, assault or other unlawful conduct.\n \n Now I know what you are saying. You're asking yourselves how burning the flag could be a form of violence. Well the dictionary defines violence as \"Physical force exerted for the purpose of violating, damaging, or abusing: crimes of violence\". Is burning the flag a crime of violence? I would strongly say yes as it does cause the damage of property. \n \n I used the same dictionary source as my opponent http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/violence \n \n I would like to refer to section 433 of the Criminal Code of Canada, arson. \n \"Every person who ntentionally or recklessly causes damage by fire or explosion to property, whether or not that person owns the property, is guilty... where the person knows that or is reckless with respect to whether the property is inhabited or occupied\"\n \n I would like to draw your attention to elements of this offence. First off the statement, \"every one who intentionally... causes damage by fire\" is pretty self comparable. When you burn the flag you are doing by fire and it is intentional. Secondly the very word \"property\" means, as defined in the Criminal Code sec. 428, \"real or personal corporeal property\". Obviously this would include a flag. Thirdly the statement, \"whether or not that person owns the property\", clearly states that ownership is not an issue and therefore the destruction of your own property can be considered violent and arson. Fourthly the statement \"where the person knows ... the property is inhabited or occupied\" clearly states that this action is prohibited in the presence of the public, in order to ensure safety and therefore is not a reasonable form of protest, because after all what's the point of protest if there's no one to observer it. Fifthly the word \"recklessness\" means that the person realises the risk and ignores it, as defined in sec. 433, R v. Sansregret, of the Criminal Code. In order to be burning the flag in effective protest the action would have to be in an area where there would be a number of people; in order to get the political message across, because of this the protester(s) would have to accept the risk, which would constitute arson. And lastly, (and my favourite part by the way) the word \"guilty\", if the offence contains all of these elements it is arson; an indictable offence where the accused is liable to imprisonment for life. As I have shown, the burning of a flag in protest is arson.\n You will also notice that there is no reference to whether the property must be personal or public. \n \n Understandably, this is Canadian law; however, last I checked the United States does have an offence of arson which is a felony. \n \n I feel that the word \"recklessness\" and the risks involved in flag burning needs further discussion. Protesting and protesters are a group of emotional people out fighting for what they believe. The very nature of a protest is erratic and sometimes, as we've all see, unpredictable. To introduce something like fire into this situation can prove to be very dangerous to the people and property. This is why it is considered reckless. Even if nothing happens and everyone remains unharmed it is still considered an offence because of the reckless actions being taken. Not allowing the burning of a flag and arresting those who do out of protest is being proactive to insure public safety. \n \n The people can say what ever they wish, it's their fundamental right to do so, and in some occasion I would say it's their duty. However, both the American Constitution, through the first amendment, and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, through section 2, outlines that citizens are free to peaceful association. The destruction of property, by fire; which is an element which can get out of control and is unpredictable, is not peaceful. Therefore, flag burning is not protected under the American or Canadian constitution because of its destructive nature. \n \n Although, the constitution may be designed to limit the actions of government on the citizens of that particular country laws are designed to limit the actions of the people for their protection. And that is where the regulations of the people can be found. Yes the people deserve their freedoms and rights, but only to a degree where they can not impose on another's freedoms. Flag burning in protest presents this danger. That is why it is not constitutionally protected under the fundamental rights.\n \n Zachvac, you're up.",

   "I see a slight problem. It would appear that Zachvac is an American citizen, where as I am a Canadian citizen. Considering we are both from democratic, free, peaceful countries who value freedoms I trust that the legislation I refer to will be considered just as credible and respectable as the legislation he refers to. \n \n\n Well this is a bit of a problem. I assumed that we were talking about the Constitutionality of flag burning in the United States. The discussion in the government forum was discussing the first amendment of the US Constitution. I assumed that you had lived in the United States before and were familiar with at least the US Constitution. If Evan really doesn't have enough knowledge of the US Constitution than I ask him to agree to a draw, as we were not clear on the terms of the debate, but if he feels he can continue the debate that's fine too. Obviously I am using exclusively the US Constitution in my argument and have absolutely no knowledge of Canada. I'll try to address your first post as best I can, but some of my answers may simply be that the US is different from Canada in that respect.\n \n So without further ado...\n \n \n\n Like America guarantees the Freedoms of Speech through the first amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America, Canada guarantees these very same freedoms though section 2 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. \n \n \"Everyone has the following fundamental freedoms: ...\n b) Freedoms of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communications.\n c) Freedoms of peaceful assembly...\" Charter of Rights\n \n\n \n I note that Canada goes even further than the US. It specifically guarantees the freedom of expression, which is beyond only speech.\n \n Since we both seem to accept dictionary.com as being generally unbiased in its definitions I'll continue to use it. Here's the applicable definition for expression:\n \n \"The outward manifestation of a mood or a disposition: My tears are an expression of my grief.\"\n \n If tears can be expression, it is not that big of a stretch to say that burning a flag does as well. You've agreed that it is to express an opinion, and express is simply the verb form of expression.\n \n \n\n Now, before I go any further I would like to say that I know that the majority of the people who are burning the flag are probably burning it in protest of a particular policy of the current government. They have every right to protest that government and say what ever they want about their policies. However, even though these people feel that burning the flag of the country is a reasonable way to state their believes, it is not. \n \n\n This is a totally unfounded claim, and totally irrelevant to the debate. First off I challenge you to find anywhere, US or Canadian Constitution, where it grants only the right of reasonable speech or expression. Furthermore you have not shown why it is not a reasonable way to state their beliefs.\n \n \n\n People who burn the flag are disrespectful of every soldier, the founding fathers and the very spirit of that country. Unless the government at the time has hijacked the country and is purposefully killing innocent citizens, creating an authoritarian government and destroying democracy and freedom the flag should not be burned. Even with that said, I realise that that is a matter of opinion and even though I value that opinion very dearly the rest of you may not see the situation the same way I do. \n \n\n \n Again with the opinion words. It's irrelevant whether or not it should be burned, it's whether it is a Constitutional right. Looking at rights granted by the American or Canadian government, I don't see exceptions in there, they are unrestricted rights granted to the citizens. You are arguing here that it is disrespectful and shouldn't happen, but until you can find the applicable law taking away the right to be disrespectful, this is pure opinion.\n \n \n\n \"The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society\". Section 1, Charter of Rights. \n \n\n Unfortunately, this is where the difference lies between the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the United States Constitution. The US Constitution provides unrestricted rights with phrases such as \"no law abridging\" and \"shall not be in infringed\". The framers of the US Constitution realized that whenever there are standards set such as \"reasonable\" and leaving them up to the government to interpret, there will be a problem with rights given to the people. So at any point in Canada they could simply say \"it's not reasonable to express any anti-government thoughts\" and justify it by saying you are aiding the enemy (it's already been tried in the US by a few people). But why they do it is irrelevant. When a word such as reasonable is left defending one of the most important rights in a Democracy, there is a big problem. Thankfully, no such word exists in the first amendment to the US Constitution.\n \n \n\n This section outlines two different but important aspects of the Charter; first off, it constitutionally guarantees the rights and freedoms, and secondly it sets up criteria for which limitations of these rights and freedoms can be measured. In order to impose such limitations of such fundamental freedoms we must establish reasonable justification and the limitation must establish an interest for the safety of the individual and society. This is also found in American legislation. The very fact that they have laws suggests that the people can not do what ever they feel like, no matter how you cut it there will always be limitations on your actions. \n \n\n There are always limitations on ACTIONS. But Constitutional rights trump all other laws. That's why here in the US we need 2/3 of both houses of Congress and 3/4 of the citizens to ratify a flag-burning amendment, rather than simply 50%+1 of each house and the President's signature (or 2/3 of both houses without a signature). The text of the first amendment is such that there are not restrictions on these rights, and certainly not limits justified because some people are offended or because there need to be reasonable limits. The US Constitution is granting a right. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms seems to be more of a compromise. We'll give you the right to expression, but it must be reasonable. etc.\n \n \n \n\n In section 2 of the Charter of Rights, R v. Lucas states that expression which is communicated in a violent form is not protected under this act.\n \n Also in section 2, Retail, Wholesale & department Union, Local 580 v. Dolphin Delivery Ltd states that while picketers are protected under this section they are not protected against protesting acts which are accompanied by acts of threats of violence, disruption of property, assault or other unlawful conduct.\n \n\n \n Which is similar to the United States again where threats and slander are not protected. But the reason for that is simple. Threats and slander are forms of harming an individual. So one is still held accountable for what is said in the speech or the ideas expressed. Threats are illegal. But burning a flag does no such thing. The worst harm it does is offend people. If the fire gets out of control and burns a house down they are still liable.\n \n \n \n\n Now I know what you are saying. You're asking yourselves how burning the flag could be a form of violence. Well the dictionary defines violence as \"Physical force exerted for the purpose of violating, damaging, or abusing: crimes of violence\". Is burning the flag a crime of violence? I would strongly say yes as it does cause the damage of property. \n \n\n Please don't go there. We all know what violence is and we all know that burning the flag is not violence unless it is to cause harm or destroy (another person's) property.\n \n \n By the definition, burning the flag is not violence. If this were the case getting your pants muddy could be considered violence.\n \n \n \n \n\n I would like to refer to section 433 of the Criminal Code of Canada, arson. \n \"Every person who ntentionally or recklessly causes damage by fire or explosion to property, whether or not that person owns the property, is guilty... where the person knows that or is reckless with respect to whether the property is inhabited or occupied\"\n \n\n Well it's a good thing google's there, because otherwise I would have taken your word that this actually conveyed the meaning of the code. Here is a link for all to see and I will reproduce, in full, Code 433 of the Criminal Code of Canada, relating to arson.\n \n \"Every person who intentionally or recklessly causes damage by fire or explosion to property, whether or not that person owns the property, is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for life where\n \n (a) the person knows that or is reckless with respect to whether the property is inhabited or occupied; or\n \n (b) the fire or explosion causes bodily harm to another person.\"\n \n Note that according to this definition of arson one must either violate a or b, and flag burning does neither. Burning the flag can be arson, but by it's own nature is not. If I burn the flag on my own property, being careful (thus not reckless) to make sure it doesn't spread, and it doesn't harm anyone, it is not, by the Canadian code, arson. I would assume the US applicable law is similar.\n \n \n \n \n\n I would like to draw your attention to elements of this offence. First off the statement, \"every one who intentionally... causes damage by fire\" is pretty self comparable. When you burn the flag you are doing by fire and it is intentional. Secondly the very word \"property\" means, as defined in the Criminal Code sec. 428, \"real or personal corporeal property\". Obviously this would include a flag. Thirdly the statement, \"whether or not that person owns the property\", clearly states that ownership is not an issue and therefore the destruction of your own property can be considered violent and arson.

And lastly, (and my favourite part by the way) the word \"guilty\", if the offence contains all of these elements it is arson; an indictable offence where the accused is liable to imprisonment for life. As I have shown, the burning of a flag in protest is arson.\n You will also notice that there is no reference to whether the property must be personal or public. \n \n\n This is irrelevant, because you ignored the fact that it must qualify under a or b to be considered arson.\n \n \n \n \n\n Understandably, this is Canadian law; however, last I checked the United States does have an offence of arson which is a felony. \n \n I feel that the word \"recklessness\" and the risks involved in flag burning needs further discussion. Protesting and protesters are a group of emotional people out fighting for what they believe. The very nature of a protest is erratic and sometimes, as we've all see, unpredictable. To introduce something like fire into this situation can prove to be very dangerous to the people and property. This is why it is considered reckless. Even if nothing happens and everyone remains unharmed it is still considered an offence because of the reckless actions being taken. Not allowing the burning of a flag and arresting those who do out of protest is being proactive to insure public safety. \n \n\n But by it's very nature, burning a flag in protest is not reckless. It's possible for people who wish to protest the government, to go out on a concrete or other non-flamable material, make sure no one is in the immediate vicinity, and peacefully burn the flag to signify the fact that everything the flag used to represent is now gone. That is a very powerful, and peaceful, form of expression burning the flag.\n \n \n \n \n \n\n The people can say what ever they wish, it's their fundamental right to do so, and in some occasion I would say it's their duty. However, both the American Constitution, through the first amendment, and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, through section 2, outlines that citizens are free to peaceful association. The destruction of property, by fire; which is an element which can get out of control and is unpredictable, is not peaceful. Therefore, flag burning is not protected under the American or Canadian constitution because of its destructive nature. \n \n\n You continue to ignore the fact that while it is possible for a flag burning to get out of control, in which case it would not be Constitutionally protected, it is not inherent of the very nature of flag burning. So you should not be arguing for flag burning in itself being illegal, but for violent, unpredictable, and reckless flag burnings.\n \n \n \n \n\n Although, the constitution may be designed to limit the actions of government on the citizens of that particular country laws are designed to limit the actions of the people for their protection.\n \n\n I am not knowledgeable of the Canadian Constitution, but for the US Constitution, it's meant to give the federal government power (and it doesn't have any power that the Constitution doesn't give it) and the bill of rights are just an assurance of what should be the case already. It is a confirmation that the government can't take away any of those rights, and amendments IX and X further show that the Rights aren't the only rights we have.\n \n \n \n \n\n And that is where the regulations of the people can be found. Yes the people deserve their freedoms and rights, but only to a degree where they can not impose on another's freedoms. Flag burning in protest presents this danger. That is why it is not constitutionally protected under the fundamental rights.\n \n Zachvac, you're up.\n\n \n You talk of what they deserve, this debate is about what's in the Constitution (I was referring to the US one) and what it means. But this does bring a quote to mind.\n \n Apparently there's no proof but it was thought to have originated from Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes. Here's a reference, http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=221629\n \n \"Your right to punch me ends at my nose\"\n \n Basically it is the principle of most US federal law. As long as there is no harm being done to anyone, it can not and should not be banned. As long as flag burning is done in a peaceful manner, there is no basis for banning it. Being offensive is not enough for something to be harmful. You seem to concede that point, as I see very little in this post about there being a Constitutional exception because something is offensive.\n \n \n To recap:\n I went through a logical progression about why, according to the US Constitution, flag burning is Constitutionally protected. In your first post, you bring up many irrelevant points, many having to do with the Canadian Constitution. Remember, since I'm the affirmative in this debate you have to refute my argument. Your job in this debate is not to prove that it isn't Constitutionally protected, but refute my argument that it is. There's a subtle but important difference there. Since my argument really had nothing to do with the Canadian Constitution, most of my argument was left unaddressed, and I will let it stand. It's still there in the first post, and if you wish to address those points you still have time and 3 more posts to go.\n \n Things I have accomplished in this post:\n \n 1. proven that according to the Canadian definition, flag burning is not arson\n \n 2. proven that flag burning can be done peacefully\n \n 3. proven that barring any other right being violated, the first amendment is an unrestricted right\n \n 4. combining 2 and 3 together, proven that flag burning is protected by the first amendment of the Constitution, affirming what I stated in my first post.\n \n Back to you Evan.",

   "Evan and zachvac,\n \n I believe in order to proceed, clarification of the resolution must be obtained.

   "Evan and zachvac,\n \n I believe in order to proceed, clarification of the resolution must be obtained. It's understandable in hindsight how this confusion resulted--the international makeup of the debaters--and underscores how important careful wording of the resolution from the beginning is. My apologies for not catching this before agreements were reached.\n \n It's my hope this debate can continue to a succesful conclusion.

Let me know what you think by posting to this thread.\n \n Thank you,\n \n billsco\n\n \n This is what I had in mind, and like I said if Evan has a problem with this I have no problem simply concluding this debate in a draw. Alternatively, since Evan seemed to assume Canadian law was important I'd have no problem restarting the debate, with my first post still standing of course. So it would be on him to make his \"first\" post in the debate. Or if he thinks he can simply continue with the new resolution but with the posts already made, that's fine too. I was just completely shocked when I read the response referring so much to Canada because I just assumed Constitution referred to the US Constitution. My fault, and hopefully we can resolve this.",

   "Alright, well you can go ahead and change the debate to \"flag burning is free speach under the US constitution\" if you wish. But i want a chance to repost my first post if its not being allowed, and i want a weeks time from the time this is resolved so that i can find and read the American criminal law, and the US constitution. \n \n I've got to tell ya though... im alittle disappointed that the Canadian constitution is not being give the same credibility as the US constitution, and is being looked at as being trivial esspically when courts aften look to internation law for interpritation, and clarification, from both countries.\n Also its to bad because im not going to get to show how Zachvac's last post was partly based on spin. \n \n But if you feel that the topic should be changed then by all means do what you wish.",

But if you can prove that international law applies to the US Constitution, that's fine. I don't think anyone wants to outlaw any mention of the Canadian Constitution, but you'll have to prove it applies to the US Constitution as well because that's what the main resolution was.",

   "Allow me to retire this debate. Evan visited 4Forums last night but didn't feel a need to grace us with an explanation. It's unfortunate in that this is an interesting topic. I'd be happy if someone else showed an interest in arguing the negative to the resolution. \n \n I've mentioned in the past that I wouldn't become involved in moderating debates unless both paticipants had at least one year experience in this forum. To date the record for me becoming involved in debates with johnny-come-lately's:\n \n Newcomers: 2\n billsco: 0\n \n I'm not going to say I won't try to coordinate a prospective debate again with a newbie. Who knows when a fresh face with one post appears and gives us a debate worthy of its name. I may be a bit more cynical however.\n \n My only wish is to encourage, not stifle, formal debates. There are at any time going on in the various forums a handful of topics which could be made more interesting, and more meaningful, if the combatants ramped it up to a formal debate level. Consider giving it a try.\n \n But as for this debate: Closed.",
