   "ethmi,\n \n From one of your previous posts:\n \n If you only teach them left wing opinions, they'll become left wing people. I think the students should learn their political opinions from their parents. Everyone on the local school board around here is left wing, and I doubt other school boards are much different. So what would the school board put in the cirriculum? Left wing opinions. If kids only get left wing opinions, then there will be an unequal balance of right wing to left wing in the future. For everyone on the forum, well, if that were so, then this forum wouldn't see much debate.\n \n Let's see now: \n 1. The teachers are lefties who \"indoctrinate\" their students\n and \n 2. the country has been very hard right lo these past 30 years.\n \n So then, for the country to be so hard right, then it must follow that students were NOT \"indoctrinated\" by their teachers. I suppose there's not much indoctrination going on in school, is there?\n \n Let's see now, today's kids were raised by parents who grew up in the liberal times of the '60's, so they were not hard righties. The teachers have had no measurable effect on their students.\n \n How are we so hard right?\n \n Must be the greatest snow job by politicians like RAYgun, Gingrich, et. al. who brought this nightmare on the country.\n \n Fortunately, change will begin on 1/21/09 when President Obama is sworn in.\n\n \n Change? What change? What specifically is going to change if Obama gets elected? I keep hearing his supporters talk about this \"hope\" and \"change\" yet every time I hear the man speak, he insults America and suggests a socialist agenda. Part of me actually hopes Obama gets elected, so you can see his idea of \"change.\"",
