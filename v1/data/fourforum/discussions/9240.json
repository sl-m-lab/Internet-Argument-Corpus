Guess which way.\n That Scotland's drive to live life separate from that of Great Britain is doomed to success. It's 'cause it's linked directly to Jewish plans of moving into a more ecologically and politically friendly place on the planet. Israeli desert can't be dream of one's life surely. And that endless sorting it out with the neighboring excessively militant Arabs can't but get on the most Jews' nerves. So, where to? Actually there have been several locations under consideration, including the Crimea and other paradise like places. \n The final decision is Scotland. Jews have been always welcomed here. There were historical times when the Scotch just worshiped the Jews and even identified themselves as Jews. Needless to say, there has been no anti-Semitism in Scotland so far, which is of utmost importance for Jews. Well, and the place of birth of the oldest Masonic lodge is the Scotch city of Musselburgh. Each Masonic lodge in Jewish perception is symbol of the Jewish temple. There's one more quite essential thing to add here. It's oil, lots of oil! So I am nearly sure that soon one more independent state will emerge on the political map of the world.

Why did they keep attacking when the liberty wasn't armed with weapons capable to shelling land targets? Why did they keep attacking after flying so close they could SEE the crew was Anglo-Saxon? Why did they keep attacking after numerous radio signals identifying who they were? The Israelis are not incompetent. This was a deliberate attack.\n \n \n3. How smart would a Jew be to engage the U.S. in an act of war?\n\n \n Pretty smart since they used unmarked planes and unmarked torpedo boats and they knew their target didn't carry anything significant enough to be a threat. A couple of .50 machine guns was basically it. \n \n \nDid this intelligence expose motive or end desire? Did they hope the U.S. would respond and annihilate them? Or does the intelligence suggest that the Jews thought they could take the U.S.?\n\n \n Does the term \"bring a ally into the war\" mean anything to you? By not using Israeli marked planes and boats, they could pin the attack on Egypt or another attacking Arab state, thereby putting the act of war on them causing the US to retaliate for the attack on their ship, thereby either opening another front or at least taking pressure off the Israeli forces.\n \n [qupte]5. Someone forgot to tell Ahmenijad that they would respond to anything with reason. He is already threatening a nuclear attack on Israel and doesn't have the means.[/quote]\n \n Someone (you) forgot to research that the talking head is a talking head. The president of Iran is largely a figure head. The Mullahs control the state and its military. What he says is irrelevant. You can count the amount of legislation passed by the past 3 Iranian presidencies (2 of which were reformists) on one hand. \n \n \nI project things as I see them. I don't care how they see things.\n\n \n Hence why you're wrong. How can you expect to defeat a enemy if you cannot even begin to understand them? Information is the key to all forms of warfare, one must know thyself as well as thy enemy. Projecting their actions without looking from their view is a surefire way to #### everything up. Why do think the CIA employs hundreds of analysts and historians who primarily look at how a specific group, country or person sees the world? For fun? For kicks and giggles? No. They do it because they need to know how the subject may react from their point of view. Your major problem here is your inability to put yourself in their shoes. What do THEY want, how will THEY achieve it, what do THEY want least? Not what YOU think they want, what YOU think how they will achieve it, what YOU think they want least. One MUST know thy enemy to defeat them. To do otherwise is to set up for failure. \n \n \nThey are the enemy and that's the way they want it. Mullahs are letting Ahmenijad project for them. You simply refuse to listen. But, I won't attack you for it.\n\n \n And why do you think that a group of people who has managed to run Iran relatively competently since Carter are going to act completely irrational with nuclear weapons? They have had experience with Soviet and Russian experts, technicians and scientists who have invariably explained the cost of accidents as well as the costs of a nuclear exchange. Furthermore, Iran population is heavily educated, unlike Pakistan, yet Pakistan was able, with a far less stable government, a far more powerful military and far less education populace to prevent nuclear war on several occasions with India. Why would a more stable, more educated, less politically-entrenched military fare worse? I don't like a nuclear Iran, but we just may have to live with it. It's a shame thorium reactors weren't built 20 years ago. This problem wouldn't have existed. \n \n I suggest you research two people: Sagan and Waltz. You don't understand because you project from your own bubble instead of projecting from their bubble, this is not a insult, it is observation, many people do this and hence why international relations and their effects are somewhat confusing. A enemy rarely acts exactly how you think it would, if that was true, the history of warfare would be radically different. It acts in correspondence to its views, not your's. The best strategists were the ones who could view the world from their adversary's point of view. \n \n \n6. I agree with this assessment. They need to learn the way to legitimacy. Israel is not the reason for their failures.\n\n \n The reason? Partially yes, but hardly even a quarter. Israel did screw them up, but they could have succeeded anyways. \n \n \n7 and 8. As I stated previously, I defer to your knowledge. What is the official U.S. stance on the event. What would Israel gain by attacking a U.S. vessel?\n\n \n US entry into the war. Not a bad plan if you ask me. Especially if it would allow the Israelis to reorganize their forces and strengthen their captured positions. Essentially placing US forces as a shield in front of theirs as they fortified is a smart move. Remember for most of the war Israeli forces were pretty constantly fighting. And Israel didn't have a lot of spare parts and troops to replace front line units. Its units were getting tired and stuff was breaking down. Even a statement of US entry into the war could have caused the Arab nations to cease. I hate to say, but if I was Israel and facing exhaustion among my army and breakdown of equipment on a entire army wide scale, I'd do something similar. You take your breaks where you get them, and if you have to create them, so be it. \n \n \n10. Where is the world outrage and the press coverage of this little fact? Why does this not matter?\n\n \n Perhaps because of Israel's exchange policy? (Which IMO is pretty screwed up as it creates incentive for kidnap if they can trade 1 soldier for 500 captured terrorists, this needs to stop). Or the war soured relations on the 2 captured soldiers. Plus this kind of stuff happens more then the news reports. Israeli troops are kidnapped on a regular basis over the past decade and they have been exchanged for jailed terrorists. A number of factors. It's kind of like the boy who cried wolf. It happens so regularly that it's not new to the world. Compare that to the kidnapped of the British sailors. How often are British sailors kidnapped? Oh NEVER? it's a frequency thing IMO. \n \n \n11. They might. I doubt it will be a long lived arrangement.\n\n \n It may actually be a good thing as both sides will never go to war as they know they will cease to exist if they exchange missiles. Why would you risk Tehran for Tel Aviv? We didn't risk DC, London or Paris for Moscow. India doesn't risk New Delhi for Karachi. The Soviets didn't risk Moscow, Vladivostok and other cities for the nuclear programs in China. \n \n On that note, the US could have conceivably took out virtually all of the Russian nuclear weapons, sea, silo and air. It was just those mobiles we couldn't track.",

They should prosecute anyone who knowingly pursued, engineered or participated in it. They should pay reparations to it's victims. \n I am saddened at this. \n 2. I have heard from others who hate Israel that Ahmenijhad is a talking head. But, he \"is\" the one talking. The mullahs are not stepping out to say that his rhetoric does not represent their views. The media gives credence to him. And that matters. \n 3. I do know that Islam wants the people they consider \"infidels\" dead. They see it as their life mission. They do not seek to convert people. They don't care about your belief system. They simply feel that if you are not Muslim, you should be dead. That is not speculation. It is stated in the Quran and Muslims believe it. That, really is all westerners need know about the Arab enemy, and how to hold them at bay until they force our hand to crush them. \n 4. You have more faith in Iran's attitudes toward peace than myself. You claim Ahminijhad is a talking head. No one in Iran is disagreeing publicly as of yet. All nations speakers are taken to task over the words they use. Bush has been hammered over his statement of \"Either you're with us, or against us\". \n Ahmenijhad's proclamations are much more inflamatory. \n 5. I will put some effort into this. Time is not a friend to me. But, I am developing a respect for your suggestions. But, if you mean that \"understanding\" the desires of the enemy means \"agreeing\" with their personal plights, it is not likely that I will view Iran as less of a threat or turn on Israel. \n 6. The act of creating Israel was as much a world effort versus Israel taking a military action that removed Palestinians from a homeland that has been claimed by both forever. Palestinians have not taken one positive step to improve life for themselves that did not consist of murder. \n 7. Covered in #1.\n 8. Kidnapping is wrong. No matter the details. If the media or others wish to prioritize the importance of each event, ignoring the \"person\" of each victim exposes the shallowness of their agendas. \n 9. Common sense. Not something I consider Iran blessed with. \n 10. Different players. \n 11. Your clarification of the actions of Israel have effected my feelings of trust for Israel. But, as you suggest, understanding their goals and seeing things as they do can help us to maintain a working relationship with them. \n I do know that Israel wakes up daily wondering, who will attack us today. \n I can not help but to sympathize with the dread each day brings to them. \n Every nation that borders them plots their demise. \n But, it would behoove them to apologize and reach out to the victims of their mis-adventure.",

One doesn't have to agree with anything their enemy wants. They just have to understand what they want, what they will pay and what is the likelihood of those occurring.

The kinds of attacks I'm referring to are happening in residential areas, often in apartment buildings. If you live in an apartment building, you are inherently surrounded by other people. It's not the same as bringing in a bunch of innocent people into your home in the hopes that you won't be attacked.\n Your anaolgy would suit what Saddam Hussein did more accurately in his atactic of surrounding palaces with innocent civilians.

Its war and fair play exits rather rapidly when one side is losing.\n\n \n As usual, excellent and true. I'm sure Mao in his wisdom knew and shared the fact that an enemy prepared to win will respond as necessary. Also that a weak enemy would fracture itself by criticism from the weak within itself.

Not taken by force. According to the left, where the only support for the U.N. exist in America, if the U.N. decided to give America to Iranians, we would have to honor that gift with loyalty. Which of course we would not and would kick the Iranians to the curb and have a reason to dismantle the U.N. and send it packing too. Oh happy day.",

I haven't always been anti Arab. I refute your accusation of prejudice. I became anti after becoming aware of the cowardly murderous tactics of Arabs. You'll have to do better than whimper to make me accept your accusation of American soldiers being the bad guys in Iraq. \n\n So \"cowardly\" murder is somehow worse than \"non-cowardly\" murder.\n Murder is murder.\n \n \n5.

I didn't fail to see it. I just didn't read it. I generally don't read all of the post of the folks I seem to be in agreement with and believe they are quite capable of responding adequately. Except for short exchanges. \n Indulge me, make me believe that hiding among civilians is honorable. \n 2. Death sucks. No matter who inflicts it. But nothing you say can convince me that Arab militants should be allowed to kill without paying a price. \n 3. I got reprimanded for that comment. My use of the word testicles was inappropriate. I apologize for the use of that word. But the content stands. \n No, I do not expect you to take anyone serious who defends the Jews and their right to exist un-harassed. I have and now state that I wish no harm on non combatant Arabs or Jews. While you justify the actions taken by Palestinians regardless the fact that innocents are the initial target.",

I doubt there is a solution. No westerners are migrating to Arab lands. So, we know there is no chance of western values bleeding into Arab society. On the other hand, the flow of Arab/Muslims into western society is constant and having an effect. Take Lansing Michigan for example. Michigan is a haven for Muslims and a good beginning for defeat from within. \n Study Sharia law, there's little room under it for secular progressives.",
