   "Warren Buffett's concept to significantly reduce USA's trade deficit\n \n I'm a proponent of a proposal that was introduced to the Senate in 2006. Trade deficits are always detrimental to a nation's GDP. Trade deficit's detriment to the GDP exceeds the amount of the deficit itself. The GDP bolsters the median wage.\n \n The basic concept is for exporters who choose to pay the federal fees to acquire transferable IMPORT Certificates for the assessed value of their goods leaving the USA. Importers would be required to surrender IMPORT Certificates for the assessed value of their goods entering the USA. Surrendered certificates are cancelled.\n \n This trade policy would decrease USA's trade deficit of goods and increase the aggregate sum of USA's imports plus exports. It can be drafted to be completely self funding. It would not require any additional federal spending, taxes or debt. It would be a permanent stimulant that would increase our GDP more than otherwise.\n \n Refer to: www.USA-Trade-Deficit.Blogspot.com \n \n Respectfully, Supposn",

   "Simone, the trade concept I advocate would eliminate a significant proportion of USA's global trade deficit with regard to the values of goods; but it would not be applicable to the value of explicitly listed scarce or rare minerals integral within any goods. \n \n This proposal would certainly increase USA's GDP. In my opinion this proposal would almost certainly increase USA's manufacturing production but since it is a proposal for a market rather than a government driven trade policy, the USA greatest increase of production could be within other than the manufacturing industries.\n \n Your response is not explicit. You do not state where you stand with regard to this specific trade proposal.\n \n Respectfully, Supposn",
