   "Our success is killing us\n \n The aims of technology are achieved and our chances for survival are fatally diminished. The fault is not in our technology but in us. The fault lies within human society.\n \n McLuhan made us aware of the fact that technology is an extension of our self. I would say that we and also our ecosystem are both gestalts, a whole, wherein there are complex feedback loops that permit self healing and various means that protect us from our self. \n \n The dictionary defines gestalt as meaning a structure, configuration, or pattern of physical, biological, or psychological phenomena so integrated as to constitute a functional unit with properties not derivable by summation of its parts. When we interfere with the gestalt, i.e. our ecosystem or our self, we are changing some one or some few of the feedback loops that help us maintain equilibrium. Such modifications, if not fully understood, can send the gestalt into a mode wherein equilibrium can no longer be maintained.\n \n In 1919 Ernest Rutherford announced to a shocked world \"I have been engaged in experiments which suggest that the atom can be artificially disintegrated. If it is true, it is far greater importance than a war.\" Today's stem-cell research could, in my opinion, be considered as more important than a war and also more important than Rutherford's research success.\n \n The discussion regarding the advisability of continuing stem-cell research primarily focuses on the religious/political factor and on the technology but there is little or no focus upon the impact that could result to our society beyond its health effects.\n \n We are unwilling or unable to focus on the long-term effects of our technology and thus should put much of it on hold until we gain a better means to evaluate the future implications of our technology. \n \n What do you think about this serious matter?",

   "I would have to agree, technology is killing us. There is no reason why I should be typing a response to this and not having the conversation face to face. With the green revelution after WWII, the global populaton exploded. It made life better and longer for many people, but I believe that it has accelerated the decline of the individual. I believe that persons are scarce, and people are everywhere. I recently had the thought that the only reason paradises (tropical islands, etc.) are paradises is that they suck. The locals are for the most part extremely poor, but they live in paradise. There is nothing wrong with money as a fluid way to keep track of things, but when it becomes the sole motivation, life is gone. I find it fascenating that nobody plays super mario any more. It is just as good now as it was when it first came out, the only difference is that video games have come out that are better. My question is when the race will be over, and we can just play the game. I am baffeled at how people in our society seem to always prepare for a better tomorrow for themselves, but never enjoy the day. I heard a quote once \"life is what happens when you are busy making plans\". Is that only our culture, or is it a fundamental part of human nature. I for one like to take the time to smell the roses. I have spent hours in my bedroom watching the shadow cross the floor, and making a concerted effort not to think about anything. I work just enough to get by. There is a problem when you live to work, rather than the other way around. I think that everyone would agree with me, but few would take a nap under a tree, for fear that they will loose the rat race.",

   "Some interesting points raised\n \n \nThe aims of technology are achieved and our chances for survival are fatally diminished.\n\n \n This seems a rather melodramatic prelude to what follows, I don't see how the \"aims of technology are achieved\", technology doesn't have it's own aims, and I have plans for it that are yet unrealised. Give me a cure for cancer and a 500 year lifespan please.\n \n \nthere is little or no focus upon the impact that could result to our society beyond its health effects.\n\n \n Don't care, society can suck it. The abolition of the class system and the advent of the production line revolutionised society as it was known, for the better.\n \n \nWe are unwilling or unable to focus on the long-term effects of our technology and thus should put much of it on hold until we gain a better means to evaluate the future implications of our technology. \n\n \n As a gestalt system, we are not going to be able to anticipate the consequences of changes in society, waiting for the \"means to evaluate the future implications of our technology\" means waiting for a day that will never come. What if we prohibited electricity until we worked out what the consequences would be? We would still be debating what it would result in, and no one would agree that it would eventuate in the production of the internet. It's a futile, pointless excercise.\n \n \nThere is no reason why I should be typing a response to this and not having the conversation face to face. \n\n \n There's a very good reason, and it's the fact you're talking to people who live all over the world, the expense of having it face to face would be enormous.\n \n \nI recently had the thought that the only reason paradises (tropical islands, etc.) are paradises is that they suck. The locals are for the most part extremely poor, but they live in paradise.\n\n \n Not really, tropical queensland is paradise and some people there are quite wealthy.\n \n \nMy question is when the race will be over, and we can just play the game. I am baffeled at how people in our society seem to always prepare for a better tomorrow for themselves, but never enjoy the day.\n\n \n Because satisfaction comes from the pursuit of your interests a lot of the time. When you play Super Mario, do you try to progress through it, or does the enjoyment come from wandering aimlessly? Perhaps sometimes both, but usually from taking on challenges and succeeding. Incidentally the online distribution of SNES titles to the Wii has been highly successful - people do actually still buy Super Mario.",

   "Symbiote, I have to agree with you when you say that the internet allows people to communicate from all over the world. I was thinking more about people you know, and how the use of cell phones and facebook is silly. I did not draw a distinction between people you are in close proximity to (your friends) and other people different from yourself (anyone who can listen or wants to say something ). I will have to consider this and get back to you at a later time.",
