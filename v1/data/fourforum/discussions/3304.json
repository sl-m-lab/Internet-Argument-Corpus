My support for any defense posture which includes pre-emptive action against emerging threats does not eminate from some simple desire to play the bully. I would prefer very strongly that US troops not be needed or desired anywhere but at home raising and loving their families and I feel no envy for soldiers in harms way fighting an often unseen, undetected ruthless enemy in the hills of Afgahnistan or the streets of Bagdad. You are certainly correct to point out that foreign policy mistakes will lead to future disasters. I think it's safe to say that 9-11 and the resulting wars are a case study in how our past failures can lead to such disasters.

   "Well, I saved the WOW when we lit up the skies of Baghdad, now THAT was sweet LOL It's a different war and they started it...they understand strength, and thanks to the Liberals undermining our strength it makes the job tougher for our guys over there. They laugh at all the wimpy, righteous folks screaming about Abu Ghraib and underwear on some animals head, and how we have to fight a war with PC considerations. They know all they have to do is put a few tear jerker pictures out there and the Liberals will jump in to limit some other aspect of the war\n\n this is exactly my point. war supporters just revel in the idea of us blowing up anybody or anything, whether they were guilty or not. blowing up baghdad did nothing in this war against terrorism except inspire neutral iraqis to hate america more. nice job",

   "I actually agree with you to some degree. There's no question that there are some other countries that have a higher concentration of terrorists. I will not make any silly assumptions that I know the entire plan for the war on terrorism. You seem to be expecting a clear cut plan like WWII and that's not going to happen. This is something that could take generations perhaps, one step at a time. Maybe we are doing what the terrorists are doing. If they can take down the big guy (us), then all the other countries will be easy pickings then. If THEY started with some dinky little country, we have the ability to go in and assist them, but if WE are gone, those countries are on their own and don't have a chance. How do you know for sure that maybe we are doiing the same thing..getting rid of a country that was mmost likely involved in the training and arming of terrorists at the very least. When theyt fall, then maybe it will be easier to work on those other dinky countries that support terrorism. Also, I would like to ask, do you support Israel's policies on dealing with terrorists? And would you support them launching an attack on Syria and the like, so that we can have two fronts on the war?\n\n i would support putting this iraqi freedom project on hold and dealing with the more pressing issues, like dismantling existing terrorist organizations. whoever believes that islamic american-hating fundamentalist terrrorists will be inspired to change their hearts when they see a \"beacon of democracy\" in iraq is a fool. terrorists are criminals, and you handle criminals by locking them up or killing them (where execution is warranted). you dont give criminals free ice cream and hope that they will stop their crime. thats what bush is doing\n \n and what makes you think these countries are \"dinky\" or any less in status than iraq? look at egypt, yemen, UAE, libya or syria. these countries are highly developed and more internationally stable than even iraq. and they all have strong al qaeda involvement. and dont even start on saudi arabia, our ME buddies, and home to 14 of the 19 9/11 hijackers. we should be confronting terrorism where the terrorists are, not in any old country we happened to have on going beef with\n \n and look at afghanistan. you wanna talk about dinky?",

   "It's quite simple, Liberals seem to oppose the war, they are perceived, rightfully so, as having the \"values\" that the terrorists hate, so therefore, Liberals should be all for the war...aaaahhhh but they're not because Bush has the mark of the beast after his name.\n \n I suggest that you take some of your own advice then\n \n See, that's the problem, you looked in the wrong place...you might want to try spineless or wimpy LOL  It's clear that Liberals find nothing worth fighting or dying for...oh wait, unless the President has a \"D\" after his name\n\n \n I don't think I even need to reply to that, just having it appear again as a quote does more than enough in response.\n \n Oh wait, Kerry shot and killed people, and got shot at, defending this country. GW ran to the guard and got an early-out. Is Bush a liberal then by this logic?\n \n -Mach",
