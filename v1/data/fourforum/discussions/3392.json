Change in the genes results in a change in the amino acid sequence, due to the phsyical natures of amino acids this could alter the way the protein folds, which in turn may alter the final product.\n \n \n\n This just backs up the argument. You claim that there could be other places where life exists, but there isn't life there, therefore they are not suited for life, the earth is... it is so suited for life.\n \n There is much more to this theory than that; including the position of the earth in relation to the sun, it's tilt, the fact we've got a moon, and the position and size of other planets.\n For the first factors, they all go to creating seasons, tides, change, life. The second, the other planets, they help protect the earth by, in a sense, acting like giant sweepers, drawing many would-be dangerous objects into their path, and not ours.\n Advanced life, there is evidence that they may be life in most of the places that could support it (several asteroids even have the same IR spectrum as bacterial colonies, even some patchs of compounds that shouldn't survive in clouds on Venus that could be due to life, even more places we just haven't looked yet).\n Life can and probably has formed in a much greater variety of places than Earth, Earth is well suited to advanced life and seeing as the chance it would arise may actually be quite high - that it has done so and advanced is not suprising. These locations may be rare, but it would be more suprising to not find life on them than it is to find it. On a unviersal scale the chance of finding advanced life might be rare on any one planet, but on a planet that could support that type of life the chance is very high.\n Most of the rare factors only apply to the majority of earthlike life, and some of those are even to be expected (i.e large gas giants outside its orbit, rocky planets of the right elements within a certain band etc), not every time but if you have one, then you probably have more.",

   "Again you are missing the point, think of it from the perspective of designing a car - the instructions for building it do not require you to devise some means for combustion to occur, its a process that will happen naturally if the car is built like the instructions say. Same with the genes, the genes don't even code for half of the structures that make up our bodies but the machines that make them, in addition it has nothing in it that govern the rules for making these machines - just the parts that will work correctly when put together. Change in the genes results in a change in the amino acid sequence, due to the physical natures of amino acids this could alter the way the protein folds, which in turn may alter the final product.\n\n Your analogy proves my point again. The design of how the things fit together is important. The actual function of them comes about later on. For the gene-centric argument you're arguing that the combustion system makes the car, not the other way around. The shape of the folds, so important to life (as the frame of the car is, to the placing of the engine), is not dependent upon the genes. So, you need to account for it. And the gene-centric arguments can't. And as with the design of the car, the actual positioning of all the components is important. ID theorists would welcome your contribution :)\n \nAdvanced life, there is evidence that they may be life in most of the places that could support it (several asteroids even have the same IR spectrum as bacterial colonies, even some patches of compounds that shouldn't survive in clouds on Venus that could be due to life, even more places we just haven't looked yet).\n\n Please provide evidence to show that life has been found in outer-space.\n Secondly, is bacteria 'advanced life'?\n \nLife can and probably has formed in a much greater variety of places than Earth, Earth is well suited to advanced life and seeing as the chance it would arise may actually be quite high - that it has done so and advanced is not surprising.\n\n There is a difference between saying 'it is possible that life could exist', and 'life exists'. We know life exists on earth, not elsewhere. Therefore earth is suited for life.\n \nThese locations may be rare, but it would be more surprising to not find life on them than it is to find it. On a universal scale the chance of finding advanced life might be rare on any one planet, but on a planet that could support that type of life the chance is very high.\n\n If you are arguing for life in the galaxy based on statistics, show me your theory.\n \nMost of the rare factors only apply to the majority of earthlike life, and some of those are even to be expected (i.e large gas giants outside its orbit, rocky planets of the right elements within a certain band etc), not every time but if you have one, then you probably have more.\n\n So? There's life here, not elsewhere.",

Seems not.\n Sorry, assumed he was a real biologist. No one is arguring that life didn't happen, so obviously the universe must have formed in such a way that life could arise - we can see it has. This is very different from saying that the Universe formed for life, real scientists treat this like an experiment (because fundamentally it is) and test hypothesis to see whether they would result in what we see today.

'x' amount of planets, 'y' percent of them just must have life. Why? Well, they just must have\n 'Why' is covered under the chances of 'x' and 'y' happening - if earth like planets occur in 'x' amount of planets due to the way solar systems condense and from what materials and this occurs 'y' numbers of times due to the way that the early systems condense out. The it stands to reason that you would expect planets that are like Earth to be like Earth - course at the moment quite how 'like Earth' a planet must be we don't really know as we only have the one example of one. \n \n \n\n Well there you go! More stats. What are the chances of there being life on other planets?\n No idea, no one knows due the vast range of different variables covering a broad range of fields along with some other things we may not have taken into account, or things we have assumed you need but are wrong.
