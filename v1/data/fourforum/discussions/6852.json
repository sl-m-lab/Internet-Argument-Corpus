   "Locri, a city founded by Greek colonists in southern Italy in the seventh century BC, was renowned for the severity of its penal code. However, any citizen who proposed some new regulation was obliged to give his reasons for it while standing on the public gallows with a noose around his neck. If an assembly of the people, after hearing his reasons, did not approve the new law there and then, the man was hanged, immediately. \n \n Perhaps the Locrians were a little extreme, but before we are suffocated by the blanket of law which is thickened by new legislation with each day that passes, isn't it time to say that lots of new laws may have seemed desirable once, but we have quite enough of them now ?",

   "Hehe.. I really like your \"introduction\". Forceful and witty.\n \n As for the question at hand, I agree to a certain point. Measures should be taken to make legislation as clear cut, simple and to the point. But I`m not so sure that one should make it harder to propose new legislastion though...",
