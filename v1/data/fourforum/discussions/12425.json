   " Democrats show little appetite for gun control \n There will also be a push to repeal the so-called Tiahrt amendment, named after Rep. Todd Tiahrt, R-Kan., that limits the authority of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to disclose gun-trace data to the public and requires that certain records submitted to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System be destroyed after 24 hours.\n \n Both the Third Way's Bennett and Helmke said it may take another major gun crime, like the shootings at Columbine High School or Virginia Tech, to get Congress to act on more ambitious gun control initiatives.\n \n Those include overturning a law enacted in 2005 that denies gun crime victims the right to sue firearms manufacturers and dealers for damages.\n \n Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said she plans to push legislation to reinstate a federal ban on some assault weapons that became law during the Clinton administration in 1994 but expired under the Bush administration in 2004. Another long-term goal is requiring that all gun shows conduct background checks before selling firearms.\n \n The NRA's Cox said his group is gearing up to fight a new assault weapons ban, noting that Obama supports one and that Attorney General Eric Holder recently linked the proliferation of military-style weapons to the violence along the Mexican border. \"It's laughable if it wasn't so serious to suggest that diminishing the Second Amendment will positively impact the situation down in Mexico,\" Cox said.\n\n And to put some meat on the bones of what Daewoo said about the NRA.\n \nBut he said the NRA is also prepared to work with Democrats, as it did in 2007 in the wake of the Virginia Tech shootings,....\n\n \n We can add to this list, Singin's desire of criminalizing gun owners who don't report gun thefts in a required time and to lock up all guns in a manner that will prevent thefts. He of course says that does not mean jail, but aiding and abetting and straw sales already require serious jail time. and straw sales is already a Federal Offense with either 5 or 10 year jail terms. So we are talking about Very Serious jail terms regardless of what Sinjin might say in order to sell the idea. And one more thing the Anti-gun forces want but won't say it now.\n \n Any sensible pro-guntrol advocate would support concentrating efforts on handguns. All else is secondary. You suggested otherwise.\n",

   "\"...a report on research that collected and analyzed data on how firearms were illegally obtained by criminals; also discussed was whether supply-side intervention could be effective in reducing criminals' access to guns. \n \n Abstract: Sources of information for the study were interviews with offenders regarding where they obtained their guns; analysis of trace data recorded by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF); and the analysis of ATF data from illegal-firearms investigations. Interviews with criminals regarding the sources of their firearms showed that one-third were obtained from theft, and most of the remainder of the weapons were obtained from family or friends and \"straw\" purchases (having a friend or family member make a legal purchase of a firearm and then transfer the weapon to the offender). Analysis of ATF trace data on firearms found that firearms were rapidly diverted from legitimate retail purchases to use in criminal activity within 1 year of the purchase, suggesting a quick change of hands after the retail purchase. An analysis of ATF investigations showed that sources of illegal firearms were \"straw\" purchases, unlicensed sellers, guns shows, and thefts. Investigations also found that there are organized groups involved in firearms thefts from various sources. Seventy-eight percent of the investigations involved the use of new guns in crimes. The research suggests that supply-side interventions can be effective by focusing on point sources; however, research must be done to determine whether specific intervention strategies are effective in reducing criminals' access to guns.\"\n NCJRS Abstract - National Criminal Justice Reference Service",

   "FYI,\n \n Here is how my state already deals with \"strawman\" purchases from dealers as well as private transactions which arm felons. Class 6 felonies are punished by a max of 5 years, and class 5 felonies are punished by a max of 10 years. There is no mandatory sentence unless otherwise noted. If you are interested, you can look up these statutes and other gun control statutes in Virginia here: LIS < Code of Virginia \n \n \n 1. \"Strawman\" purchases from gun dealers\n \n 18.2-308.2:2. Criminal history record information check required for the transfer of certain firearms. This statute has a lot of other stuff in it, but the summary for \"strawman\" purchases is as follows:\n Criminal record history check required for any dealer to sell, give, or trade any firearm. Class 6 felony for gun dealer who does not perform a record check. Class 5 felony for any person to \"knowingly make a materially false statement on a firearm\" purchase form. (example, answering \"No\" to the have you ever been convicted of a felony when you have been in the past)\n \n Class 6 felony for any person to attempt to make a \"strawman\" purchase for someone else. \n \n Penalty increases to a Class 5 felony to make a \"strawman\" purchase for someone you know or have reason to know cannot legally possess a firearm (example: Buying a gun for a known felon) and the penalty increases to include a mandatory 5 years which cannot be suspended if more than one gun is involved. \n \n Class 5 felony with mandatory 5 years which cannot be suspended for a person who cannot legally possess a gun to solicit another to purchase a gun for him (example, a felon gives you money and asks you to buy a gun for him). \n \n 2. Otherwise arming felons\n \n For non-dealer involved private \"street\" sales of firearms, you are not required to conduct a background check before selling, giving, or trading the gun. If, however, you sell, give, or trade a gun to a person you \"know or should have reason to know\" is a felon, the you can be convicted as an accessory to his possession of a firearm by a felon offense, and you can receive the exact same punishment he would receive for having the gun, which is contained in this statute:\n \n \u00a7 18.2-308.2. Possession or transportation of firearms, stun weapons, explosives or concealed weapons by convicted felons (summary):\n \n If the felon's conviction was for a non-violent felony (larceny, forging checks, unauthorized use of an automobile are examples) committed more than ten years ago, then a class 6 felony.\n \n It the felon's conviction was for a non-violent felony committed less than ten years ago, then a class 6 felony with a mandatory minimum sentence which cannot be suspended of 2 years.\n \n If the felon's conviction was for a violent felony (murder, rape, robbery, burglary are examples), then no matter how old the conviction the punishment if a mandatory 5 years which cannot be suspended.\n \n You do not have to know what felony the felon was convicted of. All you have to know is that he is a felon, and you punishment is then set by the nature of his felony conviction (even if, for example, a convicted murder lied and told you he was only convicted of a non violent felony-you would still get the violent felony punishment)\n \n I am all in favor of mandatory sentencing laws, particularly when they involve firearm crimes. For example, selling cocaine is punished by not less than 5 years nor more than 40 years imprisonment. In my experience, however, the sentence judges impose averages 12-18 months of active jail time, which does little to deter the crime. But, if the drug dealer is armed with a firearm while selling then he can get a mandatory 5 years which cannot be suspended for the separate offense being an armed drug dealer. \n \n Another mandatory sentencing law I favor is for the crime of using or displaying a firearm in the commission of violent felonies, which brings an additional three year sentence which cannot be suspended or run concurrently with other sentences if you use or display a gun, for example, during a robbery.\n \n I have no problem reconciling my strong pro-gun individual right ideology with a desire to harshly punish crimes committed with firearms.",

That is one of the secrets re: the big fuss over retaining brady check info. The BATFE can only hold that info for so long and then it has to be destroyed, but they can keep the info re: who is buying firearms from dealers for as long as they want. \n \n When you get into firearms that are not reported stolen or private sales it is a different matter. Private sale guns are virtually untracable, and a weapon that is stolen and not reported is more or less untracable. \n \n I am not sure how much a national database would help that, though. I would imagine that in most cases where guns are stolen and not reported, the owner does not realize they have been stolen. I think that a lot of the trouble I have seeing eye to eye with you on that one is a difference in geography and background. I think that if you had a gun and it went missing, you would notice. I \"found\" a .44 rifle the other day behind the feed bins in my tack room that not only did I not realize I had \"lost\", I forgot I ever had it. I apparently took it with me riding one day, set it on the back of the grain bin when I was done, got distracted and did not notice it got knocked back behind there. \n \n In some places, guns are rare and a big deal. Here they are not. Despite our zero tolerance policy, it is not unusual to drive by the high school during deer season and see a bunch of high powered rifles hanging in the rear window of pickup trucks. Lock guns up?? Then what do you need when you do one? I keep a .22 rifle by the back door that I use when coyotes, foxes, or bobcats go after our chickens or the kids rabbits (which happens frequently). I have 3 kids under 6, and there is a rifle sitting there by the back door. First, my kids know you do NOT touch daddys guns unless he is RIGHT THERE helping you. Second, the ammo for it is on top of the door jam. It will be another 6 years before any of them can reach it, and by then at least 2 of them will probably have their own.\n \n That is my big problem with most of the ideas you put forth. They turn something that currently is no big deal into a major pain in the rear. I understand that there are some areas of the country where they make sense and are probably needed. I also recognize that they will not work there unless we do them EVERYWHERE and complicate EVERYBODIES lives. If I was AT ALL convinced that it woudl work I would be willing to make the sacrifice, but it just does not seem likely to me that it will. When you point out that places with the strictest gun control have the highest crime rates, people say \"but that is because the guns come from other areas where gun control is NOT as strict\". I can buy that. The problem is that works on a national level, too. Mexico has strict gun laws and they bring guns in illegally over the US border, by boat, and by plane. They have some of the strictest gun control in North America, and they are on the brink of a civil war, and the bad guys are better armed than the good guys. \n \n \n \n \nYou'll forgive me if I haven't thought all of this through thoroughly. I'm just a 2A supporter interested in discussing possible measures to combat criminal access to firearms. To do that one must be prepared to put up with being called \"gun grabber\" and stupid and unpatriotic and other insults. I find myself having to fight on multiple fronts simultaneously all the while correcting misquotes, strawmen, statistical manipulations, etc., etc.\n\n \n Believe me, I understand. I have been reading your posts/debating with you since 2004 (granted I have been absent more often than not the last several months) and while I have not always agreed with your ideas or arguments, they have always been honest and thought provoking. \n \n Dont let the new penny gallery crowd get you down. They will either calm down and start THINKING or they will eventually go somewhere else. If I outlasted missouri mule and voice of reason, surely you can take a little flack from the intellectual cheap seats :)",

   "How does one access the paper trail in Georgia from Maine?\n\n \n One does not access the paper trail; the police do. They have all the resources necessary to find out who bought a gun and from where, so leave it to them. You aren't proposing that the public do the work of the police for them, are you?\n \n \nWhat if the person who purchased the gun never reported it lost/stolen?\n\n \n Unless you can show that they did it intentionally and purposely, then you have nothing.\n \n \nWhat if the sale was not through a dealer?\n\n \n I'm not seeing the problem here. There's no evidence that most of the guns that're sold in private transactions wind up in criminal hands, so I don't see it as a problem that needs addressing. So unless you've got some evidence that you're withholding, there's not much you can really argue.\n \n \nYou'll forgive me if I haven't thought all of this through thoroughly. I'm just a 2A supporter interested in discussing possible measures to combat criminal access to firearms.\n\n \n First, I highly doubt that you're a Second Amendment supporter. I've never seen you post support for anything but gun control.\n \n Second, what you propose isn't possible in a society that values civil and human rights. Britain has tried its best to make guns inaccessible to criminals, and not only is there an illicit trade where you can buy a fully automatic machine gun for 800 pounds british, but now they're claiming that the knife culture is out of control and the number of fatal stabbings have been on the increase for years.\n \n A preemptive measure isn't possible as far as I can see, nor is out justice system based on preemptive measures; we don't arrest people and charge them for crimes that they have not yet committed. We're an after the fact society, meaning that we punish the lawbreakers. If you don't like that then protest for change, so people can be arrested and tried without evidences or mens rea.\n \n \nTo do that one must be prepared to put up with being called \"gun grabber\" and stupid and unpatriotic and other insults. I find myself having to fight on multiple fronts simultaneously all the while correcting misquotes, strawmen, statistical manipulations, etc., etc.\n\n \n You just don't seem to understand that taking away rights does nothing to stop, impede, or inhibit the criminal element. Why is that? Britain tried this and their illegal gun culture is beyond any control.",

At the Constitutional Convention, the proposal to include a bill of rights was considered and defeated. The Bill of Rights was added to the Constitution as the first ten amendments on December 15, 1791.\n \n The fact that the Constitution did not include a bill of rights to specifically protect Americans' hard-won rights sparked the most heated debates during the ratification process. To the Federalists, those who favored the Constitution, a bill of rights was unnecessary because the Federal Government was limited in its powers and could not interfere with the rights of the people or the states; also, most states had bills of rights. To the Anti-Federalists, those who opposed the Constitution, the prospect of establishing a strong central government without an explicit list of rights guaranteed to the people was unthinkable. \n\n \n   FEDERALIST No. 28 HAMILTON \n If the representatives of the people betray their constituents, there is then no resource left but in the exertion of that \n  original right of self-defense \n which is paramount to all positive forms of government, and which against the usurpations of the national rulers, may be exerted with infinitely better prospect of success than against those of the rulers of an individual state. \n In a single state, if the persons intrusted with supreme power become usurpers, the different parcels, subdivisions, or districts of which it consists, having no distinct government in each, can take no regular measures for defense. \n  The citizens must rush tumultuously to arms, without concert, without system, without resource; except in their courage and despair. \n The usurpers, clothed with the forms of legal authority, can too often crush the opposition in embryo.\n \n The obstacles to usurpation and the facilities of resistance increase with the increased extent of the state, provided the citizens understand their rights and are disposed to defend them. \n",

   "So you're calling for much bigger, much more invasive government, implementing a system that's far too cumbersome to be of any practical use, and the only thing it'll actually do is cost billions in taxpayer money?\n \n What will your answer be if there's no funding for the system you propose? What cuts are you willing to make just so you can tell where gun owner Joe Average lives?\n\n Even the violence policy center recognizes this.\n   What are the limitations of licensing and registration? \n Licensing systems are very expensive to administer. Canada's experience with its full licensing and registration system, begun in December 1998, is not encouraging. The government originally estimated that the cost of licensing Canada's three million gun owners and registering their seven million guns would be $185 million [Canadian] over five years including a one-time start-up cost of $85 million [Canadian]. But, by March 2000 the Canadian Firearms Centre admitted that the system had already cost Canadian taxpayers $327 million [Canadian] and was running up an annual bill nearly 10 times higher than the government's original forecast. The March announcement also revealed that although 270,000 valid licenses existed from the country's earlier gun control system, only 142,000 new licenses had been issued. Using these figures as a baseline for America's arsenal of 65 million handguns, the estimated cost of such a system here is staggering.\n \n Most importantly, licensing and registration in America would have little effect on the vast majority of gun violence, such as unintentional gunshot deaths, suicides and the majority of homicides, since most homicides are the result of arguments between people who know each other and who purchase guns legally.\n \n From a political perspective, a battle over licensing and registration brings every gun owner into the fray. The NRA argument that licensing and registration is the first step towards gun confiscation has always been very persuasive with gun owners. In contrast, health and safety regulation of the industry focuses on the conduct of firearm manufacturers. \n Advocates of licensing and registration often cite automobiles as an example of the value of licensing and registration: we register automobiles and license drivers, so why not guns? However, licensing and registration-the primary purpose of which was to enforce a system of taxation-had virtually no effect on automobile death and injury. It was not until the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration was established in the 1960s, and changes were forced in automobile design and the driving environment, that decreases were seen. \n \n \n Canada's registration program cost overruns is over 2 Bullion dollars to register 7 million guns!",

Federalist Papers no. 84 \n \n I go further, and affirm that bills of rights, in the sense and in the extent in which they are contended for, are not only unnecessary in the proposed constitution, but would even be dangerous. They would contain various exceptions to powers which are not granted; and on this very account, would afford a colourable pretext to claim more than were granted. For why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do? Why for instance, should it be said, that the liberty of the press shall not be restrained, when no power is given by which restrictions may be imposed? I will not contend that such a provision would confer a regulating power; but it is evident that it would furnish, to men disposed to usurp, a plausible pretence for claiming that power.\"\n\n \n I submit that this is exactly what you guys are proposing to do. Usurping power that does not belong to you. \n \n The Hamilton on the Courts.\n   FEDERALIST No. 78 \n Nor does this conclusion by any means suppose a superiority of the judicial to the legislative power. It only supposes that the power of the people is superior to both; and that where the will of the legislature, declared in its statutes, stands in opposition to that of the people, declared in the Constitution, the judges ought to be governed by the latter rather than the former. They ought to regulate their decisions by the fundamental laws, rather than by those which are not fundamental.\n\n \n We are a Republic. Not a democracy, and there is a very distinct difference. We are a Nation that is governed by the Rule of Law. The U.S. Constitution. The U.S. Constitution along with its Bill of Rights. And Everyone Must Obey the Law. That includes the Government. This is the only way this system works. In fact, The U.S. Constitution and just one person is a super majority under the rule of law. It does not matter what one thinks of anothers Constitutionally protected Rights, it is thoroughly protected.\n \n The simple truth is, Congress has not been delegated the power to make gun control laws. In fact, the 2nd Amendment says Shall not Be Infringe. \n \n  U.S. Supreme Court PRESSER v. STATE OF ILLINOIS, 116 U.S. 252 (1886) \n It was so held by this court in the case of U. S. v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. 542 , 553, in which the chief justice, in delivering the judgment of the court, said that the right of the people to keep and bear arms 'is not a right granted by the constitution. Neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence. The second amendment declares that it shall not be infringed, but this, as has been seen, means no more than that it shall not be infringed by congress. This is one of the amendments that has no other effect than to restrict the powers of the national government,&#8230;\n\n The preamble to Our Bill of Rights states its purpose. \n   Preamble to the Bill of Rights ] \n THE Conventions of a number of the States having at the time of their adopting the Constitution, expressed a desire, \n in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers, that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added: And as extending the ground of public confidence in the Government, will best insure the beneficent ends of its institution. [/color] \n\n Again the Constitution''s Bill of Rights restricts the Government. The Government is limited in scope and powers.\n \n \nThe constitution was written to limit the power of gov't and to ensure all rights to the people. Government does not possess 'rights' but 'enumerated powers' and only those enumerated. The theory that gov't possess 'rights' and then can curtail or ration those rights to the people as they deem necessary for their own security is ludicrous to say the least! Indeed, it is the citizen's duty to aid the police and not the other way around. Each citizen is charged with the \"preservation\" of the Constitution and individual police power to promote and defend the Constitution, himself, and the legitimate powers of the State.\n\n So I see that what I wrote is Very Relevant to this conversation!\n \n I am sure that everyone here believes in the Rule of Law. And I am going to further assume that we all wish for everyone to obey the law? That should also include the Government. No? What is being proposed goes Far beyond the scope of delegated powers granted to the Government, and it constitutes a very dangerous infringement on the Constitution and its Bill of Rights.\n \n So my answer to Sinjin is you do not have the authority, unless you intend to usurp it!",

The answer is obvious, The Government.\n\n \n Yes, they do and always have had claim over your personal property when it comes to militia service. Every one of our founding fathers, with the exception of Adams, was an officer in the milita.

It is not even possible to argue that a measure like registration of guns, which adds no impediment to sale, ownership, or transfer, is \"control\". The government in this country since DAY ONE has had the power to compel you to appear to provide service to the militia carrying your OWN PROPERTY. \n \n Lets look at the militia powers in article 1, sec 8:\n \n \nTo provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress;\n\n \n Since day one in this country militiamen were required to provide their own personal weapons. How in the hell could you possibly organize the militia without knowing for sure what weapons were available? How could you arm your militia in a cost effective manner if you did not know what arms you could expect from the private sector? Do you just buy a bunch of guns randomly and hope the number is right? \n \n \nHere is the Militia Act of 1792. Please show me where the quartermaster kept a log of serial numbered weapons. They did not. However, the Government can tell me stuff like I need to be provided with this. What I need to be supplied with.\n   Militia Act of 1792, \n\n \n The quartermasters only job was the maintenance, inventory, and dispersal of GOVERNMENT OWNED equipment. The requirement that militia commanders keep a full inventory of arms and munitions for their district was first instituted by George Washington. He did it by executive order as the CiC of the military and head of the militia. It remained a requirement until 1817, when our population had grown to the point that the task was deemed too difficult (no excel back then). \n \n \nAlexander Hamilton put it this way when he was arguing on the Bill of Rights.   Federalist Papers no. 84 \n \n I submit that this is exactly what you guys are proposing to do. Usurping power that does not belong to you. \n\n \n Except nobody is suggesting usurping any powers. \n \n \n \nWe are a Republic. Not a democracy, and there is a very distinct difference.

Not at all. Most of what you wrote above was nonsensical as well. It must be breathtakingly difficult to quote Hamilton in a discussion on rights and look dumb doing it. Your approach on that is interesting and noteworthy...just throw out random, nonsensical quotes that do not touch on the subject matter and I guess anybody can make themselves look like a fool, no matter who they are quoting. \n \n \nI am sure that everyone here believes in the Rule of Law.

You are inventing laws and constitutional restrictions based on what appears to be a 4th grade understanding of constitutional principals. You are also working from the ridiculous position that pretty much any law that involves guns is gun control. \n \n The president could, in theory, come out of the white house tomorrow morning and order that every person in American present an itemized list of all the arms and ammunition they own so that they could build a database to use in case of foreign invasion and he would be perfectly within his rights as the head of the militia to do it. It would be UNQUESTIONABLY constitutional. In fact, he could require that we all SHOW UP somewhere (muster) with our guns and ammunitions to be inspected and he would still be within his rights.\n \n Congress could do the same thing, but they would have to actually vote on it. \n \n Did you not realize that there are RESPONSIBILITIES that come with being an American Citizen, and one of those is militia duty if called upon? Maybe you should have checked into that.",

   "Part of the problem daewoo, is we are both saying the same thing, but you are not recognizing it. And another part you are just being plain cruel.\n \n \nYes, they do and always have had claim over your personal property when it comes to militia service. Every one of our founding fathers, with the exception of Adams, was an officer in the milita. Every single one of them, including Madison, who wrote the second amendment, kept a written inventory of privately held arms and munition in their district. Every one of them demanded that their men show up to muster with their OWN PRIVATELY OWNED weapons. \n\n I have no doubt of that these men served. But claim over Militia property? So you are saying they can confiscate it? \n \n However, the President can just as easily say, have an Assault style rifle by this date. What reason does he need the serial number? And what difference would how many, and what one has be? He has the right to say, Have one by this date, and have this much ammo! Like this.\n   Militia Act of 1792, \nThat every citizen, so enrolled and notified, shall, within six months thereafter, provide himself with a good musket or firelock, a sufficient bayonet and belt, two spare flints, and a knapsack, a pouch, with a box therein, to contain not less than twenty four cartridges, suited to the bore of his musket or firelock, each cartridge to contain a proper quantity of powder and ball; or with a good rifle, knapsack, shot-pouch, and powder-horn, twenty balls suited to the bore of his rifle, and a quarter of a pound of powder; and shall appear so armed,\n \n I would be very interested in where you think the serial numbers were recorded. Especially since most guns were not serialized. \n \n However, shortly after this act the Springfield National Armory was established. \n \n \nThe government in this country since DAY ONE has had the power to compel you to appear to provide service to the militia carrying your OWN PROPERTY.\n\n I never said any different. What I said is part of Congress responsibility was to PROVIDE for arming the Militia. \n \n How in the hell could you possibly organize the militia without knowing for sure what weapons were available? \n\n Require it of each citizen. How many males of that age equals the number of armed Militia. In fact, since you are so inclined, I think this is a great law for you to promote. In fact, I think you would be a citizen to emulate if you did. What do you say, are you up for the job? Or are you more interested in what I have and how many? If it bothers you too much, I invite you over and you can see everything I have, and then I will make you lunch! \n \nAgain, show how a nationwide registration would infringe on any any second amendment rights. \n\n It it a precursor to confiscation. I can think of no greater infringement on the 2nd then providing the Very last Step needed before Confiscation.\n :  Human Rights \n(The following one-pager is taken from the U.S. Department of State publication, Principles of Democracy.)\n \u0095 To maintain human rights, citizens in any free society need to be vigilant. Citizen responsibility - through a variety of participatory activities - ensures that government remains accountable to the people.\n\n If the government knows where and what you have, if a government became rogue the Government would just come and collect them all, and at will. \n   FEDERALIST No. 28 HAMILTON \n If the representatives of the people betray their constituents, there is then no resource left but in the exertion of that \n  original right of self-defense \n which is paramount to all positive forms of government, and which against the usurpations of the national rulers, may be exerted with infinitely better prospect of success than against those of the rulers of an individual state. \n In a single state, if the persons intrusted with supreme power become usurpers, the different parcels, subdivisions, or districts of which it consists, having no distinct government in each, can take no regular measures for defense. \n  The citizens must rush tumultuously to arms, without concert, without system, without resource; except in their courage and despair. \n The usurpers, clothed with the forms of legal authority, can too often crush the opposition in embryo.\n\n \n \nThe president could, in theory, come out of the white house tomorrow morning and order that every person in American present an itemized list of all the arms and ammunition they own so that they could build a database to use in case of foreign invasion and he would be perfectly within his rights as the head of the militia to do it. \n\n There is currently a law that prohibits a government database of gun owners, however he can again make a requirement for you to have such and so. That would be just peachy with me, and probably every gun owner. In fact, I could use a great excuse to purchase another firearm. \n \n However, what you are talking about is Control! Sorry my friend, that is an absolute deal breaker! \n \nDid you not realize that there are RESPONSIBILITIES that come with being an American Citizen, and one of those is militia duty if called upon? Maybe you should have checked into that.\n\n I will ignore the childish flames and instead show you this from our Governments website. \n  Rights and Responsibilities  \n Fundamental Rights\n \n This relationship of citizen and state is fundamental to democracy. In the words of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, written by Thomas Jefferson in 1776:\n \n We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.\n \n More specifically, in democracies, these fundamental or inalienable rights include freedom of speech and expression, freedom of religion and conscience, freedom of assembly, and the right to equal protection before the law. This is by no means an exhaustive list of the rights that citizens enjoy in a democracy, but it does constitute a set of the irreducible core rights that any democratic government worthy of the name must uphold. Since they exist independently of government, in Jefferson's view, these rights cannot be legislated away, nor should they be subject to the whim of an electoral majority.\n\n And here our Government recognizes: \n  Rule of Law: Fundamental Rights of Citizens Democracies exist to serve their people \n Democracies rest on the principle that government exists to serve the people. In other words, the people are citizens of the democratic state, not its subjects.\n",

How many times have you heard about \"having the equipment to be a prostitute\". You would think that gun owners would be able to step past the nonsensical logical fallacies and discuss the issue from a logical standpoint.\n\n Yeah! \n \n Were just stupid! \n   Gun Confiscation in Democratic Societies \nNew Zealand has had some form of firearms registration since 1921. In 1974, all revolvers lawfully held for personal security were confiscated. (Same source as previous paragraph) \n \n In May of 1995, Canada's Bill C-68 prohibited previously legal and registered small-caliber handguns. Current owners of such guns were \"grandfathered,\" which means the guns are to be forfeited upon death of the owner. Bill C-68 also authorizes the Canadian government to enact future weapons prohibitions. \n \n On 10 May 1996, Australia banned most semi-automatic rifles and semi-automatic and pump shotguns. Prior to this law, many Australian states and territories had firearms registration. Owners of these newly outlawed firearms were required to surrender them (with some monetary compensation). All such firearms are to be confiscated and destroyed after a 12-month amnesty program. Roughly 600,000 of an estimated 4 million Australian guns have been surrendered to authorities and destroyed. \n \n \"Since 1921, all lawfully-owned handguns in Great Britain are registered with the government, so handgun owners have little choice but to surrender their guns in exchange for payment according to government schedule...The handgun ban by no means has satiated the anti-gun appetite in Great Britain.\" (All the Way Down the Slippery Slope: Gun Prohibition in England and Some Lessons for Civil Liberties in America\", Hamline Law Review, 1999) \n \n Even in the United States, registration has been used to outlaw and confiscate firearms. In New York City, a registration system enacted in 1967 for long guns, was used in the early 1990s to confiscate lawfully owned semiautomatic rifles and shotguns. (Same source as previous paragraph) The New York City Council banned firearms that had been classified by the city as \"assault weapons.\" This was done despite the testimony of Police Commissioner Lee Brown that no registered \"assault weapon\" had been used in a violent crime in the city. The 2,340 New Yorkers who had registered their firearms were notified that these firearms had to be surrendered, rendered inoperable, or taken out of the city. (NRA/ILA Fact Sheet: Firearms Registration: New York City's Lesson) \n \n More recently, California revoked a grace period for the registration of certain rifles (SKS Sporters) and declared that any such weapons registered during that period were illegal. (California Penal Code, Chapter 2.3, Roberti-Ross Assault Weapons Control Act of 1989 section 12281(f) ) In addition, California has prohibited certain semi-automatic long-rifles and pistols. Those guns currently owned, must be registered, and upon the death of the owner, either surrendered or moved out of state. (FAQ #13 from the California DOJ Firearms Division Page)\n",

I apologize if my statement could be read to suggest others might be soft on crime, for that was not my intent. \n \n Sinjin, I do not have any numbers, recent or otherwise. No one that I know of keeps up with conviction rates (as a percentage of indictments resulting in a conviction). The Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Statistics (Bureau of Justice Statistics Home page) might track that info nationwide, but I have not looked to see. This agency conducts what is probably the best review of nationwide crime statistics. The Virginia State Police manages the VCIN/NCIC records system in my state, and it would be capable of analyzing both arrest and conviction data to report conviction rates. To my knowledge, it does not do so. The agency releases a report every year on crime in Virginia Virginia State Police, but it does not track rates of conviction. I have never asked, but I suspect the reason for ignoring conviction rates is the law officer community's view of \"case cleared by arrest\"-that is, arrest is what we focus on because the arrest ends our job. Contrast this view with the prosecutor's view of \"case cleared by conviction.\" Commonwealth's Attorney's offices can track their own internal data, but there is no statewide reporting system for our offices.\n \n In my experience, prosecution for \"straw man\" sales is very rare because they can rarely be caught. It is far too easy for a purchase to go like this: The felon goes to the gun store one day and looks at a gun he wants-or gets someone else to go look at the gun he wants to price it. The felon waits a few days then gives the money to the \"straw man\" who goes in alone, passes the background check, and gets the gun. The \"straw man\" then leaves and gives the gun to the felon. There is no practical way to stop such purchases. Occasionally you will have two fools who are stupid enough to come in together and have the felon point out the gun he wants the \"straw man\" to buy for him, or have the \"straw man\" give the gun to the felon after purchase while still in the store in front of witnesses. Otherwise, we typically have to rely upon confessions to prosecute \"straw men.\" \n \n Now let me address plea bargaining. In Virginia, each local prosecutor's office sets it own policy regarding plea bargaining. My jurisdiction rarely plea bargains. We just don't see the need for it. Virginia is unique in that it allows the Commonwealth to demand a jury trial and it allows juries to impose the punishment (at least as a recommendation which judges are reluctant to overturn). In a primarily rural community you tend to get a conservative minded (and large sentence leaning) juror. In my jurisdiction 99% of all jury trials happen because the Commonwealth wants one-defendants almost never request one because they are afraid of the jury sentence option (although you see far fewer jury trial demands by prosecutors in large, urban jurisdictions because the jury pool is vastly different).\n \n For cocaine dealers, as an example, we demand jury trials for all cases, and they almost always end up pleading guilty straight up without any plea bargain offer rather than risk a jury sentence. They do so because they know the average sentence statewide from a judge is 12-18 months per cocaine sale charge on a guilty plea (because a judge can suspend time), whereas a jury starts at the statutory minimum five years per charge and can go up to 40 years-and in my experience jurors not only rarely give the minimum but they tend to count by fives (10,15,20,25 years). Judges have the final say over these jury sentence recommendations-they can accept or reject a jury sentence-but judges almost never come behind the \"voice of the people\" and reduce the time they recommend. \n \n I might do a plea bargain once every other year-and then only for cases that require it-like in exchange for providing evidence against others. Otherwise I have rarely found it necessary to plea bargain. Defendants still plead guilty without any plea offer a large proportion of the time because they hope to receive sentencing credit for admitting their wrongs and accepting responsibility for their actions. After all, everything else being equal, the man who pleads guilty and accepts responsibility deserves to serve less time than the man who continues to try to conceal his guilt. \n \n However, I recognize that my jurisdiction is an anomaly. The vast majority of localities plea bargain most of their cases. In some localities the sheer volume of cases requires it-the courts just can't keep up with the number of offenses if every case took the time a full trial requires. In others I suspect plea bargaining results from a combination of the ease for both lawyers taking the path of least resistance combined with a fear of actually trying and possibly losing cases. I know jurisdictions which will plea bargain gun and drug cases by agreeing to drop the gun charge in exchange for a guilty plea to the drug charge. It is tempting for defendants to consider such an offer because the gun charge almost always carries more time than the drug charge-while it is tempting for the prosecutor because he cannot lose a case which is never tried and rather than spend time in court trying a case he can go home early and work on his golf game. I have just never subscribed to the \"Monty Hall-would you like to take what's behind door number 3?\" method of prosecuting cases-and my golf game sucks no matter how much time I spend at it. \n \n But, at least in Virginia, no matter what the plea bargain is, it must be in writing for felony cases, and it is filed in the trial court for all to see. Any \"back room dealing\" which happens in plea bargains must ultimately be put into the record so the public can know what charges were dropped/reduced/sentenced lightly. This may or may not be a requirement in other states.",

   "When I read the article I am about to post, I thought of this, even though it does not exactly fit what Sinjin asked about registration. However, I also said that I could not think of a scenario in which one would need to oppose our Government. Perhaps, in my own financial comfort arrogance, I forgot about what is actually going on. Maybe the threat isn't only about our government.\n \n \n I guess I don't follow how not having specific info on privately held firearms would be anything more than an inconvenience to a rogue government. Couldn't it follow a door to door confiscation strategy to achieve its objectives? Wouldn't your weapons be just as effective in either scenario? Either way they'd be coming heavy, expecting the worst from you. Either way you'd go down. Isn't it the sheer number in private hands at any given time that secures our rights, by your thinking? You know, the whole \"cold dead hands\" sort of thing. \n\n   Gun Owners Send the Government a Message \n One almost can't avoid a news story today about the recent dramatic increase in firearms and ammunition sales. The reason for this as told by almost every gun store owner interviewed is that people \"fear\" that O bama and Congress will ban certain firearms.\n ...\n with an economic collapse as a possibility, anarchy could be the result. Doesn't it seem reasonable to prepare for that eventuality? If that were to happen there will be people who will stop at nothing to take from you what you have, whether it is food, water, gasoline or anything else they can take. They might take from the unprepared.\n \n Some of us are prepared to defend what is ours; the items we will need to survive.\n \n From Rick Santelli and the rest of us peace loving, law-abiding people, the ###### are being told enough is enough. The tea party is about to begin. Just keep pressing the people and we may have to bring back tar and feathers and a rail to run them out of town on.\n \n The arrogance and conceit of the fools in the government is stunning. We've had enough. The people are saying \"I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore.\" It's about time.\n\n \n \n1. We have no need/or right to defend ourselves from the government\n \n (They forget that the people/subjects of Germany, Cambodia, and Colonial America all felt the same at one time) \n \n 2. Personally owned firearms are of no use against a modern military\n \n (The purpose of the Liberator pistol was to shoot a soldier and take his weapon. History is full of examples of partisans holding off significantly larger, better armed troops)\n \n 3. You have no legitimate need for 'Assault Weapons' to defend yourself.\n \n (In this scenario I could think of nothing, short of maybe an SBR, that I would rather have).\n\n \n Perhaps the problem is that we are just too comfortable in a time of need! I also thought of happened in New Orleans, during Katrina, when all guns were confiscated in order to try ANY Solution at all. That might also be an option for a government where the people are out of control as well.",

   "And one more article on topic.\n \n   Democrats have not taken gun control off the table \n Democrats have been trying to reinvent themselves on the gun-control issue since it was a major factor in their loss of control of the House of Representatives in the 1994 election. \n \n Can the Democrat gun-control leopard really change its spots? The record says, unequivocally, no. A look at the White House's own Web site reveals this.\n \n http://www.whitehouse.gov/agenda/urbanpolicy/\n \n Hidden under \"Urban Agenda\" we have calls for \"reasonable gun controls\" such as reimposing the so-called assault weapons ban (rarely used in crimes, not the choice of criminals), closing the alleged gun-show loophole (which doesn't exist - the same laws apply at gun shows as apply everywhere else), repealing the Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (which protects law-abiding firearms manufacturers from frivolous lawsuits), repealing the Tiahrt Amendment (which allows law enforcement full access to gun trace information while preventing its release to politicians for more frivolous lawsuits), making guns \"childproof\" (the so-called \"smart gun,\" which police agencies refuse to adopt for reliability purposes), etc.\n \n As media-proclaimed constitutional law professor (actually, just a lecturer) Obama should know that the Second Amendment isn't about hunting or target shooting. It's about balance of power. The operative word in \"gun control\" is \"control.\" Shortly after the election, an Obama spokesperson made reference to \"ruling,\" not \"governing.\" It's difficult to rule when the people are armed. Ask Adolph Hitler or Joe Stalin.\n \n Obama has a huge task ahead of him, transforming this nation into a copy of socialist Europe. Obama and his Democrat bootlickers on Capitol Hill are already well on their way to selling our children and grandchildren into taxpayer slavery, even as they pay back their special interests with billions hidden in the so-called stimulus package.\n \n Gun control isn't off the table, it's just a little further down the agenda after the budgetary crisis is taken care of. But it's there, waiting for the right moment. Gun-control advocates have a long history of dancing in the blood of victims, using emotional appeal after a highly publicized shooting incident to promote their agenda.\n",

Thanks for making my point again.\n\n \n Have you actually read the militia act of 1792? You keep quoting it, but have apparently not read it. Who provided the weapons for those guys, Tither????? \n \n From the militia act of 1792:\n \n\n That every citizen, so enrolled and notified, shall, within six months thereafter, provide himself with a good musket or firelock, a sufficient bayonet and belt, two spare flints, and a knapsack, a pouch, with a box therein, to contain not less than twenty four cartridges, suited to the bore of his musket or firelock, each cartridge to contain a proper quantity of powder and ball; or with a good rifle, knapsack, shot-pouch, and powder-horn, twenty balls suited to the bore of his rifle, and a quarter of a pound of powder; and shall appear so armed, accoutred and provided, when called out to exercise or into service, except, that when called out on company days to exercise only, he may appear without a knapsack. \n\n \n \nI love the way you and I say the same thing, and yet you create a controversy! I said: PROVIDE for arming the Militia. That is what the Constitution says. \n\n \n I have already shown that is NOT all it says. Even if it WAS, there is a straight line correlation between knowing what arms people already have and effectively providing for arming them. \n \n \nNo apparently not. You claim the President needs to know what is out there. :) However, fallacy in your argument. This,   United States Code, Title 10 Chapter 13. does not say that they only call up gun owners. It says. \"all able-bodied males\". If there is a call, all of the Antis get a green suit too! :) Not just gun owners. It does not say that gun owners have to arm the militia! \n\n \n The fact that the current militia act does not require people to provide their own weapons for use in the militia means nothing AT ALL. Past ones have. Future ones may. You would thing that somebody who quotes the constitution and the founding fathers as often as you do would understand the difference between a constitutional imperative and a law that can be changed pretty much at the whim of congress. \n \n \nHowever, since I know this bugs you, allow me to end this post with more of our Founding words! :)\n  The 9th Amendment\n I think most Americans are ignorant of our Founding words and principles.
