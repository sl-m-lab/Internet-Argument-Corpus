   "This week, we learned that President Bush supports sending American jobs overseas. The White House released a report that said \"When a good or service is produced more cheaply abroad, it makes more sense to import it than to make it or provide it domestically.\"\n \n And one of President Bush's top economic advisers called outsourcing -- when companies fire Americans and send their jobs overseas -- \"a good thing.\"\n \n With that attitude, it's easy to see how Bush can be proud of his record of losing 2.9 million jobs since he took office -- the first president to lose jobs during his term since Herbert Hoover. If sending American jobs overseas is \"a good thing,\" then Bush should be proud of his record of hemorrhaging jobs.\n \n Of course, the millions of Americans who are out of work would disagree.\n \n http://www.democrats.org/action/tellafriend/200402140001.html",

There were jobs out there that people weren't willing to do for the money offered. Solution....Amnesty for illegals. \n \n It is not a question of raising the minimum wage. Minimum wage is only needed in times where there is massive unemployment. There is a 100% accurate way to calculate what a given job should pay. You find out what a qualified employee is willing ot do the job for. This is the cornerstone of capitolism, supply and demand.\n \n I can remember the president giving a speach in 1989 where it was claimed that by 2005, there would be over 5 million excess jobs. I don't see it happening. There is a vast, complex formula they use to calculate job growth. The only thing that you can say for sure about it is that every long range projection EVER has been wrong. \n \n I was discussing this the other day at a brunch that was attended by a couple of senators. One of them said \"I have seen credible reports that show the economy going both ways. Your guess is as good as mine.

In town, we have IBP (Iowa beef) Modine, Caterpillar, Menu Foods, Bunge, and a half dozen machine shops. Every one of them hires illegals on a pretty big scale.\n \n The illegals we get through here usually know how to work with their hands, they know the basics of mechanics (a lot of mexicans still work on their own cars!!) and know how to use basic tools. I have a college kid that is an \"intern\" (read that...low paid slave who is willing to work for half of what the other guys get just to have some experience for his resume). First day, taught him how to use a cordless drill. Second day,m taught him how to hold and swing a hammer properly (the handle is 14\" long, you don't have to hold the 4\" that is closest to the head).\n \n My wife had a dead battery at work the other day. She couldn't only find a single person (there are about 200 people where she works) who had a set of jumper cables, and he didn't have any idea at all how to use them. Her boss was concerned the other day that, since his van made a funny noise when he turned on the heater, the radiator fan was going to fly off, punch through the engine, and enter the cab of the van.\n \n I always stop for people who are broke down on the highway. You would be absolutly amazed how few Americans know where their jack is. Even fewer know how to use it. One guy I stopped to help with a flat tire said \"I got it jacked up, but can't get the bolts off, because the wheel just keeps spinning when I try to break them loose\". \n \n I have yet to see a mexican do a lot of the totally STUPID XXXX I see Americans do on a daily basis, and we have a really big mexican/illegal population around here. Most of the other business owners around here think I am NUTS for not hiring the illegals. They grow up working with their hands, and they know how to do it.",

   "Hmmm.. had a similiar discussion about this at another site. Here are my thoughts on \"job export overseas\":\n \n Manual labour loss to the overseas can indeed be good. It is a good way to make the labour force more efficient, and it also serves to be able to purchase cheaper goods. In the end it will lead to an increase in wages for manual labour the capital/labourer ratio will move in favour for the workers (assumning that the unemployment will dissipate, which is questionable). \n \n But this is assuming that the american capital will stay in the US. If the capital moves elsewhere, there will be no efficiency increase in the US. There will be no wage increase as the capital/labour ratio will stay as it where. In fact, the overall capital/labour ratio will drop (ie less capital). This will effect the overall wage rate negatively. But there will still be cheaper goods of course (possibly negating the wage rate drop), but who will be better off? \n \n While the overall american wellfare may rise (asuming that the unemployment will dissipate and that the new imports doesn`t raise the trade decifit) the workers will probably not be better off, they will most probably be worse off. The public will perhaps be better off (due to cheaper goods) but how much better off they will become is relative to their income (that is; the more you earn, the \"more\" better off you will be by this change). And of course the capital owners will be better off (otherwise they wouldn`t have moved their capital).\n \n Now, you see that there are a lot of assumptions here... If for exammple unemployment does not disipate it will be a costly affair, and if the trade decifit is made even worse it could become a problem for future generation americans. But it could be just fine and dandy as the overall change would probably be positive (providing the assumptions are correct). But if nothing is done to re-distribute the gains it will basicly lead to some get shafted and some is better off. \n \n But then we have the political implications of globally transferable capital and what it does to the democratic self-determination of the nation state. \n \n It is clear that a nations economic wealth/capita is heavily dependant on the capital/labour ratio. It is the amount of capital put into production (both humane capital and machines) that determines the productivity per worker. And as the productivity per worker decides GNP/capita a decrease in capital/labour ratio will effect the GNP/capita negativly.\n \n Now, that would mean that any government, who is concerned with the wellbeing of its citizens should maximize capital accumulation. This is pretty straightforward and could be done in many ways. But, most governments also have certain political aspirations (for example; minimum wages, social security net, defense, right to join labour unions etc), and these political aspirations will both cost money and most probable will have negative effect on the capital owners (as they are paying taxes on their capital, and seldom need to use these services). In a closed system, this will only have marginal effects on the capital accumulation. In an open system it will have much more effect as the capital can be moved to another location where these political aspirations are lower (or non-existant). And as the international system is one of anarchy, it will lead to competition between states over easy moveable capital (ie; a reduction in the political aspirations, or a reduction in the ability for a nations public to decide democraticly how their country should be like). \n \n So in essence, job flight overseas does not nearly pose as a serious problem (assuming alot of things) as capital flight and the political implications of a globally transferable capital. \n \n Phew, sorry for the rant...",

   "I have no opposition to free trade and open economic competition. If we are going too compete with other countries for production jobs they should be held to the same standards. They should be held to pay standards, safety standards, employee benefit standards. \n I do not feel, as I have heard some say that this would impose our way of life on other cultures. I do feel that in order to open our doors to foreign products we should know up front that they atleast are not stealing from our economy. \n \n If 1500 hundred jobs leave the US to a plant in China at a fifth of the labor cost how is that not stealing from our economy.\n \n 1500 jobs, 1500 consumers, at 12.00 dollars an hour that is 37,440,000 stolen from our economy with no recourse.",

   "Well obviously I would say that that hasn't been true... look at the stock market now, look at it in the 1980s... people weren't and aren't really looking for other investments because other markets have not yet even stabazlied following the global recession... Germany almost dipped back into negative growth last quarter.\n \n And that money isn't taken from our economy either... it's profit into a coporation's bank account or distributed to shareholders. \n \n If we don't take advantage of India and China, well, everyone else will, and we'll be left behind. Chinese workers don't make a lot from our point of view... but that's good money for them, and they've got a job they otherwise wouldn't have. That's why the Chinese government has been so welcoming of international corporations. And the software engineer in India who makes $10,000 a year is pretty happy too. \n \n I don't think these countries can jump from their level of economic activity to a post-industrial economic stucture. It's just not going to happen... it's a gradual process of improvement. Certainly it will be faster for them, but it's absurd to say they won't have to go through what every other industrialized nation went through.",

The fact that the overseas markets have not yet stabilised is what makes it enticing to those who can afford to loose a little money in search of a huge return (we are talking people with 100's of millions of dollar). THe American market is primarily overvalued. In order to calculate a companies \"real\" stock value, you basically add all their assets, subtract all their debts, and divide by the number of outstanding shares. Very few american companies come out well on this comparison. In the more volatile overseas markets, it is till possible to pick up bargain stocks. I bought some stock the other day ont he japanese exchange that is undervalued by almost 400%. Even if the stock market was to crash, this has very little bearing on the real world value of the stock. Even if the company closed up shop tommorow and liquidated, I would be 400% ahead.\n \n As far as money disapearing and corporate bank accounts, this is a viable point. LArge account holders do not keep their money in US banks. By shopping aruond, it is not difficult to find banks on the international scene that offer 12% interest on accounts. When GM moves 4 billion dollars offshore, it is GONE as far as the US economy is concerned. What they do is take their total overseas interest and issue half of it as a dividend to their investors. It is important to note when listing assets, many (in fact, most large) companies include \"domestic funds\". Getting information in international funds is like pulling teeth. This is because they generally pay dividends from part of the interest recieved on international accounts. they are making 12% on 15 billion in international accounts, they earmark half of that for dividends (6%) and they are still socking away 6% interest. \n \n Of course, those billions of dollars are no longer spurring the american economy. They have been removed. For all the good it is doing us, they may as well burn it. This is because money in the bank is not just sitting, it is working. The bank takes your money and loans it to other people (which is how you get interest). All those billions of dollars are not available to lend.",
