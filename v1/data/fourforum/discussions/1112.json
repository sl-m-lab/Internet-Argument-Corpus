   "We're seeing the effects of the Bush tax cuts already. Citing more projected revenues as companies take record profits, the deficit is now projected to 390 billion from 450 billion- 500 billion. That's why I wanted to... attack that Democrat who made the radio address... that projection was out, and he still cited a 500 billion dollar figure! Also, he said it was the biggest deficit ever. In dollars, yes. As percent of GDP, it's half as big. I'm getting tired of their spin.\n \n This means a lot... most importantly, job growth. Companies are actually booking their biggest profits ever this year. Kind of surprising, isn't it? They're set to make about a trillion dollars in profits. This means that the job cuts that spurred these profits were unneeded and we're going to see a wave of hiring. We already have 55,000 gained jobs last month.\n \n So... what do you think? As the economy improves, where do you think the deficit is headed? I've seen speculation that next year it could narrow to 200 billion or less... what do you think?",

   "I'm willing to cut Bush some slack because he has to deal with the war on terrorism as well as an inherited weak economy that was hurt after 9/11 but eventually he does have to balance the budget. A deficit of $390 billion is better than a $500 billion deficit but it still isn't all that great. We have to get this under control or there will be consequences in the future.\n \n I'm glad to see the economy rebounding a little bit but it also still has a ways to go. We are cheering everything the unemployment number doesn't go up but I await the relief of seeing it start to go down again. I'm not sure how far off this joyous event will be but I hope it is before the next election or I may be tempted to vote against Bush.\n \n Economic improvement should increase taxes and in turn help decrease the budget deficit but Bush has to avoid spending all the new revenues from taxes in order to have that actually work. Hopefully he will eventually get a budget surplus to help make up for these deficits while maintaining a strong economy.",

   "It's a trend that started under Clinton, and it's not going to end. It's going to be a problem for all future administrations until we've reached a fully automated system...\n\n \n I don't buy into that. We have had increasing automation for decades now and even back then people thought that all jobs would eventually be automated within their lifetimes and that unemployment would just keep increasing. In reality the unemployment levels have been decreasing to levels that were thought to be impossible back then. The reason it hasn't increased is because humans are able to do complex and intellectual work while machines only do repetitive and mindless work.\n \n Our capitalist free market system is well setup to handle increasing automation as well. As more money is made through cheap and efficient automation prices will come down in order to be more competitive. This increases customer demand and productivity so demand on raw materials as well as higher-level tasks such as sales, advertising, and management will increase. This increases the amount of people needed to run the company and create more jobs. This is where the computer field that I work in came from. With more automation comes a greater need to create more automation, gather data, create systems for automation, and maintain these systems.\n \n I'd like to see the statistic that shows that the number of jobs that are available to people will decrease because of increasing automation. In certain fields it may decrease but it is going to also increase jobs in other fields.\n \n The day that automation takes over completely is a long ways off and I'm not going to cut Bush slack on the economy because of the automation threat to our system. If it is becoming a problem then there will be ways to deal with it now and in the future. Having our people at work will not only allow the US to be more productive but it will also help our system remain stable. Bush will have to manage to find a way to do this or he will be replaced by someone who will.",

   "The problem is that those jobs aren't being created, and automation doesn't create more jobs than it eliminates. The losses have been big for years in manufacturing, and it's not going to change. How do you save manufacturning? Make automation illegal? What can you do? I'd really like to know. The only thing I've heard is that we should hand money to industry to keep those jobs. That hurts our productivity and it's expensive. I don't think we should try to save it, it's doomed. \n \n Service jobs aren't being created like they used to be. That's going to change with the huge, record-breaking corporate profit this quarter. I wouldn't be surprised to see at least 1.5 million jobs created by next election.\n \n And you need to seperate the economy and jobs... the economy is doing great.
