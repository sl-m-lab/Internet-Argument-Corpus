   "One says that government in France violates citizens' constitutional rights as a result of anti terrorism legislation toughening. As for me we'd rather have fewer freedoms but more security. The fact is that France has huge Muslims community in EU and unfortunately they are acting blazingly in here. In Muslim blocs where Chechens live our police don't want to appear actually. It will be better to send some part of Chechens to...Poland :) . Arabs and Indus to GB because they have accustomed to live side by side from colonial time immemorial. And only after it we will be free and our freedoms will be okay with security under control.",
