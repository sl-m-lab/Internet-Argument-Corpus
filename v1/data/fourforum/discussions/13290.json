   "I keep seeing headlines and articles that seem to put Christians, Republicans and Public-Healthcare-Opposers all in one group together, which is either totally unfair and biased, or suggests that there are a lot of Christians who are actually opposed to a public health care system... I find this a little worrying and confusing, and so write this not as evangelism to non-Christians (you guys can stop reading now...), but as evangelism to conservative Christians, who I ask to turn off Fox News and pick up their bible and see what you find in there about the matter...\n \n The old question of WWJD (What Would Jesus Do?) may be a little dorky and a little clich\u00e9d, but for a Christian it's often a good way to start thinking about moral/ethical dilemmas, or even simple every day scenarios.\n \n Now I for one can't believe that Jesus would be against the public health care option, and I can't imagine too many people who could honestly say he would be. He asks us to love our neighbour, enemy and friend alike, to help the sick and lame no matter what the social, financial or potentially life-threatening cost (i.e. the parable of the Good Samaritan). He is quite specific about giving away wealth, rather than hoarding it. Jesus would be in favour of the entire public paying what they can afford, towards the spiritual and physical care of their peers.\n \n Now I'm not quite saying that Jesus would be in favour of raising taxes. After all, he was clearly not a fan of the Roman Empire and their over-taxing of the poor. But his problem was with the Empire taxing poor people to increase the divide between poor and wealthy. He was against the continual exploitation of his people. And by \"his people\" I am of course referring especially to the meek, the poor, the poverty stricken, the injured, the lame, the sick. It's not that Jesus was only gunning for the sick and lame, but he made a point of trying to bring a voice to those without one.\n \n If Jesus were around today, he would be spending his time helping those without any health care or insurance (probably in quite a different way to Obama, to be totally honest - he would want to wholly subvert the system, rather than work within it). The Pharisees of his time would be today's Middle America, Republicans and Democrats alike, for they participate in an Empire where success is measured financially and socially, rather than through servitude and grace.\n \n Jesus was not a capitalist. The 'Free Market' is not a Christian construct.\n \n It saddens me to see conservative Christians in America using the language of Christ along side the language of capitalism, as if one is ethically and spiritually aligned with the other. As if some how Jesus wants you to be a wealthy CEO. Equally, I don't think Jesus would strictly align with any of the political ideologies that are commonly believed to be inherently \"evil\", like Socialism/Communism/Fascism (BTW, they're not all the same thing).\n \n Large chunks of the New Testament deal with the Roman Empire and how it oppresses and mistreats the people of God. In today's world, the Empire is the extreme capitalist movement in America. The leader and army of today's empire are the extremely wealthy CEOs/managers/etc and massive companies and markets where people are encouraged to consume more and more, and care only for themselves. Capitalism is the new Imperial Cult.\n \n I think it's best summed up a quote from the J-man himself on the topic of taxation - \"Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's\".\n \n Taxation and wealth should not be concerns for Christians. Jesus asks us to give our lives to helping others and to worshiping God. I personally cannot fathom how one can be anti-public-healthcare while following Jesus' teachings.\n\n A message to Christians who oppose Public Health Care, from a fellow Christian: Read more Bible. Watch less Fox News. : reddit.com\n \n I found this an interesting commentary on a Christian perspective of healthcare...",

PERIOD!!!\n \n Nothing else you said is worthy of a response since it ignores my original argument.\n \n It is yet another government bureaucracy which will accomplish nothing real for the people it is intended to help while further centralizing political power in Washington DC. The only real and sure way that an overhaul of the healthcare system in america will actually succeed is if washington gets wise enough to realize that it must get completely out of the way of healthcare and allow insurance companies to actually compete across state lines for the premium dollars which are available. \n \n This way insurance carriers which limit benefits and coverage while charging high premiums will be forced out of the industry because people will purchase programs which serve their needs more completely and efficiently. It is by following a free market philosophy rather than a nationalized/centralized/socialist philosophy which will repair Healthcare and prevent the inevitable waiting lines and all of the other negative outcomes which will result from this government intrusion into yet another private sector industry which it has no business intruding in. \n \n I challenge you to prove your support and defense for nationalized healthcare is well placed by pointing to any government program or bureaucracy which actually saves money, makes a profit or creates a more efficient system over what previously existed. Go on foundit; you can put this debate to bed and win it right now by producing evidence that the government has ever accomplished what they are once again claiming this program will accomplish.\n \n Now let the waffling, the obfuscation and the excuses flow as you attempt to justify your warped and distorted opinion that it is we christians who are being selfish and self centered for rejecting the lies this grand child of Nazism, known officially in German as National Socialism (German: Nationalsozialismus), which refers to the totalitarian ideology and practices of the Nazi Party or National Socialist German Workers&#8217; Party under Adolf Hitler, and the policies adopted by the dictatorial government of Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1945. This is what allowing the government to take control of such a massive percentage of our economy will accomplish foundit, and you know how Naziism treated homosexuals. So the question is, why are you supporting an ideology which will eventually turn on you also?",

Postal officials attributed the increase to last May's postage increase. Total mail volume during the quarter declined 3 percent; with First-Class Mail being particularly affected, declining by 3.9 percent.\n \n Postmaster General John Potter blamed the economy, rather than the ever-increasing cost of postage, for the downturn in mail volume. \"The economic downturn was the main factor for the volume decline, as the hard-hit financial and housing sectors are heavy users of the mail,\" he said in a press release. \"I&#8217;m proud our managers and employees adjusted quickly to these changing market conditions, making a positive quarterly net income possible. Not only did they help us tighten our belt, but they provided record levels of service.\"\n \n USPS also reduced its operating expenses for the first quarter to $19.7 billion, down from $22.7 billion for the same period last year. Fuel and labor costs remained unchanged despite serving an additional 1.7 million new delivery addresses. The USPS now provides daily mail service to 146 million American homes and businesses.\n The USPS HAS DONE ALL THREE!\n And note, the above was what was happening with the Post Office BEFORE the recession hit!\n Just because you can point (DURING A MASSIVE RECESSION) to a period where they have lost money doesn't mean squat. emoticon_emb",

   "Really? I need to let this go? I think not; because what this exchange reveals is that the only 2 years in the past 32, according to that article you posted was written, occurred during the BUSH ADMINISTRATION NO LESS, and were the ONLY 2 YEARS THAT THE USPS SHOWED A PROFIT. And it hasn't shown one since then either, which is why I asked you to show when the last time it produced a profit was. Because to be totally candid, I didn't think it ever showed a profit.\n\n Which is mind-bogglingly stupid cause the article OPENLY STATES it has made a profit.\n \n And as I explained, its recent problems are because of the CURRENT BAD ECONOMY which have been damaging companies across the board.\n \n But you keep trying to move the goal-posts.\n You originally challenged: \"...pointing to any government program or bureaucracy which actually saves money, makes a profit or creates a more efficient system over what previously existed.\"\n \n I have shown the United Postal Service doing\n 1) saving money,\n 2) making a profit,\n 3) creating a more efficient system over what previously existed.\n \n It has done all three.\n \n \n \nBut here's the excerpt from your own link.Nonetheless, \"2004 and 2005 are the first two years that the USPS showed an actual profit since the Postal Service was reorganized in 1971,\" says Strasser. \"The prior 32 years all produced deficits.\" emoticon_xgoodThe point is that government bureaucracies don't make profits. They aren't designed to make profits as they produce services and were intended to produce those services by utilizing tax dollars supplied by we the people.\n\n Thank you for providing the rational for why your demand WAS MEANINGLESS IN THE FIRST PLACE...\n \n \n \nAnd those services are intended to serve we the people. But this nationalized healthcare program doesn't do that.\n\n See, THIS is where you just get ridiculously bizarre.\n Arguing things that BOGGLE MY MIND along the original point of this article...\n \n To me, a Christian demanding that the \"nationalized healthcare program\" has to be about profit is amazing.\n Absolutely amazing.\n And not in a good way.\n Demanding that profit be made off of people's illnesses???\n emoticon_frazzled\n \n Perhaps the \"Good Samaritan\" story needed a FIFTH person who insisted that the Good Samaritan shouldn't help the injured person unless there was profit in it for him...\n emoticon_angry\n \n Not even Jesus in giving that parable imagined such vile evilness...\n \n \n \nIt will make the american people nothing more than surfs and indentured servants to this bloated and self serving government which seeks to harness political power at the expense of the people it was created to serve.\n\n emoticon_wow\n Yeah.\n JUST LIKE THE UNITED POSTAL SERVICE has made us all \"surfs and indentured servants\" cause it helps get our letters from point A to point B.\n < end sarcasm <\n \n I swear.\n The fact that you actually think you said something intelligible boggles my mind.\n Obama giving an ALTERNATIVE to people to help ensure that they don't become destitute by healthcare bills is what will damage us...\n emoticon_angry",

   "Pardon the multi-post reply. I was drag racing this weekend and not on the computer.\n \n \nMost people don't see most of the fruits of their labour. That's how capitalism works - the accumulation of the value of the labour of working people. There's a reason why, until the early 90s, the UK labour party included this aim in its constitution:\n \"To secure for the workers by hand or by brain the full fruits of their industry\"\n This seems like what you're saying, but I think what you mean is \"I want to keep my gross pay whether it's the result of my labour or that of others, and screw anyone who has been less fortunate than me, unless I deem them deserving enough of my charity\".\n\n \n I can see why the UK changed its wording. I would have expected a hammer and sickle along with that verbiage. emoticon_wow\n \n As for the second part of your post, you're not that far off. If it wasn't for the risk-takers that invested their capital in industry in the first place, the workers, who risked NOTHING, wouldn't have a job. With risk comes rewards. That's how Capitalism works. \n \n \nYikes. That is most definitely not how capitalism works.\n\n \n emoticon_xgood\n \n \nI agree, most of them end up taxed or inflated away.\n\n \n Only because we have become sheeple that allow it to occur. If we forced our gov't to operate under a fixed budget, made individuals pay their OWN taxes via a monthly check made out to Uncle Sam, instead of making the employer a tax collector, we might see some change. Too many people look only at their take home pay and forget about the legal theft that is occurring monthly.\n \n \nEven when taxes were minimal and we were on the gold standard, shareholders were still making a lot of money off the backs of working people.\n\n \n You mean that shareholders reaped the rewards of their risked capital. Remember, a poor man doesn't create jobs; he creates the anti-thesis.",

   "Henry Ford was an enlightened employer in some ways, pricing his product within the financial reach of his employees, but he made his fortune from selling that product for more than he paid his employees to produce it. Any employer makes his (and the shareholders) profit from paying the employees less than the value of their work.\n\n \n What is the value of \"invention\" and \"risk\" in your twisted mind, ZERO? emoticon_wow\n \n \nSo that's how it works...wow!\n\n \n Only in the minds of socialists. \n \n \nBut it is not just \"the value of their work.\" Any good or service requires multiple factor inputs, including, but not limited to, labor. It makes no more sense to say workers are being shorted the \"full value\" of their work because capitalists buy their labor than it is to say capitalists are being shorted the \"full value\" of what is theirs because workers are making use of their capital, or landlords of their land. To the owner of each factor goes its marginal product (under competitive conditions), so workers are being shorted nothing.\n \n Hence the illogic of Jo suggesting a laborer is being shortchanged simply by virtue of his being worker. This would only be true if goods and services were produced by labor in a complete vacuum.\n\n \n I'm impressed. It's refreshing to see that someone else has chosen to study the invisible hand as opposed to Marxism. emoticon_xgood\n \n \nHow do the landlords and capitalists come by their capital, what gives someone the right to own more land than they can themselves put to use? Capital is simply the accumulation of the labour of previous workers. Now, I'm not denying that management and leadership have value, but there is no reason that day to day running of a company should be rewarded exponentially higher than doing the productive work of that company. It's clearly nothing to do with talent, as the salaries paid to failed banking bosses indicate, it about the structure of the economy. Successful companies have been founded on other models, but certainly the British legal systems make them difficult to implement as the law assumes certain structures of hierarchical leadership. The Co-operative Group, John Lewis Partnership, Suma, Nationwide Building Society, all show that other ways are possible, and just as if not more effective than the capitalist alternative.\n \n\n \n In your country, land was given by Kings and Queens for service rendered to the crown. In the US, land was doled out based on one's willingness to take risks and stake claims in remote areas, for the most part. We didn't have the luxury of getting ours by sucking up to royals. ;)\n \n\n The caveat of competitive conditions makes a mockery of any claim to fairness in a capitalist system. Capitalist models assume perfect information and free movement of labour, both of which are totally untrue. The cost of transportation makes free movement of labour a myth, and the uncertainties of finding and transferring to a new job, with the prospect of unemployment in between, mean moving between even locally available jobs is hard for those at the bottom of the ladder. Additionally, people are not paid by the value that they add, but at the minimum their employer can get away with paying someone with their skills. Anyone who has ever been in the situation of negotiating salary at a job interview knows how unbalanced that situation is unless you are very sure of yourself.\n\n \n I'd argue that the unwillingness to move to a better labor market is due to the worker's conscious decision to avert risk, the very thing that the employer had to do to create the job in the first place. Capitalism is a system of risks and rewards which, until recently, was fairly well understood.\n The recent banking debacle transformed our capitalist nation into something much more sinister, IMO, a controlled economy.\n We now have Uncle Sam telling companies how to operate, how much to pay their execs, what types of cars to build, etc., It is as far from a free market as the US has ever strayed. emoticon_frazzled\n \n \n \nWhich is mind-bogglingly stupid cause the article OPENLY STATES it has made a profit.\n \n And as I explained, its recent problems are because of the CURRENT BAD ECONOMY which have been damaging companies across the board.\n \n But you keep trying to move the goal-posts.\n You originally challenged: \"...pointing to any government program or bureaucracy which actually saves money, makes a profit or creates a more efficient system over what previously existed.\"\n \n I have shown the United Postal Service doing\n 1) saving money,\n 2) making a profit,\n 3) creating a more efficient system over what previously existed.\n \n It has done all three.......\n\n \n If a company that holds a monopoly and gets to set its own prices can't make money then something's wrong.

You continue to defend your original point which implied that the governments claims that it could efficiently run a healthcare plan in spite of the fact that the one example you offered of government efficiency has been proven by you, yourself to only have made a profit twice in 32 years since it was reorganized in 71. And why was it reorganized in 71? Because it hadn't shown a profit for the previous 30 years or so. \n \n \nAnd as I explained, its recent problems are because of the CURRENT BAD ECONOMY which have been damaging companies across the board.\n\n \n Problem is foundit, your own linked article shows it isn't a recent problem at all but is endemic within the system to the tune of losing billions of dollars per year on average.\n \n \nBut you keep trying to move the goal-posts.\n You originally challenged: \"...pointing to any government program or bureaucracy which actually saves money, makes a profit or creates a more efficient system over what previously existed.\"\n\n \n Right, but I didn't mean to show that they did it for one or two years out of their entire existence. I wanted you to offer up a government bureaucracy which accomplishes that as a regular practice. So stop defending a loser and just admit that no government bureaucracy is designed to make a profit, much less accomplishes that goal.",

   "Still trying to play a losing hand, I see. emoticon_xdonno\n \n \n Maybe now you can see that you're trying to use the exception as the rule. The majority of businesses are small businesses. The majority of small business owners risk their entire life's savings and as you can see 30% don't make it past 2 years.\n\n \n Which has nothing at all to do with what I'm saying. Can we assume you can't actually respond to my point and therefore are attacking something else?",

   "I've always wondered how they found the mailboxes. ;)\n\n iPhones.\n Lots and lots of iPhones.\n There's an app for that!\n \n \n \nMy argument was just an academic one. Any company that is a government-run monopoly shouldn't lose money. It's too easy to change the rules of the game. \n\n And like I said, IF THAT WERE THEIR GOAL, they could do it.\n Give them more control over setting their own own policies, instead of demanding that they do all sorts of things that \"society\" thinks would be good to have done. Their prices are set, responsible to review by the tax-payers. Give them the power to hike their prices like the gas companies do ( emoticon_rolleyes yes I know it's more complicated than JUST that ), and you'll see appropriate profit lines.\n \n Do you see UPS or FedEX giving free shipping to the blind?\n Do you see UPS or FedEX opening up cheap delivery of junk mail across the nation?\n No. But companies can take advantage of the Post Office's low mailing prices and achieve just that.",
