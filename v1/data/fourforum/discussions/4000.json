   "No body understand occupation better than the Arabs in the entire whole world. \n \n While the word occupation by itself is a bad word if it is used in the contest of occupying someone else's country; Arabs and not Arabized used this word only to imply that all the occupied countries are the non Moslem countries of the world. \n You hear them claiming today that they are the aboriginals of the entire Middle East and North Africa; that only Israel is the occupying power there, but the truth is, they only say that because Arabs and Islamists never used occupation in their entire life, they only used submission instead. \n \n Come to look at it at close range, occupation implies temporary stance and therefore the occupied force must leave as a result of not fitting in; Arabs always played and still playing for keep. \n \n Therefore don't be surprise in case you heard them today again saying that they are the aboriginals of Australia, Spain, Serbia, Cyprus, Malta, Philippine, Nigeria, South Sudan, and the rest of the world including recently their claim of being the real natives of America because Islamists always plan ahead in accordance with the old vision their prophet have for them that implies No non-Moslem can govern Moslems. \n \n Since knowledge come from either theory or practice by which you build skills; for the entire past fourteen centuries, Arabs as Islamists practiced on submitting others using every single method revealed to them in the Koran, but never ever occupied any country and that why no one left to point to them, and that is a skill in my opinion. \n \n No entity, organization, or government in the entire world is qualified to argue with them about the subject of occupation, because they were, still now, and they will be the masters of occupations for many generations to come. \n \n Through every means in our laws they insert theirs, through every means of our civility and social behaviour they insert theirs, and through every means of our religious tolerance they insert their religion as a religion of peace, which is very convenient with our Multiculturalism, but to tell you the truth; their culture doesn't mix well with ours because it's cocooned with religious parameters that states reformists are apostates. \n \n How long it took those ancient Middle Eastern and North African to become Arabized? \n \n Generations... And that how long it will take our culture to be totally Arabized? \n \n No one paid attentions in Serbia, Cyprus, and Lebanon for the baby steps, but the results were as always; first, half the country, and the future will tell how far this will go. And I don't mean the seen future here because as you remember this submission is played through many, many generations. \n \n \"The Mothers of All Battles\" that is being fought without mercy all around the globe are to be considered here nothing more than the extended Jihad that Islamists of the past handed its torch to the Islamists of the present, and that by itself holds the secret of why moderate Arabs and Moslems in general are not participating forcefully against it as fighters of extremisms. \n \n In order for them to represent the true Islam according to what we think and what everyone think they should be doing, they will face treason charges even from some of their moderate supporters (Salman Rushdie, and Musharaf are examples), and that just because all moderates will still be living amongst the majority of the Islamists extremisms who are ready to carry on any Fatwa. \n \n After all, isn't it the issuers of these Fatwas are the ones you expect to be the moderate? \n \n Looking around into the world of Islam make me admits and says what a great successful concept \"turn other people to become the Arab like you.\" \n \n Did you ever hear of better occupation than this, I know, I didn't yet... \n \n Do you think I am exaggerating here? \n \n Just scan their history, they came out of HIJAZ spread all over the Middle East, North Africa, and crossed to Europe Spain were they were stopped and forced to recline back. \n \n You want evidence, I'll give you evidence... \n \n Take a look at Malta TODAY, and ask yourself why and how the Maltese language changed from 100% Italian to 90% Arabic 10% Italian? \n \n Arab only use Occupation as a horror word against Israel to play on the Rosy minded who think they are civilized but have no clue about what the history of civilization went through with the Arab submitters up until today. \n \n Those denialists either have no clue how Arabs submitted with invasion the entire Middle East and North Africa, and how they swallowed every civilization in their way and claimed its achievements as theirs, or they are thinking that this is a right wing exaggeration. \n \n I'll tell you one thing, either way they are going to be surprised. Which make me wonder, is there any one in this world of ours has the guts to stand in the face of Arabia and say, \n \n what about the Arab Occupation? \n \n \n \n jack the human",
