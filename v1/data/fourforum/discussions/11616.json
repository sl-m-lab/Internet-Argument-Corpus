   "Sen. Phil Gramm, finance adviser to McCain, was the author of the particular piece of deregulation which facilitated this disaster. Clinton was no longer in office at the time.\nThe whole concept of 'giving' loans to unqualified borrowers under shady payback rules started with Jimmy Carter. Bill Clinton made it worse. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have provided millions of dollars in personal income to those appointed to run them. They need some regulation.\n \n Since this is from a liberal magazine, the proximate cause -- the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (JC's administration), amended/liberalized in 1995 (BJC's administration) and used as a club over Wall Street's head by the Dems in Congress -- is not mentioned, but it does show the key to the companies' collapsing versus their being able to weather the loan crisis.\n \n http://www.newyorker.com/talk/financial/2008/09/29/080929ta_talk_surowiecki\n \n You can blame all this on Bush if you will, but the seed was planted by Democrat Jimmy Carter and the plan was made more lineate by Democrat Bill Clinton. That it took thirty years to come to a head is no fault of anyone in the current administration.",

It is coincidental that 30 years after Carter opened the vaults that the problem festers into a running sore. (Can you see a lot of the 30 year mortages coming due for thousands of people who shouldn't have been loaned the money in the first place?) It has little to do with Bush policies. It has more to do with Democratic socialism.",
