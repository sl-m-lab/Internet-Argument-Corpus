   "I no longer want to hear anyone use Scott Ritter as a credible source of information regarding war in Iraq. This man has been discredited on many fronts.\n \n 1.) He was under investigation for espionage for giving sensitive information to the Israelis during his time as a weapons inspector for UNSCOM.\n \n 2.) He has taken money from an Iraqi businessman to produce a sympathetic piece on Iraq.\n \n Scott Ritter took $800,000 from Iraqi businessman.\n \n 3.) Scott Ritter is an admitted sex offender, and it is possible that the Iraqis blackmailed him with the thought of an embarrassing public disclosure of this fact.\n \n NY Daily News: Yuck!",

   "I am glad that is out in the open. I was wondering why he changed his stance on Iraq so suddenly, if I remember right he was one of the ones saying we should go to war immediatly and then did a complete 180 and said that we should not. I hope he has to have a bilboard in his yard saying that he is a sex offender. He should not get off easy at all.",
