   "...can be extended to the destruction of the freedom of religion.\n \n The War on Drugs is based on the idea that people have no right to harm themselves. This principle, when applied consistently, leads a Christian to conclude that Christianity must be forced on the people, as not being Christian leads to the ultimate harm of damnation. In fact, if someone embraces both Christianity and the logic of the War on Drugs, the prohibition of non-Christianity is in fact much more important than the prohibition of pot, as eternal punishment is much more harmful than a little brain damage.\n \n Similarly, some argue that drugs must be prohibited because they cause people to waste their lives. If an atheist embraces this twisted logic, then he must conclude that the government should prohibit all religions, as religions advocate self-denial, encourage people to waste time in worship, and prevent people from living life to the fullest.\n \n So, before we embrace the twisted principles behind the War on Drugs, we must consider what they imply when applied consistently. In this case, a consistent application of War on Drugs principles would run up against the Constitution. Of course, the government could continue to hold a logically inconsistent, fence-straddling policy as it currently does with regard to self-ownership.\n \n How about consistent principles that don't run up against the Constitution? How about the principle that everyone has the right to live his own life without unwanted interference from others? Or is that too much to ask?",

   "How can \"culture\" be harmed? Culture is a non-entity.\n Your culture is how you interact with other members of your community. When a culture is harmed, the individuals who participate in that community are harmed by extension.\n \nGodel's theorems basically state that consistent theories can't prove themselves to be consistent. They do not state that all theories are inconsistent.\n Indeed. I didn't call it proof, but rather evidence. \n \n If no system can be proven to be consistent by its own lights, and instead requires a meta-framework to prove its consistency, then you can never prove the consistency of all frameworks because you'll always need to prove the consistency of each justificatory standard. What Godel's theorums imply is that there is no proof of consistency that is not question-begging. If we cannot prove something consistent by its own rules and can only prove something consistent by begging the question, then it looks like we cannot prove any system is consistent. If we cannot prove any system consistent, then no system is consistent. This isn't a proof because there may be a way to prove the consistency of a system that doesn't involve the internal/external proof scheme. \n \n Oh, and of course, if you extend a system far enough you'll arrive at a contradiction through construction, but that's cheating. \n \nI am not talking about maximizing the utilitarian good of only one individual at the expense of others - that would mean setting up that individual as a dictator.\n Neither am I. Indeed, that's only the second worst outcome in the PD. Where everyone tries to maximize their utility is the worst outcome because everyone has to do so at the great expense of others.\n \nThe problem you face is that harm is defined by the individual, as individuals have different preferences.\n Sorry, but I think you're mistaking the fact that individuals can only define what they perceive to be harm with the definition of harm itself which is communally defined. \n \nThe pot-head, for example, smokes pot because doing so increases his happiness as defined by him. To interfere with him decreases his happiness, without objectively increasing the happiness of anyone else.\n Happiness, unfortunately, is quite distinct from the moral good and even prudence. The fact that the pot-head enjoys smoking pot entails neither the prudence of doing so, nor the rightness of doing so. It may be the case that it is prudent, moral, or both, but it is only contingently so. \n \nThere is nothing moral in interfering in the individual's right to make choices in matters that only affect himself.\n I disagree. Even when a person is a complete stranger and totally isolated from a community it may be moral to save him from doing really stupid things to himself. Obviously, on utilitarian grounds the harm involved must be greater than the harm involved in that interference, but that counts on deontological, social-contract, and virtue-based grounds as well.\n \nIf so, the War on Drugs is immoral. It is nothing more than a mean-spirited crusade to reduce the happiness of the pot-heads.\nUnfortunately no man is an island, as the saying goes, and the happiness of pot-heads counts for little in the moral scheme of things. Not to mention that the 'War on Drugs' is also intended to reduce the use of much more dangerous drugs such as cocaine and heroin. What might count against the morality of the 'War on Drugs' is the ham-fisted methodology that it uses to produce more harm than good, but not its intentions. It certainly is well-intentioned, but good intentions (as John Rawls points out) cannot be the sum of morality. \n \n More to the point, I don't think that the 'logic' of the 'War on Drugs' is easily transferable to things such as alien ideologies, as the 'War on Drugs' depends on a combination of very real and visible harm caused by the hard drugs, and people's ignorance of the proper use and etiquette of the soft drugs.",

   "Do you have any idea what you are talking about? A culture cannot be harmed.\n Cultures can be harmed, especially through changes in language, loss of traditions, and the encroachment of alien ideas. A culture is harmed when its facilitation of community activity is impaired. For example, you can harm a culture by forcing the community holding that culture to change their language or adopt a new one. The exertion of that force interferes with the community members' ability to participate in their culture, degrading its efficacy as a tool for social order. This is much like a knife may be harmed if sharpened on an unsuitable whetstone, a culture may be harmed by changes in its influences. \n \nThat is fallacious.\n Okay. Care to tell us why it is fallacious? I'm well aware that the inability to prove something ordinarily doesn't count against there actually being something to prove, but because consistency is something defined by our ability to prove it, a proof by contradition appears to stand.\n \nYou do know that the Prisoner's Dilemma is not a reflection of a free society? It is a scenario where individuals MUST interfere with the lives of others.\n No, I'm saying that the Prisoner's Dilemma is a model of free societies precisely because the individuals must make a choice about how they are to interfere with each other's lives. Any society, however free, is still a concourse of competing interests. As Karl Popper would point out, a society free of competing interests would be a society of ants and not of humans. \n \nReally? So a Christian community can define atheism as harmful, eh?\n I think you may be misunderstanding what I meant by communities defining harm. Communities are the context by which harm is defined - no intentional or active sense should be taken to be implied by this statement. Atheism may indeed be harmful to a Christian community, because not because some entity call 'the community' decided that it was so\n \nHarm is subjective. What one person regards as harmful may be regarded as helpful by another (for example, conversion to Islam.) The only basis for defining harm is the individual basis, through the system of title and consent.\n I think that you're confusing that fact that harm may be perceived subjectively with the objective fact of harm. That's my fault though for not cutting to the heart of the matter:\n \n Perception is subjective, and fact is objective. \n \n The fact that individuals have different preferences does not entail that harm is subjective, but merely that the perception of harm is subjective. \n \n This perception of harm is also made in the cultural context of the community. But to also confuse this perception of harm with harm itself is also a mistake. \n \nWhat entitles you, or anyone, to judge what the pot-head should do to his own body? If you know anything about choice theory, utils are defined subjectively, and just because you see negative utils in smoking pot does not mean everybody does.\n Moral obligation 'entitles' us, regardless of our perception of it, or the mode in which we understand it. Good manners also requires that we tell the pot-head and the rest of the community our judgment so that it may be subject to peer-review. Judging the pot-head's actions is very important because doing so gives us good morals grounds for formulating a response to the pot-head's behaviour. Such judgment will establish which is worse, either the harm that smoking pot does or the harm that preventing people from smoking pot when they responsibly choose to. \n \n Personally I think that preventing certain people from responsibly using marijuana is more harmful than criminalizing it, and certain others should be prevented from using it at all. \n \nWhat if the stranger does not perceive what he does to himself as harmful?\n Then the stranger is an idiot and doubly in need of protection. \n \nOh, right, and the authorities magically know what is \"proper\" and what is \"harmful.\" How could I forget that the authorities are omniscient gods!\n I don't recall making that claim. In fact, I think I that I specially stated:\nWhat might count against the morality of the 'War on Drugs' is the ham-fisted methodology that it uses to produce more harm than good, but not its intentions.\n So rather than claim that the \"authorities are omniscient\" I actually noted that authority is fallible by refering to the crude methodology of the 'War on Drugs', which is a program enacted under the authority of the Government of the United States. \n \n Interestingly the problems that the 'War on Drugs' cause are the result of the US gov't failing to recognize the important distinction between the perception of harm and harm itself. In failing to make this distinction, the 'War on Drugs' conflates its perception of harm with harm itself and fails to subject that perception to adequate peer review. The result is a clumsy one-size-fits-all policy (much like moral relativism) that causes more harm than necessary in its application.\n \nThe fact is that the War on Drugs is a subjectivist crusade, nothing more.\n I disagree. As I have argued, it's a clumsy application of good will rather than any intrinsically wrong.\n \nPuritanical Nazis want to dictate to us what we can do with our bodies to the end of forcing us into living cookie-cutter lives. The War on Drugs reduces human life to the property of the State, preventing us from \"harming ourselves\" so we can be better tools for the ruling class. Where is the morality in that?\n Hmm. I think you may find it useful to read up on classical liberal conceptions of rights so that you understand how rights come into conflict in a liberal-democratic society, and how those conflicts are resolved. In a liberal society such as the USA, a choice is made about the primature of rights such that the interactions of those rights in human political concourse maximized the freedom of the individual citizen. The problem is that this maximizes the freedom of those citizens whose interests match up most advantageously against their freedoms. But they argue that it's the only way to maximize the overall freedom of everyone.\n \n Bringing this back to the Prisoner's Dilemma, and this is exactly what the liberal project proposes, the only way to maximize the overall freedom of everyone is to accept some limitations to their freedoms. The use of force to enforce those rights legitimized by a system of moral reciprocity where citizens agree to live by the same set of rules. \n \n Which is why I think you're un-necessarily demonizing those people who support the 'War on Drugs'. I tried to point this out using the old metaphor that the road to Hell is paved with good intentions. The point of that metaphor is that all reasonable people work from good intentions. Those intentions have to compete with greed, and may be at the mercy of an inadequate patience for careful thought, but when they're channelled into such a massive and well-organized law-projects they have to be expressions of moral conviction. These people enact laws from moral conviction. Accusing these people of being evil just reinforces their conviction. And the more they're convinced of their moral high ground, the harder it is to convince them they're wrong. \n \n Genuine malevolence is rare, and since alienating people through misunderstanding is counter-productive, you really should give people the benefit of the doubt when assessing intentions because intentions are so hard to judge. It's certainly more productive, and definitely more anarchistic to work from principles of good will under proven otherwise.",

The phrase \"In a free society\", though I can't remember where exactly it comes from, refers to a society in which conflicts are resolved through property rights rather than violent intervention.\n Exactly, by all parties compromising with laws instead of resorting to violence freedom is maximized for each individual by guaranteeing a minimum set of rights. By making rights a necessary, but not sufficient, condition on freedom, people who can expand their freedom so long as it is not brought into conflict with the rights of others.\n \nYou've already said though, that you don't believe you can add or subtract utility between people, so where does that leave you in deciding which is worse?\n Ah, this brings me to a moral scheme I'm going to present to the Dalhousie Colloquium on July 8th: the economics of ethics. The idea is to treat people's interests as being balanced against each other to produce a hierarchy of interests. This way the good can be considered as a scarce resource to be bought with valuable interests. What exactly is better or worse may be cashed out differently in different cultures, but there are absolute limits set by economic models such that certain interests must necessarily have a low value and other interests must necessarily have a high value. Such an Economist's Dilemma couches morality in a language sensitive to both context and limits - a full moral vocabulary of good/bad, better/worse, reciprocity, and motivation. \n \n Instead of deciding which state of the world is worse by judging comparative aggregate utility scores, we decide which state of the world and method of achieving it best satisfies all of our interests. If you want to know what is right or wrong in a moral economy, you have to know what costs you're willing to incur for what benefits. Some costs will always outweigh the benefits, and are absolutely wrong. Some benefits will always outweigh the costs, and are absolutely right. Some costs and benefits will be context dependent such that they will either be valued either higher or lower, better or worse. \n \n Now, I'm worried that you'll interpret this as simply being a sophisticated form of utilitarianism. The economic model does provide formal limits by which such values are determined and quantified. Unlike the utilitarian theory however, the number of the interests catered to, the distribution, and the manner in which the distribution occurs, the cost of distribution, are as important as the aggregate total value. Thus the economics of ethics provides a framework that accomodates both case sensitivity and universality.",

   "And isn't culture in a constant state of flux - and in this sense constantly being \"harmed\"?\n Culture is certainly something fluid, I agree. Think of the healthy development of culture as being like velocity - where the culture changes naturally at a constant rate of change. Where that rate of change itself changes, like acceleration, is the 'change' that I'm talking about. A culture in which change is changing, accelerating or decelerating, is a culture being harmed. \n \n Think of these two kinds of changes as frictionless change and frictional change, with the latter being what I mean when I say 'change harms a culture' and the former being just a part of culture-qua-object. The cultural discontinuities of frictional change affects people's ability to use their culture to interact with other members of that community in a non-confrontational way. When changes in culture accelerate, people cannot use culture as effectively as a social medium. Imagine using a hammer whose shape and balance were rapidly changing, and you can see how a tool, social or otherwise, can be harmed by change. \n \nAgain, supposing the \"racist culture\" example, would not the change be a period where people become less alienated from each other?\n I think we need to distinguish between alienation between communities of people and alienation within communities of people. Alienation within the community is a by-product of this change of change, and the alienation between communities is business as usual. \n \n Supposing steady changes in a racist culture were leading to less alienation from people of neighboring cultures, a cultural convergence, then that would seem to be good and not harmful. But suppose that such changes began to accelerate, so that people used to a steady rate of change couldn't keep up, then internal alienation increases. This increase in internal alienation blunts and subverts those decreases in external alienation.\n \nDoesn't Kim Jong-Il gets more \"freedom\" by resorting to violence?\nYes, and he does so at the expense of other members of his community. \n \nIt seems to me unlikely any particular world-state will best satisfy all of our interests. You are then left with weighing one person's interests against another, are you not? The system may not be utilitarian, but it does appear as a sophisticated consequentialist model.\n I think it was Rawls that pointed out any ethical system that didn't account for consequences was 'insane'. What the system I propose does is allow interests to be weighed against each other, using an economic model, by ranking them according to the number of other interests they are compatible with. Some interests everyone obviously shares, some interests no-one has or wants, and some interests and their distribution varies amongst people depending on their context. \n \n I'm deliberately avoiding any discussion of the value of such interests, except as they relate to one another and facilitate one another, because I agree that a strictly consequentialist theory fails when confronted by uncertainty. The way that the market model processes information is a way of hedging against uncertainty and catering to the intuition that consequences matter. Likewise the formal limits of such a model cater to the intuition that our moral responsibility has certain limits and boundaries. These limits are the pure 'deontological' components of the theory and are formally decided.This means that we can know what is wrong, what is right, and have a method for resolving moral conflicts and dealing with moral risks.",

   "I don't think that's a useful way to think of a culture being harmed. If we are talking about a given culture being harmed, it is harmed precisely to the extent that it is changed. A slower rate of change means less harm to that particular brand of culture.\nThe point I'm trying to make is that culture-qua-tool develops and changes, and the pace of that development affects the efficacy of a culture as a facilitator of social interaction. \n \n If you're going to take a sample-slice out of an ongoing process of cultural development and fetishize it, as some people do, then you're probably going to regard any deviation from that static sample as harmful because that it supposedly represents an ideal state of culture.\n \n \nBut whether culture overall, rather than a particular historical instance of culture, is being harmed, has no basis apart from individual value judgements - some see the new wave of culture as better than the old, some worse.\n I think that the problem here is that you're interpreting me as claiming that harming a culture necessarily harms the individuals who use that culture. I'm arguing that interfering with a culture's usefulness as a tool for social interaction constitutes harm to it. Similarly interfering with a knife's usefulness as a tool for cutting harms that knife in the sense that I am using 'harm'. Sorry for the misunderstanding. \n \n Certainly some people see new developments in culture as benefitting or costing them, but the harm to the culture-qua-culture is something apart from culture-qua-community and individual people's interests. Some people may prefer a blunter knife (for chopping corn-cobs, for example), or even a broken knife. Melting down a knife for its steel 'harms' the knife, although it may benefit the new owner to use the steel for some other application. \n \n Harm to a culture is not necessarily harm to the individuals whose culture is being harmed. When a community's culture is harmed by an increasing or decreasing rate of development in that culture, it becomes less effective as a tool for social interaction and stimulates individuals alienation from each other and their community, as well as failing to ameliorate confrontation as well.\n \n For some people this may be an opportunity and for others it may be a crisis. But the fact that culture is being harmed is pretty objective because the institutions of that culture break down.\n \nNot neccessarily. The existing culture could be a \"culture of alienation within the community\", the change in culture being a decrease in alienation within the community.\n I think I'd reject the notion of a \"culture of alienation\" as a culture-qua-culture and interpret it as culture-qua-community. That is to say a \"culture of alienation\" would just be a community in the throws of rapid cultural change. When that change slows back down then alienation would decrease as culture becomes more stable and more user-friendly.\n \nThat's what I'm saying though, there isn't a single world state which maximises \"freedom\" for all of us as individuals, and its meaningless to try and maximise \"freedom\" for all of us as a group. I also disagree with the definiton of freedom you use, under which someone who is allowed to enslave others is regarded as being more free than someone who isn't, but I understand where you are coming from, from some previous posts you have made.\n Oh, I'm sure that there is a world-state, and indeed a set of world-states in which the total amount and equal distribution of freedom is 'maximized'. More to the point, I'm trying to point out that a person that cannot be owned as a slave is more free than a person that can be owned as a slave. I'm defining freedom as an individual's ability to satisfy their interests. While an individual may have an interest in owning slaves, that interest is secondary to the interest of all other individuals not to be slaves. Freedom may be in relation to the interests of the agent, but those interests are valued in relation to all other interests and their possible satisfaction. \n \nYou may be able to develop a system that most people are reasonably content with (like our democracies now, really), but I don't believe it possible to find any non-arbitrary basis for weightings of interests between people, based on any criteria.\n Indeed, and that's exactly the reason that I argue we should use a market model when dealing with ethics. In the absence of any non-arbitrary basis for weighting interests, I think we should bite the bullet like the mathematicians did and devise formal axiomatic systems whose worth is decided by how they handle ethical propositions. \n \nRawls would say something like that, it's very much in tune with his philosophy, but I disagree completely. An ethical system cannot account for consequences, since no particular set of consequences is in any objective sense better than any other, and any set of consequences aimed for an aesthetic or practical, rather than ethical, judgement.\n Depends on how you treat the formal relations and the content of that ethical system I think. Universal formal relations and limits don't automatically priviledge any set of consequences (content) to which they pertain, that is true. What priviledges these consequences are how they relate to one another in that system. The system is what provides the objective grounds upon which specific consequences may be valued. Different system, different values. The system merely needs to handle a sufficiently complete universe of ethical discourse.\n \nI never willingly gave up a right to shoot morphine into my eye. Government tries to manufacture consent, through statements like \"we oppose drugs\" and acting as if it is the people, so that when it bans something, the people have chosen to give it up, or when it kills Jews, they have really committed suicide.\n True, but then since representative government is supposed to do that for you then it all works out then eh? Far be it from me to argue in favour of representative government. The point is that by remaining a citizen of a country, you're implicitly consenting to their laws, and if you don't like those laws then there are legal opportunities for you to encourage your government to change them. Of course, you probably can't change them, but that's what you get for assenting to representative government. \n \n But yeah, I agree with you that drug laws weaken a community. But then a community that can allow the implementation of drug laws through acts of government on behalf of the people already has some pretty serious weaknesses to begin with - if people won't take responsibility for their own governance, how can we expect them to responsibly use drugs?*\n \n *Some drugs are responsibly used by avoiding them at all costs, I'd like to point out. Not because a nice man from the government told you so, but because you're aware of the effects of their use and are smart enough to infer from those effects that they harm you and your interests.",

   "I was interested in natural law, despite it being a hokey old ethical system where people are apparently arbitrarily declared to possess \"rights\", it being self-evident, or handed down from God, the system seemed to me intuitively just, and eminently practical, with consequentially desirable results for the great majority of people living under it, despite it being entirely non-consequentialist.\n A old-fashioned deontologist eh? Pretty interesting. The funny thing is that I was reading an awful lot of Kant, axiomatized set theory, and market economics (your fault, by the by ;)) when I came up with the idea of determining the value of moral actions by the operation of a market of interests, according to which we might satisfy both utilitarian intuitions of better-worse and deontological intuitions of universal rights and wrongs. \n \nI am most interested at the moment in the variations of \"argumentation ethics\", a sort of Kantian system you might view as a sort of \"non-natural law\", an attempt to derive rights from the logical structure of communication. There are a number of variations. Funnily enough I came across them through reading Hoppe, who is also an economist, though of a different sort than you are likely to have read.\n Any attempt to derive content directly from a formal structure is doomed to fail - you should remember the logicist project in mathematics of Russell and Wittgenstein. I'd suggest you check out how axiomatic set theory deals with the derivation of value from formal concerns. Numbers, as it turns out, seem to be derived from complex relations between those propositions that are about formal rules.\n \n Speaking of which, you may be very interested in reading the following by Andy Clark: http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/philo/courses/concepts/magicwords.html \n \nThe general gist of it goes something like this;\n For something to be wrong, means for it to be punishable.\n Interesting supposition.\n \nSuppose someone commits a murder, and he turns himself in, or you catch him, and you can prove he committed the murder. And you ask him, \"Is murder wrong - is it justifiable for us to punish you for this?\"\n \n And he says \"Murder is wrong\", he has consented to punishment.\n \n If he says \"Murder is not wrong\", he has consented to being murdered.\n So you're trying to tie moral responsibility to people admitting to sharing a moral schema?\n \nSo murder is elevated to the status of a punishable offence, whether a defendant claims it to be punishable or not.\n I'm not sure how that follows. Could you explain that again?\n \nObviously the real thing's a lot more sophisticated than I've presented, and their are objections and counter-objections, but I think they're exploring a worthwhile path. With consequentialism IMO a futile endeavour, and motivation based ethical systems just terrible, it's the best shot I see.\n To what end? What exactly is it about ethics that you want these systems to do or explain?",

   " I'm not sure how that follows. Could you explain that again?\n\n \n Essentially, it puts \"criminal\" in the position of being unable to object to his punishment, because if he objects that murder should not be punished, he consents, himself, to being murdered without the murderer being punished, essentially opening himself to punishment via \"murder\". It's not so much forcing people to live by any one moral scheme, as forcing them to live consistently by their own moral scheme, and is, in this sense, highly pluralistic. (You could, for example, have a society of thieves - though for practical reasons, the existence of such a society would be unlikely to last long).\n \n \n To what end? What exactly is it about ethics that you want these systems to do or explain?\n\n \n The aim is to derive a system of \"just law\" independent of valuations, and to accurately sketch out the arena of social relations, such that any moral objection to the legal system is self-defeating.\n \n I haven't read much of Wittgenstein, Russell, or anything by Andy Clark, I'll get onto them after my exams perhaps.\n \n If you want to read economics, I highly recommend Human Action by Ludwig von Mises, and then Man, Economy and State by Murray N. Rothbard. They sketch out an alternative methodology in economics I believe to be superior to the orthodox approach. Human Action in particular is a great read as well for historical content - They're both available in pdf format on www.mises.org",

I think that we can say objective things about the rationality of actions, and that the rationality of actions is something objective that we can say objective things about. Can't say I buy into the whole axiological relativism bit, especially when it deals with rationality. What is objectively rational to do is to satisfy your own best interests. You may not know what your own best interests are, and you may be mistaken about them, but to satisfy them is rational. \n \n Although the miser may prefer hoarding money and believe that doing so satisfies his interests, he does so from some failure of rationality. This scenario is much like a heroin addict may prefer heroin and believe that shooting it satisfies his interests. These failures may be the result of undeveloped reasoning, ignorance of relevant values, or some mixture of the two. The fact that the miser has different preferences from me does not infer that values are relative, unless we're using some novel sort of inductive inference.

   "Okay, firstly, you are not able to say that hoarding money does not best satisfy the interests of a miser. Unlike a drug-addled heroin junky, it is entirely probable that a miser possesses a modicum of intelligence and sanity, and entirely plausible that the hoarding of money is as ultimately satisfying to him as a good meal, sex, knowledge, or any other factor are to any other person.\n \n \nWhat is objectively rational to do is to satisfy your own best interests.\n\n \n The alternative definition I propose, and what the economics I endorse holds, is that it is rational to act in such a way that you attempt to best satisfy your interests. \n \n So my second point is, even if the hoarding of money does not satisfy his interests, it is entirely rational of a miser to pursue the accumulation of wealth, so long as he believes that it will satisfy his interests.\n \n The heroin addict example may be misleading, because we have good Psychological evidence to believe that a junkie may not consciously decide to shoot up, it becomes a sort of reflexive action - the way a smoker might have reached into their pocket and lit up a cigarette before they even realised what they were doing. In this sense a junkie's actions may not be rational, because not only do they not satisfy their interests, they do not even act on the basis of the belief that they will, they do not \"act\" at all.\n \n I'll quote old Mises here, for his writings on the subject in Human Action; partly because I think he covers the subject well, partly because I enjoy his style of wring.\n \n \nHuman action is necessarily always rational. The term \"rational\n action\" is therefore pleonastic and must be rejected as such. When\n applied to the ultimate ends of action, the terms rational and irrational\n are inappropriate and meaningless. The ultimate end of\n action is always the satisfaction of some desires of the acting man...\n \n It is usual to call an action irrational if it aims, at the expense of\n \"material\" and tangible advantages, at the attainment of \"ideal\" or\n \"higher\" satisfactions. In this sense people say, for instance-sometimes\n with approval, sometimes with disapproval-that a man who\n sacrifices life, health, or wealth to the attainment of \"higher\" goodslike\n fidelity to his religious, philosophical, and political convictions\n or the freedom and flowering of his nation-is motivated by irrational\n considerations. However, the striving after these higher ends is neither\n more nor less rational or irrational than that after other human ends.\n It is a mistake to assume that the desire to procure the bare necessities\n of life and health is more rational, natural, or justified than the striving\n after other goods or amenities...\n \n An action unsuited to the end sought falls short of\n expectation. It is contrary to purpose, but it is rational, i.e., the\n outcome of a reasonable-although faulty-deliberation and an attempt-\n although an ineffectual atternpt-to attain a definite goal.\n \n The doctors who a hundred years ago employed certain methods\n for the treatment of cancer which our contemporary doctors reject\n were - from the point of view of present-day pathology - badly instructed\n and therefore inefficient. But they did not act irrationalIy;\n they did their best. It is probable that in a hundred years more doctors\n will have more efficient methods at hand for the treatment of this\n disease. They will be more efficient but not more rational than our\n physicians.\n \n The opposite of action is not irrational behavior, but a reactive response\n to stimuli on the part of the bodily organs and instincts which\n cannot be controlled by the volition of the person concerned.\n\n \n But indeed, even a heroin junkie, so long as he consciously chooses to engage in the partaking of heroin, can be said to be rational in his acting - even fully aware that in the long run, his actions will be harmful to him, still shooting up would simply indicate that he has a high time preference - and it is very much an arbitrary thing to declare a particular time preference more rational than another. Indeed, the junkie and the miser may represent the two extremes of time preference, one prefers satisfaction in the present at all costs, the other greater satisfaction later at the sacrifice of all satisfaction present. A normal distribution might be expected, but no particular grade of time preference any more rational than any other.",

So it doesn't make public policy, but it does act as a guide for the methods it should use to attain the ends sought. If the ruling party said \"I want to impoverish the people of this nation, and to do so we will use the methods of Kim Jong Il and his ancestors\", the only objection that could be laid, from an economic standpoint, would be that there are more efficient methods available of causing impoverishment.\n \n And yet what politician declares their desire to make people poorer? :p",

   "I did countenance for a while the possibility of objective values, partially due to Ayn Rand's stubbon insistence, although unsupported, that they existed and that she knew them.\n Purely on the strength of analogy to Wittgenstein's private language argument, I'd say that the only values that exist are public and objective. \n \nBut it's not what you're talking about at all. I certainly accept that people can take actions they think will satisfy them, for example, completing their collection of dolls - and then once their action is complete, discover they do not feel satisfied, or happy, at all, and that their actions have been misguided.\n So the error isn't with their perception but with their action?\n \nIn contrast, we have someone who hoards cash, and then feels satisfied, feels happy, and yet is informed that he is not actually happy, or actually satisfied, that he only possesses the feelings.\n Ah, there's a point of miscommunication. I'm not claiming that the miser merely perceives himself to be happy and is not actually happy. I'm saying that mere happiness is not sufficient for the miser's actual interests being satisfied. The satisfaction of a desire to be happy is, while understandable, not necessarily what is in your interest. \n \nCertainly there is a distinction here, because the first statement is of a meta-order, like \"I feel like I feel satisfied\", that suggests a degree of doubtfulness.\n Since the difference specified is between first and second orders, actuality and perception, it doesn't really work to say that the first order is subject to perception. The truth of such a proposition is quite apart from the perception of that truth. I suppose you might ask why I would suggest something like truth independent of perception, being that truth is a conceptual relation. I do so because conceptual relations are not perceptual relations. For example 2+2=4 is true insofar as there is a system of rules and symbols whose mechanical operation produces such a proposition however it is represented.\n \nI do not think there is any distinction between \"I am satisfied\" and \"I have the feeling of satisfaction\" at all any more than \"I am happy\" and \"I have the feeling of happiness\". Can a person feel sad but not actually be sad, or vice versa?\n Well, let's take a similar situation then involving the second person. There seems to be a distinction between \"You are satisfied\" and \"I have the feeling you are satisfied\" - the fact that you are satisfied is independent of the observer. \n \n Now, suppose it is not your feeling of satisfaction that is at issue, and the proposition that \"I am satisfied\" does not mean \"I feel satisfied\" and instead means \"My interests are satisfied\". Likewise \"I have the feeling my interests are satisfied\". \"My interests are satisfied\" when my interests are indeed satisfied, and \"I have the feeling my interests are satisfied\" when I indeed have the feeling that my interests are satisfied. \n \n To recap: I agree with you that perceptions and feelings are subjective and that the truth of any propositions about you having those perceptions and feelings depends on you actually having those perceptions and feelings. \n \n I disagree, however, that perceptions and feelings about interests are interests themselves. After all, I am not happy because my interests are satisfied, but I am happy because I think that my interests are satisfied. I may think wrongly about what my interests are and be happy when my actual interests are not satisfied. Likewise I may think wrongly about what my interests are and be unhappy when my actual interests are satisfied. But it cannot be the case that my perception is not my perception, my feelings are not my feelings, or my interests not my interests.\n \nThere's a big deal about economics, as a science, being meant to be wertfrei or value-free.\n Yeah, there is a big deal about science and other tools being supposedly value free. Even when we abstract the values underwriting whatever task we are using said tools for, how we use these tools, or how they are made and maintained, I suggest that we are left with something that is not value-neutral or value-free. If they were value-free, they'd be useless. Unless we want to bog down in circular definitions, some values just need to be assumed in order to go ahead and devise a tool. When people say something is \"value-free\" they usually just mean that its operation may be described by a universally applicable, or 'objective', set of values. \n \nThere is a for example, if someone says \"I wish to raise the living standard of the workers - I will increase the minimum wage to $20\", the analysis is built to answer the question \"Will raising the minimum wage raise the living standard of the workers?\". So it doesn't make public policy, but it does act as a guide for the methods it should use to attain the ends sought. If the ruling party said \"I want to impoverish the people of this nation, and to do so we will use the methods of Kim Jong Il and his ancestors\", the only objection that could be laid, from an economic standpoint, would be that there are more efficient methods available of causing impoverishment.\nYes, I agree that economics is a tool by which public policy is implemented, but it is also a tool by which public policy is evaluated and measured as well. Much like a stencil defines what may be drawn (printed?), a science of economics defines public policy by framing it in terms of that particular system of economics. If you imagine a system of economics to be like a language according to the framework that Andy Clark suggests in that paper I linked to a while back, then you can see how it mediates our approach to public policy. If you only have a hammer, screws won't be considered for your fastening needs, to abuse another analogy. \n \nAnd yet what politician declares their desire to make people poorer?\n Any politician that doesn't declare their desire to make people richer, I'd think. I would think that would be the silent rider to all those promises to improve security, get tough on crime, strengthen national unity, or whatever other area that the politician want to expand gov't influence in.",

   "Yes, but there is no difference between \"You are satisfied\" and \"You have the feeling of satisfaction\". Someone who is satisfied certainly has the feeling of satisfaction, but they may not feel they are satisfied.\nThat seems to be question-begging as I understand it. If what you're saying is that \"You are satisfied\" really means \"You have the feeling of satisfaction\", then it seems that \"You have the feeling of satisfaction\" really means \"You have the feeling that you feel satisfaction\". This proposition now seems to really mean: \"You have the feeling that you feel the feeling of satisfaction\". And so on. \n \n That's why I tried to suggest we phrase these propositions differently, so that they represent more accurately what I am trying to say. \n \n Instead of saying \"I am satisfied\" or some variation, it seems more accurate to say that \"My interests are satisfied.\" and \"I am feeling satisfied(1) that my interests are satisfied(3)\" to properly differentiate between the thing to which satisfaction in the first sense pertains and the perception to which satisfaction in the second sense pertains. \n \n It might be something to differentiate between the two of the uses of satisfaction to avoid amphiboly, eh?\n \n http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=satisfaction\n \n Specifically we appear to be dealing with #1 and #3, and #3 is poorly worded so that it seems to imply perception whereas I'm trying to stress a 'satisfaction' in terms of satisfying conditions. \n \nThe examples you are providing discuss feelings of a second order - feelings about whether or not you possess the first order feeling of satisfaction itself.\n They were intended to demonstrate that first order satisfaction is not a feeling in the #1 sense of 'satisfaction'. Let me try again: \n \n 1. Suppose that an abstracted set of interests are either satisfied or not according to some scheme of necessary and sufficient conditions such that each normative statement of interests is matched by a state of the world. \n \n 2. Suppose further that the state of the world must be interpreted or perceived such that each state of the world may be matched by a descriptive statement. \n \n 3. If the descriptive statement derived from perception of the world states appear to match the normative statements defining the interests, then we will feel satisfied by this turn of events because it appears that our interests are satisfied. \n \n 4. Therefore regardless of how we fail to satisfy our interests, we may feel satisfaction when our interests are not satisfied. \n \n \nThen why should anyone rational seek to satisfy their actual interests, if they are divorced from enjoyment?\n Because the satisfaction of those interests is more important than enjoyment/pleasure/happiness or lack thereof. Again, I think that the feeling of enjoyment/pleasure/happiness may be confused with more abstract utilitarian notions of intellectual enjoyment/pleasure/happiness.\n \nThey are erroneous in their expectation of what will satisfy their future self - as a result they take actions inappropriate to generating that satisfaction.\n So they err when they are mistaken about what will make them feel good in the future?",
