   "Grief is no time for knee-jerk reaction to gun laws\n \n \n \n Grief is no time for knee-jerk reaction to gun laws\n by Mark Moritz - Jan. 16, 2011 12:00 AM\n \n \n \n \n When I saw the picture of Christina-Taylor Green, that little 9-year-old angel, I broke down and cried. It was a time for tears, for grieving, not for name-calling and finger-pointing. \n \n \n \n Sometimes, people react strangely to grief. When my clients die, I counsel their relatives to forgive everything anybody says because they can say inappropriate, hurtful things. \"You killed Dad because you didn't visit him in the nursing home.\" \"You can have another child/get remarried.\"\n \n Let it pass. It's the grief talking; it's feeling instead of thinking. So, in the case of this atrocity near Tucson, people have blurted out irrational, inappropriate things. They blame Sarah Palin or the \"tea party\" or talk radio or Arizona and Arizonans, or supposedly inadequate gun laws.\n \n Take, for example, \"Constitutional Carry,\" Arizona's law that acknowledges a citizen's right to bear arms, openly or concealed, without government permission. That's supposed to prove we have a \"Wild West gun culture\" (just like Vermont, that other Wild West hotbed of violence).\n \n Does any rational person believe that if Arizona law prohibited concealed-arms-bearing, the gunman would have said, \"Oh, darn,\" and abandoned his plan? \n \n \n \n The truth is, Arizona is not awash in gun carriers (unfortunately). If it were, when the gunman started shooting, a dozen people would have shot back and stopped the massacre sooner.\n \n In fact, the only person there with a gun was the shooter, suspected of being Jared Loughner. There was one young man, Joseph Zamudio, carrying a concealed pistol, but (like the police) he was too far away and too late to stop the gunman earlier. \n \n \n \n So, what's the proposal? Pass a law criminalizing concealed-arms-bearing and mandate jail time for people like Zamudio? U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords herself is an advocate for Constitutional Carry.\n \n Loughner is accused of killing six and wounding 13, including Giffords. What if he had not been able to get a gun but instead had driven his car into the crowd? The casualties could have been much worse. Timothy McVeigh killed 168 and injured 450 using plant fertilizer. Julio Gonzalez killed 87 at the Happy Land Social Club in the Bronx, N.Y., with a plastic jug of gasoline and a match.\n \n Here's a surprise: Handguns are among the least deadly weapons that psychopaths can use. Laws often have unintended consequences. Please, let's not pass laws that push psychopaths toward more deadly weapons. \n \n \n \n As for the libel against Arizona and Arizonans, it is more evidence of feeling instead of thinking. When John Hinckley Jr. shot Ronald Reagan, did people cancel their trips to see the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.? When Mark David Chapman murdered John Lennon, did the city of New York get blamed? Did people think badly of Atlanta because of the \"Olympic Bomber,\" Eric Rudolph?\n \n Crazy people do horrific things, everywhere. How can anybody, especially a public official, blame a city or a state or the people who live there? \n \n \n \n Hinckley also shot Jim Brady. Brady's wife, Sarah, lobbied for a national background check, promising that it would prevent such things from happening again. Skeptics said no, it wouldn't; it would be a billion-dollar bureaucracy that would inconvenience decent people without inconveniencing lunatics like Hinckley.\n \n The skeptics were right. An admission of error, an apology and a quiet repeal of the Brady Law would be nice. But more likely we will hear, instead, \"We need even more of what didn't work last time, and let's reinstate the magazine-capacity limit that failed for 10 years, too.\" \n \n \n \n At a time like this, we should all come together in grief and forgive people for saying hurtful things and advocating counterproductive laws. It's just the grief talking. Unless it isn't the grief talking and instead is a case of never letting a crisis go to waste. \n \n \n \n If people were cynically exploiting the shooting of lovely people to defame political opponents or promote and raise funds for a political agenda, that would be unforgivable. \n \n \n \n Mark Moritz is an estate-planning attorney in Chandler and a graduate of the American Pistol Institute in Paulden.\n \n \n\n \n Shooting rampage victim arrested at town-hall meeting\n Agitated man tells local tea party founder, 'You're dead!'--KGUN-TV, Tucson\n http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=251621",

   "The only mistake the \"left\" has made is not telling you gun whackos to sit down and shut up a long time ago. That's about all you understand: shows of authority, not reason. As far as many of us are concerned, any self-designed \"moderate\" is another right-winger, undermining any effort to restore some semblance of sanity to national dialogue, by pretending this is about two uncivil sides to a debate, when it is only about one.\n \n For example (i.e. on telling you to sit down and shut up, for a change), they could have arrested you at the Town Hall meetings, when you couldn't wait your turns to speak, you were breaking the rules of the meeting and disturbing the peace, and you wouldn't let anyone else exercise their Constitutional First Amendment rights; John McCain could have apologized to the nation for recruiting and letting loose the scourge called Sarah Palin with her gun sightings on his professed colleagues in Washington, and when Gabrielle Giffords and 3 others on Palin's list had their offices vandalized within 24 hours along with gun threats swamping in. But no, not a one of you either can tell your own that they're disowned, or you will be politically finished off. As Frank Rich lucidly describes:\n \n \nLast week a conservative presidential candidate, Tim Pawlenty, timidly said it wouldn&#8217;t be his &#8220;style&#8221; to use Palin&#8217;s target map, but was savaged so viciously by his own camp that he immediately retreated. A senior Republican senator told Politico that he saw the Tucson bloodbath as a &#8220;cautionary tale&#8221; for his party, yet refused to be named.\n\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/16/opinion/16rich.html?src=twrhp\n \n The Republican Party is directed by a group of ignorant, uneducated, backwoods terrorists who are deeply insecure about their manhood and attempt to compensate for this lack through their guns and ammo. Sarah Palin's rhetoric is not only deliberately rift with appeals to violentce, but deliberately rift with subliminal phallic references meant to titillate and jack you off unconsciously as you reach for your *holsters*. To wit, from her Facebook page, even after Gabrielle Giffords was shot and all these people, including a Federal Judge (in Arizona of all places) hearing a multi-million dollar immigration case were killed:\n \n \"The crossfire is intense, so penetrate through enemy territory by bombing through the press, and use your strong weapons - your Big Guns - to drive to the hole. Shoot with accuracy; aim high and remember it takes blood, sweat and tears to win,\" \n \n http://www.truth-out.org/poor-poor-sarah66781\n \n Solutions? Don't look within the Republican Party, or the Democrats for that matter, busy undermining those who speak out against these lunatics, so that they can appear \"moderate,\" and thereby, furthering empowering the trashy Palinists who are shooting them. \n \n As Rich also discusses, most anyone with a modicum of thinking knows the nation needs tighter gun control regulations along with the expanded health care many of these gun nuts resist, so that they can receive the mental health treatment they are so obviously in want of. (Though Rich is a bit prone to the weaknesses I have described, as well.)\n \n As for this typically fascist-minded conversation about throwing me off, if it happens, I will be as flattered as someone arrested down south during a Civil Right March.",

And they're going to keep happening because government can't prohibit the mentally ill.\n \n \nDoesn't anyone want to know what made this guy do what he did?\n\n \n What made him do it?

They've caved so much to the right, they are the right. They've continued to support our disastrous foreign policy of endless wars, bloated military spending, torture, health care reform that is more about saving the health insurance companies, preserving a bigoted caste system in American medicine, and providing these lecherous CEOs with an endless pool of unwilling customers - rather than providing quality health care to all Americans. They're basically following the same policies as the Republicans on the development of jobs and employment, giving big tax breaks to the rich who just take the money and run, while America continues to sink. They bail out the bankers, not the People. Just like the Republicans. They plot behind closed doors against social security. Just like the Republicans. On the local level, they preserve the status quo, are deeply nativist and parochial minded, play games with constituents, while helping Republicans, instead, and block any real progressives from getting on to the ballots or moving up in politics to higher levels. Short of some smattering of communities which I give credit for their local activism, for the most part, Democrats like Republicans, are a dishonest lot. Their hypocrisy and wimpism, in the case of this thread, on gun nuts, is one of the reasons they are now confronted with such a surly and unattractive bunch. They didn't shut them up at the Town Hall meetings because the plain truth is that they're in bed with the health insurance industry and the Democrats themselves didn't want the real people of the United States to be heard or *too* powerful. They wanted the People to be shut up on health care. So they let Dick Armey move in, with the industry funded Tea Party, Nancy Pelosi herself let them scream Americans down, instead of having them arrested, and now she's out of her position in the House, and they have a lot of dead people in Arizona. Obama used Rahm E., too, to tell his own base to keep their mouths shut (and then sent him off so no one would blame the President for this policy - but it is, indeed, his policy - Emanuel was the administration's fall guy along with the Press Secretary who also told their supporters to be quiet). \n \n So frankly, while I see Palin's rhetoric as horrific and very responsible for contributing to an atmosphere in which these people were killed, in many ways, I see the Democrat's failures to reform as opening the door very wide to people like her. Whether intentional, naive, or just plain stupid. They, at the very least, should know better. Instead of telling them to shut up, they went in and told their supporters to, and when they weren't even breaking any rules. And the right, being quite the bunch of bastards they have always been, grinned widely and rubbed their hands together.\n \n Anyway, I have lost interest in this board. It goes to show what a *discussion* it is when not a one of you even knows my views on the Second Amendment but have been responding to those *views*, and whether or not we agree or disagree, out of your imaginations, instead.\n \n You're all in your own little world here.

But often, these people fit a profile. \n \n Loners\n Socially awkward\n Frequent contact with law enforcement\n Recognizable signs of mental illness\n Frequently have contact with mental health angencies\n Male\n Early teens to late 40's\n Often foreshadow events to family, friends, and coworkers\n Difficulty holding steady employment or history of disciplinary problems at work / school\n Recent forced termination of employment\n Often considered intelligent but poorly motivated students\n Suffer abuse, neglect, and unstable homelife during childhood\n History of suicidal ideation or attempt\n \n ...and the list goes on and on. I think you should be able to get the general idea. Look up just about any mass murderer from the last 60 years and start checking off the boxes. Often the signs are there well in advance...they simply get ignored or dismissed without another thought. Perhaps we need to start listening and watching? We will never stop all of them, but looking back at many of the mass murders that have taken place, it is easy to see that there were opportunities lost.",

   "How about his sexual harassment approach be grounds for his banning?\n\n \n Uh...or, this being a debate forum, you could cite one of the countless psychological analysis that have been done on this and show the following:\n \n 1. Use/ownership/support of firearms ownership does NOT tend to indicate sexual dysfunction or insecurity\n 2. Claiming that it DOES actually tends to indicate sexual insecurity by those laying the claim. \n \n If you think about it, it actually makes sense. Personally, I am perfectly comfortable with my sexuality, both form and function. It would honestly never occur to me to use a slight like that against somebody else because if somebody used it against me, it would not bother me at all. \n \n IF, on the other hand, I was somebody who worried about my \"manliness\" or the size and function of my male parts, I might consider that a potent bit of mud to sling. \n \n Obviously J Miro spends a lot of time thinking about that subject and obviously considers it a potent insult. That says a lot more about him that it does about the person he is talking to. \n \n Personally, I would suggest that at least the men in this forum should be a little understanding about it. How would you feel if you had to spend a good portion of your life worrying that girls are going to laugh at your junk and tell you \"its a GOOD size\" while they are still trying to catch their breath from giggling uncontrollably?? How would you feel if after you made love to your wife she went off to the bathroom with a toy to finish what you could not?

   "What a gun means to a civilized society \n \n \n \n I offer you another stellar example of a letter (written by a \n Marine), that places the proper perspective on what a gun means to a \n civilized society. Interesting take and one you don't hear much... \n \n \n \n \n Read this eloquent and profound letter and pay close attention to the\n \n last paragraph of the letter..... \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \"The Gun Is Civilization\" \n \n By Maj. L. Caudill USMC (Ret) \n \n Human beings only have two ways to deal with one another: reason and force. \n If you want me to do something for you, you have a choice of either \n convincing me via argument, or force me to do your bidding under\n \n threat of force. Every human interaction falls into one of those two\n \n categories, without exception. Reason or force, that's it. \n \n In a truly moral and civilized society, people exclusively interact through \n persuasion. Force has no place as a valid method of social interaction, and \n the only thing that removes force from the menu is the personal firearm, as \n paradoxical as it may sound to some. \n \n When I carry a gun, you cannot deal with me by force. You have to use \n reason and try to persuade me, because I have a way to negate your threat\n \n or employment of force. \n \n The gun is the only personal weapon that puts a 100-pound woman on\n \n equal footing with a 220-pound mugger, a 75-year old retiree on equal\n \n footing with a 19-year old gang banger, and a single guy on equal footing with a carload \n of drunk guys with baseball bats. The gun removes the disparity \n in physical strength, size, or numbers between a potential attacker and a defender. \n \n There are plenty of people who consider the gun as the source of bad\n \n force equations. These are the people who think that we'd be more civilized\n \n if all guns were removed from society, because a firearm makes it easier\n \n for a[armed] mugger to do his job. That, of course, is only true if the mugger's \n potential victims are mostly disarmed either by choice or by legislative fiat \n it has no validity when most of a mugger's potential marks are armed. \n \n \n \n \n People who argue for the banning of arms ask for automatic rule by the \n young, the strong, and the many, and that's the exact opposite of a \n civilized society. A mugger, even an armed one, can only make a successful \n living in a society where the state has granted him a force monopoly. \n \n Then there's the argument that the gun makes confrontations lethal\n \n that otherwise would only result in injury. This argument is fallacious in \n several ways. Without guns involved, confrontations are won by the \n physically superior party inflicting overwhelming injury on the loser.\n \n People who think that fists, bats, sticks, or stones don't constitute lethal \n force watch too much TV, where people take beatings and come out of it\n \n with a bloody lip at worst. The fact that the gun makes lethal force\n \n easier works solely in favor of the weaker defender, not the stronger\n \n attacker. If both are armed, the field is level. \n \n The gun is the only weapon that's as lethal in the hands of an octogenarian \n as it is in the hands of a weight lifter. It simply wouldn't work as well\n \n as a force equalizer if it wasn't both lethal and easily employable. \n \n When I carry a gun, I don't do so because I am looking for a fight,\n \n but because I'm looking to be left alone. The gun at my side means that I \n cannot be forced, only persuaded. I don't carry it because I'm afraid,\n \n but because it enables me to be unafraid. It doesn't limit the actions of\n \n those who would interact with me through reason, only the actions of those\n \n who would do so by force. It removes force from the equation... And\n \n that's why carrying a gun is a civilized act. \n \n \n \n By Maj. L.. Caudill USMC (Ret.)\n \n It is pleasing to G-d. Read Nehemia 4:14 where the command is clear.",

Personally, I am perfectly comfortable with my sexuality, both form and function. It would honestly never occur to me to use a slight like that against somebody else because if somebody used it against me, it would not bother me at all. \n \n IF, on the other hand, I was somebody who worried about my \"manliness\" or the size and function of my male parts, I might consider that a potent bit of mud to sling. \n \n Obviously J Miro spends a lot of time thinking about that subject and obviously considers it a potent insult. That says a lot more about him that it does about the person he is talking to. \n \n Personally, I would suggest that at least the men in this forum should be a little understanding about it. How would you feel if you had to spend a good portion of your life worrying that girls are going to laugh at your junk and tell you \"its a GOOD size\" while they are still trying to catch their breath from giggling uncontrollably?? How would you feel if after you made love to your wife she went off to the bathroom with a toy to finish what you could not? I think it would SUCK and I think that the men on this forum should recognize that anybody who spends THAT much time worrying about it and talking about it should probably be cut a little leeway.\n\n \n You know what you are right...Hear that Miro?next time somebody says\"who are you gonna satisfy with that?\"you just say myself.",

   "We are printed out. In the past we were always able to control although devaluate the dollar, no more.\n \n \n \nBEIJING-Chinese President Hu Jintao emphasized the need for cooperation with the U.S. in areas from new energy to space ahead of his visit to Washington this week, but he called the present U.S. dollar-dominated currency system a \"product of the past\" and highlighted moves to turn the yuan into a global currency.\n \n \"We both stand to gain from a sound China-U.S. relationship, and lose from confrontation,\" Hu said in written answers to questions from The Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post.\n \n Hu acknowledged \"some differences and sensitive issues between us,\" but his tone was generally compromising, and he avoided specific mention of some of the controversial issues that have dogged relations with the U.S. over the past year or so-including U.S. arms sales to Taiwan that led to a freeze in military relations between the world's sole superpower and its rising Asian rival.\n \n On the economic front, Hu played down one of the main U.S. arguments for why China should appreciate its currency-that it will help China tame inflation. That is likely to disappoint Washington, which accuses China of unfairly boosting its exports by undervaluing the yuan, making its products cheaper overseas. The topic is expected to be high on U.S. President Barack Obama's agenda when he meets Hu at the White House on Wednesday.\n \n Hu also offered a veiled criticism of efforts by the U.S. Federal Reserve to stimulate growth through huge bond purchases to keep down long-term interest rates, a strategy that China has loudly complained about in the past as fueling inflation in emerging economies, including its own. He said that U.S. monetary policy \"has a major impact on global liquidity and capital flows and therefore, the liquidity of the U.S. dollar should be kept at a reasonable and stable level.\"\n \n Hu's responses reflect a China that has grown more confident in recent years-especially in the wake of the global financial crisis, from which it emerged relatively unscathed.\n \n Hu reiterated China's belief that the crisis reflected \"the absence of regulation in financial innovation\" and the failure of international financial institutions \"to fully reflect the changing status of developing countries in the world economy and finance.\" He called for an international financial system that is more \"fair, just, inclusive and well-managed.\"\n (snip)",
