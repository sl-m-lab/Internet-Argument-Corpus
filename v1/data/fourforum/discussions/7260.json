   "Rawls could well be the last of the great baritones, something my ear has always preferred. It was the golden age which began with Bing Crosby. The musical paradigm has shifted to singers with more emphasis on raw emotion and less on timbre quality. \n \n Not a condemation, just an observation.",

   "As a musician of 23+ years experience, my eyes and ears have been able to discern high quality musicians and performers. Lou was certainly one of the best. BTW, a vocalist worth checking out is Philip Bailey, successor to Maurice White as frontman with the R&B group Earth, Wind, & Fire. During their heyday, Philip had a range that could rival many female singers. Unfortunately time and the added responsibilities of taking on more lead vocals have taken a toll on his voice.",
