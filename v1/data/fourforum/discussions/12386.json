   "I have a suggestion that would marry or combine two excellent web-forums in a way that would likely enhance and strengthen the participation of both.\n \n I am a member of the \"Politico\" political forums. \n \n If you have never visited, you should. And when you do visit, you will notice that the forums there are lacking the structure and many of the features that the forums here have.\n \n I just think it would benefit both sites to combine the two (Politico and this one) and then watch the membership and participation soar!\n \n --ChuzLIfe",
