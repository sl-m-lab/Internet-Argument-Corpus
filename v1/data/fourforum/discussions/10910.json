I'm all about a lean, mean govt. but I do think you've got to take the fight to the enemy.\n\n \n You have apparently not paid much attention to Pauls platform. Paul has not suggested that we just play defense, or that we do not take the fight to the enemy. He proposes that we do not make the enemy in the first place. \n \n Our current problem is not with muslims. It is not even with Islamic Fundamentalists. It is with Arab Islamic Fundamentalists. Islamic fundamentalists are not any harder to come by than christian fundamentalist. They are all over the world...a dime a dozen. So why is the arab variety such a problem? Becuase we (the US) are directly responsible for the death and oppression of millions of arabs over the last several decades. This is why the problem is not restricted to the islamic fundamentalists. The US is wildly unpopular in virtually all of the middle east. We have been for a very long time. Arabs and Persians both hate us. \n \n So, why the focus on the arab islamic fundamentalist specifically? Because thus far they are the ones who attacked us. What Americans have apparently failed to realize is that they do not hate us because they are fundamentalists, they hate us because we are responsible for the death and oppression of millions of thier people. A dare say that if the shoe was on the other foot, we would hate them as well. \n \n I will tell you a secret about military command. Every military officer on the planet who may someday have to send one of his men on a suicide mission pays attention to who prays every night, who carried a holy book (bible, etc..) who wears a crucifix, and who goes to church. Why? Because in order to ensure that the man you send on that suicide mission will actually carry it out, they have to believe in an afterlife. They have to be religous. If you try to send somebody who is not religous, who does not believe in an afterlife, on a suicide mission, there is a good chance that they will balk at the mission. The baptist in the unit figures he is going to see jesus, and the stronger he believes that, the more willing he is going to be to undertake the mission.\n \n THAT is why we keep seeing the islamic fundamentalists attacking us. If you are going to send somebody to fly an airlined into a builidng, that have gotta believe in god, and they have to believe STRONGLY because if their faith fails, there is a good chance they will pull up at the last minute. \n \n Pauls philosophy is pretty simple. HE believes that if we were to stop supporting tyrants and dictators in the ME, stop blowing people up, stop aiding rutless regimes, that people would not hate us, and he believes that you are MUCH more likely to be attacked by people who hate you than by people who do not. \n \n Sadly many, many americans and virtually all of our politicians have chosen to adopt the frankly nonsensical view that we have no culpability in the current situation and that attacking somebody who has been responsible for the murder and oppression of millions of your people is somehow unreasonable, or worse that the murder and oppression did not occur, or that our support of it was inconsequential. \n \n Sadly (or not, depending on your view) this attitude...this national dishonesty, will, if it is not changed, absolutly and without question lead to the destruction of the united states. If the war with AQ does not end, that is the only possible result. Sadly since the american people apparently have the collective intelligence of a lima bean, they have not caught onto some critical facts. The first is that this is not as much a military war as an economic one. Bin Laden has told us on several occasions that their goal is not the military conquest of the US, which is impossible, but rather the economic destruction of our nation. That is the only metric that actually matters in this war and frankly we are getting whipped. We have added trillions in debt in fighting the \"war on terror\" and every intelligence estimate we have gotten for the last 5 years has said the same thing \"AQ is getting stronger\". At the same time, our economy is starting to crumble. Our debt is absolutly out of control and our debt service costs are projected to be over half a trillion dollars per year by the end of this year, meaning that even if we never run another deficit by 2020 we will be spending over 2 trillion per year just on debt service (keep in mind that our entire federal budget this year is only 3 trillion).\n \n If AQ could get us to open another front in the war on terror similar in scope to that in Iraq (though the Iraq mess is not actually a front in the war on terror), our economy, and thus our nation, would almost certainly fail in less than half a decade.\n \n As things stand today, we have some SERIOUS problems and our spening in the last 8 years has pretty much destroyed any possibility that we will be able to deal with them in anything resembling a desirable manner. We have this little problem with Social Security. \n \n Last year we had the biggest SS surplus ever. Starting this year, the surplus will start to decling until 2017 when reciepts will not meet payment requirements. In theory, this should not be a problem because SS has a HUGE trust fund. In reality, that trust funds is composed entirely of treasury bonds, and we cannot actually afford to repay even a single one of them. Medicare is in exacly the same situation excpet worse...starting THIS YEAR medicare reciepts will not cover expenditures, requiring that we redeem some of the bonds in the trust fund.\n \n The problem here is pretty obvious. Look at this years budget. There is a projected deficit of $400 billion dollars. The SS surplus this year is projected to be about $200 billion, and that surplus is converted into special issue bonds and added to the general fund, but, for some reason, even though they are issuing bonds...borrowing the money...they do not count it as part of the deficit, so in reality our projected deficit for this year is $600 billion if you use a defintion for the word \"deficit\" that is not complete and utter BS.\n \n So, every year from here on out, that SS surplus....that free money, shrinks until 2017 when it is gone completely. Then not only will we be $200 billion short when it comes to the budget, we will actually have to come up with extra money to redeem those trust fund bonds.\n \n Do you see the problem here? It simply cannot be done at this point. 8 years ago, before Bush and Co doubled our operating debt in fighting the \"war on terror\", we had some wiggle room and options. Now we have none. It has been made VERY clear by the financial world that making changes to SS specifically to avoid paying those bonds will be viewed as a default on those bonds, meaning that our treasury bonds will trade as JUNK. \n \n Basically what it boils down to is that by unducing that complete and utter XXXXX in the whitehouse, and the equally guilty XXXXXX in congress to spend away our last chance to try to do something about these problems, AQ has already destroyed us. They have delivered a fatal shot to the head, we just have not figured it out yet. \n \n And all brought to you by the stupidty and delusion of the American public. Paul is right...it is just too late to really do anything.",

   "\n Our current problem is not with muslims. It is not even with Islamic Fundamentalists. It is with Arab Islamic Fundamentalists. Islamic fundamentalists are not any harder to come by than christian fundamentalist. They are all over the world...a dime a dozen. So why is the arab variety such a problem? Becuase we (the US) are directly responsible for the death and oppression of millions of arabs over the last several decades. This is why the problem is not restricted to the islamic fundamentalists. The US is wildly unpopular in virtually all of the middle east. We have been for a very long time. Arabs and Persians both hate us.\n\n Invalid assesment.\n My alternative take based also on historical fact is that Arabs have their own version of 'White Man's burden' and are the culture responsible for the spread of Islam. \n For every 'Arab or Persian' you point to who hates us, I'll show 10 who love us. It is the small, disenfranchised minority who not only oppose us but their own governments who are causing the hoopla. Much like it is in any other culture or nation. \n These radicals aren't appointed by the people but, like evangelicals, assume a mantle of leadership on their own. Interpreting their religious texts in such a way as to be combatative. Often, in from your own commentary, successfully pretending to be a victim.\n \n The US is scapegoated for all the worlds woes.\n And, yes, our policy is sometimes responsible. But, more often than not, that doesn't hold true.\n Other nations, that are equally to blame for the problems in the M.E. are largely left alone. Why?\n My take would be because they aren't the big dog any longer.\n When you're the 'head' you get the attention.\n This is witnessed in politics where the leader is blamed for anything, including the weather and natural occurances.\n \n \n \n \nI will tell you a secret about military command. Every military officer on the planet who may someday have to send one of his men on a suicide mission pays attention to who prays every night, who carried a holy book (bible, etc..) who wears a crucifix, and who goes to church. Why? Because in order to ensure that the man you send on that suicide mission will actually carry it out, they have to believe in an afterlife. They have to be religous. If you try to send somebody who is not religous, who does not believe in an afterlife, on a suicide mission, there is a good chance that they will balk at the mission. The baptist in the unit figures he is going to see jesus, and the stronger he believes that, the more willing he is going to be to undertake the mission.\n\n That is incorrect.\n Many who have committed suicide missions haven't believed in an after life.\n The common denominator is a strongly held conviction in something.\n Religion is just one example of this conviction.\n Revenge could be one.\n Ideology (such as wishing to be a hero for the Communist people) is one. \n Wanting to protect your family, friends and way of life is another.\n Ingrained cultural expectations is another. This is indemic brain washing.\n Bansai ***ch!\n \n Many of those who are recruited for such often lack self identifiers and replace that empty portion with something else. Youthful people who haven't had time to develop it.\n \n These types of people will ALWAYS exist. \n \n \nPauls philosophy is pretty simple. HE believes that if we were to stop supporting tyrants and dictators in the ME, stop blowing people up, stop aiding rutless regimes, that people would not hate us, and he believes that you are MUCH more likely to be attacked by people who hate you than by people who do not.\n\n Realpolitic would say find a target for them to fight against that isn't you.\n Tyrants will always appear. Always have and will be here long after we're gone. You can either try to sit back and do nothing or try to direct them in a manner that serves your aims.\n Paul's a gimp.\n He may appeal to the idealist but, in the end, the cynic wins.\n The moment we realize this aspect of human nature, the better able we are to deal with it.\n The only alternative is to constantly wage war on all tyrants...but then the lines become more blurred on who's the tyrant and who isn't.\n We get to the level of 'one man's terrorist is another's freedom fighter.'\n \n \n \nSadly (or not, depending on your view) this attitude...this national dishonesty, will, if it is not changed, absolutly and without question lead to the destruction of the united states. If the war with AQ does not end, that is the only possible result.\n \n America and all other nations fall in time. \n \n \nSadly since the american people apparently have the collective intelligence of a lima bean, they have not caught onto some critical facts. The first is that this is not as much a military war as an economic one. Bin Laden has told us on several occasions that their goal is not the military conquest of the US, which is impossible, but rather the economic destruction of our nation.\n\n At the end of WWII, the Japanese emperor stated, in newsprint, that they could not win by military activities and would instead wage their (war) economically.\n If you were around in the 80's, that would have appeared to be a success.\n Now, with them as an ally and strong trading partner, we look to quality Japanese products to buy.\n If Osama thinks he can break us financially, he's mistaken. All he can do is cause us hardships. He's nothing more than a slave revolt in ancient Rome.\n \n And since many nations are tied to the US economy and those we fight in suffer massive damages, if the US goes down, we take everyone else to the same level as us (or close to it).\n \n I'd say the best OBL and those like him can do is to create conditions like they were in the 1920-30's that would allow demogogues to come to power and end up resulting in world wide wars.\n The US has a history of fighting such.\n And in such, we have a tendency to let the gloves drop off...and engage in American Bezerkerism.\n I don't think many fully grasp that we'd be willing to (and have) incinerate cities.\n We also have a decent propaganda machine that would justify such to ourselves. \n \n \n As is seen, terrorism works and if the US is pushed, could be a great exploiter of this practice.\n \n \n Gah...back to work.",

In four countries-Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Lebanon, and Jordan-large majorities of respondents (from 58 percent to 67 percent) explained their unfavorable attitudes toward the United States as being based on American policy in the Middle East. In the UAE and Egypt almost a majority-47 percent and 46 percent, respectively-based their attitudes on U.S. policy.\n\n \n \n \nThe US is scapegoated for all the worlds woes.\n And, yes, our policy is sometimes responsible.

Valuable trading partner? They suck money out of our economy and then block US products at the port. Beef in Japan sells for astronomical prices, but US beef will rot at the dock. They are not \"trading partners\" they are the seller, we are the buyer.\n \n Pop in over at http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?p=301571#post301571 and lets talk some numbers if you actually believe this. The truth of the matter is, even without further AQ intervention, we are in BIG BIG trouble due to the money we have already spent on this. Seriosuly, if you have some ideas follow the link above. Would love to hear how we are going to fund our government even in the near future, much less 20 years down the line. \n \n \nAnd since many nations are tied to the US economy and those we fight in suffer massive damages, if the US goes down, we take everyone else to the same level as us (or close to it).\n\n \n Incorrect. Other western nations would suffer pretty badly. If you look at india and the asian nations, including china, the worse the economy in the US gets, the better their numbers get. As economies falter, people start value shopping...start looking for lower cost alternatives and frankly india and asia are where those lower cost alternatives come from. You can even see this in US consumer data. Despite broad losses to retailers, Wal mart continues to see growth and their growth seems to be accelerating in the last month as middle class and upper middle class consumers start frequenting wally world in order to strtch their dollars. \n \n \nI'd say the best OBL and those like him can do is to create conditions like they were in the 1920-30's that would allow demogogues to come to power and end up resulting in world wide wars.\n The US has a history of fighting such.\n And in such, we have a tendency to let the gloves drop off...and engage in American Bezerkerism.\n I don't think many fully grasp that we'd be willing to (and have) incinerate cities.\n We also have a decent propaganda machine that would justify such to ourselves. \n\n \n We were willing to incinerate cities in Vietnam. We still lost. It this kind of war, incinerating cities does not do you any good at all and strengthens your enemies. OBL and those like him destroyed the soviet union. The soviets underestimated them. Not surprisingly, americans do not appear to be bright enough to lern from history.\n \n \nAs is seen, terrorism works and if the US is pushed, could be a great exploiter of this practice.\n\n \n Terrorism obviously does work. BL declared an economic war against the US, spent about $300,000 on a big attack. Since then we have blown through $5 trillion in borrowed money, much (if not most) of which is directly tied to our responses to that attack. At the same time we have commitments at home that we now cannot possibly afford to meet and ratings agencies are talking about downgrading our bonds, which would make it nearly impossible to continue funding the operation of our government. We shot our last load and wasted it.",

Beef in Japan sells for astronomical prices, but US beef will rot at the dock. They are not \"trading partners\" they are the seller, we are the buyer.\n\n They do buy our stuff. More so than they would before.\n And if they're sucking money from us (like China is too), blame it on greedy Americans XXXXXX who want cheaper import goods. \n \n \nPop in over at http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?p=301571#post301571 and lets talk some numbers if you actually believe this. The truth of the matter is, even without further AQ intervention, we are in BIG BIG trouble due to the money we have already spent on this. Seriosuly, if you have some ideas follow the link above. Would love to hear how we are going to fund our government even in the near future, much less 20 years down the line.\n\n I didn't say that we're not suffering, I said OBL's not to blame. We have a history of bad financing and big spending.\n It'll all come down sooner or later.\n My proposal would be a big F*** you all war. Primarily to ensure other nations are dropped to a lower rung than the US (or what ever is left of the US). Pretty much how a child will toss a game board when their cunning plans for victory are not working...yeah, a big immature child...with nuclear weapons going to rot. Makes you wonder why you ever paid for those game pieces if we aren't going to use some.\n \n \nIncorrect. Other western nations would suffer pretty badly. If you look at india and the asian nations, including china, the worse the economy in the US gets, the better their numbers get. As economies falter, people start value shopping...start looking for lower cost alternatives and frankly india and asia are where those lower cost alternatives come from. You can even see this in US consumer data. Despite broad losses to retailers, Wal mart continues to see growth and their growth seems to be accelerating in the last month as middle class and upper middle class consumers start frequenting wally world in order to strtch their dollars.\n\n At a certain point, that would drop off too. You can't buy anything if you have NO money. And those retailers have also experienced difficulties in recent months.\n China is also an importer of raw materials. \n And an investor into the US economy. \n They'd be on my F*** you list. \n \n \nWe were willing to incinerate cities in Vietnam. We still lost.\n\n Ummm...we didn't incinerate Vietnam. We launched some hald hearted attacks. Then got sick of it all and eventually had the masses dictate what would happen. You're mistaking some bombing runs for Dresden and Hiroshima.\n \n \nIt this kind of war, incinerating cities does not do you any good at all and strengthens your enemies. OBL and those like him destroyed the soviet union. The soviets underestimated them. Not surprisingly, americans do not appear to be bright enough to lern from history.\n\n Strengthen your enemy?\n OBL embarrased the Soviets. They didn't 'destroy them'. They had plenty of other problems. An analogy would be 'The Chechnyens are destroying the Russians'...oh, snap...they AREN'T.\n Geesh. You've been listening to mush heads or something. \n \n \nTerrorism obviously does work. BL declared an economic war against the US, spent about $300,000 on a big attack. Since then we have blown through $5 trillion in borrowed money, much (if not most) of which is directly tied to our responses to that attack. At the same time we have commitments at home that we now cannot possibly afford to meet and ratings agencies are talking about downgrading our bonds, which would make it nearly impossible to continue funding the operation of our government. We shot our last load and wasted it.\n\n When counting dollars...you might as well count heads killed too.\n As those are NOT the factors in determining a victor and you should know that.\n More so when compared to economic base or population size.\n Stats lie if you want them.\n \n \n The 2nd part of your statement has to do with victory...which side is 1st to blink or back down from their objectives.\n This 'war' is too half hearted.\n \n I don't think you can EVER win a war on terror. \n Terrorism is more often than not an individualistic choice. 10 men with AK's and a couple of truck bombs at some of the busiest malls during Christmas could cause quite a havok for less than 300,000. Less training too. But, less sensationalism. And like GLORY hounds, that's what AQ was going for. \n Copycats occur following some crimes also. \n \n It was just dumb to wage such a 'war'.\n As to Afghanistan, too little attention paid in achieving objectives there before going on to wage a 2nd front.\n Iraq, good idea (IMO), bad undertaking.\n \n \n \n So, while it may sound immature. I think tearing the system down and seeing what would happen would be a very interesting thing to see.\n But, knowing human nature, the scum would float to the top and we'd be in the same (or worse) situation than we all are in now.",

You're mistaking some bombing runs for Dresden and Hiroshima.\n \n\n \n Zardoz is absolutely correct here. Many think that one of the reasons Vietnam failed was the restraint from the politicians on the bombing and attacking of Cities and territory in N. Vietnam. The policy of trying to protect the South instead of conquering the North is what many point to as the cause of failure...emoticon_xkill \n \n One thing about Hiroshima. Estimates of over 1 million Japanese dead and 500K US dead if there was a land assault of Japan, so it could be argued that the A bomb actually SAVED lives...emoticon_xkill",

   "I'm not going to go into detail on all those links, but look at the dates on most of them. The last 10 years has seen massive investment, doctors salaries have doubled in that time and their working conditions have improved. Yes, bugs resistant to anti-biotics are a problem but they are made worse by the privatisation of NHS cleaning. The cleaners used to be employed by the NHS and worked to clinical priorities. Now they're contracted out and work to those contracts. Blame Thatcher for that.\n \n Recent surveys suggest that the overwhelming majority of people are happy with the service they receive from the NHS. Digging up surveys from 20 years ago when Thatcher slagged of the NHS and cut funding at every opportunity gives nothing like an accurate view of the current situation. When Labour came to power spending on the NHS was less than 7% of GDP, it has increased massively since then, largely going to repair the damage caused by decades of underfunding.\n \n As for massive increases in taxation with public healthcare, yes I'm sure there would be. So what? There would be no need for employers of private individuals to buy health insurance which would more than outweigh the additional taxation given the efficiency of state run compared to private hospitals.",

Also, to compare efficiency you'd have to compare tax rates and total tax that was spent on health care. It doesn't matter so much as how much total GDP is spent. The cost comparison to deliver comparable services is what will show efficiency!\n \n One other important reason could be the ANYBODY with money that wants good care comes for Canada and the UK to the USA for treatment. I've never heard of anyone saying \"I've got to go to the UK and get treatment because the hospitals in the US stink!\" But I've met and heard of plenty from (esp.) Canada and the UK. That could be why.\n \n \n \n There was just a big story about Medicare in 3 counties in South Florida being ripped off for like 1.6 Billion. That's just one instance in 3 tiny counties!",
