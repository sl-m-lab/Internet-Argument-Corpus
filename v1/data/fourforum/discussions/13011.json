   "Admin, would it be possible to allow the author's of a thread to add polls to the end of their thread for the purpose of conducting a survey of sorts about the thread?\n \n In the absense of moderators, I think this would be very usefull in some debates especially in the challengers corner after a debate/ thread is locked. (or just prior.) That way, the readers themselves could be invited to vote on who they think won the debate.\n \n I realize this would be far from a perfect solution to the absense of moderators. But it give be some indication of how the debate was perceived. Wouldn't it?\n \n --Chuz",
