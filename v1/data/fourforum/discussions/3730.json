   "I wonder if this will survive Supreme Court scrutiny.\n \n By Martha Raffaele\n The Associated Press\n Updated: 2:52 p.m. ET Nov. 12, 2004\n \n DOVER, Pa. - When talk at the high school here turns to evolution, biology teachers have to make time for Charles Darwin as well as his detractors.\n \n With a vote last month, the school board in rural south-central Pennsylvania community is believed to have become the first in the nation to mandate the teaching of &#8220;intelligent design,&#8221; which holds that the universe is so complex that it must have been created by an unspecified higher power.\n \n Critics call the change in the ninth-grade biology curriculum a veiled attempt to require public schoolchildren to learn creationism, a biblical-based view that credits the origin of species to God. Schools typically teach evolution, the theory that Earth is billions of years old and that life forms developed over millions of years.\n \n The state American Civil Liberties Union chapter is reviewing the Dover Area School District case. Its Georgia counterpart, meanwhile, is fighting a suburban Atlanta district&#8217;s decision to include a warning sticker in biology textbooks that says evolution is &#8220;a theory, not a fact.&#8221;\n \n &#8220;What Dover has done goes much further than what&#8217;s happened in Georgia,&#8221; said Witold Walczak, legal director of the Pennsylvania ACLU. &#8220;As far as we can tell, Dover is the first school district that has actually mandated intelligent design.&#8221;\n \n From farmland to suburbs\n \n The district enrolls about 2,800 students. It encompasses the small, rural community of Dover borough, about 20 miles south of Harrisburg, and a patchwork of farmland and newer suburban developments in several surrounding townships.\n \n The revision was spearheaded by school board member William Buckingham, who heads the board&#8217;s curriculum committee.\n \n &#8220;I think it&#8217;s a downright fraud to perpetrate on the students of this district, to portray one theory over and over,&#8221; said Buckingham. &#8220;What we wanted was a balanced presentation.&#8221;\n \n Buckingham wanted the board to adopt an intelligent-design textbook, &#8220;Of Pandas and People: The Central Question of Biological Origins,&#8221; as a supplement to the traditional biology book, but no vote was ever taken. A few weeks before the new science curriculum was approved, 50 copies were anonymously donated to the high school.\n \n Although Buckingham describes himself as a born-again Christian and believes in creationism, &#8220;This is not an attempt to impose my views on anyone else,&#8221; he said.\n \n Dissenters resign\n \n Two of the dissenting board members, Carol Brown and her husband, Jeff, were so upset that they resigned after the 6-3 vote on Oct. 18.\n \n &#8220;We have a vocal group within the community who feel very strongly in an evangelical Christian way that there is no separation of church and state,&#8221; Carol Brown said. &#8220;Our responsibility to is to represent the viewpoints of all members of the community.&#8221;\n \n Statewide science-curriculum standards approved by Pennsylvania&#8217;s state Education Board merely ask students to &#8220;analyze data ... that are relevant to the theory of evolution.&#8221;\n \n When the standards were revised three years ago, the board considered language that would have required students to consider evidence that did not support evolution, but the board dropped the idea after critics alleged it would have led to the widespread teaching of creationism in public schools.\n \n Creationism repackaged?\n \n Critics of intelligent design contend it is creationism repackaged in more secular-sounding language.\n \n &#8220;Creationism in a cheap tuxedo,&#8221; said Nicholas Matzke, project information specialist for the National Center for Science Education in Oakland, Calif., which advocates for the teaching of evolution.\n \n Even the Seattle-based Discovery Institute, which supports scientists studying intelligent-design theory, opposes mandating it in schools because it is a relatively new concept, said John West, associate director of the institute&#8217;s Center for Science and Culture.\n \n &#8220;We&#8217;re completely against anyone who says you should downgrade or limit the teaching of evolution,&#8221; West said.\n \n Uncertainty in school\n \n Dover biology teacher Jennifer Miller said the curriculum changes have left her uncertain about how to approach her evolution lesson.\n \n &#8220;If you put the words &#8217;intelligent design&#8217; into my curriculum, then I have to teach it,&#8221; said Miller, a 12-year veteran. &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure what that means as to how in-depth we have to go. ... I&#8217;m looking for more direction from the school board.&#8221;\n \n Neither Assistant Superintendent Michael Baksa, who oversees the district&#8217;s curriculum, nor Superintendent Richard Nilsen responded to telephone calls and e-mail messages.\n \n Jonathan Tome, whose three sons attend Dover schools, applauded the measure.\n \n &#8220;You can&#8217;t be hypocritical with these kids, teaching them one thing but not another,&#8221; said Tome, 43.\n \n But sophomore Courtney Lawton said she didn&#8217;t have a problem learning only about evolution in biology class last year.\n \n &#8220;I just think they should keep it the way it is, and they shouldn&#8217;t add anything about a higher power,&#8221; said Lawton, 15. &#8220;People who believe differently, they might feel like they&#8217;re being segregated.&#8221;\n \n \u00a9 2004 The Associated Press\n \n http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6470259/",

   "\"You can't be hypocritical with these kids, teaching them one thing but not another,\" said Tome, 43.\n\n Absolutely! We can't teach these kids that the earth is a sphere unless we also teach them that it is a circle and a square. We can't teach them that the earth orbits the sun with all of the other planets unless we also teach them that the sun, all of the planets and the entire universe orbit the earth.\n \n Of course, by the same logic we can't teach that Christ is the Savior without teaching that Muhammad is the final prophet of the one true God.\n \n Of course, Mach is correct. Jonathan Tome is a doofus. And I'll bet that Jonathan Tome claims to uphold the Constitution of his country. And yet, he sees no problem with imposing his religion on all of the children in his town, after all, he is in the majority and the majority rules no matter what the Constitution says.\n \n Does anyone even suspect that Jonathan Tome would support the teaching of Buddhism to his children? How about Shintoism? But isn't it hypocritical to teach these kids one thing but not another?",

Then i dont see the problem in teaching something else of the same nature (not being factual), and allowing the people that is being taught the freedom to think for themselves and drawing their own conclusions.\n\n The problem is that science should be taught in science class. My bet is that you don't advocate that alchemy be taught in chemistry class, or astrology in classes of astronomy, or witchcraft in physics. In fact, I'll bet you don't even advocate that your religion be taught in any of the above classes. So why on earth do you advocate the teaching of a religious viewpoint in a class of biology.\n \n And of course, there is the matter of your bait and switch argument. First you claim that evolutionary theory is taught as fact. When assured that it is taught as scientific theory that is always open to the discovery of new data, you somehow arrive at the description of \"not factual.\" We see speciation happening and that supports what Darwin's theory said. And Darwin only had his pigeons to work with and the specimen collections from the voyage of the Beagle to realize that selective pressures on populations can change that population.\n \n Since we have seen speciation and we see in the fossil record and in DNA analysis the various relationships of modern species, common descent is logical - the same DNA codons that encode the same amino acids that are combined into families of proteins across virtually all living organisms.\n \n But since scientific theory isn't factual, you think that religious superstitions should be brought into the classroom on an equal footing? You think that college educated biologists (99% reject young earth creationism) should teach the creationism? Good idea. Any good teacher can conform to the letter of the law and present the \"creationist, let them decide for themselves, it happened by magic 6000 years ago\" mythology and have the class think it was a stand up comedy routine. If it were not such a waste of time then I would be for it.\n \n But let me ask; why is it that you want your religion to be taught in public schools? Why can't you study your religion in your church and let the schools teach science? Why do you find it necessary to impose your religion on everyone's children?\n \n I'm not sure of where your are from, but in my country the Constitution forbids the government (federal, state, or local) to endorse or support religion. It also forbids the government from outlawing or burdening a person's pursuit of whatever religion he chooses. In my country, to present creationism as an alternative in a science class in a public school is to endorse not only religion, but a particular religious view. Until the Constitution is suspended, \"GODDIDIT\" isn't going to be presented as science.",

And Darwin only had his pigeons to work with and the specimen collections from the voyage of the Beagle to realize that selective pressures on populations can change that population.\n \n Since we have seen speciation and we see in the fossil record and in DNA analysis the various relationships of modern species, common descent is logical - the same DNA codons that encode the same amino acids that are combined into families of proteins across virtually all living organisms.\n \n But since scientific theory isn't factual, you think that religious superstitions should be brought into the classroom on an equal footing? You think that college educated biologists (99% reject young earth creationism) should teach the creationism? Good idea. Any good teacher can conform to the letter of the law and present the \"creationist, let them decide for themselves, it happened by magic 6000 years ago\" mythology and have the class think it was a stand up comedy routine. If it were not such a waste of time then I would be for it.\n \n But let me ask; why is it that you want your religion to be taught in public schools? Why can't you study your religion in your church and let the schools teach science? Why do you find it necessary to impose your religion on everyone's children?\n \n I'm not sure of where your are from, but in my country the Constitution forbids the government (federal, state, or local) to endorse or support religion. It also forbids the government from outlawing or burdening a person's pursuit of whatever religion he chooses. In my country, to present creationism as an alternative in a science class in a public school is to endorse not only religion, but a particular religious view. Until the Constitution is suspended, \"GODDIDIT\" isn't going to be presented as science.\n\n This religous superstition on creation, i believe to be fact. And the whole deal here is the origins of man. \n \n If the bible is fair dinkum, then there should be physical evidence that backs it up. \n So this is where we require the science, to find the evidence then enterperate that evidence to support the stories in the bible..\n \n In the same way that evolution is not being imposed on kids?, I do believe that people should have the freedom to look at the physical evidence of the bible that science has helped to recover and translate then draw their own conclusions of the origins of man.\n ps Im Aussie",

   "This religous superstition on creation, i believe to be fact.\n\n But why should your religion be taught in schools? Why don't you study your religion in your church and leave the teaching of current scientific theory to the teachers of science. Why do you seem to want scientists to teach your religion? Do you think that it is a good idea? Will a Buddhist, a Wiccan, or an atheist actually teach your religion?\n \nAnd the whole deal here is the origins of man.\n\n Right. Descended from a common ancestor with chimps. But the whole deal isn't the origin of man but whether the mythology of nomadic, bronze age herdsmen is \"factual.\" And it isn't.\n \nIf the bible is fair dinkum, then there should be physical evidence that backs it up.\n\n Then the problem is solved. There is no evidence to support the Biblical version of creation (6000 years ago) or a global flood (4500 years ago). Genesis was first debunked by Christian scientists who realized that the geology of the Paris basin could not possibly indicate a global flood.\n \nSo this is where we require the science, to find the evidence then enterperate that evidence to support the stories in the bible..\n\n That's not science. Science does not start from the colclusions. And even though I've never heard of a word like \"enterperate\", and can't find it in my dictionary, I suspect you mean that you will twist the evidence to support your stories. Well put! That is exactly my understanding of \"creation science.\"\n \nIn the same way that evolution are not being imposed on kids?,\n\n In the same way that physics is being imposed on kids? In the same way that chemistry is being imposed on kids? In the same way that geology is being imposed on kids? Why shouldn't science be taught in a science class?\n \nI do believe that people should have the freedom to look at the physical evidence of the bible that science has helped to recover and translate then draw their own conclusions of the origins of man.\n\n I have no objection. But I don't think that your superstitious mythology should be presented as science. Actually, there is no physical evidence of the mythology of Genesis. Some of the Bible is history, and some is bloated history, and some is poetry, and some is mythology. None of it is science. But why should your Bible be presented as fact in a class of chemistry, physics, or geology? Oh!!?? What is it?? You only want to present your religion in biology classes? why not present your religion in classes in your church.\n \n If you want to impose your religion on every student in the school system, then isn't it fair that evolutionary theory should be presented in your church?\n \nps Im Aussie\n\n And? I've got many mates from OZ. Paul Willis, of ABC, is an internet mate. Too bad you don't seem to have paid attention to any of his programs. I find that it is actually necessary that one tries to learn before he can become educated.\n \n If you want some more references from OZ, I'll ask. I moderate a Australian board (from the US) but I'm not sure where everyone is from. Some are from Europe, many from the U.S. and many from OZ.\n \n I'm not sure of the point.",

   "Your sweet Waxy, theres no offence taken. Its just that i have difficuilty to string the rite words to explain what i mean at times.\n \n I guess what im trieing to say is, if we are not teaching evolution on the grander scale as being as factual as you know it to be on the minimal scale (speciation). Then i dont see the problem in teaching something else of the same nature (not being factual), and allowing the people that is being taught the freedom to think for themselves and drawing their own conclusions.\n\n \n Pandion has laid this out for you in very clear terms.\n \n Creation is religious based, plain and simple. Any resemblence it has to actual science is strictly coincidence or intentional deception.\n \n Do you think that all religion's creation stories should be presented in science classes?\n \n Every student is free to seek out the \"evidence\" for creation through their church and draw their own conclusions. It is not the school system's job to educate students on a particular religion, it is their job to educate them on the SCIENCE.\n \n Waxy\n \n PS I'm glad you at least had the common sense to back off on your other claims.",

   "- Storm boy, honestly. If you were presented with indisputable evidence that your religous beleifs were wrong (speaking purely hypothetically at the moment) would you change your view point? Ask yourself this question honestly, could you live without God? Or at least could you live with the Bible not being 100% true? Surely if your faith is true then it should really stand up to every piece of evidence thrown up against it, not just as a combined whole but the seperate theories as well. If you have to ignore evidence and ideas presented to you rather than being able to argue your case then you don't really have faith at all - you are just holding one persons word against another. Unless you think that God has intentionally set out to trick people so they can not enter heaven you can not ignore the evidence that contradicts the human written Bible without addressing it and showing what errors they have made",
