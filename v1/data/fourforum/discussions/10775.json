   "Abusing Children in the Name of God\n By Shawn F. Peters\n \n A hemophilic boy in Pennsylvania bleeds to death over a period of two days from a small cut on his foot. An Indiana girl dies after a malignant tumor sprouts from her skull and grows so enormous that it's nearly the size of her head. A boy in Massachusetts succumbs to a bowel obstruction. (His cries of pain are so loud that neighbors are forced to shut their windows to block out the sound.)\n \n None of these children benefit from the readily-available medical treatments that might save their lives, or at least mitigate their suffering. Because the tenets of their parents' religious faiths mandate it, their ailments are treated by prayer rather than medical science. The results are tragic.\n \n It is difficult to determine precisely how many children in the United States lose their lives every year as the result of the phenomenon that has come to be known as religion-based medical neglect. A landmark study published in the journal Pediatrics uncovered more than 150 reported fatalities over a 10-year period - a tally that one of the study's authors later said represented only \"the tip of the iceberg\" of a surprisingly pervasive problem. Assessing whether forms of religion-related child abuse pose a greater risk to children than more widely publicized threats, such as ritual satanic abuse, a wide-ranging study funded by the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect concluded that \"there are more children actually being abused in the name of God than in the name of Satan.\"\n \n Since the late nineteenth century, hundreds of such instances of abuse have resulted in tangled criminal litigation. The parents charged in these cases - many of them Christian Scientists or members of small Christian churches that ground their doctrines in narrowly literal interpretations of the Bible - often have argued that the First Amendment safeguards their decision to adhere to their faiths' religious traditions and treat their ailing children solely by spiritual means. Prosecutors, meanwhile, have balked at the notion that constitutional protections for religious liberty provide an absolute bar to state regulation of religious conduct, particularly when that behavior puts the safety of children at risk. Their task often has been complicated, however, by murky state manslaughter and abuse statutes that appear to provide exemptions for religious healing practices.\n \n Arguing that they were \"Christians first, citizens afterward,\" a prominent Christian spiritual healer once urged his followers to disregard secular laws that might compel them to forsake their religious beliefs regarding healing. Such is the dilemma that confronts parents who choose to treat their sick or injured children with prayer instead of medicine. Not only must they safeguard the health of their sons and daughters; they also must try to reconcile their devotion to God with their duties as citizens in a society that boasts a long and sometimes checkered history of regulating uncommon religious conduct.\n \n Defining these obligations through the enforcement of secular laws - especially ones that are constitutionally fuzzy - can be a complicated business. Moreover, there is no guarantee that it will deter devout and stubborn parents from engaging in religious practices that endanger the health of their children. But the alternative - simply ignoring the suffering of the youngest and most vulnerable members of our nation's churches - seems unconscionable.\n \n Shawn Francis Peters' latest book, \"When Prayer Fails: Faith Healing, Children, and the Law,\" was published in October by Oxford University Press. He teaches at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n \n Posted by Shawn F. Peters on January 2, 2008 1:58 PM \n \n\n \n This helps prove my point from a post on the old site.\n \n I have always had a pension for science from an early age. I've always liked science shows. I owned my first microscope and chemistry set at 7 years of age and my first telescope at 9. I was never pushed, I was born with the question \"Why?\" rooted deep within me. I was also born christian. I attended bible schools, church and did private study of the Bible and Christianity for many years. But when I started to apply my scientific mind to Christianity and the Bible I found flaw after flaw and came to the conclusions that if the Bible is the true and actual word of God... either... 1. God is an idiot 2. The people he got to write the books are XXXXXX. 3. The people who wrote the Bible never spoke to God directly. 4. Man gathered the books and put the Bible together. And since man is flawed the Bible from the start must be flawed.\n \n So how does this play into creationism? Religion takes faith. Faith is question-less. Indiscretions and problematic ideas within faith are to be glossed over or ignored. Even Revelations in the Bible is the least read book among Christians for that it portrays God and Christ as angry, vengeful and war-like up even through Judgement Day when you are judged and are either saved or condemned. Even those who think themselves \"Born Again\" may end up doomed for all time.\n \n This shows the two faced view when applied the evolution. Because evolution does have gaps that can not be explained at this time by science, it is considered completely and totally wrong. Yet, medicine is incomplete and lacks many answers, but if a Christian is injured or sick they run to a doctor or hospital not a church. Why is this?\n \n Evolution and medicine are both rooted in biology, genetics, physiology, anthropology and chemistry, and use many of the same scientific techniques to progress and improve. Creationist use \"Intelligent Design\" as an alternative science to evolution science. So why do they not use an idea like \"Intelligent Designed Medicine\". I think it's due to the idea that they have \"no faith\" in an idea like that. If you had a family member that died on the operating table and the doctor claimed the death was due to the fact that you didn't pray hard enough... would you find that explanation expectable? What if the doctor said we will open you up but God will remove the disease and close you up. How well would that fly? Not well I would imagine.\n \n You see it takes 8-10 years to become a doctor and at least an additional 4-6 to specialize. But to be a creationist you can literally go \"POOF!\", and you are a creationist. POOF... that sounds familiar. Intelligent Design proponent love to through that one around. \"There's a pool of ooze that gets struck by lightening and then POOF, life!\". There is no such thing as POOF, POW, BAM or any other sound effect that demonstrations an instantaneous reaction.",
