   "\"The charges of communism made from a religious, a philosophical and generally, from a ideological standpoint are not deserving a serious examination.\" - Karl Marx\n \n The fact of the matter is that the gay movement cares nothing about the sanctity of marriage or the traditions that accompany them. Strike that, actually they do. However, not in the ways that you might suspect.\n \n During a time when Joseph McCarthy was questioning communists before the House Un-American Activities Committee, another radical movement was growing out of the same ideological fodder that fueled the Bolsheviks in Russia to commit massive democide, and participate in an orchestrated campaign to terrorize the general population. An oppressive terrorist state larger and more destructive than Nazi Germany emerged as a result. Fearing the same fate as Czarist Russia a conservative movement was born in the United States to defend our nation against the anarchy that ensued after the rise of the Reds. Unfortunately, they missed a less popular offshoot of Marxist ideology. \n \n During the Second Red Scare a political movement known as the gay agenda was developed. The founder of the political organization known as Mattachine Society, Harry Hay, was a member of the Communist Party from 1933 to 1951. However, he was asked to leave because the Communist Party thought he drew unneeded attention to a party that was being hunted down for behavior disloyal to the United States. Even still, he was declared a lifelong friend of the party and retained his sympathies to Stalinist Russia. To further expand upon the radical nature of Harry Hay, he was a huge supporter of NAMBLA. Not only that but he virtually invented the very idea that gays have historically been oppressed in the United States, a notion that lacks a preponderance of evidence, yet seems to be widely accepted by a population under attack by liberal elements. This supposed minority status has been the underpinning mantra used to advance the gay agenda.\n \n Is this relationship between the gay movement and communism a fluke? Is there significant evidence to suggest that today's movement remains tied to communist ideology? What about the links between the gay political interest groups associated with pedophilia?\n \n It is no coincidence that groups like Gay Liberation Front, and Earth Liberation Front were named \"in solidarity\" with the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, at a time the United States was at war with the Vietcong. The fact that the Gay Liberation Front has a version of its own Manifesto is testament to their Marxists leanings. This organization's mission is entirely consistent with communist teachings aimed at uprooting the status quo and eroding the institutions that conserve what is considered by them to be a oppressive system. Marx specifically targeted the institution of marriage and viewed families as an extension of capitalist hierarchy. By infiltrating and destroying every factor that generates a country's traditions, you could then reshape the future of that nation, write your own truth, and manipulate the perceptions of man. \n \n Marxism is the hallmark of the relativist perspective, and is the underlying reason why leftists refuse to make value judgments about anything except those organizations and institutions that do have clearly defined codes outlying ethical practices, hence communism's hatred for religious institutions.\n \n Traditionally religion has laid the framework for marriage and family. Thus, an excellent way to weaken the religious establishment is to attack some of the important traditions that have historically been associated with the church, thereby reducing the incentive for people to congregate towards those socializing organizations. However, this socialization must be replaced by something. To a Marxist there is no better alternative to religion than party affiliation, or a fanatical ideology. In effect, their plan is to destroy the largest competitor in the domain of the human perspective. For an ideology that ridicules monopolistic behavior, communists would like nothing more than to have unfettered access to all modes of influencing the political culture of an entire society. Which leads us to the link between the gay agenda and the public school system.\n \n It is no accident that the same Marxists who hide behind the label of homosexuality are not only attacking the institutions of marriage and the family, but they are infiltrating our school system in order to do this. The introduction of the Gay Liberation Front's manifesto states:\n \n \"We can use our righteous anger to uproot the present oppressive system with its decaying and constricting ideology, and how we, together with other oppressed groups, can start to form a new order, and a liberated lifestyle, from the alternatives which we offer.\" \n \n Obviously, this is an organization willing to employ the same violent methods of their Stalinist and Nazi predecessors. \n \n It is no coincidence that the Nazi Party had a active campaign to undermine the family through the educational system with programs like the Hitler Youth, and the gay movement has also sought to use the school system as a way of initializing social and political change. The difference here lies in the fact that socialists in the United States had to hide and develop less visible ways of engaging in active revolution, while the Soviets and the Nazis had already demonstrated their political power through wide-scale repression and terror campaigns. However, both movements understand the importance of an alliance with academia. Both movements use the schools as a component of their massive propaganda machines. Ultimately, the goal in both cases is to pervert minds and socially engineer the next generation of citizens with a dominating ideology. In the case of the gay agenda, it is being done to uproot modern capitalism, and destroy American values without the need for a violent revolution that would clearly fail, at this point. However, once our institutions, values, mores, and customs have been weathered significantly, an environment will persist allowing the violent extermination of political dissidents.\n \n We have already seen the beginning of the tyranny associated with such liberal movements being born of the gay agenda. Stalin used Trotskyism as justification for the forced removal of those who were hostile to his regime. Hitler conducted an operation known as the Night of the Long Knives to root out party members seen as security risks because they did not support his ideas, to gain the allegiance of the German Army, and to establish the supremacy of the S.S.. After Hitler gained absolute power he used it to further destroy church members, and other dissidents. Similarly, we have seen the creation of a term similar to Trotskyite, and laws that have the same chilling effect as Hitler's broad powers that allowed for him to silence his opposition. Anyone disagreeing with any aspect of the gay agenda is dubbed homophobic, and could face public humiliation. This is a particularly useful tool for a political interest group seeking political influence or possible power, as it reduces the overall criticism directed toward any of their proposals. In a sense, people fear the label, and avoid engaging in the kind of objective analysis important when dealing with any political interest. Furthermore, in some areas they have actually legislated against free speech by defining certain religious passages and criticism of the movement, at large, as \"hate-speech\". \n \n This type of behavior goes against the principles and democratic ideals that gay interests claim to value. Discourse and ridicule ought to be the tools applied when deciding things in an open society. Legislating speech is the work of fascists, tyrants, and despots and should not be used by a group aiming to further the social landscape. All those seeking political influence should be scrutinized since the stakes remain very high. Thus, it is my belief that Marxists have found a rather useful mask that will allow for them to advance their cause, enabling them to silence their opposition by effectively labeling them bigots. \n \n I often question how many gay rights activists are actually gay, since most of the gay people I know adamantly disagree with the agenda being promoted by those who claim to represent them. This is not a problem exclusive to the \"gay rights movement\". It is also a problem for the black community and their supposed leadership, as it remains a problem not easily addressed by a democratic government where the power of interest groups is not easily checked. It remains particularly dangerous when that interest group strategically silences any and all opposition. That's the type of thing that dangerous one-party cadre systems are made out of.",

   "The dog-walkers of the world would have you believe that they want nothing more than to be able to walk their \"harmless\" canines twice a day in peace.\n \n But is that claim really true? It doesn't take much research to discover that Hitler himself owned a dog, which he named Blondi -- an obvious reference to the preferred hair color of his so-called master race. What's more, the dog was a pure-bred German shepherd, hardly surprising given Hitler's own preoccupation with keeping the German bloodline untainted.\n \n Is it any coincidence that almost 18% of dog owners are blonde-haired and blue-eyed? Or that nearly 60% of them opt for genetically tragic pure-breeds of some sort, rather than mutts -- which are proven to be more affectionate and live longer lives, since they don't inbreed? \n \n But the link doesn't end just with Germany. The dog-walkers' leftist fascist agenda includes all of the Axis powers. Curiously, when you rearrange the letters in SPCA, you get \"spac,\" which is Italian for \"Die, you American capitalist swine.\"\n \n Coincidence? Hardly.",
