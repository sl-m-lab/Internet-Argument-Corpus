   "\".... I kept coming across articles and blog posts indicating the disappointment and even betrayal gay Democrats feel at the President's failure to follow through on the campaign promises he made to our community. This morning, when I checked my e-mail, my in-box was inundated with missives from readers alerting me to other such posts and articles.\n \n After my mid-day workout when I returned home to surf the web and blog, I found more such pieces, with straight blogger Glenn Reynolds alone linking three four just today.\n \n While I certainly understand their frustration of gay Democrats, I almost feel like telling them, \"I told you so.\" (I guess I just did that.)\n \n Democratic politicians, with a few notable exceptions, have an uncanny habit of breaking the promises they make to gay people. Aware of the affluence of our community and the dedication of our activists, Democrats know that by appealing to our interests, they can increase both their campaign contributions and their grassroots efforts.\n \n Their enthusiasm for Democrats who say the right things, however, seems a little unmoored from reality. Then-President Bill Clinton backed down on his promise to repeal the ban on gays serving openly in the military as soon as he saw there was a political cost. He signed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in 1996 when he thought he might help him with evangelical voters. Obama sat in a church for twenty years where a racist pastor spewed anti-gay rhetoric and never once challenged him on his prejudiced attitude toward homosexuals.\n \n Now, some may say, \"Well, Dan, you support the GOP and Republicans are no better, perhaps even worse.\" And I'll reply, \"Yep, you've got a point, my party's not perfect, but at least my guys don't treat our community like a cash cow, milking it when they need funds and hiding it in the barn when they fear it might offend the neighbors.\" it's not just that.

   "Don't Ask, Don't Tell...\n \n Part of the problem is that the public (and many gays) seem unaware that the president cannot simply revoke the law that excludes gays from serving in the military.\n Before the 1992 election, Clinton ran for office saying he would remove the barrier from gays in military service.\n Shortly after taking office, in response to this push, Congress pushed through an addition to the UCMJ codifying that gays cannot serve in the military.\n Congress passed it with a veto-proof majority. Clinton signed it. I suspect because he had no choice.\n Clinton then did the only thing he had left. Established a lower \"priority\" for the gay exclusion law which was essentially labelled (inaccurately) as \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\".\n The farce being is that there is NOTHING in the law that says the military can't pursue. Nothing in the law that says the military can't kick people out even if they don't tell.\n \n Fast forward to Obama.\n He has a CONGRESSIONALLY PASSED LAW.\n He can't simply snap his fingers and do away with it. He will need congress's support to revoke the existing law.\n At best (on his own) what Obama COULD do is issue a \"pardon\" for each and every gay soldier. Essentially, \"ignoring\" the law.\n I think that is not only a dangerous precedent, but an incredibly bad move politically. Some people felt satiated because of the false image of DADT.\n Obama acting in that way would also create a false image, implying satiation when the truth is that if Obama were to lose the election, his successor could simply revoke the previous executive policy and we would be right back to where we started... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Obama needs to go through Congress.\n And I, for one, think Obama has more pressing issues at the moment...\n \n \n \nI assume he would certainly move forward on repealing DADT, given a recent poll showing that even conservatives favor repeal.\n\n This is a pretty naive way of looking at things.\n There is a HUGE difference between \"conservatives favoring repeal\", which I agree is the truth...\n ... and republican politicians favoring repeal.\n \n Take the last election as an example. Can anybody name ONE Republican presidential nominee who was in favor of ending the ban on gays in the military???\n One huge problem with the Republican party is that the party politicians DO NOT LISTEN to the majority of their party.\n They cater to the RELIGIOUS ZEALOTS in the party...\n \n Hate crimes legislation was on the floor of Congress. A MAJORITY of Republicans want sexual orientation hate crimes legislation protection.\n But that didn't stop the Republican POLITICIANS from being incredibly insulting towards gays on the floor of Congress, trying to parallel gays with child molesters and bestiophiles.\n \n If the Republican politicians would vote in accordance with the majority of Republican voters, Obama wouldn't have as much of a problem...\n \n \n \nHe signed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in 1996 when he thought he might help him with evangelical voters.\n\n Clinton HAS ALWAYS been in favor of preventing gay marriage.\n Him passing DOMA was simply him acting consistently with how he HAD ALWAYS believed.\n \n \n \nObama sat in a church for twenty years where a racist pastor spewed anti-gay rhetoric and never once challenged him on his prejudiced attitude toward homosexuals.\n\n emoticon_rolleyes\n Yeah.\n I'm sure conservatives WOULD HAVE LOVED to see Obama stand up in the middle of church and grab a mic and say \"that's not right...\"\n \n The truth is that Obama HAS BROUGHT UP GAYS to black pastors on numerous occasions. I honestly don't know if Rev Wright was or was not present on the variety of occasions he has done this.\n \n \n In retrospect, Bush promised a DOMA amendment in his 2004 campaign.\n He did not push the issue until 2006. TWO YEARS later.\n Here we are SIX MONTHS after Obama takes office, and people are talking of \"broken promises\"??? emoticon_rolleyes\n I agree Obama needs some pushing on the issues. ENDA should be passed. Gay Hate Crimes legislation should be passed.\n He needs to push for repealing DOMA and gays in the military as well.\n \n There are frustrations I have with Obama on these issues, but at the same time this article is a virtual hyperbole of asking Obama to move the anti-gay mountain in the midst of an economic crisis. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n And without surprise, I can't help but note the nature of the person stirring the pot with this article...\n \n \n \nNow, some may say, &#8220;Well, Dan, you support the GOP and Republicans are no better, perhaps even worse.&#8221; And I&#8217;ll reply, &#8220;Yep, you&#8217;ve got a point, my party&#8217;s not perfect, but at least my guys don&#8217;t treat our community like a cash cow, milking it when they need funds and hiding it in the barn when they fear it might offend the neighbors.&#8221; it&#8217;s not just that. As a conservative, I don&#8217;t believe state action is the appropriate means to advance social acceptance of gay people.\"\n\n 1) Six months, amidst \"The Great Recession\"...\n Obama has gone into the lion's den of the black church community telling them that they should be for gay equality...\n And you think it's him treating gays \"like a cash cow\"??? emoticon_rolleyes\n \n High on hyperbole. Quick on demands.\n As a conservative, I wouldn't be surprised if \"Dan\" was not as demanding of Bush on even bigger issues. Like Bush starting to talk about he DID NOT CARE where bin Laden was???\n \n 2) \"state action is the appropriate means to advance social acceptance of gay people\"???\n What we have is social INTOLERANCE and INEQUALITY.\n I could give a damn about your \"acceptance\".\n The GOVERNMENT giving me equal rights is not \"acceptance\".\n The government signed Brittney Spears quickie Las Vegas wedding. Does anybody think that was about the government \"accepting\" the farce relationship???\n \n Tell me. When people fought to end interracial marriage bans, was that about \"advancing social acceptance\"??? No.\n When blacks fought to end discrimination against them, was that about \"advancing social acceptance\"??? Were you against THAT form of \"social acceptance\"??? I doubt it... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n What this is ultimately REALLY about is preventing people of prejudice from using the state as a means to advance social stigma and signs of disapproval.\n And THAT is not what our government is about...",

   "More from the author linked to earlier ...\n \n \"Before the gay issue fades away, I wanted to offer a thought on the President&#8217;s attitude toward people like us. It&#8217;s an idea that&#8217;s been kicking around in my head for some while, at least since I read his first book, Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance. Let me qualify my post by saying I don&#8217;t have any concrete proof for my notion, but when I was chatting with another blogger, Roger Simon*, earlier this month (before the recent spate of stories on gays) and heard him (without prompting from me) offer a nearly identical theory, I wondered (yet again) if there was some substance to this thought.\n \n My thought was that Obama is either indifferent to or slightly hostile toward gay people. On Thursday, I noted he &#8220;sat in a church for twenty years where a racist pastor spewed anti-gay rhetoric and never once challenged him on his prejudiced attitude toward homosexuals.&#8220; But, then again, he never challenged any of the hateful, paranoid or narrow-minded statements Reverend Wright made. It could just be his, to build on a comment of a prominent Democratic Congressman, an absence of political courage.\n \n It&#8217;s not just Reverend Wright. Early in his bid for the White House, the Democrat campaigned with anti-gay gospel singer Donnie McClurkin.\n \n And while Obama has had many enthusiastic gay supporters (and apologists), one wonders if they supported him not so much for his attitude toward gays, but because of what they projected onto him, due to his charisma, his presence and his left-wing politics. That combination does work wonders for certain zealous gay partisans.\n \n I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;m right on this one, but it is an impression I&#8217;ve had. And my conversation with that straight blogger showed that I was not alone.\n \n We may, in time, find evidence to prove me wrong or to confirm this notion.\n \n But, ponder this, with polls showing an overwhelming number of Americans supporting repeal of Don&#8217;t Ask/Don&#8217;t Tell (DADT), the ban on gays serving openly in the military and his party ostensibly favoring repeal comfortably controlling both houses of Congress, why has the President put this on the backburner? And why do certain prominent gay Democrats give him cover when he does so?\"GayPatriot Does Obama Care About the Gays?",
