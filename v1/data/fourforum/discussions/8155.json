   "This week has seen some considerable drama in the financial world:\n \n Yesterday, stock markets around the world dropped by as much as ten percent in India, 11% in Russia:\n \n  Carnage returns to world markets\n \n \nMarkets were also rattled by a warning by the International Monetary Fund that the US might need to continue raising rates. Rodrigo de Rato, its managing director, said: \"Some measures might be needed in the future, but that will depend very much on the data on the strength of the US economy.\"\n \n Experienced City analysts said the scale of the falls was a sign of distress in the market and yesterday's moves prompted policymakers to intervene to calm markets.\n \n \"Prices never move as rapidly as when people are feeling pain,\" said Stephen Lewis, the chief economist at Insinger de Beaufort, a City bank. \"The question is whether the distress is going to build up into a systemic threat.\n \n \"If I were a supervisor of these markets I would be on red alert - and indeed I think some are on red alert.\"\n\n \n \n Asian markets were jolted after the People's Bank of China (PBoC) said it would use a combination of \"monetary tools\" to slow growth in lending.\n \n This could include raising banks' required reserve ratio, which would be seen as a sign the authorities were determined to slow the country's economic boom.\n \n Binit Patel, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, said: \"The reaction of the Asian markets to the apparent hawkish comments by the PBoC and the over-reaction of global asset markets last week to US inflation indicate just how unsure the markets are about underlying trends.\n \n \"Equally it suggests that volatility in markets around each incoming data point is likely to remain high.\"\n\n \n Inflationary fears trigger steepest Dow Jones drop since 2003 \n \n \nThe big losses were largely attributable to fear of inflation.\n \n A consumer price index (CPI) report last Wednesday showed that prices for a broad range of goods and services rose by 0.6 per cent in April.\n \n Even more ominously, the 'core' CPI figure, which excludes food and energy costs, rose by 0.3 per cent, more than most analysts had been anticipating.\n \n To some observers, this suggested that the sharp rise in oil prices in recent months, which has already had a big impact at the petrol pumps, was beginning to affect other areas of the US economy.\n\n \n However today, stocks in the UK and US recovered dramatically:\n \n FTSE bounces to strongest daily gain since 2003\n \n SNAPSHOT-U.S. stocks rebound as commodities jump\n \n And while all this is going on, an enormous transatlantic merger of stock markets is being mooted:\n \n NYSE Group Aims to Buy European Exchange\n \n Euronext declares surprise entente cordiale with New York's Anglo-Saxon predators\n \n So just what is going on? Is this just an unusually violent jitter in the market with \"parallels to 1994\" as stated in one of the articles, or does the rising price of oil and inflationary dollar give one pause for thought, that this could be the beginning of the \"long awaited unwinding of the global imbalances\" to quote another article? \n \n And what of the merger? For someone like me with very limited macroeconomic understanding, it is easy to speculate but impossible to conclude anything; will this merger fortify both markets, creating a stronger defence against a potential global slump, or will we just see both markets experience each other's problems as well as their own if the US economy starts to unravel due to the decline of the dollar?",

IMO how high the US has to increase interest rates to sell debt and at what level that number \n stifles consumer spending is the only immediate issue. The housing market is already toast. We still have two years of current administration and that's plenty of time for them to completely ruin our credit with their elastic debt insanity. \n \n I don't see how a merger of equity markets would offer any strength. It'll cut operating costs, but equity stock values are subject to emotion, be it one or ten exchanges.",
