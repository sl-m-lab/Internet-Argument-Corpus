   "Snopes debunks religious right lies\n by John Aravosis (DC) \u00b7 7/03/2007 07:22:00 PM ET\n \n \n You have to be a mighty big liar to make your way on to the pages of Snopes, the Internet's biggest \"urban myth\"-buster Web site. But the religious right, which wouldn't know Jesus or the Bible from a fat juicy donation to the GOP, specializes in the kind of un-Christian whoppers that make Satan himself blush. These folks think that if it doesn't involve bashing someone or some thing they hate, then it's just not God's work. And we wonder why so many die and have died in the name of religion.\n \n This time, Snopes caught the American Family Association lying about the hate crimes bill.",

   "Web-link to Snopes article:\n http://www.snopes.com/politics/sexuality/hatecrime.asp\n \n I think the \"hate crimes\" propaganda the religious right puts out is one of the more blatantly obvious lies that they tell. It's amusing to get into discussions with some people who oppose hate crimes based on the propaganda.\n It's typically an event of chasing your tail.\n They make a blatantly inaccurate claim.\n You respond by pointing out what hate crime legislation ACTUALLY says, and what it means.\n They either obfuscate or ignore, but eventually drop that discussion...\n \n Then, the lather, rinse, repeat sets in.\n \n They REPEAT the same blatantly inaccurate claim.\n You respond by again quoting what hate crime legislation ACTUALLY says.\n Again, they obfuscate or ignore, and eventually drop the discussion.\n \n I've seen some that will actually learn something, but most just blindly repeat the lines they have been fed.\n I've even come across a couple who have QUOTED relevant parts of the hate crime legislation that they thought would prove their point, yet OTHER parts which EXPLICITLY discuss their claim are pointed out and they drop the subject.",

   "The unhinged anti-hate crimes bill crowd converges on DC next week\n by: pam\n Fri Jul 06, 2007 at 11:00:00 AM EDT\n \n A homo-hating wingnut extravaganza will be held on July 10 and 11 in DC, with a motley crew gathering for \"Operation: Preserve Freedom,\" where they will continue spouting the end-of-the-world-for-\"Christians\" panic that they will be muzzled if hate crimes legislation passes. The spittle, no doubt, will be flying.\n \n Repent America, along with members of the Philadelphia 11, Elijah Ministries, BOND, Minutemen United, Pass the Salt Ministries, America Asleep Know More, Restoring America, and Life and Liberty Ministries will conduct a press conference regarding Senate Bill S 1105 (the \"Hate Crimes\" legislation) at 10:00 AM. The press conference will be held at our nation's Capitol building, E Capitol St NE & 1st St NE Washington, DC 20001.\n \n This press conference will address the disturbing trend that seeks to criminalize Christianity in America. As it stands, the freedom of speech and religion of Bible-believing Christians are in jeopardy today. Left unchallenged, this dangerous development will erode America's experiment in liberty and lead to increased hostility towards followers of Christ.\n \n \"American values are under attack by al-Qaeda and radical Islamists. Instead of combating this issue, it seems some within our government are more interested in criminalizing American citizens. The so-called 'Hate Crimes' bill is an attempt to take away the rights of Christians to speak out and express their freedom of speech. This is unjust and Americans deserve better than this from their elected officials.\" --Rev. Jesse Lee Peterson, Founder and President of BOND. [Another black homobigot used by the white evangelical movement for cover.. ]\n \n The lies these people tell are outrageous. No matter how often their claims are publicly debunked, they continue spilling out this propaganda.\n \n Hate crimes legislation doesn't place a bullseye on constitutionally protected speech or worship. It's meant to target those who commit violent crimes against persons because of a class of people they belong to (or even perceived to belong to, for that matter). That truth would be too inconvenient and certainly not suitable for fundraising.\n \n Outlets like the above folks and the bleaters at the Traditional Values Coalition and the Family Research Council make sure to e-blast their supporters that they are at risk if the federal law is expanded to include sexual orientation and gender identity. What they are really saying is their coffers are at risk.\n \n What these bigots won't discuss is that the ACLU, which focuses on free speech rights, supports the hate crimes bill because it protects First Amendment rights of free speech and free association. See after the flip.\n \n \n http://www.pamshouseblend.com/showDiary.do;jsessionid=3FC0CFB84A9E398129CE68A487D59D92?diaryId=2221",

   "When one studies history, it is hard to ignore the process that targets people for persecution. For instance, how did Hitler convince Germany to cooperate with his \"Final Solution\" against the Jews? He managed it by marginalization by passing laws to deny them freedoms, by using the media to dehumanize them, and then by setting them up to become the scapegoat of Germany's selfloathing, hatred, and failure as a nation. As Christians, we are deeply concerned America is on her way to repeating this same tyrannical course.\n \n ...For years, radical leftwing groups have introduced and sought to establish \"Hate Crimes\" legislation to promote the homosexual agenda. Just recently, one of them passed the House, HR 1592. A similar bill is currently being considered in the Senate. The legislation is not about guaranteeing homosexuals and crossdressers public access to food, shelter, or employment, things already protected by law. These bills are intended to prevent Bible-believing people and pastors from preaching the Word of God. The intention is to censor freedom of speech and freedom of religion of American Christians. It is about threatening the Church. If Christians pronounce what the Scriptures teach concerning the sin and crime of homosexuality as well as the hope of redemption through Jesus Christ our Lord, they could find themselves in jail.\n \n ...Another unfortunate sign our system of government is being broken by the sodomite agenda is the recent legislative debacle in Massachusetts. First, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court circumvented the constitutional process. They arbitrarily imposed \"same sex marriage\" on the citizens of Massachusetts through a deplorable act of judicial activism. Next, the members of the liberal Massachusetts state legislature surrendered to the demands of the radical homosexual lobby and the armtwisting of Governor Deval Patrick (D). Together, they betrayed the citizens of Massachusetts and circumvented the democratic process by prohibiting them from voting on this crucial issue. :\n \n Just unbelievable. And look at the whining that ensues when RA talks about being held accountable for fomenting hate and violence against LGBT citizens:\n \n Another case in point is the Southern Poverty Law Center, headquartered in Montgomery, Alabama. Their stated goal is to monitor hate groups and extremist activity in the United States. In times past, they have been champions against racial discrimination. In recent days, however, their focus has dramatically changed. No longer do they seek to just prosecute the KKK. No! Their new enemy to prosecute is fundamental Christians. They send out reports to our civil government listing Christian groups who are actively engaged in our culture and label them as the new \"hate groups\" that promote \"extremist activities.\" \n \n Bring out the tiny violin...if the shoe fits...",
