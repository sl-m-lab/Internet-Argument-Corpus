Besides most girls who think there \"popular\" are really snobby and mean and I don't want to be like that!\n\n \n We are all different yes... but at my school most of the people there just put on an act. They want to be popular so they dress and act that way. They want to be a punk, they'll dress and act that way... etc. I don't believe in popularity either, BUT it's still there. Again I agree with you, I don't want to be like the popular people either, but they are there and always will be... there is nothing you can do to stop them. They are clones of eachother. The punks are clones of eachother, etc... you get what I'm saying? That's what I was tryin to say with the other post. I agree with you on many points, but I don't think uniforms would make any difference.... it would make it a lot easier in the morning too, you wouldn't spend forever looking for something to wear.",
