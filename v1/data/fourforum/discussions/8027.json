Anyone is capable of having sex with anyone else(if you could call \"gay sex\" \"sex\"). The difference between a homosexual marriage and a heterosexual marriage(besides the fact that animals were meant to be paired heterosexually) is that GAY COUPLES CANNOT PROCREATE.\n\n Okay.\n When are we going to start applying that rule to heterosexual couples who cannot procreate.\n Women past 60 are obviously past menopause. They can't procreate, so they can't marry, right?\n How about people who have been surgically sterilized. They are obviously not intending on procreating, so they shouldn't be allowed to marry either, right?\n \n You can't apply a standard JUST to one group, and NEVER to the other...\n Another example of when that happened was with Jim Crow laws and blacks who were prevented from voting because they couldn't read, but whites who couldn't read were allowed to vote without question...\n \n \n \nI think that most people will agree with me that the function(not purpose, but function. The actual purpose in life that is serves) of sex is to procreate.\n\n I would disagree, and I would disagree with the claim of \"most people\".\n The vast majority of sex occurs with the EXPRESS DESIRE that procreation not occur. In a lot of it, specific precautions are undertaken to ensure that procreation will not occur.\n \n So while procreation may be a purpose of sex...\n It may be a \"function\" for some people having sex...\n It is obviously not the sole one, nor is it a required one.\n \n \n \nWhy, then, does it make any sense to you that homosexuals should marry.\n\n Say whaaaa?\n Marriage doesn't revolve around sex...\n Or are you going to start requiring couples which don't have sex to not be married...\n \n \n \nI won't use against you the fact that marriage originated inside of religions, because people saw it as being united under the Supreme Being as one person rather than two.

   "Marriage began as a strictly civil institution. Religion didn't get into it until much later, and was sometimes openly hostile to the concept.\n \n Even in this country, well after the church decided to co-opt the institution: \n \nMassachusetts' founders insisted on civil unions, not as a reluctant compromise with the state, but as a direct outgrowth of their religious beliefs. Puritans were dissenters from the Church of England, which like the Catholic Church treated marriage as a sacrament. In England, the king was \"defender of the faith,\" bishops sat in the House of Lords, and the Church of England had legal authority over all religious matters, including marriage. Puritans strongly opposed this system. They wanted to adhere strictly to the Bible in shaping their forms of worship, but as they read it, the New Testament offered no precedent for bishops, ecclesiastical courts, and royal control over religion. What's more, they held that the Bible sanctioned only baptism and communion as sacraments, since these were the only sacraments that Jesus took part in himself. \n http://www.common-place.org/vol-04/no-03/talk/",

   "A further excerpt from that last link: \nMassachusetts history reminds us that what we commonly call marriage today was initially, and quite deliberately, constructed as a form of civil union. Although marriage was a fundamental aspect of these highly religious people's lives and the foundational element of their social order, its regulation was separate from the church. The Puritan founders understood marriage as a social institution that needed adjustment according to changing circumstances, and they left the state to do this important work.\n \n In every region of colonial North America, devout believers fought over how to define true religion, and where to draw the line between church and state. In some of the smaller and initially more homogeneous colonies like Massachusetts and Connecticut, religious uniformity was enforced by the state. But taken collectively, no single religion in colonial America ever had the power to decide for everyone, everywhere, what was sacred. As a practical matter, the traditional practice of state-enforced religious uniformity proved to be unworkable in the new American republic. It was this de facto diversity that the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution enshrined in federal law.\n \n Different religious communities have long maintained different standards governing who can marry, whether interfaith marriages are permissible, what the obligations of marriage entail, and when or if divorces can be granted. We should not forget that the English Reformation began in 1529 with a conflict between Henry VIII and Pope Clement VII over whether Henry's marriage to Catherine of Aragon could be annulled. Henry said yes, Clement said no, and in that dispute a new religious tradition, with new ways of defining the relationship between church and state, was born. The idea of legalized homosexual marriage is no doubt innovative. Some religious traditions reject it, while others support it. But the same was true of past adjustments to the legal definition of marriage, such as the recognition of interracial marriage. The traditions pioneered by Boston judges-a legacy that removed marriage from church control-have made these legal adjustments to social changes possible. A policy wherein all marriages are considered as civil unions would be consistent with America's strongest traditions regarding civil liberties, equal rights, the separation of church and state, and the freedom of religion. \n",

   "foundit66: i have several comments. . You had some interesting points. When you said that marriage does not revolve around sex, you must have overlooked the part where i stated the other most common reasons. I said exactly this: \"the most common reasons for marriage are love, sex, and preocreation. Anyone can love anyone. Anyone is capable of having sex with anyone else(if you could call \"gay sex\" \"sex\"). The difference between a homosexual marriage and a heterosexual marriage(besides the fact that animals were meant to be paired heterosexually) is that GAY COUPLES CANNOT PROCREATE\" at one point. this is my main argument. you also mentioned the laws that conscrened blacks not being able to vote because they couldnt read. At one point (though this may not be the point you were refering to) the law that one had to be able to read to vote applied to poor whites who were hurt by these laws as well. I tried to specify that i was not refering to teh reason that people have sex. Usually this is different than the actual life giving purpose of it. I don't want you to think that I am prejudice. I know gay people. They are my friends and I love them, but I don't think it is right for them to marry into a gay relationship. I am the last person who should be called prejudice. You, for example, probably thought, by my words, that I was a strict conservative, but technically, I am more liberal. When you talk about \"which religion\" i had mentioned that almost every ancient civilization had a form of heterosexual marriage, and many religions created marriage as a part of their religion. I have never heard that the church begged for married couples to have extra rights. Are you sure that the church was responsible for that? Even if so, I do think that gay couples should have equal benefits. I just don't think they should wed.\n \n Thelmoose: I don't think that sexual relations between people of the same sex can be considered \"sex\". Most dictionaries, if not completely vague, will state that sex is between male and female. That is what i meant by that. I never said that sex was a requirement of marriage, or the other way around. I said that it was one of the most common reasons that people marry. I liked your comments, but I fear you mistook many of my words, as most others did. I agree that religion varies. I don't see how I have an egocentric view. Can you explain that? Again, I hope that no one thinks I am prejudice. Those closest to me would never consider me as such. I do wish there was a way for gay couples to recieve the same benefits in government as married couples, but I don't believe in homosexual marriage.\n \n MrWriteLA: You have an interesting point. I didn't know that about religion. I suppose I am just ignorant, but the reason I posted this message was to learn and bend my views accordingly. The religous standpoint was not my strongest one. I tried not to depend too much on it because many people nowadays are not religous. Even with the fact you pointed out, I have an argument.\n \n Again Everyone: I am here, not only to express my opinions, but to gain knowledge and understanding. I am but a naive youth. I am uninformed so far, except by the views I have gained from family. I do not wish to become like so many who base their beliefs on their family members; for or against. Thank you for improving the knowledge I have gained so faremoticon_xangel .",

My reason for wanting to marry my partner of 26 years is strickly for a stronger guarantee on NOT having our wills ignored by our families (who actually are not hostile at all to us thankfully, but when 'free money' appears, even the nicest of people can be greedy and cruel). We have power of attorney for each other, we want each other to inherit the house that we purchased and paid off together, etc. I think most gay people would never want to get married in a church, we want a civil marriage. I appreciate your honesty/humility and your willingness to at least listen. I really cringed when you quoted that 'adam and eve, not adam and steve' though because I've heard that a million times used by fundamentalists (which you are not). I know it's a cute little saying to straight people, but it is very insulting to gay people. Thankfully you came across as a humble person so I was able to simply let it go and not let it upset me.

   "Because of my religion, I will always believe it is a sin. That is not just my opinion, that is part of my religion as stated in the Bible. I do, however, believe that gays should not be restricted by their government. I agree that they should be allowed to get married, but I will always believe it is a sin. The Bible tells of many other sins that are not against the laws of our country. This shouldn't be against it either. If gay and lesbian couples want to get married, that's their decision.\n\n \n The reason people often get upset when religion gets mentioned is that it's often in the context, either implicit or explicit, of \"I think it's a sin, therefore you shouldn't do it.\" You don't seem to be doing that, for which I applaud you. However, it is the most common tact that people take when they bring up religion in debates about homosexuality. So, good job on the, \"this is how I want to live my life, but I don't want to impose it on you\" philosophy, but be aware of how rare that view is. That's why people's knee jerk reaction is to be offend when religion is brought up in these debates; they've been trained by long experience.",

   "That makes sense. And it is pretty much the reason I chose not to base my argument on religion. I don't expect everyone to follow my own views, and I won't make them. I wouldn't want other people telling me that my religion is wrong. I'd want them to let me firgure that out myself. That way I wouldn't be offended. emoticon_xangel",

   "PLease do not take offense. I only believe what I believe because I know no better. I never said that marriage was solely based on sex. Older people, past teh years of procreation, obviously have different intentions. Give me one reason why one homosexual person would want to marry someone of their own sex. I am surely not saying that I see no reason. I just wish that you would tell me one.\n\n \n \n Why would you want to marry a person of the opposite sex?

   "foundit66: i have several comments. . You had some interesting points. When you said that marriage does not revolve around sex, you must have overlooked the part where i stated the other most common reasons. I said exactly this: \"the most common reasons for marriage are love, sex, and preocreation. Anyone can love anyone. Anyone is capable of having sex with anyone else(if you could call \"gay sex\" \"sex\").\n\n But you're missing one important fact.\n NONE of those \"reasons\" are required for marriage.\n Absolutely none of them. Any combination of man/woman can marry for whatever reason they want. Even if it's just drunken fun.\n \n \n \nThe difference between a homosexual marriage and a heterosexual marriage(besides the fact that animals were meant to be paired heterosexually) is that GAY COUPLES CANNOT PROCREATE\" at one point. this is my main argument.\n\n 1) Did you miss the fact that this is IRRELEVANT?\n It just doesn't matter.\n If it doesn't matter for straight couples, regardless of their reasons for joining, it can't matter for gay couples.\n \n 2) If animals \"were meant to be paired heterosexually\", then why do gay animals exist in such abundance across so many species?\n http://www.bidstrup.com/sodomy.htm\n \n \n \nyou also mentioned the laws that conscrened blacks not being able to vote because they couldnt read. At one point (though this may not be the point you were refering to) the law that one had to be able to read to vote applied to poor whites who were hurt by these laws as well.\n\n Irrelevant to my point.\n When the law was applied JUST to the blacks and NEVER to the whites, it was ruled unconstitutional because it violates equal protection.\n That is my point. Equal Protection of the 14th amendment.\n \n The violation of the 14th amendment with a standard that is applied ONLY to gays and NEVER to straights is my point.\n \n \n \nI tried to specify that i was not refering to teh reason that people have sex. Usually this is different than the actual life giving purpose of it. I don't want you to think that I am prejudice. I know gay people. They are my friends and I love them, but I don't think it is right for them to marry into a gay relationship. I am the last person who should be called prejudice. You, for example, probably thought, by my words, that I was a strict conservative, but technically, I am more liberal.\n\n As another \"black\" analogy, the people who were \"just\" against interracial marriage and not against other forms of black equality thought themselves pretty tolerant and even-handed as well.\n \n But regardless, where do you stand on civil unions?\n \n \n \nWhen you talk about \"which religion\" i had mentioned that almost every ancient civilization had a form of heterosexual marriage, and many religions created marriage as a part of their religion. I have never heard that the church begged for married couples to have extra rights. Are you sure that the church was responsible for that?\n\n A specific \"church\"? No.\n But the members of the church gave up any claim to exclusivity, while the church made no complaints.\n And it's too late. The church (or its members) can't ask for exclusivity that they gave up.\n \n And another parallel you should probably be aware of...\n \n \"In the US marriage was a personal and family event until reconstruction after the Civil War when according to Black's Law Dictionary an application to the State was required for inter-racial marriage and if the application was approved the privilege was granted then a marriage license\" and certificate of marriage was issued by the State.\"\n http://www.answers.com/topic/marriage-license\n \n \n \nEven if so, I do think that gay couples should have equal benefits. I just don't think they should wed.\n\n So it's \"civil unions\" then that you prefer?\n Understood....",
