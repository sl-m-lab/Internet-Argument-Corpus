Nobody is threatening their existance. Those thousands of lebanese civilians that Israel recently blew up also had a right to exist. Now israel wants hezbollah disarmed so NEXT TIME israel gets a wild hair to blow up stuff in Lebanon, they can do so without fear of resistance.\n \n Face it, Bassman, the Israelis are in violation of more UN resolutions than any other country. THEYT have violated EVERY treaty and ceasfire they have ever signed. Hell, they just violated a treaty with the US that said they could not use cluster bombs on civilians. \n \n The US recently invaded Iraq, killing over 100,000 civilians in the process and destabilizing the entire nation because some of us believed that our culture was so superior to the Arab culture that it was our duty to impose it on them at the point of a gun.
