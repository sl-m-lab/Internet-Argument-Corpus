   "Atheist Antony Flew has said that the \"onus of proof must lie upon the theist.\" (The Presumption of Atheism (London: Pemberton, 1976), page 14.)\n \n Unless compelling reasons for God&#8217;s existence can be given, there is the \"presumption of atheism.\" Another atheist, Michael Scriven, considers the lack of evidence for God&#8217;s existence and the lack of evidence for Santa Claus on the same level. However, the presumption of atheism actually turns out to be presumptuousness. We all must remember that the atheist also shares the burden of proof, which I [Paul Copan] will attempt to demonstrate below. \n \n First, even if the theist could not muster good arguments for God&#8217;s existence, atheism still would not be shown to be true. The outspoken atheist Kai Nielsen recognizes this:\"To show that an argument is invalid or unsound is not to show that the conclusion of the argument is false....All the proofs of God&#8217;s existence may fail, but it still may be the case that God exists.\"Second, the \"presumption of atheism\" demonstrates a rigging of the rules of philosophical debate in order to play into the hands of the atheist, who himself makes a truth claim. Alvin Plantinga correctly argues that the atheist does not treat the statements \"God exists\" and \"God does not exist\" in the same manner. The atheist assumes that if one has no evidence for God&#8217;s existence, then one is obligated to believe that God does not exist &#8212; whether or not one has evidence against God&#8217;s existence. What the atheist fails to see is that atheism is just as much a claim to know something (\"God does not exist\") as theism (\"God exists\"). \n \n Therefore, the atheist&#8217;s denial of God&#8217;s existence needs just as much substantiation as does the theist&#8217;s claim; the atheist must give plausible reasons for rejecting God&#8217;s existence.\n \n Third, in the absence of evidence for God&#8217;s existence, agnosticism, not atheism, is the logical presumption. Even if arguments for God&#8217;s existence do not persuade, atheism should not be presumed because atheism is not neutral; pure agnosticism is. Atheism is justified only if there is sufficient evidence against God&#8217;s existence. \n \n Fourth, to place belief in Santa Claus or mermaids and belief in God on the same level is mistaken. The issue is not that we have no good evidence for these mythical entities; rather, we have strong evidence that they do not exist. Absence of evidence is not at all the same as evidence of absence, which some atheists fail to see. \n \n Moreover, the theist can muster credible reasons for belief in God. For example, one can argue that the contingency of the universe &#8212; in light of Big Bang cosmology, the expanding universe, and the second law of thermodynamics (which implies that the universe has been \"wound up\" and will eventually die a heat death) &#8212; demonstrates that the cosmos has not always been here. It could not have popped into existence uncaused, out of absolutely nothing, because we know that whatever begins to exist has a cause. A powerful First Cause like the God of theism plausibly answers the question of the universe&#8217;s origin.

It is possible to argue that no conceivable evidence could arise that would modify the logic of the atheist's point of view.\n An agnostic shares the observations of atheists concerning God's existence - but chooses to leave the question open pending the arrival of any convincing evidence.\n\n \n Ha! How illogical, the Bible says seek God and you will find him!\n \n IMO, many are running from the reality of God and claim a profound belief in the non-existence of God! And, what of Belief, Faith and Knowldege?\n \n Why Bother With Truth?\n \n How can we know the world around us? \n \n How can we know God? \n \n How can we know anything at all? \n \n These are some of the questions of epistemology, the study of theories of knowledge. \n \n Epistemology has two main goals. First, we want to find as much truth as possible. And second, we want to avoid as much falsehood as possible. These two goals stand in tension with each other. I can easily acquire very large amounts of truth. If I were totally gullible, I&#8217;d believe just everything I hear. That would give me the largest number of true beliefs possible. But the problem is that along with all the true beliefs I&#8217;d acquire, I&#8217;d also obtain many false beliefs. So I&#8217;d have some needles of truth hidden in a very large haystack of error. That wouldn&#8217;t help me much.\n \n Similarly, I could easily avoid as much error as possible. If I were completely skeptical, I&#8217;d disbelieve everything. That would safeguard me against every falsehood. But the problem is that I&#8217;d miss out on all truth whatsoever&#8212;and some truth might be very important. So that wouldn&#8217;t help me much either.\n \n No one urges us to believe absolutely everything. But some very important and influential thinkers do advise us to believe nothing (or very little)&#8212;or at least they recommend that we believe only when an idea is incredibly well supported. This is skepticism. \n \n Skepticism puts most of its energies into avoiding error, and very little effort into finding truth. So how can we develop an understanding of epistemology that goes beyond skepticism? How can we balance our desire for truth with our need to avoid error?\n \n Truth and Knowledge\n \n It&#8217;s critical to distinguish truth and knowledge. Too many people equate these two concepts, with chaotic results. But truth and knowledge are different concepts. Put simply, true affirmations are those that correspond to reality. So truth is a characteristic of statements that properly describe aspects of the real world. This is called the correspondence view of truth.\n \n The correspondence view of truth isn&#8217;t a method for testing truth claims or discovering knowledge. It&#8217;s a definition of what we mean when we say that a statement &#8220;is true.&#8221; According to the correspondence view, what makes a statement true is reality itself.\n \n A Brief Introduction to the Theory of Knowledge - Click Here",

   "Morality in Monkeys\n\n \n I am going to address Monkey morality and cultural relativism in one post!\n \n Re: Objective Moral Values:\n \n \n Is morality relative? \n \n Do monkeys really have morals or ethics?\n \n Are we in reality talking about nothing more than the by-product of evolutionary and social development? Is one culture&#8217;s virtue really another culture&#8217;s vice? And, accordingly, just a matter of preference as Betrand Russell said, like deciding on flavors or colours?\n \n I submit, that morality is not a matter of opinion, shaped by our preferences, or our moods and feelings.\n \n Thomas Cahill, in his book,The Gift of the Jews reminds us, Judaism alone differed.[from pagan societies] According to the Jews' way of viewing life, events actually move forward; they do not merely repeat themselves, as with the cycles of seasons. In their rejection of this universal mode of thought, Cahill writes,\n \"The Jews were the first people to break out of this circle.. . . It may be said with some justice that theirs is the only new idea that human beings had ever had. The results of this utterly transformative way of understanding life? In Cahill's words, Most of our best words, in fact &#8212; new, adventure, surprise; unique individual, person, vocation; time, history, future; freedom, progress, spirit; faith, hope, justice &#8212; are the gifts of the Jews.\n The Ten Commandments, Cahill writes:\n  \"for the first time human beings are offered a code without justification. Because this is God's code no justification is required. . . Who but God can speak ten words &#8212; 'Thou-shalt' and 'Thou-shalt-not' &#8212; with such authority that no further words are needed?\"\n Good is good because God says it is good; God does not say something is good because it is so already. God is the source of morality; morality does not exist without God.\n \n Moral sentiments &#8212; \"I do not like killing\"; \"I feel that stealing is wrong &#8212; may exist without God, but they are only sentiments. (that can change with the winds) Just consider the cultural relativism of Nazis Germany and the genocide of Jews, Gypsies and the crippled or impaired; after the war, the leaders were placed on trial at Nuremberg, they said, they were just following orders, and that this was the Nazis new local cultural ethic, but the judge said, \"No sir, you will answer to a higher Judge - God!\" (The absolute moral standard) Depite what Nietzsche had concluded, it was he who was dead and God who is alive! (Friedrich Nietzsche, the great atheist of the last century who proclaimed the death of God, understood that the death of God meant the destruction of all meaning and value in life ')\n \n Now, can Atheists be morally upright? (Note I am always amused when this is asked in a society built on Judeo-Christian values!) Do societies or people construct fine ethical systems without God?\n \n Really, show me one! Someone mentioned ancient Inca culture of Peru. Ha! :lmbo: They practiced live human sacrifice! Look at the first fascists, the greek Spartans where murder and rape was used as tools of tyranny. Ancient Greece, or Rome were societies built on slavery,(over turned by Christianity) and where infraticide was practiced with the blessings of the gods. Women were treated as little better than cattle.\n \n In our modern times the atheistic ethicist Kai Nielsen of the University of Calgary, proclaims the bankruptcy of his own reason, when he writes, \n We have not been able to show that reason requires the moral point of view, or that all really rational persons should not be individual egoists or classical immoralists. (amoral) Reason doesn't decide here. The picture I have painted for you is not a pleasant one. Reflection on it depresses me . . . . Pure practical reason, even with a good knowledge of the facts, will not take you to morality.\n Today, in India, the Bible need not be preached for the Untouchables to cry out in the suffering of their unjust treatment at the hands of their oppressors - the Brahmin caste (class). Today, Untouchables and the other lower caste members are being set free by Christianity from the chains and oppression of bad Karma. See: ChristianityToday.com\n \n These people know intuititively, that they are worthy of diginity and repect, and yes, LOVE, because God is infinite and of infinite value, and we are created in God's likeness, and represent a high value loved by God and worthy of dignity - even the lowest sewer worker, working in the lowest sewer system on Earth.",

   "\n Good is good because God says it is good; God does not say something is good because it is so already. God is the source of morality; morality does not exist without God.\n \n\n wow, pretty big statement to make. He never said food was good, but some hungry people would likely back me up on this. You talk of the 10 commandments. Those aren't new ideas about morals, those are called instinct. We need the will to live for the species to survive. If we didn't have a drive to live then the human race wouldn't live on. Same if people didn't reproduce. All things stem from this instinct to want to live. Obviously this is the reason for not killing. Instincually, we don't want to die, so think we shouldn't kill. Now to live we need certain things, such as food, shelter, etc. If these are stolen we won't survive, therefor we shouldn't steal. I don't know all 10 commandments, but I'm sure I could justify every one in this manner. It isn't because they are commandments that they are good, it's because they're good that they're commandments. God didn't say that computers were good, yet we're all typing on one. Morality is defined by another rule. Do unto others as you would want done to you (the golden rule). As I said, I don't believe in God, but I still follow all the morals you do, I just don't pray or believe in God.",

While in Leipzig visiting a friend, Nietzsche happened across a philosophical work which would influence his thought in profound ways. That book was Arthur Schopenhauer's two volume, The World as Will and Representation, published in 1819. \n \n Schopenhauer was a strange man. He was educated at Germany's finest institutions including Gotha, Weimar (the home of Goethe) and Jena. In 1819, he became a lecturer at the University of Berlin. While at Berlin Schopenhauer held his lectures at the same time as Hegel but without success. No one came to hear Schopenhauer lecture. \n \n His major contribution was his concept of Subjective Idealism -- that the world is my idea, a phantasm of the mind, and therefore, in itself, meaningless. Will, the active side of our nature, or Impulse, is the key to the one thing we know directly from the inside -- the self, and therefore the key to the understanding of all things. \n \n It gets better:\n \n Although the will is entirely real, it is not free, nor does it have any ultimate purpose. Rather, it is all-consuming, pointless, and negative, \"all life is suffering.\" \n \n His ideas were strongly influenced by the Upanishads and Buddhism. Schopenhauer was the first major European philosopher to make a point of atheism; however, he admired the asceticism of Christianity and Buddhism, declaring that after removing the dogmas these religions have as their philosophical underpinning the abolition of the will. \n \n Schopenhauer's strongest influence was on Nietzsche, Freud, Wittgenstein, and musician Richard Wagner, whose Tristan and Isolde puts to music the blind will. \n \n (That Blind Will tune must have been Hitler's fave')\n \n Friedrich Nietzsche was later to call himself &#8220;the Anti-Christ,&#8221; and wrote a book by that title. He argued for atheism as follows:\n &#8220;I will now disprove the existence of all gods. If there were gods, how could I bear not to be a god? Consequently, there are no gods.&#8221; \n He scorned reason as well as faith, often deliberately contradicted himself, said that &#8220;a sneer is infinitely more noble that a syllogism&#8221; and appealed to passion, rhetoric and even deliberate hatred rather than reason. \n \n He saw love as &#8220;the greatest danger&#8221; and morality as mankind's worst weakness. He died insane, of syphilis, at home with his Mother, but just after leaving an asylum. He signed his last letters &#8220;the Crucified One.&#8221; \n \n In his book:&#8220;The Genealogy of Morals&#8221;, he claimed that morality was an invention of the weak (especially the Jews, and then the Christians) to weaken the strong. The sheep convinced the wolf to act like a sheep. This is unnatural, argues Nietzsche, and seeing morality's unnatural origin in resentment at inferiority will free us from its power over us. \n \n What would replace God? \n \n The same being who will replace man; the Superman or \u00dcbermensch Nietzsche's magnum opus and masterpiece, &#8220;Thus Spake Zarathustra&#8221;, celebrates this new god. \n \n Nietzsche call &#8220;Zarathustra&#8221; the new Bible, and told the world to &#8220;throw away all other books; you have my &#8220;Zarathustra.&#8221; It is intoxicating rhetoric, and it has captivated adolescents for generations. It was written in only a few days, in a frenzy, perhaps of literally demon-inspired &#8220;automatic writing.&#8221; No book ever written contains more Jungian archetypes, like a fireworks display of images from the unconscious. \n \n Nietzsche wrote of his: superman (\u00dcbermensch) or Overman -- humanity that had evolved beyond our current state into a more powerful and more awesome form. Thus humanity was between superman and beast. Nietzsche wrote:\n What is the ape to man? A laughingstock or a painful embarrassment. And man shall be just that for Overman&#8230;[We] have made our way from worm to man, and much in [us] is still worm&#8230;[So] man is a rope tied between beast and Overman&#8230;[and so] what is great in man is that he is bridge and not an end.\n Thus Nietzsche looked forward to man evolving into superman.\n \n Quoting: The Breakdown of Morals and Christian Education, by \u00c9TIENNE GILSON (Adapted) \n \n This, \"God is Dead\" revolution was meant to be the most tremendous revolution that ever took place in world history. At the very beginning, those who envisaged a godless society experienced a feeling of liberation. At last, man was going to be free! \n \n However, it was Nietzsche himself who had been fully aware of the fact that, when man should at last be liberated from the authority of God, he would find himself face to face with the entirely new task of creating his own moral values, that is, determining what should be considered as right or wrong, good or evil. \n \n Next came Jean Paul Sartre, a typical representative of the French school of existentialists. And, expounding on this philosophy, at the 1950 philosophical Congress of Bordeaux (France), another French philosopher, Polin, calmly announced that he was going to speak against the traditional notion of moral \"wisdom\" because, so far as he could see, there were no objective moral values. (Bingo, but perhaps it was Nietzsche or Rosseau who said it first.)\n \n Only that is morally good, he said, which we declare to be so, and only what we specifically affirm to be morally wrong is actually morally wrong. Man, said Polin, is the creator of moral values. Now this is a very extreme position indeed, especially for a \"professor of Moral Philosophy and of the Science of Education\" in a State university, yet, after all, it is a consistent one. \n \n For indeed, if there is no God, who but man himself can teach man the distinction between what is right and what is wrong?\n \n This is perfectly logical. However, when all is said and done, there is still one more question to be answered. \n \n What do we mean by man?\n \n Man in general does not exist; there are individual men only, and who, among them, will have authority to teach us the distinction between good and evil? Thus far, no one. And this is what I call the true breakdown of morals, not indeed the all too frequent breaking of a moral code, but the new fact that today there is no moral code to break.\n \n Quoted in part and adapted:\n \n \u00c9tienne Gilson. \"The Breakdown of Morals and Christian Education.\" (Candlemas Day 1952). \n \n This lecture was delivered in the Adult Education Program of St. Michael's College at the University of Toronto. \n \n THE AUTHOR \n \n \u00c9tienne Gilson was born in Paris, France, in 1884. He was educated at the University of Paris, and for eleven years was a member of its faculty. From 1932 until 1951, he was Professor of Mediaeval Philosophy at the College de France. He was guest professor at various universities such as the Angelicum (Rome), Oxford, Cambridge, Aberdeen, Harvard, ....",

It was written in only a few days, in a frenzy, perhaps of literally demon-inspired \"automatic writing.\" No book ever written contains more Jungian archetypes, like a fireworks display of images from the unconscious. \n \n Nietzsche wrote of his: superman (\u00dcbermensch) or Overman -- humanity that had evolved beyond our current state into a more powerful and more awesome form. Thus humanity was between superman and beast. Nietzsche wrote:\n What is the ape to man? A laughingstock or a painful embarrassment. And man shall be just that for Overman...[We] have made our way from worm to man, and much in [us] is still worm...[So] man is a rope tied between beast and Overman...[and so] what is great in man is that he is bridge and not an end.\n Thus Nietzsche looked forward to man evolving into superman.\n \n Quoting: The Breakdown of Morals and Christian Education, by \u00c9TIENNE GILSON (Adapted) \n \n This, \"God is Dead\" revolution was meant to be the most tremendous revolution that ever took place in world history. At the very beginning, those who envisaged a godless society experienced a feeling of liberation. At last, man was going to be free! \n \n However, it was Nietzsche himself who had been fully aware of the fact that, when man should at last be liberated from the authority of God, he would find himself face to face with the entirely new task of creating his own moral values, that is, determining what should be considered as right or wrong, good or evil. \n \n Next came Jean Paul Sartre, a typical representative of the French school of existentialists. And, expounding on this philosophy, at the 1950 philosophical Congress of Bordeaux (France), another French philosopher, Polin, calmly announced that he was going to speak against the traditional notion of moral \"wisdom\" because, so far as he could see, there were no objective moral values. (Bingo, but perhaps it was Nietzsche or Rosseau who said it first.)\n \n Only that is morally good, he said, which we declare to be so, and only what we specifically affirm to be morally wrong is actually morally wrong. Man, said Polin, is the creator of moral values. Now this is a very extreme position indeed, especially for a \"professor of Moral Philosophy and of the Science of Education\" in a State university, yet, after all, it is a consistent one. \n \n For indeed, if there is no God, who but man himself can teach man the distinction between what is right and what is wrong?\n \n This is perfectly logical. However, when all is said and done, there is still one more question to be answered. \n \n What do we mean by man?\n \n Man in general does not exist; there are individual men only, and who, among them, will have authority to teach us the distinction between good and evil? Thus far, no one. And this is what I call the true breakdown of morals, not indeed the all too frequent breaking of a moral code, but the new fact that today there is no moral code to break.\n \n Quoted in part and adapted:\n \n \u00c9tienne Gilson. \"The Breakdown of Morals and Christian Education.\" (Candlemas Day 1952). \n \n This lecture was delivered in the Adult Education Program of St. Michael's College at the University of Toronto. \n \n THE AUTHOR \n \n \u00c9tienne Gilson was born in Paris, France, in 1884. He was educated at the University of Paris, and for eleven years was a member of its faculty. From 1932 until 1951, he was Professor of Mediaeval Philosophy at the College de France. He was guest professor at various universities such as the Angelicum (Rome), Oxford, Cambridge, Aberdeen, Harvard, ....\n\n \n If you think that morality is another \"gift from God\", why don't you argue the case in your own words ? Your cut and paste citations are tiresome and I doubt that many people have the patience to read them through. Get down to a few specifics and salient points: stop trying to impress us with your \"overwhelming evidence\" from sundry sources (in big blue ink !) which if you had confidence in your own convictions would not be necessary.",

For Nietzsche, the tragic poets were the great Greeks, and the philosophers, starting with Socrates, were the small ones, pale and passionless. All the Western world had followed Socrates and his rationalism and moralism, and had denied the other, darker side of man, the tragic side. \n \n Nietzsche instead exalted tragedy, chaos, disorder and irrationality, symbolized by the god Dionysus, god of growth and drunken orgies. He claimed that Socrates had turned the world instead to the worship of Apollo, god of the sun, light, order and reason. But the fate of Nietzsche's god Dionysus was soon to overtake Nietzsche himself; as Dionysus was literally torn apart by the Titans, supernatural monsters of the underworld, Nietzsche's mind was to be cracked asunder by his own inner Titans.\n \n [And, IMO, these Titans got to Hitler as well!]",

   "Anthony Flew, perhaps the most influential living atheist philosopher, has concluded that there is a God based on the scientific evidence of a designer in nature. Although not a Christian, Flew said he can no longer espouse atheism beause the science no longer supports that position.\n \n The Associated Press article can be found::HERE. \n \n Flew concludes that a higher power, with intelligence and intent, was involved in the creation of life on earth. \n \n Anthony Flew has been one of the leading atheist philosophers for some time now. His father was a Methodist minister, but he left Christianity and became an atheist at the age of 15. He is a Professor of Philosophy and has written well over a dozen books on philosophy and atheism. Over the years he has engaged in many debates with theists on the question of the existeince of God--always espousing the side of the atheist. \n \n Quote:\n \n As Flew states in a new video being released, biologists' investigation of DNA \"has shown, by the almost unbelievable complexity of the arrangements which are needed to produce (life), that intelligence must have been involved.\" This makes it clear that Flew sees God's hand active not only in the big bang, but in the specific creation of life. In other words, a purely naturalistic Darwinism is insufficient to explain the existence of life. According to the AP, \"He accepts Darwinian evolution but doubts it can explain the ultimate origins of life.\" \n \n Skeptics are afraid to admit that a rational atheist could ever slide back towards a belief in God.\n \n I have seen murmers that perhaps Flew is getting old and simply afraid of dying (Flew is 81). This is just wishful thinking. Rational, informed, and intelligent people can and do believe in God for rational, informed, and intelligent reasons. Flew is now one of them. \n \n Chistian Cadre Blogspot.com",

   "Fortunate for us, Flew isn't a biologist. DNA is actually riduculously simple, and requires nothing more than itself to priduce the most basic for of life.\n 'Atheist philophers' seem to suffer from a tendancy of wanting to make nice flowerly and impressive looking quotes, sadly as shown in this case, they really mean nothing. \n \n There is really no real problem with admitting that you think their might be a creator - nor will mnay people argue with you about it. However as soon as you start p[reaching about a benevolent diety who gets involved personally to other people you sadly hit the hard wall of truth. There isn't. God may of created the universe, but he doesn't care any more if he did or just shows such a marginal intrest to hardly warrant worship at all (if there really was a reason other than simply threat of brute force anyway).\n \n Simply put Richbee, even if you are right - this isn't a nice god and I am much happier beleiving this thing doesn't exist. Come the end times I would still be happier to throw my soul in with all those who oppose him than bend my knee to someone who has tried to decieve me purely for the purpose of torturing me later. It isn't atheists who are nervous, we are quite happy in our beliefs, its the theists who fear more than anything that their beliefs are right.",
