   "...have a lot in common.\n \n John Forbes Kerry and those who support him seem to be prone to puffery and inflated proclaimations of his voting record. The AFL-CIO claims he's sponsored 57 bills that have passed the Senate. (It doesn't say they became law.) Other sites claim he has sponsored \"hundreds\" of bills that have become law.\n \n In reality, he hasn't sponsored many bills...and few of them went anywhere. Of the ones that were passed, more than half had nothing to do with anything that really matters.\n \n http://www.factcheck.org/article.aspx?docID=134\n \n Summary\n John Kerry is fond of saying \"I led the fight\" on a lot of things -- against Arctic drilling, against Bush's Medicare prescription drug legislation, for federal grants for 100,000 new police officers, against Newt Gingrich's attempts to lessen environmental regulations.\n But reporters who cover Congress often gave others credit for the leading roles in some of those fights -- with scant mention of Kerry.\n And The Associated Press last July found that only eight laws had Kerry as their lead sponsor, five of them \"ceremonial,\" two relating to the fishing industry, and one providing federal grants to support small businesses owned by women.\n \n \n \n \n http://forum.johnkerry.com/lofiversion/index.php/t33963.html\n \n \n http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1061305/posts\n \n \n http://profiles.numbersusa.com/improfile.php3?DistSend=MA&VIPID=359\n \n This document is a record and analysis of all of Sen. Kerry's immigration related congressional votes, cosponsorships, and other immigration actions during his career in Congress. Immigration Profiles is the only exhaustive source for this information available in one place.\n (If you are reading this on paper, note the \"Last Updated\" date above. Consult the website www.NumbersUSA.com for any new or changed information, which occurs often.)\n \n View Report Card of Sen. Kerry's Immigration Actions \n \n Career Record Source: Congressional Record\n Leans toward higher immigration, population growth, foreign labor. \n \n \n \n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponsorship_of_legislation_by_John_Kerry\n \n Sponsorship of legislation by John Kerry\n From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n John Kerry has sponsored or cosponsored hundreds of bills during his time as a Senator. Areas of concern in the bills include small business concerns, education, terrorism, veterans' and POW/MIA issues, and marine resource protection. A full list of Kerry's sponsored legislation is available on his Senate web site; (http://kerry.senate.gov/bandwidth/issues/legislation.html) see also the AFL-CIO web site (http://www.aflcio.org/issuespolitics/politics/kerry_bills.cfm) for a selected list. There have been some reports that Senator Kerry credits himself publicly with legislative initiatives which are not actually his. However, his supporters tend to argue that Kerry has a collaborative law making style, which also results in joint-sponsor legislation.\n [edit] \n \n Sponsorship of Legislation\n During his Senate career, Kerry has been primary sponsor of the following bills (excluding resolutions and amendments sponsored). This table does not count bills which Kerry has co-sponsored.\n Session Years Bills Sponsored Signed into law\n 99th 1985-86 15 0\n 100th 1987-88 21 1 (http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/D?d100:22:./temp/~bdAOxC::/bss/d100query.html)\n 101st 1989-90 44 0\n 102nd 1991-92 28 1\n 103rd 1993-94 27 1, 2\n 104th 1995-96 32 0\n 105th 1997-98 19 0\n 106th 1999-00 33 1\n 107th 2001-02 81 1, 2, 3\n 108th 2003-04 30 1\n \n \n \n \n \n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/08/politics/campaign/08KERR.html?ex=1391576400&en=d6aa52e559f5194c&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND\n \n \n His presidential ambitions were assumed almost from the day he arrived in Washington. But around the Senate Mr. Kerry is often described as aloof, patrician, a bit of a lone ranger. \n \n \n \n \n http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=404851\n \n \n \n \n http://www.forclark.com/story/2004/1/30/20530/8157\n \n Kerry is prone to \"political puffery\" when it comes to his legislative record and claims of having \"led the right\" on a number of issues.",

I've also not claimed to agree with everything he has done. As a matter of fact, I've disagreed with him on more than one occasion.\n \n I don't know that Kerry has admitted to any mistakes. He just changes his stance without explaination. It's hard to disagree with a man that takes both sides.",
