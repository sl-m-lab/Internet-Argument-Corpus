He has already been lauded as a hero for admitting his sin and taking it public. Just think, we live in an age when a couple of hundred hollywood elites have petitioned in support of Roman Polanski. I mean, since he's one of them and has directed some well known films he should automatically get a pass for first drugging and then raping a 13 year old girl 31 years ago. Poor guy had to live in France as a fugitive so he has paid his price, right? Excuse me while I go spit out the bile that's rising in my throat. emoticon_frazzled http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,557286,00.html\n \n But you are right about other women coming out of the woodwork with stories of affairs with him.

I have no need to compensate for anything.\n \n I am a Volvo driver, in our household we have 4 Volvos, 2 old 240's one S70, and a 940 station wagon.\n \n The last car I bought, and probably my final, and that my son drives to work daily, is a Mercedes C180, kompressor. I bought it several years ago almost new, it was in pristine condition (the proverbial old lady's car) because it is economical, it has rear wheel drive, a superb suspension, front and rear, handles like a dream and has enough power to navigate the cut and throat traffic of Sydney. Of course it has superb quality and engineering, although being German it has some quirks and teutonic peculiarities.\n \n I bought it not to show off ( I didn't build it) but only because Volvo abandoned rear wheel drive many years ago.\n \n A big penis and big balls do not make a man J.P.\n \n 1200 hp of compensation means that you have something very tiny between your legs to require such a massive compensation.",

Didn't see A-Rod or Spitzer getting all up in arms about his jokes, did you? At least Letterman can laugh at himself and his situation. Perhaps Palin should take a lesson from him. I will say however that Letterman should stick simply to making jokes about Palin and not her family. After all, it's not likely that Palin will give him any lack of material. \n \n And I doubt that Palin can even spell excoriating...oh wait...neither can y...errr, nevermind.",
