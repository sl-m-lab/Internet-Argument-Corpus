We're mired down in another Vietnam, tax cuts have been legislated in a time of falling tax revenue, the still cost unknown prescription drug plan approved, federal social engineering in education enacted with the 'No Child Left Behind' program designed to emphasize equality and diminish excellence and, last but not least, they're supposedly still looking for Bin Laden. Another four years should put us in an economic position where all someone has to do is flush the toilet.... \n \n And someone is complaining about a lawyer using the system to earn a paltry $30-million or another smart and fortunate enough to marry wealth? Sounds like sour grapes to me.",

Kerry is the challenger. I'm waiting for HIM to define exactly how he is going to pay for over $2 BILLION$ dollars he's promised to spend, on the campaign trail, while promising to raise taxes by less then 800 million dollars. That is over 1.2 $BILLION$ dollar deficit before he even takes office! If he does take office he'll still have two wars which he says he'll continue to fight. And a recovering but fragile economy to deal with.\n \n This J.F.K. doesn't have the moral \"gravitas\" to be The President Of the United States of America.
