Pete King (R-L.I.). \"It's essential that we support our troops.\"\n \n He also said attacking Iraq was necessary after 9/11. \"You do not defeat Al Qaeda until you stabilize the Middle East, and that's not possible as long as Saddam Hussein is in power.\"",

However, the tens of thousands of dollars he paid to families of suicide bombers via Hezbollah and Hamas caused waves of suicide attacks. Funny how there are now far less suicide attacks in Israel now that the money has dried up. \n \n The simple fact is that as money has gone away from Hezbollah and Hamas, their abilities to influence the process between the Palestinians and Israelis has waned, along with their ability to carry out operations. So I take issue with any notion that middle east was better off with Hussein in power.\n \n Is there conflict? Of course, is there anyone here so stupid that thought the middle east was goign to be sorted out and settled by hoping and wishing?",
