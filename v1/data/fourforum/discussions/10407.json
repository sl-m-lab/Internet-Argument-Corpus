   "Wei Liu: Awakening People 5-Striking Independency of Taiwan or Democracy?\n \n \n September 20, 2007\n \n \n Now in September 2007, the Chinese Communist regime once again voiced that it's going to attack Taiwan if Taiwan holds a universal vote by the people of 23 million there to decide whether they want to join UN along with its universal vote of the presidential election in March, 2008. The Communist regime said that Taiwan joining UN was a sign of it getting independency, which has cheated some Americans, including some American officials. \n \n If we look back a little bit, we see that after the death of Mao Zedong in 1976, there are three times of the Chinese Communist regime obviously voicing its military threat upon Taiwan and launching out the large scale military maneuver of attacking Taiwan. In each of the three times, it dwells its doing upon striking Taiwan getting its independency. \n \n The first time was in 1996 during the first universal vote for the presidential election of Taiwan. That was the first time that every one of the 23 million people in Taiwan has a ballot to choose their president. With explosions of the shells and bombs of the Communist regime within 100 miles to Taiwan, the first people elected president Li Denghui came out peacefully and he didn't announce the independency of Taiwan afterwards. \n \n The second time was in 2000 during the second universal vote for the presidential election of Taiwan. That was the second time that every one of the 23 million people in Taiwan has a ballot to choose their president. With explosions of the shells and bombs of the Communist regime on its coastal area, the candidate from the Democratic Progressive Party Chen Shuibian got elected and he didn't announce the independency of Taiwan afterwards. \n \n The third time is now. The Chinese Communist regime voices that it is going to attack Taiwan if Taiwan holds the universal vote to join UN in March 2008, and it launched a big scale of military maneuver in its coastal province Shandong Province in September 2007. \n \n Even if Taiwan joins UN, it shouldn't be regarded as a sign of independency. Taiwan has a long history with UN. As an importance area to fight against Japan in World War II, People's China founded by the Nationals gained the membership of UN in 1945 and acted as one of its five standing nations. In 1949, the Nationals got defeated by the Chinese communist and withdrew to Taiwan. \n \n Since then, it held its membership in UN until 1971 it was replaced by the Chinese Communist regime in the name of People's Republic of China. So from 1949 to 1971, Taiwan held the membership of UN for 22 years. From 1993, every year Taiwan submitted its request to join UN in the name of People's China, and each time was turned down by the influence of the Chinese Communist regime. Then this time, Taiwan wants to hold a universal vote of Taiwan people to decide whether they join UN in the name of Taiwan. As we see, it is mostly the Chinese Communist regime oppressing People's China with its controlling area being Taiwan that makes Taiwan wants to use a different name that is Taiwan. Thus, we shouldn't regard Taiwan's joining UN as a sign of independency. Otherwise, it has already had the independency for 22 years. \n \n As the common people from mainland China, we resent what the Communist regime is doing. Every time their large scale military maneuver makes the prices go up by 30% or more. The moving the troops costs lots of money. For instance, the Midway Battle launched by the Japanese navy in May and June 1942 lasting for 19 days consumed the oil as much as its consumption of a year in the peace time. As the above shows, the Communist regime just wants to divert the attention of us 1.3 billion Chinese people away from the democratic election of Taiwan. We noticed that all the three times of its openly warlike stance are on the occasion of the universal vote of the 23 million people of Taiwan, and there is no such stance when Taiwan does not hold the universal vote of the people there. We cannot believe this is just coincidence. Taiwan people choosing their own president, showing their feeling about UN has nothing to do with getting the independency. \n \n Why do the Chinese Communist regime consisting of those bureau directors holding less than 0.1% of the whole population strike democracy? Because since 1949 its coming into power in China, it grabs all the natural resources like the land bestowed by God for people to live, and makes people pay high prices set by it to have a place to live, to have water to drink. Just in this field, every one of the 1.3 billion Chinese in his life has to earn 40,000 U. S. dollars for those bureau directors for nothing. Meanwhile, the Communist regime uses force to monopolize many trades, including real reality, school, hospital, communication, media, agriculture, and decides people's pay and expense/price. Through which, it actually collects over 80% of people's income for tax. These are the two reasons that make Chinese people poor. Now in 2007, the average income of 1 billion Chinese adults is about 50 U. S. dollars a month, unable to solve the basic life needs like housing, education and medical care at all, living in the house of the grandparents perpetually. Meanwhile, the bureau director of that regime gets about half a million of U. S. dollars a year even without taking the money from his office. \n \n (Several more English essays of me in democratizing China are in my blog http://www.boxun.com/hero/flake/ . At the end of the page, you click the Chinese sign right below the text, and then it will go to the next page. Also, the common Chinese people like me can come to this forum, and the Chinese communists can come here too. )\n \n \n The Communist regime is basically a bunch of robbers. Of course, they will strike democracy so that they can continue robbing people to the extreme. Though over 99% of Chinese people should want to remove that Communist regime, many of them are still cheated by the media controlled by that regime. \n \n We hope American people, including American officials, not to get cheated by the Chinese Communist regime. Taiwan's having a universal vote by its own people to show their feeling about UN is not a sign of independency. By showing a warlike stance toward the democratic Taiwan, the Chinese Communist regime diverts many Chinese people's attention away from their rights of choosing someone being fair to them as their president, and that regime tries to use any forces, including that of America, to strike the democracy in Taiwan, which is also the race of Chinese and is within 100 miles to mainland China.",
