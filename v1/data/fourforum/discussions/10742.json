   "To All My Democrat Friends:\n \n Please accept with no obligation, implied or implicit, my best wishes for an environmentally conscious, socially responsible, low-stress, non-addictive, gender-neutral celebration of the winter solstice holiday, practiced within the most enjoyable traditions of the religious persuasion of your choice, or secular practices of your choice, with respect for the religious/secular persuasion and/or traditions of others, or their choice not to practice religious or secular traditions at all. I also wish you a fiscally successful, personally fulfilling and medically uncomplicated recognition of the onset of the generally accepted calendar year 2008, but not without due respect for the calendars of choice of other cultures whose contributions to society have helped make America great. Not to imply that America is necessarily greater than any other country nor the only America in the Western Hemisphere . Also, this wish is made without regard to the race, creed, color, age, physical ability, religious faith or sexual preference of the wishee.\n \n \n To My Republican Friends:\n \n Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! \n \n Here's a Christmas Card for you. Pass it around if you have friends you want to reach out to and wish a merry christmas to.\n http://www.jacquielawson.com/viewcard.asp?cont=1&hdn=0&pv=3111930\n Here's a story I enjoyed receiving and got a chuckle out of:\n WHO IS JACK SCHITT?\n \n For some time many of us have wondered just who is Jack Schitt? We find ourselves at a loss when someone says, 'You don't know Jack Schitt!' Well, thanks to my genealogy efforts, you can now respond in an intellectual way.\n \n Jack Schitt is the only son of Awe Schitt. Awe Schitt, the fertilizer magnate, married O. Schitt, the owner of Needeep N. Schitt, Inc. They had one son, Jack.\n \n In turn, Jack Schitt married Noe Schitt. The deeply religious couple produced six children: Holie Schitt, Giva Schitt, Fulla Schitt, Bull Schitt, and the twins Deep Schitt and Dip Schitt.\n \n Against her parents' objections, Deep Schitt married Dumb Schitt, a high school dropout. After being married 15 years, Jack and Noe Schitt divorced. Noe Schitt later married Ted Sherlock, and because her kids were living with them, she wanted to keep her previous name. She was then known as Noe Schitt Sherlock.\n \n Meanwhile, Dip Schitt married Loda Schitt, and they produced a son with a rather nervous disposition named Chicken Schitt. Two of the other six children, Fulla Schitt and Giva Schitt, were inseparable throughout childhood and subsequently married the Happens brothers in a dual ceremony. The wedding announcement in the newspaper announced the\n Schitt-Happens nuptials. The Schitt-Happens children were Dawg, Byrd, and Horse.\n \n Bull Schitt, the prodigal son, left home to tour the world. He recently returned from Italy with his new Italian bride, Pisa Schitt.\n \n NOW when someone says, 'You don't know Jack Schitt,' you can correct them.\n \n Sincerely,\n Crock O. Schitt\n ",

   "Here are the stats on who posted on the \"Why Homophobic\" thread and how many posts they wrote. It is, as far as I know, the longest running thread this forum has ever had. And you can see for yourself who I stood almost all alone against. It's also quite obvious you TQ, and lyteboy were M.I.A. for that whole debate. So I don't run from debates I'm committed to and I have proven that more than any other poster on this forum by taking on all comers in this debate. BUT I DECIDE WHEN I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF ANY DEBATE I PARTICIPATE IN, NOT YOU OR LYTE. Here's the link if you want to read the debate. You will also see that samiinh, the next highest poster did nothing but waste bandwidth with his constant and unending Trolling through out the whole debate.\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=9912\n \n \nWhy Homophobic?

   "You and lyte seem to think you have been made the official debate enders on this forum and anyone who makes their point but refuses to answer to lies and misinformation is somehow running away or conceding some imaginary victory\n\n \n I asked you to point out where I lied, and what misinformation I posted. I also asked you to point out how and why the quotes I posted were out of context. You never did so. Instead, you stopped posting on the subject and came to this thread to begin insulting me.\n \n \nAs to me running from debates, check the longest running debate this forum has ever had and you will find it was me against your whole gang of philosophical cowards almost single handedly.\n\n Name calling again. Tsk tsk And how is it \"my gang\" when I never participated in it?\n \n \n And I never ran away from anyone or any issue raised in it.\n\n \n But did you address any issues raised by your opponents, or did you condescendingly refer to them as pseudo-intellectuals while hand waving away anything said to you without so much as addressing it?\n \n \nSo to accuse me of running from you out of fear\n \n Who said anything about fear? Freudian slip archie?\n \n \nSo you think calling something an archie is offensive to me?\n\n Nope, if you read my post, you would see I'm an advocate for changing the name.\n \nYou see I have a real life I live and don't depend on invisible people to maintain my self image or to feel good about myself. \n\n \n LMAO, this one perfectly captures it! WE NEED TO COIN A TERM!\n \n \nIt's also quite obvious you TQ, and lyteboy were M.I.A. for that whole debate.\n\n Which forum was in it? If you check my posting history, you would see that I post almost exclusively in the evo/creo forums. So razzing me for not taking part in a debate that I didn't even know existed is just, well, sad Archie.\n \n \nI DECIDE WHEN I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF ANY DEBATE I PARTICIPATE IN, NOT YOU OR LYTE.\n \n\n Which is your perogative. I just find it strange that you always seems you've \"HAD ENOUGH\" when someone tries to pin you down and make you answer a question you don't want to answer, or can't readily answer.",

   "You and lyte seem to think you have been made the official debate enders on this forum and anyone who makes their point but refuses to answer to lies and misinformation is somehow running away or conceding some imaginary victory that you hold so dear to in your small lives.\n\n If you'd like to point out any lies or misinformation I've posted, you go right ahead.\n \n \nBut Lyte follows me around like a cowardly troll\n\n No, I don't, but you do make yourself an easy target. I'll deal with the accusation of being \"cowardly\" below, but I'd like to point out that -- out of the two of us -- my posts are not the ones spewing hatred and condemnation for people of opposing viewpoints and threatening dire consequences for those who don't agree with you. You tend to want to do drive-by postings of inflammatory, unfounded lies and then dash off into the wilderness, never to support your vile slander or reprehensible behavior except to baldly insist that you're right, you're done, and you're justified. So, call me a troll all you want, Archie: nobody believes you but you.\n \n \n... claiming victory when he has been on ignore for a month or so now.\n\n Not so much claiming victory as pointing out the shortcomings of your position and the absurdities of your arguments and behavior. The fact that you won't (can't?) identify and explain any mistakes in my critiques and counterarguments doesn't leave the reader with much choice as to whether one of us has \"won.\"\n \n \nOnly a coward would keep shooting darts at someone after every post they write when they know he isn't even reading what is written.\n\n Pretty funny how Archie is so sure about what I'm saying and trying to condemn me for what I'm writing when he's insisting that he doesn't read what I post.\n Also notice that Archie is saying that he has me on ignore, he is not reading my posts, he refuses to reply to me despite my attempts to engage him in conversation about his assertions (and even accuses me of chasing after him) -- and he is calling me a coward.\n This is the level of Archie logic and argumentation that we have come to expect. Is there really any doubt why he won't supply any substantive responses?\n \n \nAs to me running from debates, check the\n\n debate about atheism and morality that you and your buddy ChristAscended tried to start. You pumped up your righteousness your alleged correctness and proceeded to get your XXX beaten with the Truth Stick of No Mercy\u0099. I invited you to respond to my set of questions, and you just disappeared.\n \n \nSo to accuse me of running from you out of fear just shows how delusional you are...\n\n Then how do you explain, Archie, this thread mentioned above? Oh, right, you're ignoring me because I'm kicking your XXX...\n \n \nas I have lyte on ignore because of his dishonest and irrational style of debate and for no other reason.\n\n I once again invite Archie to cite any instance of my dishonesty in my debating with him. He is also welcome to explain any irrationality in my arguments using standard philosophical reasoning.\n \n \nSo I don't run from debates I'm committed to and I have proven that more than any other poster on this forum by taking on all comers in this debate.\n\n But you run from me, Archie. You have me on ignore and you don't reply to my responses to your \"arguments.\"\n \n \nBUT I DECIDE WHEN I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF ANY DEBATE I PARTICIPATE IN, NOT YOU OR LYTE.\n\n We've noticed. And you decide that you've had enough at about the time your XXX gets beaten down mercilessly.",
