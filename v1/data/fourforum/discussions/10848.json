Whether or not it is your opinion does not invalidate it from being the fallacy of the true Scotsman.\n \n \nNo True Scotsman'\n Explanation\n \n The no true scotsman fallacy is a way of reinterpreting evidence in order to prevent the refutation of one's position. Proposed counter-examples to a theory are dismissed as irrelevant solely because they are counter-examples, but purportedly because they are not what the theory is about.\n Example\n \n If Angus, a Glaswegian, who puts sugar on his porridge, is proposed as a counter-example to the claim No Scotsman puts sugar on his porridge, the 'No true Scotsman' fallacy would run as follows:\n \n (1) Angus puts sugar on his porridge.\n (2) No (true) Scotsman puts sugar on his porridge.\n Therefore:\n (3) Angus is not a (true) Scotsman.\n Therefore:\n (4) Angus is not a counter-example to the claim that no Scotsman puts sugar on his porridge.\n \n This fallacy is a form of circular argument, with an existing belief being assumed to be true in order to dismiss any apparent counter-examples to it. The existing belief thus becomes unfalsifiable.\n \n Real-World Examples\n \n An argument similar to this is often arises when people attempt to define religious groups. In some Christian groups, for example, there is an idea that faith is permanent, that once one becomes a Christian one cannot fall away. Apparent counter-examples to this idea, people who appear to have faith believe but subsequently lose it, are written off using the 'No True Scotsman' fallacy: they didn't really have faith, they weren't true Christians. The claim that faith cannot be lost is thus preserved from refutation. Given such an approach, this claim is unfalsifiable, there is no possible refutation of it.\n \n\n \n http://www.logicalfallacies.info/notruescotsman.html\n \n You're guilty. Period.",

   "There's a third option that you people are unable to comprehend TQ, and that is that my statement stands on its own merits and is just beyong your ability to grasp.\n\n This alleged third option is necessarily contradicted by the first. The very meaning of a fallacy shows that a fallacious statement cannot stand on its own merits.\n \n \nWell I'm here to tell you that your way of thinking is twisted and warped and in denial of what is actually true.\n\n Says the person who uses a logical fallacy, has his use of a logical fallacy explained to him, ignores the fact that he's using a fallacy, objects to further explanations of the fallacy, and then says that his fallacious reasoning is sound anyway?\n As if we had any doubt that you have no capability of joining the real world... Now you're telling us that we're in denial. That's hypocrisy. I'd tell you to get real, but you clearly can't. Instead, just get lost. Tom Waits would call you a \"mental midget with the IQ of a fencepost,\" but I have more respect for fenceposts than to make that comparison.",

   "Your benchmark is classic obvious child in that it is based in solid ignorance of what is a christian in any way.\n\n \n I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry. \n \n To rational people, what I posted was a mockery of your argument and an example of the fallacy. It used the same logic your argument used but against you. The fact that you cannot realize this is extremely disturbing. My argument was not to argue that you aren't a true Christian, just that the logic you provided is asinine and fallacious. Your inability to understand this, again as others have cited is disturbing as you appear to have no comprehension skills whatsoever.\n \n It is quite obvious that you do not understand logic, as you cannot understand why your argument is a fallacy.\n \n \nBased on what Jesus said to the pharisees, your opinion holds no weight in reality, but based on how Jesus taught the disciples to live, my statements do stand up to scriptural scrutiny. So your insistence that my previous statement is a true scotsman is based purely in your lack of true understanding of what it means to be a true believer in Christ.\n\n \n 'True Understanding.' Wow you have no problems with fallacies. I bet you cannot even explain the true scotsman fallacy. \n \n \nSo what is important to me is not how you define my statement, because that is just your irrelevant grammatical label. What matters to me is that regarding this debate topic, my statement is accurate and true.\n\n \n Thanks again for proving my point. A fallacy has nothing to do with grammar. Logic and grammar are two different things. Your serious deficiency in comprehension is probably why you keep losing arguments as you simply don't understand what other are stating. \n \n Let's rehash shall we?\n \n 1) Your argument is textbook case of True Scotsman's fallacy\n 2) Your opinions whether it its true or not are irrelevant in it being the fallacy\n 3) You don't understand the fallacy as you took LITERALLY what I obviously meant to be a glib mockery [as even stated in my post it was mockery] of your argument in using the fallacy against you. What is even worse is that I explained why my mockery was a bad argument in that it assumed the benchmark without proving it and you still didn't get it.\n 4) Your constant refusal to accept that it is a fallacy does not make it not a fallacy.",
