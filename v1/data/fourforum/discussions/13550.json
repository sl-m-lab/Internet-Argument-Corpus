One case he talked about was a group challenging the gun ban in Chicago that has so many restrictions it makes it nearly impossible for law-abiding people to own or possess guns.\n \n \"The only ones the registration laws affect are the non criminals, which is kind of illogical,\" he said.\n \n Two other courts have upheld the ban. This case is the first to go before the nation's highest court since its historic ruling last yearX that found a gun ban in Washington D.C. was unconstitutional.\n \n The issues are similar but involve state rights mixed with the Second Amendment which gives citizens the right to keep and bear arms.\n \n Willamowski expects the side opposing the gun ban will argue those seeking to legally have guns are not the ones who get in trouble. Those people also are the ones the gun ban hurts the most since the criminals are going to carry regardless of the law.\n \n \"There will be a lot of Second Amendment folks watching that,\" he said.\n \n Willamowski briefly mentioned other cases such as whether the government has the right to impose a life-in-prison sentence to a juvenile in a case that does not involve a murder.\n",

   "  Safer Streets 101: stopping outlaws and not freedoms. \n The substance of the second amendment isn't in the concept of guns per se, it is in the concept of being the sovereign in America and, as the sovereign, having the legal and moral monopoly on all lethal force here. The key word is sovereignty.\n \n When we think of safer streets, we often make that same mistake in concept (what do you mean we Kemosabe?) Many believe that our major cities' streets are unsafe due to so many guns on the street, but there are just as many guns on the streets in right-to-carry states without the high crime rate. What gives? What is the subject of gun control missing here?\n \n The answer is that it is not that major cities have too many guns, the major cities have too many Outlaws. Major cities in RTC states have fewer outlaws because they have more guns, not fewer guns. The real difference is not measured in guns, but in fewer laws. That is to say, less gun control becomes more crime control.\n\n Gun control is NOT crime control!",

The first passed as a knee jerk to public assasinations of MLK and the Kennedys but was titled the \"safe streets and safety act\" of 1968. I was still happily carrying my gun aboard planes, trains and busses then. I would wager that those who never knew any different, like you, wouldn't be aware of what free exercise of a right even amounts to? Depends on what you were raised on I reckon. Folks like you still hammer away like there is some magic 'gun control' that will affect the criminal and not the other citizens of this Republic...it will not!\n \n This was written by a law professor at UCLA dealing with 'free speech' which is the same as any other right that calls for free exercise and you could put guns in place of speech and he has and will continue to do so. He writes: The failure to stand up for free expression emboldens those who would attack and undermine it. It is time for colleges and universities in particular to exercise moral and intellectual leadership. It is incumbent on those responsible for the education of the next generation of leaders to stand up for certain basic principles: that the free exchange of ideas is essential to liberal democracy; that each person is entitled to hold and express his or her own views without fear of bodily harm; and that the suppression of ideas is a form of repression used by authoritarian regimes around the world to control and dehumanize their citizens and squelch opposition. - Prof. Eugene Volokh\n \n To paraphrase Ben Franklin, those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety, will get neither liberty nor safety.\n \n You just can't be a little big pregnant Ethmi. :) Some young folks never have known freedom of rights and it is a shame you are so willing to not listen to Ben and Eugene.\n \n I don't know how you are keeping score on top there but it was screwed up before anyone but you posted.

You're a more sophisticated form of a troll.\n \n \nThe title is \"How much gun control should there be?\" I know it's the State that must deem you mentally ill with respect to denying you rights. \n That's the government. The very entity you insist has no right to deny you rights without due process, without proof. \n What constitutes proof of mental illness in this case? We all know what constitutes being a convicted felon.\n\n \n Damn right, it's \"How much gun control should there be\", not \"Which policies are pro-gun or anti-gun\". It's trivial and besides the point.\n \n You could accurately be called anti-gun. You never called yourself an anti-gunner, you've always defined yourself as just \"a person with no use for guns\", not an anti-gunner. Yet you always manage to find yourself debating against the pro-gunners of these forums.",

Walk into a store and buy it,do a straw purchase, gun show loophole or out right break in and steal it. \n \n emoticon_wow",
