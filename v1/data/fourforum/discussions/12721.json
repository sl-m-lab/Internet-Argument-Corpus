   "The American isn't the issue in this story. It is painfully obvious it could have been anyone who went to her house that provided the excuse to arrest her. It is the threat she poses to the Junta and the fact that this illegal government will do anything to keep her from opposing them since she has overwhelming support from the public. Here's what the article says about it.\n She is to face trial on Monday, and until then will remain in detention in Insein prison in Yangon, Myanmar&#8217;s capital, along with two companions who live in her house. The verdict, which might as well come before the trial, will be guilty, and the sentence is likely to be between three and five years in jail.\n \n The junta&#8217;s immediate aim is presumably to keep Miss Suu Kyi under lock and key until after it has staged an &#8220;election&#8221; next year. This will be the first since one in 1990, which, to their horror and astonishment, Miss Suu Kyi&#8217;s National League for Democracy (NLD) won in a landslide. This time, a constitution has been rigged in advance to ensure the army&#8217;s continued dominance of politics.\n \n Since 1990 the NLD&#8217;s leadership and organisation has been harassed into tatters. Yet Miss Suu Kyi herself is still capable of scaring the junta. She remains popular because of her ancestry, as the daughter of Myanmar&#8217;s independence hero, because of her self-sacrifice and because years of systematic repression have eliminated almost every other source of opposition to a deeply unpopular government. The generals have reason to worry about what might happen if she is allowed out on to the streets.\n \n Foreign opinion will be outraged by the farcical legal case, but impotent. Miss Suu Kyi has been in different forms of detention for almost all the past 20 years. Winning the Nobel peace prize and the support of many of the world&#8217;s leading political and religious figures has done little to help her.\n The real question is, why would you make this about the american and not the illegal military government?",

   "I am actually in agreement with Archangel that the regime would have come up with an excuse to continue to keep her under wraps, one way or another, whether or not the American had shown up. He was simply a convenient excuse and scapegoat. Your own article says:\n \nTo most observers there never seemed any doubt that, when the current term of house arrest endured by the opposition leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, came to an end later this month, the generals would extend it. However, they seem to have been bothered about possible reaction to this, and to have wanted a pretext. They have come up with one so preposterous they might have been better off simply issuing a decree.\n\n \n She is a noble but tragic figure that, unfortunately, doesn't look like she will ever be able to gain any real political freedom for her people, given the governments stranglehold on the country. The Junta are limited in what they can do to her because of her fame so she is unlikely to silently \"disappear\" but they have shown that they can keep her under wraps through these house arrests and, now, prison terms. Did you really seriously think that she would just be allowed to go free after her house arrest if the American hadn't shown up? That strikes me as rather naive.\n \n She has been in various forms of arrest since 1989. From Wikipedia:\n \nPeriods under detention[*]Arrested, 20 July 1989, Placed her under house arrest in Yangon under martial law that allows for detention without charge or trial for three years[46] [*]Released, 10 July 1995, Released from house arrest. [*]Arrested, 23 September 2000, Aung San Suu Kyi is placed under house arrest. [*]Released, 6 May 2002, Freed after 19 months of house arrest. [*]Arrested. 30 May 2003, Following the Depayin massacre she was held in secret detention for over 3 months before being returned to house arrest. [*]25 May 2007, house arrest extended by one year. [*]24 October 2007, reaches 12 years under house arrest, solidarity protests held at 12 cities around the world Burma Campaign UK. [*]27 May 2008, Myanmar's military junta extended her house arrest another year.\n\n We will soon find out whether or not this current episode will really lead to a few year jail term or simply another extension of her house arrest. It probably depends on the amount of international and internal protest that it generates.",

Smith wants to accuse Americans of being ugly with this inane thread, but can't see how ugly this thread makes him look for blaming this American for this woman's incarceration, when it is the criminal military junta which is persecuting her for the most ludicrous and illogical of reasons.

Everyone except penfold who has responded to this thread has called him on the ridiculous premise he is endorsing here, and still he defends it.

   "And here's more on this sad case of persecution and this so called \"ugly american\" according to our resident hate monger from Australia. This is just an excerpt from the article.\n \n The Trial of Aung San Suu KyiAfter spending 14 of the past 19 years under house arrest, Aung San Suu Kyi, Burma's ailing pro-democracy opposition leader, now sits in the military junta's Insein prison, notorious for its filth, disease, and the mental and physical torture deployed against its prisoners. She faces a five-year prison sentence if convicted of breaching the terms of her house arrest because a stranger swam across a lake and broke into her dilapidated home.\n \n The new charge is a sign of how seriously the junta takes the threat to its power posed by Ms. Suu Kyi's peaceful activism. Her detention without charge or trial for being a \"threat to the sovereignty and security of the State\" was scheduled to reach what the junta had described as its maximum length on May 27. But the junta needed a pretext to keep her under lock and key during next year's so-called elections, and bizarre events provided one.\n \n So in her trial it won't matter that the junta has exclusive responsibility to provide security at her residence. Nor will it make a difference that she did not know or invite into her home American John Yettaw, described by people who know him as eccentric but peaceloving, who allegedly wanted to talk to Ms. Suu Kyi as part of his research on forgiveness and resilience.\n \n That the detention she supposedly violated has been repeatedly recognized by the United Nations as unlawful under both international and Burmese law won't affect the outcome either. To compound the injustice, the junta has also charged the mother and daughter who live with Ms. Suu Kyi and her physician with various offenses that could land them in prison for years.The Trial of Aung San Suu Kyi - WSJ.com",

   "Well 'symbiote\", why don't you tell Aung San Suu Kyi's lawyer the \"kittens\" analogy?\n \n \n \"Kafka could not have scripted it better. Burma's iconic opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi was due for release from almost two decades of on-off detention on 27 May. With elections scheduled for next year, her National League for Democracy would - in the unlikely event of free and fair voting - win handsomely, just as it did in 1990. That result landed Aung San her incarceration, once the military junta overturned it. Would the junta have the nerve to do the same again next year?\n \n Maybe it will not have to, now that it has found a pretext for stopping her participation. On 3 May, an American by the name of John Yettaw swam across the lake alongside which the NLD leader's Rangoon home sits, stayed two nights before swimming back across from whence he came, and was then detained by police.\n \n Under Burma's Orwellian regime, all house guests who are not relatives must be registered with the authorities. Foreigners are banned from staying in the homes of local people. The regime now can charge Suu Kyi with violating the terms of her house arrest.\n \n It remains unclear why Yettaw visited Suu Kyi, with her lawyer describing him as \"that wretched American\" in media reports, insisting that his visit was unsolicited, and that he was asked to leave upon arrival. However, this will likely cut little ice with the Than Shwe regime, which maintains a firm grip on Burma's judiciary, when the case goes to court.... \"\n \n Suu Kyi: Against the Tide / ISN",

   "He knew the consequence of his actions but nevetheless proceeded.\n\n \nIf that American had had any brains it wouldn't have happened. Period\n\n I think that this is your main misunderstanding. When I first heard about this story online, my first impression was one of a mixture of sadness and amusement - sadness that the incident gave the Junta the excuse to arrest her, and amusement that such a blundering fool of a tourist gave them the excuse (and it wouldn't have mattered to me if the tourist had been an American, a Japanese, or a Kenyan). I never once believed, and still don't after having read more details, that he really put any thought into the consequence of his actions. That is one of the traits of those with limited intelligence - they often don't think about the consequences of their actions. I am sure that you can think of many people you know or have come across that fit that profile, as do I. From Archangel's link: \n \nSo in her trial it won't matter that the junta has exclusive responsibility to provide security at her residence. Nor will it make a difference that she did not know or invite into her home American John Yettaw, described by people who know him as eccentric but peaceloving, who allegedly wanted to talk to Ms. Suu Kyi as part of his research on forgiveness and resilience.\n\n So he is described by people who know him as \"eccentric but peaceloving\" who just wanted to interview her - sounds like a pretty innocent blundering fool to me. Usual countries would see him and his escapade for what it was. \n \n The Junta, of course, were different in that they saw this as an opportunity to further control her. Importantly, they also ignored their own legal grounds to be able to accuse her of taking part since (1) it was the responsibility of the Junta, not Suu Kyi, to provide security for the residence - something that they cannot legally deny, and (2) she did not know or invite him into her home - something that I am sure that they are trying to deny. Even if the American was not a complete fool then he might not have foreseen how much they would have twisted the reality in order to provide an excuse to detain her.\n \n ---On edit---\n Here is a link shedding more light on his character.\n \n From http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8049476.stm : \n \nMs Suu Kyi's lawyer said her supporters were \"very angry with this wretched American\", whom he called \"a fool\". \n ...\n The Thailand-based independent Burmese publication Irrawaddy described Mr Yettaw, based on the views of their \"informed sources\", as \"simply a weird character who acted alone\". \n \n The paper said he appeared to be one of the many \"self-appointed saviours\" in Burma - foreign democracy activists using direct action to achieve political change in the country. \n ...\n Irrawaddy magazine criticised the \"activists, experts, apologists, lobbyists, scholars, opportunists, do-or-die religious zealots and mercenaries\" who have attempted to make a change in Burma on their own. \n \n It says prison sentences for foreign activists are usually short, involving less hardship than those handed to Burmese dissidents. \n \n The \"naive acts cause more harm than good\", it says. \n\n To call an American an \"Ugly American\", you have to show ugly intent. Even her supporters in Burma apparently don't think he did this intentionally. They are simply angry at him for being such a fool - a fool that gave the Junta the excuse to harrass her.",

However, Encarta and Wikipedia in general understand \"Ugly American\" to also include all the rude behaviors listed above. My own experience with hearing that term was in reference to exactly that loud, boorish, arrogant behavior - not to the culturally clueless but otherwise well-behaved Americans. The American who swam to Suu Kyi's compound never gave the impression of being one of those loud, boorish, arrogant Americans. He was simply a naive fool who caused a heapload of problems by his naive actions.\n \n As to the American actions abroad that you mention - in Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan - these often included decision by Americans to push Americanism (be it political, business or cultural practices) on a people where the perceived benefits of that American culture/politics/business were thought of as so superior that the consequences were often ignored as unimportant - the \"We must destroy the village in order to save it\" mentality. As much as I abhore that approach, it rarely was a cut-and-dry issue. In all of these countries, there were large numbers of people that DID support American actions but hoped that we would come in, quickly solve their problems, then leave. Where Vietnam is concerned, I've met people from Thailand that are very grateful that, through our war in Vietnam, we had bought Thailand enough time to properly protect itself from the onset of Communism. This just shows that painting any issue as pure evil or pure good vastly oversimplifies the reality. \n \n Also, though Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan may have been a mixed bag of good and bad results, the American push of their ideals also had quite positive consequences in our involvement in defeating the Nazis and the Japanese in World War II. The advantages for the US in that war compared to more recent wars was that people subjugated by these Axis powers most definitely wanted to be saved by Americans. So, they had won the \"hearts and minds\" by default. Either way, in World War II, American involvement was a clear benefit. Countries that practiced more self-centered \"realpolitik\" might never had involved themselves in others' troubles as the US involved itself in the troubles of Europe and Asia. The bottom line is that the coin of the culturally pushy American has two sides. You cannot only look at the bad while ignoring the good if you don't want to be seen as simply an extremist in your views.",

   "He was an inconsiderate fool indeed.\n You don't provoke a crazy person or give her an excuse to do something evil.\n ...\n The American instead could have known that the Junta would use his trespassing as an excuse to imprison her. How could he know? by looking up the public record of the Junta's actions in the past. He wouldn't have travelled to Burma without knowing the situation there. \n\n Certainly the American COULD have known that the Junta would use his trespassing as an excuse to imprison her but, given the information we have about him, I firmly suspect that he was simply too naive to make that connection. \n \n I keep getting the impression that you think that he knew what the consequences to her would be and didn't care. If so, then I disagree. He comes from a country, the USA, whose authorities generally follow the rule of law. That is what he is used to and all he knows. It takes some level of intelligence to be able to realize that a government might purposely violate the very laws that they set up in order to gain benefit from a situation. He certainly seemed to be aware that he himself might suffer some small reprisal from the government for this act since he had tried it unsuccessfully at an earlier date and since he obviously knew that he couldn't just legally stroll into her compound. However, I suspect that, in his mind, it never occurred to him that SHE could get blamed for his actions and get in trouble for them. After all, nothing happened to her after his earlier unsuccessful attempt and also, if he had looked up the rules of her house arrest, it stipulated that it was the government's responsibility (not hers) to maintain security at the compound and that she would have had to approve of or invite his stay. If you put yourself into the mind of someone who is naive, it is understandable that they might not have realized that the government would distort and violate their own rules and lie about a situation in order to further detain her. \n \nYou don't provoke a crazy person or give her an excuse to do something evil.\n that is why symbiote analogy of the kittens although apparently correct fails the test, if I would have known that she is crazy and had a kitten in her hand, I would have stopped posting. Of course her answer would be : \"how do you know?\" unless proven otherwise my view is: she was of course using a theoretical analogy.\n\n There are at least a couple of versions of this scenario one can think of:\n 1) You know the person is crazy and could indeed kill the kitten if you continue to post. In that case, I agree that, if one is at all responsible, then one stops posting. I don't think this version is true in the case of the American since I highly doubt that he realized to what lengths the Junta would go to distort their own laws and the reality in order to hurt her.\n \n 2) Though she has done some crazy stuff, it never occurred to you that she would kill a kitten if you post since that scenario has never come up before. In that case, I don't think you carry much guilt for posting unless she has killed kittens under such circumstances in the past. You might carry a bit of guilt for not making that extrapolation, but the extrapolation would have been far from certain and it would have required somewhat higher order of intelligence to connect the dots between her ealier behavior and the possibility of her killing kittens. I think this is closer to the American's case.\n \n On a last note, I am quite curious what you personally think was going through his mind when he was planning and executing his trespassing?",

   "Here are a couple more links that shed light on this event and the American's actions:\n From Viewpoint: Why Foreigners Can Make Things Worse for Burma - TIME:\n \n\"I cannot tell you what he was thinking when he made those swims or whether or not he considered the consequences for anyone but himself,\" Yettaw's stepson Paul told the Associated Press. \"I am very sure it never occurred to him that Suu Kyi or her companions could also suffer from his choices.\" \n ...\n It is a remarkable irony that an unknown American, who presumably wanted to champion Suu Kyi's democratic cause, was the catalyst for her latest troubles. But so go the unintended consequences of political inexperience. \"Burma's pro-democracy movement has long been an attraction for fantasists, fanatics and adventure tourists,\" writes Aung Zaw, editor of the respected online news magazine the Irrawaddy, sho covers Burma from neighboring Thailand. \"Did John William Yettaw consider the consequences [of his swim]? Did he think for a minute that he would do more harm than good? Probably not.\" \n \n One of Suu Kyi's lawyers branded Yettaw a \"wretched American.\" Inside the country, it can be easy to spot the foreign idealists masquerading as, say, tourists or teachers, who have made it their mission to change Burma. They whisper about regime change and seethe with political indignation. They talk about signature campaigns or the latest effort to get foreign parliamentarians to condemn the Burmese regime's odious behavior. \n \n The impulse to want to rid Burma of its cruel government is understandable. But, so far, the outcome of this imported idealism has been nothing but failure. \n\n Also, from John Yettaw: Suu Kyi's Unwelcome Visitor - TIME :\n \n\u0095 Claimed he's a student at the Forest Institute, a Missouri school for advanced psychology degrees. The school says he's not currently enrolled. \n \n \u0095 Told relatives he was traveling to Asia to write about people coping with stress and abuse. A Mormon, he reportedly said he planned to write a \"faith-based\" book on heroism. \n \n \u0095Swam across Inya Lake to Suu Kyi's home last year but was blocked from meeting her by her staff. He reportedly left a copy of the Book of Mormon and swam away. After his return to her home on May 3, Suu Kyi reportedly pleaded with him to leave but relented after Yettaw, a diabetic, complained of exhaustion and leg cramps. \n ...\n \"He's a very peaceloving person, well-meaning, forgiving, mild-mannered. He meant the very best for her... I don't think he could have foreseen that it was going to be such a mess, that they were going to make such a huge deal out of it.\"\n -Betty Yettaw, his wife. (AP, May 15, 2009)\n \n \"He gets an idea. He goes and does it and gets in trouble.\"\n -Yvonne Yettaw, his ex-wife. (The Times (London), May 15, 2009)\n\n Look, even the news media was surprised at the extremes of absurdity to which the junta went to in this case in trying to suppress Suu Kyi. If those in the media were surprised, is it really so inconceivable that the naive and not-so-bright American might also not have foreseen these particular consequences of his actions?",

The give-away program was tagged as a solution to the \"inequity\" between those that could afford home loans and those that could not.\n\n As I mentioned before, there are ways to make loans to the poor which are safe. Unfortunately, they are less profitable (ex. one does not automatically raise rates on the first missed payment - payments need to be structured more flexibly) so mortgage brokers don't usually go for them. That is why government pressure helps. Responsible mortgages for the poor need to follow certain rules. As long as those rules are followed, then the mortgage sector can stay safe in lending to the worthy poor. Carter was advocating RESPONSIBLE lending practices to the poor.\n \n It wasn't until this decade that those rules started to be seriously broken with predatory lending practices - including selling mortgages to people who couldn't ever make the payments consistently based on assumptions of growth, etc. If someone makes a rule and then, years down the line, Wall Street starts manipulating things to exploit it, then it is up to the administration that exists those years down the line to recognize the new style of exploitation and alter the rule and regulations to stop that new form of exploitation. \n \n One thing that I have read, though, is that it was politically dangerous to try to change these rules at a time when everyone seemed to be making money - Wall Street, Mortgage Brokers, investors, and homeowners. It takes particularly strong leadership to go against that wave to do what is right.",

   "Ugly Australians:\n \nAustralians are almost a comedy piece. People in Aussie-populated pubs will scream out \"Aussie Aussie Aussie\" just to have a chuckle at the inevitable slurred cries of \"Oi oi oi!\" from the bloke in the Wallabies jersey who would treat it as a sign of disrespect if you didn't answer the call.\n \n Sadly, there's also politics to consider. Australia used to be barely a blip on the world political radar (and mostly still is); however, we're not the innocent, fun-loving little country we used to be (and New Zealand still is - see how easy it could have been?). Like the Yanks, we've dived into an unpopular war, taken powerful sides on a huge world issue, and generally tried to push around a bit of weight that we don't have. You might say politics and travel shouldn't be linked; however, people overseas know what we're up to. It affects all of us.\n \n .... The bottom line, however, is that anyone who's travelled knows there are a lot of Australians out there acting like XXXXXXXXs, and it's giving the rest of us a bad name. I've been to bars in Africa, only to watch a drunk Aussie get thrown out by locals for trying pull his pants down and run around the pool table. At the running of the bulls, I've seen Australians flip cultural respect the bird in favour of running in their favourite AFL jersey, rather than the traditional red and white costume. Once, at a cafe in Munich, a compatriot jokingly tried to draw a large swastika on my arm, seriously missing the hideous insinuation. I've been involved with groups of Australians on organised tours roaming Europe, laying waste to city after city.\n\n The Sydney Morning Herald Blogs: Travel\n \n Oi! Oi!",

It would take far more than eight years under Reagan or anyone else to rebuild what Carter ruined.\n\n The blogs that you quoted were too general and were opinion pieces - not journalistic reporting. Could you quote a main article from a respected journal that actually goes into more detail?\n \nYou're wearing you bias blinders too much. Carter screwed us in more ways than one. I would say that he's been the worst President in recent history, but I think Obama is going to surpass him in that contest.\n\n Carter is the Right Wing's favorite punching bag but one has to face the facts any of the accusations (whether true or untrue) happened THIRTY years ago - more than a generation has passed since. You are far too pessimistic about the agility of the CIA to think that it takes THIRTY years to build a spy ring back up. I have also read that Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries also have trouble setting up spy rings in the terrorist groups and they never faced those cutbacks in spies that you blame Carter for.\n \n ---on edit----\n I realized, on looking back at these posts, that some points may sound contradictory. So, to clarify, I would say that there are various points to be made about spying over the last decades. \n \n 1) I have an acquaintance who is an analyst for the CIA who has noted that most of the time, it is not American spies who infiltrate groups but natives to those groups who get turned and become \"assets\". This has also been supported by the limited reading that I have done on the subject. I cannot say what the structure was before Carter, but I haven't heard (from my acquaintance or otherwise) of any clear disadvantage of spies being comprised of these assets. It is also important to note that a spy ring composed of such assets can be set up fairly quickly - FAR shorter than decades.\n \n 2) Up to Carter's time, the main perceived security threat to the US was the Soviet Block so, from what I have heard, most spies were Cold War spies. Such Cold War spies are much less relevant today, where the perceived threat is mainly from terrorist cells. So, presumably, the main spy network that might have been gutted by Carter (and this gutting has yet to be proven) would have been the Cold War spies. As things stand, any such gutting didn't make much of a difference since we did end up \"winning\" the Cold War or, more accurately, we won it along with the enthusiastic help of those masses on the inside of the Communist regimes that wanted to throw off that burden to rejoin the world.\n \n 3) Terrorist cells are notoriously difficult to infiltrate. Regimes and countries have far larger, more centralized and unified organizations that are easier to inflitrate. As I mentioned earlier, countries such as Saudi Arabia, whose spy networks were never gutted, also have major problems trying to inflitrate the terrorist rings. Either way, Al Qaeda did not exist in Carter's time. We would have had to set up entirely new spy rings to inflitrate them anyway.",

   "Well, the verdicts are in on Aung San Suu Kyi , as well as on John Yettaw. From http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8195830.stm\n \nWorld leaders have reacted with anger and disappointment at the conviction of Burmese pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi for violating security laws.\n \n The UN called for her immediate release after she was sentenced to a further 18 months of house arrest - where she has spent 14 of the past 20 years. \n \n The US, the European Union, Britain and France were among those who condemned the verdict. \n \n However, trading partners China and India have made no public comment. \n \n Ms Suu Kyi was on trial for allowing a US national, John Yettaw, into her lakeside home after he swam there uninvited. John Yettaw was jailed for seven years, including four years of hard labour.\n\n I am not surprised by the verdict against her. This should extend her detention beyond the timeframe of the Burmese election - which the government is worried about. I was somewhat relieved that they decided on house arrest instead of prison but that also is not surprising. It achieves the governments role of keeping her under wraps while minimizing international protest.\n \n As for John Yettaw, he apparently was a bit of a religious nutcase in that his goal in trying to see her was based on a vision he claimed to have had. From Sad tale of John Yettaw : \n \nDuring the trial, it emerged that he had been in contact with exile groups in Thailand before crossing over to Myanmar, prompting the junta to suggest that he was a 'secret agent or her (Suu Kyi's boyfriend).' The exiled activists meanwhile wondered whether he had been paid by Myanmar's government to give a reason for extending her detention, which was due to expire just days after he was arrested.\n \n But it soon turned out that Yettaw believed he was taking orders from the highest authority of all - he had had a divine vision that 'terrorists' would assassinate Suu Kyi and wanted to warn her.\n \n 'Yettaw said he came here because God asked him to,' Nyan Win, one of Suu Kyi's lawyers, quoted him as telling the trial in May. 'In his vision, the terrorists assassinated Aung San Suu Kyi and then they put the blame for the assassination on the government, so that's why he came here, to warn both of them,' he said. -- AFP\n\n This is a case of someone who was well intentioned creating a big mess. I am glad that he was sentenced to time in prison - which could act as a deterent to future fools. However, seven years with four years of hard labor is far too much. I hope he is released much earlier having, hopefully, learned his lesson to think before he acts.",
