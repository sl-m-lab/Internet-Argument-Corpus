   "news.yahoo.com/fc/us/terrorism\n \n Moussaoui Says He Was to Hijack 5th Plane By MATTHEW BARAKAT, Associated Press Writer \n \n \nALEXANDRIA, Va. - Al-Qaida conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui testified Monday that he and would-be shoe bomber Richard Reid were supposed to hijack a fifth airplane on Sept. 11, 2001, and fly it into the White House. \n Moussaoui's testimony on his own behalf stunned the courtroom. His account was in stark contrast to his previous statements in which he said the White House attack was to come later if the United States refused to release an Egyptian sheik imprisoned on separate terrorist convictions.\n \n <snip<\n So, now who is it that could have prevented 9/11? emoticon_confused",

The guy's a looneytoon. We'd be in good shape if he was a typical Al Qaeda operative.",
