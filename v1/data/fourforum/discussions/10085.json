It took about two minutes for someone to call 911, he said.\n \n Calloway, 27, died later at a hospital.\n \n\n (bolding and such is mine)\n \n \nThe district attorney's office will have to decide whether any of the shoppers could be charged, Bassham said.\n \n It was uncertain what law, if any, would be applicable. A state statute for failure to render aid refers only to victims of a car accident.\n \n\n \n \n They certainly deserve to be charged with something - they didn't even call 911 or anything for this woman. As someone who lived for a few months in Sedgwick County (renting), I am sickened at how this woman was treated by these people.\n \n It looks like it is possible that these five will get off without any charges against them, due to the fact that Kansas doesn't have any laws for non-automobile incidents. \n \n \n Thoughts?

   "Whether or not you think these people should be punished for not rendering aid to a woman on the floor is irrelevent until these peoples testimonies can be taken into account.\n \n What I'm wondering throughout all this is where was the manager or person running the store? I'm not sure if she was stabbed in the store or walked into the store for refuge after being stabbed but it seems that someone would notice. Convience stores are usually pretty small, cramped spaces and it would be hard to miss someone being stabbed, with possible screaming and running around etc...\n \n However, my own personal opinion is that these people probably knew something was wrong with her. Whether or not they knew she was stabbed we will have to wait to find out. If they did know she was stabbed and stepped over her/took pictures, it is really very disturbing. BTW, I think it's very rude and disturbing that someone took a picture of this woman whether or not they thought she was drunk or hurt.",

And several people (5) stepping over a victim isn't that many.\n Yes, taking a photo is callous if not done for evidentary purposes.\n \n \n All this chalks up my assertation that the planet is over crowded (a comparison study to how mice behave in over crowding conditions is similar).\n \n I recently discussed the issue to the wife, noting her callousness in some situations. A day afterwards, a young couple in front of our hose (not me this time) had a spat and the woman got out of the jeep and started walking off. Neigher the wife nor I saw this event but our son did.\n With out asking for any details, the wife walked after the female to see if she was okay.\n I asked the son, who informed me that it was the female who was at fault, driving the jeep irratically.\n Just another case of baisness on behalf of the wife for me. But, the truth is this sort of biasness is indemic. As is callousness to the suffering of others.\n \n I'm happy for it.\n \n I'm also reminded of a motorcycle acident I drove by once a block from my desitnation. Turned out a RN was present but refused to render aid...no proper equipment for avoiding the transmission of HIV/AIDS if the victim was positive.\n \n How many people here have been warned about rendering improper aid? Not moving a victim unless you have no choice? \n Should they have informed someone of the victim?\n Sure!\n Should they not have taken a photo?\n Well, what are they to post on their Myspace.com sites?",

   "I know quite well what a stabbing may look like - a personal friend of mine was stabbed in a robbery attempt of myself and him, and I can't express how much blood there was (and he lived through it).\n\n Yes, they can be quite bloody. I have seen entire kitchen floors of about 10x10 rooms covered in coat of blood that made it look like someone painted it on the floor. But again, as I said, there can be little to no blood externally at all as well. One stabbing does not make you \"experienced\".\n \n \n \nHave you been to Sedgwick county? As I stated in the first part, I personally lived there, and YES, it WOULD be unusual, especially in a place like a convenience store.\n\n It's Wichita, not Mayberry. Violent crimes can and do happen there. And I know for a fact that Wichita has a rather sizeable homeless and indigent population. So what exactly would be unusual, someone stabbed, or someone lying on the floor of a convenience store? In a city of ~350,000 and a metropolitan area of about 600,000, I don't have too hard of a time believing that in some parts of town this could be normal. Wichita does have it's share of ghetto. NE Wichita is a violent place.\n \n \n \n Yes, I don't know every fact. What I do know however, is that they have a VIDEOTAPE that shows people stepping over this woman. You really expect me to believe that one of them just up and took a picture of someone lying on the ground? :xbanghead\n\n Again, have you seen this video? Do you have a link to it? \n \n Again, do you know if these people knew that she was stabbed, or could they have possibly thought that she was some crackhead just passed out on the floor. If and when you can speak intelligently about what each of these 5 people knew and were thinking, your opinion about what should happen to them means very little. \n \n And while we are at it, what exactly should these people have done? Lie down on the floor with her and sing Kum-by-yah with her? Place their ungloved hands over her wound? Emergency surgery? These are bystanders, not to be confused with emergency responders. As far as I am concerned, they have no obligation to do anything. 911 was called within 2 minutes, which is pretty quick. But like I was saying, provide me with the evidence that any of these people even knew that she was stabbed, and then we can talk about callous indifference. \n \n \n \nYes, SOMEONE did - not the five who stepped over her and took pictures of her.\n\n Of all the articles I've seen on this case, I have yet to see who actually called 911. But maybe the 5 who stepped over the victim didn't know that she had been stabbed, and therefore did not think there was a need to call 911. I have stepped over drunks, crackheads and bums in the past, and unless I noticed blood coming from them I would probably not think about calling 911 at all. \n \n \n \nWow, I thought I've seen some wierd people in the world, but you just top it all. You actually take pictures of people passed out? That's the strangest thing I've heard of - as well as the most disturbing.\n\n It's a social curiosity. I find it interesting that I can find a homeless man curled up under a newspaper beside the steps to a private club where people smoke $50 cigars and drink $200 a bottle brandy. I find it curious that someone can lie down on the nasty dirty floor of a subway car and pass out with a bottle of Wild Irish Rose in their hand, apparently without shame. I have to marvel at the sight of a homeless person bathing or washing their clothes in the public fountain. I find it extremely fascinating that someone can fall asleep on a ledge or wall overlooking a 40 foot drop, especially when I have seen and taken care of people who have gone \"splat\" at the bottom. You may find it wierd; strange; or disturbing, but I see these things as a reality of the life and times in which I live. Like it or not, right or wrong, good or bad, this is the sad reality of our society...and I see no reason why it cannot be documented.",

For years I was in wicita at least 3 days a week on business. As far as I can ascertain, the victim was covered in blood and laying in a puddle of it...it was very obvious that something was seriously wrong. Apparently the clerk and most of the bystanders believed she had been shot. \n \n That said, it appears that it was not quite what the article claims and the video, which lacked audio, failed to accuratly represent part of what was going on. Apparently the clerk saw her fall but remained behind the counter and counted on a customer to relay information to him. It took him a little time to determine that she was seriously injured. That was apparently the 2 minute delay in calling the ambulance. \n \n Apparently, though, a number of patrons DID simply ignore her and step over her. Some of them DID discuss the matter with the clerk who told them that an ambulance was on the way.\n \n I have been to a lot of auto accidents, and even a couple of shootings (as I am sure you have as a paramedic) where somebody is gravely injured and everybody just kind of mills around. I don't think that it is because they don't care, I think it is because they don't know what to do. You look down and see somebody with a part of their steering wheel sticking out of their chest, or a bullet in the neck, and suddenly the first aid classes you took at the red cross 15 years ago look woefully inadequate. That is just so far outside of the experience of your average person that they don't know what to do, so they do nothing.\n \n At the same time, I think that people have been conditioned to do nothing. How many times have you heard \"do not move an injured person because it can do more harm\" or \"don't try to treat an injured person unless you know what you are doing\". We tell people this because in general, it is a BAD idea to move an injured person unless you are able to either correctly ascertain the extend of their injury or take precautions. Very few people carry a backboard with them. Unfortunatly drilling this #### into peoples heads as simplistic rules sometimes leads to problems. I once pulled up to an auto accident where 4 people stood by and watched a woman burn to death in her car because they were afraid that if they moved her they might cause internal injury. \n \n It is easy to go \"those people are dumber than dogshit\" but at the same time, that is basically what your average joe has been trained to do...call for help then stand by and do nothing. \n \n \nIt's Wichita, not Mayberry.

It is pretty unusual to see homeless people in wichita because either they stay out of sight and out of mind or the police \"handle\" them. In all the time I spent in wichita I never once saw somebody passed out or sleeping in public. \n \n \nAnd while we are at it, what exactly should these people have done?

They feel like somebody should have DONE something. They want to see somebody heroically providing life saving first aid. Unfortunatly most people have NO IDEA how to provide such life saving first aid. If this had happened at a convention of trauma specialists, I could see the outrage. This was a convenience store, not an emergency room. Personally, I carry a grade A trauma kit in each of my vehicles. I got trauma training in the military (and a fair amount of hands on) and volunteer on the local fire department, including on the ambulance (EMT...small department). I like to think that in a similar situation there would be something I could do...sometimes there is not, though. I will tell you that without a pair of gloves, there is no way in hell I am putting my hands on some blood soaked crack head. It just isn't going to happen. I don't care how badly they are hurt. You have to use judgement when it comes to things like that. I have done chest compressions on an 82 yr old man who had recently had bypass surgery without gloves. His stitches burst and I had blood all over my hands. I figure an 82 yr old man who has obviousy just dropped dead of a heart attack is a pretty good risk (stil went in for a full blood panel after that). Some 27 yr old woman who has been stabbed at a convenience store...NOT a good risk.",

Too few details to go on to make these people out to be completely careless and callous yet (aside from the photo). The act of stepping over a person on the floor to me is not that big of a deal. Perhaps SP thinks people should have just stayed in the back of the store, or tripped over the victim without making an effort to step over her?

But the problem is people who think they are helping are often screwing things up. Not to mention the lack of personal protective equipment that exposes them to infectious disease.

McCormick said Williams then unloaded on him about the shoppers in the stabbing case.\n\n \n So, some idiot called the paper because he was upset that they do not send unarmed rescue workers into hot crime scenes. The reporter called the police chief and tried to make a story out of it, and the police chief shot his mouth off inappropriatly. Then rather than admit that his comments were poorly considered, the police department closed ranks around one of their own (in this case the guy who signs their checks) and let this get blown all out of proportion. \n \n For whatever reason, this seems to pop up every once in a while. People get upset that paramedics and firefighters wait for the police to deal with whatever homocidal maniac happens to be around before they rush in. \n \n IMO, this is why details are so thin. Botht he Wichita reporter who wrote teh story and the police department know full well that this is a non-story. By reproting jsut the barest of facts they leave a lot of room for speculation and public outrage.",

Dad was pretty much the same way. He always said that emergency response time for an accident or medical emergency in our town was under 3 minutes for a first responder to be on scene whether it was a cop, paramedic, firefighter, whatever. Most of the cops in town were not EMTs, but had extensive first aid training (the cops were usually there first). I can see his point...and yours. If you live somewhere with a decent response time, why ruin your day?? \n \n I live in a rural area. Some of our response times are more like 20 or 30 minutes before ANYBODY is there. I stopped at a wreck (dual fatality) on the first of the month and it was 15 minutes before the cops managed to get there and 25 before they got an ambulance on scene. I called for life flight when I first got there because one of the fatalities was not a statistic yet and life flight actually beat the ambulance there. \n \n \nI wish we had the same kind of cops around here.

On the one hand, it seems like homeless folks have enough to worry about without the cops constantly adding to their woes. On the other hand, somebody has to keep the crack whores under control and the drunks from peeing on the children. \n \n \nThere are parts of town around here that I will not even go to medical calls in without the police with me.

You are a paramedic, not a combat medic. If you get killed, then whoever needed your help is not going to get it anyway because you will be DEAD. This is not a difficult concept. Every few years, though, it seems like there is a public outcry over the idea that the police should secure a scene before unarmed rescue workers go to work. \n \n \nAs for big Chief Talksalot, he should have known better.

Any other questions?\" \n \n If people are too dumb to understand why an unarmed paramedic or firefighter does not want to be the first responder to roll onto a shooting scene, then I don't feel the need to waste my breath explaining it to them. I have inadvertantly rolled onto a couple of shootings simply by turning a corner as someone was being shot or immediately after they were shot. Not the warm fuzzy feeling I look for in my night.\n\n \n Never underestimate the stupidity or the sense of entitlement of the american public. Those are TAXPAYERS you are talking about. They don't care how many people get killed while trying to help them as long as they get the assisitance they need in a timely manner and are not billed for it later because while a million dollar hospital bill is completely reasonable, if you bill their insurance comapny $150 for the ambulance response, THAT is outrageous. I think that as far as your average taxpayer is concerned if they have to send human waves of firefighters and EMS personnel to be gunned down to save them (or their pet) that is OK. \n \n Look at it this way....\n \n We are constantly told that firefighters, paramedics, and police officers are americas heros. Everybody knows that nothing is more heroic than dying horribly while attempting to help others. You might even get a medal (posthumous of course). It is not that taxpayers are greedy pricks with a massively overinflated sense of entitlement....they are just trying to help you be as heroic as possible.",

You might even get a medal (posthumous of course). It is not that taxpayers are greedy pricks with a massively overinflated sense of entitlement....they are just trying to help you be as heroic as possible.\n\n \n So I was bored at work tonight, and ran across this post again. I had a thought I figured I would share. You and I seem to be on the same wavelength regarding this concept, but I thought I might share my point of view for anyone else who might be interested. Please bear in mind that these are simply my personal opinions, and that they are the personal opinions of someone who works full time as a paramedic in a busy and violent area with many years of experience. \n \n I don't work as a paramedic to be a hero. I don't consider myself a hero. I don't want medals or ribbons or citations or recognition for what I do. \n \n Paramedics, firefighters, and cops accept a certain amount of risk every day when they go to work. It is what we do. We are trained to do it. We get paid to do it. We like doing it. I enjoy my job. It is challenging at times, it is mentally demanding at times, it is personally rewarding at times, it is frustrating and a downright drag sometimes, but these things all make it worthwhile to me. I enjoy mopping up society. I like sticking big needles and tubes into people and giving them often dangerous and mind-altering drugs. Who wouldn't? \n \n Hero is a word that gets tossed around far too often in this day in age. My job is to minimize the chances of me and my partner dying at work. People seem to think that dying while trying to save someone is a heroic act. I vehemently disagree. If I die in the process of trying to save a life, chances are I was doing something I should not have been doing, or was somewhere I should not have been. Jumping into swirling water to save a drowning man might seem heroic to the public, but often simply creates 2 dead people. I'm sorry if it sounds callous, but dying is not a heroic act. Again my job brings a certain amount of risk to the table, and I understand that sometimes there are situations that are beyond my control, but taking the extra chance of dying to save someone is not a good decision in my book. I expose myself to risk because it is my job to do so, not because I want to be a hero to some stranger. I certainly don't want to be a hero to 300+ million American taxpayers. \n \n There is only one person in this world who I want to be a hero to...my little girl. I get to be her hero by taking her to the park, or helping her with her math homework, or being there for her when she needs a shoulder to cry on or some fatherly advise. I do not get to be my daughters hero by jumping into a dangerous situation to save a stranger and dying in the process. I simply get dead. \n \n I agree their are situations in which someone can be labeled a hero. Most often, they do not seek or want such a label. They were simply doing what they thought was right, or what they were trained to do. \n \n In most of the cases I have seen where they call someone a hero, especially the ones where we call a dead guy the hero, I see it a little different. Most people want to jump up and publically anounce what the brave hero did, and how he should be recognized for his selfless act. My comment is usually something to the effect of: \"Great work, dumb as hell, but great work\". If someone wants to be recognized for being dumb, step on up and get your award. Rest assured, I do not seek the company of heros at work. Heros will get you killed.",
