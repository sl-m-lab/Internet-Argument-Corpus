   "Man jailed for going undercover to arrest neighbor\n \n A man claiming to be an undercover agent hauled in a handcuffed neighbor for booking - but ended up facing charges of his own.\n \n Reginald Suggs was charged Sunday with kidnapping, aggravated assault and possession of a concealed weapon. He was in jail Monday with bond set at $15,000.\n \n Wilbur Grady said Suggs, 49, approached him Sunday and told him he was under arrest. He brandished a wooden stick and a .25-caliber semiautomatic handgun, according to police reports. Grady said he recognized Suggs, who lives a few doors down on the same street.\n \n \"I was just in the yard washing the tires when this dude walked up in my yard and said he was an undercover agent,\" Grady said. \"He told me I was under arrest. I told him to get out of my yard with that crazy talk.\"\n \n The two exchanged words before Suggs rushed up and cuffed Grady's hands behind his back. Suggs then forced Grady, 68, into Suggs' car and drove him to the county jail. He told a magistrate that he had brought in a prisoner for possession of stolen property, selling illegal lottery tickets and selling alcohol without a permit.\n \n \"It was the darndest thing,\" said Joe Grady, a 12-year veteran in the Lenoir County Magistrate's office who quickly realized Suggs didn't have the authority to make arrests. \"I've never seen anything like that before.\"\n \n\n \n What happened to the ability to citizen's arrest? Is this right?",

   "i dont get it, did this bloke commit a crime, or did suggs arrest him for nothing?\n \n if suggs actauly witnessed a crime and didnt have time to call the police then he was justified in making a citizens arrest.\n \n but if suggs only suspected the other man of committing a crime, then no, he has no right to arrest him. If that was the case anybody can arrest anybody on mere suspicion,\n \n i could arrest you on suspicion that you could be a terrorist. You wouldnt like that would you. i could point a gun to your head, say to you \"im arresting you because i think you might be an arab terrorist\", cuff you, put you in the back of my car, and deliver you bruised and battered to my local police station, where i would be greeted with a handshake. And if you were not a terrorist, i would just apologise for kidnapping, gagging, and beating you. if that were to happen would you accept my apology, or would you want me arrested and charged?",
