   "There are two alarming factors shielded from the general public and in exercises like the link. Debt service on the national debt, which has passed $7 trillion, is allocated into the various government agencies and departments where the debt was originally incurred. While it's easy to arbitrarily increase defense by say 3% for public consumption, the majority of our national debt (80%) was incurred by and supposedly allocated to the DoD. For 2005, the DoD budget (this includes various departments such as nuclear arms maintenance and others budgeted elsewhere for public consumption and money for Iraq to be funded after the 2004 elections) is:\n \n Current military - $536 billion\n Iraq/Afghanistan - 50 billion (ha ha ha)\n Past military - 349 billion\n \n Of the past military expenses, veteran's benefits are $69 billion while interest on the national debt is $180 billion.

We business people would go immediately to jail for such practices. Calculate the percentage of debt service to budget and see how long your business would last. \n \n The other, more dangerous factor is the seemingly bottomless contingency fund.

   "So, you mean it is not all free? What a bummer.\n \n It seems that now the big issue is can it be fixed without some kind of major recession or economic crash. I say no.\n\n \n Tough call. Fixed? No. Our economy is so vast it can absorb a lot of slow deterioration with increased federal spending (as we're presently experiencing) before it starts to disintegrate. Our major current problems are the massive trade imbalance and declining tax revenues. Until China progresses on raising their internal standard of living and eventually creates the world's largest captive consumer market (formerly our turf), IMO most other developed nations will continue to absorb our deficits with credit in the form of our treasury issues. That's basically all that's now keeping us afloat. China's planning has that slotted ($10k average per capita income) after 2010, so we'll be an important market until that takes place. \n \n We're doing so much damage to ourselves in Iraq that I do believe Bin Laden is merely waiting until we default on Iraqi sovereignty to pay us another visit. Even then, the economic reaction will be nothing like 9/11, much like WWII Germany and Japan eventually soldiering on after the initial shock to saturation bombing. Wartime mentality our government is preparing us with to sustain the citizenry in the dumb as dogshit war on terror. \n \n Some say the social security issue with baby boomers preparing to empty the treasury will cause a major crisis, but I'm not so sure that will happen. IMO at a certain point the government will 'buy out' those who have contributed to SS in the form of treasury issues with restrictions on when and how they can be redeemed, tied to age and very polished actuary tables. That doesn't mean the payroll deductions will stop, just that the government will have to find another means to support the 90% of Americans who believe in 401Ks, no personal savings and maximum personal debt. \n \n I think, as usual, natural resources will be the deciding factor of our economic future. World oil production is going to peak sometime between 2010 and 2015, depending on how fast China and the rest of the world moves to alternative fuels. A few years before that actually happens, gasoline (industry will hoard lubrication and other essential byproducts, so that industry won't go away) will become so expensive the lower and what's left of the middle classes will not be able to afford private transportation conversion expense to get to their service jobs at the burger joints and toy stores. Or do much travel by airliner, if more than national carriers and military are left. The government will try, but we all know how effective government is now, much less that far in the future. And we're not real big on public or mass transportation, which takes government sized capital seemingly always being used in big chunks for gunboat diplomacy to protect our special interests. It could get wild. \n \n I am curious to see the economic response to increased interest rates, I understand that each point of increase will eliminate 20% of home buying qualification, and that's now our strongest industry. In business, that's known as a dangerous concentration of sales. \n \n Eventual gentile' socialistic poverty such as the former British Empire through a steady economic decline or chaos?

After all, that's one of their TWO functions according to the Constitution. Where I have a problem is with the social programs that go on into perpetuity.\n When you spend a $Billion on tanks, there's at least a finite end to the spending bill. When you introduce a new Federal social program, it is a new bottomless pit that can be expanded at will and adjusted through COLAs. Just look at the new prescription plan for Whiteheads, oops, sorry \"Seniors\". We still don't know what it'll cost other than <$1 Trillion.

It seems to me that using the program to buy votes is still raiding it.\n \n \n \nEven if you're old now, you're a fool for depending solely on SS. In my family, I can't think of one retired family member that depends on SS to live, but then again, they're mostly Italian immigrants and 1st and 2nd generation Americans on my mother's side who believed very strongly in self-sufficiency and dead on my father's Scottish side before they hit retirement age.\n\n \n This is the way I was raised as well. You provide for yourself and your family, and don't count on anybody else to do it for you. \n \n \nThe rapists, IMO, are the presently retired Seniors who paid diddly squat into the SS and are receiving a windfall with a smile on their faces. And now with the new prescription plan, they should be kissing the current workers' feet instead of continually crying for more. :xcensored\n\n \n The problem is that seniors vote. You cannot get elected if you tick off the seniors. While I would agree that they are getting far more than they should, cutting them off cold is not a good solution. Are you really willing to drive around and see starving old people on the street? \n \n I would definatly agree that a reduction in benifits is in order for these folks, and a gradual fading out of the SS program. \n \n It seems to be more than just a case of seniors voting themselves benifits, though, there seems to also be no small involvement by special interests.\n \n A good friend of mine is a congressional aide. She called the other day and said \"I can't be a republican anymore, I just can't take it\". Apparently she was sitting in on an insiders meeting on the new prescription benifit, and she said that all the major players were there, the democratic leadership, the republican leadership, and representatives form our drug companies. She said there was absolutly no doubt who was in charge in that room, and it was not any of teh politicians. Nothing that was proposed made it onto paper unless it got the nod from the drug comanies representatives.\n \n I think it is funny that we have set up this huge prescription plan that is expected to cost in excess of a trillion dollars, and at the same time we are arguing about whether or not we should allow low cost prescritions to be imported from other countries. \n \n I don;t know how many caught this, but at the same time that the new prescrition plan came online, drug companies raised prices, so our seniors are not saving much on most prescriptions. Instead, teh majority of what the government provides as far as \"savings\" goes end up in the po=clets of the drug companies, and the seniors end up paying roughly the same for their drugs.",

However, I can point out ten couples making well in excess of $200k/yr who have no reserves or retirement planning other than 401k equity investments and carry crippling debt service to every person who has prepared or is preparing for a self-sufficient retirement. Those people, in their 40s and 50s, don't have a prayer of reserving enough to fund a comfortable retirement. And they refuse to lower their standard of living to do so. I'm afraid that's the general public attitude; depending on real estate appreciation or a miracle for retirement purposes.",
