   "I had to look up Pryor, it appears he supported a direct 1st ammendemnt violation because \"his religion told him to\" and supported Moore in defying the orders of the Supreme court. You'd figure if the public knew that a appoitee did such a thing, they would not want their senator to vote for a judge who uses his religious beliefs as rulings rather then the consitution.\n \n ODDLY that didn't make the news.\n \n Owens, the black female judge doesn't have any background reported in the media. Owens apparently disgregarded numerous laws in Texas and litterally made up her own rulings. \n \n As for the ABA deal, any talk by republicans about that is hypocracy as they disregarded it when they filibustered Clinton's judges.",
