Anything besides what is contained in the CNN article?\n \n We Are Family Foundation\n \n Home Page: http://www.wearefamilyfoundation.org/\n About Us: http://www.wearefamilyfoundation.org/About.asp\n \n \nThe We Are Family Project was started in response to the events of September 11th. Legendary songwriter/producer Nile Rodgers and Tommy Boy Music president, Tom Silverman gathered together 200 celebrities on the weekend of September 22, 2001 to re-record Nile's world renown hit song \"We Are Family\" as a beginning toward the healing process.\n \n The recording sessions that weekend proved the song's power to give hope and allow people to feel better through an uplifting beat and message of unity.\n \n The power of \"We Are Family\" continued.\n \n Shortly after the \"adult\" recording, the world of children's television came together for the first time in history and recorded their own version of the song with over 100 beloved characters.\n \n The music video aired simultaneously as a Public Service Announcement on PBS, Nickelodeon and Disney Channel on March 11, 2002 and September 11, 2002 with a unified message; our common humanity and idea of a global family.\n \n Nile had no idea that the hit song he and his late music partner Bernard Edwards wrote for Sister Sledge in 1979 would be a part of history again by helping to bring people together and giving hope that we can live together in a peaceful world.\n \n The We Are Family Foundation is a not-for-profit 501 c 3 corporation formed in July 2002 to continue the work of promoting our common humanity and the vision of a global family through the use of a simple song and message - We Are Family.\n\n \n The lyrics to the song in question:\n \n \n\"We Are Family\"\n \n Ladies and Gentlemen\n \n Yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea \n \n [Verse 1]\n Everyone \n can see us together, \n as we walk on by. \n And we fly \n like birds of a feather\n I won't tell no lie \n All the people around us they say, \n can they be that close\n Just let me state for the record \n Were giving love like a family does\n \n [chorus]\n We are family, (we are family)\n I got all my sisters with me\n We are family \n Get up everybody sing\n We are family (we are family)\n I got all my sisters with me (i got all my sisters with me)\n We are family (we are family) \n Get up everyboby sing \n \n [verse 2]\n Living life is fun \n and we've just begun \n to get our share \n of this worlds delights\n High hopes we have \n for the future \n and our goal's in sight \n no we don't\n Get depressed \n Here's what we call \n the golden rule \n have faith in you \n and the things you do \n and you won't go wrong \n oh no this is a family joint (yea yea).\n \n WE are family (we are family)\n I got all my sister's with me \n We are family (we are family)\n Get up everybody sing (it to me sing it now\n [X2]\n \n Get up everybody (jump)\n Get up get up get up get up get up get up\n \n We are family (we are family)\n I got all my sisters with me (I got all my sisters)\n Get up everybody \n Oh oh oh oh yea\n \n [Chorus x2]\n \n Sing yea\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mission Statement: http://www.wearefamilyfoundation.org/Mission.asp\n \n \n \nWe Are Family Foundation celebrates our common humanity and the vision of a global family by creating and supporting programs that inspire and educate individuals of all ages about diversity, understanding, respect and multiculturalism; and to support those who are victims of intolerance.\n\n \n Tolerance Pledge: http://www.wearefamilyfoundation.org/tolerance_pledge.asp\n \n \nTolerance is a personal decision that comes from a belief that every person is a treasure. I believe that America's diversity is its strength. I also recognize that ignorance, insensitivity and biogotry can turn that diversity into a source of prejudice and discrimination.\n \n To help keep diversity a wellspring of strength and make America a better place for all, I pledge to have respect for people whose abilities, beliefs, culture, race, sexual identity or other characteristics are different from my own.\n\n \n Hmm. Seems rather worthwhile and benign too me, but then, I don't oppose tolerance. I don't see the word \"homosexual\" or \"homosexuality\" mentioned at all. But then again, the two self appointed gods of the \"Christian\" right; Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson, did proclaim that 9/11 was the fault of the homosexuals in America. I certainly fail to see how\n \n \n the show made a nagging point to try and make sure and make everybody feel they should go out of their way to think of homosexuality in the way gay rights people would want them to\n\n \n \n \n From the CNN article:\n \n \n \"A short step beneath the surface reveals that one of the differences being celebrated is homosexuality,\" wrote Ed Vitagliano in an article for the American Family Association.\n\n \n American Family Foundation Home Page: Home Page: http://www.afa.net/\n \n And\n \n \n \"Their inclusion of the reference to 'sexual identity\" within their 'tolerance pledge' is not only unnecessary, but it crosses a moral line,\" James Dobson, founder of Focus on the Family, said in a statement released Thursday.\n\n \n Focus on the Family Home Page: www.family.org\n \n I suppose if someone took \"a short step beneath the surface\" , they could also argue that this pledge:\n \n \nI pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\n\n \n celebrates homosexuality also through the use of the phrase; \"for all\". Makes just as much sense as what they are arguing.\n \n I find it rather ironic that two supposedly \"Christian\" organizations would vilify a call for tolerance while they preach an agenda of intolerance, bigotry and hate.",

But the issue is, what do you mean by \"accept?\" Do you mean 'agree to disagree'? That I can continue feeling that homosexual behavior is wrong but accept you no less? (If that's your view of acceptance, I can do that.) But if you view of acceptance is for people to give up their religious views altogether about what is acceptable behavior and what is not, and basically say \"it's ok to do that\" , then no. I know you probably hate the phrase \"love/accept the sinner, hate the sin,\" but like it or not, it's a valid way of viewing gay people (and people in general).\n \n \nI do not feel that a message of tolerance can be preached without preaching against intolerance toward the most untolerated group around.

The idea states that no matter what you view is of something, whether it be homosexuals or interracial marriage (which some people still call immoral). The idea is to teach tolerence. No one is asking anyone to start accepting things they find immoral. They are asking people to not persecute others for what they may find immoral. They are asking others not to discriminate against others based on what they feel is immoral. \n \n You also seem to have a chip on your shoulder about \"gay pride\". I find that interesting. Why shouldn't someone is happy and proud to be gay, display that in light of the opposition to our lives. People who are opposed to homosexuality are opposed to a big part of my life. The person I love. They are not upset about my career, or where I shop for groceries. They are opposed to one of the biggest things in my life. My relationship. Meaning the person who I have selected to be mt partner in life. How would you feel if you were me. Wouldn't you feel like your life is under attack when the love of your life, that person who makes you happy to be laive is considered immoral by others. You need to sit down and take a long hard look at this before proceeding any further with your misunderstanding about what being gay is about. It is not sex, it is about who I have found to spend my life with. It is who I have found to make me happy and who I can make happy.",

But if you view of acceptance is for people to give up their religious views altogether about what is acceptable behavior and what is not, and basically say \"it's ok to do that\" , then no. I know you probably hate the phrase \"love/accept the sinner, hate the sin,\" but like it or not, it's a valid way of viewing gay people (and people in general).\n\n \n In a sense, tolerance is both of those things. Someone who \"agrees to disagree\" with another but accepts that person no less is more tolerant than someone who does not do this (though I should point out that giving heterosexual couples the benefits of marriage while denying these benefits to same-sex couples indicates a lack of acceptance, not acceptance. Denying rights to those who do not meet one's own opinion of what is the right way to live removes accpetance of that lifestyle from the law.) Someone who changes his or her religious viewpoints to validate this lifestyle could be considered even more tolerant, though I don't think that this much tolerance is necessary to call oneself a good person.\n \n Also, I do agree that it is both valid and morally good to love the sinner, not the sin. I will argue, though, that it is morally wrong to consider something a sin which harms no one and helps many (though I suppose it could be called \"valid\" to do so), even if one's religious belief commands it. Religious beliefs will never be an acceptable excuse to harm people, by denying them rights or otherwise.\n \n \nI think you'd be hardpressed to prove these two assertions. But FWIW, I agree with you that NO one should have violence perpetrated against them. And NO one (gay or anyone else) should be discriminated against in the workplace or in home buying.\n\n \n Would I be hardpressed? I don't have any statistics here, but I have heard these statistics presented to me at some point. But even without statistics at hand, I'm certain you will agree that same-sex relationships are looked down upon by incredibly large numbers of Americans, and it would only make sense for them to be discriminated against more than other groups because of this.\n \n \nYou seem to be implying that people are less tolerant toward gay people than they are people over issues of race. My response to that is, you should try to tell that to the family of the late James Byrd in Texas.\n\n \n This is what I am implying, and I would state it again, even to the family of James Byrd in Texas. I do not doubt that there is racial intolerance in our country; I don't doubt that at all. But I do doubt that more people are racially intolerant than they are intolerant of sexual orientation. When television shows preach racial equality, the community applauds. When television shows preach equality of sexual orientation, many people scoff and speak out. Perhaps this is a better indication of the state of our tolerance than any reasoning I can provide.\n \n I should also mention that just as James Byrd was murdered because of his race, there have been countless people murdered because of their sexual orientation. Those people deserve mention here as well.\n \n \nAnd in many ways, public sentiment IS what determines what tolerance is. But I would definitely agree that we should all be intolerant of violence against any individuals or group of people.\n\n \n Well, you're right; public sentiment does determine what tolerance is, but I don't think it does that in the way you are implying. As the public becomes more tolerant toward a group of people, being \"tolerant\" applies less to people who the community already accepts and more to people who are not accepted. For example, I would probably not be justifed in calling myself a \"preacher of tolerance\" because I speak of equality for people with blonde hair, even though my hair is brown. Society already accepts blonde-haired people as equals; preaching equality toward them means nothing. Only by supporting people who face the most intolerance can I say that I am truly preaching tolerance. If I simply spout out what the community already agrees with, then I'm pandering to the beliefs of society and pointing myself in the direction we are already headed; I'm not addressing the real intolerance.\n \n But you have said that you oppose violence toward any individuals or groups of people. If this is the case; I do not see why you should have any problem with the creators of SpongeBob SquarePants preaching for tolerance. Increasing tolerance of homosexuals and bisexuals will decrease violence against them. I think we can both agree that this is a good thing.",
