   "I find it humbling that we are capable of such a close encounter with the Sun, or will be by 2015 that is. I understand we have heat shield technology to protect the craft, but how do they expose the instruments to do their testing without getting burned up by the extreme temps once they have arrived there? \n \n The questions I have that baffle the mind are, as the bolded shows, how does the probe survive entering the corona, and how will it survive the force of the solar winds and even reach the Sun?\n NASA Plans to Visit the Sun\n \n 06.10.2008 \n \n + Play Audio | + Download Audio | + Email to a friend | + Join mailing list\n \n June 10, 2008: For more than 400 years, astronomers have studied the sun from afar. Now NASA has decided to go there.\n \n \"We are going to visit a living, breathing star for the first time,\" says program scientist Lika Guhathakurta of NASA Headquarters. \"This is an unexplored region of the solar system and the possibilities for discovery are off the charts.\"\n \n Right: An artist's concept of Solar Probe Plus. [more]\n \n The name of the mission is Solar Probe+ (pronounced \"Solar Probe plus\"). It's a heat-resistant spacecraft designed to plunge deep into the sun's atmosphere where it can sample solar wind and magnetism first hand. Launch could happen as early as 2015. By the time the mission ends 7 years later, planners believe Solar Probe+ will solve two great mysteries of astrophysics and make many new discoveries along the way.\n \n The probe is still in its early design phase, called \"pre-phase A\" at NASA headquarters, says Guhathakurta. \"We have a lot of work to do, but it's very exciting.\"\n Johns Hopkins' Applied Physics Lab (APL) will design and build the spacecraft for NASA. APL already has experience sending probes toward the sun. APL's MESSENGER spacecraft completed its first flyby of the planet Mercury in January 2008 and many of the same heat-resistant technologies will fortify Solar Probe+. (Note: The mission is called Solar Probe plus because it builds on an earlier 2005 APL design called Solar Probe.)\n \n At closest approach, Solar Probe+ will be 7 million km or 9 solar radii from the sun. There, the spacecraft's carbon-composite heat shield must withstand temperatures greater than 1400o C and survive blasts of radiation at levels not experienced by any previous spacecraft. Naturally, the probe is solar powered; it will get its electricity from liquid-cooled solar panels that can retract behind the heat-shield when sunlight becomes too intense. From these near distances, the Sun will appear 23 times wider than it does in the skies of Earth.\n \n The two mysteries prompting this mission are the high temperature of the sun's corona and the puzzling acceleration of the solar wind:\n \n Mystery #1-the corona: If you stuck a thermometer in the surface of the sun, it would read about 6000o C. Intuition says the temperature should drop as you back away; instead, it rises. The sun's outer atmosphere, the corona, registers more than a million degrees Celsius, hundreds of times hotter than the star below. This high temperature remains a mystery more than 60 years after it was first measured.\n \n Mystery #2-the solar wind: The sun spews a hot, million mph wind of charged particles throughout the solar system. Planets, comets, asteroids-they all feel it. Curiously, there is no organized wind close to the sun's surface, yet out among the planets there blows a veritable gale. Somewhere in between, some unknown agent gives the solar wind its great velocity. The question is, what?\n \n \"To solve these mysteries, Solar Probe+ will actually enter the corona,\" says Guhathakurta. \"That's where the action is.\"\n \n The payload consists mainly of instruments designed to sense the environment right around the spacecraft-e.g., a magnetometer, a plasma wave sensor, a dust detector, electron and ion analyzers and so on. \"In-situ measurements will tell us what we need to know to unravel the physics of coronal heating and solar wind acceleration,\" she says.\n \n Solar Probe+'s lone remote sensing instrument is the Hemispheric Imager. The \"HI\" for short is a telescope that will make 3D images of the sun's corona similar to medical CAT scans. The technique, called coronal tomography, is a fundamentally new approach to solar imaging and is only possible because the photography is performed from a moving platform close to the sun, flying through coronal clouds and streamers and imaging them as it flies by and through them.\n \n With a likely launch in May 2015, Solar Probe+ will begin its prime mission near the end of Solar Cycle 24 and finish near the predicted maximum of Solar Cycle 25 in 2022. This would allow the spacecraft to sample the corona and solar wind at many different phases of the solar cycle. It also guarantees that Solar Probe+ will experience a good number of solar storms near the end of its mission. While perilous, this is according to plan: Researchers suspect that many of the most dangerous particles produced by solar storms are energized in the corona-just where Solar Probe+ will be. Solar Probe+ may be able to observe the process in action and show researchers how to forecast Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events that threaten the health and safety of astronauts.\n \n Solar Probe+'s repeated plunges into the corona will be accomplished by means of Venus flybys. The spacecraft will swing by Venus seven times in six years to bend the probe's trajectory deeper and deeper into the sun's atmosphere. Bonus: Although Venus is not a primary target of the mission, astronomers may learn new things about the planet when the heavily-instrumented probe swings by.\n \n \"Solar Probe+ is an extraordinary mission of exploration, discovery and deep understanding,\" says Guhathakurta. \"We can't wait to get started.\"\n http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2008/10jun_solarprobe.htm?list1043372",

   "You've expressed confusion about the solar wind before. I think what you don't understand is just how light the particles involved are. The solar wind consists mainly of electrons and protons; things don't get much lighter than that. They might be moving at up to 750 kps, but with such little mass they exert almost no pressure. For example, imagine a stone as far from the sun as the earth is. How small would it have to be such that the pressure from the solar wind balanced the gravitational pull of the sun? Answer: about 2 E -7 m across, so small you couldn't see it. The solar winds exert enough force to push gases around, but will be of no concern when it comes to a space probe approaching the sun; its gravitational pull will be more than sufficient to allow approach.\n \n As for surviving the corona, you musn't confuse temperature with heat. The temperature may be high, but the density of the particles is so low that there is almost no heat. To better understand the difference, imagine someone flinging a single drop of boiling water at you. Now imagine someone throwing a bucket of boiling water at you. Same temperature in each case, but the bucket of water will hurt a lot more. The bucket of water has more mass, so it has a lot more heat, and it's the heat that gets you, that's the real metric for energy transfer.

The solar winds exert enough force to push gases around, but will be of no concern when it comes to a space probe approaching the sun; its gravitational pull will be more than sufficient to allow approach.\n\n \n This isn't so nearly cut and dry though or else NASA wouldn't be planning this mission to answer the second mystery described here:\n Mystery #2-the solar wind: The sun spews a hot, million mph wind of charged particles throughout the solar system. Planets, comets, asteroids-they all feel it. Curiously, there is no organized wind close to the sun's surface, yet out among the planets there blows a veritable gale. Somewhere in between, some unknown agent gives the solar wind its great velocity. The question is, what?\n Are we to infer that these particles weigh nothing and have no density at all? And what about this: \n Fast and slow\n The sun emits radiation, which is pure energy, along with the solar wind, which is fast-moving matter. The wind's particles are accelerated by the sun's magnetic fields, and the configuration of the magnetic fields can influence how fast the solar wind is going when it rushes out into space.\n \n Astronomers recognize two types of solar wind, distinguished by their speed. The fast one is known to originate from coronal hole regions near the sun's poles and travel at about 1.8 million mph. The slow one flows from the equatorial region of the sun at about 432,000 mph to 1.8 million mph.\n \n The fast solar wind is so much faster because the magnetic fields that loop out from the polar regions are always \"open,\" meaning they don't loop back toward the sun's surface. So \"all the gas can keep streaming out, there's nothing to stop it,\" Harra said.http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24014443/\n Now regarding the bolded and the underlined, The sun emits radiation, which is pure energy, along with the solar wind, which is fast-moving matter. The wind's particles are accelerated by the sun's magnetic fields,\n \n If I'm not mistaken, doesn't matter and particles connote weight? And mean that the solar winds have a certain degree of mass which equals force? I have been blown around in Chicago by very high winds from just air so I just imagined that any matter and particles found in solar wind would also generate force. But the one thing you said that made alot of sense that I forgot completely about and wasn't allowing for in my thinking was the gravitational pull of the Sun which is huge. \n \n But that just creates a whole new problem for me in determining how they will prevent the probe from being sucked into the Sun and completely destroyed once it gets within a measly 3 million miles from it? \n \n \nAs for surviving the corona, you musn't confuse temperature with heat. The temperature may be high, but the density of the particles is so low that there is almost no heat. To better understand the difference, imagine someone flinging a single drop of boiling water at you. Now imagine someone throwing a bucket of boiling water at you. Same temperature in each case, but the bucket of water will hurt a lot more.

At 9 solar radii out there's so little matter that heat transfer won't be as high as you seem to think.\n\n \n Here's what the OP say's: At closest approach, Solar Probe+ will be 7 million km or 9 solar radii from the sun. There, the spacecraft's carbon-composite heat shield must withstand temperatures greater than 1400o C and survive blasts of radiation at levels not experienced by any previous spacecraft. Naturally, the probe is solar powered; it will get its electricity from liquid-cooled solar panels that can retract behind the heat-shield when sunlight becomes too intense. From these near distances, the Sun will appear 23 times wider than it does in the skies of Earth.\n \n So the probe will get within a little more than 3 million miles from the Sun with temps of only 2500 degrees fahrenheight. So I agree that's not that bad considering our heat shield technology. That temp just seems incredibly low considering how close it will be at that time. And I understand that solar winds are stronger farther away from the sun and weaker as it gets closer. But is 3 million miles close enough to nullify winds of 1.8 million mph as the link mentions? And if so, then what about the approach as the probe is farther out? On the one hand we have solar winds of 1.8 million mph, and on the other hand we have a gravitational pull of immense strength. It just seems like an incredible accomplishment to me considering how much we still don't know about the Sun. So I thought it was worth sharing.",

   " Are we to infer that these particles weigh nothing and have no density at all?\n\n No, because that would contradict what I said.\n \n \n \n If I'm not mistaken, doesn't matter and particles connote weight? And mean that the solar winds have a certain degree of mass which equals force? \n\n I did say that the particles are light, not massless. The solar winds do exert a force, it's just no where near as large a force as you seem to be imagining.\n \n \n \n But that just creates a whole new problem for me in determining how they will prevent the probe from being sucked into the Sun and completely destroyed once it gets within a measly 3 million miles from it? \n\n Easy, they'll just put it in orbit. Or, alternately, they'll simply let it fall into the sun, collecting and transmitting data all the way down.\n \n \n \n So the probe will get within a little more than 3 million miles from the Sun with temps of only 2500 degrees fahrenheight. \n\n You dropped a zero when you converted. It's 25000 fahrenheit, not 2500. Also, it's more like 4.3 million miles.\n \n \n \n And I understand that solar winds are stronger farther away from the sun and weaker as it gets closer.\n\n No, not quite. There's no organized wind on the surface of the sun. As you move away it quickly picks up speed, and then it becomes weaker as you move even further out. I don't know off hand where the max point is, but it's pretty close to the sun. For most of the solar system the solar wind gets stronger the closer you get to the sun.\n \n \n \n But is 3 million miles close enough to nullify winds of 1.8 million mph as the link mentions?\n\n You gotta get over the speed and try to remember that this \"wind\" isn't comprised of nice dense, heavy air but a very light, whispy plasma. It consists mostly of electrons, they're so light they simply can't hit you very hard no matter how fast they're going. At earth distance from the sun the pressure is about 2 nPa. That's about 2.9 E -13 psi. Yeah, that'll get higher as you get closer to the sun, but it simply isn't that great a force. They don't need to \"overcome\" it, they just need to make minor adjustments to the tragectory to make sure the probe stays on course.\n \n \n It just seems like an incredible accomplishment to me considering how much we still don't know about the Sun. \n\n It really isn't; it's just engineering.

As long as you maintain orbital velocity you'll stay in orbit, regardless of how much gravity there is. The issue with staying in orbit near the sun is that it's spewing out matter all the time, it's atmosphere extends quite a ways.

(in a vacuum, of course) The two factors that govern orbiting velocity are the mass of the main body and the distance from that body you want to orbit. Actually three factors; if you don't assume circular orbit than you need to define the shape of your ellipse. For an elliptical orbit, with the ellipse having semimajor axis a, the main body mass M, and the object having distance r from the main body the equation is:\n \n v^2 = GM( 2/r - 1/a )\n \n where G is the universal gravitational constant.",

If you know the speed in advance, you can stick something in orbit.\n\n \n This discussion just raises more questions than it answers though. For example, you refer to the speed of the satellite as a determining factor for keeping it in an orbit around the Sun as opposed to it being drawn in to it because of its gravitational force.\n \n Look at the planets that orbit our Sun, they are all different sizes and different densities, and they orbit the Sun at different speeds, but there seems to be no mathematical consistency in equating what keeps them in their orbits around the Sun. Especially Pluto which breaks all of the laws of reason by being a dwarf planet due to its tiny size and its incredible distance from the Sun of 3,674.5 million miles and taking 247.7 years to make one revolution around the Sun. It also only takes Pluto 6.39 Earth days to make just one revolution. You would think its small size and tremendous distance from the Sun would cause it to have much much shorter days than we have here on Earth. \n \n Now compare that farthest celestial body in our Solar System from the Sun, to the second nearest one. Venus, which is very close in size to the Earth. Venus is 67.2 million miles from the Sun and takes 224.68 Earth days to make one revolution around the Sun. These figures aren't very incredible at all and make sense considering its size and distance from the Sun. What is incredible though is that it takes 243 Earth days to make one revolution, so one day on Venus is equal to 243 days on Earth. Now, when you consider that these sister Planets density, mass, orbital velocity and gravitational attractions at their surfaces are quite similar, why is Venus The planet with the longest day? A day on Venus is longer than its year; a year on Venus takes only 224.7 Earth days). \n \n The planet with the shortest day is Jupiter; a day on Jupiter only takes 9.8 Earth hours! When you observe Jupiter from Earth, you can see some of its features change. So being the largest Planet seems to have no bearing at all on the length of a day on Jupiter.\n \n Note how uniform the Planets velocities are: http://www.enchantedlearning.com/pgifs/Planetvelocity.GIF\n \n Compared to how erratic the densities are: http://www.enchantedlearning.com/pgifs/Planetdensity.GIF\n \n In relation to gravity on the Planets at the ground: http://www.enchantedlearning.com/pgifs/Planetgravity.GIF\n \n And a Solar day on all of the Planets is equally inconsistent. http://www.enchantedlearning.com/pgifs/Planetaryday.GIF",

   "This discussion just raises more questions than it answers though. For example, you refer to the speed of the satellite as a determining factor for keeping it in an orbit around the Sun as opposed to it being drawn in to it because of its gravitational force.\n \n Look at the planets that orbit our Sun, they are all different sizes and different densities, and they orbit the Sun at different speeds, but there seems to be no mathematical consistency in equating what keeps them in their orbits around the Sun. Especially Pluto which breaks all of the laws of reason by being a dwarf planet due to its tiny size and its incredible distance from the Sun of 3,674.5 million miles and taking 247.7 years to make one revolution around the Sun. It also only takes Pluto 6.39 Earth days to make just one revolution. You would think its small size and tremendous distance from the Sun would cause it to have much much shorter days than we have here on Earth. \n \n Now compare that farthest celestial body in our Solar System from the Sun, to the second nearest one. Venus, which is very close in size to the Earth. Venus is 67.2 million miles from the Sun and takes 224.68 Earth days to make one revolution around the Sun. These figures aren't very incredible at all and make sense considering its size and distance from the Sun.

My question remains, if the bible is nothing more than myths and fables which have no basis at all in truth, then why do they all take such offense when faced with it? \n \n Also charlie, I am the only person on this forum who never gives MY OWN OPINIONS AT ALL REGARDING WHAT IS RIGHT, MORALLY SPEAKING, but I just share the morals and values that the bible proclaims to be true and universally applicable for all of humanity. Yet in most every post it is me who is labeled as a hater and a promoter of dissension around here. And not for even telling my own truth mind you, but for telling the truth as the Bible tells it. The question for me remains, by what authority do atheists and secular humanists demand that their value systems are more credible or valid than those proclaimed in Gods Word by me? And why do they have a right to become indignant and offended, but I'm supposed to just bend over and take their combined abuses on a daily basis? How is that Just or Right in any way? I have much more I could say on this subject, but I'll wait and see if I get any responses to what I have said here. The question is charlie, how will you and the other posters respond to the PMs telling you to freeze me out? Will you allow a gang of defeated secular humanists to dictate who you respond to in debates?\n\n I don't want to pull your post apart, Archie, because it's the wrong thread and well off topic; I don't want to be the arbiter of who's right/wrong said this/that in a debate interchange; but I will agree that ad hominems get flung about, and this can only lower the standard of debate.\n \n No one has PM'd me suggesting I freeze you out. I'll make my own decisions in that regard.\n \n As for the contents of your post above, if we disregard personality clashes and references thereto, you opened up a number of avenues for exploration by debate: e.g.\n \n 1. If the bible is nothing more than myths and fables which have no basis at all in truth, why do some people take offence at its contents?\n \n 2. Is the bible the original source of morals and values applicable to all of humanity?\n \n 3. Should alleged biblical truth go unchallenged?\n \n 4. By what authority do atheists and secular humanists demand that their value systems are more credible or valid than those proclaimed in God's Word?\n \n Perhaps you'd like to start some threads as above, exploring the issues (probably again in some cases), and get everyone's cards on the table. And we'll see in the case of each individual who is the 'bigger man'. emoticon_xhoho",

The fact remains that with posters like Penfold, for just one convenient example, because he can't help but troll the forums, looking for anything I post and then in his typical fashion, posting some ignorant off topic slam just as he did above this post. If someone wants to take a journey into troll land, just read his posts in order and see how high the percentage is that are directed at me or other conservatives like me, just as the one above is. They are off topic and personal insults. For the most part, that is all he contributes to this forum. Here's the link, check it out and see how many out of his last 100 posts contribute nothing at all to the debates but just attack the poster in a condescending way. http://www.4forums.com/political/search.php?do=finduser&u=10012\n \n I attempt to debate issues here for the most part.
