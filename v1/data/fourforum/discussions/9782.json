With the rabid militant style dogmatic approach some take (on both sides) to this topic, a fair compromise would be hard to reach.\n \n One of the issues I seems to dislike is the determinations of 'person-hood' or 'mental existance'.\n I base my beliefs on life, human life. An embryo is a stage of human life, as is a fetus, infant, child, etc.\n If one group places an artificial prerequisit on what's valuable and what's not (as in the philosphy thread) we get many possiblities for abuse. More so when each individual is allowed his own say. \n I just don't want this to turn into a slippery slope later and from history and other somewhat relevant issues (embryonic stem cell research, cloning, organ harvesting) we could easily see abuse. More so as the have vs have-nots gap increases, resources become more limited and people desperate.\n \n I can fully understand the logic and reasoning why some feel the need to get an abortion. I can see why 1st trimester 'lumps of tissue' aren't very appealing or illicit a desire for preservation. I can see where common ground is struck as development is more pronounced (it really isn't a mental issue as opposed to an appearance issue as a 3rd trimester fetus appears more like a living human and the leap in compassion is understandable) when the 3rd trimester approaches. I can also understand grey areas on 2nd trimester pregnancies and abortions.\n \n Seems to me, the more 'human' something appears, the more one is willing to acknowledge it's 'rigth to life'. After that is reached, then mental emotional qutients are checked.\n Nothing more different that the genetic in-built mechanisms of us vs them. \n \n My goal would not be to ban abortion out right but to make it so as getting one is the only viable course of action in preventing physical harm to a mother. Adoption would be willing to take the child off the hands of a mother who doesn't want it, assistance in providing the medical aid needed to give birth is delt with when needed. Society gets to a point where one needn't fear any reprisal for having a child via career oprotunities, education or what have you.\n In most all cases, pregnancy is a temporary situation. I just believe it's odd to take a permanent action like abortion to deal with this 'problem'.\n \n I would also like to ensure that all pertient medical information is presented to the person getting an abortion including benefits and hazards. I would like guardians or parents notified of ANY medical procedure done on a minor (notification is not consent). I would also like to ensure that the patient undergoing the operation is properly cared for. Not churned out and forgotten after the procedure with some form of medical observation or followup. \n \n \n Hope that clarifies some.",

Why they would have to wait till the third trimester in order to determine that she needed an abortion or not in this day and age with the current medical capabilities for real time diagnoses on the unborn was obviously not an issue worth considering for the Justices.

   "As thelmoose mentioned, this ban was against the procedure itself and did not specify a particular gestational period in which it would be banned. This would also concern me. As I mentioned in my first response in this thread, I would support a ban on partial birth abortions if it were limited to the third trimester (or close to it) and allowed for the usual exceptions - including exception to a woman's health.\n \n The fact that the goal is to ban a particular abortion procedure, not specifically to address late term abortions, is troublesome. What specifically are the reasons for banning this procedure? Because it is gruesome? I would think that all methods of killing any living being are gruesome, outside of lethal injection - where any trauma happens quietly without any external signs. If gruesomeness of a procedure is enough to ban it, then that leads to a slippery slope where pro-life supporters might want to ban all abortion procedures because they are considered gruesome. If not for the gruesomeness factor, perhaps pro-life people think it causes too much suffering. My understanding is that the late term fetus is given anesthesia during the procedure so it doesn't feel anything and thus does not suffer it. If I am wrong about this point of anesthesia, please let me know and I will advocate however I can for those few late term abortions (that fall within the exceptions) to be accompanied by such anesthesia. \n \n Again, my main question to those on the pro-life side is why ban this specific procedure? What specifically did you find so bad in it that you want to ban it?",

   "Actually, not all pro-choice speak the same language in the 3rd trimester. With the rabid militant style dogmatic approach some take (on both sides) to this topic, a fair compromise would be hard to reach.\n\n Yes, many on the pro-choice side would want abortion fully legal in all trimesters. From the few I have spoken with on this topic, it seems that the main reason given is a fear of the slippery slope. Others view a woman's right to her own body as paramount over every other consideration.\n \n However, since 84% of Americans think that abortion should be generally outlawed (minus exceptions) in the third trimester, that means that most pro-choice proponents also would generally outlaw third trimester abortions. This is a majority pro-choice view. In general, I would say that there is far more variation in pro-choice views than there are in pro-life views - largely because the \"pro-life\" position is defined by its insistence on the rights of the unborn from conception on. Most of the variations in pro-life views seem to stem from the exceptions that would be granted to abortion restrictions. Ultimately, then, it seems that those on the pro-life side are less open to compromise than those on the pro-choice side.\n \nOne of the issues I seems to dislike is the determinations of 'person-hood' or 'mental existance'.\n I base my beliefs on life, human life. An embryo is a stage of human life, as is a fetus, infant, child, etc.\n If one group places an artificial prerequisit on what's valuable and what's not (as in the philosphy thread) we get many possiblities for abuse. More so when each individual is allowed his own say. I just don't want this to turn into a slippery slope later and from history and other somewhat relevant issues (embryonic stem cell research, cloning, organ harvesting) we could easily see abuse. More so as the have vs have-nots gap increases, resources become more limited and people desperate.\n\n The reason I view mental existence as being critical (and others hold similar views) is that many if not most people have moral approaches that are ultimately based on empathy - that and expectation (taught from childhood) that one should treat others as one would expect oneself to be treated. When one looks at the issue of slavery, genocide, or any other mistreatment of people, it is the emotions and analysis generated by our sense of empathy that generally cause us to view such mistreatments as unjust. Where embryos and early fetuses are concerned, any empathy one would place with them would be based on pure fiction and immagination since, without a mental existence, it is impossible for them to suffer, feel or experience anything. Empathy is irrelevant where embryos and early fetuses are concerned so the moral picture is very different.\n \nI can fully understand the logic and reasoning why some feel the need to get an abortion. I can see why 1st trimester 'lumps of tissue' aren't very appealing or illicit a desire for preservation. I can see where common ground is struck as development is more pronounced (it really isn't a mental issue as opposed to an appearance issue as a 3rd trimester fetus appears more like a living human and the leap in compassion is understandable) when the 3rd trimester approaches. I can also understand grey areas on 2nd trimester pregnancies and abortions.\n \n Seems to me, the more 'human' something appears, the more one is willing to acknowledge it's 'rigth to life'. After that is reached, then mental emotional qutients are checked.\n\n I can imagine that there are many people who do base their abortion views on how much a fetus appears human. However, I have not encountered any such views on this forum. Most people in this forum on the pro-choice side have either argued the necessity of some mental development or argued the case that a woman's right over her body supercedes all. Certainly, I personally view the human appearance of an embryo or fetus as secondary. \n \nMy goal would not be to ban abortion out right but to make it so as getting one is the only viable course of action in preventing physical harm to a mother. Adoption would be willing to take the child off the hands of a mother who doesn't want it, assistance in providing the medical aid needed to give birth is delt with when needed. Society gets to a point where one needn't fear any reprisal for having a child via career oprotunities, education or what have you.\n\n I am glad to hear that you would not ban abortion outright and applaude any efforts on your part to support alternate choices. On that point, what are your views on sex education in school? What about distribution of contraception to teenagers or the needy who might want it? I would think that successful and responsible use of contraception would be the main thing that would limit unwanted pregnancies.\n \nI would also like to ensure that all pertient medical information is presented to the person getting an abortion including benefits and hazards. I would like guardians or parents notified of ANY medical procedure done on a minor (notification is not consent). I would also like to ensure that the patient undergoing the operation is properly cared for. Not churned out and forgotten after the procedure with some form of medical observation or followup. \n\n I also agree that women should be fully informed about their choices before having an abortion performed and would even support some law being introduced that makes sure that women know their options before they decide on abortion. Many women already have made a well informed decision, but others might be making a decision without knowing all the facts and I think a law enforcing that would generally weigh positively. As for notification of parents, I have mixed feelings. Most parents are caring and could be good advisors to their daughters considering abortion. However, there are many abusive parents out there. Some daughters might get back-alley abortions to avoid telling their abusive parents. It would be nice if such a notification law could be introduced which simultaneously protects those women with abusive parents.",

This is the motive that would concern me most.\n \n 2. It is a knee-jerk reaction against a particularly gruesome procedure. Knee jerk in that it is purely based on an emotional reaction and reasonable questions are not asked and addressed (such as whether the fetus is suffering during the procedure and whether there are alternate ways of eleviating that - such as fetal anesthesia). \n \n 3. As Jyoshu suggested, it could be that the pro-life side took advantage of this opportunity because many on the pro-choice side also reacted against this procedure, so this was one area where they thought they could win politically.\n \n This also makes me wonder whether there are second or third trimester abortion procedures that would appear much less gruesome. For example, I can imagine that lethal injection is much more benign but that might be very dangerous for the mother. \n \n Apart from the gruesomeness factor, there is the concern about fetal pain. I would be strongly in favor of administering fetal anesthesia or something of similar function to remove any possible fetal sensation of pain during late term abortion procedures.",

   "Well first, let's remember that SCOTUS was not making a value judgment on abortion--they were ruling on the constitutionality of this particular law. As Justice Kennedy stated, the opponents of the act \"have not demonstrated that the Act would be unconstitutional in a large fraction of relevant cases.\"\n\n So, the constitutionality of an issue depends on the percentage of people whose constitutional rights get violated by a law? What about the constitutional rights of the minority whose health risk would require that particular procedure to be used? I am certainly not an expert in constitutional jurisprudence, but the actions of this version of SCOTUS smacks of the legislating from the bench that Republicans have criticized Democrats for. I think that there is room for interpretation in the Constitution that can swing things one way or the other, but I think that the constitutional rights of ALL people need to be considered when addressing a particular law - not just of the majority. \n \nNow if you want to discuss why that law has support among people, I think the key here is that this procedure is a late-term form of abortion. So it's not just the gruesomeness of it, but the fact it is performed so late in the pregnancy. That is the basis, I believe, that helped more than anything in public support for this law. Does that mean that all late-term abortions should be banned (sans exceptions)? Well, yes I would like to see that happen. As you point out, a lot of pro-choicers might like to see that happen as well.\n\n My understanding (from a pro-life site no less) is that most such procedures are done in the fifth and sixth month of pregnancy - i.e. mostly the second trimester not the third. Since 84% of people support making third trimester abortions generally illegal and 68% of people support making second trimester abortions generally illegal, I can see how a mainly second trimester procedure would have gotten the support of enough people on the pro-choice side to swing the balance. Judging from those poll numbers, the majority of pro-choice supporters, including myself, would keep second trimester abortions generally legal. I, personally, would only support a general ban on this procedure only around the third trimester (or close to that) on and, as we had already discussed, I would include the health exception - which this law does not include.\n \n All that being said, if outlawing late-term abortions was the main goal of the law, why was that not addressed directly? My concern is that this is a somewhat underhanded approach of outlawing a procedure because of nebulous criteria such as gruesomeness, where such nebulous criteria could be applied to other abortion procedures to ultimately get rid of all of them - i.e. the slippery slope.\n \n On a related issue, one criticism of this procedure is that it could be very painful for the fetus being aborted. I had originally thought that any abortions that are performed late enough for the fetus to have developed a sense of pain would be done with fetal anesthesia (or something of similar function) being applied. From google searching, I have discovered that there is no such requirement. Indeed, it is of great concern to me that there could be very late term abortions performed without such fetal anesthesia. There is an Unborn Child Pain Awareness Act (2005 version), that passed the house last December that requires a woman potentially undergoing a late term abortion to be notified about the pain that the fetus might experience and about the fetal anesthesia option. I would go even further to require fetal anesthesia once it is clear that the fetus can feel pain (except when such anesthesia could pose a great risk to the mother). Most medical studies have ascertained that pain cannot be experienced before 26 weeks gestation. Legislation related to fetal pain has only been introduced in the last several years.\n \n Either way, if it is fetal pain in the partial birth abortion procedure that is the main concern - a concern that I would agree with - then that should be addressed directly with legislation. What main objection would be left to the partial birth abortion procedure if it were painless for the fetus?",

Because this was a law already in place, burden of proof fell on those who wanted to do away with the law. And according to SCOTUS they didn't demonstrate unconstitutionality in most cases. I agree with you however, that it sounds like they are basing this on percentages, to some extent. \n \n \nMy understanding (from a pro-life site no less) is that most such procedures are done in the fifth and sixth month of pregnancy - i.e. mostly the second trimester not the third.

In that case perhaps you were right that it was also the gruesomeness of it that resonated with the public, rather than only the idea of a late-term procedure.\n \n \nJudging from those poll numbers, the majority of pro-choice supporters, including myself, would keep second trimester abortions generally legal. I, personally, would only support a general ban on this procedure only around the third trimester (or close to that) on and, as we had already discussed, I would include the health exception - which this law does not include.\n\n \n Just curious, but why do you choose to view allowance for the procedure based on 3rds of the way into the pregnancy? What special thing about \"3rd trimester\" makes it a cut-off point for disapproving of abortion? \n \n I think more and more people are getting to where point-of-viability-outside-the-womb has as lot to do with their thinking on this, more so than thinking in terms of trimesters. Technology has advanced significantly since Roe, to where viability outside the womb is as early as 22 weeks, which is in the 2nd trimester. There is every reason to believe the age of viability will continue to move backward into the pregnancy as technology continues to advance.\n \n \nAll that being said, if outlawing late-term abortions was the main goal of the law, why was that not addressed directly?\n\n \n Anything like this is going to be piece mill--I think pro-lifers are simply taking what they can get.\n \n \nOn a related issue, one criticism of this procedure is that it could be very painful for the fetus being aborted.

From google searching, I have discovered that there is no such requirement. Indeed, it is of great concern to me that there could be very late term abortions performed without such fetal anesthesia. \n\n \n This is one of the arguments pro-lifers have used for years. I think it's important for pro-choicers to know about what you just mentioned, because I think part of what makes abortion defended in this country is that there are many people who take a stand-off clinical view of it; that it's just a procedure. But we know it's a procedure that causes pain and suffering for the fetus.\n \n \nEither way, if it is fetal pain in the partial birth abortion procedure that is the main concern - a concern that I would agree with - then that should be addressed directly with legislation. What main objection would be left to the partial birth abortion procedure if it were painless for the fetus?\n\n \n This would be a band-aid on the real problem that doesn't get rid of the source of pain.\n \n Another problem (and reason I think this procedure is so hated) is that it really does involve partial delivery of the fetus. So no longer are you killing a fetus in the womb; a partially-delivered baby is being killed. Proponents of the procedure hate the phrase \"partial birth abortion\", but in fact that's what it is. The fetus is partially delivered before it is killed. So this crosses a boundary from abortion in the womb to killing a partially delivered baby.",

As Republicans we believe most strongly in individual freedom and limited government intrusion in our personal decisions, including often difficult medical choices. By allowing legislators to regulate medicine based on their personal objections we are allowing their bias to dictate intimate family decisions. Now that the Court has allowed a ban on one medical procedure based on a 'moral concern', will it really be too long before we are completely denying the basic right to choose?\" http://www.gopchoice.org/\n \n \"Today the Supreme Court handed down a dangerous decision that not only threatens the future of Roe but is an insult to the women and the doctors of America.\" said RFC Chair Ann Stone. Five Justices, including Justice Kennedy who in the past has shown he knows better, said that women and their doctors are not responsible caretakers of their own health decisions and that the government knows better.\" http://www.republicansforchoice.com/Partial%20Birth%204-18-07.htm\n \n I post these to remind myself that not ALL Republican women who believe in the right to a safe and legal abortion are willing to coast on the efforts of their Democratic sisters and brothers in maintaining it. \n \n Washington, DC -- Despite the fact that the safety advantages of intact dilatation and evacuation (intact D&E) procedures are widely recognized-in medical texts, peer-reviewed studies, clinical practice, and in mainstream, medical care in the United States-the US Supreme Court today upheld the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003. \n \n According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' (ACOG) amicus brief opposing the Ban, the Act will chill doctors from providing a wide range of procedures used to perform induced abortions or to treat cases of miscarriage and will gravely endanger the health of women in this country. \n \n \"Today's decision to uphold the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 is shameful and incomprehensible to those of us who have dedicated our lives to caring for women,\" said Douglas W. Laube, MD, MEd, ACOG president. \"It leaves no doubt that women's health in America is perceived as being of little consequence. \n \n \"We have seen a steady erosion of women's reproductive rights in this country. The Supreme Court's action today, though stunning, in many ways isn't surprising given the current culture in which scientific knowledge frequently takes a back seat to subjective opinion,\" he added. \n \n This decision discounts and disregards the medical consensus that intact D&E is safest and offers significant benefits for women suffering from certain conditions that make the potential complications of non-intact D&E especially dangerous. Moreover, it diminishes the doctor-patient relationship by preventing physicians from using their clinical experience and judgment. \n \n \"On behalf of the 51,000 ACOG members who strive to provide the very best possible medical care to the women we serve, I can only hope that in the future, science will again be at the core of decision-making that affects the life and well-being of all of us,\" said Dr. Laube.

I'm not saying there aren't other reasons as well for support.\n\n \n \n \"Late-term\" is not a very precise term. \"Partial-birth abortion\" is equally subjective. This imprecision is not a trivial problem. The public and I daresay Congress may not know what is being outlawed. I know those who wrote the law were very aware of the terminology used and deliberately kept it vague. \n \n It may be late-term by default or even intention, but that is NOT what the law states. A specific medical procedure was outlawed. The Congress took it upon itself to define acceptable medical practice. It would be more appropriate to outlaw \"late-term\" abortions, defining what that is, as this would not be a medical determination. Again, however, I don't know if that is constitutional or not, but I suspect that is why the law was written as imprecisely as it was.\n \n Given a certain medical condition, say pregnancy at 14 weeks, the law says doctors may use certain procedures, except for one, even though the science says that this is the safest in that situation. It is exactly the same thing as saying one can not remove a gall bladder endoscopically, but only through an abdominal incision. \n \n The procedure is entails killing a fetus outside the womb versus inside.

When I say third trimester, that is approximate but I would probably also include a few weeks of the end of the second trimester as well (a full review of the literature and/or an extensive debate between neurologists on this issue could set a firmer timeline). Mental existence is so critically important to me because my moral stance is largely based on empathy - which one cannot have with a being prior to mental existence - and a reciprocity to others (treating others as you would expect to be treated).\n \n The criteria of viability (which Roe also uses) is troublesome to me because it is so dependent on our current technology. For examle, years from now, artificial wombs might be developed which allow an embryo or fetus to be sustained from very early periods. The reason this concerns me where the abortion debate is concerned (and there was a thread on this topic last year) is that any such artificial womb would be prohibitively expensive for the great majority of pregnancies. Therefore, the great majority of women with unwanted pregnancies would be faced with the same choices of abortion or forcefully taking a pregnancy to term. I just don't think a woman should be forced to take a pregnancy to term against her will while the living being inside her is still just a body with no mental existence and, therefore, no rights to life, in my view.\n \nThis is one of the arguments pro-lifers have used for years. I think it's important for pro-choicers to know about what you just mentioned, because I think part of what makes abortion defended in this country is that there are many people who take a stand-off clinical view of it; that it's just a procedure. But we know it's a procedure that causes pain and suffering for the fetus.\n\n This might be worth a thread of its own. You can start one if you like. Otherwise, I could start one, but there is still one question left which I have left to research (which I don't have time to do now). Namely, even though fetal anesthesia is not required in late term abortions, does that mean it is not used? I would need to research how often fetal anesthesia is actually used in late term abortions. Perhaps you might know that answer yourself and share a link.\n \nAnother problem (and reason I think this procedure is so hated) is that it really does involve partial delivery of the fetus. So no longer are you killing a fetus in the womb; a partially-delivered baby is being killed. Proponents of the procedure hate the phrase \"partial birth abortion\", but in fact that's what it is. The fetus is partially delivered before it is killed. So this crosses a boundary from abortion in the womb to killing a partially delivered baby.\n\n I think this touches upon an issue of rights or value of a fetus/baby born extremely prematurely - prior to any mental existence taking hold. Apart from the question of its survivability being very low, there is the question of who would take responsibility for it and whether it has rights by just being outside of the womb. I still think that it only has rights once it gains mental existence. However, at all stages of pregancy, the fetus/embryo has value (more value or less value depending on who is judging) because it has the potential to grow into a real person (i.e. one with mental existence). If those on the pro-life side value that ultra-premature baby so much, you can shell out the money to have those taken care of (something that would be highly expensive and give a very low chance of success with current technology).",

   "This is from the AMA and is a policy as identified on their website:\n \n \nH-5.982 Late-Term Pregnancy Termination Techniques \n \n \n (1) The term 'partial birth abortion' is not a medical term. The AMA will use the term \"intact dilatation and extraction\"(or intact D&X) to refer to a specific procedure comprised of the following elements: deliberate dilatation of the cervix, usually over a sequence of days; instrumental or manual conversion of the fetus to a footling breech; breech extraction of the body excepting the head; and partial evacuation of the intracranial contents of the fetus to effect vaginal delivery of a dead but otherwise intact fetus. This procedure is distinct from dilatation and evacuation (D&E) procedures more commonly used to induce abortion after the first trimester. Because 'partial birth abortion' is not a medical term it will not be used by the AMA. \n \n (2) According to the scientific literature, there does not appear to be any identified situation in which intact D&X is the only appropriate procedure to induce abortion, and ethical concerns have been raised about intact D&X. The AMA recommends that the procedure not be used unless alternative procedures pose materially greater risk to the woman. The physician must, however, retain the discretion to make that judgment, acting within standards of good medical practice and in the best interest of the patient. \n \n (3) The viability of the fetus and the time when viability is achieved may vary with each pregnancy. In the second-trimester when viability may be in question, it is the physician who should determine the viability of a specific fetus, using the latest available diagnostic technology. \n \n (4) In recognition of the constitutional principles regarding the right to an abortion articulated by the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade, and in keeping with the science and values of medicine, the AMA recommends that abortions not be performed in the third trimester except in cases of serious fetal anomalies incompatible with life. Although third-trimester abortions can be performed to preserve the life or health of the mother, they are, in fact, generally not necessary for those purposes. Except in extraordinary circumstances, maternal health factors which demand termination of the pregnancy can be accommodated without sacrifice of the fetus, and the near certainty of the independent viability of the fetus argues for ending the pregnancy by appropriate delivery. \n \n (5) The AMA urges the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as state health department officials to develop expanded, ongoing data surveillance systems of induced abortion. This would include but not be limited to: a more detailed breakdown of the prevalence of abortion by gestational age as well as the type of procedure used to induce abortion at each gestational age, and maternal and fetal indications for the procedure. Abortion-related maternal morbidity and mortality statistics should include reports on the type and severity of both short- and long-term complications, type of procedure, gestational age, maternal age, and type of facility. Data collection procedures should ensure the anonymity of the physician, the facility, and the patient. \n \n (6) The AMA will work with appropriate medical specialty societies, government agencies, private foundations, and other interested groups to educate the public regarding pregnancy prevention strategies, with special attention to at-risk populations, which would minimize or preclude the need for abortions. The demand for abortions, with the exception of those indicated by serious fetal anomalies or conditions which threaten the life or health of the pregnant woman, represent failures in the social environment, education, and contraceptive methods.

Laube, MD, MEd, ACOG president. \"It leaves no doubt that women's health in America is perceived as being of little consequence. \n \n \"We have seen a steady erosion of women's reproductive rights in this country. The Supreme Court's action today, though stunning, in many ways isn't surprising given the current culture in which scientific knowledge frequently takes a back seat to subjective opinion,\" he added. \n \n This decision discounts and disregards the medical consensus that intact D&E is safest and offers significant benefits for women suffering from certain conditions that make the potential complications of non-intact D&E especially dangerous. Moreover, it diminishes the doctor-patient relationship by preventing physicians from using their clinical experience and judgment. \n \n \"On behalf of the 51,000 ACOG members who strive to provide the very best possible medical care to the women we serve, I can only hope that in the future, science will again be at the core of decision-making that affects the life and well-being of all of us,\" said Dr. Laube. \n \n \n\n \n emphasis mine.\n http://www.acog.org/from_home/publications/press_releases/nr04-18-07.cfm",

   "Again, I am not talking about the jurors, but perhaps you were, sorry.\n \n It seems I may have completely misunderstood your original statement. Here was my take. I am going to speak in annoying generalities (that may or may not be true) for the purpose of trying to explain. \n \n This decision has broken with precedent somewhat. \n The stereotype position of conservatives has been that there are liberal activist courts who create law by breaking precedent. \n The stereotypical liberal position seems to be OK with the practice of not maintaining precedent. \n \n I thought you were saying those stereotypical liberals (the public, not the justices) are being inconsistent by wanting to stick with precedent only when it serves their interest. My counterpoint was that what is good for the liberal goose is good for the conservative gander - that the stereotypical conservative also wants the same.\n \n I hate speaking in stereotypes, plus it's a long word to type over and over. If I have your take on this whole topic incorrect, my apologies. \n \n Now, a different topic altogether, perhaps what you have been trying to state all along, \"Is there really no question about whether this ruling was correct or not?\" \n What do you think? I really don't know because I am not clear on what the decision was actually. My understanding is that a woman's right to choose regarding procedures of her own body still stands. But a legislature has the right to protect the health of a fetus as well. Have I got that right?\n \n I do think the law itself is a terrible idea because it presumes to practive medicine. Whether the law is constitutional is what this court decision is about and again, I do not understand exactly what the legal opinion was.\n\n \n Yeah, I was talking about the Supreme Court Justices which is important when looking at the case itself.",
