We've gone through a process of selection, over millions of years that has weeded out other species that weren't 'programmed' properly. Most of the species that ever existed, have died off, or changed into something even better. This process has allowed the 'best' equipped (whether it is desire or ability) to continue to exist while those that aren't equipped die out. That is why we, the survivors of countless battles for the right to exist, are so fit to remain alive and to reproduce. Our offspring are then given the benefit of all of those battles (plus one) and are thus able to survive. Some offspring will be better, some worse, some exactly the same, the better ones will have a better chance of carrying on but they will be pitted against the offspring of every other member of the species.",

   "the motivation to survive goes beyond what can be creditted for by conscious effort. talking in terms of \"want\", \"will\" or \"desire\" to survive is still inadequate. first of all, i'm not just talking about humans or animals. plants and other immobile forms of life demonstrate this motivation to survive without the capacity to think.\n \n when something threatens our survival, we detect it by experiencing some form of discomfort. all living things are programmed to change in some way when they encounter a life threatening environment. they either change internally by adapting to the environment, or they change externally by adjusting the environment or moving to a more suitable location. if the organism is in a life threatening environment and doesnt change, it dies\n \n besides the motivation for self survival, there also seems to be an underlying motivation for species survival, and an even greater and more universal motivation for the survival of life in general. there seems to be some quality of life itself, distinct from that of the sum of all living organisms, that is persistent and almost perpetual. somehow, life follows a self-constructive algorithm that other forms of energy dont seem to obey. its like life is a catylist that manipulates energy in a way that seems to defy most laws of physics. evolution breaks down the process of survival into simple terms, but it doesnt cover the underlying motivation of the persistence of life itself\n \n the more i think about it, the harder it is to wrap my head around. no motivation is more sublime and impelling. how do we quantify this? if anyone has come accross any links on this subject i'd be happy to get them",

At core, a simple chemical process replicating itself. Now, as it goes on, it grows more and more complex, and the better it gets at surviving, the better the chances are that it will manage to survive. In this way, starting from a simple chemical reaction, we come to the modern ecosystem.\n \n It's not that \"life wants to live\". It's more that \"life is living\".",

   "OK I think the best example of a biological need for survival is oxygen.\n For an adult human;\n No Food, life expectancy 2 weeks.\n No Water, life expectancy 2 days.\n No Oxygen, life expectancy 2 minutes.\n \n This is perhaps the most critical neccesity for life (for non-chemotrophs) and as such is an exteremely strong selection factor; (Natural Selection) So strong you don't need to think about it at all brething is automatic and will happen while you're unconcious. The first thing an young animal does when born or hatched isn't call for food, it breathes in.\n The most extreme example is a dolphin which has to swim to the surface as soon as it is free of it's mother.\n Any animal that doesn't have the instinct to breathe is dead, full stop.\n Our ability and instinct is evolved through their failure and our ancestor's success.\n Why does life want oxygen?\n Life is a chemical reaction and oxygen is a part of that reaction, like a fire without oxygen the flame goes out and it isn't a fire any more. \"Why does a flame want to burn?\" is effectively what you're asking.\n \n \ni'm thinking that if there is a way to tie our other needs to our physical needs so strongly that our motivation to succeed is directly associated with our motivation to survive, then we wouldn't even have to think about success, we would be reflexively and subconsciously impelled towards success.\n\n Success is in part a variable based on itraspecific competition within our peer group, biologically breeding displays by males are the classic example with success being defined by the number of females attracted. The whole population cannot be successful whch provides the basis of sexual selection which Darwin explores in some detail in \"The Descent of Man\" currently Dawkins also covers the subject in \"The Ancestor's Tale\" which adds a statisticians work that suggests that given sufficient generations any individual stands an 80% chance of being the common ancestor of the entire population with the other 20% being removed from the genepool completely, having no surviving descendents.",

Unlikely.\n \n Alternatively, we could try to recreate the conditions and see where processes start.
