   "When discussing the possibility of alien life the Drake equation is my favourite tool.\n \n For those of you who don't know what I'm talking about, the Drake equation is used to calculate the number of communicating civillisations in the galaxy.\n \n It is as follows:\n # of star in the galaxy * fraction of stars with planets * fraction of planets capable of supporting life * fraction of planets capable of supporting life where life actually arises * fracton of that life that evolves intelligence * fraction of that life reaches the level of technology to communicate on an intersteller level * the fraction of a planets lifetime that that civillisation survives for. \n \n If you assume that\n 1) There are 3e11 stars in the galaxy (estimates range from 1e11 to 5e11)\n 2) That 80% of stars have planets orbiting them.\n 3) That 10% of those planets are capable of supporting life.\n 4) That on half of those planets, life actually arises.\n 5) That out of that life 90% evolve intelligence\n 6) That out that life only 20% achieve intersteller communication like us.\n and:\n 7)Those civilisations only maintain their ability to communicate for 100 years before their civilisation comes to an end...\n \n That gives us the firgure of 216 communicating civillisations in our galaxy.\n \n Our galaxy has a diameter of 100,000 ly giving it a simplified area of ~8e9 ly^2. Thus the \"civillisation density\" for our galaxy is ~ 1 civilisation for every 4e7 ly.\n \n However* \n 1) I assumed that the galaxy was 2d\n 2) The factors I used in the Drake equation could be wrong.\n and:\n 3) Assumed uniform distribution of stars which is also not accurate.\n \n *These assumtions were made to simplify this calculation.\n \n Furthermore if we apply the first part of my calculation to the entire universe (ie billions of galaxies) then we get the approxamite number of civillisations in the galaxy:\n 216* one hundred billion galaxies = 2.16e14\n \n Therefore there are approx. 21.6 trillion communicating civillisations at any one moment in the universe.\n \n I'd like to ask:\n 1)Do you agree with my estimate.\n and:\n 2)What values would you give the seven factors in the Drake equation and why?",

   "daewoo: There is no known process to get life from non life even with a huge amount of luck.\n\n \n Even the Creationists have calculated that for a complete cell to form all at once the probability is 1 in 10^(some big number). No matter how big (some big number) is, it doesn't reduce the probability to 0, so that's not impossible: just astronomically improbable.\n \n Now, considering that real scientists don't look for a complete cell to form all at once, but instead look for just a self-replicating RNA (or some other)molecule to form, the probability is astronomicaly larger (farther away from 0) than the Creationist's 1 in 10^(some big number). \n \n Here is some of the Richard Dawkins material I was referring to:\n \n \nWe can accept a certain amount of luck in our explanations, but not too much. The question is, how much? The immensity of geological time entitles us to postulate more improbable coincidences than a court of law would allow but, even so, there are limits. Cumulative selection is the key to all our modern explanations of life. It strings a series of acceptably lucky events [random mutations] together in a nonrandom sequence so that, at the end of the sequence, the finished product carries the illusion of being very very lucky indeed, far too improbable to have come about by chance alone, even given a timespan millions of times longer than the age of the universe so far. Cumulative selection is the key but it had to get started, and we cannot escape the need to postulate a single-step chance event in the origin of cumulative selection itself....\n \n The more we can get away from miracles, major improbabilities, fantastic coincidences, large chance events, and the more thoroughly we can break large chance events up into a cumulative series of small chance events, the more satisfying to rational minds our explanations will be. But in this chapter we are asking how improbable, how miraculous, a single event we are allowed to postulate. What is the largest single event of sheer naked coincidence, sheer unadulterated miraculous luck, that we are allowed to get away with in our theories, and still say that we have a satisfactory explanation of life?\n So, there are some levels of sheer luck, not only too great for puny human imaginations, but too great to be allowed in our hard-headed calculations about the origin of life. But, to repeat the question, how great a level of luck, how much of a miracle, are we allowed to postulate?...The answer to our question - of how much luck we are allowed to postulate - depends upon whether our planet is the only one that has life, or whether life abounds all around the universe. ... There are probably at least 10^20 (i.e. 100 billion billion) roughly suitable planets in the universe.\n \n It is entirely possible that our backwater of a planet is literally the only one that has ever borne life. ... If the origin of life is such an improbable event that it happened on only one planet in the universe, then our planet has to be that planet.\n \n Our question was, how much luck are we allowed to assume in a theory of the origin of life on Earth? ... Begin by giving a name to the probability, however low it is, that life will originate on any randomly designated planet of some particular type. Call this number the spontaneous generation probability or SGP. It is the SGP that we shall arrive at if we sit down with our chemistry textbooks, or strike sparks through plausible mixtures of atmospheric gases in our laboratory, and calculate the odds of replicating molecules springing spontaneously into existence in a typical planetary atmosphere. Suppose that our best guess of the SGP is some very very small number, say one in a billion....if we assume, as we are perfectly entitled to do for the sake of argument, that life has originated only once in the universe, it follows that we are allowed to postulate a very large amount of luck in a theory, because there are so many planets in the universe where life could have originated. If, as one estimate has it, there are 100 billion billion planets, this is 100 billion times greater than even the very low SGP that we postulated. To conclude this argument, the maximum amount of luck that we are allowed to assume, before we reject a particular theory of the origin of life, has odds of one in N, where N is the number of suitable planets in the universe. There is a lot hidden in that word 'suitable', but let us put an upper limit of 1 in 100 billion billion for the maximum amount of luck that this argument entitles us to assume\n \n We go to a chemist and say, .fill your head with formulae, and your flasks with methane and ammonia and hydrogen and carbon dioxide and all the other gases that a primeval nonliving planet can be expected to have; cook them all up together; pass strokes of lightning through your simulated atmospheres, and strokes of inspiration through your brain; bring all your clever chemist's methods to bear, and give us your best chemist's estimate of the probability that a typical planet will spontaneously generate a self-replicating molecule. Or, to put it another way, how long would we have to wait before random chemical events on the planet, random thermal jostling of atoms and molecules, resulted in a self- replicating molecule?...we'd have to wait a long time by the standards of a human lifetime, but perhaps not all that long by the standards of cosmological time....even if the chemist said that we'd have to wait for a 'miracle', have to wait a billion billion years - far longer than the universe has existed, we can still accept this verdict with equanimity. There are probably more than a billion billion available planets in the universe. If each of them lasts as long as Earth, that gives us about a billion billion billion planet-years to play with. That will do nicely! A miracle is translated into practical politics by a multiplication sum.\" (Richard Dawkins, The Blind Watchmaker, Penguin, 1991, p139-145) \n",

   "Yes and on the randomness point I don't see anything \"random\" in a process that took a few billion years just to get past the single celled stage.\n \n I'd think of it more in terms of life evolving being inevitable, given the right environment.\n\n \n Your second line answers the first. The reason it took so long for things to evolve into multi-celled creatures was the environment, specifically oxygen. If you're multi-celled, but don't yet have things like hearts and lungs, then the oxygen content of your environment must be high enough that diffusion will be sufficient to bring oxygen to all your cells. It took billions of years, but alga eventually got the oxygen concentrations high enough, and once they did there was an explosion of new life forms that evolved to take advantage of this new resource.",
