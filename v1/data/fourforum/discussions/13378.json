   "Only in uber ultra right America:\n Daily Kos: ABC News 'Stunned' To Discover Dead Peasant Insurance\n \n \nMichael Moore's Capitalism, A Love Story has revealed a deep dark secret to the intrepid reporters of ABC News - so-called Dead Peasant Insurance, the practice of companies taking out secret life insurance policies on their low-level employees, with the benefits paid out to the company upon the employee's death, even if they no longer work at the company.\n\n And, of course, these filthy rich companies don't pay taxes on these death profits proceeds, which means that you and I, the common taxpayer, pay more taxes so that corporations can reap, to the fullest extent, the benefits of their death profits.\n \n Ya talk about your grim reaper!",

It is hardly a valid source for any thing beyond leftist wet dreams. ABC is hardly a right wing group being part and parcel of DNC propaganda arm. If any thing it proves the left does eat their young.",
