However, should the Cards pull out a victory, I will still have to pull for the yankees over the rebels, even though I come from the Deep South...God's country!\n\n \n \n I think it will be hard for the Astros to pull off another victory tonight. Their bullpen is shot...Lidge has thrown in the last 5 games, some of them 2 and 3 innings each. He threw 3 last night. Wheeler also threw 2 or 3 last night. Other than that, their bullpen is basically garbage. Unless Clemens can somehow throw 9 innings and shut down the Cardinals, I find it hard for them to win. The St. Louis bullpen is still rather fresh, minus Isringhausen. Ray King, Cal Eldred, and Danny Haren didn't throw at all last night. Julian Tavarez has only thrown 2 innings in the last 3 games.\n \n It is pretty apparent that Game 7 will come down to the bullpen, unless the starters can basically throw a shutout or limit the other team to 1 or 2 runs, which is highly unlikely. I am calling at least 1 homerun for Pujols tonight.\n \n My prediction for the World Series: Cardinals over Red Sox in 6 games",
