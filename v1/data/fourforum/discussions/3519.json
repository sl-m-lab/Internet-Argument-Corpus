   "It's obvious something is wrong with the two main parties, even if you just look at the fact that they are not allowing 3rd party candidates to debate with them, or have proper coverage in the media. I believe they are controlled by the same forces behind the scenes. \n \n I like Michael Peroutka for pres. and Chuck Baldwin for vp are candidates from the Constitution party who are for God, family, nation and restoration of the Constitution. If you get on the mailing list, you will see good things. If you check out their website, there's a section with alot of news articles to read. Too bad we don't have at least 6 more months to prepare for this.\n \n There is so much corruption that has gone on for decades from the 2 main parties, I believe it's time to raise up a 3rd party as a way to offset this. Don't be afraid to vote for a 3rd party candidate. I believe it's time for something new to happen. Here are links for your review. \n http://www.constitutionparty.org/\n http://www.wevoteprolife.com\n http://www.politics1.com should have just about all candidates in each state\n http://www.http://www.soulwellmall.com/news.html\n for alternative news sources",

Perot participated in the debates and got a sizable percentage of the vote, and Jesse Ventura won a governorship. They really had their foot in the door. Squabbling amoungst themselves ruined it for them. I don't think the other two partys had much to do with their demise.",
