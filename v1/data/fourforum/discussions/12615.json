   "What a ridiculous \"study\" (if I could call it that.)\n \n Where should I start off? First off, it posts nothing, really, on how the 90% number is reached. It just spouts off some diatribe about how the NRA is lying and how they are right because ATF told them so. Where are the real numbers? The reason they fail to post it is because that 90% number is big lie. I already posted a graph showing how they got that number and also posted the right amount of guns traced (look around this section in gun control.)\n \n Secondly, they contradict themselves. If the Cartels are truly using ak-47's and ar-15's as they stated, why is there less ammunition of that type being confiscated? If the choice of weapon was the ak-47 and ar-15 they'd be finding a lot more than 4,000 rounds of 7.62 and a lot more of 5.56 nato. Do they really believe me to believe this? Heck I have a lot more ammo than they have confiscated which tells you a lot (basically that the guns of choice are NOT the ak-47 and the ar-15 and most likely smaller calibers like the 9mm or 40 cal. Not only that, they make the definition of \"assault weapon\" very broad including even guns that are NOT assault weapons as they are allowed to be imported (no \"non-sporting\" firearm may be imported into the US, the Saiga they listed is an imported firearm.) So, again what is an assault weapon and what is not? Like I said the term \"assault weapon\" is non-existent because the ban is no longer in effect and they no longer apply. Simply having a pistol grip allows the gun to be AW according to VPC, sorry, but that is plain \"puppy cow\" like one of my professors says.\n \n Another thing is they are relying on one particular case (the one that seems where they got all those number for their ammunition confiscation list). They neither elaborate on anymore cases like this because most likely they are non-existent or because they do not deal of anything of particular importance to them and their agenda.\n \n \n That being said, if gun dealers are knowingly dealing with people they know are smuggling across the border, they should be prosecuted. The ATF, while they do a crappy job in some respects, are doing a good job it seems on tracking down arms traffickers. That deserves merit, but it doesn't allow them or give them the authority to stomp on our liberties or demand certain laws that would make their \"job easier.\" Please next time post a study with some relevance. The VPC hardly touched on anything in this study that we didn't already know. They also try very hard to paint certain guns like the 5-7 as armory piercing (which is a big lie because hand gun armor piercing rounds are prohibited in the US).",

   "Gun Ownership at All-Time High, Violent Crime Near 30-Year Low \n \n Over the last two decades, many \"gun control\" laws have been eliminated or made less restrictive at the federal, state, and local levels. Numbers of privately-owned guns and Right-to-Carry states have risen to all-time highs. Every step of the way, \"gun control\" groups predicted violent crime would increase. Instead, violent crime decreased dramatically. \n \n Less \"Gun Control\": The Brady Act's handgun waiting period expired in 1998, in favor of the NRA-supported National Instant Check System. Some states thereafter eliminated waiting periods or purchase permit requirements. The federal \"assault weapon\" ban expired in 2004. Since 1987, 30 states have eliminated prohibitory or restrictive carry laws, in favor of Right-to-Carry (RTC) laws; there are now 40 RTC states. All states have hunter protection laws, 46 have range protection laws, 47 prohibit local jurisdictions from imposing gun laws more restrictive than state law, 44 protect the right to arms in their constitutions, and Congress and 33 states have prohibited frivolous lawsuits against the firearm industry.1 Studies by or for Congress, the Congressional Research Service, the Library of Congress, the National Institute of Justice, the National Academy of Sciences, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have found no evidence that \"gun control\" reduces crime.2\n \n More Guns: The number of new guns rises by about 4.5 million every year.3 There are 250+ million privately-owned firearms in the United States.4\n \n Less Violent Crime: Since 1991, the nation's total violent crime rate is down 38 percent. (Murder is down 43 percent; rape, 29 percent; robbery, 46 percent; and aggravated assault, 35 percent.) Violent crime dropped every year from 1991-2004, to a 30-year low; increased slightly in 2005 and 2006; and decreased to nearly the 2004 level in 2007. Every year since 2002, the violent crime rate has been lower than anytime since 1974. Every year since 1999, the murder rate has been lower than anytime since 1966. States with RTC laws, compared to the rest of the country, have lower violent crime rates on average: total violent crime by 24 percent, murder, 28 percent; robbery, 50 percent; and aggravated assault, 11 percent.5\n \n Notes:\n \n 1.

   "Anti-Gunners and .50 Cal. Rifles:\n Same Song, Different Gun \n \n Anti-gun groups and Rep. Jim Moran (D-Va.) are making far-fetched claims about crimes they believe might be committed with .50 caliber rifles.1 Urged on by such speculations, CBS and CNN recently aired unbalanced, irresponsible stories portraying the rifles as \"too dangerous to be in the hands of private citizens\" and \"a clear and present danger to the public safety.\"2 Instead, the facts are:\n \n .50 caliber rifles have existed since the 1860s. Those that use modern .50 cal. ammunition have existed for a half century. Those that anti-gunners attack now have existed since the 1980s. \n .50 caliber rifles are virtually unheard of in crime. Modern .50 caliber rifles are too large, heavy, and expensive for most criminals. They generally measure 4-5 feet in length, weigh between 22-34 pounds, and cost thousands of dollars. The VPC has identified only two crimes in the U.S. since 1992 in which a .50 caliber rifle was fired. \n Most .50 caliber owners use their rifles for long-range target shooting competitions. Long-range matches have been common for more than a century. For 20 years, the Fifty Caliber Shooters Association has been the nation's leading exponent of .50 caliber marksmanship competitions. \n Modern .50 caliber rifle ammunition was invented in the 1920s. Despite anti-gunners' claims, Mk211 .50 cal. rounds are not available to the public, but are restricted to military use only. \n The use of modern .50 caliber rifles by private citizens has played a key role in developing the rifles for subsequent military use. Most rifles, pistols, and shotguns used by today's military were first used by civilians. Civilians have owned most of the same firearms as the military throughout America's history. Under federal law, civilians have comprised the Militia of the U.S. since 1792, and federal law has encouraged civilian ownership of military firearms since 1905. \n Anti-gunners are just trying to manufacture an issue to rejuvenate their gun-banning agenda, which collapsed last year when Congress allowed the Clinton Gun Ban to expire, after independent studies for Congress showed that the ban had been a mistake.3 The Congressional Research Service's report also exposed anti-gun groups' false claims about the ban.4 Ultimately, anti-gunners always want to ban something\u00d0all handguns, small handguns, semi-auto rifles, pump-action shotguns, .50 cal. rifles, or varmint-caliber pistols. But whatever the gun, anti-gunners' rhetoric is always the same.\n \n 1.

And its a whopper. One of those urban legends that Goebbels would be proud of. Tell it enough times and maybe it will become true.\n \n The 90% number reported by Hoover came from a small group of weapons turned over to the U.S. for tracing, but they were by no means all of the weapons seized by Mexican authorities. A spokesman for the ATFE, Matt Allen, has now \"clarified\" the number and admitted that only 17% of the weapons found at crime scenes in Mexico have been traced to the U.S. Ironically, while Mexican officials have freely used the 90% number from the ATFE, they have not themselves made such a charge based on their own numbers. The truth is, they know better. ",
