The link initially provided was a rather weak summary of the data followed by an opinion rendered by the writer on the status of military effectiveness. It struck me as yet another piece where the military could be tarred by the actions of the few. I have seen plenty of these already. Had ye posted the original data rather than the hatchet job, this little tete a tete would never have happened.\n \n To continue: Your data correlates with the 4% figure I presented for those soldiers who have actually considered themselves party to abuse - physically kicked, hit a noncombatant when not necessary. I personally do not care what percentage of soldiers verbally abused noncombatants in a language they do not speak. You could call me any number of abusive things in Farsi and I would not take offense as is the case with you I would assume unless ye are fluent in Farsi. \n \n Third: I do not dispute that 1% is unfortunate, nay, appalling even if one person and one alone were guilty of said offense. This is consistent with my earlier statement. I do not condone the action of the one criminal but neither do I implicate the group for the action of that one criminal. \n \n Fourth: I question whether Joe 20 year old snuffy has a grasp of whether he is destroying property with just cause or no. That Joe does not possess the full S-2 intel and thus is in no position to judge whether his actions are \"necessary\". The data suggest that the average age is 20-24, the soldier has less than 3 years in the military, and is junior enlisted. These are not the soliders who have operational awareness of necessity.\n \n Secondly, you earlier agreed even 1% abusing iraqi civilians was unacceptable, but now you believe these much higher rates are acceptable (or at least, not a failure). What have you been smoking since then?\n \n \n Are you unable reconcile that the verbal abuse and \"physically hitting and kicking\" accused of the US Soldiers and Marines pales in comparison to the fact that the Insurgents do not merely verbally abuse the populace but rather blow them the f*** up? \n \n Now, you see, we are actually in agreement on much: One case of abuse is too much. We also agree that in a perfect world, our soldiers would smile and the Insurgents would voice their objection through interpretive dance. Then we could all gather together for a cultural exchange. In the meantime, we must acknowledge our own mistakes in proper proportion to the miasma of brutality that is Iraq.",

A fair random sampling OR, since this was done by 'office of the surgeon-general', were they a sampling of soldiers who were experiencing some form of mental or physical issue arising from their service as it was a 'mental health survey'. \n From what I gather, not many military forces naturally report 'mental health issues' for various fears of retaliation. So, the only ones who'd want to do this self reporting on a survey...may logically be those who already have by stating they have mental health issues (real or exagerated).\n A survey of soldiers suffering from PTSD and other complications would obviously yield a different result than say soldiers in Iraq but nowhere near any combat (marching band members or something silly like that).\n How well was the survey done and how unbiased was it.\n \n For all we know, the results of abuse could even be higher than reported...maybe 10% of the marching band members decided to go harrase Iraqi school children one day.\n \n \n Personally, I'm working on a marvelous military strategy that I will impose once I'm elected to office. In a fit of Deje Vu, UK soldiers in Afghanistan also started implementing it. They call it 'Gun and Run.'\n Basically, you just rush in, raid an area, shoot everything and leave.\n \n I believe this would work great on the international level. Coupled with 'Snatch and Grab'.\n Basically, someone thumbs their nose as my country, I knock them down to caveman levels with massive expendatures of WMD's. Then, salt their soil and pollute their water, infect their children...then leave.\n Seems to be something US soldiers would be capable of doing. Since we really sux at holding ground as occupiers, so why bother?\n We wouldn't even have to do much more than push some buttons to achieve this goal.\n If we needed anything, we could send in the idio...erm the best our military has to offer and simply steal it while the rest of our guys and shooting.\n \n \n I wonder how many nations I could mess with before some Rambo type pulls me out of my bunker and yanks my clown suit off (You really must always wear a clown suit...that way people know you were 'Just joking').\n emoticon_xgood",

   "Isn't it a \"silent plot of the generals\" or so in Washington, D.C? Unlike Hitler generals our ones didn't dare to attack the president in open and chose just to leave him in peace ... alone... vs. Iraq. LOL Well, some Pentagon sources I can't identify here assert top generals are leaving the ranks in piles. Not all of'em 'course but 5 or so, which in fact has no precedent in Pentagon's history! It's due to crazy Bush's decision to send more troopers to Iraq and go on with the loosing mission there. Is he really set to, I wonder?\n Now, instead of all those 5 veteran generals we are having one \"war tsar\" Douglas Lute. Why is this newly created position of \"assistant to the president and national security adviser for Iraq and Afghanistan\"? According to the sources Lt.Gen. Douglas Lute has been a strong advocate of withdrawal from Iraq. It's quite arresting fact I should say. \n I tend to think our commander-in-chief has just run out of ideas relating that boring Iraq. He doesn't know recipe of how to get out of the mess and save face. Now at least he's found the man for a whipping boy role in Iraq. (Perhaps there are some events planned in Iraq after which the withdrawal will be justified).\n Look here, guys. I am nearly sure Bush is going to quit Iraq. But what a cost it is!
