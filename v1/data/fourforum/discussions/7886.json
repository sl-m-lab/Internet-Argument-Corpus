   "Well this ought to fire up some folks! \n \n The following comments of Bill Cosby were collected from various sites:\n \n Cosby, contrasting the achievements of civil rights giants of the past with today's generation, observed that a lot of \"lower economic people are not holding up their end in this deal. These people are not parenting. They are buying things for kids -- $500 sneakers for what? And won't spend $200 for 'Hooked on Phonics.' \n \n On Poor Educational Achievement: \"I can't even talk the way these people talk, 'Why you ain't,' 'Where you is,'\" Cosby said. \"I blamed the kid until I heard the mother talk-and then I heard the father talk. Everybody knows it's important to speak English except these knuckleheads. You can't be a doctor with that kind of cr@p coming out of your mouth.\" Cosby said many young blacks have \"very, very thin\" book bags and are \"going nowhere.\"\n \n On Sexual Irresponsibility: Cosby blamed music, movies, and television for encouraging young blacks toward sexual irresponsibility. \"These young girls have no business having sex,\" Cosby said. \"We've got too many young girls who don't know how to parent, turning themselves into parents. Ladies and gentlemen, our little 8-year-old boys, 9-year-old boys [are] having er@ctions and only acting out what they see and hear on some CD. ... It's time to stop!\"\n \n The illegitimacy rate among blacks in 1940 was only 19 percent. Unfortunately, the rate among African Americans has reached crisis proportions-more than 68 percent. In others words, two in every three blacks are being born into homes without a married father present (a moral failing). \n \n On Lack of Personal Responsibility: Black men need to take responsibility and stop blaming others (including the White Man), Cosby said. \"Young men and old men, you've gotta stop beating up your women because you didn't find a job, because you didn't want to get an education, and now you are [earning] minimum wage,\" he said. \"You should have thought more of yourself in high school.\" Also: \"The housing project was set up for you to move in, move up, and move out.\"\n \n On Blacks in prison: \"These are not political criminals. These are people going around stealing Coca-Cola. People getting shot in the back of the head over (stealing) a piece of pound cake and then we run out and we are outraged, [saying] 'The cops shouldn't have shot him.' What the hell was he doing with the (stolen) pound cake in his hand?\"\n \n Cosby snapped (to Blacks), \"Let me tell you something. Your dirty laundry gets out of school at 2:30 every day. It's cursing and calling each other (the \"N\" word) as they're walking up and down the street. They think 'they hip.' Can't read, can't write, 50 percent of them.\"\n \n Is Cosby right on what is referenced above? What moral or immoral values and philosophies are at play here? \n \n Feel free to add other comments of Cosby's for discussion.",

You may want to consider that your tone and wording often smacks of condescension, superiority and callousness. It doesn't sound caring or compassionate.

   "We have actual scientific data that shows that in most cases for whatever reason prayer is no substitute for medicine.

   "First, let me apologize for the length of this post. I have a lot to say. Also, I'll warn you that I'm not a linguist, but this is a hot topic in the linguistics class in which I'm enrolled, and I've provided links to as many things as I could find.\n \n I'm intrigued by this discussion of Black English. Of course, it doesn't surprise me that Easyrider has no idea what he's talking about.\n \n \nA failure to use proper English, resulting in corporate America not wanting to hire such individuals. \"What you say?\"\n\n \n Here's a question: Who speaks proper English? Could you define it for us? What part of the country speaks proper English? Is it the southwest? The Midwest, maybe? How about the deep south? New England? Maybe it's the Tangiermen who live off the coast of Virginia? These are all distinct variations of English. Surely one must be proper, and all the others are incorrect. Do you have a problem with people speaking these incorrect language variations?\n \n It clearly isn't the blacks though, right? Their way of speaking is nothing but sloppy sentences and meaningless slang, right? WRONG!\n \n Black English is NOT sloppy, it is NOT lazy, and it isn't slang. It has definable rules of phonology and syntax, and a long and fairly well documented history:\n \n Around 400 years ago, during the slave trade, the colonies captured their slaves from many areas across West Africa, where many different languages were spoken. Because the slaves greatly outnumbered the slaveowners, they did everything they could to prevent the slaves from organizing and rebelling. The easiest way to do this would be to take away their ability to communicate by grouping these different languages together. But language is hardly a static thing, so these languages that were in contact with one another eventually became a pidgin. Over time, and with additional contact with the Southern English spoken by many slaveowners, the pidgin became a full fledged creole. After the emancipation of the slaves, Black English found its way into urban areas, where it is most prevalent today.\n \n At the most basic, Black English uses English words in the syntax (sentence structure, more or less) of the West African Languages. Many words also have their pronunciation altered to match the phonology of those African languages. Actually, this link probably explains it much better than I ever could: http://www.une.edu.au/langnet/aave.htm\n \n A number of factors, ranging from outright racism to a mere lack of understanding, have led to Black English being highly stigmatized. Its speakers are seen as uneducated and unmotivated, but that is hardly necessarily true. Not all speakers of Black English are uneducated (look at Oprah, for example, who speaks both Black English and a more accepted, \"standard\" English). And of course not every uneducated person speaks Ebonics. It isn't restricted to race, either. Plenty of white kids who grow up in urban areas might end up speaking Ebonics as well.\n \n Now, I'm not saying that employers necessarily need to change their ways. Black English is difficult to understand for those that don't speak it, and it is important, to an extent, to know how to speak and write more accepted forms of English, for the simple fact that it is more widely used and there is a level of prestige associated with it. Regardless of one's reason for speaking it, Black English puts its speakers at a disadvantage. But you have to understand, Easyrider, that it's probably just as difficult for speakers of Black English to learn to speak \"Proper English\" as it would be for you to learn Black English.\n \n People who speak Black English should not be derided for the language they speak, just as people who speak Tangier English, or Hawaiian English, or Scots, should not be derided for the language they speak. If you want them to be able to achieve, they need to be educated. It all starts in the schools. In 1996, the Oakland School Board adopted a resolution to use Ebonics in schools as a transitional tool to teach its speakers how to read and write standard English. The resolution can be found here. This attempt, however, failed because of the stigma associated with Black English. People just could not accept Ebonics being used in the classroom because of its image as uneducated and sloppy. Ironically, it was largely parents of the black children who were opposed to the resolution. In fact, all over the country, black students are incorrectly placed in special education because their teachers cannot recognize the characteristics of Black English and instead think that their speech is a result of mental disability (http://www.inmotionmagazine.com/peterz1.html)\n \n It's not the language itself that puts its speakers at a disagvantage, it's the stigma attached to that language. If people can try to understand something before they immediately speak out against it, maybe something good could come of it.",

   "How appropos\n \n \n\n By Michael E. Ross\n Reporter\n MSNBC\n Updated: 2:36 a.m. ET April 7, 2006\n \n At a time when the U.S. economy is on the upswing and more people are finding work, young African American men are falling further behind. \n That's the grim portrait painted by three new and forthcoming books by scholars at Columbia, Georgetown and Princeton universities. The picture isn't new, but the depths of its despair and pathology are.\n \n The U.S. Census Bureau estimates there are about 5 million black men in America between the ages of 20 and 39. The new books, and an earlier one from Harvard, find them losing ground in mainstream American society, despite advances made by black women, presumably part of the same socioeconomic experience.\n \n This vexing problem, caused by a variety of social ills, is equally vexing when scholars consider what causes it.\n \n Among the studies' findings:\n \n Rates of imprisonment for young black men escalated throughout the 1990s and continued climbing well into the current decade. About 16 percent of black men in their twenties who were not college students were either in jail or in prison.\n African Americans are seven times more likely to go to prison or jail than whites.\n Almost 60 percent of black male high school dropouts in their early thirties have spent time in prison.\n The percentage of young jobless black men continues to increase, part of a trend that generally hasn't abated in decades. In 2000, about 65 percent of black male high-school dropouts had no jobs, either because they couldn't find work or because they were in jail. By 2004, the studies found that number had grown to 72 percent. The numbers for young black men were higher than for whites and Hispanics similarly affected.\n Making matters worse, a forthcoming book, which includes a study of nearly 1,500 private employers in New York City, found that black job applicants with no criminal records weren't any more likely to get a job than white applicants who were just out of prison.\n \n Persistence of imbalance\n \"A lot of people are skeptical that African Americans still face discrimination in the job market. But even in a diverse city like New York, the evidence of discrimination is unmistakable,\" said Devah Pager, a Princeton sociology professor, in announcing \"Punishment and Inequality in America,\" to be published in June.\n \n \"The 1990s were an eye-opener,\" said Harry Holzer, a professor of public policy at Georgetown University. \"You had the strongest labor market in 30 years; all things being equal, those were good times for African Americans. A lot of black moms were entering the labor market, but the dads kept dropping out.\"\n \n Holzer's new book, \"Reconnecting Disadvantaged Young Men,\" was co-written with two other scholars. The third book is \"Black Males Left Behind,\" edited by Columbia University professor Ronald B. Mincy. A 2004 book, \" Dropouts in America,\" found similarly dire circumstances for young black men. \n \n One problem, many causes\n Holzer sees many reasons for the bleak situation: unemployment, enduring bias in American life, the disproportionate impact of the war on drugs.\n \"When you look at what's responsible, there's a lot of stories,\" he said. \"The labor market changed a lot. There was a disappearance of good jobs for less educated men. For blacks you have continuing problems of discrimination, job flight from the cities.\"\n \"The worst employment problems are in the Northeast areas - Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, the Rust Belt cities where a generation ago black men relied on heavy manufacturing. The fraction of black men in heavy manufacturing has dropped precipitously,\" Holzer said\n \"Those areas are also among the most racially segregated in the country. It might not just be the disappearance of those jobs - some of the work got outsourced - but also the disappearance of the quality of schools and neighborhoods left behind.\"\n Holzer also cited state child-support systems and more aggressive enforcement of laws against \"deadbeat dads,\" late or delinquent on support payments.\n But for Holzer, the biggest problem is the large number of imprisoned men. \"When you have a system where one-third of African American men are in the criminal justice system, you're going to have problems.\"\n He says solutions will be rooted in education and employment. \"I think we need to emphasize three broad approaches: first, a range of education, training and youth development, especially in middle school and high school, to prevent boys from disconnecting and to prepare them for the labor market.''\n \"Then we need to improve their financial incentives to accept lower-wage jobs by raising the minimum wage and extending the earned income tax credit to low-income childless adults, especially if they pay child support,\" Holzer said. \"And we should address the specific problems faced by ex-offenders and non-custodial fathers as they attempt to enter the labor market.\" \n 'Self-fulfilling prophecy'\n Otherwise, Holzer senses the persistence of a chilling condition among young black American men, what might be called pre-emptive despair. \n \"You see this disconnection problem, with young boys in their adolescent years starting to drift away,\" he said. \n \"The girls are graduating more. But it's almost as if these young boys look down the road and sense a bleak future and they disconnect early - a self-fulfilling prophecy.\" \n \u00a9 2006 MSNBC Interactive \n \n\n \n I'd call that a train wreck Simone, wouldn't you? emoticon_confused",

   "First, let me apologize for the length of this post. I have a lot to say. Also, I'll warn you that I'm not a linguist, but this is a hot topic in the linguistics class in which I'm enrolled, and I've provided links to as many things as I could find.\n \n I'm intrigued by this discussion of Black English. Of course, it doesn't surprise me that Easyrider has no idea what he's talking about.\n \n Here's a question: Who speaks proper English? Could you define it for us? What part of the country speaks proper English? Is it the southwest? The Midwest, maybe? How about the deep south? New England? Maybe it's the Tangiermen who live off the coast of Virginia? These are all distinct variations of English. \n\n \n So, if someone came for a job interview and used mostly slang, was difficult to understand, and even used profanity at times, you'd think the employer would be wrong for refusing to hire them (especially in a customer service or PR type job)?\n \n And there's a very easy way to tell if something is proper English or not: the dictionary. \"Ebonics\" isn't just a different accent as in the deep south. It's a form of language that replaces words and phrases in large part with slang. What if suddenly a large group of people decided they wanted pig latin to be taken by society as validly as normal English? We have to have some standards, and ultimately this is about what the standards are and what they are not. There aren't really very many differences between basic American english and the english spoken in England (a very few differences in vocabulary). That's what society considers the standard for English. The geographical areas you mention mostly stay with it as well, except in accent. Ebonics is a very radical departure from it.",

   "So, if someone came for a job interview and used mostly slang, was difficult to understand, and even used profanity at times, you'd think the employer would be wrong for refusing to hire them (especially in a customer service or PR type job)?\n\n \n Did you even read all of my post or what?\n \n No, that's not what I'm saying at all, because Black English is not slang, or profanity. I'm not denying that speakers of Ebonics use slang or expletives, because speakers of nearly all languages use slang and expletives. But, once again, BLACK ENGLISH IS NOT SLANG. Slang are words that are passing language fads. The slang of today is different than the slang of 40 years ago, or 100 years ago. The characteristics of Black English, including phonology, syntax, and grammar are definable and structured.\n \n Here's the link again: http://www.une.edu.au/langnet/aave.htm\n \n I even said, in my post, that it is important for children to learn to speak and write what is defined as \"Proper English\" because that is what employers want.\n \n \nAnd there's a very easy way to tell if something is proper English or not: the dictionary.\n\n \n The dictionary is nothing more than a list of words and their definitions. Dictionaries include slang, colloquialisms, acronyms, made-up words (like \"d'oh\"), and words borrowed from other languages. It makes no value judgements as to which words are \"proper\" and which aren't, because it's just a reference tool. And they're far from comprehensive, because languages can change very quickly. That's the unique thing about human languages: the ability to create novel utterances. I can make up a new word, on the spot. In fact, I'll do that right now. Let's make this word \"blarp\". A \"blarp\" is a person who doesn't understand my point. Now, you may say that \"blarp\" isn't a word. But it is. I can say blarp, you can say blarp. Any speaker of English can say it. It has a meaning, because I gave it one. That's all I need for something to be a word. Not anybody's approval, not a dictionary. So stop being such a blarp.\n \n \n\"Ebonics\" isn't just a different accent as in the deep south. It's a form of language that replaces words and phrases in large part with slang.\n\n \n I've posted the link twice. Please read it and familiarize yourself with how Ebonics IS NOT SLANG. Many of the words used in Black English came from West African languages. Here are examples, from the link that I've posted twice:\n \n \nA discussion of AAVE vocabulary might proceed by noting that words can be seen to be composed of a form (a sound signal) and a meaning. In some cases both the form and the meaning are taken from West African sources. In other case the form is from English but the meaning appears to be derived from West African sources. Some cases are ambiguous and seem to involve what the late Fredric Cassidy called a multiple etymology (the form can be traced to more than one language -- e.g. \"cat\" below).\n \n West African Form + West African Meaning:\n \n bogus 'fake/fraudulent' cf. Hausa boko, or boko-boko 'deceit, fraud'.\n \n hep, hip 'well informed, up-to-date' cf. Wolof hepi, hipi 'to open one's eyes, be aware of what is going on'.\n \n English Form + West African Meaning:\n \n cat 'a friend, a fellow, etc.' cf. Wolof -kat (a suffix denoting a person)\n \n cool 'calm, controlled' cf. Mandingo suma 'slow' (literally 'cool')\n \n dig 'to understand, appreciate, pay attention' cf. Wolof deg, dega 'to understand, appreciate'\n \n bad 'really good' \n \n In West African languages and Caribbean creoles a word meaning 'bad' is often used to mean 'good' or 'alot/intense'. For instance, in Guyanese Creole mi laik am bad, yu noo means 'I like him alot'. Dalby mentions Mandingo (Bambara) a nyinata jaw-ke 'She's very pretty.' (literally 'She is beautiful bad.'); cf. also Krio ( a creole language spoken in West Africa) mi gud baad.\n\n \n These words ARE NOT SLANG, because they are derived from common words in other languages and have been used for long periods of time. \n \n \nWhat if suddenly a large group of people decided they wanted pig latin to be taken by society as validly as normal English?\n\n \n Irrelevant. Pig Latin, to my knowledge, has no native speakers. Therefore someone who speaks Pig Latin is likely fluent in their own native language as well. The problem with Ebonics, though, is that people are raised in an environment in which it is the only language spoken. This is the language that is acquired in the child's formative years. It can be just as difficult to teach a native speaker of Ebonics to use Proper English as it may be to teach a native speaker of Spanish. This is what I'm really getting at: education is the key.\n \n \nWe have to have some standards, and ultimately this is about what the standards are and what they are not.\n\n \n I never asked anybody to redefine their \"standards\", whatever you mean by that. All I did was try to point out people's gross misconceptions and reactionary thinking, and perhaps help give people a better understanding of what Black English really is. But I am by no means an expert on the subject, so I would highly recommend anybody who is even a little bit interested to go find more literature on the subject. \n \n \nThere aren't really very many differences between basic American english and the english spoken in England (a very few differences in vocabulary). That's what society considers the standard for English. The geographical areas you mention mostly stay with it as well, except in accent. Ebonics is a very radical departure from it.\n\n \n I would seriously beg to differ. I gave two examples of dialects of English that I would expect nearly any speaker of American English to have difficulty comprehending: Scots, and that of the Tangiermen. Scots is remarkably different, and this site: http://www.scots-online.org/ even has a Scots to English dictionary. The Tangiermen, who live on an island off the coast of Virginia, speak what is described as Elizabethan English. I'm sure if you heard it, you'd be just as clueless about what they're saying as I was when I heard it.\n \n Once again, my point is that Black English is something that people should try to understand, and not just write it off as a \"bastardization of English\" as I've heard so many times before. Teachers need to be taught to recognize the difference between a student who has a learning disability and one who speaks a different dialect. And people need to get over the stigma associated with the way other people talk.",

You just showed me that you think one way of talking is better than another way of talking. How is that not a value judgement? I'm not pretending it's something it's not. And neither are the hundreds of sociolinguists who've been researching Black English for decades. I can't believe you'd actually want to see \"causal realationships\" after all of the data that's been presented to you. You can deny that it has structure, definition, or rules, but the data contradicts that claim. It's the scientific method. You can test the data yourself. Record (by which I mean just write down) some data from speakers of Black English, either what you encounter in the media or maybe people you know. Test it with the features I've presented here. The results should match up pretty well. The phonological and grammatical features of Black English remain mostly constant. It's not just one article, it's countless publications. Here's some more data: \n \n http://www.rehabmed.ualberta.ca/spa/phonology/features.htm\n (some of this is kind of technical)\n \n Here's some of several books on the subject:\n \n African-American English; Structure, History and Use\n The English History of African American English (Language in Society)\n The Historical Evolution of Earlier African American English: An Empirical Comparison of Early Sources\n \n So you, with (I'm guessing) no experience in the field of linguistics whatsoever, is going to write off decades of research by countless scientists because I haven't shown you \"causal relationships\"?

No matter what ebonics is, at the end of the day, it would be more worthwhile in our society for people to learn to speak good english.\n\n \n That's what I've said twice now! Programs need to be implemented that will allow children to transition from speaking Black English to speaking Standard English, so that children aren't left behind. I'll say it again: Teachers need to be taught to recognize the difference between a student who has a learning disability and one who speaks a different dialect.

My company uses two outsourcing agencies and the majority of the folks I work with are highly, trained, hard working, and very knowledgable. Sometimes the accent is a little thick. I have a friend from India - she tells most middle to upper class Indians schools taught in English - it is the language of instruction there.\n \n Out-tasking is such a hard issue. I hate to see job-loss, but long for a world with better global ties and understanding. I can't love or hate it - I am torn.",

   "I've had no communication problems using offshore help desks. And they do use technical level scripts, just as do those help desks still located in the US. A majority of problems are solved at the first script level. If not, a caller is routed to the next technical level. \n \n I've posted before that one of the largest US companies uses Mexico for their accounts receivable operations because of lower costs and efficiency. And if you're calling your credit card company and hit Spanish in the voice mail option you more than likely won't be directed to a US customer service center. \n \n Those who think US companies relocate services or facilities offshore for higher margins obviously don't have a clue as to what's happening in the world of commerce. I suggest they study the highly publicized problems of Ford, GM, Delphi and others for enlightenment.",

   "trebor: Weather it is an indian help desk for computers , or programers, they, in my experiance, have been very consistantly bad.\n\n \n The potentially poor abilities of the Indian personnel is important to the consumer, but whether the Indians are retarded or geniuses, what really hurts us programmers is the fact that the Indians are taking HIGH PAYING, PROFESSIONAL jobs away from Americans. \n \n Computer programming is not some unskilled labor that someone picks up in a week. I spent my 4 years and $30K (or whatever) in college in order to get my BS in CIS, and the field requires constant study to keep pace with advancement in the field.\n \n Offshoring jobs (such as to India) started with the more unskilled, manual-labor jobs: manufacturing and assembly. Then it moved up a notch to more intellectual jobs, such as help desk positions. Then it moved up into the real professional jobs by moving computer programming jobs to foreign countries. And now it has gone even higher by shipping very high skill jobs - pharmaceutical and other science and science-related research and development - offshore. \n \n To save some bucks now, businesses are handing over our jobs - even some of our very best ones - to foreign countries. They are too shortsighted to see what impace this will have on our economy and workforce. Either it will bleed us dry, or, to try to retain jobs here - to compete with India - we'll have to lower our own wages to the level of India. And how the hell will the latter work? Are you really going to have someone in the US pay $50K or $75K to go get a BS, Masters, or Ph.D., only to earn $7.50 an hour?",

The US standard of living will have to come down, it already is with wage stagnation and inflation, as we move closer to a two-tiered society within a service economy in a global society. I don't know India's projections, but China has targeted $20k (USD) per-capita income by 2021, less than half of the present US per-capita income. And they're certainly churning out the degrees, as is India, for presently low wage scales.",

Right now, the effects aren't very noticeable, but if it continues, it will be catastrophic. It's kind of like having a pyramid of cans and removing some from the bottom and middle areas: the pyramid remains in tact. But you are still undermining its stability and it takes less external force to topple the whole thing. At some critical point, simply removing a single can will cause the entire pyramid to come crashing to the ground.",
