   "What about it? Are you saying there exists a liberal who is intolerant? All liberals are intolerant? More intolerant compared to conservatives? Or are you just complaining about it in general, without relationship to anything else? Give us a whole statement here, not just a sentence fragment.\n\n \n I'm saying some liberals (instead of just conservatives) can be intolerant at times. Now you can take the high road here and simply say you agree (assuming you do), or not take the high road and stroke whatever need you may have to question my \"integrity\" for saying it, or character, or claim it has to be proven when it doesn't need to be, or quibble, or whatever else the tactic-of-the-moment is. so what's it gonna be? Do you have it in you to actually simply say \"ok, I agree\" and leave it at that?\n \n \nReally? Seems to me that only happens when I'm talking with you, while it seems to happen to you all the time. For example, remember that thread in the religion forum? The one where I was talking with EF and you got all bent out of shape, and I asked you to refrain from posting? Go take a look at how it progressed with you not contributing.\n\n \n LOL, I don't even remember you asking me not to post. Rest assured if I stopped, it wasn't because you asked me to. But regardless of what happened after I left, that's unrelated to arguing from ad hominem as I'm talking about you doing. You've now done the same thing to Steeeeve here. If you just argue the issue rather than resorting to ad hominem by making comments about character and publically implying issues about integrity, you'd be doing fine. But you apparently feel you have to cross that line.\n \n \nI'm pretty sure you're the only one who reports people for asking them to debate honestly.\n\n \n Well, you're the only person I've EVER reported for anything in these forums, and that was for dishonesty and continued badgering, FWIW.\n \n \nThe admins have asked me to report your lies rather than trying to correct you myself, but I admit sometimes I can't resist.\n\n \n I suspect it's more simply because, since I haven't lied, you have no way to prove it to the admin.",

Saying something mean during an invited speech is fine...that is what Ann Coulter does...but this doesn't give reason to throw a pie which is not invited. It is as if you think Ann Coulter is going to stand up and start preaching how we all gotta get along...everyone knew what she would say. This makes it not disrespectful, although it might hurt your feelings, but rather just speech. Same thing with Justice Scalia, while he was speaking you don't need to interupt even if you think he speech is \"disrespectful\"...no one invited you to sit in there and heckle the judge. The only times you see conservatives, for the most part, being \"disrespectful\" is in the proper forums such as invited speeches or TV shows or other invited means. Liberals have shown an increasing trend in things like pie throwing or just interupting during speeches, etc...things I just don't see from the other side.

IE, if I were to launch a constant public campaign of verbal abuse and defamation against you personally (based largely on half truths and generalizations to boot) it would be far more damaging than if I simply threw a pie at you or walked by and sucker punched you.\n \n IMHO, verbal assault, and even worse, the kind of \"hate mongering\" that often goes hand in hand with these speeches and speakers, can potentially lead to an equal amount of harm being done to both people, and society in general, than a pie in the face, both are equally disrespectful, and both are equally assinine.\n \n Giving someone a pass, or somehow downgrading their actions because they are verbal rather than physical, \"so they aren't that big of a deal in comparison\" is completely unacceptable IMHO. The pen indeed can be more powerful than the sword.\n \n \n\"Standing at a podium at a specified time and place automatically make the speaker and the speech respectful, regardless of the content\" because they were either invited to be there or paid to be there. The audience is there because they expect to hear what the person standing at the podium has to say, not some heckler in the crowd or piethrower.\n\n \n I just don't understand how inviting or paying someone to speak gives them a free pass on the content of their speech, or the right to be intentionally disrespectful. The person at the podium is free to speak, and those in the audience are free to come and go, but disrespect on the part of the speaker is still disrespect, regardless of the situation. Perhaps you can explain why you feel otherwise?\n \n They cancel out IMHO, disrespect is disrespect, and both actions are disrespectful. IMHO, one is no more disrespectful than the other, and I believe you'd have a hard time making a case to the contrary.\n \n \nNo, it isn't more disrespectful to stand in front of an audience and be rude and disrespectful while \"speaking your mind\" than it is to interrupt that speech? Again, the audience, whether you agree with the speaker's views or not, is there to hear what he/she has to say. They didn't come to watch a Jerry Springer moment. \n\n \n You seem to be intentionally blind to the fact that that regardless of who the audience is, or whether or not I agree with the speaker, the speech is still disrespectful. A person can \"speak their mind\" without being disrespectful. \n \n My point here is not that interrupting the speech is not disrespectful, of course it is, and two wrongs don't make a right. My point is simply that if the speech itself is disrespectful, regardless of time, place, or audience, then how is that form of disrespect somehow OK, while the other form of disrespect (interuptions) is not, or is somehow worse? \n \n IMHO, you're playing a rather random game of defining disrespect to suit your cause.\n \n Waxy",

The person at the podium is free to speak, and those in the audience are free to come and go, but disrespect on the part of the speaker is still disrespect, regardless of the situation.
