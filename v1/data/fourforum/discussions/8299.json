   "credits to Tom Keske...\n \n In newspaper reports, GOP conservatives describe themselves as \"boiling\" in their anger over the delays in getting more far-right judges appointed to federal courts. They are outraged over liberal \"activist\" judges, particularly the judges in Massachusetts who started the gay marriage controversy.\n \n Time for a bit of a reality check, here. Who has the real grievances with the state of things in our court system?\n \n Judges and courtrooms, as seen through gay eyes:\n \n Let's start with the Dan White trial. An entire 5 years in prison for pre-mediated double murder. The primary reason for the obscenely light sentence was the fact that a heterosexual, Irish Catholic had murdered a gay man, the fact of which was apparently enough to get him off the hook for also murdering the mayor of San Francisco. The defendant offered his infamous \"Twinkie Defense\", claiming that his judgment was impaired by too much junk food. The jury, instead of being repelled, literally wept for the murderer.\n \n Then there was the Sharon Bottoms trial in Virginia: a child snatched from the very arms of a mother, by the power of the state, not because of any divorce proceedings, not because of any alleged abuse, but simply because the woman was a lesbian. Never did that outrageous miscarriage of justice produce any show of real conscience from America.\n \n In Alabama, the \"Ten Commandments\" judge, Roy Moore, said that gays were \"indescribably evil\" and a danger to children. He went on to hint that capital punishment for gays would be the state's prerogative .\n \n In Mississippi, a judge complained bitterly about the fact that a California woman had been able to sue in federal court for damages, like a family member, after her life-partner had been killed in a pit bull attack. Said the judge, \"It makes me sick to my stomach\", to think that the woman had legal right to sue. Apparently, it did not make the judge sick to his stomach that a lesbian woman had been killed by a pit bull, or that he was talking about the bereaved partner.\n \n In Kansas, judges gave an extra 16 years in prison to an 18 year-old gay youth, in a \"Romeo and Juliet\" case of consensual sex between two youths, who were all of 2 years different in age. A heterosexual youth would have received less than a year in prison, in an identical situation. The judges openly admitted that the extra 16 years in prison was simply because the youth is gay. They claim to be proud of this decision, as way for the state of Kansas to \"make a statement\" about \"moral values\". Again, the straight, mainstream press has barely even mentioned this outrageous case. \n \n ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n In the state of Texas, gays had to listen to a judge's pronouncement that \"Killing a gay man is like killing a prostitute. I cannot conceive of giving as harsh of a sentence.\" In another trial, a bailiff joked that raping a lesbian should be a misdemeanor.\n \n Adding to this context is the official platform of the Texas GOP, which demands the return of criminal penalties for sodomy. Gay sexuality, says the platform, \"tears at the fabric of society.\" It goes on to say that gays should automatically be denied custody of children in divorce cases, and that even visitation rights should be allowed only if supervised.\n \n This is the party platform in the state that gave us our President, who is now busily stuffing the courts with lifetime appointments, as far to the right as possible.\n \n Federal judge nominee William Pryor is on record, saying that decriminalizing gay sexuality would require also decriminalizing sex with animals, or sex with dead bodies, or sex with children. It is obvious enough that this \"logic\" makes sense to Pryor, only because to him, gays are roughly on a par with animals, necrophiliacs and pedophiles.\n \n Could gay Americans have any real expectation of justice from a man with such attitudes?\n \n Pryor justifies his statement by pointing out how similar anti-gay language has been used before, even in the Supreme Court. To him, that is a justifying precedent, rather than an intolerable context, making it even more essential to keep someone with his attitudes off the federal bench. \n \n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n To be sure, President Bush's good friend, Antonin Scalia, an anti-gay Catholic, was positively outraged when his \"liberal\" colleagues, (who are really right-of-center, themselves) had decided that gays as a class should not be treated as criminals. There seems to be a low level of awareness in the gay community that there is every reason to fear that the one, nearly the only, significant piece of progress that we ever got from the nation's courts, might now be overturned, as the High Court itself is stuffed with more characters like Scalia.\n \n Perhaps we will return to the bad-old-days, such as the scene during the Bowers-vs-Hardwick trial- the first attempt to overturn sodomy laws.\n \n A \"friend of the court\" brief had been filed by a Dr. Paul Cameron, a man who has called gays \"feces eaters\" and has openly suggested exterminating gay men. This is not hyperbole or figurative- it is literal. The media's reaction to the thought of Dr. Paul Cameron in the United States Supreme Court, was not bothering even to mention it. \n \n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n The Supreme Court Justices laughed at gays, made anti-gay jokes, quoted Leviticus from the Bible, which also, incidentally calls for death of gays. The Justices said that gays must be \"facetious\" to think that the Constitution would protect them. They cited ancient Roman death penalties, as part of the \"millennia of moral wisdom\" to justify the treatment of gays as criminals.\n \n The Chief Justice at the time, Warren Burger, scoffed \"Homosexuality? Didn't they used to put people to death for that?\"\n \n When Burger died, the media and even the supposedly \"liberal\" Bill Clinton, obscenely fawned over him and his \"progressive\" record.\n \n Far and wide throughout our country, gays have little or no reason to expect justice from the courts. The whining of conservatives is utterly pathetic and spoiled, in context. The attention showered by the media on the complaints of conservatives only shows how upside-down the entire picture has become.\n http://talkaboutgovernment.com/group/alt.politics.org.nsa/messages/16774.html\n \n (There are a few more paragraphs available at the web-site which I have cut for an attempt at brevity...)",

Our founding fathers realized that it would be dangerous to pretend that they could list out precisely what rights we were and were not guaranteed.\n...so we have unelected people decide them...this is exactly what the federalist papers didn't want. \n \n Nevertheless, thats not even what that amendment says. It says the list of rights in the constitution (as in the ones that already exist there) can't be used to deny the other rights retained by the people. If you say \"marriage is not in the constitution\", you aren't using any right in the constitution to deny someone a right retained. The rights you personally retain are determined in the next amendment. Therefore this amendment isn't protecteing any rights really...other than saying a right ALREADY IN THE CONSTITUTION can't be used to deny this other right. Perhaps there might be something to people construing the constitution to take away the right to life of a fetus.",

Almost ALL civil rights (the major issues anyway) have been changed and granted by amendments and Acts.

   "It is simple if you don't follow a living constitution. Marriage, abortion, and homosexual sodemy are no where in the constitution.\n\n It's funny how often conversations get off track...\n Like this one. It started out by talking about activist judges. Judges who made rulings that were not based on law, but their personal opinions. I have frequently made that observation in this thread, but to no avail. I don't believe Jyoshu or Steeeeve have made any comment about the judges LEGAL BASIS for why they ruled the way they did, or even if there was one...\n \n And the conversation has devolved into NOT talking about how they made rulings not based on law, but rather in how others have supposedly done so. Pointing the finger at Peter to ignore Paul...\n \n \n \nIf you are a living constitutionalist it is a rather difficult question. You consently have to ask yourself \"what would others like\" or \"what would I like\". For example, affirmative action is \"constitutional\" now...but (as the opinion states) it might not be later...we don't know! The only legal document in history to morph at the whim of unelected people.\n\n 1) You misrepresent their approach. They do not approach things with \"what would others like\" or \"what would I like\".\n There are legal concepts involved in these decisions. Legal concepts you obviously don't agree with.\n But it does a disservice for you to misrepresent the ACTUAL arguments involved.\n 2) Regarding \"unelected\", polls showed that the vast majority of the public DID NOT want sodomy laws. A vast majority in this country do want some form of abortion. And I bet dollars to doughnuts that while they may not want gay marriage recognized as a right, they DO want their heterosexual marriages recognized as rights.\n \n \n \nThis makes no sense. Women got most of their rights (get this) by the LEGISLATIVE BRANCH. Blacks on the back of the bus? Same thing! Interracial marriage...while many states had passed laws to allow it...the courts applied the 14th amendment which is very clear that you can't base those kinds of things on race.\n\n Maybe you can show me where the 14th amendment specifies race.\n Or slavery issues.\n I'll give you a hint. It doesn't.\n They INTENTIONALLY left it vague so that it could be applied to MORE than just racial issues.\n \n And I don't see HOW you can pretend that the \"interracial marriage\" issue is affected by the 14th amendment when you remove so many essentials from the Loving v Virginia ruling in the first place.\n One of the basis of Loving v Virginia was that marriage IS A RIGHT. It was the cornerstone of their ruling. A cornerstone you wipe away.\n Another argument you pose is that the state has the right to legislate marriage. How do you reconcile this insistence with the Loving v Virginia ruling? The state WAS legislating marriage by preventing interracial marriage.\n Ergo, weren't they within their rights?\n Hopefully you can explain WHY you think the conclusion of Loving v Virginia is valid, while keeping it consistent with your other arguments. This is something I would sincerely like to see...\n \n \n \nYou shouldn't have the idea that if the constitution doesn't say it than it can't be changed.\n\n 1) I don't understand what you mean by this statement. I don't have that idea, unless I am misinterpreting you.\n 2) You shouldn't have the idea that if the constitution doesn't say something is a right, then that means it isn't a right. The 9th amendment explicitly establishes that the rights of this nation are not explicitly and exclusively enumerated in the constitution.\n \n \n \n...so we have unelected people decide them...this is exactly what the federalist papers didn't want. \n\n Care to elaborate?\n \n \n \nNevertheless, thats not even what that amendment says. It says the list of rights in the constitution (as in the ones that already exist there) can't be used to deny the other rights retained by the people. If you say \"marriage is not in the constitution\", you aren't using any right in the constitution to deny someone a right retained.\n\n Except, marriage IS a right retained ...\n Your interpretation moots any real effectiveness of the 9th amendment. It makes it essentially meaningless.\n By your statement, we could say \"Marriage is not in the constitution, and thus not a right. Because this doesn't deny somebody the right to vote, or other rights listed in the constitution, it is perfectly fine\". (If my interpretation of your argument is wrong, correct me)\n This interpretation is meaningless.\n How would you actually apply the 9th amendment AS IT IS to actually mean something?\n \n The only way it has meaning is in conjunction with OTHER IDEALS in our founding fathers documents. \n \"\"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with inherent and inalienable rights; that among these, are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed...\"\n \n \n \nThe rights you personally retain are determined in the next amendment.\n\n Your interpretation makes the separation between the 9th and the 10th amendment meaningless.\n Why aren't they both just ONE amendment then?\n They both stand alone. They both have meaning on their own.\n \n \n \nTherefore this amendment isn't protecteing any rights really...other than saying a right ALREADY IN THE CONSTITUTION can't be used to deny this other right.\n\n You keep using subtle word substitutions to destroy the meaning.\n The constitution actually says \"others retained by the people\". Plural.\n By your interpretation, it would be more effective to state \"any other right listed in the constitution\".\n But our founding father referred to OTHERS. Other rightS.\n \n The funny thing is that the founding fathers were EXPLICITLY SAYING that there were other \"enumerated\" rights. And then, in the SAME SENTENCE, they refer to OTHERS retained by the people.\n This is another area where your misinterpretation grossly abuses the English language. If our founding fathers were referring to the rights ALREADY ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL LIST, they would NOT have used the word \"OTHERS\".\n \n Your interpretation makes no sense. It's like saying \"I have a group of apples here, and then I have others\", and then pretending that the person is talking about ONLY ONE group of apples.\n \n Your interpretation makes no sense. The word \"others\" MEANS OTHERS. Not the same set...\n Other RIGHTS. Not the same list of \"enumerated\" rights...\n \n \n \nPerhaps there might be something to people construing the constitution to take away the right to life of a fetus.\n\n 1) Your interpretation is easily refuted by looking at REAL issues.\n There are a variety of ways in which the constitutional rights DO conflict with each other.\n Right to free speech: Shouting fire in a crowded theater.\n Interest of safety: Preventing chaos in the theater which could harm another person.\n \n Obviously, one of those rights HAS to win.\n \n 2) This assumes that an embryo has a \"right to life\" in the first place...\n Does an embryo have a right to unreasonable search and seizure? Fifth amendment protections?\n You're really reaching in attempting to misapply the 9th amendment in this manner. And I welcome you to show me a FOUNDING FATHERS example (not a modern misapplication by you) as to how the FOUNDING FATHERS thought the 9th amendment would be applied.",

   "When the federal Constitution was written the wisest minds in America decided that there should be no national Bill of Rights, not merely because most of the state constitutions already contained some such protections, but, as Madison (who would later write the federal Bill of Rights) said, 'There is a great reason to fear that a positive declaration of some of the most essential rights could not be obtained in the requisite latitude.' In other words, the enumeration of rights by the federal government, the mere listing of them and defining them, would necessarily limit their scope. 'The rights of conscience in particular [he said], if submitted to public definition, would be narrowed more than they are likely ever to be by an assumed power.' The right solution, he and others then felt, was what is implied in the present 9th Amendment: that, in addition to the rights specified by the states, there is a universe of rights, possessed by the people latent rights, still to be evoked and enacted into law.-- Dr. Bernard Bailyn, Harvard historian, remarks at White House Millenium Evening\n http://clinton2.nara.gov/Initiatives/Millennium/bbailyn.html",

The majority of the opinion was on equal protection...I guess we have a different definition of fundamental.\n \n \nThe \"point\" you \"find\" is when there is a LEGITIMATE STATE INTEREST for restricting the right.\n And \"not always easy to find\" typically involves a point that you and I may not agree with. But just because we don't agree with it doesn't mean the rationale rests on \"whatever the judge feels like\".\n Legitimate State interest is fine but what is more legitimate then a state making a law that their citizens want?\n \n \n \n \n\"Legislative history\"???\n \"Legislative history\" indicates that the Congress that passed the 14th amendment DID NOT WANT it to be used against interracial marriage.\n \"The State argues that statements in the Thirty-ninth Congress about the time of the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment indicate that the Framers did not intend the Amendment to make unconstitutional state miscegenation laws.\"\n \n If you want to go with \"founding fathers\" and \"intent of the framers\", you are shooting yourself in the foot.\n So why the inconsistency?\n Why do we listen to the framers on some issues, but not on this interracial marriage?\n Sorry I meant Judicial history there. Neither the less, legislative history is a good tool to use to find the orginial meaning of the text.\n \n \nAre you under the impression that there are some rights which are \"protected by the constitution\", and some rights which aren't \"protected by the constitution\"?\n If you are, PROVE IT.\n Give examples along with legal precedent.\n Yes! To think otherwise is insane. Do you have a right to use the internet? If so, who created that right? Your argument is that everything can be a right and that when a state makes a law against it you have to pass the judicial test in order to keep that law...in other words, convince the judges it was a good idea. This is exactly what the framers DIDN'T WANT and the anti-federalists feared...and actually a reason they created the 9th and 10th amendment.\n \n \nAgain, you are making up legal standards which just plain don't exist.\n The \"doesn't say they are protected by the constitution\" is an inane claim.\n What do you think the point is with the constitution ACKNOWLEDGING the EXISTENCE of a right, but then making NO PROTECTIONS upon that right.\n The point of this was so the federal government doesn't assume the right. Did you bother to read that article I linked to?\n \n \nIrrelevant, unless you're prepared to show legal precedent for this distinction between \"constitutional rights\" and rights not explicitly listed in the constitution.\n Counter-case in point. Loving v Virginia. A case where we have a right, marriage, that is not explicitly listed in the constitution, but the court EXPLICITLY STATES that the constitution protects it via the 14th amendment.\nI'm saying that is wrong. There is no basis for determining which rights are covered under the 14th (or in your case the 9th) amendment other than a judges whim.\n \n\n Your dodging my point.\n Your stated interpretation makes the fact that the 9th and the 10th amendment are SEPARATE amendments meaningless. Your interpretation of the 9th REQUIRES the 10th, and IS NOT APPLICABLE without the 10th.\n A logical course of action in such a case is to make ONE amendment with multiple sentences.\n The fact that the framers made TWO amendments, each with separate meanings just like the REST of the amendments, is significant.\n But they are related and were one amendment at one draft. The article linked explains this. I urge you to read it. The 9th amendment was a judicial interpretation amendment much like the 11th. \n \n \nIt's amazing how you keep trying to change the wording to be something IT IS NOT.\n I underlined and red-faced what you CLAIMED is said.\n It's not. It says \"others retained by the people\".\n Not \"those retained by the people\", which could imply the same set.\n It says OTHERS retained by the people. A DIFFERENT set of rights.\n \n The funny thing is that the founding fathers were EXPLICITLY SAYING that there were other \"enumerated\" rights. And then, in the SAME SENTENCE, they refer to OTHERS retained by the people.\n This is another area where your misinterpretation grossly abuses the English language. If our founding fathers were referring to the rights ALREADY ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL LIST, they would NOT have used the word \"OTHERS\".\n \n Your interpretation makes no sense. It's like saying \"I have a group of apples here, and then I have others\", and then pretending that the person is talking about ONLY ONE group of apples.\n \n Your interpretation makes no sense. The word \"others\" MEANS OTHERS. Not the same set...\n Other RIGHTS. Not the same list of \"enumerated\" rights...\n \n It says THE ENUMERATION of those rights. Grammatically, ENUMERATION is the noun which \"shall not be construed to deny or disparage\" the OTHER rights of the people.\n \n Your interpretation makes no sense to what they ACTUALLY said. Dissecting the phrase according to an English graph, the meaning is clear. But you claim that the preposition is the noun, and then you claim that one word is the same as a different word, when they have different and distinct meanings.\n \n Quit trying to rewrite the 9th amendment so the meaning of the word \"others\" is eliminated.\n Can you make a reply to this point which doesn't try to improperly substitute a word in for \"others\"?\n\n \n I don't understand why you can't get this concept. Read the link sent (which you didn't comment on and then it might make more sense).\n \n The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\n \n Enumeration means list....it isn't special. The amendment just says you can't use the constitutional rights to deny or disparage the rights retained by the people. Nothing more, its a judicial interpretation amendment like the 11th. I'm not saying other rights don't exist....I am saying they are constitutional rights and this amendment even addresses that point.\n \n Your explanation makes no sense and you keep on trying to say \"enumeration\" is some awesome word...it just means lists. What list? The list in the constitution...of certain rights. The others means there are other rights...but they aren't on that list and thus not a constitutional right.\n \n Seriously, read that arcticle...I even directed you to where to go. I'm not rewritting anything, just focusing on what Madison said. What other source would you use?",

   "in general. How would a constitution evolve outside of the amendment process. Surely you know how the living constitution theory goes.\n\n No. Not in general.\n When I talk in general, you start taking bits and pieces of my conversation and confusing what I am saying.\n Ergo, I want to discuss this in specifics, and with a specific example.\n \n \n \nIt is...but what are the \"self-eviden\" rights? I think yours are different from mine....this doesn't mean they don't exist...just we have different opinions on that.\n\n Is this a rhetorical question?\n Because in many ways, you are reaffirming my position.\n \n \n \nIt is not false. Since then we have an \"intermediate scrutiny\" ....\n\n And another example of where you are confused.\n The context of my statement should have made it clear that the \"falsehood\" was your claim of \"whatever the judge feels like\". THAT is the falsehood.\n \n I whole-heartedly acknowledge that strict scrutiny, and rational review exist.\n In fact, MY RESPONSE ACKNOWLEDGED their existence when I explicitly stated: \n\"Judges still stick with the \"strict scrutiny\" and \"rational review\" standards.\n If you could actually show a ruling that uses \"whatever the judge feels like\", it would be a start.\"\n\n \n With that said, can you show an actual ruling that uses \"whatever the judge feels like\"?\n \n \n \nI suspect you would just deny this is what happened but there is nothing cleraly then the advancement of different tests that apply to different things.\n\n You \"suspect\" falsely.\n Your confusion and inaccurate interpretation of that reply is a further demonstration of your claims of \"contradiction\" regarding my statements.\n \n \n \nThe \"last\" paragraph, because you want to skip over statements like THIS: \"We have consistently denied the constitutionality of measures which restrict the rights of citizens on account of race.\" \n\n \nThis quote dealt with the equal protection arguement mainly. \n\n Yes. The Equal Protection argument WHICH IS FOUNDED ON RIGHTS.\n It discusses the FUNCTION of the equal protection argument. The equal protection argument, in general, deals with the rights of the citizens and attempts to restrict them.\n \n THIS case was about race.\n \n \n \nI've quoted it before...it wasn't fundamental to the case...it was the last paragraph where they stick in the fact that they felt it was under the word \"liberty\" in the 14th amendment. The majority of the opinion was on equal protection...I guess we have a different definition of fundamental.\n\n As usual, you are attempting to muddle the issue.\n The fact that marriage was a right WAS fundamental to the case. You don't seem to realize that the word \"right\" was a PART OF \"liberty\". Notice how they use the concept interchangeably, and how they flow inbetween acknowledging it is a RIGHT, and the use of the word \"liberty\"...\n \n \"These statutes also deprive the Lovings of liberty without due process of law in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men. \n Marriage is one of the \"basic civil rights of man,\" fundamental to our very existence and survival. Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535, 541 (1942). See also Maynard v. Hill, 125 U.S. 190 (1888). To deny this fundamental freedom on so unsupportable a basis as the racial classifications embodied in these statutes, classifications so directly subversive of the principle of equality at the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment, is surely to deprive all the State's citizens of liberty without due process of law. The Fourteenth Amendment requires that the freedom of choice to marry not be restricted by invidious racial discriminations. Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State. \"\n \n Notice that there are seven sentences in the final section. A whopping THREE of those sentences deal with the fact that marriage is a right. TWICE they state that marriage is a right, demonstrating the vast importance of that fact to this ruling. TWICE they give substantiation to the fact that marriage is a right.\n \n All that effort spent on a concept that you feel isn't fundamental?\n Actually READING the ruling's conclusion, I don't see how anybody can't come away realizing that it is one of the more fundamental parts of the ruling.\n \n \n \nLegitimate State interest is fine but what is more legitimate then a state making a law that their citizens want?\n\n In which case, MISCEGENATION LAWS WOULD STAND.\n You don't seem to realize that if you make just \"citizens want\" as a legitimate state interest, EVERY LEGISLATION WOULD BE LEGITIMATE.\n Miscegenation laws were voted in with an overwhelming majority, sometimes instituted into the state's constitution. At the time of Loving v Virginia, a whopping 3 to 1 margin felt that marriage should just be man and woman of the same race.\n \n If what you describe is a legitimate state interest, can you name me ANY SCOTUS case which has ruled against legislation on grounds of lacking legitimate state interest which would still be unconstitutional???\n \n I've said this before. Simple majority approval IS NOT a legitimate state interest. Proven so by a variety of rulings I have quoted in the past.\n \n \n \nSorry I meant Judicial history there. Neither the less, legislative history is a good tool to use to find the orginial meaning of the text.\n\n So the original meaning of the text, from legislative history, was to allow miscegenation laws.\n What \"judicial history\" are you referring to?\n \n \n \nYes! To think otherwise is insane. Do you have a right to use the internet? If so, who created that right?\n\n No. I don't believe I have such a \"right\".\n Certain \"rights\" may be invoked in internet usage, but the use of the internet, in and of itself, is not what I would consider a \"right\".\n \n \n \nYour argument is that everything can be a right and that when a state makes a law against it you have to pass the judicial test in order to keep that law...in other words, convince the judges it was a good idea.\n\n And again, Steeeeve is taking us down the road of misrepresenting his opponent's arguments.\n No. My argument IS NOT that everything can be a right.\n \n \n \nThis is exactly what the framers DIDN'T WANT and the anti-federalists feared...and actually a reason they created the 9th and 10th amendment.\n\n So you keep claiming...\n MrWriteLA quoted some actual 9th amendment interpretations / statements.\n You have given me a link to a 70+ page document, which you allege supports you...\n \n \n \nThe point of this was so the federal government doesn't assume the right. Did you bother to read that article I linked to?\n\n I will admit I haven't had time to get to the article yet.\n I have a standing policy that I don't read \"blind\" links whereby somebody just tosses a link out there without quoting it. I will make an exception in this case, and get to it later.\n \n \n \nI'm saying that is wrong.\n\n Say \"that is wrong\" all you like.\n That is what Loving v Virginia did.\n \n And you have yet to provide a counter example.\n Steeeeve, you need to show legal precedent for this distinction between \"constitutional rights\" and rights not explicitly listed in the constitution.\n \n \n \nThere is no basis for determining which rights are covered under the 14th (or in your case the 9th) amendment other than a judges whim.\n\n There is a simple solution.\n ALL rights are covered under the 14th amendment.\n And your placement of the \"9th\" into that statement is nonsensical. That is not my case.\n \n \n \n But they are related and were one amendment at one draft.\n\n But not at the final revision. And you completely disregard this, along with other relevant grammatical argument I have placed forward.\n Which is more important? A \"draft\" which was discarded? Or the actual final version which was signed?\n \n \n \nI don't understand why you can't get this concept.\n\n I \"get\" the concept Steeeeve.\n The \"concept\" is not the interpretation which is ACTUALLY APPLIED in law today.\n \n \n \nThe enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\n Enumeration means list....it isn't special.\n\n Why did they use the word \"enumeration\"?\n Why not use the words \"constitutional rights\"?\n There is a significant concept here between \"constitutional right\" and \"the enumeration in the constitution, of certain right\".\n The first focuses on the rights in the constitution.\n The second focuses on the fact that they are LISTED in the constitution.\n \n Your interpretation ignores the actual phrasing here. There is a significance which you ignore in your rephrasal.\n \n \n \nThe amendment just says you can't use the constitutional rights to deny or disparage the rights retained by the people.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n You DID IT AGAIN.\n You removed the word \"others\" from your reply, and removed its importance in the phrase.\n It says OTHERS, which implies a DIFFERENT SET of rights OTHER than the rights \"listed\" (to use your word) in the constitution.\n \n You just can't do it.\n You can't use the word \"others\" in your interpretation of the amendment without killing your argument. \n \n \n \nI'm not saying other rights don't exist....I am saying they are constitutional rights and this amendment even addresses that point.\n\n Nice try, but no cigar.\n The word \"others\" is significant IN THE INTERPRETATION.\n This follow-on statement uses the word \"other\", but in a way SEPARATE FROM the amendment itself.\n ROFLMAo!\n You just can't do it!\n \n \n \nYour explanation makes no sense and you keep on trying to say \"enumeration\" is some awesome word...it just means lists.\n\n Fine. Use the word \"list\" instead.\n \n \n \nWhat list? The list in the constitution...of certain rights. The others means there are other rights...but they aren't on that list and thus not a constitutional right.\n\n And thus you are putting a LOT of words into the interpretation which just aren't there.\n \n The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\n \n The ENUMERATION...\n ENUMERATION is the noun. Not \"constitutional rights\".\n The fact that the rights are LISTED in the constitution is the important part.\n \n The enumeration SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED TO DENY OR DISPARAGE...\n \n Just because this list of constitutional rights exists doesn't mean that something else shall be denied...\n But what?\n \n The enumeration shall not be construed to deny or disparage OTHERS RETAINED BY THE PEOPLE.\n \n \"others\", implying something SEPARATE FROM the list.\n \"Others\" what? The context establishes that it's talking about other rights.\n And since the word \"others\" is used, it seems obvious that it's talking about other rights THAT ARE NOT LISTED in the constitution.\n \n It's all there in black and white. Complete with significant meaning.\n \n \n \nSeriously, read that arcticle...I even directed you to where to go. I'm not rewritting anything, just focusing on what Madison said. What other source would you use?\n\n Actual court rulings applying the 9th amendment.\n Like what MrWriteLA stated above.\n Just because \"Madison said\" doesn't mean that his desired political philosophy is actually what is expressed in the constitution.",

   "I have read this case about 4 times and this dissent probably a dozen times now. \n \n The comments you read are also not accurate. He always bases his decisions on what the law says and this is very easy to see in this dissent. Can you show me something in his decisions that are wrong? This is why I don't like the evolving constitution....people start thinking in a policy way instead of appealing the law way. You want judges to say \"hey, that seems unfair so lets change the law\" instead of \"hey, the law says this...sorry...get the law changed\". Your way mixes the legislative and judicial so much that we might as well merge the two branches. You then claim that Scalia is a \"right wing\" guy because he follows what the law says (eventhough he has come out against the \"right wing\" several times). I prefer to have a judge just do his job and not make up what things will mean one day and the redefine it again the next (this obviously applies to statutory law as opposed to common law)\n \n Anyway, I never said he talked about an evolving constitution in the Lawrence case but it is implied it some spots anyway.\n\n \n Judges don't change laws they interpret and/or define where 2 or more parties disagree. A judge doesn't walk into court one day and decide from now on this is the way things are going to be. A case is brought before them, each side has a turn to give their opinion why they are right.

Claiming \"88 pages\" comes across as a refusal to actually discuss the issue, but rather a bluff that you have a good issue.\n \n I mean, I'm arguing about the way the 9th amendment IS and SHOULD BE interpreted.\n And this is the title...\n \"The Lost History of the Ninth Amendment (I): The Lost Original Meaning \"\n \n Ergo, obviously admitting that the 9th amendment is not interpreted.\n Leaning more towards the HISTORY, and claimed \"original meaning\", but obviously admitting that is different from today.\n \n Moving on in the abstract...\n \n \n\"This article presents previously unrecognized evidence regarding the original meaning of the Ninth Amendment. Obscured by the contemporary assumption that the Ninth Amendment is about rights while the Tenth Amendment is about powers, the historical roots of the Ninth Amendment can be found in the state ratification convention demands for a constitutional amendment prohibiting the constructive enlargement of federal power.\"\n\n And this \"prohibiting the constructive enlargement of federal power\" is something that is accomplished in the TENTH amendment today.\n \n Moving on...\n \n \nJames Madison's initial draft of the Ninth Amendment expressly adopted the language suggested by the state conventions and he insisted the final draft expressed the same rule of construction desired by the states.\n\n I'ld say it's safe to say that James's \"desire\" was overruled by the final revision...\n Madison's \"initial draft\" is significantly different from what we have today...\n (I'll post it in a later post...)\n \n \n \nHow the courts apply the 9th amendment is irrelevant if wrong. They are wrong because Madison, who wrote it, explains exactly what it means.\n\n \"Madison, who wrote it\"????\n (To prevent confusion, I am not contesting the fact that Madison was involved in the writing of the 9th amendment. However, the IMPORTANCE of his contribution, and whether or not it gives him exclusive power of interpretation is the issue...)\n \n Madison does NOT own the 9th amendment. He may have written the initial draft, but that draft WAS REJECTED by the people who signed the constitution. It isn't Madison's initial draft, or any other draft, which is the important one. It's the one that was SIGNED, that people argued about and compromised on which is the important version.\n \n The fact that Madison wrote the initial draft does not give him exclusive control over the FINAL VERSION, which is a result of compromise and debate amongst numerous people.\n \n It's like saying that the Democrats wrote legislation on gun control.\n The Republicans work with the Democrats to eliminate some of the Democrat demands in the interest of compromise. They add others to ensure that certain aspects of the legislation are not too liberally interpreted.\n The final version, filled with compromises, gets voted into law.\n \n And then you come along with the law, and insist that we have to look at the Democrats desire for the legislation, ignoring the compromises, and ignoring what the FINAL VERSION actually is.\n \n \n \nThere is no question that the courts are wrong.

   "If you don't want to read that whole article I sent you just look at page 76 (as shown on the paper...77 if you look at the adobe page count) which is Part V\n\n \n Looking at the statements on this page, I can't help but think there is a \"forest for the trees\" moment...\n \n \nBecause so much of the debate over the original meaning of the Ninth Amendment has involved the issue of natural rights, it seems appropriate to close this discussion by considering the relationship of such rights with the Madisonian Federalist reading of the Ninth Amendment. Libertarian scholars have criticized Federalist readings of the Ninth for ignoring the Founders' commitment to protect natural rights.298 In fact, evidence that many Founders embraced the idea of natural rights is broad and deep.299\n Madison himself referred to natural rights in his speech introducing the Bill of Rights.300 Most state constitutions referred to natural rights.301 Prior to the adoption of the Constitution, state courts referred to natural rights, as did some early Supreme Court cases.302 There is no textual reason, and little historical reason to believe that the \"other rights\" of the Ninth Amendment did not include natural rights. But understanding the Founders' embrace of natural rights is not the same thing as understanding the Founders' view of the Ninth Amendment.\n\n \n The bold-faced parts being the key-point, helping to SUBSTANTIATE my point.

And as the last sentence demonstrates, the \"other rights\" ARE INCLUDED in the 9th amendment.\n This all goes to my argument. My argument that the 9th amendment talks about \"other rights\" which aren't included in the constitution. NATURAL rights which we as a people KNOW in our hearts are rights, and don't need to explicitly list them in a constitution to acknowledge their existence.\n \n Now, I ALSO quoted the follow-on sentence, which establishes the TONE of that section. It (along with the context of the previous sentence), IS NOT denying the existence of the \"natural rights\" which I have explicitly said the 9th amendment talks about.\n The follow-on statement talks about the founders' view being BROADER than just natural rights.\n \n Ergo, not EXCLUDING the points I am talking about, but INCLUDING MORE than that.\n And as an additional note, in reading this we MUST NOT blindly assume that the \"perspective\" they talked about and the opinions on the 9th amendment ARE AUTOMATICALLY WHAT WAS SEEN ON THE FINAL DRAFT.\n \n These are perspectives and compromises that were discussed in the fight to WRITING the 9th amendment. These \"perspectives\" are part of the reasons why SOME people thought the 9th amendment was important, but it IS NOT significant to the ACTUAL FINAL VERSION of the 9th amendment.\n \n Continuing on...\n \nThe story of the Ninth clearly moved along the lines of a rule of construction protecting the autonomy of local government. The evidence in this regard is as broad and deep as evidence regarding natural rights. How then are we to reconcile natural rights with the historical Ninth Amendment?\n\n \n Note the word HISTORICAL 9th amendment here.\n The author frequently adds in adjectives and qualifiers to his discussion of the 9th amendment. He talks about the DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES (not just Madison) which went into the 9th amendment. The HISTORY of the different views on the 9th amendment.\n \n Now, keeping the last quoted section in mind, let's compare Madison's ORIGINAL 9th amendment to the FINAL version which was actually signed...\n \n \nThe exceptions [to power] here or elsewhere in the constitution made in favor of particular rights, shall not be so construed as to diminish the just importance of other rights retained by the people, or as to enlarge the powers delegated by the constitution; but either as actual limitations on such powers, or as inserted merely for greater caution.\n\n \n \nThe enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. \n\n \n Notice the GLARING difference here...\n The ACTUALLY ratified 9th amendment version DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY MENTION of \"powers\" of the government. It focuses SOLELY and EXCLUSIVELY on an issue that is mentioned earlier in the article. NATURAL RIGHTS.\n In Madison's version, the amendment discusses the \"powers\" of the government, in addition to the subject of the rights.\n In the FINAL VERSION, the focus is JUST on the RIGHTS.\n This, in and of itself, should demonstrate that the focus of Madison's version is significantly different from the focus of the FINAL version, which our founding fathers actually signed.\n \n So, while Madison wanted the 9th amendment to include MORE than it actually does...\n Despite the fact that many wanted the 9th amendment to include statements on governmental \"powers\"...\n Despite the history of the push and pull that went into the making of the FINAL DRAFT of the 9th amendment...\n \n What REALLY matters is what the 9th amendment ACTUALLY SAYS.\n \n \n Moving a bit further...\n \nThe Ninth and Tenth Amendments drew and maintained the boundary\n between the jurisdictions of federal and local authorities. This line can be perceived in other amendments as well. For example, it is Congress that \"shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,\" not the states. The states continued to establish religion for a great many years after the adoption of the Bill of Rights.303\n The concern animating the Bill was how to limit federal power without\n simultaneously suggesting that federal authority reached all matters not expressly prohibited. Such a reading would swamp the rights of the people to decide on a local level how they wished to approach \"natural rights\" such as freedom of speech. While this kind of \"home rule\" approach to individual liberty may seem strange to us, it was a matter of first principles to the Founders\n\n You'll notice something SERIOUSLY out of date here.\n An interpretation of the 9th and 10th amendment as giving the states a PASS at having to recognize the rights established by the constitution. That the rights of the constitution are something for the STATE to legislate and not the federal government.\n \n It's out-dated because of the 14th amendment which clearly establishes that the rights of the constitution which require the federal government to protect them ALSO include application of protection with the state government.\n Before, the first amendment established a right to free speech that CONGRESS could not abridge.\n After the 14th amendment, the first amendment right to free speech could not be abridged by EITHER the federal or the state government.",

   "All the way from Chicago I will respond to part of your post.\n \n First off you cherry picked quotes which are irrelevant to what he was saying. \n \n He has written a few papers on the 9th amendment which address most of your claims. Furthmore, you proved why it is worthless to \"quote\" to you as you cherry pick even what he said! You bolded the natural rights section but failed to realize the next sentence states this was irrelevant and before that in the paper it talks about why. You automatically assume that that the reference to natural rights means the constitution and judges protect these rights and are under their jurisdiction. This is not the case and a bad assumptoin. The section right after what you quoted explains this beautifully.\n \n \nThe answer lies in determining the manner in which natural rights were to be protected. The Ninth and Tenth Amendments drew and maintained the boundary between the jurisdictions of federal and local authorities. This line can be perceived in other amendments as well. For example, it is Congress that \"shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,\" not the states. The states continued to establish religion for a great many years after the adoption of the Bill of Rights.303 The concern animating the Bill was how to limit federal power without simultaneously suggesting that federal authority reached all matters not expressly prohibited. Such a reading would swamp the rights of the people to decide on a local level how they wished to approach \"natural rights\" such as freedom of speech. While this kind of \"home rule\" approach to individual liberty may seem strange to us, it was a matter of first principles to the Founders. For example, when Congress passed the Alien and Sedition Acts, the primary claim made by Madison and Jefferson was that this law abridged the retained rights of the states to regulate on matters of speech, even though speech to Madison was a natural right.304 The very presumption of the Bill of Rights is that personal rights will be better protected if left to the states. As Samuel Adams wrote to Richard Henry Lee:\n\n \n Second, Madisons draft was just that but the purpose remained the same throughout. The change was not to make courts decide what natural rights are but to grant power to the states! \n \n You failed to notice that in those 88 pages of explaining the exact reasoning, understanding, and orginial meaning of the 9th amendment (and even some case law prior to the mid 1900s) is stated and support what I told you the amendment means. It's almost ironic that you want the amendment that is supposed to discourage federal interference in state issues to actually expand federal power by creating new constitutional rights. \n \n \n The article shows a meaning that is true and follows a simple reading of the amendment. Anyone reading the amendment can see that it speaks of two different sets or rights...one in the constitution and one outside. The ones outside our obviously not constitutional rights and no where does it say these rights are to be proteted by the constitution. You seem to think that not saying means they are but that goes against the purpose of the 9th and 10th amendment! \n \n I'll address matthews crazy post now....atleast yours made sense.\n \n \nYour wasting your time tying to explain this concept to him. Steeeeve only agrees, as do most conservatives, with a judicial decisions that favor his conservative position. He belives in the tyanny of the majority though the ballot box. That people must decide every thing. He would support a law made by the legislature and voted on by the people even if the law called for his own death. The people must vote is steeeeve's motto.\nJudicial decisions that favor my position? Pot and Kettle Matthew. Truth be told the Supreme Court often times does things that I like but find incorrect in the constitution. Just look at sodemy laws...those were probably stupid laws and should have been voted away but the courts had no reason to say a state couldn't do so in my opinion. Flag burning is lame and those people should be put in jail but you can't do it! Just two examples of many. You, however, wish to evolve the constitution to suit your needs. I don't want 9 judges to decide my fate as you do. It seems 9 people can easily ruin your day a lot faster than 200 million people can (atleast in this case). I don't understand why you wish to have a tyranny of the federal government over democratic process. I guess you never really did like democracy though.",

My point was that one set is not protected by the constitution as they are not constitutional rights and certainly are protected by the 9th amendment which is more of a interpretation amendment.\n \n \nWhat good do you think there is in recognizing a \"right\" if it isn't protected?\n And also, ALL rights are protected under the 14th amendment.\n In a way they are. They are protected until due process is carried out. I don't adhere to substantive due process and I believe it means what it meant which is just a procedural guarntee. As for being protected..it is protected by the state..or is supposed to be. Even the voters protect it....judges as well...but protecting is different from creating and something not listed in the constitution doesn't get protection by that document...other that the previous part of this paragraph.\n \n \nYOu're going to have to add some words to make that sentence make sense.\nSorry,\n You seem to think that the constitution not saying they are not protected (the rights not listed) seems to mean that they are constitutional protected rights. There is no backing for this. A right to drive at 14 is not a constitutional right...its a state decision that can be changed with no reason at all.\n \n \n\n I realize you're going on about Matthew's post, but I can't help but be reminded of something by these words.\n THE VERY POINT OF THIS THREAD....\n \n This thread is about the judicial activism of CONSERVATIVE judges who make rulings THAT ARE NOT BASED on any actual law.\n But of course, neither you nor jyoshu have shown that you have ANY problem with judges doing that.

MrWriteLA's quotes for example, although I expect they'll get the \"88 pages of Madison analysis answers those claims\" brush-off...\nLet Matthew respond to what was posted to him.\n \n The last of three articles by the Kurt Lash was the \"lost jurisprudence\". This is part of it:\n \n The rarity and universal rejection of attempts to read the Ninth Amendment as a source of libertarian rights tracks the original understanding of the Ninth as a rule protecting the retained collective rights of the people of the several states. It is not that the Founding generation rejected the idea of individual natural rights. Far from it.46 But claims of natural rights were presumptively matters of state law, distinct from the limitations on federal power imposed by the Ninth Amendment.47 The initial application of the Ninth would come not in support of libertarian rights, but in support of the concurrent powers of state government.\n \n This really drives home my point I have been making for some time. I haven't finished reading this article but he tracks the change in the reading which happened around Griswold. These three articles on the 9th amendment are probably the most indepth look on this amendment that I have seen. I challenge you to read all three and see if you still can find a basis for your view of the 9th amendment.",

   "Do you think it's a bad thing when anti-gays insist that gays have to change?\n\n \n That's not the issue of him wanting religious people exterminated. You're trying to deflect attention away from what we're talking about. But to answer your question, yes, I agree with you that they shouldn't insist they change. On the flipside, I don't think gays in the pride movement should insist that other gays DON'T change either in cases where gays want to. More on that below ...\n \n \n2) If you actually THOUGHT about what I was saying, you might be able to piece some things together that you obviously have not. I don't approve of people telling gays that they have to change. Not to get equal rights. Not for any reason.\n In my comparison, you should have realized that I was getting at the fact that both people insisting that gays have to change, and that Christians have to change, meet with my disapproval.\n And the funny thing is that you're about to ADMIT that you \"realize\" that, but you're going to insist that I must be saying something else...\n \n Ooohhh. Wow. You were SOOOO CLOSE, but then you fumbled it at the end.\n \n If insisting that Christians have to change is bad, then isn't insisting that gays have to change JUST AS BAD???\n\n \n Foundit, of course I know you think that. There's no \"realizing\" to it. I don't care if gays change or not. Gays can do whatever they want. (Your behavior is a separate issue from whether marriage should be redefined.) What I've taken issue with here in the past is the way ex-gays are protrayed as liars and frauds by people in your movement, when in fact the ex-gays have made a choice to do what they're doing. The bigger problem I see isn't that gays are being told they \"have\" to change, it's that when they do, their movement views them as traitors and tries to catch them in moments when they fail and trump it up in the press, like when ex-gay leaders are seen in gay bars. It's not like they said it was going to be easy for them--but the point is they chose to try, and continue trying. A choice that really isn't your business.",

   "That's not the issue of him wanting religious people exterminated.\n\n Matthew already addressed your attempted misrepresentation.\n If you go back to his post, you'll see he said RELIGION exterminated.\n NOT \"religious PEOPLE\" exterminated.\n \n Please stop spreading this false-hood. It's rather pointless of you to do so after the truth has been pointed out.\n \n \n \nYou're trying to deflect attention away from what we're talking about.\n\n 1) Did you see the outline of the mirror when you said that?\n 2) Actually, I am trying to talk about \"what we're talking about\" by COMPARING it to what the OPPOSITE SIDE is doing.\n I am still including both sides of this.\n \n \n \nBut to answer your question, yes, I agree with you that they shouldn't insist they change. On the flipside, I don't think gays in the pride movement should insist that other gays DON'T change either in cases where gays want to. More on that below ...\n\n Say whaaaa???\n Christians don't want other Christians to become non-Christians.\n Democrats / Republicans don't want people to switch political parties from Democrat / Republican.\n There is a HUGE difference inbetween one group wanting a person to stay on their team...\n \n ... and a different group not tolerating another's existence, and insisting that they have to change in order to get equal rights.\n \n Do you understand the difference?\n \n \n \nFoundit, of course I know you think that. There's no \"realizing\" to it.\n\n Funny how you just talked about me \"defending\" Matthew, when you state the following here.\n So what were your previous claims regarding me defending Matthew when I wasn't? Were they an error? Or do you still hold to them?\n \n \n \nI don't care if gays change or not. Gays can do whatever they want. (Your behavior is a separate issue from whether marriage should be redefined.) What I've taken issue with here in the past is the way ex-gays are protrayed as liars and frauds by people in your movement, when in fact the ex-gays have made a choice to do what they're doing.\n\n There is much the ex-gay movement is lying about.\n \n Even Dr. Spitzer's study pointed out that when you look at \"ex-gays\" who were HAND-SELECTED BY THE EX-GAY MOVEMENT FOR HIS REVIEW, the majority STILL have feelings towards the same gender.\n \n If the ex-gay movement states that they can \"cure\" people of being a homosexual by turning them into a heterosexual, they are lying.\n Note, I said the \"ex-gay movement\"...\n \n And as for their \"choice\", that's theirs to live with and pick.\n \n \n \nThe bigger problem I see isn't that gays are being told they \"have\" to change...\n\n Of course not jyoshu... emoticon_xangel \n See your own statement which I replied to above with the mirror comment above.\n \n \n \n ... it's that when they do, their movement views them as traitors and tries to catch them in moments when they fail and trump it up in the press, like when ex-gay leaders are seen in gay bars.\n\n Seriously. You complain about us questioning the truth of their claims, and you point to an example of them in a situation that questions the truth of their claims ... \n \n Do you see the ex-gay side coming forward on their own and ADMITTING that they violate their claims? No.\n \n I don't see how you can really level this as a complaint.\n \n And on another level, we can go through a LAUNDRY list of the lies of the ex-gay movement. Their claims that homosexuality is a mental illness. Their refusal to admit their abysmal failure rate, and only sell their \"successes\". There is one example I can show of a kid they sold as their poster child for \"ex-gay\" that eventually saw through their lies, and resumed admitting his sexual orientation and not denying it. The ex-gay movement then LIED and claimed that he WAS NOT INVOLVED with them.\n \n The ex-gay movement doesn't tell the truth on a variety of issues. Do you dispute this?\n Because if not, complaining that we say it is irrelevant.\n \n \n \nIt's not like they said it was going to be easy for them--but the point is they chose to try, and continue trying. A choice that really isn't your business.\n\n The \"choice\" is not really my business. And I do not demonize anybody who makes that choice.\n \n With that said, I DO feel that it should be an INFORMED choice made on the FACTS of the ex-gay movement, taking into account an ACCURATE portrayal of their chances for success, their potential for injury, etc, etc, etc...\n \n If a doctor wanted to perform a medical surgery that he insisted was necessary, and the medical community explicitly stated was unnecessary...\n ... if that doctor refused to tell the patient about the potential for success and failure ...\n ... if that doctor refused to tell the patient about the potential for injury ...\n ... and if that doctor HAD NO LICENSE IN THE FIRST PLACE, we would raise a necessary stink.\n \n But for the ex-gay movement, it's business as usual.",

   "So are you telling me that by \"exterminating\" you mean simply getting rid of all religion in terms of it's practices and beliefs, and you meant nothing in terms of getting rid of the people involved (people like Fred Phelps)?\n\n \n Yes and done in a good democratic process.
