   "In what is one of the biggest leaps in thought processes we've ever seen from the \"pro-family\" crowd, the folks at Mass Resistance and the Traditional Values Coalition, among others, are proffering the possibility that the students who recently beat up the first-grade son of David Parker -- the Massachusetts man who last year protested his child being read a gay-accepting book -- did so because they were protesting the senior Parker's anti-gay stance. This despite the fact that school officials say the children involve have admitted that the childhood skirmish was \"over where students would sit in the cafeteria and then spilled onto the playground.\" \n \n But of course since cafeteria seating arrangements are not a political battle in which the \"pro-fams\" are embroiled, they immediately assume and suggest that the students were \"homosexual agenda\"-indoctrinated lil' liberals who, at age 6 or 7, care more about gay marriage then about who amongst them is the bigger \"poopy face.\" They even suggest that the fact that the incident occurred on May 17, the two-year anniversary of gay marriage legalization in Mass, is proof that the fight involved gay rights. \n \n Unreal. \n \n Now look, we think it's absolutely horrible that this kid was beaten, and we even had hesitancy in writing about it, as it puts what is surely a somewhat embarrassing incident for a first grader even more fully into the public spectrum. However, since Mr. Parker and his defenders seem to have no problem using the incident for political gain, we have no choice but to address it. \n \n If someone on our side is beaten and the word \"###\" written on his face in permanent marker, their side will try to deny that the incident was a gay-related hate crime. However, they jump at the chance to paint a situation as an anti-\"pro-family\" attack without even ONE OUNCE OF EVIDENCE! Sorry, but this is not going to fly with us! It is sadly disingenuous of them to put this baseless idea out there, in hopes that some will be rallied to support their anti-gay rights stance. Not to mention that the school system's superintendent has even told the Boston Globe that the young Parker and his attacker \"have since had a play date,\" yet they've ignored all facts like this! \n \n The thing is, if this incident truly involved gay-friendly kids beating another because his father opposes gay rights, then we would LOUDLY speak out against it! If we saw any sort of evidence from non-gay rights opposing sources that this was the reality, then we'd be the first to cry \"foul!\" However, we're much more inclined to trust legitimate, school official-quoting news sources on matters such as this, leading us to believe that the true malfeasance in this situation is being dished by those who'll stop at nothing to paint us as immoral. If you ask us, the best thing Mr. Parker and his defenders could do is to try and disconnect the father's past incident from the child's present and future educational experiences, rather than presenting it as the precedent that'll define his every school day to come.\n http://www.goodasyou.org/\n \n http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/06/20/official_says_fathers_view_on_gays_didnt_spark_fight/",

   "http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/06/20/official_says_fathers_view_on_gays_didnt_spark_fight/\n School officials, citing interviews with the children involved, said the fight actually started over where students would sit in the cafeteria and then spilled onto the playground. The student, the 7-year-old son of David Parker , who filed a federal lawsuit in April over the teaching of homosexuality in school, was punched several times during the May 17 fight.\n \n ``These were two first-graders having a child squabble on a playground,\" said Superintendent Paul Ash . ``Some adults are exploiting these children for political purposes.\"\n \n The playground fight ballooned into a School Department inquiry after a Waltham-based parents' group, MassResistance, alleged that a group of children pounced on the boy on the two-year anniversary of the legalization of gay marriage.\n \n According to school officials' investigation, one child hit Parker's son two to four times during recess, and the boy fell to his knees as about five students watched . A teacher's aide intervened. The child who hit Parker's son was sent to the assistant principal's office, where he wrote an apology and was denied recess for two days. Parker's son and the boy have since had a play date, Ash said.\n \n School officials contacted authorities, who declined to investigate, Ash said.\n \n Parker said he was unconvinced that the fight had nothing to do with the outcry. He said other students have talked to his son about the issue.\n ======================================================\n \n 1) Not ONE shred of evidence to show ANY reason to believe that the fight was instigated based on gay issues. NONE at all.\n And seriously. How many 7-year olds get into fights because a pro-gay student doesn't like the stance of the father of another student? It just sounds stupid, and I can't believe they actually threw that out there...\n \n 2) \"alleged that a group of children pounced on the boy on the two-year anniversary of the legalization of gay marriage\" ?????\n Oh yeah. These 7-year olds have been WAITING for the anniversary to pull this off.\n \n My GAWD man. Do they realize how paranoid and ridiculous they sound?\n \n 3) \"Parker's son and the boy have since had a play date, Ash said\"\n Of course, to some anti-gay minds, the other boy is just setting up Parker's son for another beating...\n :xbanghead \n \n 4) \"Parker said he was unconvinced that the fight had nothing to do with the outcry. He said other students have talked to his son about the issue.\"\n Uh. Yeah. Sure. Whatever.\n NAME THE NAMES if you're going to claim you have some evidence of your claim of why this fight really took place...\n If other students have talked to your kid about the \"real\" reason this fight occurred, then name the names. It's just that simple.\n \n Or will the \"cover-up\" begin if you do that...\n :xbanghead :xbanghead",

   "As the world continues to fail to end in Massachusetts, the anti-gay folk there must be getting more and more desperate. As it becomes more and more clear that gay marriage will not bring about the predicted societal collapse the saner folk will realize they were wrong and shift their positions. Those that won't are going to look like flat earthers after a while.\n \n No, really, they're all in it together. They're brainwashing our kids and putting floride in the water to turn us gay. Why won't you listen to me?!",
