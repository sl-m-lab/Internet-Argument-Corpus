   "My mom and I were arguing heatedly about this-- I just wanted to see what you guys think.\n \n The younger members of this forum might be able to relate to this better, but the adults should be able to picture this.\n \n So you're taking a standardized test- you know, with the multiple choice, usually 4 choices per question. The choices are A B C and D, and there are little bubbles around the letters. You're supposed to fill in the bubble of your choice in pencil. So... you're filling in the bubbles and then the test monitor person says \"OK one minute left!\" You have ten questions left, and you do not lose points for giving a wrong answer. You fill in the rest of the choices without even looking at the questions. But here's the thing\n \n Do you fill them in randomly, or do you go straight down the line and fill in the same letter ten times in a row? I think that it makes a lot more sense to fill the same letter in ten times in a row, because then you have a great chance of getting at least a quarter of the questions right. My mom says that it doesn't matter which bubbles you choose, because the chance that you are going to get it right is the same for each question. Who is right?",

Sorry. :)\n \n Random is random. Whether you're guessing for just 1 answer or 100, the odds of you getting the right one are only 1 in 4, no matter which one you choose. Think of it this way. If you were only guess for 1 answer, you wouldn't think that guessing A would give you a better chance than any other guess, right? Well, the questions have no memory, and they don't know what the other answers were. Once you've guessed at that first one (and one guess was as good as any other) than whatever you guessed there and whatever the correct answer was will have no bearing on the next question. Any guess will be just as good there. And so on for the rest of the questions. If you aren't convinced than try this. Take two decks of cards, shuffle them both, then deal them out one card at a time from each deck. If you layed them out, you would have two columns of 52 cards. Count how many times the suits match between pairs of cards from the opposing decks. It'll be about 13. Maybe more, maybe less, but if you did it over and over it would average out to exactly 13. Give it a try.",

   "It depends on whether the questions have had the answers randomised or arranged by hand. Chances are, if it is the latter, you will get 25% right by putting all the marks down one column. The former means you are likely to get widely varying results, as humans tend to underestimate the chances of getting long strings of results the same. But basically it doesn't really make any difference.",

   "It depends on whether the questions have had the answers randomised or arranged by hand.\n\n Yes, good point. I've heard that if you're doing multiple chioce A-E, and the answers were generated by hand, then you should guess B or D if you have no clue. A person generating the answers will try to aviod patterns, and appartently the middle and the edges stick out more subconsciously, so test makers tend to avoid them. B and D show up more than the 40% that chance would dictate.",

But there is a chance that you will guess none of them right. But if you go down the line, there is a less chance that you will get none of them right.

Out of 10 questions there's about a 6% chance that one letter will never be picked, if they're randomly distributed. Which is the same as your chance of getting none right if you picked randomly. Any pattern you pick, random, all A's, ABCDABCD, whatever, will give you exactly the same odds to get 0, 3, or all 10 correct.",

   "I'm talking about random events here. It's pretty easy to see that if you guess a certain value - A - that there is 1 way to be right (A is correct) and 3 ways to be wrong (B, C, or D is correct). But if you guess your value at random, then you could choose any of 4 values, each of which could be matched only 1 way and be wrong 3 ways, giving a total of 4 ways to be right but 12 ways to be wrong. \n \n With a difference of only 2 in the first case (3 ways to be wrong - 1 way to be right), but a difference of 8 in the second (12 ways to be wrong - 4 ways to be right), psychologically, it seems that your chances of being right instead of being wrong is much better in the first case than the second. Thus, it appears that sticking with a certain value is better. Besides, the first case is easy to calculate mentally but the second takes more effort, thereby things get lost in the fog: so you have a clear picture of the first but a foggy picture of the second, making the first again appear, psychologically, to be preferred.\n \n However, the math for the second case takes only a little extra thought. And, more importantly, it is not the difference that is important but rather the ratio: in both cases, it's 1/4. In the first, there is 1 way out of 4 to be right: that is 1/4. In the second, there are four ways to be right and 12 ways to be wrong, for a total of 4 ways out of 16 to be right: 4/16 = 1/4. \n \n Psychologically, the first might appear better, but mathematically it's a tie.",
