They were just murdered. Abortion is exclusively done on a child where the parents don't want to raise him/her for whatever reason. I'm pretty sure it has to be before the 3rd trimester to be legal so they are not concious, can't feel anything, most of the time will endanger the health of the mother, and always is unwanted by the parent(s). Most likely the unborn baby will not have very good parenting (most of the time people love their children and will only have an abortion if they cannot care for the child). The parents may not be able to afford to care for the baby or have time. While you can argue that it's bad (I agree) but I still don't think you can compare that to the torture (and forced labor) of adults and children fully capable of taking care of themselves and they are not a danger to anyone's health.",

Either way, it is a bad marker because 100yrs ago it wouldn't be able to survive outside the womb at 20weeks but now it can...does this mean the when someone is a person has changed? I an not all certain I can go with that. Besides who makes you the determiner of when a person is in fact a person?",
