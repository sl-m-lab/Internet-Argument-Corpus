   "US government 'security' contractors in Iraq are under the same rules of engagement as US military forces with the same weapons, including armored vehicles, and anything goes. The latest count on civilian security personnel in Iraq under contract to the US government is 20,000, equal to military troops of the remaining coalition members. Add that to: \n \n Allawi, the former US puppet in Iraq still active in Iraq politics, says human rights abuses in Iraq under the new 'democratic' government are at levels equal to the treatment under Saddam:\n \n http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=1350134\n \n Here's another interesting development, Bush has authorized the US ambassador to Iraq to open talks with Iran about stabilizing Iraq:\n \n http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/GK30Ak01.html\n \n When we (US) make a mess, there's nothing half-way about it. The decision to invade/occupy Iraq has to go down in history as one of the dumbest US foreign policies of all time.",
