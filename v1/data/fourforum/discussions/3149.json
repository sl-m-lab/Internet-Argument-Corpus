   "Some in my church (Evangelical Methodist) say that, because I am an evolutionist, I cannot, ipso facto, be a Christian. I have sworn not to disobey or contradict the church's written doctrinal statements (which seem not to mention evolution). I do most heartily regard the Bible to be both true and authoritative in all that it affirms. It's just that I can't seem to find any passages in scripture which, individually or collectively, preclude such well evidenced propositions as the earth's having an age measured in billions of years...or earthly life's being hundreds of millions of years old...or humankind's having originated, apparently in Africa, some 10**6 years ago...or speciation through natural selection's action upon genetic variation. \n \n I do wince at some of the 'arguments' advanced in (right-wing) Christian popular forums, from pulpits to the radio airwaves. Three common and troublesome ones, for me...\n \n 1. That \"there is absolutely no evidence\" for evolution.\n \n 2. That there is an \"evolutionist conspiracy.\"\n \n 3. That \"no one has ever seen a duck turn into a dog.\"\n \n Now, (1) might be more plausible, rhetorically, if speakers said, for example, that \"evidence for evolution is not without apparent contradiction,\" or that \"evolutionary theory is problematic in the following way...,\" or that \"the evidence is incomplete.\" Remarks such as \"...absolutely no evidence...,\" however, tend to embarrass the speaker more than the scientific community. Beyond being bad reasoning, this is bad--because alienating--rhetoric.\n \n (2) continues to fascinate me. If there is, after all, an \"evolutionist conspiracy,\" could one of you please invite me to the meetings? Can I bring something--cake, cookies? Here again, whom are these speakers trying to convince? To what presumed or actual paranoia are they speaking?\n \n Gaffe (3) offends me, as a Christian. I've heard this one--\"Nobody's ever seen a duck turn into a dog\"--many times on Christian radio, with varied species stuffed into the noun-slots, and heard it several times from pulpits. I gather it's reasonably popular in anti-evolutionist circles. It's bizarre, certainly. Most recently, I heard it from a clergyman of national fame. Because I can't remember the wording with complete exactitude, I shan't quote him by name. Let's just say he is the retiring head of a Very Large Southern Denomination. Let's call him 'Art,' because his argument, in this case, evidences little art indeed.\n \n While (1) and (2) are perhaps just silly, (3) presents a moral dimension. Consider...At no time has evolutionary theory called for 'ducks to turn into dogs' or for anything similar to happen. 'Ducks & dogs' is not an apt objection to evolutionary theory. So the question becomes: Does Art know what he's talking about or not? Perhaps Art's knowledge of evolutionary theory is indeed so shabby that he's speaking quite sincerely, has no awareness of how inappropriate an objection this is, and has no solid familiarity with evolutionary theory. In which case: Why does the Very Large Southern Denomination wish to showcase such visible ignorance and poor argument from its leader? But perhaps Art DOES know the 'Duck & dog' objection is not apt. In which case: Art is speaking in a manner that is at least disingenuous, if not dishonest. Again, the Very Large Southern Denomination, knowingly or not, displays itself in unflattering light via the radio. There is, to be fair, at least one more possibility: that Art is speaking, and intends to speak, when he trots out the 'Duck & dog,' in a kind of literary shorthand, a parabolic style, and believes his audience will understand he's not REALLY asserting that evolution predicts or demands such radical transformations. Sadly, it's pretty clear the audience doesn't 'get' that literary maneuvre. But I did want to give Art and the VLSD an 'out' that let them save face.\n \n Here, I believe, is why such wretched argumentive and rhetorical forms persist in certain Christian forums...They are, in a literal case of this expression, \"preaching to the converted.\" In-church sermons railing against evolution are not really--are they?--designed to 'convert' anyone from an evolutionist to a 'creationist' standpoint. Times I've sat in such churches, I've been surrounded by folk overwhelmingly already given to Young-Earth Creationism. (Most recently, a young minister who'd delivered such a sermon asked me whether I'd been convinced. So much do I like this fine man that I did not wish to offend, and so said, \"Yes. Completely.\" And smiled. You could fairly call me disingenuous: I just didn't have the heart to tell him that what I was completely convinced OF was the utter paucity of most of his lines of argument!) As to the radio waves, I'm guessing that MOST of the audience members likely to listen to a daytime anti-evolutionist diatribe (of the sort I've described for 'Art') are already of that stance.\n \n Most perplexing, finally, is the air of desperation which surrounds some churchmen's claims that you \"can't be a Christian\" if you're an evolutionist. A Christian (the book of James makes clear) is quite capable of any sin. One can be a Christian and an adulterer. A Christian and an addict. A Christian might steal a car. But apparently, for some, 'evolutionist' and 'Christian' has taken on something like the status of contradictio in adjecto. It's a \"logical impossibility,\" one churchman told me, simultaneously to claim to be a Christian and to affirm humans' descent through evolution from other primates, or that speciation occurs, or that the earth is more than about 6000 years old.\n \n If the aim of Christians includes the attraction of and ministry to the well educated, the well read, to people for whom careful thought, argument, and rhetoric are of value, then how will we ever attract such folk through presenting forms of argument like (1), (2) and (3) described above, arguments apparently even disingenuous, and so plainly bad as to embarrass ourselves and repel our audience?\n \n * * * * *\n \n I'm NOT wishing here to enter into debates over the truth or falsity of evolutionist and special-creationist views. My interest here is in matters of argument and rhetoric surrounding those issues. That framework supplied, I'd be grateful for the thoughtful reactions of Christians and non-Christians, evolutionists and others, on the problems of rhetoric that plague some presenters on both sides of the evolutionist/creationist fence.",

   "Hi BradleyHarris.\n \n I see you find yourself in that awkward position of acceptance for two, for need of a better term, points of view, Christianity and evolution.\n \n Problem is there are those who see evolution as the cause of so many of the troubles (real and perceived) in the world that they take every opportunity to discredit, distance and disown it and related sciences from their definition of \"truth\".\n \n One of the things is, when you have such spirited and determined opposition to something, you get camps of people forming, favouring their own particular outlook. This then fosters a \"them and us attitude\". That just makes it harder to accept both viewpoints for if you say \"I believe in Christianity and I accept evolution as fact\" you get the \"are you with us or against us?\" response from, say, Young Earth Creationists, some of who seem to regard a Christian evolutionist as a second rate believer at best and well, lets not get into the worst......\n \n I warily note the familiarity of how easy it is to ridicule evolution by those so inclinded- despite the fact that the lines of reasoning used are often in essence rubbish.

   "Thoughtful comments, Alan!\n \n The question is posed: \"How do I account for the origins of life without invoking a Final Cause for which there is no scientific evidence?\"\n \n And the answer may be: I don't mind invoking causes for which there be no scientific evidence.\n \n The answer may also be this: I regard (Christian) religion and science as two distinct realms of discourse. Anti-evolutionists who think Genesis 'contradicts' science make a mistake. A sort of 'category mistake,' in fact, cousin of the kind Gilbert Ryle talks about in 'The Concept of Mind.' In hockey and football, everybody takes a big break at half time. It's part of the rules. In baseball, you don't break--not in the middle of the fifth inning. So if Brad and Alan are at a baseball game and Brad gets up for a beer and a pee break in the middle of the fifth, Alan may say, \"Wrong game, you crazy Canuck--you're thinking it's a hockey game. Sit down and watch till the seventh.\" Brad has, in invoking the half-time \"rule,\" been thinking and talking in the wrong realm of discourse.\n \n One of the mistakes anti-evolutionist Christians make is in trying to \"be scientific.\" The results range from embarrassing to pathetic, as they trot out all manner of shabby 'evidence' and reasoning. Their mistake, in part, is: Why would you look for 'scientific evidence' AT ALL for essentially religious propositions? These, AS religious propositions, really aren't the sort of thing for which evidence per se is relevant.\n \n Hope this helps.

   "How aptly you put it: \"the awkward position\" of accepting Christianity and evolution.\n \n Socially awkward, certainly. One of the awkwardnesses I find, as a member of a suburban church in the Deep South, is that many of my otherwise laudable church fellows lack te educational foundation you need in order to grasp how evolution works. So much has to be filled in by way of basic material that one doesn't know where to start. Mostly, I sidestep the debate. Already, I am an object of suspicion by reason of possessing \"too much\" education.\n \n Church members' belief is highly conditioned socially. \"Well, that's how I've been taught\" serves, for many, not only as an historic or causal reason for their existent beliefs, but as a full and sufficient justification for continuing to believe thus. In a church in which an elder can be heard to pronounce that evolution is \"satanic,\" where a guest minister preaches that evolutions \"leads to communism, homosexuality, and disease,\" and in which, further, members are conditioned to accept statements at face value, reason and empricism face a distinctly uphill slog!\n \n Thanks kindly for your comments.\n \n Brad\n \n \nHi BradleyHarris.\n \n I see you find yourself in that awkward position of acceptance for two, for need of a better term, points of view, Christianity and evolution.\n \n Problem is there are those who see evolution as the cause of so many of the troubles (real and perceived) in the world that they take every opportunity to discredit, distance and disown it and related sciences from their definition of \"truth\".\n \n One of the things is, when you have such spirited and determined opposition to something, you get camps of people forming, favouring their own particular outlook.

   "When you say, Alan, \"Then I don't think I understand what you mean by 'cause',\" you make, more than a report, an accusation. And your accusation is both right and apt.\n 'Cause,' within scientific discourse, and 'cause' (a term less often used) within (Christian) religious discourse, are not synonyms. 'Cause,' on the religious side, is arguably also a much less precise notion than is its cousin on the scientific side. If I employ 'cause,' in these two senses, within a sentence, or otherwise in close juxtaposition, I not only deal in vagueness, but play with ambiguity, and risk elision. Science-talk and God-talk are, surely, different Wittgensteinian language-games.\n Most scientifically and mathematically trained people I know--whether or not specifically trained also in linguistics or philosophy--have the concept of 'language-game,' or the concept of 'realm of discourse.' They may or may not have read Wittgenstein, or read any of the literature of discourse studies. But they have a reasonable ease and familiarity with the notion that a term has a meaning or use special to a mode of life, mode of talk, universe of discourse. The conservative Christians I encounter--oddly enough, whether or not possessed of much post-secondary education--mostly do not have these concepts at their disposal. I slogged through endless literature courses, in grad school, in which other students of (mostly Southern) conservative religious background essentially declined debate about meaning, and sat, pens poised, waiting for the professor to \"tell us what it means.\" Meaning was, for these people (i) inherently univocal, and (ii) completely determinable, and (iii) \"absolute.\" Their butts puckered in their chairs at the very mention of such notions as \"making meaning,\" or that a text might have different meanings in different cultures. In the latter case, for these folk, one interpretation had always to be \"mistaken,\" the other \"correct.\"\n Christians of this stripe are, it seems to me, disposed, before arriving at any text, any state of affairs to be interpreted, to presume that meaning is univocal and determinable, terms singular, undivided in referent or mode of use. Thus it seems \"obvious\" to such folk that, \"of course the Bible and science are in conflict.\"\n What they miss is that their reading of scripture IS INTERPRETATION.\n They do not see their language and their world-view and their culture as performing any lensing at all. That they're interpreting Genesis \"correctly,\" doesn't arise as a question, because they do not see themselves as INTERPRETING at all.\n \n \n \nHello Bradley:\n So you \"don't mind invoking causes for which there is no\n scientific evidence\" ? Then I don't think I understand what\n you mean by \"cause\".\n Perhaps Ryle's idea of a \"category mistake\" isn't quite germane\n to this argument.

   "You are so right-on in what you say!\n In a Sunday school at a church I formerly attended, an elder of the church remarked that his \"faith was strengthened\" by the \"evidence\" afforded by recent archaeological discoveries in the middle east. In a tone I now rather regret, I blurted out two things...\n ...How weak was your faith before?\n and\n ...If the \"evidence\" had gone 'the other way,' would your faith then have been weakened?\n His answer for the second question was a simple 'no,' which suggests to me that the sense of the term 'evidence' he was employing was not the same sense you'd expect a scientist to use.\n His response to the first was problematic, and interesting. \"My faith,\" he said, has always been--then he used the most interesting word--\"complete.\" But he had taken sufficient offence already, it seemed, that I pressed no further. I wish sometimes that I'd asked: If your faith was \"always complete,\" did the archaeological evidence make it \"more complete\"? And, if so, does your sense of 'complete' match that word's usual application?\n \n I do not quite grasp the notion of there being \"scientific evidence\" for a proposition within the realm of faith. I do not mean to suggest that my claim that scientific and religious propositions reside in different discourses disposes of all worry or complaint. Activity in one realm may be felt in the other.\n \n But, re: evolution, I think this...Given convincing evidence that, say, the earth is billions of years old, not thousands--a mound of evidence more than high enough for my needs--my worry is not that the 'Biblical account' of creation is wrong, erroneous, falsified...but rather is the quite different worry of wondering what, now, that account's meaning is, what it affirms. Scientific discovery, evidence, and discourse thus don't \"disprove the Bible.\" Rather, they serve to displace interpretations of biblical text, and give us cause--I call it: opportunity--to find new, richer meaning in scripture. \n \n I'm often embarrassed by the smallness and brittleness of certain Christians' interpretations. Emphasizing the 'literal,' as some do--a very problematic term in itself--some Christians see in, for example, the Genesis \"tree of the knowledge of good and evil\" nothing more than a tree. A biological tree. Pear tree. Peach tree. Apple tree. Tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Albeit a special species, nonetheless a species. And, for them, there you go--Eve chowed down on the fruit of a proscribed species, and that's your story. Lost, in the insistence upon and closing of that interpretation, is the richness of metaphor the story offers. Metaphor, again and again, is variously deliberately denigrated or unconsciously eclipsed, in the readings of certain Christians.\n \n Science is not the only victim of such cheesily 'literal' interpretation. Christian faith--at least, the possibility of a rich faith robustly aware of its own weight in metaphor, parable, legend and myth, and the transformative power that arises from those aspects of scripture--is equally victim. I feel more sadness about such a limited believer's faith than I do about that person's science.\n \n Master_Shake, for your poignantly apt remark--\"what they have isn't faith at all\"--thanks. Bless you!\n \n Brad\n \n \n \n \n \nYou bet they do Alan. That is exactly what young-earth creationists do. They, through their \"proof\" and \"evidence\" are essentially trying to prove their faith.

Asserted facts are not assumed to be true in science because there is no evidence to the contrary. I have invisible unicorns in my back yard and you can offer no evidence to the contrary. And Jesus walked on water. Neither idea is a fact or science. In science an assertion is meaningless unless there is evidence to support it that can be tested.\n \nHowever, all I wanted to state is that truth is not reliant on scientific evidence.\n\n Duh! You don't seem to have a grasp on what science is. Science isn't a search for truth. It is an attempt to explain observations naturalistic events without appeals to gods, angels, or demons.\n \nYou'll find that out if you go to court.*\n\n What does court have to do with science? You seem to be confused by the fact that in the English speaking world the word \"truth\" is used with different meanings in various contexts.\n \nFor you, you seem to be suggesting that truths in the physical world can only be gathered by scientific means.\n\n It depends on your intention and your methods. Of course, things that don't have some sort of physical manifestation that can be measured can't be studied by science. Science is naturalistic. Scientific data can only include that which can be observed and quantified by natural means. I read it in a book of mythology isn't scientific.\n \nThis would imply that things such as 'love' are not 'true' because they can't be measured by science.\n\n Are you sure? Love is an emotion. Do my cat and my dog love me? They certainly have emotions. Tell you what. Why don't you propose a method by which \"love\" can be quantified. That way there would be no question as to whether it was scientific or not.\n \n I think that it comes back to your constant insistance that science denies anything that is non-material just because science admits a lack of tools to study the topic. Put up or shut up. How can I measure the love for my wife and children and quantify it. Do I have a limited amount of love such that I love my wife less because I also love my children? Do I love one child more?\n \n How is this scientific? Are you so unable to grasp the ideas expressed that you still haven't realized that naturalistic science does not deny that there are things that cannot be measured by science. Science does not deny any god. Neither can it support a god.\n \nBut to take the Apostle's analogy further, if I see something, and know what it is, and you can't measure it, because you weren't there, doesn't make what I see false... as you would believe - seeing as you seem to suggest that in the physical world truth is what can be measured/tested.\n\n Again your failure to understand what science is and how it works. Whatever your apostle tells you, science can't deny that something you may have seen is true. It can deny that it isn't science if it cannot be explained by naturalistic observation. Most especially, if the observation can't be repeated by another, then it isn't science. Science can make no assertion as to what you saw. You may think it is wonderful, but LSD had that effect.\n \n How strange that you think that your emotions are scientific. Actually, it's sad.",

   "You are so right-on in what you say!\n In a Sunday school at a church I formerly attended, an elder of the church remarked that his \"faith was strengthened\" by the \"evidence\" afforded by recent archaeological discoveries in the middle east. In a tone I now rather regret, I blurted out two things...\n ...How weak was your faith before?\n and\n ...If the \"evidence\" had gone 'the other way,' would your faith then have been weakened?\n His answer for the second question was a simple 'no,' which suggests to me that the sense of the term 'evidence' he was employing was not the same sense you'd expect a scientist to use.\n His response to the first was problematic, and interesting. \"My faith,\" he said, has always been--then he used the most interesting word--\"complete.\" But he had taken sufficient offence already, it seemed, that I pressed no further. I wish sometimes that I'd asked: If your faith was \"always complete,\" did the archaeological evidence make it \"more complete\"? And, if so, does your sense of 'complete' match that word's usual application?\n \n I do not quite grasp the notion of there being \"scientific evidence\" for a proposition within the realm of faith. I do not mean to suggest that my claim that scientific and religious propositions reside in different discourses disposes of all worry or complaint. Activity in one realm may be felt in the other.\n \n But, re: evolution, I think this...Given convincing evidence that, say, the earth is billions of years old, not thousands--a mound of evidence more than high enough for my needs--my worry is not that the 'Biblical account' of creation is wrong, erroneous, falsified...but rather is the quite different worry of wondering what, now, that account's meaning is, what it affirms. Scientific discovery, evidence, and discourse thus don't \"disprove the Bible.\" Rather, they serve to displace interpretations of biblical text, and give us cause--I call it: opportunity--to find new, richer meaning in scripture. \n \n I'm often embarrassed by the smallness and brittleness of certain Christians' interpretations. Emphasizing the 'literal,' as some do--a very problematic term in itself--some Christians see in, for example, the Genesis \"tree of the knowledge of good and evil\" nothing more than a tree. A biological tree. Pear tree. Peach tree. Apple tree. Tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Albeit a special species, nonetheless a species. And, for them, there you go--Eve chowed down on the fruit of a proscribed species, and that's your story. Lost, in the insistence upon and closing of that interpretation, is the richness of metaphor the story offers. Metaphor, again and again, is variously deliberately denigrated or unconsciously eclipsed, in the readings of certain Christians.\n \n Science is not the only victim of such cheesily 'literal' interpretation. Christian faith--at least, the possibility of a rich faith robustly aware of its own weight in metaphor, parable, legend and myth, and the transformative power that arises from those aspects of scripture--is equally victim. I feel more sadness about such a limited believer's faith than I do about that person's science.\n \n Master_Shake, for your poignantly apt remark--\"what they have isn't faith at all\"--thanks. Bless you!\n \n Brad\n\n \n You can have reasoned faith, but it need not rely on 'empirical' evidence. There are very many forms of evidence.",

   "In your very thoughtful contribution you explicitly state that you \"regard the Bible as true and authoritative in all that it affirms\" - including one must suppose the account it gives of the origin of life. Presumably, you are convinced therefore that God is the First Cause - whether or not he chose to bring about organic effects by evolutionary means ?\n If we can include \"evolutionism\" among the sciences, then as a science it does not, indeed it cannot, attribute metaphysical causes to physical effects. There is no such thing as \"metaphysical evidence\".\n As you are content to describe yourself as a Christian Evolutionist, you invite the question, \n \"How do you account for the origins of life without invoking a Final Cause for which there is no scientific evidence ?\"\n\n \n This brings up an interesting point, and that is that science is extremely limited. Using your logic, persons should not have believed in the fact that the earth is a round object floating in space before it was proven scientifically, even though it was a fact then, as it is now. This fact was written about in scripture long before science \"proved\" it, just as the description of the hydrological system was described in scripture long before scientists figured it out. THIS is where the evidence can be found for the validity of the Bible. When you find scripture after scripture of historical fact and scientific reference that is found to be accurate, you should tend to take is seriously. The problem with science is its arrogance. It's inability to see that truth can be found in other areas is a real handicap. Add to that theories like evolution that disguise themselves as science, and you have a real problem.\n \n One does not stand on a train track with a train barreling down on them to \"prove\" they will die. This \"fact\" is usually taken to be reliable, even though that person hasn't \"proven\" it to be true through experimentation. If you need scientific proof for everything you believe, you have a real problem. If this were the case, no legal decision on guilt or innocence could be rendered in a court room, since the decision is usually rendered based on the preponderance of the evidence related to a crime that was commited in the past. We have the same problem with the origin of life and evolution of species - macro changes that supposedly occured in the past. As such, every availble form of investigation should be followed up on. This includes metaphysical possibilities. They can be investigated just as evolution is, buy the study of history, manuscripts, archeological methods and statistical and prophetic evidences. Both scientists and creationists are talking about investigation to find truth, and to self limit your investigative techniques is not only reckless, but might be a form of self delusion. Requiring truth to conform to your standards, as scientists of the past did, can either cause great delay in finding truth, or cause you to miss it entirely.",

   "man, i'm sorry i didnt read this before. i've wanted to pick the brains of someone that can accept both evolution and christianity. thebootfitter let me do it to him once, and i appreciate that from him.\n \n the \"are you with us or against us?\" attitude comes from both the christian camp and the evolutionists. both will just as readily tell you you cannot accept both. from an evolutionist standpoint, attempting to throw God into the mix of what you believe is clearly unscientific, so how can you call yourself and evolutionist. the same thing goes for christianity, where the evolutinoary view is unbiblical, secular and materialistic\n \n anyway, my question to you is: what exactly is the significance of genesis? (i know you said that you need to figure it out, but i really would like to probe, if you dont mind)\n \n coming from a christian background myself, the story of genesis is seen by most as a biblical answer to the question \"how come existence\". genesis basically covers that question. as someone with scientific knowledge, you recognize that thats not the real answer to the question, so the genesis account is inaccurate\n \n however, more importantly than the \"story of creation\", genesis lys down 2 fundamental foundations that the entire bible (and by extension, christianity) is based upon:\n 1. God is all powerful\n 2. Man has fallen short and need to be redeemed\n \n if genesis is not taken as a factual account, these 2 foundations are lost, and if so, the entire idea of christianity collapses\n \n the other dilema is that both evolution and genesis cannot be right. they are mutually exclusive and competing for the same question, so if one is found to be true, it immediately and automatically falsifies the other.\n \n so, how can you accept evolution to be true and at the same time accept christianity to be valid?",
