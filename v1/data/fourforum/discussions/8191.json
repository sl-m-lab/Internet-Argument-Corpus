It was also good to see Michael Andretti and Al Unser Jr. back in the big race, even though little Al really screwed up my girl Danica's chances when he crashed with her in the pits on a green flag.\n \n Oh well, a little luck plays a role in races, and she came back strong to finish 8th or so.",

   "Every car in the race was Honda powered. The last time that happened was in 1960, when the Offenhauser was king.\n\n \n Yeah, that does suck. I would like to see a variety of engine builders involved.\n \n Is what I thought I heard correct? This year the engines were running a ten percent ethanol/methanol mixture this year, and next year they will be running pure ethenal? Corn farmers rejoice, I suppose. Here in Illinois most (or all) of the gasoline at the pump is 10% ethanol. E-85 is available cheap at a few places where I live IF you have a vehicle that is made to run on it.\n \n I have a neighbor that swore up and down that their '97 Olds Achieva would run on it, looked it up on the net they claimed. We argued back and forth about it because I have a '97 Buick Skylark with the exact same 3.1 V-6 engine. I looked it up and the majority of the older vehicles made for E-85 were Chrysler/Dodge. Long story short; the Achieva engine took it's last breath (compression next to nothing) a few weeks back at less than 100k miles and the knuckleheads are still argueing that it wasn't the E-85. Uh-huh, my Skylark has 150k + and runs like a top (will still squeal the front tires real good) with a intake gasket replacement by me in the last 30k (fairly big job), other than normal maintanace.\n \n Anyway, it will be interesting next year to see how the race car engines handle being corn-fed, if that is indeed the case.",
