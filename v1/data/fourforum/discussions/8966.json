   "Gay couple told to stop kissing on Airline Flight\n \n http://www.newyorker.com/talk/content/articles/060925ta_talk_collins\n \n I have to admit, based on this story, I don't see what the big deal is here, as far as what these gay couples were doing. People still have to have reasonable personal freedoms, regardless of the moral question. IOW, even with disapproval of someone's actions from a moral standpoint, people should be free to do what they want to do as long as it doesn't cross lines of decency, and it doesn't appear that this did in terms of the actions. Frankly, the story reminds me a but of a scene from the Adam Sadler movie \"Anger Management\" where everyone is blowing sandler's actions on a airplane out of proportion.",

   "First, an anti-gay person lies. No shocker there...\n \n Then, the airline starts to cover its own XXX. And cover its own XXX. And cover its own XXX.\n \n I personally hope they get put through the ringer on this.\n I think they handled the whole \"lying stewardess\" XXXX well, but then their intimidation tactics afterwards are unbelievable. Threatening over and over again to \"divert the plane\" if they don't censor their words???\n \n I think I would have told them, \"I've got a airline flight full of witnesses here, plenty of whom I am confident are happy to repeat an accurate portrayal of events. You divert this plane, and a camera crew will be waiting at the airport to get everybody's story. Questions will be asked. YOU will be making this a news event.\n I have done nothing untoward. I haven't asked for anything out of the ordinary. I have not been disruptive. I will be more than happy to not discuss this issue while I am on this airplane.\n Don't try to intimidate me on this.\"\n \n \n And as for the representative's statement, give me a fricken break!\n Have you EVER heard of ANY couple being asked to stop kissing in the air?",

It seems the article is written to tell one side of the story but at the end someone said \"it wasn't just a peck\"....so I am a little confused by what actually took place...I would say \"making out\" would be a little extreme but it doesn't seem that was the case.",

   "so what exactly happeened? It seems the article is written to tell one side of the story but at the end someone said \"it wasn't just a peck\"\n\n Actually, the representative of the airline who WAS NOT THERE said that their \"understanding\" was that the level of affection was \"more than a quick peck on the cheek\".\n Good luck getting the airline to explain that one. Undoubtedly, they'll keep their yap shut. The \"released statement\" on XXXX like this is typically a smoke-screen to gloss over the incidents in vague and non-descript statements...\n \n And on that note, if you can find the other side of the story, it would be a welcome addition. But if only one side is speaking, and the other is insisting on silence, that obviously should mean something to a lot of people...",
