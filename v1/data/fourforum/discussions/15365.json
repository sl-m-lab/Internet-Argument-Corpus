It became necessary when they started killing people.\n \n I don't know if you have a feel for this but each tribe acted independently, you could have a peaceful harmonious tribe right next to a nut case no survivors tribe, in fact the peaceful ones were victims just as settlers were.\n \n I disagree with U.S. policy on this point. They treated it like a series of wars with individual tribes. Therefore they were constantly trying to negotiate treaties and new territorial lines. This was a bit dishonest to how they actually thought of it and the legal precedent that had been set. Britain, Spain, and France had claimed huge tracts of land without knowing anything about it. The U.S. took over British and Spanish land, and bought french land. It is contradictory to have a treaty about sovereignty while at the same time claiming it is U.S. territory.\n \n They should have informed them that the days of killing people over the vast tracks of land you claim are over. Told them that they are citizens if they care to be but that U.S. laws will be enforced. All of this of course dependent on the U.S. to make just laws which has never been completly true.\n \n How do you define marginalized and what possible motive would anyone have for that?\n \n \nNo native tribe worked especially hard to protect the rights of man?\n What does that mean?\n\n Just what it says. No tribe had a government dedicated to the preservation of rights.

I am one of the few who could guarantee that they can live any way they want and I will not try to stop them.\n \n \nThey killed interlopers but not quickly enough to repel them in the case of the settlers who brought their own brand of civilisation not an ideal or utopian one.\n\n No, as I said most tribes did not go on killing sprees. If they did settlers couldn't go west without an escort. The movie scenes of natives attacking settlers make for good screen play but were obviously not common enough to dissuade people from bringing their family along.\n \n Technically the natives did not have civilization, remember civilization is not the same as culture or technology.\n \n They brought American culture but they did not try to force it upon natives, quite to the contrary American culture has assimilated some native ones. Many many places in America retain their original names. I know where to buy a dream catcher :p\n \n \nIts not insanely ignorant its true.\n The US has happily traded with repressive and cruel regimes such as Iraq, Iran,Indonesia and Saudi Arabia to name but a few.\n\n I have told you I care about the freedom of everyone and I know many people here who feel the same.\n \n It didn't surprise anyone but leftist when bush claimed we were also after the freedom of the Iraqi people, I for one took that as a granted.\n \n You think I care if Saudi Arabia stands? I wouldn't object if the army went in and tried to setup a democracy there too.\n \n I know why that is not going to happen and it's not oil money, it's that people here are afraid of being called imperialist. You cannot simultaneously claim that invading middle eastern countries is to gain oil while saying not invading countries is for the same reason. I know plenty of fools who would claim Saudi Arabia is how 'they' want their society. The premise of which is of course that any differences between peoples and cultures can affect the morality that applies to them.\n \n Trading with them sure, because the solution to oppression isn't trade embargoes it's invasion; but nobody wants to think about the problem so we pretend everything is just fine over there.\n \n If I have one problem with the U.S foreign policy it is that American hypocrisy on liberty, rights, and government weakens any justification plus we are spreading the same errors that exist in the U.S. along with what freedoms we have. Beams and splinters you know.\n \n \nThe treatment of the citizens of these countries only become an issue when the it can be use as propaganda against them...usually when they fall out with the States .\n\n At least when leftist are in office.\n \n \nSo I say again... \n The US was and is only interested in the freedom of nations to trade with them, not the freedom of their citizens.They never have given a fig for the latter unless it affects the former.\n Hence my assertion the the US does nothing unless it in the interests of the US.\n\n What do you think the chances at trading with nazi Germany or Vietnam were?\n \n The states put themselves through years of embargo with British companies during the revolution. That doesn't seem to follow the pattern you have described.\n \n \nPlease dont think my posts are a rant against the American people and if you do then call me on it.\n I have the highest regard for the people of the US.\n\n I have no nationalistic notions to insult.",

   "From where does this absolute morality originate?\n\n It is a consequence of fundamental properties of a rational mind existing in the same universe with other rational minds. In this way it is almost like a physical constant (as sigma just said in another thread) but those who say it would be undefined without people are absolutely correct. What they mean to say when they say that is that it is subjective or a construct of the human mind, vulnerable in substance to anything people think. That is not true because requiring something to exist to be true does not imply that something is not objective. You may as well claim weather can mean anything at all because it depends on atmospheres to exist, it simply doesn't follow.\n \n To be extremely brief, it is a result of the logical root of the golden rule. Another way to describe it is as a unique value system; unique because it is universal.\n \n It's basic substance as opposed to being authority (as it is in other moral theories) is human values. Why values exist is another subject, but it is incontrovertible that they do exist.\n \n I read you were reading atlas shrugged, there is one crucial difference between rands terminology and mine; it is a change that I think clarifies my position. She has morality for an individual being based off all his values provided they are rational. In my arguments however I am totally uninterested in a large chunk of this morality, I call it personal morality. Which is honesty to yourself (integrity). This morality is no less real, and you will feel guilt for betraying what you believe just as surely as you should if you did something immoral to another person, but what I am interested in arguing is what I call social morality, i.e. 'rights' etc. The reason for this is that I really haven't any interest in convincing people that they need to live a certain way, it's their business; social morality (liberty) is what is needed for a just society and that's all you should be owed by others; which means it's all you really have a right to demand in debate.\n \n This social morality in short is an abstraction of a universal human value. A value is a good to the individual that holds it and a universal value is a universal good. A universal good defined by human behavior is a moral principle.\n \n Yes it is merely a series of definitions, but they are non-contradictory and if you follow them back far enough the existent with which they deal are objectively real. This is all one can ask of any theory. Natural selection (yes on my mind) is a concept that can be called 'just definitions' but the fact that what if defines can be tracked back to provable processes is what makes it real where science fiction, even if self-consistent is not.\n \n Here is the argument in a longer and more ordered form http://www.4forums.com/political/formal-open-debate/14447-society-based-volition-ideal-one.html. Yes I know that it is not perfectly complete and that between the premises one is expected to do some thinking. All arguments on this level are like that, I expect those with questions will ask them.\n \nIs it innate in all living things or does it apply only to humans?\n\n All beings have values, but only a rational being can establish a concept for a principle of good. So it only applies to rational beings, if you are asking if we are the only rational species on this planet I am not absolutely sure of that, however there couldn't be many and the vast majority of animals, though possessing emotion and intelligence are not rational.\n \n The ability not only to have a value but to recognize the principle is quite necessary to morality, you see even a human can violate morality by contradicting the principle (ignoring for any reason the implication of a value), this contradiction is akin to intentionally nullifying one's own rights and this is what occurs when criminals violate morality, and why it's perfectly alright to lock them up. A being without reason could never perform the necessary derivation for morality much less contradict it.\n \n \nHas this got something to do or linked maybe to the concept of the selfish gene?\n\n I place little stock in the idea that we know enough about how brains are constructed and work biologically to try to make meaningful connections with genetic material. The selfish gene I suspect as a concept must apply to humans as it does other social animals, but there is generally an implication (not saying you made it) that when you say something is the result of a gene it is predetermined or hard coded.\n \n Humans among all other animals have invested vast 'survival points' in the brain. A human being probably has the least instincts of any animal because a mental process is better than an insticnt, it can adapt at the cost of thinking as opposed to several generations of selection. Natural selection does not care why or how genes are selected only that they are beneficial.\n \n A rational mind is able to value others through cognitive process with as simple a axiomatic value as life itself. To evolution maintenance or growth of a rational faculty is better, easier, and more foolproof than hard coding social instincts.\n \n The conscious abstracted value systems of a human being are worth a thousand hard coded instincts and can be applied to as diverse functions as finding the best food to helping others in the tribe.\n \n This all has been just my speculation. Someone once asked Rand about the 'sacred god given' part of the declaration of independence. She basically said that it doesn't matter how or why humans got here and why they are the way they are. What they are now is their nature and that's all we need to establish morality.",

   "I assume that a society that embraces Objectivism would assume that the philosophy that underpins it would need to be taught to the populace.\n\n I would certainly vote for that if society opted for a public school system.\n \n \nHowever when I read your thread I could not help but think of the pioneering days of the old west( or at least what I have read and seen on the tv).\n\n Well the old west brings up a lot of ideas all at once. I can't say if I know more about it than you, I have read some real history on it as well as watched some documentaries. Some things in popular culture are certainly true, the shootout at the O.K. corral was quite real although whether events like that were as typical as they are portrayed is another matter.\n \n The lack of law and order has absolutely nothing to do with liberty and everything to do with a lack of organization. The old west I think is actually a point in favour as it consistently showed that even a small community will voluntarily do what is required to maintain justice. If the counter-theories were correct an old west town would be inherently unstable and doomed to quick destruction under the force of the populaces unrestrained greed.\n \n Instead exactly what objectivism would predict happen happened, yes there was a grave threat to law and order; always from broke malcontents and never from successful self-reliant peoples and towns.\n \n \nIn fact I could not imagine it being accepted in any other society than the US either then or ( more unlikely) now.\n\n What is so special about the U.S. that we could make liberty work but no one else could? I don't believe it for a minute.\n \n \nIve have just returned from a holiday in Las Vegas what I heard from the people who live there and from what I picked up from its history it seems that Clark county is the nearest thing to Objectivism in action that I will ever see.Feel free to disagree.\n\n I do disagree, las vegas is an attractor for all it represents because no one wants it anywhere else. You may have noticed it's built in a useless desert out of the decaying remains of railroad town, that's because it doesn't offer production; it is merely somewhere where people go to waste their money and their time. I apologize if this offends you as an admitted visitor to the place but I dislike gambling, the mob, and wasteful extravagance; and that is what pops into my mind when I hear las vegas.\n \n If you must have a city to consider an example of objectivism it would be new york, but I would advise against all such simplifications. A philosophy is not a city.\n \n The most common and ancient piece of propaganda known is the association between liberty and lawlessness. It is the idea that people left to their own devices will simply mutate into rampaging apes, an idea that seems to be acutely unaware that all governments and religions, and everything they claim controls people are constructed by, manned by; and composed of people too. All that I will cede is that if people have come to be reliant on a system of law and order and it is suddenly removed, they are incapable of dealing with criminals themselves. This is true of everything in high civilization not just law and order. If people are accustomed to running water and you shut off the pipes things are going to get bad, that does not mean wells and rivers don't work too nor does it mean pipes aren't better; it certainly doesn't say anything about the long term viability of centralized plumbing or law and order.\n \n \nMy problem with it is that I do not think that humans are consistently rational enough for it to work although I could be wrong.\n\n I think they are, I think culture has far more to do with the way people act than not and I would not confuse a transient cultural state with man's nature. Besides which we have little choice, there is only forwards or backwards as the only alternative to proceeding on the premise that people are rational is proceeding on the premise that they are not. That road leads to 1984, to communist committee, to Nazi death camps. I have heard it said against liberty that people will not accept it, how much less will they accept a slavery? Slavery constructed of their supposed inferiority to who ever it is that is supposed to be good enough to rule them where they could not rule themselves. We do not need to imagine, what was a noble but someone who was more worthy to make decisions for a society than most? What were the Nazi's trying to do but remove the more 'useless' people in society? I have heard it said that capitalism has been tried and failed. What has failed more in human history than the idea that some class of stupid (irrational) inferior incompetent people need to be ruled by some class of intelligent (rational) superior competent people?\n \n Capitalism has not failed, it has in fact driven 99% of all wealth ever produced by man kind. and it works because people are naturally rational, they apply their minds at work, when their buying things, to school; but they simply have been trained to think that morality, politics, social theory are innately subjective and applying reason to them is some mix between hopeless as naive.\n \n \nIf you remember the youtube videos of the bbc programme' All watched over by machines of loving grace' it was the young Silicon valley entrepreneurs that took up Rands philosophy.\n This is where its natural home is IMO \n\n I think rand might respond to that with something like \"why can't we all be young entrepreneurs in our minds then.\" The trader principle extends to far more than just the economics of someone with a novel idea.\n \n \nthat says nothing. Kissinger said in his new book that the USA since Jefferson has thought the world was all the same and so could conform to our superior philosophy and institutions.\n\n Philosophy doesn't belong to a nation, and our institutions are no greater than anyone else's at this point.

   "Was bread and circuses personal liberty?\n\n Rome has a 500 year history, I am afraid you will have to be more specific.\n \n \nIf we are the noble creature you suggest we are\n\n You say that as if you have no way to tell.\n \n \nBillions of Chinesed embraced it so they were not aware of this.\n\n I know.\n \n \nWell the wealth of Japan was built on a compliant and almost fanatically zealous workforce(Karoshi?)\n\n Admirable, and hardly collectivist.\n \n \nWhich makes me tend to believe place and time is a critical factor.\n\n I am sure that I never disagreed that it would not be a matter of flipping a switch and utopia. I merely mean that the idea that some humans \"aren't suited\" for liberty is absurd.\n \n \nSurely fear from thinking of fear is neurotic not rational.At yet we all do it.\n\n Fear from thinking of fear? huh?\n \n \nNo I dont very much.Ive seen much triumphalism and hypocricy in many condolences.\n\n Everyone is hypocritical, spiteful, etc... sometimes. It is a very important social value to be able to recognize aberrant behavior from a real character flaw. I have met very few people who I think deserve disdain regardless of such mistakes.\n \n \nI admit to have felt Schadenfreude at people who I consider enemies but \n\n If it's their fault that your enemies then there is nothing wrong with feeling satisfied that their own policies have resulted in a bad end. That is not to say that you thought it was good that an evil occurred, but that you thought it right that the evil should be made apparent even to it's owner.\n \n \nI dont generally enjoy others discomfort.I dont feign sympathy either\n\n Then you are in a good place (dishonesty is the greatest harbinger of social problems regardless of intentions). So that's you, that's me; invariably those who take a pessimistic view of man will respond as you have, 'yes I've got it covered'; only that vague and distant 'people in general' seem worthy of being labeled irrational parasitic corrupt XXXXXX, but never the people at hand.\n \n They are real, and if I asked them what would they say? If I asked everyone what would they say?\n \n No, I am convinced that what evil exists in man it exists in the fallacies that he allows to corrupt him. Fallacies are learned, and no matter how they rot a man's soul they are still a disease mutilating his true nature; the nature we all feel when we touch a memory of complete peace, but not the peace of silence or finality but the peace of absolute hope and a happiness only possible in that context. Many have only a few child hood memories from before they 'matured' (or so they told themselves), a process of growing up which replaced hope with 'realism', trust with cynicism, desire with guilt. By the time I got to the final speech of atlas shrugged, those memories which I had only felt became facts which I knew. Someone who goes through that can never go back.\n \n You can't possibly overestimate the value I see in every person including myself. The idea that there is some fundamental flaw with man is not new, it's called original sin and it had other names before that, if you want to know why I think objectivism effects so many in the way it does it's because it allows you to fight yourself the foggy pressure of guilt that builds up like cob-webs as a result of the inane so called philosophies that wander about like ghosts (for none will dare claim they are based on anything). It does this by offering a rational framework for the mind, life, and society as science does for nature. The rational is key, for without rationality you are simply talking about a subconscious maze of feelings, which affect your life but which you cannot understand much less control.\n \n I can't speak for you, but any inherent, that is prejudiced mistrust of others, their motives, their integrity, their rationality, their competence faded for me with that immaterial guilt of original sin that is built every time someone tries to blame human nature for an evil which by the definition of evil is unnatural to man.\n \n Man is a being of reason and objectivism is the philosophy of life, if you want to know who I think will accept objectivism most easily, it is those most oppressed by the anti-man concepts. I understand why you think it's a philosophy for rich American entrepreneur types, but the only reason they are first in line is because they live their lives according the objectivism whether they call it that or not. It holds just as much promise for the brick layer in Saudi-arabia, the starving kid who has no education in africa, the middle class Japanese office worker.... for all men. The truth is that it is easier to name the exceptions and the exceptions are not classes, or races, or cultures or any member of the category human, the exceptions are ideas. It holds no promise for a parasite, for a worshipper of ignorance, for a mystic....... for irrationality.\n \n Revolutions do happen, no society is set in stone; but more importantly I can guarantee you that no mystical force is going to fix anything for us. Utter apathy and despair is the only route which giving up on your own species will open. The gods help those who help themselves.",

   "what?? As Warren Buffet said when you owe the bank $5000 you're in trouble, when you owe the bank 5 million the bank is in trouble. They have no leverage at all.\n\n \n Really? You think so, because what your saying is you would rather owe 5,000 than be owed 5 million. If 5 million is going to cause you problems if you lose it then you probably should not have loaned it out. \n \n This is the same as saying \"It will be ok\" coming from someone who doesn't know if it really will.\n \n \nno idea what you are talking about?? China holds only 800 billion out of 14.3 trillion in US debt. It seems you're confused??\n\n \n Not as much as you seem to be China holds 1.152 trillion as of April 2011. You can kick in another 276 billion between Hong Kong and Taiwan. Mainland China represents 26% of the 4.4 trillion foriegn owned debt.\n \n \nyou are confused. IF they don't buy our debt with our dollars from Walmart then their prices will go way up and they will no longer be China. Get it, they can't do it!!\n\n \n First yes they can. Will there be repercussions to their economy of course. Where your missing the point is you seem to think that it will devastate them. Not a chance. Their currency is undervalued 20 - 40% so what if it increases in value. All that means is it might become only 10 - 20% below what it should be, but even that is iffy since they are more than willing to do whatever to keep it low. The would lose some revenue as other countries became more competitve because of the currency increase. Most of the developing Asian countries that compete with China are still years away from having the ability to become a threat and should one do so I would not be surprised if that country suddenly became a Chinese colony. Just to add some frosting currently China has @ 2.4 trillion stuffed in its mattress. This continues to grow @ 30 billion whic is the amount over its needs that it has.\n \n So we have an idea of what will happen to China really nothing real damaging. Maybe some short term financial bumps but collapse, no. \n \n How do you think the US would match up? It wouldn't we would tank. There is no one else we can borrow the kind of money we need. You think credit and inflation are issues now, wait until you see what happens if China dumps it's US assets and will not buy any more.\n \n \n \noh so now you admit they ca't do it???? \n\n \n Oh God read what I posted again it is not difficult.\n \n \nwhat on earth are you talking about???????/\n\n \n My point was that it is in the best interest of China to keep the US in it's current financial crises. One of the primary reasons has to do with natural resources. China is actively pursuing them wherever they can. They don't care who the government in charge is. They are willing to overpay and do trades such as building infrastructe for mining rights. They negotiate with the power of the government at the table allowing them to make much better offers than Western speculators. \n \n With the US as it is there is little it can do to halt or slow the China's expansion. Lack of resources will cause China to experience financial troubles well before dumping US debt will",
