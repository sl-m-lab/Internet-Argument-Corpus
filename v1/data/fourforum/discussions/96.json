   "\n in response to mac vs. pc proc. speed:\n this was already stated but it seems someone didn't understand; it usually works liuke this: double the mac proc. speed and that is the pc equivalent. it is a very basic way to determine it but i makes plenty of sence.\n \n \n Yes. It seems someone really doesn't understand! When you talk about overall speed, there is really no way to say whether one architecture is better than another because it's very application specific. Because of that, people base their metrics on numbers of arithmetic operations a processor can perform per second on average on a specific type of application. You can break this into two things:\n \n Total Speed = [number of operations per clock cycle] x clock speed\n \n The clock speed is what people talk about in MHZ! In that sense, the PC has better clock speed. In terms of number of operations per clock cycle, the PC used to do a lot worse than MACs, but it's not true anymore because starting with the pentium, makers of PC processors (AMD and Intel, in particular) incorporated so called superscalar pipelined architecture into their processors.\n \n On the really old PCs, it normally takes several cycles to complete an operation, so the [number of operations per clock cycle] is less than one for those old PCs (older than pentium). \n \n For newer PCs (pentium and above), pipelining breaks the execution into stages creating a pipeline. This allows one instruction to start executing while the other one is executing. This process brings the [number of operations per clock cycle] up to very close to one for most applications. Superscalar architecture is basically replicating the pipeline so multiple instructions can be executed simultaneously (if there is no dependency). This means that the [number of operations per clock cycle] gets increased by a factor close to the number of pipelines in the processor; again, this is application specific.\n \n For the most part, the newer decent PCs have better or equal [number of operations per clock cycle] than MACs (again, there are a lot of PCs -- there are those embedded processors that you can get that are crappy but drain less power yada yada). So why do people think MACs are faster even though they are slower in clock speed? Application! MACs have instructions that do specific things. They are more CISCier than PCs, but that's not even true anymore. Things like MMX, 3dNow, etc... are making specific applications MUCH MUCH faster on the PC.\n \n The overall speed of your computer depends also on the bus speed, bus size, hard disk cache size, hard disk seek time, number of items you have attached to your bus, motherboard chipset (this includes north bridge, south bridge, yada yada), video card, memory speed, cach speed, memory size, cache size.... and so on.\n \n I am of the opinion that if you don't know what you're talking about, you should keep your mouth shut instead of yapping about some generic results that you probably read from some opinionated trade magazine.\n \n Maybe you should think twice about saying something as foolish as double the mac proc. speed and that is the pc equivalent because, unfortunately, things aren't that simple, and MACs aren't that good.\n \n \n in response to \"mac os is a bad operating system\":\n this is your opinion... a bad one though. mac os x is great operating system. it is unix based (i believe open desktop). unix system are stable and rarely crash (unlike windows). os x is faster, more beautiful, has great apps that surpass the pc (such as imovie, idvd, safari, itunes, ical, ichat, iphoto, and even microfost said that office fore mac is better than the pc version). everything is so simple.\n \n \n There is an argument here because there is no objective way to evaluate an operating system. Your criteria are very subject: looks, better apps... those are VERY subjective. \n \n Before I go any further, let's refine our definition of Windows to the newer product line of windows (Win NT and 2k and XP). \n \n Let's confine ourselves to talking about architectural superiority. \n \n There are two generations of MAC OS. The older version definitely suck because there is no preemptive multi-tasking. THis means that you can't run two programs at once. If you try to run one program with one in the background, the one in the background has to be suspended -- this is generally called coorporative multi-tasking and is obsolete since.... dinosaurs were around. Apple got smart and adopted the MACH kernel which implements the newer kernel architecture called microkernel (because the kernel is tiny and system jobs are divided into system processes) -- this is as opposed to monolithic kernel. Windows NT, 2k, and XP are all microkernel based. The MACH kernel (and the HURD OS) are projects that have been dragging for a long time without going anywhere -- that's probably the reason why you probably has not heard anything about it. The problem with adopting the MACH kernel is that it's completely different from old MAC software. This means that Apple has to patch up the kernel to make it compatible with at least some of their software. In the process of doing this, they [in short] ****ed up the kernel. They added many many layers of multithreading and process management in able to support both preemptive and coorporative processing. Because of this fancy addition, their kernel naturally slows down (when you make your computer do so a lot of stuff, it slows down). On top of that, Apple likes its graphics engine... that's what it was known for, so they hacked that on top, too. This is why if you are used to windows and try to use a MAC running MAC OS, you get the sluggish feeling.... I realize it's subjective, but most people who use both platforms interchangeably (like myself) would probably agree with me.\n \n There's the short of why MAC OS has a bad architecture. I can go on, but I have to grab lunch.\n \n Sorry I have to give you half a history lesson on development of MAC OS... and a little bit on OS architecture.\n \n \n only 1 button mice:\n yes, apple only sells 1 button mice... other companies build mice too. os x supports 2 button mice it is just that apple doesn't encourage it; they believe that 1 button mice are simpler (that is apple's flaw).\n \n \n Ok, this is subjective. My comment made it clear that I personally don't like the one button mice....\n \n \n not many apps for mac:\n well besides the superior ones above, the mac has many apps that are equal are better than the pc (well aside from games... only gamers struggle with macs).\n \n \n Again, this is arguable. It depends on what your use is for your computer. \n \n So the moral of the story is? Mac or PC? Depends on what you want to do with your computer. If you're an ordinary person [in whatever sense you want it to mean], Mac or PC? Depends on your taste.",

How's that for an inference?\n \n  this is seen in the 'windows vs. mac os' decision. windows is the status quo and people latch onto this. this is a terrible way to choose something... anything, but society does this all the time. they feel better knowing they are 'safe' in masses.\n \n \n Which, again, is totally unrelated to whether MACs are better or PCs are better. The fact that Windows is a status quo because people are afraid to switch to MAC or whatever other architecture may or may not be true, but it is unrelated to whether MACs are better than PCs or the other way around.\n \n Let's look at what you said before\n \n \n wow, the voice and mentallity of the pc world; i'm so glad to be a part of the mac world...\n \n If you know any English, you'd think that means something to the point of \"I am glad to be a part of the MAC world because this (as demonstrated by the previous post) is the voice and mentality of the PC world\". Is that a better way to choose MACs over PCs [than what you condemned people for choosing PCs over MACs]?",

   "\n ... let's have fun in this 'fun debate' section. pointing out fallacies is not the way to go about winning an argument. it is only showing flaw in the human language.\n \n \n Let's have fun but still be debating. Pointing out fallacies is actually a way to show that the arguments from the other view are invalid. When arguments are invalid, they are, obviously, invalid. It doesn't just show flaw in the human language, although sometimes people think it does for some specific instances. On that note though, a common mistake in making arguments is being vague -- and that's generally because people don't effectively use language; some blame that on \"flaw in the human language\". This is, though, an unrelated topic.\n \n \n i love macs. i can say this with no evidence, proof, or reason. i just do.\n i hate pcs. i can say this with no evidence, proof, or reason. i just do.\n \n \n When you say that, there can be no debate. There is really nothing to debate about, and some people may even say that you are stubborn (or ignorant) -- i.e. when you hold a view with no reasoning and will not accept reasoning.\n \n \n are you going to question someone's personal preferences?\n \n \n Nobody's questioning anyone's personal preference; Had you said \"I like MAC because I do\", I would be happy saying \"great!\" But that's not what happened. You gave reasons that are not true or logically flawed.\n \n \n i won't even bother to reply toy our last post; most of it is dribble (i can say this too, without evidence, proof, or reason, for it is my opinion).\n \n \n See previous remark.\n \n \n sure, others may agree with you, but to you, falsities lie only when others don't agree with you.\n \n \n Maybe you haven't been following. I think that anyone who has a clue would have noticed that so far my emphasis is in logical correctness. This means that falsity, to me, is when the negation is deducible or the statement is inconsistent.\n \n \n but, of course, i can't read minds, so everything i said is only speculation. sorry for my human answers. \n \n \n I see the sarcasm; I also see you didn't really understand my comments -- maybe I was being unclear. On a related note: if I am correct, there are several philosophers (contemporary, too, I think) who suggest that people are inherently illogical by evidence given in some experiments -- how convincing this is depends on of course on your judgement, unfortunately.\n \n \n learn to communicate. i know you cannot be a mass communication major.\n \n \n This is, as I am sure you know, what people called an ad hominem argument in debating. It means you are making an argument against the debater and not his/her arguments. This generally happens when you have no reasoning behind your views and are getting stubbornly defensive.\n \n A direct reply would be \"learn to communicate logically and effectively! if mass communication majors are illogical and stubborn, then no, I am not a mass communication major, and I really would be offended if someone considered me as one.\" That, though, would be childish.\n \n \n back to the subject at hand.\n \n i'm glad to be a part of the mac community!\n \n \n Suit yourself. I should point out that I made no view on whether MACs or PCs are better. I made some objective factual remarks on various things, but those are objective and factual. Furthermore, I actually commented that I use both platforms for different puposes. Let me reiterate my view on the subject one more time:  Mac or PC? Depends on what you want to do with your computer. \n \n Here is something totally unrelated to the thread (and don't read if you don't want to) and you may take it for what it's worth: let's have fun debating and leave out emotional attachments and personal attacks.",

   "I was gonna post the Mac video, but Erin...err Witzelcheck already did.\n Let's see...\n The recent speed tests with the G5 \"killing\" the fastest available P4 processor were extremely botched purposely. The p4 did infact outperform. Here is the article: http://spl.haxial.net/apple-powermac-G5/\n Point for PC's.\n \n I use PC's at home and at work. We have 4 computer labs with Macs at school and 1 with PC's (recently upgraded to 2ghz P4's, but the old pentium pro 200's still worked better than the macs) I have Photoshop7 at home and at work and also at school.\n I've been using it alot for a class right now and the Emac's we're using perform horrendously. My old P3-450 with 256 mb ram grossly outperforms it. The statement that you take the mac processor speed and double it and that's the equivalment PC speed is untrue here.\n I'm pretty sure the Emacs we have are 700 mhz G4 with 128 mb ram.\n Point for PC's.\n \n Macs are easier to use? If you know something about computers you can figure either out. I'm computer skilled and help out classmates alot with computer problems. To them the Mac's *sometimes* are easier to use.\n Point for Macs?\n \n And yes the mighty OSX, faster, more stable, easier to use.\n The teacher's station in the lab we've been using in one of my classes is on OSX now. They just upgraded from 9 a few weeks ago. It now works MUCH slower than it used too, things dont work. The teacher said he doesn't like it (he's an avid user). The funny thing is when he couldn't figure something out I figured it out in about 10 seconds never actually having used OSX before. However the speed problems may not necessarily be OSX's fault, as it could just be configured wrong or something (the tech. admin's in my school don't know XXXX and If they help a student with something other than simple they can't figure it out.)\n Point unknown.\n \n I know a guy with macs. He seems to be reinstalling from fatal crashed alot. The only time i ever REinstalled any of my OS's was 1. when I mortally screwed something up on my first computer a little bit after we got it. When I upgraded to a larger harddrive on my last computer.\n \n I'm an avid PC user. I'm not all that fond of microsoft. I upgraded from win98 to XP and they definately started doing things better. It's not perfect but I thank God it works better than a mac.\n I don't hate macs or mac users...they're just misunderstood. When I see a person with a mac, I may laugh a little, but mostly I just pity them.\n \n I had other stuff I was going to say, but cannot think of it as it is getting late and I had trouble organizing these thoughts.",
