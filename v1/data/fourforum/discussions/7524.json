   "My oh my, who woulda thunk it? Catering to and offering residence to immigrant members of TDC isn't working very well at all! Though the UK had absolutly nothing to do with the bomb turban Mohamhead cartoon's --- well, it just doesn't matter to Islamofacists...all are infidels. Europe has made a huge mistake in underestimating the serious fanatical nature of Islam. \n \n \n Muslim protests are incitement to murder, say Tories\n \n By Melissa Kite, Deputy Political Editor\n (Filed: 05/02/2006)\n \n The Conservatives last night called on the police to arrest militant Muslims who threatened Westerners with violence during protests in London over newspaper cartoons that mocked the Prophet Mohammed.\n \n As fanatics - some dressed as suicide bombers - staged more protests yesterday, David Davis, the shadow home secretary, said the police should take action against what were clearly offences of incitement to murder.\n \n At the height of the protests on Friday demonstrators chanted slogans threatening more London bombings, praising the \"magnificent\" 9/11 hijackers and waving placards saying \"Massacre those who insult Islam\", \"Europe you will pay\" and \"Europe you'll come crawling when Mujahideen come roaring\".\n \n \n <<SNIP<<\n \n \n Ungratefull bastards, aren't they?",

   "On Friday 500 demonstrators marched from Regent's Park Mosque to the Danish embassy in Knightsbridge to protest at the publication of \"blasphemous\" cartoons in a Danish newspaper, and subsequently in other countries and on the BBC.\n \n Yesterday, more than 1,000 demonstrators staged a second protest outside the embassy. The only arrests made were of two men found carrying cartoons of Mohammed. Police said they had been detained \"to prevent a breach of the peace\".\n\n We have 1.6 million Muslims in the UK.

   "Indeed. And even in Bradford, of Salman Rushdie fame, the papers could hardly find anyone who was not offended, but could hardly find anyone who condoned violence for these reasons.\n \n I suspect that the protests in Britain are people who already have these opinions and are trying to incite others. It is questionable whether locking them up will help or damage the general Muslims' views.",
