Sorry but an art major is not going to be able to pay off 52k in student loans. \n \n But you are right, the federal government encouraged lenders to lend out every dime they had and the businesses wanted to do it because they got rich and the people wanted it because they HAD to have the newest McMansion in Bambi's old stomping grounds. So now we have the other extreme because the banks are scared the feds will come down on them if they make a loan to someone. Furthermore, most Americans are STILL saddled with debt so the hopes of making a reasonable loan are already out. \n \n By the way, student loan debt EXCEEDS credit card debt now.\n \n I'm not seeing the benefit of this QE2 or whatever they call it.",
