No UN resolution, no Congressional votes, no complaints from the left. \n \n Clinton tooks us to fight dictators killing thousands in their countries over and over. Not a word from the left. Saddam is doing the same...words from the left.\n \n I'm tired...I'll add later.",

   "\"9th Circuit Upholds Pledge Decision\n \n Legal Update Solidifying its reputation as a \"runaway train of liberal activism,\" the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit last week refused to reconsider its controversial decision over the Pledge of Allegiance.\n \n The case was brought by Sacramento atheist-activist Michael Newdow who argued that his second-grade daughter was \"injured\" by having to listen to the words \"one nation 'under God'\" being recited by classmates. It has since been widely reported that Newdow's daughter is a Christian, who willingly recited the full Pledge in class and who regularly attends church with her mother, Sandra Banning, with whom Newdow is embroiled in a custody dispute. \" - CFIF\n \n This case is not about church/state, not about child welfare, it is about a custody battle, and this schmuck is using his child as a weapon against his mother.",
