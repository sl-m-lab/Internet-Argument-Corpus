   "MMMM...Starburst...MMM...Skittles... Why don't they make a candy thats a combination of them? I mean, they're both fruity... But having to make a choice, I would say Starburst by far. For a few reasons\n 1) If anyone wants some of your candy, you can give them ONE wrapped starburst vs. a HANDFULL of skittles\n 2)If you don't want to eat them all at the same time, you don't have to! It is so hard to keep skittles in their bag... maybe they should be resealable too.\n 3)Sometimes the candy coating on skittles is simply annoying to my teeth.\n 4)I'm just rambling on now, but did I at least make some sort of point? :)\n \n -KaiRakasha",
