   "I hope you guys don't mind, I just signed up less than a half an hour ago and I noticed all the other abortion debates have already come a long way which would make it difficult for me to become involved. I am pro-life and I would love to explore this issue a bit with someone who isn't.\n \n I'll start with a few questions. First of all, which premise of the following syllogism do you disagree with? Why?\n \n 1. It is wrong to intentionally kill innocent human beings.\n 2. Abortion intentionally kills an innocent human being.\n 3. Therefore abortion is wrong.\n \n Second, do you believe there is such a thing as right and wrong? Most pro-abortionists I've met have said yes, however I'd like to make sure.\n \n Third, do you believe the fetus is a human? Why? Let me be very clear on this term. By the term human I simply mean it is a member of the human species.\n \n Fourth, do you believe the fetus is living? Why?\n \n Fifth, do you believe the fetus is a person? Why?\n \n I think that's enough to start us out.",

   "\n \n 1. It is wrong to ntentionally kill innocent human beings.\n\n \n Of course.\n \n \n2. Abortion intentionally kills an innocent human being.\n\n \n No, it doesn't. To imply innocence there also must be the possibility of guilt. A fetus is neither guilty nor innocent of anything. And it is not a human being even if it has human DNA. It is only a potential human being.\n \n \n3. Therefore abortion is wrong.\n\n \n Nope.\n \n \nSecond, do you believe there is such a thing as right and wrong?\n\n \n Yes, but all concepts of right or wrong are subjective.\n \n \nMost pro-abortionists I've met have said yes, however I'd like to make sure.\n\n \n Most people are not pro-abortion, they are pro-choice. No one here is going around demanding that women must have abortions.\n \n \nThird, do you believe the fetus is a human? Why? Let me be very clear on this term. By the term human I simply mean it is a member of the human species.\n\n \n Having human DNA does not necessarily make one a human being. Transgenic animals can have human DNA, does that make them human beings.\n \n \nFourth, do you believe the fetus is living? Why?\n\n \n We've said that it is living, but that it wasn't a life.\n \n \nFifth, do you believe the fetus is a person? Why?\n\n \n It isn't a person because it doesn't have a higher brain necessary for a mind to form in.\n \n \nI think that's enough to start us out.\n\n \n We've answered these questions already over and over again and you'll get the same ones as well.",

Sometimes all it needs is the brain stem which contains the autonomic systems to keep it going.\n \n You could replace every single system in your body and still be a person as long as you have your mind. Even when we'll be able to transfer the mind to a completely cybernetic body it wil still be a person. A person is not their body, but their mind. The body is only what carries the mind.
