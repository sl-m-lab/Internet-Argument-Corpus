   "Communism-------------Liberalism---------Conservatism--------------Fascism\n \n I find this left-right spectrum so confusing. There are so many problems with it. For one thing, the opposite ends are very, very similar - both communism and fascism involve beating the people with bludgeons, only under communism they are called \"the people's bludgeons.\" Some people depict the spectrum as a circle, then, with communism and fascism converging, but that still does not cover all of the other problems with this old-fashioned model.\n \n The biggest problem with this spectrum is that it fails to cover all political ideologies. There are many people who cannot be definitely placed at a point on this spectrum. I am admittedly one of these people. I support personal freedoms, so I must be a liberal. I oppose taxes, so I must be a conservative. I support land reform, so I must be a socialist.\n \n Whole ideological categories, such as anarchism and libertarianism, do not exist according to the left-right spectrum.\n \n I can go so far as to say that the very concept of a political spectrum of any sort - even that libertarian diamond floating around these days - is inherently constraining. One-dimensional spectrums force us to think in terms of false dilemmas. Two-dimensional spectrums force us to think inside the box. Political spectrums are used as political tools in two different ways:\n \n 1) To force us to think in terms of false dilemmas, theses and antitheses, without considering a synthesis - to glorify one extreme by demonizing the other.\n \n 2) To give a certain ideology the holy resonance of \"the Aristotellian wisdom of moderation\" - to give social democracy the label of \"centrism.\"\n \n So the political spectrum is political fraud.",

   "\n So the political spectrum is political fraud.\n\n \n I don't think the political spectrum is political, I think it's an attempt at higher level classifcation of general political \"chunks\" that are intended to make discussion of politics more efficient, and decisions easier for people who don't have time to know what they want (sheeple). As you say, it's reasonable to suggest it falls short of that goal. Just as the food pyramid does, just as saying skinny is healthy, fat is unhealthy etc.\n \n Do you think the average american would be better served by:\n \n 1. No spectrum/generalized classification\n 2. A more specific and complex spectrum/classification\n \n You're right to suggest that such a generalized spectrum, with such poorly defined terms (liberal, etc.), is woefully inadequate to make intelligent decisions or discussion. Then again, intelligent discussions involving politics don't generally rely on either the spectrum you refer to, or the inadequate terms. Secondly, why would people who do not want to spend time gaining knowledge of politics or make serious decisions about how they want their government to function, care about having a good \"spectrum\" defined or not?\n \n You can see this on the forums. Anyone bashing liberals is often asked to define liberal, since many of us don't know what they mean when they say it. We then ask \"so who are these \"liberals\", and are can they be liberal on some issues and conservative on others?\" It generally takes just a few questions to recognize no intelligent discussion can take place with such a limited toolbox, or worse, with such a limited user of the tool.\n \n -Mach",

No false dilemmas, like liberty------equality, but actual mutually exclusive terms, like liberty-------tyranny or equality-------inequality.\n \n Even such spectrums, though, are only useful in distinguishing the extremes. They are useless in distinguishing the \"qualifying\" positions - that is, the positions in between. For example, take the liberty-tyranny spectrum. Both modern liberals and olde-tyme conservatives would be somewhere in the middle, but they are different in their advocacy of tyranny - the former advocates the tyranny of the mixed economy, while the latter advocates moralism. We can split the liberty axis into a Nolan-style diamond, but then we would also need property axes, democracy axes, and a bunch of other axes to put all consistent ideologies as points.\n \n So ultimately, to effectively reduce politics to spectrums, we will need crazy five or six-dimensional models that cannot be imagined by sane people.",
