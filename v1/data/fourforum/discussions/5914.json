   "Well, since I am being lazy I will just give you a brief story.\n \n I knew someone pretty close to me that had an abortion and her story was the reason why I became pro-choice. I remember having a discussion with my friend about this and he was pro-life. This was about 10yrs ago. Later on I realized that this lady was actually forced in a way to get an abortion because she felt no other choice (presure from family and community). I didn't really think about it much at the time and many years passed before I revisited the issue. In college I had a roommate that was pro-life and he would frequently do things to spread the word about being pro-life. He never said anything to me nor did he ask my opinion or force me to talk about the issue. However, I saw his passion for the subject and I figured I might want to revisit the issue because it someone is that concerned about something then it might be worth looking into. So I began asking questions such as \"what about rape, incest\" and the normal questions asked on these forums. I also read up a lot on pro-choice and pro-life websites. A main things I saw was how pro-life people conducted themselves as opposed to how pro-choice people conducted themselves (in general). Pro-life people TENDED to be fairly kind, less selfish, and other traits common with religious people (but they were not all religious). Pro-chioce people seemed to nice however they were more concerned about themselves as opposed to others. They seemed to place a value on the \"I\" as opposed to the \"you\". This was just an observation I made and by no means reflects everyone. So after conducting much research and talking to my roommate often I realized that a value on human life has to be a top priority for anything to really work in our world. This alone has led to everything else falling into place. When one can structure what they believe and realize the value system they have then they will be consistent and a better overall person. I have noticed a change in myself actually. I have noticed that guy on the side of the road that is poor, I actually stop for the people on the side of the road with a flat tire, I don't see people as worse or better then me and I see what is meant by \"we are all equal\". So basically after I saw that the unborn is a person I realized it is equal to me and deserves to live as I do. People talk about rape and incest and things like that and all of these things are terrible but none are worth killing an innocent life. I don't see any gain in destroying two lives because of the greed of another. I feel as if I am a lucky person to have met the person that gave me insite into abortion and many other issues. I have my thoughts about how all of this happened but that is for another time, I will just say that we all need to open our ears because their is Someone talking.",

   "Why? How are they related?\n\n \n Too many children in the world who do not get the attention/care they deserve. Why add unwanted children to this mess? I'd feel much better if someone who was to adopt my child instead adopted a child that was already born, and suffering.\n \n \n \n \n I take it you are not a religious person then. However, you are still only half the \"creator\". Beyond this, does this mean my mom can kill me right now and it should be ok? You then ask who am I to decide it should...well, when did I say I should decide? I think we should ask the person that is being slaughtered what his/her opinion on the matter is. Before you say it doesn't have an opinion I will answer that it still doesn't give you a right to make a choice for him/her. If the child can't speak right now you must wait until he/she can and has the ability to think before asking. By that time you couldn't abort it anyway and thus it makes no sense to have abortion legal.\n\n \n I am a religious person in the typically understood fashion. Long story, not for this debate. \n Yes, I'm only half the creator. Unfortunately, I am fully responsible for the continued care. In my body. So yes, it is my perogative to decide what should happen to my body. Thus, I do have the right to make a choice. Until we have some sort of artificial wombs or surrogate system I get to say what happens. \n \n \n I mean, when a women says abortion should be legal because no one should tell her what to do then it seems hypocritical to then turn around and tell the child that she is carrying that it must now die. In other words, you don't want people making a decision for you  but you wish to make a decision for someone else. \n\n \n No, I want people to make a decision for themself. It's the ol' -Don't like abortion? Don't get one. But don't stand in someone's way because you personally disagree with the practice. I personally disagree with drinking milk. I believe it's bad for you and contributes to the decline of people's health. Numerous studies have been done to show it harmful. I don't drink milk nor do I smoke. But I'm not trying to inhibit someone's right to do so. I tell people, \"hey, milk's bad and here's why...\" but I don't think it should be made illegal b/c people own their bodies, if nothing else.\n \n \n Once again, thinking in this \"absolute\" way is not going to work. To say someone can only be against someone with they spend 100% of their time trying to solve the problem is just not going to happen. You mentioned the \"starving kids\" but I don't see you spending 100% of your time trying to solve that. There are not many anti-abortionists that look down upon people and the ones that do are hypocritical and I do not stand with them (which is why I quit this one pro-life group). To say pro-life people aren't helping is just not true and that kind of thinking seems like a rationalization to me..but thats just my opinion.\n\n \n I didn't say \"100%\" of your time, now did I?\n I didn't say I was spending 100% of my time solving starving children's problems. One should not assume anything, however...you know what happens...you make an arse out of you...\n By the way, I DID help by not becoming another single mother on welfare. Instead I get to continue my education to be a teacher.\n \n Hmmm...I was thinking about what you said about rationalizating abortion b/c anti-abortion folks don't support single mums after birth. I was thinking \"that's loony\" but I think something with merit is there. There are poor support services for women after birth (has nothing to do with anti-abortionists though-it's just everyone.) So...we get better systems in place...jobs with childcare subsidies, flexibilities with scheduling, understanding and empathetic bosses, no penalties for child-related caring.

   "Winston: \"by definition [altruism] cannot exist\" means that the concept as defined is incoherent in practice.\n \n In the casual sense provided by dictionary.com, altruism (n.) is: \"Unselfish concern for the welfare of others; selflessness.\" And we can reasonably construe it such that it refers to concern for the welfare of others without profiting from that concern. \n \n But then we think about how we might express a concern for the welfare of others without somehow profiting from that concern, it seems that even the most apparently selfless act of altruism profits us somehow - typically through some sense of moral satisfaction or spiritual uplift or satisfaction of conscience. Whether an act is really an act of 'altruism', as ordinarily defined, is an open question whose answer is contingent upon what is considered profitable. \n \n Take Mother Teresa for example, and her altruistic action in Calcutta. It could be said that her actions were not truly altruistic because they satisfied a desire of hers: to help the needy. \n \n Denying the existence of altruism then is simply denying the existence whatever the term 'altruism' refers to when it is defined as: \"Unselfish concern for the welfare of others; selflessness.\" or something similar.",

I wouldn't call this to 'profit' from their actions. I think your definition of profit and altruism is so twisted that of course it makes altruism impossible.

But since you obviously want me to do it, I'll see what I can do. \n \n Step One, Primitives\n This step defines the meaning and structure of the definition. \n \n For primitive symbols, we'll take all of the words in the english language, plus grammar markers, and so on to be our set of constants, variables, predicates, and operators. Dictionary.com and Thesaurus.com will stand in as our lists of these primitive terms. \n \n Certain syntactic conventions will apply such that:\n 'either...or' will denote exclusive disjunction\n 'both...and' will denote conjunction \n 'and/or' will denote inclusive disjunction\n 'if...then' will denote the conditional\n 'not' will denote negation\n 'if and only if' will denote the biconditional\n 'all', 'some', 'none' will denote quantifiers\n and so on. \n \n Step Two, Examples\n This step gives us paradigmatic examples of the concept to which the term in question is attached.\n \n 1. Mother Teresa's actions in Calcutta.\n \n 2. Giving money to charity.\n \n 3. Feeding others before yourself.\n \n There probably better ones out there, and please feel free to suggest some. \n \n Step Three, Initial Definition\n This set is to provide a ballpark string of primitive terms from which the analysis may begin. \n \n Altruism (n.): \"Unselfish concern for the welfare of others; selflessness.\"\n \n Step Four, Substitutions\n This set is where the work is done. Primitive terms are substituted for synonymous terms, according to the arrangement of our lists of primitive terms. A word is substituted with another, and the meaning of the aggregate (though not the primitive parts) is considered in relation to the examples given as paradigmatic.\n \n 1a. The first primitive symbol is 'unselfish', synonyms are \"altruistic, benevolent, charitable, chivalrous, denying, devoted, disinterested, extroverted, generous, giving, helpful, humanitarian, incorruptible, indulgent, liberal, loving, magnanimous, noble, open-handed, self-effacing, self-forgetting, self-sacrificing, selfless\"\n \n 1b. The various permutations: \n i. Benevolent concern for the welfare of others; selflessness.\n ii. Charitable concern for the welfare of others; selflessness.\n iii. Chivalrous concern for the welfare of others; selflessness.\n iv. Denying concern for the welfare of others; selflessness.\n v. Devoted concern for the welfare of others; selflessness.\n vi. Disinterested concern for the welfare of others; selflessness.\n vii. Extroverted concern for the welfare of others; selflessness.\n viii. Generous concern for the welfare of others; selflessness.\n ix. Giving concern for the welfare of others; selflessness.\n x. Helpful concern for the welfare of others; selflessness.\n xi. Humanitarian concern for the welfare of others; selflessness.\n xii. Incorruptible concern for the welfare of others; selflessness.\n xiii. Indulgent concern for the welfare of others; selflessness.\n xiv. Liberal concern for the welfare of others; selflessness.\n xv. Loving concern for the welfare of others; selflessness.\n xvi. Magnanimous concern for the welfare of others; selflessness.\n xvii. Noble concern for the welfare of others; selflessness.\n xviii. Open-handed concern for the welfare of others; selflessness.\n xix. Self-effacing concern for the welfare of others; selflessness.\n xx. Self-forgetting concern for the welfare of others; selflessness.\n xxi. Self-sacrificing concern for the welfare of others; selflessness.\n xxii. Selfless concern for the welfare of others; selflessness.\n \n 1c. Objections:\n i. Duplication.\n ii. Duplication. \n iii. Duplication.\n iv. Confused.\n v. None. \n vi. Inconsistent.\n vii. Inconsistent. \n viii. None.\n ix. None.\n x. None. \n xi. None.\n xii. Inconsistent.\n xiii. Inconsistent.\n xiv. Confused.\n xv. Duplication.\n xvi. Duplication.\n xvii. Duplication.\n xviii. Duplication.\n xix. Duplication.\n xx. Duplication.\n xxi. Duplication. \n xxii. Duplication.\n \n Duplication is where a synonymous term is synonymous with a different term, a problem of amphiboly.\n \n Inconsistent is where a synonymous term is antonymous with a different term, a problem of the excluded middle.\n \n Confused is where the sense of a synonymous term is different from the original term. \n \n None is where both the sense and the reference of a term is apparently preserved through substitution.\n \n Of xxii synonyms, only [v, vii-xi] appear to preserve the meaning of the string. These terms will be held over to Step Five. \n \n 2a. The first primitive symbol is 'concern', synonyms are: \"affair, burden, care, charge, company, corporation, deportment, enterprise, establishment, field, firm, house, interest, involvement, job, jungle, matter, mission, multinational, occupation, organization, outfit, responsibility, shooting match, task, thing, transaction, worry.\"\n \n 2b. As 1b, except substituting synonyms for the second term in the string. \n \n 2c. As 1c.\n \n Etc, as many sets of sub-steps as terms in initial definition (5 in this case).\n \n Step Five, Construction of Definition \n Using the sets of synonymous terms derived by Step 4, all combinations of these synonyms are constructed and those that fit the paradigmatic examples comprise the effective definition of 'altruism'.",

   "Well, since I am being lazy I will just give you a brief story.\n \n I knew someone pretty close to me that had an abortion and her story was the reason why I became pro-choice. I remember having a discussion with my friend about this and he was pro-life. This was about 10yrs ago. Later on I realized that this lady was actually forced in a way to get an abortion because she felt no other choice (presure from family and community). I didn't really think about it much at the time and many years passed before I revisited the issue. In college I had a roommate that was pro-life and he would frequently do things to spread the word about being pro-life. He never said anything to me nor did he ask my opinion or force me to talk about the issue. However, I saw his passion for the subject and I figured I might want to revisit the issue because it someone is that concerned about something then it might be worth looking into. So I began asking questions such as \"what about rape, incest\" and the normal questions asked on these forums. I also read up a lot on pro-choice and pro-life websites. A main things I saw was how pro-life people conducted themselves as opposed to how pro-choice people conducted themselves (in general). Pro-life people TENDED to be fairly kind, less selfish, and other traits common with religious people (but they were not all religious). Pro-chioce people seemed to nice however they were more concerned about themselves as opposed to others. They seemed to place a value on the \"I\" as opposed to the \"you\". This was just an observation I made and by no means reflects everyone. So after conducting much research and talking to my roommate often I realized that a value on human life has to be a top priority for anything to really work in our world. This alone has led to everything else falling into place. When one can structure what they believe and realize the value system they have then they will be consistent and a better overall person. I have noticed a change in myself actually. I have noticed that guy on the side of the road that is poor, I actually stop for the people on the side of the road with a flat tire, I don't see people as worse or better then me and I see what is meant by \"we are all equal\". So basically after I saw that the unborn is a person I realized it is equal to me and deserves to live as I do. People talk about rape and incest and things like that and all of these things are terrible but none are worth killing an innocent life. I don't see any gain in destroying two lives because of the greed of another. I feel as if I am a lucky person to have met the person that gave me insite into abortion and many other issues. I have my thoughts about how all of this happened but that is for another time, I will just say that we all need to open our ears because their is Someone talking.\n\n You did quote very bang on that \"a value on human life has to be the top priority for anything to really work in our world\", well mate that also is called humanity which on my view should represent the top value in life, and let me tell you that i'm very much so in accordance with this that there you've said, hopefully people who there be passing up on this situation may bear in mind this that just above you have said to miss so many unborn children unjustified killings.",

   "I will be more clear. Intentional killing of one deemed innocent is usually unacceptable. I guess innocent can be a subjective term, but let's use the word as the law would apply it. Assume a fetus is a viable human being. It falls within the parameters of what has been labeled an innocent victim. All I am trying to say is that within the U.S. justice system's version of innocence and guilt, intentional killing of an innocent is somewhat frowned upon. Abortion, at this point, has not been established to be something other than the killing of an innocent human being. Why is it not frowned upon in the same way?",

   "Steeeeve: \n \n Let me try again. There are three different things at work here: \n \n i. Terms,\n ii. Definitions of terms,\n iii. Referents of terms. \n \n The terms, propositions or statements, of an argument are like labels in that they denote some semantic object.\n \n Definitions are representations of what a term denotes. \n \n Referents of terms are the things which terms label and definitions describe.\n \n Trying to make arguments about the objects that terms label by resorting to the definitions of those terms, such as making an arguement by definition, is absurd because definitions beg the question with regard to the meaning of semantic objects. \n \n It is equivalent to trying to pass a picture of a thing off as the thing itself, absurd. \n \n Now, what we want to do is talk about those objects being represented, rather than the way in which they are represented. \n \n Objects are subject specific things. Numbers, for example, are objects in mathematics. Spatio-temporal objects are objects in empirical science. Humans are objects of the subject of biology. Persons are objects in both the arts of ethics and law. We refer to the subjects of those objects to give us paradigm examples of those objects. \n \n Conceptual analysis with reference to subject specific paradigm examples will give us a collection of terms to let us identify the object about which we will speak. In biology we talk about human, masses of flesh and bone and whatnot, distinguished by a set of empirical properties. In law and ethics we talk about persons, things distinguished by a set of legal or ethical properties.\n \n Obviously humans are physical things that we use the term 'human' to denote and use biological terms to define. Likewise persons are social things that we use the term 'person' to denote and use legal terms to define.\n \n Humans are not persons because humans are different things than persons. Much like colours and rocks are different things, or Bill Gates and the richest man in America are different things. \n \n Which should answer your question about the difference in these terms, namely that they refer to different things, not merely a difference in token but also a token in type. You're familiar with the type/token distinction I hope. \n \n Moving on to answer your first reductio example: a feline is a cat because 'feline' and 'cat' both denote the same object, a type of animal.\n \n Likewise your second reductio example of 'person' being redefined to exclude blacks is correct in the sense that the set of objects denoted by the term 'person' has been can be changed as the institution of personhood for corporations demonstrates. However, it is incorrect in supposing that this is because the definition of the term as changed. A definition, as I keep noting, is merely a description and as such is vulnerable to error as well as not being what the term actually denotes.",

There is no straw-man arguement when saying that you think abortion is wrong because the fetus is a person and thus you feel abortion is wrong. \n \n First off we already stated that all humans can be said to be persons. You then argue that this not true because we can have non-persons (another made up meaningless term). You referred to these as a and ~a(not a) respectably. So if a fetus is 'a'...a human then this should automatically qualify it to be a person. So therefore we got the person part. However, you say it can be ~a and then somehow a non-person. So from what I understand a fetus can be a person and non-person at the same time with your logic. This is true, unless we say that non-person is a subset of person just like human is. In this case, fetus is classified under two things both equaling person. The latter, I believe, is the one you refer to eventhough one would think nonperson would be the opposite of person. \n \n From this we can go into many places....For one we can get techincal about it and say 'person' is in the 14th amendment and thus the fetus has rights. Or we can go with what you said eariler...that you believe it is ok to pick and choose what people we kill (based on what??? I have no idea...stage of development maybe?).

You may have noticed that we began this discussion talking about terms and what they mean. The definition of the term 'person', according to our legal source, included two things, 'humans' and 'corporations'. As I pointed out such a definitional identity was doomed from the start as definitions are not the things that they represent.\n \n And then I explained how terms refer to objects, those things which defiitions represent, and which are subject-specific.

But again it was demonstrated that these terms 'human' and 'person' refer to different sets of entities such that any identity made between them is entirely a contingent matter. Note the abandonment of a discussion of terms and their definitions for a discussion of terms and their referents, and the reasons thereof. \n \n As you may have noticed, I am not trying to \"rationalize abortion by saying it is neither human nor person\" but rather I have been trying to explain how any arguments that rely on identifying foeti as persons, either for or against abortion, are bad arguments. \n \n I'm not sure why you thought I was trying to rationalize abortion, as I can quote myself at length from previous posts where I explicitly point out that I'm arguing against a necessary identity between humans and persons, rather than for or against abortion. Thinking that abortion is wrong because it kills a person is just as muddled as thinking that abortion is permissable because it does not kill a person. \n \n But to answer your question, I support the murder of persons like I support the artificial abortion of persons, as and where necessary such as self-defense, duty, accident, and euthanasia.",

But I do think that we need to treat people with equal respect in regard to their being persons. Since all else is rarely equal, and there are so many differences with the sameness of personhood, why should it be inconsistent to treat equal persons differently where different circumstances warrant? Or even the same person different depending on what is going on? \n \n\n \n Person referred to something different prior to 1937...did it just magically change to mean different things?\n \n Your arguement is that we shouldn't argue about whether or not a fetus is a person or human or none of the above. But this arguement seems to be very valid. You use the term \"person\" in a way that you give 'respect' to it and thus would not want to kill this person. So saying that the fetus is a person would then make it so he/she gets this respect and thus not killed. Most people feel this way and this is why we don't support murder. It is also why people try to justify abortion by trying to make a distinction between human and person. They feel more comfortable saying the fetus is a human but not a person thus it doesn't violate their beliefs.

   "Steeeeve:\n \n I have been quite clear about my position, and I have tried to carefully explain it. Indeed, post #131 summarizes it. \nNo, it's not a safe assumption to make as I have already explicitly mentioned that I believe abortion to be about a conflict between persons, whose most equitable resolution to date is the removal of a person from another person, and the former's slaughter.\n \n Were we able to preserve the life of a fetus prematurely removed from its mother, then we should do so. Killing it is merely the preferable option to letting it die a slower death.\n \n As it stands we do not yet have that capability, and in order to preserve the most equitable defense of persons and their rights we must kill these foeti, these persons, in abortion procedures where the mother demands it.\nI can quote you previous posts where I explicate my position. I would have thought my position was clear to the casual reader. To repeat: What matters is whether the balance of rights that provides the most equitable protection for persons entails that we defend of a woman's right to self-determination at the expense of a person's life in the case of abortion, and that balance does entail such a dogged defense.\n \n There is also a more finely detailed 'nuts-and-bolts' elaboration of my position in the thread entitled \" At what point are we called human?\"\n \n Given these representations you can see why suggesting that my position is that all that matters is the will of the mother is a 'straw-man caricature'. \n \n Now, to the matter of stem-cell research. My claims about stem-cell research are substantiated claims, that is to say strong inductive claims, that the results of such results will have an incredible positive impact. As I said before, I invite you to offer evidence that these are weak claims. I will provide some citations are evidence that these are strong claims:\n \n http://www.state.nj.us/scitech/stem_research.html\n http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=12210531&dopt=Abstract\n \n Now, onto the issue of Nazis. As a student of ethics, I feel quite confident to say that the results of Nazi experimentation on Jewish concentration camp was wrong and that the Nazi opinion that such lives spent were worth it is wrong. Much like I feel confident that the lives of the Allied soldiers who liberated such camps were well spent. \n \n In claiming these things without providing an explanation for how they are so, I am begging the question, so let me provide one according to a stricly consequentialist account according to expected value comparisons: \n \n 1. Take the number of Jewish lives lost to Nazi medical experimentation. Let's say 6,000,000 as an effective estimate for the period between 1938-1946. Adjust the cost of that loss of life to account for the degradation that those Jews suffered through those experiments and the circumstances surrounding them using a multiplier, say 100x. Multiply this number further by the likelihood of those Jews suffering and dying at the hands of the Nazis, 100% or 1.0 \n \n 2. Take the number of lives saved as a result of Nazi medical experimentation. Let's say 1,000,000 of the following two centuries. Adjust that benefit to account for the number of lives that have been improved as a result of Nazi medical experimentation, say 100x. Multiply this number further by the likelihood of those lives having been saved or improved as a result of said Nazi medical experimentation, 100% or 1.0 \n \n 3. Place the costs and benefits together as a ratio which will leave you with a rough estimate of the worth of those Nazi medical experiments. I'd suggest that accurate numbers for these costs and benefits would yield a negative ratio, but for the sake of not making a forgone conclusion let's suppose instead that things turned out such that those Nazi medical experiments on Jews had an overall positive impact. \n \n Repeat with stem-cell research:\n 1. Take the number of lives that may be lost stem-cell research, say 6,000,000 over the next few years. Adjust that cost of that loss of life by the degradation in those embryos' quality of life, 20x. Multiply this number by the likelihood of such embryos being harmed, 100%, or 1.0. \n \n 2. Take the number of lives that may be saved as a result of stem-cell experimentation. Let's say 50,000,000 over the next few years. Adjust that benefit to account for the number of lives that have been improved as a result of stem-cell experimentation, say 10x. Multiply this number by the likelihood of such people existing in the next two centuries, 50% or 0.5.\n \n 3. Place the costs and benefits together as a ratio which will leave you with a rough estimate of the worth of stem-cell research. I'd suggest that accurate numbers for these costs and benefits would yield a positive ratio.\n \n Now, let us compare the two ratios keeping in mind that the margin of error in our estimated values has been controlled for by the likelihood of these values being real (people existing, embryos being harmed, etc). \n \n Nazi Experiments: 600,000,000:100,000,000, or 6:1\n Stem Cell Research: 120,000,000:250,000,000, or 12:25\n \n Even if the Nazi research saved lives, it saved them at an outrageous and immoral cost of killing or torturing 6 to save or improve 1 is morally monstrous. If stem-cell research saves lives, it saves them at a morally profitable balance of more than 2 saved or improved for 1 killed. We can't really even say that embryos are tortured, as they are harvested before any form of nervous system is developed. \n \n With regard to Nazi intentions, I have difficulty seeing how pursuing stem-cell research to benefit all of humanity is comparable to trying to prove the racial superiority of Germans, or figure out how protect Nazi soldiers against chemical weapons and adverse environmental conditions. The Nazi reasoning behind the detention and abuse of Jews was xenophobic, nationalist, and contaminated with more than a little common cruelty. Until stem-cell researchers start claiming that lesser races are ideal expendible subjects for stem-cell research, that such research is for the glory of the [insert ideologically defined race here] people, or that stem-cell research is kind of fun because you can see the little blastocysts wiggle in pain, then you're making a fallacious comparison between the two when you say they share a similar thought process. \n \n The reason why Godwin's law works, I'd say, is because people are used to tossing around the epiphet of \"Nazi\" or \"Facist\" without really understanding the motivations and politics of those groups such that they are an internet boogy-man used to demonize other people or groups of people.",

We have an opinion, UN made rights, and legal rights...\n \n I, however, believe we have rights that are granted by someone higher up and I don't believe that \"social norms\" make rights because social norms change and thus a right at one time could easily change in 10 years. To me a right is absolute or its not a right at all. My thinking is pretty much in-line with the Declarations opening remarks.\n \n However, I want to avoid a rights debate becaue those go no where and people just using philosophies greatest flaws; which include searching for ways to get to a desired answer.",

So far as I can tell it's alluded to in the 14th amendment, section 1.\n\n I find it hard to find a self-ownership right here...let take a look\n \n \n \nSection. 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. \n\n \n Well, our first part(seen in red) tells us when one is a citizen or not...thats fair enough\n \n The second part is Navy tells us how a citizen can't have a law take away the privileges and immunities of the citizens. Also pretty straight forward.\n \n Finally in green we have a state can't deprive any PERSON of life, liberty and property without DUE PROCESS OF LAW. At the end it just says we are all equally protected by the laws. However, notice life, liberty, and property are there and not self-ownership. Self ownership is a direct result from these things however where it says \"life\" is a key area. In an abortion you violate the area of the law that you claim supports abortion. This is kinda why I don't believe a right to self-ownership exists in the constitution. ANd if it did, then we could take it away via due-process of law.\n \n However, like the judges, many have seen a halo around this amendment that says \"right to privacy\" (not right to self-ownership), and they see substantive due process, another made up thing.",
