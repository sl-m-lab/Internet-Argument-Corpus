Country after country went deeply into debt to keep banks afloat and prevent a deep recession from turning into something worse.\n\n \n Here is the interesting part\n \n \nOne of the questions economists were asked to address at the conference was, Does the financial system have social value?\n \n A few years ago, that question would not have been asked at the International Monetary Fund. If it had been, the responses would have been as unanimous as might be expected if a gathering at the Vatican were to consider whether religion was a good thing.\n \n Now, there is no such unanimity. It is clear that there are functions of the financial system that must be performed, among them the allocation of capital and the setting of prices. But there is at least a suspicion that a significant part of modern finance has no real value for anyone except the participants. \n\n \n What they are essentially saying here is that it seems like a lot of the modern finance system does not create any real value....it has no real economic output. \n \n Now, I am not going to say this is too encouraging, but it is better than pre crisis when everybody would have told you that trading junk securities back and forth while assigning values to them FAR in excess of the value of the underlying assets was TOTALLY an economically productive activity. \n \n \nAdair Turner, the chairman of Britain's Financial Services Authority, spoke with wonderment of the huge volume of stock trades now made by computers using algorithms to rapidly trade in and out. Some traders, he said, were using what they called \"predatory algorithms,\" whose sole purpose is to exploit a weakness in some other trader's algorithm and get it to make an unprofitable trade.\n \n \"It is quite difficult to work out the social benefit of that,\" he said. \n\n \n Gee....do you think?? \n \n \nAnd of course, there is also the fact that the financial system did not accomplish what it was supposed to do. \"At the core of these functions is the ability to find and set the right price, including the extent to which it reflects risk,\" Antonio Borges, an I.M.F. official and former vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International, told the conference. \"This is not really a question of financial sophistication, of complex products or greedy bankers. It is a question of getting the prices wrong.\"\n \n He added, \"It is unbelievable how wrong they were.\" \n\n \n In a way I disagree with this. It had a LOT to do with complex products. The products essentially got so \"complex\" that they were completely detached from anything resembling an underlying assets. They were essentially nothing more than complex theories...and our entire economy rested on them. \n \n In a lot of ways it still does because the fed and the government turned around and paid face value for them. \n \n \nPerhaps the most important error made early in the crisis was a decision by Henry Paulson, then the United States Treasury secretary, to put pressure on big banks to accept bailouts whether they needed them or not. The idea was to avoid making acceptance of such money a scarlet letter that would in itself alarm depositors and investors. It seemed to make sense. \n\n \n You know, when you say it like that it almost sounds legal. In the real world he colluded with banks to hide from investors and depositors material adverse financial information about the banks. His fraud was roughly 1000x what Madoff did.",

If a stock goes from $1 to $10 a share the company receives $0 of that. In fact, the stock is basically independent of the company on some levels. \n \n Anyway, what is said about the banking industry is basically the same thing.

If a stock goes from $1 to $10 a share the company receives $0 of that. In fact, the stock is basically independent of the company on some levels. \n\n \n And independent of the value of the company on all levels. \n \n If you are buying a stock that pays dividends (as stocks were supposed to), then you are purchasing that income stream so paying more than base value (assets-liabilities) makes sense because you are buying base value plus future cash. \n \n Buying a stock that does not pay dividends for more than base value does not actually make any sense. A company that does not pay dividends is, from an investors point of view, a sealed cash box. No matter how much cash you end up with on the inside it does not actually matter because you cannot actually GET to it. \n \n Companies have figured out over the last several decades that they can get away without paying dividends because speculators will still buy their stocks (yes....I just called every stock investor in the country a speculator). Whats more, most of them retain shares of their stock any time they make a new offering, so once the speculators have driven their share price up they can dump their retained stock on the market. \n \n We have basically ended up with a system where our entire stock market is devoid of reality. It runs by its own set of rules that dont really make any sense. How many times have you heard that a company is \"worth\" 17x earnings??? Walk into a bank and tell them that you want to buy a business, and you want to pay 17x earnings and they will laugh you out of there. That is just not how the world works. \n \n \nAnyway, what is said about the banking industry is basically the same thing. There is no value added when you pass paper back in forth with a higher number on the \"price\" line. \n \n The question becomes, how do you fix a problem like this? Wait for things to crash? I'm looking into the possibility of taxing short-term capital gains at 75% among other things.\n \n \n At the end of the day your biggest industry shouldn't be passing papers, if we don't fix that we are in trouble.\n\n \n I wish they had not used the term \"social benefit\" because too many Americans will read it and pass it off as whacky socialist ideas from a bunch of Europeans. People dont understand that in a properly functioning economy every transaction essentially provides positive benefit for the entire economy. If a man buys a pig in S Dakota, there is an entire line of people who benefit from that purchase in some small way. Everybody from the guy who sells the seed to grow the feed that the pig eats to the factory worker who makes the dress that the guy who sold the pig buys for his wife with the money he got for it. \n \n IF, on the other hand, 2 bankers come up with a derivatives scheme that allows them to trade the same piece of paper back and forth with progressively bigger numbers on it, each financing against the paper with each transaction so actual money is created in the process, the impact may be positive for those 2 bankers, but it is negative to everybody else in the country because money has been created without any underlying asset creation, so it is inflationary money creation. Yes....thats right....all those imaginary transactions that wall street makes are screwing us all on an individual basis.",

Taylor\n You may not have heard of the Federal Reserve system but it exists to inflate and deflate the currency supply through the housing market. They inflated too much for too long. This caused what they call a housing bubble. While the bubble was inflating all the big banks and many insurance companies bought bubble mortgages thinking they were sound rather than merely purchased or made possible by newly printed funny money. When the bubble deflated they all lost money on the mortgages. It would be analogous to the government making cars and giving them to GM so everyone could have a car. If GM got them by the ton and for very little money of course they would find a way to move them . This is essentially what the Banks did with the free money. In addition to the Federal Reserve System you had Fanny and Freddie which bought and guaranteed many of the mortgages so no one had to worry about them failing. Then you had CRA, FHA, Federal Home Loan Bank Board( 3% down payment loans) and several others that were designed to get everybody in their own home.\n \n When the states tried to move against predatory lending by national banks they were blocked by the bank's federal regulator, the office of the comptroller of the currency, That empowered money lenders say Lynn Turner.\n \n Just as significantly you had very badly conceived accounting rules that hid the problems from everyone until it was too late. Accounting rules are supposed to do the opposite, not move billions in potential liabilities off the balance sheet onto tiny footnote on the bottom of a page as happened at Citibank, or onto on sentence at the end of a 10-Q report as happened at AIG, or as generally happened with SIVs (structured investment vehicles). Then you had gov't rules from the last crisis, the Enron Crisis, the created mark-to- market accounting rules for this crisis that many believe greatly exacerbated this crisis.\n \n Then you had the problem with the government backed ratings agencies that simply failed to rate the mortgage backed and related securities, properly. Sorry, it had little to do with Bush, but had everything to do with inane attempts by the liberal to regulate the free market! \n \n \n Warren Buffett: \"There are significant limits to what regulation can accomplish. As a dramatic illustration, take two of the biggest accounting disasters in the past ten years: Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. We're talking billions and billions of dollars of misstatements at both places\".",
