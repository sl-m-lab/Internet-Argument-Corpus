It's very cruel!\n \n The most common pre-birth abortion is called a Surgical Abortion, which literally means to cut the child up. They stick scisors inside the vaginal tube, and slowly cut off the limbs, trying hard not to punctuate the mother's womb. Next, they cut off the head and cut up the torso, so that they can bring the parts out.\n \n The next most common method is a use of a chemical called Prostaglandin. This adds hormones and makes an extremely violent labor to occur, so violent that the baby actually is then born dead. Basically, it makes the baby have seizure-type kickings trying to get out. \n \n There is also another called Salt Poisoning, where the doctor sticks salt into the amnotic fluid, and the baby breathes in the salt causing dehidration, brain damage, convultions and soon, death. This is an extremely cruel way to kill the child. \n \n Suction Aspiration is used only in the first trimester, when they put a vaccum in the mother's vaginal tube and suck the baby into the vaccum, breaking the baby into bits in the process. \n \n A Hysterotomy is performed in the third trimester and it basically a C-section. The baby is then placed to the side to die, or the nurse (or doctor) will kill the baby.",

As a result, the tiny developing baby literally starves to death as the nutrient lining of the womb sloughs off, and muscular contractions cause the dead baby to be expelled from the uterus. It is used to induce abortions between the fifth to ninth weeks of pregnancy. Women first take RU486 alone. Within 48 hours, only three percent have a completed abortion. The remainder of the women, ninety-seven percent, must take a second powerful drug, a prostaglandin. In approximately five to ten percent of the women who use the RU486 abortion method, the drugs fail to kill the developing baby and the women usually have follow-up surgical abortions. RU486 can cause severe disabilities in babies who survive the abortion, can injure and possibly kill women, and could harm a woman's subsequent offspring. Preliminary findings of the first independent studies reveal serious under- reporting of the abortion technique's adverse side effects. With RU486, a mother will more directly participate in ending the life of her unborn child, and verify that she has passed the \"uterine content\" that is her dead baby. Nearly half of the French women polled report that they find this verification process disturbing.\n \n \n http://www.ortl.org/abortion/abortion_methods.htm",

   "I'm not going to really go into the abortion debate right now, since I'm still trying to make up my own mind about it. The comments here have been insightful, tho, so thanks, everyone :)\n \n I would, however, like to make a note about the morning after pill. The morning after pill and RU-486 are two totally different things. The latter is an early stage pregnancy abortion pill which is good for the first 9 weeks of pregnancy. While I'm not sure of the exact mechanics of how it acts, it mimics a natural miscarriage. \n \n The \"morning after\" pill, is only good for 3 to 5 days after intercourse. Basically, it is series of pills, containing a coctail of concentrated birth control hormones. It can act to prevent or delay ovulation. It can also slow the transport of sperm. prevents conception which often occurs several hours or even days after intercourse (sperm can \"live\" inside you for three days or more!). The pill may also create an autoimmune response that causes the white blood cells to attack the sperm as foreign bodies. So, In this respect, they act pretty much like normal birth control. As with birth control, if an embryo has already implanted the pills have no effect.\n \n The controversy over this pill comes from the fact that in the case that the pills are taken too late and conception has already occurred, the pills can prevent implantation of the embryo. There is some argument as to the degree of their effectiveness in preventing implantaion. Some feel that even one fertilized embryo that is rejected is one too many. Others argue that even in normal women using no contraception embryos often fail to implant. This is why it often takes several months for a couple tryin for a baby to concieve. (I personally believe that the number of attempts it takes to concieve is inversely proportional to how hard you're trying for a baby *lol*) They add that since most pregancies are stopped before conception, the rate or failed implantations is close to that for women under normal conditaions.\n \n The question, I guess, is whether the zygote is merely a formless ball of undifferentiated cells, or a potential human being in the making. Its a difficult one, and as yet I have not been able to come to any descision. I would, however, love to hear your thoughts on it.\n \n Sheryll",

Therefore, it can kill a baby and is wrong.\n \n \n The question, I guess, is whether the zygote is merely a formless ball of undifferentiated cells, or a potential human being in the making.

Of course; if it's not a human being, what is it? Is it a squirrel? Is it a moose? Is it an elephant? Of course not; it's a human. You see, humans reproduce after their own kind. Dogs make dogs; cats make cats; humans make humans, et cetera secula seculorum. Humans don't have sex and then produce a knew species; it is always human. Now, you may argue that it's part of the mother. If it is, that means the limbs are part of the mother as well, which means the mother has four arms, four legs, two different blood types, two brains, two noses, four eyes, and if the fetus is a boy, a penis and vagina, or if it's a girl, two vaginas. This is simply impossible! The baby is NOT part of the mother and IS a human being. Arguing otherwise is arguing against facts, not theories.",

(I have yet to arrive at an opinion on that score) Jews and homosexuals and Slavs are people, (I don't see any debate professing otherwise). They were seperate and independent from the womb and were capable of surviving without someone else's uterus at the point in which they were murdered. Besides, one of the most horrifying aspects of the holocaust were the reasons why those things were done. Mass genocide is different from abortion. However, I can see your point with the comparison to murder. I need to think about that one.\n \n \"Murder\" (by my definition, anyway,) is the taking of another's life... Half the horror of which is in the pain and agony in which the victim dies. Having your exoskeleton crushed and your intestined ruptured isn't painful? Being shot in the stomach mid-flight, then plummeting towards the earth to shatter your skull on the pavement isn't painful? Having sharp metal teeth clamp shut on your body while you're trying to fetch a bit of cheese isn't painful? \n \n Partial birth abortions are disgusting, and the manner in which they perform it is chilling to the core, and so I think they should continue looking for another way to do it. A way that doesn't torture the fetus. Abortion itself, i do not have a problem with, although I have mixed emotions on the topic of partial birth abortions....\n \n Alright, I'll finish posting later. I've lost my train of thought and I'm hungry.",

   "[QUOTE=punk_sushi]Maybe I'm going to be the only adamant pro-choice member on this forum. \n \n Oh, I am completely pro-choice.\n I believe that every woman should have the choice to have sex. If they choose to have sex, I believe that every woman should have the choice to use a condom, or what ever other barrier she can find to protect herself. (No, I do not believe in \"the pill\" because it can have an abortive effect on the fetus and natural family planning has the same effectiveness if learned correctly by a certified instructor).\n If a woman has unprotected sex - well then she must be choosing to ignore the fact that she could get pregnant, or an STD. For women who have become infected with an STD there is no day after pill that will prevent them from getting cervical cancer or painful warts or losing all ability to reproduce or in the case of AIDS dying (unless they know immediately that the person they slept with has AIDS). Therefore, if the woman chooses to have sex and does not want the baby, she should be happy that she will only have to suffer for nine months and then can give the child to someone else who really wants it.\n That is my pro-choice view. It is also called responsibility for the choices we have made.\n In the case of rape, I can only think of a friend of mine. She was raped at a very young age and became pregnant from it. She chose to keep the baby as a witness to others. Unfortunately, I have lost contact with her, but the last I knew she was a wonderful mother with a beautiful child.",
