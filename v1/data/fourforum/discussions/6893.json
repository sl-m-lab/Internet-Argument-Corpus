   "I just realized that if I were president and could get advice from any modern day president (say from FDR on), I would probably want the advice of Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton more than any of the others. Working back -- George W. doesn't cut it, neither does his Dad. Reagan wasn't the brightest bulb in the room and when he got caught with Iran Contra it was obvious that he really didn't have any idea what was happening. Jimmy Carter's over analyzing had him standing still when he should have been moving. I have to admit I have a soft spot in my heart for Gerald Ford. He was the most humble president. He knew he was over his head. He knew he needed some smart guys around him. If I was going to have a beer with any recent president it would be Ford. But Nixon... damn, the guy was brilliant. OK, so he was a bit paranoid. In foreign policy that can be a strength. And Clinton to... the guy is smarter than anyone around now. Do if I wanted advice, those would be the two ex-Presidents I would want to hear from. Amazingly, they are also the most disgraced. Maybe Washington just doesn't like guys who are too smart.",

   "It would depend on the issue I suppose, but in general, I'd have to take Clinton as well. And for the same reason as you. He is just simply the smartest president of modern times, although Kennedy is very close if not his equal in that department. I never really thought about Nixon in that way. Probably because I don't know a tremendous amount about him.\n \n I'll have to more thinking on a second choice.\n \n If I had to think of ideal president by mixing other presidents I'd do it this way:\n The intelligence of Clinton and Woodrow Wilson\n The charisma of Reagan and Clinton\n The integrity and straight-forwardness of Truman\n The vision of Kennedy",

I'm still proud of that vote. That was my first presidential election. My wartime president would probably be Ike. Nixon, smart as I think he was, would be too paranoid, Carter - forget about it -- to indecisive. I really think Reagan would be over his head. Bush 41 might not be that bad a consultant during wartime. Something tells me that Clinton (who by the way had the highest IQ of any modern President) would be a real good guy to have in your corner - but maybe not in your platoon. I don't think courage is his strong suit - but damn the guy is smart. That is why I like Ike... although he was a bit before my time so I never saw him in realtime action.",
