Michael V. Hayden, then head of the National Security Agency, emphasized how scrupulously the agency was protecting Americans from its electronic snooping. \n \n \"We are, I would offer, the most aggressive agency in the intelligence community when it comes to protecting U.S. privacy,\" General Hayden said. \"We just have to be that way.\"\n \n It was one of General Hayden's favorite themes in public speeches and interviews: the agency's mammoth eavesdropping network was directed at foreigners, not Americans. As a PowerPoint presentation posted on the agency's Web site puts it, for an American to be a target, \"Court Order Required in the United States.\"\n \n In fact, since 2002, authorized by a secret order from President Bush, the agency has intercepted the international phone calls and e-mail messages of hundreds, possibly thousands, of American citizens and others in the United States without obtaining court orders. The discrepancy between the public claims and the secret domestic eavesdropping disclosed last week have put the N.S.A., the nation's largest intelligence agency, and General Hayden, now principal deputy director of national intelligence, in an awkward position.\n \n While a few important members of Congress were informed of the special eavesdropping program, several lawmakers have said they and the public were misled.\n \n The episode could revive old fears that the secret agency is a sort of high-tech Big Brother. It was such fears - based on genuine abuses before the mid-1970's, hyperbolic press reports and movie myths - that General Hayden worked to counter as the agency's director from 1999 until last April.\n \n \"The image of N.S.A. has been muddied considerably by this revelation,\" said Matthew M. Aid, an intelligence historian who is writing a multiple-volume history of the agency. Mr. Aid said several agency employees he spoke with on Friday were disturbed to learn of the special program, which was known to only a small number of officials. \n \n \"All the N.S.A. people I've talked to think domestic surveillance is anathema,\" Mr. Aid said.\n \n An agency spokesman, Don Weber, declined to comment, saying, \"We don't discuss actual or alleged operational issues.\"\n \n At a news conference at the White House on Monday, General Hayden also emphasized that the program's operations had \"intense oversight\" by the agency's general counsel and inspector general as well as the Justice Department. He said decisions on targets were made by agency employees and required two people, including a shift supervisor, to sign off on them, recording \"what created the operational imperative.\"\n \n An intelligence official who was authorized to speak only on the condition of anonymity said, \"It's probably the most scrutinized program at the agency.\" The official emphasized that people whose communications were intercepted under the special program had to have a link to Al Qaeda or a related group, even if indirectly. The official also said that only their international communications could be intercepted. Other officials have said, however, that some purely domestic communications have been captured because of the technical difficulties of determining where a phone call or e-mail message originated. \n \n But many questions remain about the secret program, including some Mr. Aid said were raised pointedly by his contacts at the agency:\n \n \u00b6Did agency officials volunteer to perform the eavesdropping without warrants, or did the White House order it over agency objections?\n \n \u00b6Why was it not possible to use warrants, as the law appears to require, from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which granted 1,754 such warrants last year and did not deny a single application?\n \n \u00b6Or, if the court was considered too slow or cumbersome, why did the agency not ask Congress to adjust the law and legalize what it wanted to do?\n \n After all, officials who have been granted anonymity in describing the program because it is classified say the agency's recent domestic eavesdropping is focused on a limited group of people. Americans come to the program's attention only if they have received a call or e-mail message from a person overseas who is already suspected to be a member of certain terrorist groups or linked somehow to a member of such groups. And the agency still gets a warrant to intercept their calls or e-mail messages to other people in the United States.\n \n Had the agency openly sought the increased power in the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, \"I'm sure Congress would have approved,\" said Elizabeth Rindskopf Parker, a former general counsel of both the N.S.A. and the Central Intelligence Agency.\n \n By concealing the new program, she said, the N.S.A. breathed new life into the worst imaginings about itself. \"This makes it seem like the movies are right about N.S.A., and they're wrong,\" Ms. Parker said. . . .",
