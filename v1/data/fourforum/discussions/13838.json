   "January 27, 2010\n 4 Arrests in Phone Tampering at Landrieu Office\n .... Four people were arrested on Monday for allegedly posing as telephone technicians to enter the New Orleans offices of Senator Mary Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, and then tampering with her phone system.\n \n According to The New Orleans Times-Picayune, one of the men arrested was James O'Keefe, a filmmaker who produced videos purporting to document questionable practices at some field offices of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, known as Acorn. In the videos, Mr. O'Keefe and an associate, Hannah Giles, posing as a pimp and a prostitute, secretly filmed themselves seeking and receiving financial advice for a brothel from Acorn workers.\n \n .... The complaint detailed parts of the operation. Mr. Basel and Mr. Flanagan entered the building dressed in \"blue denim pants, blue work shirts, light green fluorescent vests, tool belts, and construction-style hard hats.\"\n \n Mr. O'Keefe was, at the time, already inside, according to the complaint, \"holding a cellular phone so as to record\" Mr. Basel and Mr. Flanagan. Mr. Dai was, along with the other three men, involved in the planning of the event.Senator Landrieu, one of the last Democratic holdouts in the Senate to vote for the health care bill, first negotiated an increase in Medicaid funds before she voted in favor of the legislation. \n\n 4 Arrested in Phone Tampering at Landrieu Office - NYTimes.com\n \n Right wing skullduggery exposed.\n \n And, about time.",

   "Utter nonsense, Archie. They were up to more skullduggery.\n \n By the way, one of the sleazebags, Robert Flanagan:\n \nFederal officials accused four men, including a conservative activist, of posing as telephone repairmen to tamper with phones at the New Orleans offices of Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu.\n \n The four men, who also included the son of an acting U.S. attorney, were arrested Monday in the Hale Boggs Federal Building in downtown New Orleans and charged with entering a federal building under false pretenses with the intent of committing a felony, according to the U.S. attorney's office for the Eastern District of Louisiana.\n \n One of the suspects, James O'Keefe, a 25-year-old filmmaker and conservative activist last year said his undercover videos at field offices of advocacy group Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, or Acorn documented corruption.\n \n .... The other men arrested were identified as Joseph Basel, 24, Stan Dai, 24, and Robert Flanagan, 24, of New Orleans. Mr. Flanagan is the son of William J. Flanagan, the interim U.S. attorney for the Western District of Louisiana. The suspects are scheduled to appear in federal court in New Orleans on Feb. 12.\n\n Four Charged in Alleged Phone Scam at Senator's Office - WSJ.com\n \n Flanagan is, undoubtedly, a George W. Bush appointee.",
