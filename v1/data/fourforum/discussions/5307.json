   "I know aboslutly nothing about beekeeping, though I have a couple of hives hanging on the back of my barn to pollinate cherry trees and flowers and such (VERY common around here). A guy from town comes and tends them and takes the honey out of them (I think). \n \n I lost one of the hives to the mite. It just started to die. the guy who cares for them killed all the bees, burned the hive, and sprayed some kind of chemical stuff all over the area where the hiive stood, then we burned all the vegetation back there. Don't know yet if the other colony has the mites or not yet. No signs so far....\n \n Apparently it is a very serious problem. I have noticed that the \"cherry crop\" (We only have a few cherry trees anyway) is suffering badly, and I can only guess it is because the bees are gone and they are not getting pollinated very well. \n \n I moved some peacocks out of the garden and have been feeding them back there, thinking that maybe they will eat the mites if any survived since I know they eat other kinds of mites. The jury is still out on whether that will work or not.
