   "I've been really interested in the Stacy Peterson case for the last week or so. What really stands out to me is that his 3rd wife died only a few years ago and her death was very suspicious. This is a man who marries very young women, much younger than him and seems to be extremely controlling. I believe he killed both Kathleen and Stacy. Did anybody see him on the Today Show this morning? Matt Lauer looked extremely uncomfortable at the very end of the interview, not looking at Peterson in the eye and generally with an upset look on his face. I believe Lauer thinks Peterson is guilty. What does everybody else think?\n \n http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21784901/",

He is guilty as hell in my opinion and never should have gotten away with a healthy and sober Kathleen allegedly drowning in her tub after warning everyone she knew that if she died, it was him who killed her. The fact is she had bruises and lacerations on her body but because he was a cop, the authorities ignored the obvious signs of a struggle. The Police Dept. should also be held culpable for Stacy's death because this murderer would have been convicted of his third wifes murder had they done their jobs objectively and professionally.",
