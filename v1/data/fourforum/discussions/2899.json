   "Why Iraq instead of pakistan? we don't feel like we need bases in pakistan. With Saudi Arabia expelling our troops, we wanted/needed another country in the ME to base our troops. The country needed to have a big enough infrastructure to support those troops, and we needed a place where we had the government in our pocket. Iraq seemed to fit the bill. They have the infrastructure to support our bases (before we blew it up that is) and they were no real threat, which made them easy to invade.\n \n Pakistan, on the other hand, has nukes and is a potentially dangerous adversary. We certainly don't want to go to war with a country that is not basically defenseless, they might hurt us. Thisis why N Korea is sitting on nukes still. we went to Iraq on the excuse of possible production of chemical and biological agents, and because saddam is unstable. N Korea on the other hand is led by a lunatic, and we know it, and they have nukes, and are most likely making more. N korea is actually a threat, Iraq was not.\n \n \n And we call the terrorists cowards.",

   "lol, even though the reality is saddening. we may just be creating another iran out of pakistan that will more than likely bite us in the *** in the future. do we ever learn?\n \n but really, how could we say we are taking out the taliban and not factor in the historical support of pakistan. even though pakistan is politically more stable and their military very effective, pakistanis are very much religious extremists known for their culture of bloodshed. ever heard of the sikhs?",
