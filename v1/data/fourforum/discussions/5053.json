I'm certainly going to write a response that is far different to a gay person than I am to a straight person, simply because that tells me what sorts of beliefs the person I'm talking to holds. I might say, \"Surely homosexuality makes you uncomfortable, but homosexuality is not harmful in any way shape or form, so forcing people to be heterosexual to get benefits is morally evil\" to a straight person who opposes same-sex marriage. If I'm talking about a gay person who opposes it (which isn't common, but it happens), I might say, \"Surely you do not wish to engage in same-sex marriage, and maybe even your religion disallows it, but other people do wish to be married and their religion does allow it. Your religion is not superior to theirs.\" The more one knows about his opponent, the better he can support his case.\n \n Normally I try not to reveal my sexual orientation immediately to avoid people saying that I only support same-sex marriage because I'm gay or I couldn't possibly know what a homosexual's intentions are because I'm straight. But everyone here already knows my orientation, and I don't think a newcomer to the board should be at a disadvantage.\n \n I am bisexual.",
