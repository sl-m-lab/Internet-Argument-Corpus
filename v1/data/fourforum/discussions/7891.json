   "Deutsche Welle reports that Belorusian opposition leader Aleksandr Milinkevich (who was heavily defeated by Lukashenko in a March 19 election) came on visit to Brussels to meet with EU foreign-policy chief Javier Solana. \n\n \n How the hell this stupid even dares to show up in Old Europe after he lost the election with that wide margin?! I think our officials gave him more than ample means to outadvertise Lukashenko and what? Why did you lose it, rascal? Where is the money, Milinkevich!? What did you spend it for? Oh, I know - this mongrel bough a country house, and a yacht, and a showy car. That's good! This was all worth it! Belorusian opposition is only a bunch of good-for-nothings avid of freeby! I think enough is enough. I think Milinkevich only deserves a bum's rush. Give 'em no more money, I tell you! Or he will go on milking us. We'd better wait till there are new leaders who could make trustworthy pols able to counter Lukashenko!",
