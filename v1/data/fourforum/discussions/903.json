Society today is a pure moral paradise by comparison.\n \n Abraham, Saul, Gideon, Reheboam and David were all married men who had mistresses and went unpunished. When King David had sex with Bathsheba, his punishment as decreed by God was that all his wives be publicly raped and his newborn infant would die. Abraham's wife, Hagar, and his child were tossed into the wilderness, merely because his other wife, Sarah, was jealous. Lot had sex with both his daughters, but the family was not punished. Both daughters were rewarded for sex with dad, with sons who founded nations.\n \n In our much-improved society today, gays and straights are open about sodomy and participate in a variety of activities. However, Hannaford would like us to discriminate against gays only. It is curious he remarks AIDS should scare people straight (sexuality is about fear?), when he also states AIDS is devastating Africa. That is where most of the cases are, and they come mostly from hetero sex. In Thunder Bay, there has not been one new case of gay-related AIDS in four years. This fact does not determine my sexual orientation.\n \n Clint Babula\n \n Thunder Bay, Ont.\n \n \u00a9 Copyright 2003 Calgary Herald",

It speaks volumes, given\n a) you're dealing with something trivial such as apple eating\n b) the person telling you about apple eating is already consigned a whacko\n c) you didn't think about eating apples (?) until someone pointed out how dangerous it was\n \n So, you've got an innocent act being made insidious - obviously the person is a whacko. You're stating the obvious. Apples are nice, there is no dispute.\n \n How about a different analogy.\n God is love. Out of love, He gives you the ultimate gift... free will. He will respect your decisions.\n In freedom of choice, there has to be a choice. If there's no choice, there's no freedom to choose. So, God says to you, \"I want you to obey Me, but it's up to you... but there are consequences (harm) if you disobey\"\n You are given a choice. You choose to disobey. And then you have the hide to complain when\n a) you get caught\n b) you are called to account for your actions.\n \n \n Just like, sometimes when the roads are clear, you might venture to drive on the other side of the road - just to see what it's like (I don't know if you've done this, but I have).\n You're a careful driver, you're taking a risk that's not 'harming' anyone. But, the police see you. You get caught. You have disobeyed and you face a fine. You say \"But no one was harmed\". But the harm was you disobeyed.\n \n That is what sin is. Sin is going against the Will of God.\n \n Personally, I don't think that homosexuality is the worse thing in the world, far from it... hence in the Bible, and Holy Tradition it is not given a lot of attention. Other specific things are given lots more 'air-time'.\n \n God, however made us for a purpose. That is, to be able to love Him. He has not made His laws unreasonable - such as asking us not to breathe.\n \n He has however asked us to forgo certain acts, some of them sexual.\n Forbidden 'sexual' things are\n sex outside Holy Union\n sex with minors, animals, and same sex situations.\n \n There is a vast scope of sexual pleasure within God's laws, but people will always be disobedient... and people are greedy and seek what they should not.\n \n You are a faddist, that is, your morals follow what is a 'fad'. Who knows, in thirty years time it might be acceptable to a lot of people to have sex with minors or animals, and people like yourself will probably be out there saying, \"Who are we to judge what other people do in private!\"\n \n You might scoff at this, but there is for instance a small group of people in Denmark who claim that sex with minors is 'beneficial' to a healthy upbringing - and they will cite 'medical evidence' to back this up.\n \n \n BUT, in the end you don't believe in God, so there's no argument really that would convince you.

Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals nor sodomites...\"\n \n As an Orthodox Christian I believe in Holy Tradition,* which is rather more than just what the Bible says. We believe that Tradition is the Bible as best understood.\n \n \"The Orthodox Christian Tradition on this matter is set forth in the Church's Scriptures, liturgical worship, canonical regulations, and the lives and teaching of the saints.

That is: \"The position of the Orthodox Church toward homosexuality has been expressed by synodical canons and Patristic pronouncements beginning with the very first centuries of Orthodox ecclesiastical life.\" In other words this pre-dates the composition of the Bible. (quoted from http://www.holy-trinity.org/morality/homosexuality.html). (Your argument would work better against a Protestant - it's actually remarkable how 'western-centric is the thinking of most free-thinkers).\n \n \nThen give me an example of where you feel it is against all sex in same-sex situations.\n\n \n See quote above. You claim that it is a mistranslation. My Church, which wrote the Bible in Greek, to begin with, and has been around 2,000 years, disagrees with you.\n \n \n Montalban:Simple rubbish. You've worked from an axiom that's non-Christian and then worked out from there.\n God does not put these thoughts into our heads. Free Will is our own, we choose to do these things or not.<<\n \n \nBased on the unproven assumption that God exists, you want me to trust you, and not someone of a different belief to define God and God's plans. \n\n \n No, here is your circular logic.

You can't use what you claim to be rubbish to back you up!\n \n \n \n Montalban:I'm saying that currently it is acceptable to many people that homosexuality is okay. Fifty years ago this was not the case. In thirty years time, who knows, maybe bestiality will be accepted by society.\n \n So, I'm trying to suggest that what might seem repugnant to you now, i.e. bestiality, may not be considered repugnant in the future. This is because societies morals seem to be faddish.<<\n \n \nWell, I don't think we will ever go back to the days when a woman could be married very young, and be one of many wives, barefoot and pregnant, tied to the stove. Much homophobia is based on a belief in gender roles. It is highly hypothetical whether or not we ever accept bestiality.\n\n \n I don't know why you bring this in. Whether we accept bestiality or not, well, 100 years ago homosexuality was no accepted. I see the gradual erosion of traditional values. Homosexuality just happens to be the fad at the moment. So, you're right I am just speculating about the further demise.\n \n \n Montalban:We Christians believe certain laws that are forever.\n \n \nBased on that unproven assumption that God exists again. Many other beliefs, certainly among Christians themselves, do not believe that homosexuality is outlawed forever, by the way they define God.\n\n \n Ah, no! It's unproven to you.

   "Excuse me, but the \"Orthodox Statement on Homosexuality\" is stunning ignorance. Homosexuality is not treated as a medical or psychological disorder, because it is neither of these things. The American Psychological Association, The American Medical Association, and the American Academy of Pediatrics, among others, all advocate acceptance of homosexuality. The only accepted treatment that occurs today, is treatment to help some gays and lesbians who have been taught to hate themselves, accept their homosexuality.\n \n There are no secretions associated with homosexuality that can be treated as a medical disorder, as the Orthodox Statement on Homosexuality claims. Give me a break! Homosexuality is not a moral failure as that document also claims. That is too much of a generalization.\n \n Why is it assumed that homosexuals would not be a part of God's creation? There are heterosexual couples who do not reproduce for a wide variety of realities they face in our industrialized society, or just by choice. We certainly don't reproduce anything like we used to, not in industrialized societies.\n \n I'm still going to get to those Bible verses.",

   "You are a faddist, that is, your morals follow what is a 'fad'.

You know nothing about how I base my judgements. My tradition is as old as yours- older in fact. You are the \"faddist\" with your cult, only a few hundred years old.\n \n \nYou might scoff at this, but there is for instance a small group of people in Denmark who claim that sex with minors is 'beneficial' to a healthy upbringing - and they will cite 'medical evidence' to back this up.\n\n \n Child molestors and their advocates are increasingly organized. Most of the larger organizing is happening as a backlash against survivors becoming more vocal since the 1980s (hence the \"False Memory Syndrome\" invention).\n \n \n\n BUT, in the end you don't believe in God, so there's no argument really that would convince you.

In my culture, homosexuality and all differences in gender and sexuality are not only acceptable, but make the persons special, closer to the divine.\n \n The fact that you are unable to see the difference between molesting children/animals and consensual sex of any kind is a demonstration of how completely messed up the arbitrary rules of your religion are. Just because they are both outlawed by your religion, you equate them. It's kind of disturbing.\n \n Thankfully, my tradition does not require unthinking obedience, and whether or not something is \"wrong\" is viewed in terms of how it will impact others. Something I doubt you would understand. Which explains why you feel the need to be so insulting about my beliefs. Or maybe you're just jealous?",

   "Indeed max, good point. Homosexuality has been around forever. The time when it was persecuted will probably prove to be a short anomily in the grand scheme of human history.\n \n Leviticus 18:22 & 20:13 \n \n You shall not lie with man as one lies with a women; this is an abomination.\n Leviticus 18:22 \n If a man also lie with mankind as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they should surely be put to death.\n Leviticus 20:13 \n \n As a gay man, I have never lieth with a woman, so I can say that I do not lie with mankind as I lieth with a woman. These verses could be telling a gay man not to treat his male partner as though he were a woman, to recognize one another's maleness. If the verse read you shall not lie with womankind as you lieth with a man, this would not apply to a straight man who has never lieth with a man. \n \n The Holiness Code of Leviticus was written essentially as a ritual manual for Israel's priests. Christians today are not bound by Leviticus. (Galatians 3:22-25). If they were, we would have to kill men for trimming the hair around their temples, which most men do. We would have to kill people for wearing clothing made of two blended textiles, such as cotton-polyester blends. \n \n \n The word abomination was translated from the Hebrew word toevah and means something found detestable by God because it is unclean. The term abomination is generally associated with idolatry and the Canaanite religious practice of cult prostitution. (Ezekiel) Because of toevah's strong association with cult prostitution it is unlikely that this passage applies to responsible gay relationships. \n \n \n Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural (physin) relations for unnatural (para physin) ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural (physin) relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another.\n Romans 1:26 \n The Greek words physin and paraphysin have been translated to mean natural and unnatural respectively. The word paraphysin does not mean \"to go against the laws of nature\", it implies action which is uncharacteristic for that person. An example of the word paraphysin is in Romans 11:24, where God acts in an uncharacteristic (paraphysin) way to accept the Gentiles. The verse seems to imply that it would be unnatural for heterosexuals to live as homosexuals, and for homosexuals to live as heterosexuals.",

Therefore we are in the best position to interpret what we wrote, not you. You of course can disagree with this. But even in non-traditional churches, such as the Lutheran, they have understood these verses to mean this... they may have changed their interpretation ... I don't know enough about them.\n \n \n \n \"Someone once told me that \"homosexuals are children of God, no more sinful than myself.\" This is an extremely misleading statement, although elements of it may be true. Whether anyone is more sinful than myself, a poor sinner, I cannot say, but I do know that a homosexual is an obedient child of God only if the above conditions are followed. A homosexual who makes excuses for this sin, and does not struggle against it (notice: I did not say that he must never fall) is estranged from God.\"\n\n \n \n \nDo you have any idea how hurtful, inhuman, and lonely such a life would be for a homosexual?\n\n \n Do you mean a homosexual who believes in God?\n \n \nThese then ARE two separate arguments you're trying to marry. One is Christians believe that homosexuality is wrong, based on the Bible (and for most Christians, Holy Tradition). You're happy to argue this, without knowing anything about Holy Tradition.\n\n \n \nI don't just accept your assumption that your tradition is correct, because it is yours, and because it is traditional. I am still looking for that proof in the text of the Bible, that says homosexuality is wrong.\n\n \n Then you ought to do some research on who put the Bible together.\n \n Take for example: Australia has a written Constitution. If you were to try to ascertain what type of government Australia has based solely on the Constitution then you'd be likely to assume that we are a military dictatorship - because all sorts of powers are vested in the by the hands of the Governor General (who is not subject to popular vote); including direction of the military. However, in practice we are more than just one document. We are a living country with laws, and people and institutions who interpret and live these laws. Many institutions in Australia exist solely by convention, rather than law. We have, for instance local governments, but these aren't under law recognised by the Commonwealth because the Constitution only recognises a Federal and State governments.\n \n You are trying to do the same with Christianity (and this is what Protestants do to.)\n \n The Orthodox Church was founded at Pentecost. It existed before the Bible. It put the Bible together. It based the Bible on Holy Tradition.\n \n Our Church has conventions - or Holy Tradition. Likewise, a law can't just sit in a book, it needs to be lived. You've been shown the text (the law) and how it's been interpreted for 2,000 years. You claim it makes no such claim. Based on what, your opinion?\n \n As we put the Bible together, as we live the life of the teachings of Christ I think we are the best people to determine/debate these things. For you to come along and say \"Prove it to me by this one document alone\" is too simplistic. The document does make a statement. If it were just that, you might be able to interpret it differently, to use one of your truisms, anything can be open to interpretation. But you'd be wrong to do so.\n \n \nI've no reason to prove to you that God exists in order to make a judgment about my own faith in regards to homosexuality. This is ludicrous! You're suggesting that before I make a moral decision that I need to prove to you the basis for that decision?\n\n \n \n \nOne can make a moral decision, regardless of one's belief or non-belief in God.\n\n \n Never said otherwise.\n \n \nI do not believe one can speak for God, and be so sure God is against homosexuality, or supporting homosexuality for that matter, without proving God's existence. At the very least, can someone show me text proof from the Bible? I'm guessing you'll say I won't believe it anyway. However, I am trying to understand the Christian motivation for repressing their homosexuals.\n\n \n You have been shown the texts in the Bible.\n \n \nIt is particularly cruel to make homosexuals feel guilty for their feelings, to hold them to a much stricter standard in terms of their actions compared to heterosexuals, when I just don't understand how you can be so sure. Asking Christian homosexuals to repress themselves like this is quite heavy. I believe it requires very demonstrable justification. Surely by Christian beliefs it would come from the Bible. As I've said, simply an appeal to tradition, I believe, is among the very weakest of arguments.\n\n \n \n Then you don't understand Holy Tradition.\n \n \nThank you for this respectful debate.\n\n \n No worries.",

This was not as unreasonable as it appears. His position flew in the face of common sense and 1,500 years of academics. It violated the accepted laws of physics. The star parallaxes demanded by this system could not be observed (and would not be until 1838). The Inquisition condemned the Copernican system and forbade Galileo from teaching it as fact.\"\n http://www.christianitytoday.com/history/newsletter/2001/jan05.html. It was the science of the day that said that the earth was at the centre of the solar system! It had been the scientific theory for thousands of years. But because you're quite happy to spout of anti-religious bigotry without actually researching it you've been shown up! Galileo was ordered NOT TO TEACH. He wasn't ordered what not to teach. He went against the ruling. He was found guilty of teaching when he'd been asked not to.\n \n Galileo's findings and publishing's were ironically un-scientific. He was told not to teach because he had not properly presented his case. The leading scientists of the day disagreed with him!\n \n He always remained a Catholic. Church things move incredibly slow. It was only late last century that the Catholic Church lifted an excommunication that had been laid down in the 1050s.\n \n \nTruisms aren't a debate.

How has the position on slavery and women changed?\n\n \n \n When did the Orthodox Church persecute Galileo? I am beginning to doubt your sincerity. Again you are going to try to falsify something based on what some people believe. It's like saying. The United States is a democracy. The United States had slavery. Slavery is wrong, therefore democracy is wrong.\n \n If you can find some fundamental teachings of the Orthodox Church that were in favour of slavery, then please present your evidence. So far in fact you've been arguing from lack of evidence. All you have done is spouted the same anti-religious bigotry that I've heard for years. I'm amazed you've not thrown in the Crusades!\n \n \nIndeed. So, what is right for you is faddish. I stated that Orthodoxy has always held to certain viewpoints re: homosexuality. We don't keep trying to 'modernise' in order to be hip.\n\n \n \nSo what was the position on the role of women and slavery in Orthodoxy? Has it changed officially through the leadership, or unofficially through the members?\n\n \n So now you're asking. You do the research. A moment a go you claimed you knew what the position was! You might want to look up how things become Orthodox doctrine. What is essential to Orthodoxy, and what isn't. If you actually did some research it would help you argue a bit better.\n \n \nTo you, yes it is obvious you don't believe. Not to billions of Christians\n\n \n \nGod is a cultural illusion, which may hold a great deal of power to those who hold this illusion. However, only our senses can determine what is real.\n\n \n Then you are again switching arguments. You can not see that you are doing this.You have the right to disagree with Orthodoxy - and you can try to argue that certain Orthodox teachings don't agree etc, but just to blankly then turn around and state - none of it is real, well as you said \"Well that settles it then, and sums up all of your arguments.\" That's all you have to do, is keep falling back to this statement... God is not real.\n \n \nTwo separate issues again. We believe that we are following God's Will.\n It is in Biblical texts. Orthodoxy believes that Tradition is the Bible as best understood.

The two biggest churches believe both in the Bible, and Holy Tradition. Both have condemned homosexuality based on this as sinful.\n \n But again you are trying to falsify something by what other people believe. The Catholic Church, and the Orthodox Church agree on the teachings of the earliest Church. Even the Anglican church says the Nicene Creed for example. The two biggest churches teach tradition.

It is simply the way a minority of our population expresses human love and sexuality. Study after study documents the mental health of gay men and lesbians. Studies of judgment, stability, reliability, and social and vocational adaptiveness all show that gay men and lesbians function every bit as well as heterosexuals. \n \n Nor is homosexuality a matter of individual choice. Research suggests that the homosexual orientation is in place very early in the life cycle, possibly even before birth. It is found in about ten percent of the population, a figure which is surprisingly constant across cultures, irrespective of the different moral values and standards of a particular culture. Contrary to what some imply, the incidence of homosexuality in a population does not appear to change with new moral codes or social mores. Research findings suggest that efforts to repair homosexuals are nothing more than social prejudice garbed in psychological accouterments.\n \n Many Christian denominations have changed their positions as society has changed on issues of morality, ordination of women, slavery, homosexuality, science. One cannot judge which movements are merely fads, and which will be here to stay. If acceptance of homosexuality is possibly a fad, acceptance of Judaism and Christianity, or opposition to slavery could just as easily be fads.

Science, or scientific facts can be used to show a number of proofs, depending upon your own personal bias. \n You've seen the ads, \"Buy BRAND X Fat Controller - Results Guaranteed\" by laboratory testing, of course. \n There is of course a more insidious use of science. In the early 1970s a group of radical feminists went so far as you science to suggest that it was physically impossible for a woman to achieve sexual orgasm whilst having penetrative sex. Even if the woman experienced an orgasm, she was said to be deceiving her self.... \"That even in a woman's sexuality, there is deceit on the part of men, and complacency on the part of some women\" in Koedt, A. \"The Myth of Vaginal Orgasm.\" \n in Koedt, A. & Levine, E. & Rapone, A., (eds.).

These last two cases are of course not the norm, but they indicate the wide-range of ideas that can be routinized by the judicious quoting of scientific authority. \n If there are many people reading this that already believe in evolution, or for that matter, believe in biblical creationism, then it is important to keep in mind that the people appealing to science have biases at work, regardless of how objectively rationalistic they present themselves. \n It is wrong to believe that because someone believes in the Bible that they are less rational than someone who is an atheist. \n Do atheists have an agenda? That is a question you can ask yourselves- what is it that atheists are trying to persuade you to? \n \n *See also \n Kearnon, P. Man-Hating. \n in Koedt, A. & Levine, E. & Rapone, A., (eds.). (1973). Radical Feminism. Quadrangle Books, New York.\n \n Thus, these militant lesbians wanted to convince women that it was physically impossible for a woman to achieve orgasm from penetrative sex. They used science to back up their political agenda of man-hating.\n \n You have many people who are homosexual who are willing to find scientific evidence to show you that what they do is normal.

Homosexual promiscuity fuels the AIDS crisis in the West, but even that tragedy it is not allowed to interfere with sexual freedom.<<\n \n How many is \"many men\"? These men may react differently if they did not feel they were treated as \"outlaws\". There are many gay men and straight men who do accept society's moral values such as fidelity, and who do conform to society's moral values which are against promiscuity.\n \n Homosexual promiscuity fuels the AIDS crisis in the West? Promiscuity is just one aspect which adds to sexual risk. It is risky behaviour such as unprotected sex and shared needles which is the main cause. The larger AIDS crisis in Africa occurs mainly from risky sex between heterosexuals.",

   "Also from the link posted by Montal a few replies ago...\n \n A second problem with psychoanalytic studies is that they have only examined homosexuals who were already under psychiatric care - in other words, homosexuals who were seeking treatment or therapy. Patients, however, are probably not representative of well-adjusted individuals in the general population. Just as it would be inappropriate to draw conclusions about all heterosexuals based only on data from heterosexual psychiatric patients, we cannot generalize from observations of homosexual patients to the entire population of gay men and lesbians. \n \n \n The weight of evidence In a review of published studies comparing homosexual and heterosexual samples on psychological tests, Gonsiorek (1982) found that, although some differences have been observed in test results between homosexuals and heterosexuals, both groups consistently score within the normal range. Gonsiorek concluded that \"Homosexuality in and of itself is unrelated to psychological disturbance or maladjustment. Homosexuals as a group are not more psychologically disturbed on account of their homosexuality\" (Gonsiorek, 1982, p. 74; see also reviews by Gonsiorek, 1991; Hart, Roback, Tittler, Weitz, Walston & McKee, 1978; Reiss, 1980). \n Confronted with overwhelming empirical evidence and changing cultural views of homosexuality, psychiatrists and psychologists have radically altered their views during the last two decades. \n \n \n Removal from the DSM In 1973, the weight of empirical data, coupled by changing social norms and the development of a politically active gay community in the United States, led the Board of Directors of the American Psychiatric Association to remove homosexuality from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). Their decision was supported in 1974 by a vote of the membership",

If you're basing your beliefs on writings from the year 500, and these writings give important and explicit instructions for how to live, how can you say your tradition existed prior to these writings?\n\n \n Holy Tradition is both changing and non-changing. Just like you are you, and all the time you have been alive you have been you, but you as a child and you as you are now, are hopefully different.\n \n As you grow, you've learnt more about the world, and different situations have emerged that you've never experienced before. You have the teachings of your parents and those who went before you, but you are unique, so you need to work things out.\n \n In a similar fashion, Jesus gave his teachings to the Church, but at the same time he gave them commission to do things in His name. Issues such as abortion and homosexuality have been taught by the church; teachings that are long-standing. I am not sure that an issue of internet pornography is long-standing but the Church would be able to reference to earlier, similar situations; thus there is change and non-change.\n \n The Divine Liturgy that we follow dates from the 300s. This implies two things; a) it is essentially the same for 1700 years and b) that there was a different form of worship for the first 300 (or so) years; this happened because different needs arose.\n \n I have shown the many writers of Orthodoxy who have commented on homosexuality. If you can find that these have changed their view - then you'd be able to say 'tradition has changed'.\n \n Further, God is essentially unknowable. But at the same time He has provided mechanisms for us to catch glimpses. Over the 2,000 years many Orthodox have pondered various issues. Some have written about these things. Sometimes they disagree slightly and sometimes a lot. The writings and issues themselves must be worked out, as to which are Orthodox and which are not.\n \n There are some issues in Orthodoxy that are un-Orthodox. In Australia, and in the USA you will find Russian, Serbian, Greek, Antiochian etc Orthodox Churches. It is not the tradition of the Church to organise itself in such manner, and although this issue has been around 200 years or so, is still not rectified - there should in fact be a single Australian Orthodox Church, and a single American Orthodox Church. However, the administrative issues of the Church which I've exampled are not to do with doctrine.\n \n Perhaps this will only muddy the issue more: you could in fact say that some things are at the core of Orthodoxy, and some are not (where the division is, is itself a matter of discussion).\n What I would see as a core issue - Jesus is the Son of God, or that Jesus died and rose again on the third day.\n A non-core issue - whether we can sit during the Divine Liturgy, or if the priest should have a really long beard.\n \n \nIn other words, if these writings are immutable, than how can you say your tradition existed before the writings did? \n\n \n I do not understand this question. I can tell you though that Orthodox means holding onto traditions.\n \n \nHow about I accept Orthodox people, as long as they don't practice Orthodoxy?\n\n \n That is of course up to you. If you think that practicing Orthodoxy is essentially wrong. We believe certain behaviours are wrong; murder is one of them. If you want to accept someone who has murderous tendencies but who doesn't murder then you would have a better analogy.\n \n \nSo you believe harm is good? Oppression is good? Balance is bad?\n Caring for each other, all creatures, and the earth our home is messed-up and arbitrary?\n\n \n No, you believe harm is good. You believe a lot of issues of self-harm; masturbation, homosexuality etc are okay because you\n a) can't see any obvious harm\n b) hear from people that these things are fun therefore they must be okay.\n \n \n \nIndeed, your traditions allow you to ignore them, so it seems... especially if you're saying you don't need to obey them.\n\n \n \nPlease explain what you mean by this.\n\n \n Well, you think that I am compelled to obey my traditions, therefore this is bad. Obviously you are not compelled to obey yours. Therefore you can ignore them, if it cramps your style. I believe you are saying that you don't need to obey them, this would, in my understanding, make them optional.\n \n \nGood. So, what do you do if you disagree with the Holy canon? Ignore it? Disobey? What if the church finds out?\n\n \n You need to weigh up things if you are to disagree. If a thousand doctors tell people that smoking is bad, they are not compelled to obey the doctors, but they'd be fools not to weigh up the evidence. In a similar aspect, we Orthodox are supposed to humble ourselves and realise that there are other people who know more than we do. I know Catholics use the term 'Doctor of the Church' for some of the great theologians - I'm unsure if it's an Orthodox term. I as you can tell, am not very good at being humble - I am probably the worst example of an Orthodox for you to be debating with.\n \n What if the Church finds out? I do not know. I am not an expert in this. I have never even thought to look this one up.\n \n You could well ask, 'what if the Church does not know about it?' Ultimately God knows all.\n \n \nYep. My tradition is not just any tradition. It actually makes sense for the world, no matter what the time period, encourages love and peace, encourages diversity and understanding, and community strength.\n\n \n Yes, traditions and Holy Tradition are different things. It confuses a lot of people with some similar terms. For instance we say \"We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic church\" but catholic and Catholic are different. (Anglicans say the same thing and understand the differences too).\n \n I do believe though, on reflection that the title of this post has been baldy put.\n \n All peoples have morals. So for you and I it may be an issue of morality, but for you it is not morally wrong, but for me it is. I can but state why we believe it so. And so, should have perhaps said \"This is what we believe...\" rather than \"This is...\" (although in effect we believe both to be the same, but one is less confrontational than the other).",

   "'d like to say that 'unprotected sex' or rather 'protected sex' is a poor modern misnomer.(...)\n \n However abstinence or faithful monogamy are the ultimate protection.\n\n \n As for whether any sex is \"protected\", most people who are knowledgeable on the subject talk about 'safer sex'.\n \n Faithful monogamy won't help you if your partner acquired their STI before you became a couple. It is also just as likely to lower the risks of trading infections for XXXXX people as it is for straights.\n \n After all, you only need one infected partner to acquire an STI. It doesn't necessarily come form promiscuity.\n \n \nIn a similar fashion, Jesus gave his teachings to the Church, but at the same time he gave them commission to do things in His name. Issues such as abortion and homosexuality have been taught by the church; teachings that are long-standing. \n\n \n Indeed, because Jesus isn't quoted as saying anything about abortion or homosexuality. Neither in fact to I recall any reference to abortion in the Old or New Testament- correct me if I'm wrong.

Basically you responded that you are going on faith.\n \n \nIf you want to accept someone who has murderous tendencies but who doesn't murder then you would have a better analogy.\n\n \n Well, I happen to believe Orthodoxy causes more damage than homosexuality, so there you are. Still, the problem with your murderer analogy is that murderers a) have victims, and families of victims, very real consequences for the fact that they have taken someone's life, and b) generally don't consider \"murderer\" as part of their identity, part of who they are as a person, the way a religious belief or culture is a part of a person. I'm sure you can find exceptions, but in general, queerness is, not unlike church membership or cultural affinity, a way to get to know people, a way to form a small community in a large urban area, a social and cultural nexus, with mores and in-group language, etc. Murder doesn't tend to be like that. I actually find it horrifying that you think murdering someone and having consensual sex with someone are morally equivalent to any degree. By the way. It's kind of creepy.\n \n Anyway, asking someone to just not act homosexual is asking them not to be themselves, and love who they love, because you think it's a bad thing to do. It's no wonder people aren't crowding to get into aversion-therapy or \"conversion\" programs the way they are lining up to get onto the dance floor.\n \n \nNo, you believe harm is good. You believe a lot of issues of self-harm; masturbation, homosexuality etc are okay because you\n a) can't see any obvious harm\n b) hear from people that these things are fun therefore they must be okay.\n\n \n Wrong again, montalban. \n \n a) My tradition holds that many things in society at present are harmful, but the act of consensual pleasure or self-pleasure in any way, massage, sex, reading to each other, singing, masturbating, or whatever, are not only not harmful, they are divine.\n \n b) I don't simply believe this because a guy in a black dress or a book told me. I've actually experienced both, masterbation and homosexuality that is, and have found it to be true for myself that these acts do me no harm whatsoever. They only do good, in and of themselves. They are a form of worship, and should be respected for their sacredness.\n \n What you say is like asserting that licking your fingers is bad for you. You have no actual evidence that it does any harm, but you heard it does, so you believe it. It must make it hard for you to deal with all the times you've petted your own metaphoric pet snake. It's a dumb waste of energy and time to feel guilty about things which aren't harmful and feel good.",

Basically you responded that you are going on faith.\n\n \n The writings haven't changed. The writings are from Man as inspired by the Holy Spirit. This is a small distinction to be made - for instance Islam believes that their prophet basically took dictation, word for word, from an Angel. We do not believe this to be so with Orthodoxy - I doubt you'll find many Christians disagreeing on this point.\n \n The Orthodox Church follows Holy Tradition, and this is the Scripture as rightly understood. Not everything that Jesus taught was written down \n \"And there are also many other things that Jesus did, which if they were written one by one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written. Amen\" John 21:25\n \n When you were taught by your parents - did you keep records of all that they taught? What if 40 years later you decided to write down what they taught. You'd probably close to the mark on certain critical events, and you'd be close to the over-all themes that they taught.\n \n What we have with the Bible is four separate accounts, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.

But the difference between you and them is that they had the Holy Spirit guiding them.\n \n As time progressed the corpus of works grew and grew.

I wasn't reading it looking for things to condemn people about.\n \n\n \n With regard to abortion...\n \n What about \"Thou shall not kill\"? However, you keep wanting to base your argument solely on the Bible - if you want to do this you should actually pick-out one of the number of Protestants on this forum, otherwise you aren't paying any respect to the teachings of my faith - it is like basing your critique of Hinduism based solely on the Bhagdad Gita, and ignoring the other books and commentaries that faith has produced. (not that you need to respect Orthodoxy, but it's a bit like judging the beauty of the Mona Lisa by looking only at the signature of Leonardo da Vinci... one small but important part... and like the signature, you can't really separate the elements of Orthodoxy. We are a holistic religion. In our services we satisfy all of the senses;\n sight - icons and other sacred\n ears - chants and responses\n olfactory - incense\n feeling - touching the icons, shaking hands with brethren, etc.\n taste - Holy Communion\n \n Protestants will take some or all of these away. We would be appalled to do so. Anyway, I digress.\n \n \n Part of Holy Tradition is the Bible, but also the teachings of the Holy Fathers... some of whom wrote before we put the Bible together.\n \"In the Orthodox Church calendar there are three occasions in which the Church commemorate three important persons in the womb. This happens in the celebration of The Annunciation, in the feast of the conception of the Theotokos (Mary), by Saint Anne, and the celebration of the conception of Saint John the Baptist by Saint Elizabeth Schaeffer, F, \"Dancing Alone: The Quest for Orthodox Faith in the Age of False Religion\", pp243-4\n The significance of Mary's visitation to her cousin, when the unborn St. John the Baptist leapt for joy means that we understand that personality, and life exist before birth.\n Isaiah 49.15 \"Can a woman forget her nursing child, and not have compassion on the son of her womb?\"\n \"In the light of Holy Tradition the wilful abortion of a bay by its mother is as unnatural a practice as can be imagined.\" (Ibid, p244)\n \"There are two ways of instruction, as there are two powers, that of light and that of darkness. And there is a great difference between the two ways. One is controlled by God's light-bearing angels, the other by the angels of Satan. And as the latter is the ruler of the present era of lawlessness, so the former is lauded from eternity to eternity. Among the precepts of the way of light is this; do not murder a child by abortion, or commit infanticide.\" From the Epistle of Barbanas (c.138) as quoted in Ibid, p235\n \"How, then is a living being conceived? Is the substance of both body and soul formed together at the same time, or does one of them precede the other? We do indeed maintain that both are conceived, formed and perfected at the same time, as they are born together; nor is there any moment intervening in their conception, which would give prior place to either. Consider the first events in the light of the last. If death is defined as nothing other than the separation of the body and soul, then life, the opposite of death, should be defined as nothing else but the union of body and soul... We acknowledge, therefore, that life begins with conception, because we content that the soul begins with conception.\" Quoted from Tertullian (208), in Ibid, p237.",

   "[QUOTE=Gader'el]God gave us many laws which us humans always disobey. Why does he make these laws that are so far out of our reach? Why create a Homosexual just to send them to Hell?\n \n Your argument is confused. Where does it say that God creates people just to send them to hell? Perhaps in Calvinism this is the case, but I'm not a Calvinist, I'm an Orthodox, so I'm not going to argue what another faith believes. All I can say is, show me where in Orthodoxy do we say that God creates people just to send them to Hell!\n \n If you can't, then you're very confused about what you should be arguing with whom!\n \n Anyway, are you saying that God created homosexuals? Or are you asking if God created homosexuality?\n \n [QUOTE=Gader'el]At the end of the day Religion is just an excuse to persecute specific people. Be them the women who want Abortions. Be them Gays. Be them Transsexuals, Transvestites or Transgender. Religious wars have been going on since Cain and Abel and they do nothing but hinder. Religion may be a joyful way of coping with grief, but why not take up a decent Religion? Satanism for one is one of the very few which encourages people to do what will make them happy, so long as they accept the consequences afterwards (if their choice is bad).\n \n Oh dear! So full of loaded statements. A 'decent' religion is what? How could it be 'decent' if you've already said that religion is in the end just an excuse to persecute specific people? You're still confused about what you're arguing. Are you anti-religious, period?\n \n Wars have been going on since the beginning of man. Atheistic states such as Communist China, North Korea etc have continued to persecute people, and religious people too - ever heard of Tibet?\n \n \nIf i was for the whole peace dealio i would ask \"Why can't we all just get along\" but i thrive on conflict...so i won't.\n\n \n Indeed, why can't we just get along? Man is full of pride. Show me the perfect atheist society that has over-come man's flawed nature. You can't, but you won't even try because it's not people at fault, it's religion!\n \n However, some people break rules. I could just ignore that, but I can't in good conscience. I must speak out. Homosexuals are breaking God's rules. If you don't believe in God, then I can't argue with you about God's rules, because you don't believe in the source.\n \n What did Jesus say to lead you to believe that He wasn't for peace?",

I never claimed that the Orthodox Christians used the bible as their strongest resource, I said \"a number of Christians.\" I never specified any one group, and I never implied that I meant all Christians. You seem to constantly bring up your Orthodox Christianity even when it may have no meaning to what a person has said.\n \n I understand that your beliefs has its \"Holy Tradition\" and it does not go by the bible alone. I also under that you interpret the bible in a number of different ways. Some of it you interpret as symbolism. Some you interpret as actual historic references. Some you interpret in different manners. By my post, I merely meant to point out--to those Christians who vocalize the bible as the \"ultimate law/truth\" that one should never break--that a few of the laws the claim to uphold appear rather absurd, even foolish in this day.

Do you hate them now? Do you think they were wrong to give you a framework of rules to live by?\n\n Many of the things my parents have taught me actually serve a purpose to my life. They did not tell me to kill my brother if he works on the sabbath day. They did not tell me to kill my sister if she wore pants made from two different types of fabric. They did not tell me that if I had a daughter I could sell her into slavery, and have them feel OK with it--even seeming to condone it.\n \n My mother has told me many times not to play with fire. But she has done so in order to teach me safety. She does not mean to disallow me from ever using fire if I feel the need. But, rather, as guide to help keep me safe in my decision making.\n \n \nDisobeying God's laws is disobedience, regardless of the law.\n\n So, in order not to disobey God's laws, you would support me selling my daughter into slavery? You would support me stoning a person for the various reasons I have listed before? According to God's law, I have a responsibility to do such things.\n \n I doubt that you probably would support me in such a case. Because to you the bible does not act as the \"ultimate truth\" but rather a guide to shape the traditions to which your Othodoxy adheres.

I did not mean the Orthodox Church.\n \n <<If you can find some fundamental teachings of the Orthodox Church that were in favour of slavery, then please present your evidence.<<\n \n Again, I perhaps should have been more specific.\n \n <<I stated that Orthodoxy has always held to certain viewpoints re: homosexuality. We don't keep trying to 'modernise' in order to be hip.\n \n So now you're asking. You do the research. A moment a go you claimed you knew what the position was! You might want to look up how things become Orthodox doctrine. What is essential to Orthodoxy, and what isn't. If you actually did some research it would help you argue a bit better.<<\n \n I don't think I claimed I knew what the position was. I was just curious as to how static Orthodoxy was, if it did any changing like the rest of society. You are correct, I should do my own research.",

   "Because the Bible is the ultimate truth,\n\n \n \n What a ridiculous and ignorant statement\n \n The bible is a book, just a book, actually it is a compilation of badly written books that contradict themselves and each other\n And in terms of world religions and scriptures- fairly new fangled\n \n The funniest thing about bible believers is they claim that the authors were \"divinely inspired\" by god\n Basically, that the author was inspired by the character he created\n \n If you want to base your morals on this book- go ahead\n no one can stop you\n But if you want to base a law on that misguided judgement\n sorry pal\n that's in direct contravention of the constitution which is the basis for government- not your silly book",
