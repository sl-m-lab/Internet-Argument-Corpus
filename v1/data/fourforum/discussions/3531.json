   "Just when you thought the story about George W. Bush's Air National Guard service was bad enough, wait until you hear about CBS's recent blunders. It certainly didn't stop there.\n \n After basing a major national headline story on fake documents, running the story anyway without checking the sources, claiming the documents were not fake, and then acknowledging that they were fake but continuing to assert the substance was true, CBS continued on its path to horrible reporting. \n \n Just a week after the drama over Bush's military service subsided, CBS aired a story alleging that Bush was going to reinstate a draft. Their sources...a chain email stating that Bush had plans to issue a bill to reinstate the draft. The person they interviewed and did their story on they claimed to be a concerned mom who was fearful of her son going to war. Did they check this out before hand? Of course not, CBS doesn't do that. They ran the story anyway. Turns out that she is the head of an anti-war group and an anti-draft activist (which they never said). What is also interesting is that the bill they were voting on was issued by 2 Democrats (which was also never said in the story).\n \n Think that's all? Nope. Yesterday they aired a story, along with the New York Times, alleging that the Bush administration failed to guard a stockpile of 380 tons of explosives in Iraq, and that under their watch they were stolen. An article on the NRO said that it would take 40 18 wheelers to move those explosives. Wouldn't that prompt most people to verify all information before reporting? Not CBS. They aired it anyways, along with the NY Times, and today reports are out that the explosives were missing before US troops even arrived in Iraq. Did CBS or the NY Times point out their error in their articles today? Nope.\n \n What was Dan Rather doing while these stories were being reported?\n \n I would have thought that CBS learned its lesson the first time, and maybe even the second time. But as the old overused cliche says, \"Third time's a charm.\" Maybe 3 complications such as these will prompt CBS to make some changes and hire people who actually know how to report news.",

That way, there would be little or no time for Bush and his supporters to do anything about it. \n \n Can CBS please get out of John Kerry's butt and report the news honestly?",
