   "The question has been around for a while. A couple of years ago karl crawford (known on the web by several handles) answered that the plutonium fissioned away. No matter how deep and well documented the explanations, he always resorted to the idea that \"stray\" neutrons \"knocked off\" the plutonium. He never specified the source of the \"stray\" neutrons or how they could cause plutonium to fission without causing the formation of more plutonium from 238-U. Other than that the creationist answer has been that \"God created the fossil reactors\" or that the plutonium was carried away by the aquifer.",

   "I'd like to know how a fission reaction was supposedly possible in the first place. This would be hard to achieve using only light water and (today's) natural uranium (at about 0.7% U-235).\n\n Well, since the composition of the uranium body when it was a natural reactor wasn't the same as today's natural uranium, it doesn't matter. What is important was the composition of the ore back then. Since U-238 has a half-life of 4.468E+9 years and U-235 has a half-life of 7.038E+8 years, it is apparent that the U-235 decays much more rapidly. It stands to reason that the The relative percentage of U-235 to U-238 was higher in the past. It also stands to reason that thee was more uranimum present at the time that the natural reactors were active. About 2 billion years ago the U-235 was about 3% or more of the composition of the uranium.\n \nAs seen on age 81 of \"The Elements of Nuclear Power\" (3ed) (Bennet & Thomson, Longman Scientific & Technical, ISBN 0-582-02224-X) using only those materials it is impossible to make a homogeneous reactor regardless of size.\n\n Not sure what that means. Using only what material? Natural uranium ore? Today, the uranium is enriched so that U-235 is averages about 3% of the uranium. Since the ratio of the U-235 has been declining relative to the total uranium (today about .7%), it used to be more in the past. Given a high enough concentration and a suitable moderator and you get a nuclear reactor.\n \nOld-earth advocates say that the reactors were active when ancient natural Uranium contained more U-235 than today. Is there an alternative view ?\n\n No. Not from anyone informed in the field. There actually isn't any other hypothesis that adequately explains what was found. There is no question that there was a nuclear reaction at some time in the past. There hasn't been enough time for the radioactive products of that reaction to decay in 6 to 10,000 years. The amount of U-235 wouldn't have been great enough to sustain a reaction 6 to 10,000 years ago. The reactors were active around 2 billion (2.00E+9) years.\n \n I see that I failed to give a link to a site with some information on Oklo.\n Natural Fossil Fission Reactors\n \n From the above site:\n \nUsing a number of radioactive clocks the Oklo fossil reactors have been radioactively dated to be about 2000 million years old. The uranium in these reactors is thought to have come from the tiny amounts of uranium orginally scattered throughout the earth's crustal rocks during its formation.\n\n \n Isn't it interesting that Heidi hasn't informed us how the creationist web sites have handled the question?",
