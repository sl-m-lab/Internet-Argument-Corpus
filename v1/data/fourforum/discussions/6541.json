And oh yes, Jesus did speak of judgement more than love. \n \n Howard. I stated before that Jesus spoke on sin, repentence and judgement more than love and acceptance. Here are but a few verses to back that:\n Matthew 9:12, 11:21-24, 12:39-45, all of 23; Mark 9:42-48, 10:5; Luke13:1-5 &34-35, 17:1-4; John 8:11 That is but a small taste of the truth.

Jesus message was one of Love and Forgiveness. If you could embrace that understanding, then there is world beyond your wildest dreams that awaits you. \"This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.\"  (Jn:15:12). Notice the words Jesus uses. \"This is my commandment...\" He sums it up for us in one sentence.\n \n Bassman, Jesus proclaimed no commandments about judgment or sin or repentance. He states his commandments over and over and over and they are about love. You will not find one commandment from Jesus saying you should punish someone or you should judge someone. He uses those words in parables and stories, but the only commandments he issues are ones that we should love. Love our God, Love our neighbors, Love one another, Love our enemies. The pain and anguish you exist in is because you miss the mark (that is what sin is, to miss the mark) you do not keep the simple commandments of love that Jesus passed on to us.",

   "Sigh. And I suspect that Katrina hit the bible belt because they were worshipping the wrong god too?? \n \n Natural disasters happen. It does not matter the religion of the victims. Even\n the bible acknowledes that the 'Rain falls on the just and the unjust alike'.\n\n \n For once I agree with you. Good statement. That's not to say that God doesn't allow it to happen (who knows why), but I agree that natural disasters happen and they are indiscriminate. We have no business trying to ascertain a divine purpose against any group of people or individuals.\n \n Although I don't think Poohbear was trying to blame anyone. I think he or she was just providing the explanation based on \"the Fall\" theology.",

   "youve got a good point. God isnt to blame for these disasters we, the human race are responsible.. you see back in Genesis when Adam and Eve sinned they brought creation with them. meaning when they were in the garden they didnt have to work squat! but when they sinned and got kicked out they suddenly had to work! so when we sin nature serves up the consequences.. the tsunami.. where did it hit? in a muslim, islamic etc.. naiton.. GOd s these religions because they are WRONG! so when they are worshipping other \"gods\" and not worshipping God.. the one True God.. its sinning and so nature serves up its consequences.. its one viscious cycle.. that wouldnt be here if we onnly werent so stubborn and prideful.. and would stop beliving in allah and buddha.. and all thoses other fake pieces of trash!\n\n poohbear, you are saying exactly what i said the typical religious logician would say. your justification for natural disasters that kill thousands of people is that god is communicating to mankind that he is not pleased with man's behavior. whatever the behavior is, the typical christian can easily pinpoint it, or if not, just that \"god knows why\".\n \n your god seems to enjoy bringing punishment to the earths inhabitants a lot, since god's blessing never arrive with such fanfare. whats even more stupid about this argument is that many of the victims of the hurricane were christians. the rain falls on the just and the unjust, according to the bible, so what makes you think that this was a punishment to the unjust for their injustice, when the just perish right along with them?\n \n interstingly enough, the states that were hit by the hurricane are right in the heart of what is known as the \"bible belt\", the region that christians consider most religious, and the region that christians credit for the prosperity of the nation, and its protection from peril. so how do you suppose god would effectively send a message to the nation to seek him, when his message of punishment falls right smack in the middle of the region that is known to be most religious?\n \n we often focus on new orleans and its destruction, saying that god is punishing them because of their revelous mardi gras celebrations. interestingly enough, about half of the mardi gras revelers are out-of-state visitors, and not only that, but the surrounding states and cities that have nothing to do with the mardi gras were also demolished. so hows that for a message?",
