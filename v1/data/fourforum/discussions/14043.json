   "From a right wing blogger no less:\n \nMarch 18, 2010, - 5:46 am\n Sean Hannity's Freedom CONcert Scam: Almost None of Charity's $ Went to Injured Troops, Kids of Fallen Troops; G5s for Vannity?\n By Debbie Schlussel\n For the last several years, Sean Hannity and the Freedom Alliance \"charity\" have conducted \"Freedom Concerts\" across America. They've told you that they are raising money to pay for the college tuition of the children of fallen soldiers and to pay severely wounded war vets. And on Friday Night, Hannity will be honored with an award for this \"Outstanding Community Service by a Radio Talk Show Host\" at Talkers Magazine's convention.\n \n But it's all a huge scam.\n \n \nIn fact, less than 20%-and in two recent years, less than 7% and 4%, respectively-of the money raised by Freedom Alliance went to these causes, while millions of dollars went to expenses, including consultants and apparently to ferry the Hannity posse of family and friends in high style.\n And, despite Hannity's statements to the contrary on his nationally syndicated radio show, few of the children of fallen soldiers got more than $1,000-$2,000, with apparently none getting more than $6,000, while Freedom Alliance appears to have spent tens of thousands of dollars for private planes. Moreover, despite written assurances to donors that all money raised would go directly to scholarships for kids of the fallen heroes and not to expenses, has begun charging expenses of nearly $500,000 to give out just over $800,000 in scholarships.\n\n Sean Hannity's Freedom CONcert Scam: Almost None of Charity's $ Went to Injured Troops, Kids of Fallen Troops; G5s for Vannity?\n \n Geesh! Doesn't the Man of Greed have enough millions of bucks already?",

Doesn't the Man of Greed have enough millions of bucks already?\n\n \n From your own weblink:\n \n \"Debbie Schlussel alleges that only $1 million of the organization&#8217;s $8.8 million in revenue was going to soldiers and scholarships in 2008. This figure is the product of a misleading and selective reading of the organization&#8217;s tax forms.\n \n The numbers that Schlussel cite refer to direct financial transfers to individuals &#8211; that is, if there is a direct grant that Freedom Alliance gives to a soldier. This does not include all the positive work that doesn&#8217;t involve a direct grant.\n \n Freedom Alliance also spends money on non-cash benefits for military families, involving things like taking soldiers to sporting events and sending care packages to troops&#8217; [in short, there seems to be reasonable evidence to contract or at least raise reasonable questions against the \"scam\" accusation]\"\n \n If you're looking for real liars, look to Pelosi, Obama, and Reid.",

   "A \"reasonable\" charity spends 25% or less on administration. Hannity falls far short of that undemanding standard.\n \n From the article:\n \n \" ...... According to its 2006 tax returns, Freedom Alliance reported revenue of $10, 822, 785, but only $397,900-or a beyond-measly 3.68%-of that was given to the children of fallen troops as scholarships or as aid to severely injured soldiers.\n \n On the other hand, 62% of the money went to \"expenses,\" including $979,485 for \"consultants\" and an \"advisor.\" Yes, consultant/advisors got more than double what injured troops and the kids of fallen troops got. The tax forms show that \"New World Aviation\" got paid $60,601 for \"air travel.\" Was that for Hannity's G5? Like I said, neither the charity nor Hannity is talking. And finally, that year, Freedom Alliance spent $1,730,816 on postage and shipping and $1,414,215 on printing, for a total of $3,145,031, nearly half the revenue the charity spent that year and about eight times what the injured troops and the children of fallen ones received. .......... \"",

   "Lying liberal snakes.\n \n Answering False Accusations \n \n 1. The blog posting accuses our friend Sean Hannity of personally benefiting from Freedom Alliance. This is FALSE. Freedom Alliance has never provided planes, hotels, cars, limos, or anything else to Sean. Sean gets nothing from Freedom Alliance except our gratitude for his personal generosity and for all he has done to help the troops and our organization. We have never had to ask Sean for anything, he always generously offers his help before we have a chance to ask him. But to be clear Sean pays for all his own transportation, hotels, and all related expenses for himself and his family and friends and staff, which over the years has added up to tens of thousands of dollars. He does not use any Freedom Alliance Funds or Concert funds in any way, period. \n \n 2. Sean Hannity has contributed $100,000 to the Wounded Warriors Foundation, over $200,000 to the Freedom Alliance, and over tens of thousands of dollars to other military charities and individuals. We only make this information public because of the outrageous slander against him. Sean has no management or operational involvement in, or control over, Freedom Alliance. He has been a selfless patriot in his efforts to raise funds for the education of children of armed services personnel. \n \n 3. The blog posting accuses Freedom Alliance of spending less than 20% of money raised on program activities. This is FALSE. Listed below are the amounts that Freedom Alliance spent for each of the past three years and the categories on which they were spent. The figures are taken from our Federal Form 990 which is filed with the Internal Revenue Service and posted on our web site and audited by an independent auditor using Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. This financial record not only meets, but exceeds standards of program efficiency set by most charity evaluators. \n \n 4. In 2008, Freedom Alliance spent a total of $6,745,717. Of that: \n \n \u0095 79 percent ($5,317,970) was spent on Program Activities \n \n \u009514 percent ($945,950) was spent on Fundraising \n \n \u00957 percent ($481,797) was spent on Management \n \n In 2007, Freedom Alliance spent a total of $7,461,350. Of that: \n \n \u0095 81.5 percent ($6,084,474) was spent on Program Activities \n \n \u0095 13.5 percent ($1,011,501) was spent on Fundraising \n \n \u0095 5 percent ($365,375) was spent on Management \n \n In 2006, Freedom Alliance spent a total of $7,064,839. Of that:\n \u0095 77 percent ($5,434,538) was spent on Program Activities \n \n \u0095 18.5 percent ($1,308,414) was spent on Fundraising \n \n \u0095 4.5 percent ($321,887) was spent on Management \n \n 5. The blog posting accuses Freedom Alliance of spending money intended for student scholarships on other expenses. This is FALSE. Freedom Alliance has distributed $3.4 million in Scholarships and created a Scholarship Trust Fund with the additional money that we have raised for that program. That fund now contains $15 million, over $10 million of which has been raised by Hannity and the concerts. Our scholarship program is managed with the understanding that it will be needed for at least the next 20 years as there are children who will ultimately receive a scholarship who are now only a few years old. As indicated on our Federal Form 990, these funds are restricted and used only for future scholarships. \n \n 6. Our Scholarship Fund is one of four programs operated by Freedom Alliance. Supporters may donate to a specific program or for general operating purposes. In 2008, Freedom Alliance received $2.1 million in scholarship donations. The same year, we awarded $802,250 in scholarships and applied $1.3 million to our Scholarship Trust Fund. The funds donated by Sean Hannity directly -- or through the proceeds of the Freedom Concerts -- and the support of thousands of Americans are used for these purposes: \n \n \u0095 Freedom Alliance Scholarship Fund: Providing scholarships to those whose parents have been killed or severely injured in their service to our Country. There is now over $15 million in the scholarship fund for the students as they come of age. \n \n The American Spectator : AmSpecBlog : Freedom Alliance Statement on Debbie Schlussel Attack",

   "And the truth lies somewhere inbetween.....\n \n I figured most people would ignore this since Simone posted it but seeing as one individual responded I'll chime in. I realize both of you are not accountants but it doesn't take one to read form 990..mainly Part IX that shows what you need to see. Actually, freedom alliance is even better in they give you exactly who got the money at the very end of their online form which can be found here:\n \n http://www.freedomalliance.org/images/pdf_and_largepics/2008_990.pdf\n \n A tiny bit over 20% went to helping folks. This is NOT the same calculation as the 75% figure Simone refers to as a \"good charity\". For example doing the same thing with the American Diabetes Association would yield 17%. \n \n Frankly I think the ADA and Freedom Alliance should do a lot better but to say one is a scam is to say many other reputable charities are scams and that just isn't true.",

   "It's a \"scam\". So are most organised charities. Spend some time with them and you'll quickly become disillusioned. Think of them as a business selling feeling good to chumps, and employing lazy hags with no interest in the activities of the organisation but pleased by the way they don't have to work very hard. \n \n It's sort of like government, except that it doesn't steal its revenue and its activities generally don't include killing people. Unless you count Africa where charitable \"aid\" has propped up governments that kill people.\n \n \nA \"reasonable\" charity spends 25% or less on administration. \n\n \n Please don't be ignorant.",
