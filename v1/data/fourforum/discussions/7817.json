   "Anyone here know anything about living with diverticular disease? I had been to the ER with severe abdominal pain last week, and after many tests and 10 hours, sent home with a diagnosis for diverticulitis, a script for antibiotics, and a referal for a GI doc. 5 days later, I went back to the same ER with the same symptoms, only worse. I got released from the hospital 5 days later after many narcotics and IV antibiotics...today. I now have a lot more information about the disease, what causes flare-ups, and it's treatments, but I am looking for the \"man on the street\" type of personal experience. Does anyone else have any personal experience with this?",

Several years ago on one of our car trips it layed him out flat for a day. If you get a flareup try drinking cranberry juice and eating saltine crackers or yeast free matzas. His is caused by yeast so you could try getting your doctor to do a yeast test that could be a start. I have also heard that eating yogurt can help replace some of the good bacteria into your intestines.",
