   "Problem is that not all spaniards are going to be good at preparing spanish food, and there are some people of other nationalities just as capable of producing spanish food. Treating people as groups doesn't work. Also, ability to produce spanish food well has nothing whatsoever to do with race, it has to do with upbringing. If a black south african baby was adopted by two spanish chefs, chances are he's going to end up pretty good at cooking spanish food. On the flip side, a spanish baby adopted by a white american family whose idea of good food is McDonalds, chances are he won't have a chance in hell of cooking spanish food.\n \n Any characteristics attributable to race are pretty much universally cosmetic, or only emerge from averages over such enormous populations that they are meaningless.",

   "Depending on circumstance, you could just advertise for those good at making spanish food, or if talking to a group of people, ask if any of them can make good spanish food. If you want to categorise people on the basis of certain qualities, then do it on those qualties, not the colour of their skin. It might take marginally more effort on your part, but given the history of race relations, I think it's a price worth paying for everyone to be treated as people.\n \n For the record I'm not keen on affirmative action, mainly because it is a blunt instrument. The root causes of black underachievement are the same as for anyone else - poverty, family problems etc. Sure there is greater poverty among black americans, on average, due to historical factors; but there are some wealthy blacks, and some dirt poor whites.
