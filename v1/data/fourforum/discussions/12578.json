   "To read the four newly released memos on prisoner interrogation written by George W. Bush&#8217;s Justice Department is to take a journey into depravity.\n \n Their language is the precise bureaucratese favored by dungeon masters throughout history. They detail how to fashion a collar for slamming a prisoner against a wall, exactly how many days he can be kept without sleep (11), and what, specifically, he should be told before being locked in a box with an insect &#8212; all to stop just short of having a jury decide that these acts violate the laws against torture and abusive treatment of prisoners.\n \n In one of the more nauseating passages, Jay Bybee, then an assistant attorney general and now a federal judge, wrote admiringly about a contraption for waterboarding that would lurch a prisoner upright if he stopped breathing while water was poured over his face. He praised the Central Intelligence Agency for having doctors ready to perform an emergency tracheotomy if necessary.\n\n http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/19/opinion/19sun1.html\n \n It makes me sick that this monster Bybee is now a federal judge. A huge black eye for America.",
