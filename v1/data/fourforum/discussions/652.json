   "Perhaps you have heard the saying / quote : \" A butterfly that flaps its wings in China, affects weather patterns in new york \"\n This saying is a drastic, rare, complicated example of the chaos theory. Acctaully I don't see how a butterfly can affect weather, but I don't think thats the relevant point of it.\n \n The butterfly affects weather \n From such a distance - With such a small action\n The butterfly is something, very small and insignificant compared to NYC which is exactly why its a good comparison. \n \n Another example, if you haven't caught on already...\n \n \"A nail brings the kingdom to its doom\"\n \n \"For want of a nail, the shoe was lost;\n For want of a shoe, the horse was lost;\n For want of a horse, the rider was lost;\n For want of a rider, a message was lost;\n For want of a message the battle was lost;\n For want of a battle, the kingdom was lost!\"\n \n That breaks it down for you. \n \n It would seem to me that the Chaos Theory is not a theory, but fact. How could anyone have skepticism to such a simple concept. But a concept as this, which I hope to prove in time is the very reason why I find it doubtful that we have any free will at all.\n Now your tempted to x out of this post, going away thinking this guy is an idiot but I plan to explain with my next few posts on this thread unless I have any controversy. To enlighten those willing I must establish one point at a time, therfor we can move to the bigger picture. \n \n I'm going to leave the first post of this thread here. \n \n Any controversy that you have or any valid reason, that you think the Chaos Theory can only be an opinion, pease let me know. \n (I plan to post the continuance of this within the next 4 days)\n \n If you do not fully understand the Chaos Theory please read or go over the main points of this paper written by a student at Duke.\n http://www.duke.edu/~mjd/chaos/chaos.html\n \n \n \n Thanks for reading this\n \n \n Always Stay Open Minded",

   "\"But a concept as this, which I hope to prove in time is the very reason why I find it doubtful that we have any free will at all.\"\n \n Prior to the 19th century, when Henri Poincar\u00e9 debunked the idea that reducing uncertainty in the reported initial conditions could effectively decrease the error produced in long-term system behavior; most scientists subscribed to a deterministic view of the material universe. When it was demonstrated by him, and later Edward Lorenz, that minuscule errors inherent in the precision of our instruments, the limitations of infinitely reporting initial conditions (it is impossible to report a number with 100% accuracy because of the nature of infinity), and the complexity of the system produces errors that propagate, in the long run, as huge errors in the predicted behavior, the idea of scientific determinism was severely questioned. These principles constitute what is known as the \"butterfly effect\", which is caused by uncertainty of measurement and dynamic instability. This is generally what is meant when people speak of chaos in this context. \n \n If anything, chaos has thrown a wrench in scientists long sought-after deterministic framework of the universe, and does nothing to advance the idea that human behavior is somehow predetermined. Anyone suggesting that chaos theory provides evidence that free will is a farce does not fully grasp the concept.\n \n The idea that chaos can be studied to predict social behavior, like market systems and historical patterns, comes from the observation that although chaos reigns in complex systems, general patterns tend to arise. This is what has allowed some scientists to continue their quest for the materialistic determinism that they seek. They say that randomness is necessary for any large-scale deterministic framework of the universe to be applied. In fact, some have implicated chaos as the reason for \"time's arrow\". Others question whether or not it is accurate to say that the universe is deterministic, if such randomness abounds in the universe. \n \n As you can see, the age-old debate of free will versus determinism has not been adequately answered. Only through further investigation will this question be answered. As for now it is still hotly debated among scientists and philosophers.",

   "The dictionary defenition of free will is the following:\n \n free will\n n. \n The ability or discretion to choose; free choice: chose to remain behind of my own free will. \n The power of making free choices that are unconstrained by external circumstances or by an agency such as fate or divine will. \n \n Alot of people will simply say that free will is choice. To continue we must agree on a defenition of which I am speaking. Choice.\n \n Simple examples of choice are:\n \n \n 1. Which way do you turn at the next light?\n 3. Should you go to sleep now or stay up longer?\n 4. Do you want a refill on your drink, or not?\n \n \n \n These are all decisions that are made every day by alot of people.\n \n When you go to decide thse things your decision is based upon an \"infinite\" number of variables. \n \n The decision you are going to make with 100% accuracy will not be calculated within my lifetime, nor do I think its even possible for it to. There are simply 2 many variables.\n \n 1. Your decision to turn left or right can be based alot more then what you think. Although it still has a limited amount of options: Turn Right, Turn Left, Don't turn either way, there are probably some more that I'm not thinking of. Because I beleive that everything we do is based upon an equation that mankind will never be able to calculate let us pretend we have the equation here in front of us. \n A large variable in this equation is where are you trying to go. Are you trying to drive around aimlessley? Are you going downtown, or out of town for the weekend. There are an \"infinite\" number of things you could be doing. Lets say your origonal intention is to go downtown so to do this you should take a right. You come to the light and to the left see two freinds walking down the street carrying a video which appears to be from the video store. Your thoughts quickly change as they do always. But your thoughts are going down a diffrent path then if you hadn't seen those people. Suddenly you remember XXXX, those movies I rented a few days ago are late. So now you don't take the origonal intention of a right turn. Instead you turn left, in the direction of the video store, because you happen to have the videos in the back of the car.\n Now the choice of still turning right and returning the videos later was an option. This choice was turned down do to other variables. Are you completely broke? Are you worried about next months phone bill? Did you just get fired? A small variable concerning the tempature of the car could have even helped to turn down this choice.\n Small variables such as the car tempature, change how you feel, how you feel changes your thoughts, your thoughts change your actions. \n \n Thats all for now.\n More to come and a more in depth look at 2. \n \n -- I may or may not address oposition to this post next time but I certainly do not plan to ignore it. \n \n Always Stay Open Minded",

   "There are plenty of arguments to support the idea complexity empower the role of agency. However, this does not necessarily mean that complexity is an agency foccused approach. The idea of a more deterministic chaos is that real patters could be discerned, regardless of how 'complex' they are. Arguing about complexity is too vague, for a firm term. People often use it as a synonym of chaos, which causes all types of confusion and invalid statements. One must realize that time is not a reversible process, and it is precisely in that irreversability that complexity prospers. Ilya Prigogine makes this point in the vast majority of his published works. It is clear that some have tried to create a link between complexity and post-structuralism. However, others have consecutively rejected this because they do not recognise the 'poetic' character of temporality in complexity science. \n \n There are, evidently, many arguments that give evidence to the fact that complexity represents a major epistemic shift, which produces various paradoxical results.\n \n For all centuries many scientists have been searching for a simple theory that links all of the systems of the Universe. Einstein began to work on this, as someone in this forum rightfully said. The first significant scientific hope for this has been the chaos theory. \n \n The main argument against appears to be \"there is no pattern for randomity\". In this, I would have to answer that I do not believe in randomness, but rather in emerging order.\n \n It has been shown that fractal geometry provides a new way to explore and measure nature. Things, long ago, labelled \"mathematical monstrotities\" are now called fractals. \n \n Both Franctals are prevelent in nature. Weather appears to be the greatest example of chaos, and the clouds are the fractals. Fractal can also be seen in the Brownian motion. The motion exibited by particles in a hot liquid. The particles move with random, zig zag pattersn, which can be plotted. \n \n If the chaos theory has done one thing, it certainly has revolutionised the way scientists think. I'll stop blabbing on now, and let others in. \n \n **************\n \n Some quotations:\n \n It may happen that small differences in the initial conditions produce very great ones in the final phenomena. A small error in the former will produce an enormous error in the latter. Prediction becomes impossible.\" - Henri Poincare \n \n The intricacies of insect flight are astounding. But the animals' small size and swift movements make detailed studies of their aerodynamic acrobatics difficult. Now results of a study of free-flying butterflies published today in the journal Nature suggest that the insects rely on a variety of techniques, often employed in successive strokes, over the course of a flight. R. B. Srygley and Adrian L.R. Thomas of the University of Oxford trained red admiral butterflies to fly toward a fake flower at the end of a wind tunnel. Photographs snapped as the insects moved through wisps of smoke in the chamber provided the researchers with an opportunity to analyze their flight patterns. Specifically, the scientists matched patterns in the airflow around the butterflies' wings to standard mathematical patterns with known properties. They determined that the creatures use a number of \"unconventional aerodynamic mechanisms to generate force.\" What is more astounding, writes Rafal Zbikowski of Cranfield University in an accompanying commentary, is that \"the butterflies appear to switch effortlessly among these mechanisms from stroke to stroke.\" Indeed, he concludes, if engineers ever succeed in understanding just how insects exercise control over such a wide range of abilities, \"there will be a revolution in aeronautics.\" \n --Sarah Graham, Scientific American December 12, 2002/\n \n A new conception was being made....that whatever fundamental units the world is put together from,they are more delicate,more fugitive,more startling than we catch in the Butterfly Net of our senses.\n -Jacob Bronowski, The Ascent of Man.",
