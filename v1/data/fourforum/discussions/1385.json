   "I think probably more important is whether it is more important to be persuasive or to be right? Is it important to be persuasive at all?\n \n I guess it depends on what you want out of a debate. If you want to know what is right (what is the [more likely] right thing to do in a prescriptive debate; what is [more likely] true in a descriptive debate), then there is really no sense in being persuasive; is there? There is no necessary correlation between correctness and persuasiveness. For example, sales people very often are pretty convincing, and, as so often known, some of them aren't at all truthful. Would it be wise, then, to lie in a debate so long as the other person doesn't find out?\n \n So I guess I don't see a point in trying to be persuasive in a debate as much as to be right. Certainly there are arguments as to exactly what is right. I think that everyone would accept that ontological correctness or correctness by deductive logic is considered the only absolute \"rightness\". There are certain facts that can be seen as right, while not provable in a deductive sense -- say epistemological facts. For example, \"if I release a rock in mid air, it will fall\" is probably considered true while it's not ontologically true as nothing guarantees that. What people use more often is inductive or probabilistic infererence (I guess you can just as well say that epistemological facts are just highly probable inductive inferences) -- as an aside, most people who use this type or argument is wrong [even this statement in itselve is probably wrong]. The more objective view at probabilistic inference is of course to group all of your known premises into a set of events E and to calculate P(C|E) for C your conclusion. If P(C|E) is within epsilon of 1, then your conclusion is acceptable -- people don't do this at all, and so you get statements such as \"some MACs perform better than some PCs, so MACs perform better than PCs\" (while \"perform\" here is ambiguous, the statement still illustates the fallacy), which is clearly flawed.\n \n Okay, so let's summarize my digression before moving on:\n 1. being persuasive is not important in a debate\n 2. being right is important in a debate, and the followings are ways to be right:\n 2a. deduction (there many subclasses of this) give absolute correctness\n 2b. application of epistemological facts\n 2c. probabilistic inference\n \n \n With all of that aside, how to be persuasive? Persuasion is really a psychological problem. I certainly don't know anything astounding about the subject, but many obvious things seem to work. The best thing to do seems to be to find out about the person and assume his/her superiority, and, most of all, appealing to the other person. For example, if you are arguing against a mother on how bad the war in Iraq is, maybe bringing up parents of dead soldiers would help. Again, it really depends, obviously, on the other person, so it's hard to say whether there is a set of \"work for all\" rules to be persuasive.\n \n And finally, NEVER EVER, in a debate, make a proposition without backing arguments.",

   "I have a few statements to make about the confrontation between Silentpoet and Dreamweaver. I believe that it is reasonable that a Christian would find Silentpoet's statement offensive. How come in this politically correct world a person can't talk out against radical Islam without being called a Muslim-hating hypocrite, but he is able to make vicious attacks on Christianity? Is it because Christians are too intolerant to be considered as a valid part of an argument or are the people attacking them just being intolerant themselves? Gilligan, your talking about being open-minded and how critical that is and you go and tell dreamweaver to \"shut it\". Question: Isn't that being narrow-minded? I also hate that everyone has to resort to personal attacks such as dream weaver's infamous quote \"Please, do feel free to put your shift key into full use.

The best lesson I ever learned was to shut up and listen .... and I mean really listen. Many times in a sales (or debate) situation, one can concentrate so much on what he are going to say that he fails to really hear what is being said. When teaching sales techniques, I used to demonstrate this with the following story: Feel free to take notes. You get on your bus at exactly 5:19 pm and drive 2.7 miles due north. You make a left turn and go exactly 2 miles, stop and pick up a red-headed boy with glasses. You turn left again and go 1.7 miles where you pick up a girl with a red hat holding a lunch pail on her left hand. Total combined weight of the boy and girl is 162 pounds. You then drive 4.2 miles and drop them off at school. 2.73 gallons of gas was used. Using the information I have given you, how old is the bus driver .... hands only? Try this on a group sometime.

One lived, one died, and one was raised. The first life is over. Resurrection begins the second.\n\n \n In regards to the 1st, most everything the Christ did was controversial from a Jewish standpoint. He was a regular heretic with will claims...and alleged miricales to back them up.\n \n To the 2nd, I personally agree. History is full of puffed up tales and fabrications. It could easily appear that His followers were shoe-horning their guru to fit into prophesies previously made.\n \n To the 3rd, just another interpretation.",

One can say that those readers are not worth the effort but, frankly, the last elections in the US largely seemed to be determined by that sort of reader / voter. There has to be a technique which one can use to disuade such a reader from being convinced by the confidence of a belligerently irrational poster.\n\n Problem is like it or not that is the world in which we operate.\n \n Perhaps if you are worried about your opponent's techniques being so effective it would be wise to study them and reply with the like.",

It disturbs me that the rhethoric used by this administration is particularly filled with propaganda compared to other Republican administrations that I have encountered in my life. I first became old enough to be politically aware during the first Bush administration and I don't ever remember the rhethoric (outside of some non-mainstream politicians) being this extreme as it is now. The extreme and propaganda filled rhethoric seemed to significantly ratchet up with the onset of the power of neo-conservatives in the 1990s, and especially with the onset of this administration. The moderate Republicans would seem like a breath of fresh air in comparison.\n \n In contrast, though there certainly might be extremist Democratic posters in this forum and the occasional far-left Democratic politician, most Democrats have shifted closer to the center in the last decades. The harsh criticism of the Democrats against the Republicans also generally seems to focus on specific actions on the part of those Republicans - not sweeping generalizations. What mainstream Democratic claims against the Republicans would you say are extreme and unsupported (as the accusation of anti-partiotism is, for example, on the part of Republicans)?\n \n On a side note, all of this commentary applies to mainstream politics in the US. Where posters in this forum are concerned, I think the nature of forums tends to attract people with more one-sided views than it does moderates. So, many of the posters here probably do show more one-sided emotional responses than does the average Democratic politician.",

Avoid being stump by their attacks.\n \n 2. Catch phases - (i.e. Executing a murderer is directly proportionate to robbing a robber or raping a rapist) only 1 thing to say, they stick to your mind and most importantly the judges.\n \n 3. Speak loud and clear in a proper manner. Show no sign of anger or panic. If you can accomplish this you may have achieved 2 things: a) Make your opposition angry b) Show your confidence and draw the judges attention to you.\n \n 4. Formality - this always help when you're trying to make a point. It gives your statements a stronger authority.\n \n 5. Factual evidence - these are always good. It's even better if you have the actual evidence or statistic to display to the panel of judges. Arguments are always more believable with some kind of back ups.\n \n 6. Dress up!! - Researchs showed that a person who dressed nicely created a better impression and cause the judges to think that he take the argument seriously.\n \n Hope this help.:)",
