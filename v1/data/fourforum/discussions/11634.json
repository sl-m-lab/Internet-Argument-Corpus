   "Georgian authorities aren't nut-cases if they have decided to overestimate the expenses for revival of their economy, suffered from recent Russian retaliatory actions, as they say. It is as if Russia has fully destroyed Georgian economy and before August 8, 2008 Georgia was not received EU funds for economic recovery at all! \n I think that Saakashvili and his team simply play the fool with EU because they are going to get additional funds from Europe without any control or expectations on the part of EU. Thus, EU needs to organize the monitoring of Georgian outlays that will require large money injections from us! But now, in difficult conditions of financial crisis, we cannot go to such great expenses. And financial backing, into which doing our overseas allies are surprised us now, turns into a very large dead-weight for EU!",
