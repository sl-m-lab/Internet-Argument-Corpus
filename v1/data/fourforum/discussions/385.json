We see our government as good, because we like it, and simply because we're used to it. That doesn't give us the right to judge other people and say that they are wrong, and then proceed to impose our believe system on them. \n As a US citizen, I frankly believe we are in it for the money, because that's all the majority of the US cares about. So then again, is our belief system the right one?\n \n Ok, My weak point. I don't know the government, the constitution and all that (I went to a public school, of course we never learned that)\n But I believe it may be in there somewhere that we cannot forcefully impose our government on opposing nations. (I apologize if it's not in there and I'm making a fool of myself. - I probably am)\n Either way, I think this whole mess is a bad thing.\n I do believe that we had to stop some of what was going on over there, just because it was getting out of hand, but do we really need to stick around there this long?\n \n off the topic\n (Oh, and did you know there's this huge war going on in Africa (Called the African World War or something) that no one really knows about?
