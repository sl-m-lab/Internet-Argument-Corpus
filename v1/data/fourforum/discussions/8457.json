   "We have all sorts of laws in the USA that limit access to guns. Youngsters can't lawfully buy handguns. The trouble is that people who intend to commit crimes with a gun have already decided that laws don't apply to them. If a young fellow plans to rob a store, or shoot a homey, he's not going to be thwarted in his quest for a gun by a law that says he can't have it.\n \n Our problem with crime is that we are way too lenient with young, first-time offenders. We give them too many chances before we lock them up for a long time.\n \n Most violent crime is committed by a very small percentage of the population. Lock up that small percentage --or as many of them as we can catch-- and crime rates would plummet.\n \n It has nothing to do with guns, as such.

   "This is not what the Supreme Court has ruled regarding the Second Amendment.\n\n \n I understand that, and although I understand case law has become important, I ask where the Constitution gives them that power. They are to interpret the Constitution, not decide what they think it means. There are some vague places, like what constitutes a reasonable search and seizure. That's up to them to interpret. But the second amendment is VERY clear.\n \n \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State\" - dependant clause explaining why this action is necessary\n \n \"The right of the people\" - assuming all citizens are people, a newborn baby is a person\n \n \"to keep and bear Arms\" - this would include any gun\n \n \"shall not be infringed\" - infringed means not even slightly regulated.\n \n How much clearer can it get? Can someone else come up with an alternative meaning to this statement in plain English? I'd like to know, because so far all I've heard is that \"They couldn't possibly have forseen today's weapons\". And that is pure :xcensored because this is a principle here. If the weapons exist, the people have the right to keep and bear them. If we want to amend the Constitution, it's 2/3 of Congress plus 3/4 of the people. Honestly why don't we do that? I think we have enough people against kids owning guns to pass an amendment to the second amendment or else the 13th saying that kids don't have quite as many rights. But as of now, unless someone can explain to me my error in logic in interpreting an english phrase, prohibiting a kid from owning a weapon is unconstitutional (note schools can ban them as can any other place, but we can't ban them in public).",

   "They are to interpret the Constitution, not decide what they think it means.\n\n Um, that's what interpret means...\n \n Zach, the general approach to such issues is to look at the intent of the people who wrote the law. If I may, I will paste something I've written elsewhere:\n \n \nLet us look at what the committee presented to the rest of the House:\n \nA well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, being the best security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed, but no person religiously scrupulous shall be compelled to bear arms.\n\n It is abundantly clear that the rationale for \"the people\" to keep and bear arms is that the source of a militia, which is necessary for security, is \"the people.\" Furthermore, we can see from the latter part of the proposed amendment that the committee specifically wanted to avoid implying that pacifists were required to bear arms for the purpose of national security. This makes absolutely no sense if the explanatory clause's reference to the militia has no effective meaning, but it makes perfect sense if the reference to the militia was pertinent. According to several sources cited in the U.S. v. Miller decision, militiamen were expected to supply their own weapons if called into duty, which requires owning guns and ammunition. This is perfectly harmonious with the interpretation that is already sufficently clear.\n \n In other words, \"Because a militia is necessary, and because the militia is composed of the people, the people need to be armed; however, we are not saying that 'the people must be armed so that they can serve in the militia.'\"\n\n Of course, it was a bit more clear in the context of the other conversation, but this should suffice.",

   "Let me enter this discussion.\n \n I believe U.S. v. Miller is a case wrongly decided; but it cannot be read to protect only the RKBA of militia members. Miller was a bootlegger. He was a private citizen who was not a member of any state militia. If the Miller court wanted to limit the RKBA to only members of state organized militias, it would have dismissed his second amendment claim by saying something like this: \"The defendant is not a member of a state organized militia, and is therefore not a member of that class of persons the amendment protects. Therefore, he lacks standing to pursue a claim that his second amendment rights have been infringed.\" \n \n Additionally, this is how the Miller Court defined the militia:\n \n \"The signification attributed to the term Militia appears from the debates in the Convention, the history and legislation of the Colonies and the States, and the writings of approved commentators. These show plainly enough that the militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. \"A body of citizens enrolled for military discipline.\" And further, that ordinarily when called for service these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of a kind in common use at the time.\" United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174, 179 (1939).\n \n Miller's appeal was denied not because he was a private citizen who claimed the second amendment protected his RKBA, rather, his appeal was denied because the Court would not read the amendment to protect his RKBA in a sawed-off shotgun:\n \n \"In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a 'shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length' at this time has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument. Certainly, it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.\" Id. at 178.\n \n What you see from this decision is a clear implication that private citizens do enjoy a RKBA and the scope of that right protects arms which are \"part of the ordinary military equipment\" or which \"could contribute to the common defense.\" This is a foolish interpretation of the RKBA, because it could be read to protect a RKBA in a flamethrower or a bomber.\n \n Now as for the militia preamble, I have addressed that here: http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=6957. \n \n I would also consider the distinct phrase \"the right of the people,\" because it is not limited to the Second Amendment. The phrase \"the right of the people\" occurs in the 1st., 2nd., and 4th. amendments. As has been stated before by people smarter than me, it cannot refer to a right of the individual citizen in the 1st. amendment, be mutated into a right of the states to arm their militia members in the 2nd. amendment, only to be magically transformed back into an individual right in the 4th. \n \n ---\n \n \"The great ideals of liberty and equality are preserved against the assaults of opportunism, the expediency of the passing hour, the erosion of small encroachments, the scorn and derision of those who have no patience with general principles, by enshrining them in constitutions, and consecrating to the task of their protection a body of defenders.\" Justice Benjamin Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process, New haven, 1921.\n \n \"Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Government's purposes are beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil-minded rulers. The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding.\" Justice Brandeis, Olmstead v.

It does not give me any ability to divide truth from lies any better than anyone else. In fact I think a law degree is usually a hindrance, because in my opinion the swelled heads people tend to get when they get admitted to the bar often constricts the blood flow to their brains. When that happens we lawyers try to conceal our newfound stupidity with arrogance. \n \n The phrase you cite means to me that if there was evidence that a particular weapon \"has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia\" then the 2nd. Amendment would protect an individual citizen's right to possess it. The Court did not say Miller's sawed-off shotgun did not meet this criteria. It merely said that no evidence was presented that it did. This obviously begs the question of how you meet this test. I think the Miller Court goes on to announce that one way to prove this would be by presenting evidence that it was \"part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.\"\n \n This was a newly created standard which no one had heard before, and for this reason no one thought to present evidence in the trial court that a sawed-off shotgun was \"part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.\" Miller's case came before the court because of an activist trial court judge who wanted to see the law struck down. Miller promptly jumped bond on his appeal, and no one appeared to argue his case. The Government was the only party to appear before the Court, and no evidence was presented to SCOTUS to establish that the weapon would meet the newly announced test. This is why the Court says \"In the absence of any evidence tending to show....\" \n \n This brings me back to the \"judicial notice\" comment. SCOTUS said \"Certainly, it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.\" I see this as the test SCOTUS announces for proving a weapon \"has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia.\" It is the only reason why SCOTUS would mention it. \n \n The \"judicial notice\" comment occurs for this reason: In our courts many facts do not need to be proved by direct evidence. There are certain facts which Courts routinely take \"judicial notice\" as being true, like calendar dates or information contained in its own records. When SCOTUS goes on to say \"Certainly, it is not within judicial notice...\" it is saying that no one tried to prove the weapon would meet this new test, and absent any evidence proving this it will assume on its own that a sawed-off shotgun would be \"part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.\" \n \n So I read Miller to interpret the scope of the 2nd. Amendment as protecting an individual RKBA in weapons which have \"some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia;\" and the test for establishing this is proof that the particular weapon is \"part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.\" It is a dangerous decision if followed, because it opens the door for claims to all sorts of current military arms.\n \n ---\n \"The issue, however, is not whether court rules are \"mutable\"; they assuredly are. It is not whether, in the light of \"various circumstances,\" they can be \"modifi[ed]\"; they assuredly can. The issue is whether, as mutated and modified, they must make sense. The requirement that they do so is the only thing that prevents this Court from being some sort of nine-headed Caesar, giving thumbs-up or thumbs-down to whatever outcome, case by case, suits or offends its collective fancy.\" Justice Scalia, DICKERSON v. UNITED STATES, 530 U.S. ___ 995525, Slip opinion (Scalia's dissent) p.12 (June 26, 2000).",

   "Thank you for your well-written response. I suppose I should have expected as much, given your profession and your posting history.\n \n \nListen, being a lawyer is only a license to pretend I know what I'm talking about... [snip] \n\n Well, even then, I figure your that experience with legal decisions should not be ignored. That is something I lack, even if I only pretend that I know what I'm talking about, too...\n \n \nThe phrase you cite means to me that if there was evidence that a particular weapon \"has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia\" then the 2nd. Amendment would protect an individual citizen's right to possess it. .... I think the Miller Court goes on to announce that one way to prove this would be by presenting evidence that it was \"part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.\"\n \n\n Once again, I have to concede that I don't think it's totally unreasonable to interpret it that way. However, I instead interpret the \"judicial notice\" clause as being all that is (was) necessary to determine whether the weapon in question is protected, which was the purpose of hearing the case (if I am not mistaken). (As a rough representation, think of a rhetorical question: \"How can it be useful for the militia if it isn't ordinary military equipment and doesn't even contribute to the common defense?\") To put it another way, although a \"no\" answer to (either of) those questions would disqualify it, a \"yes\" answer to both isn't sufficient for qualification. For the purposes of this case, however, affirming disqualification was all that was necessary.\n \n \nMiller promptly jumped bond on his appeal, and no one appeared to argue his case.\n\n Hmm... According to my reading, while it is true that nobody argued his case, Miller had died, not elected to forego appearing. [The specifics of Miller's actions are, of course, a side issue here.]\n \n I realize that my position isn't so much a counterargument as a different interpretation, but I wanted to put it out there and see what happened. I also realize that my interpretation gives us no real test for protection, but I (again, in my lay opinion) don't see that as a detrimental issue, only a problematic one no worse than that which follows from your interpretation. If you have any further commentary or argument (especially regarding the law or conventions of legal decisions of which I'm not aware), please share.",

   "You're right that Miller had died, but it appears he was alive when the case was presented to SCOTUS. This is the timeline as I understand it:\n \n On March 30, 1939, SCOTUS heard the oral arguments in the case. No one appeared to argue the case except the Government.\n \n On April 6, 1939, Miller's body was found in a creek bed near Chelsea, Oklahoma. He had been shot 4 times with a .38 caliber weapon. Near his body was a .45 automatic from which three shots had been fired, which law enforcement presumed was done in self-defense.\n \n On May 15, 1939, SCOTUS, unaware that Miller was dead, announced and published its decision on his case.\n \n Interestingly, his co-defendant, Frank Layton, plead guilty to his indictment after SCOTUS decided the case, and he was placed on probation for five years which he successfully completed.\n \n I found an excellent U.S. v. Miller website, which has full copies of the opinion, brief filed by the Government, all related petitions, etc. here: \n \n http://www.rkba.org/research/miller/Miller.html. \n \n I still think Miller is a gun rights opinion. In addition to what you can see in the opinion itself, if you look at the paragraph we have focused upon that begins \"In the absence of...\" you will see SCOTUS cite with approval to another case, Aymette v. State. If you look at the case and page SCOTUS cites you to, you will find that Tennessee court saying this about militia arms: \"If the citizens have these arms in their hands, they are prepared in the best possible manner to repel any encroachments upon their rights. . . .\" Aymette v. State, 2 Hump. (21 Tenn.) 154, 158 (1840). Case cited by Miller at p. 178. (A great cite for gun rights advocates, for this is yet another statement that the purpose for relying on a citizen militia was not to ensure the government would be safe from foreign invasion, but was intended to protect the citizens from the advent of a tyrant.) \n \n But one fundamental problem with Miller is it does not clearly state what the scope of the Amendment is or how to prove a weapon is protected. It only makes reference to these things in the negative--a sort of \"since you didn't prove this you can't prove the 2nd. Amendment protects you\" decision. It also leaves several 2nd.Amendment questions unanswered. Is the right \"fundamental\" and deserving of the high standard of strict scrutiny of governmental attempts to infringe upon it? Should it allow the possession of current military hardware? If so, then would the RKBA be limited to these weapons, or would my old single-shot arcade .22 be protected? Should the 2nd. Amendment RKBA be incorporated through the 14th. Amendment to force the states to recognize it? For these reason I feel that Miller is a very poor opinion to use to underpin a coherent understanding of the nature and scope of the RKBA.",

   "Bryan, I am again impressed by your ability to track down information.\n \n I find myself agreeing with you on interpretation. I think the Aymette reference to \"private broils\" and \"robber and assassin\" probably speak to the intent with which arms are or are not protected, but even \"non-standard\" arms could be useful in war, and -- as you point out -- Aymette includes no applicable test in any case.\n \n (Wow, this is a mess.

   "Actually, I appreciate the opportunity to talk to someone rather than shout at them. One of my vices is I don't suffer fools gladly. I will try to humiliate people who first do two things: 1. attack/insult me, and 2. then do something I can humiliate them with. You have done neither. I have been on other sites where people are not interested in learning about a subject. They have their minds made up, and any attempt to speak contrary thoughts to them quickly draws forth junior high school insults about parentage. One of the reasons why I like this site is you rarely see that here. I don't pretend to have all the answers, and coming here is a learning process for me. I learn a lot more from talking and listening to people as opposed to shouting at them. It makes me a better advocate when I consider other viewpoints. I'm glad you feel the same way.\n \n As far as my job goes, very little of this has any impact on me. The irony is that as such a strong supporter of the RKBA I spend a lot of time making sure people go to jail for misusing firearms or for merely having them in their homes if they are felons. I have never seen anyone attempt to stop a prosecution of a gun use/possession crime on 2nd. Amendment grounds in Virginia. And I can find no Virginia state court case that has ever dealt with the issue. Life goes on while we wait to see if SCOTUS will ever take the issue on and let the other shoe drop.\n \n ---\n \n \"And indeed, gentlemen, there exists a law, not written down anywhere but written in our hearts; a law which comes to us not by training or custom or reading but by derivation and absorption and adoption from nature itself; a law which has come to us not by theory but from practice, not by instruction but by natural intuition. I refer to the law which lays it down that, if our lives are endangered by plots or violence or armed robbers or enemies, any and every method of protecting ourselves is morally right. When weapons reduce them to silence, the laws no longer expect one to await their pronouncements. For people who decide to wait for these will have to wait for justice, too--and meanwhile they must suffer injustice first. Indeed, even the wisdom of the law itself, by a sort of tacit implication, permits self- defense, because it does not actually forbid men to kill; what it does, instead, is to forbid the bearing of a weapon with the intention to kill. When, therefore, an inquiry passes beyond the mere question of the weapon and starts to consider the motive, a man who has used arms in self-defense is not regarded as having carried them with homicidal aim.\" Cicero, Selected Political Speeches, p. 222 (M. Grant, trans. 1975)\n \n \"And I cannot see, why arms should be denied to any man who is not a slave, since they are the only true badges of liberty. . . .The possession of arms is the distinction between a freeman and a slave. He who has nothing, and belongs to another, must be defended by him, and needs no arms: but he who thinks he is his own master, and has anything he may call his own, ought to have arms to defend himself and what he possesses, or else he lives precariously and at discretion. And though for a while those who have the sword in their power abstain from doing him injury; yet, by degrees, he will be awed into submission to every arbitrary command.\" Andrew Fletcher, Political Works, pp. 35 and 221 (1749).",

Sure, kids are curious about guns, but if you take your kid out and show them what a gun can do ...that it can actually kill and teach them about it, they will be less inclined to play with it and have more respect for what it is....which is a deadly weapon and not a toy.
