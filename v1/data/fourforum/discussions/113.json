   "With the problems pointed out by the people who do not support darwin, I have asked myself is it intellegent design is not possible, then how could it work? I assumed that intellegent design is false for arguement, then made my conclutions based on the know holes.\n \n I conseived an ideal seedling for life, a single cell organizism that has over 50 chromozons, and it regresizaly evovled into different speacies as it sheald its gentic infromation. With all that infomation, in such a simple organizism left no room for speization, it would have been a generalist, and as mutaions agureed that caused to to loss infomation, though natural selection the ones that found a niche or become more specialized could compete better for resources as darwian saw. The question is that a possible begainning? That it was from simple but ordered organism to a complex highly ordered organism as it shead unneed info?\n \n Even the simplest life is highy organized, and if it was becuse of natural selection, it couldnt happen from creature with less genetic infomation, becuase like down syndorm in people, more infomation is not better. In computer programing, we want our code to be the cleanest, smallest, and optimized as possible to limit errors. This explains how something could be as complex as a mouse trap without having a creator, becuase the blue prints for the existence for the mousetrap had the potienal to exist all along, it just took the weeding out of all parts you wouldnt need to build a mouse trap.\n \n I can see the problem with this simi-circular arguement, however, it could be a possiblity that has not be though of to my knowedge.",

Don't pretend that you would grant respectful consideration to an uneducated and illiterate opinion in your field of expertise (I assume that there is such a field). Why should gomer's incomprehensible babble be given serious consideration? If you have some objection, then perhaps you could translate for us and offer an enlightened comment.\n \n Perhaps the real reason that you stay out of this forum is ignorance of the topic. You have been burned before and don't wish to be burned again. Who can blame your?",
