That started the dollar hit. Once again our bumbling administration has backed itself into a corner; sure the Chinese will buy more US exports, primarily passenger jets and technology, but using the faltering USD of which they have boatloads of while shrinking administration's desperate debt potential.

The phenomenon is nothing new, though, and nothing that any competent oil futures trader could not explain to you.\n \n Here is an article abotu the effect of dollar devaluation on oil producing contries and oil prices, including graphs showing historical trends (we can help you with the big words):\n \n http://www.mees.com/postedarticles/oped/a47n33d01.htm\n \n Mirrored movements, where the dollar price of oil moves the same as other currency prices for oil are called demand moves. They are moves related to supply and demand. \n \n Non mirrored movements are called value moves, because they do not reflect supply and demand AT ALL, they simply reflect oil price changes between the currencies due soley to valuation of the currency. The gap between the two is called the value disparity.\n \n Until the Euro emerged with realtive prominence, a basket of currencies was used to calculate relative dollar value for these calculations. Now we just use the Euro since it is essentailly representative of Euroe as a whole and you do not see much independant Euro movement.\n \n In fact, a common tactic to use in the oil market to establish the base price (also called real target) is to overlay a dollar valution chart in order to attempt to ascertain probable adjustments due to dollar devalution (or appreciation). \n \n Your scenario, which as these swings being dictated soley by supply and demand, is a nightmare scenario. If the supply/deman curve is really so tight as to justify the massive increase in oil prices we haev seen in the last year, then the entire world is screwed. Luckily, as has been pointed ut ant well documented, that is not the case. While we are facing record oil prices in the US, relative oil prices are not particularly high in the rest of the world because the lions share of our oil price increased have been value related, not demand related.\n \n Now we are at an interesting corssroads because for the first time EVERY, we are startign to see significant oil price increases based soley on supply and demand. I have seen a lot fo experts argue that as much as 20-30% of the price increase in the last year hs actually been the result of pure supply/demand as opposed to just normal opec adjustment for dollar inflation. \n \n Mule, just because the other economic ignoramouses that you apparently associate with do not understand basic commodities trading concept like inflation adjustments in oil pricing does not mean that NOBODY is talking about it. It just means that most people who are talkign about it are not completely ignorant when it comes to economics, so they are likely out of your league.\n \n I don't understand why you insist on propogating your partisan hack views on economic matters. Personally, I am neither a bear nor a bull. I really don't care one way or the other as long as the markets are moving, becuase as long as the markets move, there is opportunity for profit. Whether the movement is up or down concerns me not one iota. I am just concerned with ensuring that I judge the trend correctly, whichever way it may go. The rest of America can go to hell in its own handbasket.\n \n If you would stop trying to twist reality to fit your preconcieved predjudices, you woudl do a lot better. Take our little ford debate a while back for instance. I read the thread here and then took a hard look at fords financials, then shorted the hell out of ford. Over the next couple of weeks as their bond status was downgraded to junk and the market reacted accordingly, I made a lot of money. \n \n At our last little tiff over oil prices, I was betting we would essentially never see oil under $50 per barrel again, and buying up long term contracts like crazy to reflect that. I have made a killing on that. You, on the other hand, stated that you believed that oil would be back at $30 per barrel in 6 months. \n \n In both cases, I made a killing and had you actually followed your hunches (which I sincerely hope you did not) you would have lost your XXX. The only difference between our viewpoints is that I really don't have any wider agenda. Money has no friends, nop flags, and no loyalties. You need to learn that. Repeat it to yourself 50 times each night before you go to bed. \n \n Besides helping you to not look like a XXXXX every time you open your mouth on an economic issue, you can make a LOT more money if you base your views on reality rather than irrational exuberance.",

Oil is at roughly $72, or $22 over that $50 mark. This is the effect of speculative trading based on expectation of increased demand and the possibility (a good posibility) of decreased supply.\n \n Where you are gettign lost and loosing complete and total touch with reality is in assuming that oil is a completely freely traded commodity. it is not.

Your argument regarding 10 million extra barrels per day coming online is lala land stuff becuase it could not possibly happen.

   "And you are wrong. The significnat driving force behind oil increases has been dollar decline. There is NO QUESITON of this. When OPEC comes out ans says \"we are moving our target price to $50 per barrel due to the decline of the dollar\", that is pretty damn clear.\n \n It would probably be gambling for you since you apparently lack any understanding at all of the market and how it works. You are correct there. For many, or most, people, the market is certainly a calculated risk, but with proper analysis is no more of a gamble than the stock market. Commodities carry the exact same risk as any other investment. \n \n The $20 effect of commodity trading comes from he fact that the OPEC target for oil prices is $50. $50 is what OPEC will essentially take for their oil when factoring in devaluaiton of the dollar. Oil is at roughly $72, or $22 over that $50 mark. This is the effect of speculative trading based on expectation of increased demand and the possibility (a good posibility) of decreased supply.\n \n Where you are gettign lost and loosing complete and total touch with reality is in assuming that oil is a completely freely traded commodity. it is not. Oil has a base price set by an oil cartel, and that oil cartel will defend that base price. Your argument regarding 10 million extra barrels per day coming online is lala land stuff becuase it could not possibly happen. If some non opec country brought 10 million barrels online tomorrow, OPEC would cut production by 10 million barrels and the market would remain largely unchanged, though speculative supply concerns would ease.\n\n \n I'm really tired of arguing with you. I would rather argue with a fence post. No one agrees with you except your sycophant friends here. Believe what you want to believe. If you want to live in la-la land, be my guest. I'm not going.",

Better get used to the idea and plan accordingly.\n\n \n Yes. This is what makes the current situation interesting. For the first time in 30 yrs or more, the price of oil is actually being controlled by free market principals. For the most part, there has always been some kind of controls on the price of oil and that price has remained fairly constant when adjusted for inflation. \n \n The most recent control has been int eh hands of OPEC. Today, Opecs price point for oil is $50-$55. That is the inflation adjusted cost of oil...really no more expensive than past oil when adjusted for inflation (in fact, the cost of oil calculated in Euros was actually LOWER than the 10 yr average until oil topped $59).\n \n We have blown past that target price, and many people see no end in sight. The problem is that everybody is producing flat out, and the supply/demand curve is still very tight. A relatively minor disruption such as further shortages from Nigeria or a small decline from Iran would cross the supply an demand lines, at which point there is simply not enough oil to go around, and then things get really nasty.\n \n This is not a situation that is likely to get better, and may well get worse. We are facing decreased production from Cantrell (Mexico) Burgan (Kuwait) and Saudi Arabia (despite the fact that they assure us that they have all the oil in the world) this year. There is some new stuff coming on line, but nowhere near enough to make up those shortages. \n \n Demand is fully expected to increase by 2.5% this year. Even the best case scenario has it increasing by 2%, largely due to demand increases in China, India, and the United States (China and India use it for production, in the US, we just like the smell of smog and compensate for unsatisfying lives by driving 8000 lb SUVs to the grocery store to pick up milk). \n \n Will the supply and demand curves cross this year? Nobody knows. Too close to call. If we reduced output from Iran or Nigeria, then almost certainly YES. \n \n This seems to be similar to the dollar as a reserve currency issue I posted about last night. Everybody seems to be sitting around waiting for somebody to blink. Public oil officials have gotten VERY careful about what they say because the know very well that the wrong word at this point could send oil over $100 per barrel in an afternoon. \n \n We may well be seeing the beginning of peak oil problems.
