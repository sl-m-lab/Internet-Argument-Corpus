   "Where to start. So it is Bryer's interpretation that this was a monarchy, in which Madison was the only voice that counted. \n \n From our National Archives. \n  The Bill Of Rights ~ The First Ten Amendments to the Constitution \n Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, the right to a fair and speedy trial&#8211;the ringing phrases that inventory some of Americans' most treasured personal freedoms&#8211;were not initially part of the U.S. Constitution. At the Constitutional Convention, the proposal to include a bill of rights was considered and defeated. The Bill of Rights was added to the Constitution as the first ten amendments on December 15, 1791.\n \n The fact that the Constitution did not include a bill of rights to specifically protect Americans' hard-won rights sparked the most heated debates during the ratification process. To the Federalists, those who favored the Constitution, a bill of rights was unnecessary because the Federal Government was limited in its powers and could not interfere with the rights of the people or the states; also, most states had bills of rights. To the Anti-Federalists, those who opposed the Constitution, the prospect of establishing a strong central government without an explicit list of rights guaranteed to the people was unthinkable. Throughout the ratification process, individuals and state ratification conventions called for the adoption of a bill of rights.\n\n I don't think our Founders realized that Madison's views were the only ones that counted Mr. Bryer. \n  How the 2nd Amendment came to be. \n His first step was to obtain a pamphlet which conveniently listed all state proposals. The problem became one of editing; out of hundreds of proposals. Madison's decision to include a right to arms in his federal bill of rights is hardly surprising. Such a right had been demanded in virtually every call for a bill of rights; indeed, it had received twice the number of demands accorded freedom of speech. Language praising the militia had received much less support, essentially having been appended to the right to arms clause in Virginia and the two following conventions. But an adaptation of the Virginia/New York/North Carolina wording combining the two held unusual promise. One of Madison's major objectives was to \"bring in\" North Carolina.[240] He hoped to convince it to ratify the Constitution by offering an acceptable bill of rights. North Carolina could hardly object to a nearly verbatim acceptance of its demand.\n\n Well that is a bit different than Mr. Bryer's opinion too! \n \n And Bryer's statements totally ignore this truth. \n  Their philosophy of Rights can be found in the writings \n (1) The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution does not establish the right to keep and bear arms. None of the provisions of the Constitution establish any \"natural\" rights. They recognize such rights, but the repeal of such provisions would not end such rights. Such rights were considered by many of the Framers as obvious or \"self-evident\", but they were immersed in the prevailing republican thought of the day, as expressed in the writings of Locke, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Madison, Hamilton, and others, which discussed \"natural rights\" in some detail. Others argued that at least some of the rights needed to be made explicit in the Bill of Rights to avoid having future generations with less understanding of republican theory weaken in their defense of those rights. That has turned out to have been a good idea.\n \n (2) The right to keep and bear arms is a natural right of individuals under the theory of democratic government. This was clearly the understanding and intent of the Framers of the U.S. Constitution and was a long-established principle of English common law at the time the Constitution was adopted, which is considered to be a part of constitutional law for purposes of interpreting the written Constitution.\n\n Bryer's comments were a total misrepresentation that any school boy could have corrected!!!! That is, if they still teach this stuff in our schools.",

   " Breyer: Madison wrote 2nd Amendment to appease the states \n The founders didn't envision government on any level being able to utterly secure public safety, not even in the cities. Families needed guns for self-defense, and not just on the frontier from animals and hostile Native Americans and French and Spanish explorers, either. Then, as now, if families waited for the local constabulary to protect them from thieves and marauders, they'd find themselves either dead or homeless in short order.\n \n Madison also considered the right to bear arms an important check on federal power, too, and didn't reluctantly come to that position to appease the states into signing the Constitution. All Breyer needed to do to discover this was actually read Madison on the subject in Federalist 46, where Madison makes clear the role of states and men at arms in keeping the central government from overwhelming their sovereignty, emphases mine:\n \n That doesn't sound at all like a man who had to reluctantly guarantee that Americans would have those arms at hand in the extremity of need. Indeed, Madison makes his case poetically clear that the individual liberties the Constitution guaranteed against federal incursion were in fact guaranteed by the Second Amendment. Breyer's argument is fanciful at best, and self-serving to an inordinate degree.\n \n \n Is Breyer now saying that judges, including the Supreme Court, can ignore rights specifically guaranteed in the Constitution based upon the motivation for their inclusion? That judges can decide explicit rights don't exist because they weren't included in good faith? Wow.\n\n\n Madison also wrote.\n  9th Amendment \n The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. \n\n They are ALL our Rights, Steve, All of them!\n \n  Why Breyer is Wrong  \n \n  Justice Breyer's remarks on guns revisionist thinking \n \n  Breyer Suggests Second Amendment Out of Date ",

   "I'm really surprised to see you again so soon Galileo. Looking over your previous posts and the timestamps included on them, you usually go long periods of time between posts. Has something changed?\n \n Now that the introductions are over with we can get down to the meat and bones of the issue.\n \n \n\"Breyer wrote the dissent and was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. He said historians would side with him in the case because they have concluded that Founding Father James Madison was more worried that the Constitution may not be ratified than he was about granting individuals the right to bear arms. \n \n \"Madison 'was worried about opponents who would think Congress would call up state militias and nationalize them. \"That can't happen,\" said Madison,' said Breyer, adding that historians characterize Madison's priority as, 'I've got to get this document ratified.' \"\n\n \n You cite Breyer and his opinion. As you've already admitted in your post Breyer was a dissenting judge in the Heller case. By being a dissenting judge that means his opinion carries no legal weight and is a moot point. This means that you're holding up the loser as your current champion.\n \n Looking back over your previous posts I found this and I feel it's relevant:\n \n \nSupreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer:\n \n \"Chicago says that their gun law has saved hundreds, including -- and they have statistics -- lots of women in domestic cases,\" Breyer said. \"When you have the First Amendment, or some of the other amendments, there is always a big area where it's free speech versus a whole lot of things, but not often free speech versus life. When it's free speech versus life, we very often decide in favor of life.\"\n \n So even if the Chicago handgun ban does violate a Constitutional right it could still be justifiable.\n\n \n Here Stephen Breyer gave another opinion. That opinion was basically claiming that a constitutional right can be ruled moot in the name of promoting one group's opinion of what they consider \"public safety\". But the standard of \"public safety\" is open to interpretation over time and from one group to another, so it's very dangerous to take one group's interpretation of an intangible standard and make that the norm. It's even more dangerous to accept one group's opinion that their definition of a standard should be seen as more important than the integrity of the Constitution itself.\n \n Another post of yours from a while back that seemed relevant is this one. I'm bolding the part in question to show emphasis.\n \n \nSomeone who disagrees with a Supreme Court decision is not necessarily wrong. The Supreme Court has been wrong before so they could be wrong again. Justice Scalia of the Supreme Court has expressed his disagreement with Roe v. Wade, another Supreme Court ruling. If that decision hasn't shut down the intellectual debate on the constitutionality of abortion laws then there's no reason Heller should shut down the intellectual debate on the meaning of the Second Amendment.\n\n \n In the context of this post you were arguing against the Heller ruling, stating that in previous rulings the justices cast the wrong ruling, which in your mind lends credibility to the possibility that they were wrong when they ruled on Heller.\n \n So if the ruling on Heller was wrong, why is Stephen Breyer suddenly considered to possibly be right?\n \n I've also noted in the past that you've had absolutely no problem citing the portion of Heller that talks about longstanding prohibitions, such as the ones that apply to schools, felons and so-called \"sensitive locations\". Now if Heller is wrong, why is this portion right as far as you're concerned?\n \n \n\"The Court's opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.\"\n (D.C. v. Heller)\n \n Notice how someone can claim a court ruling as a victory for their own position but at the same time have a radical agenda at odds with that ruling. A chilling example of Orwellian doublethink....\n\n \n You regard this one paragraph as if it's a major victory for the gun control movement. And yet it comes from the court ruling that you've continually claimed is wrong and shouldn't be taken seriously. That's highly paradoxical and questionable of you.\n \n \nI don't think I agree with this. As I understand, Article 1 granted Congress the power to nationalize the militia during national emergencies such as when the British invaded America in the War of 1812. I don't think the Second Amendment changed that. I think the motivation for writing the Second Amendment had more to do with fears that the militia would be neglected by the federal government, that the federal government would fail to arm the militia and thus leave it in a state of being unarmed as Patrick Henry worried would happen.\n\n \n Is this what you truly think? Or is this one of the many positions you've basically adopted as your own, coming from varying sources of questionable authority and integrity?\n \n \nBreyer says that his own judicial philosophy consists of applying the unwavering values of the Founding Fathers to modern day circumstances. He says that according to such a philosophy, the former D.C. handgun ban was justifiable:\n \n \"Since the Founding Fathers could not foresee the impact of modern day communications and technology, the only option is to take the values of the Founding Fathers and apply them to today's challenges.\n\n \n I disagree, both with you and with Breyer. Constitutional law isn't my strong suit. But I know enough about it to know that a complete and total ban on a legal product is never justifiable. A complete and total ban on books would never be justifiable under any measure, there's no reason to assume that such a ban would be allowed by the Founding Fathers when it came to handguns.\n \n Keep in mind that in the original English Bill of Rights, the keep and bear arms provision was discriminatory in nature and applied only to members of a sanctioned religion.\n \n And then we come to the Militia Act of 1792. This piece of legislation specifically required people to own and possess their own handguns and to assemble with them in their possession when called upon. I kind of see this as contradictory to Breyer's position, which you are accepting as your own position.\n \n I really don't see what ground you have for claiming that the Bill of Rights, and the Founding Fathers who wrote it for the purpose of protecting the citizens, would ever allow the government to enact sweeping and total bans that were absolute in nature. It makes no sense at all. That would be akin to saying that the Founding Fathers never intended for anybody to have the ability to seek redress for grievances from the government. It's like saying dissenting opinions weren't allowed and only sanctioned speech and opinions were to be protected.\n \n \n\" 'The difficult job in open cases where there is no clear answer is to take those values in this document, which all Americans hold, which do not change, and to apply them to a world that is ever changing,' Breyer said. 'It's not a matter of policy. It is a matter of what those framers intended.'\n \n \"He suggested that those values and intentions mean that the Second Amendment allows for restrictions on the individual, including an all-out ban on handguns in the nation's capital.\"\n\n \n Well fortunately for all Americans, Breyer's opinion was relegated to the dissenters who have no legal weight. Stephen Breyer's mentality is dangerous to the Constitution and this nation. There are ways his logic is harmful that I can't even put into words at this point in time.\n \n How exactly can you comfortably put forth this opinion, basically adopting it as your own position on the matter?",

They were just saying what they had to say to get the states to approve the constitution. So to understand the second amendment you have to understand what they really meant when they wrote it.\n\n \n I am not a lawyer. I'm not an expert on constitutional law or authority. I'm not an expert historian with a degree from Harvard. But I do have an idea of what common sense is currently and was then.\n \n The English Bill of Rights, when it came to the keep and bear arms provision, says \"That the subjects which are Protestants may have arms for their defense suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law.\"\n \n So even in the English Bill of Rights, which was supposed to be a protection for the citizenry, it refers to the people as subjects, and specifies that only members of the state sanctioned religion have any right to be armed. Our Founding Fathers rebelled against England and all it stood for. I'm pretty sure that they had the intention of doing things better than England did. It's for reasons like that, that I believe they intended for the right to keep and bear arms to be taken very seriously.\n \n Also keep in mind that by the time of the ratification of the US Constitution, the most of recognized states/colonies each had their own individual state constitution, and they had their own keep and bear arms provisions. Let's take a look at them shall we?\n \n Delaware:\n A person has the right to keep and bear arms for the defense of self, family, home and State, and for hunting and recreational use.\n \n Pennsylvania:\n The right of the citizens to bear arms in defense of themselves and the State shall not be questioned.\n \n New Jersey:\n Absent\n \n Georgia:\n The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed, but the General Assembly shall have power to prescribe the manner in which arms may be borne.\n \n Connecticut:\n Every citizen has a right to bear arms in defense of himself and the state.\n \n Massachusetts:\n The people have a right to keep and to bear arms for the common defence. And as, in time of peace, armies are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be maintained without the consent of the legislature; and the military power shall always be held in an exact subordination to the civil authority, and be governed by it\n \n Maryland:\n Absent\n \n South Carolina:\n A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. As, in times of peace, armies are dangerous to liberty, they shall not be maintained without the consent of the General Assembly. The military power of the State shall always be held in subordination to the civil authority and be governed by it.\n \n New Hampshire:\n All persons have the right to keep and bear arms in defense of themselves, their families, their property and the state.\n \n Vermont:\n That the people have a right to bear arms for the defence of themselves and the State -- and as standing armies in time of peace are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be kept up; and that the military should be kept under strict subordination to and governed by the civil power.\n \n New York:\n Absent\n \n North Carolina:\n A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; and, as standing armies in time of peace are dangerous to liberty, they shall not be maintained, and the military shall be kept under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power. Nothing herein shall justify the practice of carrying concealed weapons, or prevent the General Assembly from enacting penal statutes against that practice.\n \n Rhode Island:\n The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\n \n So of the original 13 colonies that made the US Constitution possible, ten of them had keep and bear arms provisions; a good number of them made it clear that they took them very seriously, what with standards such as \"shall not be questioned.\" I highly doubt that the Founding Fathers \"didn't intend the right to keep and bear arms to be taken seriously\" with such provisions found in the state constitutions.",

Breyer did not write \"the\" dissent in Heller. Stevens wrote the first dissent (joined by Breyer, Ginsberg, and Souter), and Breyer wrote the second dissent (joined by Stevens, Ginsberg, and Souter). Breyer's dissent never once mentions Madison. Stevens wrote the dissent that mentions Madison and attempts to divine his hidden intentions. \n \n In Heller, Stevens guesses at a hidden agenda for Madison. His argument, summarized by himself, is as follows:\n \n The Second Amendment was adopted to protect the right of the people of each of the several States to maintain a well-regulated militia. It was a response to concerns raised during the ratification of the Constitution that the power of Congress to disarm the state militias and create a national standing army posed an intolerable [Slip Op. 2] threat to the sovereignty of the several States. Neither the text of the Amendment nor the arguments advanced by its proponents evidenced the slightest interest in limiting any legislature's authority to regulate private civilian uses of firearms. Specifically, there is no indication that the Framers of the Amendment intended to enshrine the common-law right of self-defense in the Constitution.District Of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 1-2 (2008) (Stevens, dissenting)\n \n And\n \n When each word in the text is given full effect, the Amendment is most naturally read to secure to the people a right to use and possess arms in conjunction with service in a well-regulated militia.District Of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 16 (2008) (Stevens, dissenting)\n \n Stevens argues the only purpose of the amendment is:\n \n to protect against congressional disarmament, by whatever means, of the States' militias. District Of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 26 (2008) (Stevens, dissenting)\n \n Regarding Madison, Stevens summarized his position as follows:\n \n When Madison prepared his first draft, and when that draft was debated and modified, it is reasonable to assume that all participants in the drafting process were fully aware of the other formulations that would have protected civilian use and possession of weapons and that their choice to craft the Amendment as they did represented a rejection of those alternative formulations. District Of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 25 (2008) (Stevens, dissenting) (emphasis added by me)\n \n Notably, Stevens offers no evidence of any statement attributable to Madison that supports this assumption....\n \n But having said all this, it is possible for Breyer to claim historians will agree with \"him\" instead of Stevens. Breyer joined Stevens' opinion, and when you do so you are telling the world \"I agree with everything he said\"-unless you write your own opinion explaining your differences. And this is where Breyer's own dissent shows that he was hedging his bets. Stevens went \"all in\" for the argument that the only purpose of the 2nd. Amendment was to protect the state militias from the federal disarmament. Breyer chose instead to ride the fence and suggest the Amendment has a dual purpose: \n \n I shall, as I said, assume with the majority that the Amendment, in addition to furthering a militia-related purpose, also furthers an interest in possessing guns for purposes of self-defense, at least to some degree. And I shall then ask whether the Amendment nevertheless permits the District handgun restriction at issue here.\n \n Although I adopt for present purposes the majority's position that the Second Amendment embodies a general concern about self-defense, I shall not assume that the Amendment contains a specific untouchable right to keep guns in the house to shoot burglars.  District Of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 3 (2008) (Breyer, dissenting)\n \n And so you see Breyer wanting to agree with Scalia on the standard individual right view \"at least to some degree,\" yet wanting at the same time to cling to Stevens' argument about the non-disarmament militia-protecting goal of the Amendment. In my opinion Breyer could care less whether it is an individual right or not so long as it does not hinder government attempts to heavily regulate it-and sitting on the fence with a primary/secondary dual purpose argument of his accomplishes this goal very well for him. In fact, you see it again in McDonald:\n \n First, as I have noted earlier in this opinion, and JUSTICE STEVENS argued in dissent, the history discussed in Heller shows that the Second Amendment was enacted primarily for the purpose of protecting militia-related rights.McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U.S. ___ 081521, 21 (2010) (Breyer, dissenting) (emphasis added by me)\n \n See where he is saying the \"primary\" and not the \"only\" purpose? He leaves open his argument that the 2nd, Amendment also protects \"to a lesser degree\" the individual citizen's arms. And he explained further about why he feels the secondary purpose is not strong enough to require incorporation against state infringement:\n \n Thus, the specific question before us is not whether there are references to the right to bear arms for self-defense throughout this Nation's history - of course there are - or even whether the Court should incorporate a simple constitutional requirement that firearms regulations not unreasonably burden the right to keep and bear arms, but rather whether there is a consensus that so substantial a private self-defense right as the one described in Heller applies to the States. McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U.S. ___ 081521, 20 (2010) (Breyer, dissenting) (emphasis in original)\n \n And so you see how carefully Breyer chooses his words. Even in the article cited from Fox he says Madison was \"more worried\" about securing passage than recognizing an individual RKBA-but he does not close the door on the individual right unconnected with the militia. He still leaves the dual track open-Madison did, in his opinion, have a secondary purpose of protecting the individual RKBA. And this suits him fine, for as long as he can pretend (again without offering evidence for the position) that Madison is relatively unconcerned about the individual RKBA, then he believes he can use his \"whatever the judge thinks is best\" test from Heller to protect all the gun restrictions he chooses-sort of like throwing a party for his high school friends when his parents are out of town and telling them he is free to decide how badly they can tear up the carpet in the basement during the party because the parents weren't that worried about it to begin with.\n \n But Stevens, although having the more honest argument, has his own problem which he avoids because he has no answer for it. Yet the want of an answer to this problem explodes his argument. The problem, in a nutshell, is that the 2nd. Amendment is wholly inadequate to perform the sole function Stevens assumes Madison must have had in mind.\n \n Stevens tells us the sole purpose of the Amendment was \"to protect against congressional disarmament, by whatever means, of the States' militias.\" Notice, however, that he never explained how the Amendment would do this in light the Congressional Power over the militias in Article I Section 8 (Breyer likewise has studiously avoided addressing this issue). In that article, Congress has the power:\n \n To provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions;\n \n To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, reserving to the states respectively, the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.\n \n Here is where I agree with your, Galileo:\n \n Congress has the power, substantial in itself, to \"call forth\" the militias and take them beyond the control of the states. In other words, assuming the 2nd. Amendment protects the right to have an armed militia or to carry arms in the militia, Congress can assume total control over that armed body and grant that control to the President (See Article II section 2). Nothing in the 2nd. Amendment repeals this power or in any way modifies it. The safeguard against this nationalization power is not found in the 2nd. Amendment, but in Article I section 8 itself-the exclusive reservation of power to the states to appoint the militia officers. This power was deemed sufficient to keep the militia's leaders loyal enough to the state's interests so that if the militia were ever nationalized its leaders would resist attempts to use the militia to injure the states or oppress its citizens. But set this aside for a moment, Galileo, for there is an even larger hurdle Stevens cannot get over.\n \n Here is where I disagree with you, Galileo:\n \n Assume you are correct when you argue \"the motivation for writing the Second Amendment had more to do with fears that the militia would be neglected by the federal government, that the federal government would fail to arm the militia and thus leave it in a state of being unarmed as Patrick Henry worried would happen.\" My answer is this: \n \n Congress has the power-and under the Article VI supremacy clause, it wields that power exclusively-to organize, arm, and discipline the militias. The states are forbidden to do any of these things without Congressional consent. \n \n How does the 2nd. Amendment protect the militias against this power? Neither Stevens nor Breyer can explain this. Neither can, for example, show how the 2nd. Amendment was intended to amend Article I Section 8 to make disarmament impossible. If the Amendment was intended to repeal or modify Congressional power to arm (and thus disarm) the militias, then the 2nd. Amendment is very poorly worded to suit that purpose. And, if there is no hidden agenda-if Madison is only doing what the states demand-then he has no reason not to be very plain and concise. He could and should have simply said the states have a concurrent power to arm their militias if Congress fails to exercise its power to do so. And yet he didn't. But looking further, if-as Stevens argues-the Amendment only protects the state's militias against congressional disarmament, then what use is this protection if Congress also retains the unilateral power to choose who will be and who will not be a member of the militia-when Congress can deliberately set its size so ridiculously small that protecting their right to carry arms in this small body of men is hopelessly inadequate to protect the state's interests? \n \n And so I argue that if the Amendment was intended only to protect the militia from virtual disarmament and impotency by congressional neglect, then the Amendment is very poorly written and wholly inadequate to this purpose. It is no wonder that not a single founder (including Madison) could be found to have said the 2nd. Amendment means what Stevens claims-forcing Stevens, for want of direct evidence, to merely \"assume\" it must be so-all the while carefully avoiding the direct statements from our founders that show the amendment recognizes an individual right unconnected with militia service.\n \n This, then, is the problem with the Stevens unilateral purpose argument-and I think this is why Breyer does not rely upon Stevens entirely. I believe that Breyer hedges his bets to admit an individual right exists in the 2nd. Amendment to distract us away from the problem with Stevens' argument (and Breyer still does not explain how the Amendment achieves the \"primary\" purpose of protecting against Congressional disarmament). His method is then to back-fill this individual right escape hatch from Stevens' predicament full of \"not really that important\" phrases that he feels liberates him to rule like a Caesar, giving a thumbs up or thumbs down on infringement legislation with no more guidance than his own personal whims-yeah, there is a individual right hidden in there, but since it wasn't that important to the founders (as he believes) then he should not bound by any constraints beyond his own conscience; and it's OK for him to decide what to do with this secondary, incidental right entirely on his own. \n \n So this is my opinion of the positions of Stevens and Breyer. The remaining two Heller dissenters (Ginsberg and Souter) chose to merely \"ditto\" Stevens and Breyer-which was a good call on their behalf. If either had written their own opinion then they would have had to explain an earlier contradictory comment. For Ginsberg has previously written an opinion-joined by Souter-in which both dissented from a majority opinion written (ironically) by Breyer. In that earlier dissent Ginsberg makes reference to the 2nd. Amendment that read as follows (note particularly how Ginsberg belittles Breyer's inadequate research methods):\n \n Unlike the Court, I do not think dictionaries,2 surveys of press reports,3 or the Bible4 tell us, dispositively, what \"carries\" [Page 143] means embedded in \u00a7 924(c)(1). On definitions, \"carry\" in legal formulations could mean, inter alia, transport, possess, have in stock, prolong (carry over), be infectious, or wear or bear on one's person.5 At issue here is not \"carries\" at large but \"carries a firearm.\" The Court's computer search of newspapers is revealing in this light. Carrying guns in a car showed up as the meaning \"perhaps more than one-third\" of the time. Ante, at 129. One is left to wonder what meaning showed up some two-thirds of the time. Surely a most familiar meaning is, as the Constitution's Second Amendment (\"keep and bear Arms\") (emphasis added) and Black's Law Dictionary, at 214, indicate: \"wear, bear, or carry . . . upon the person or in the clothing or in a pocket, for the purpose . . . of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive action in a case of conflict with another person.\" Muscarello v. United States, 524 U.S. 125, 142-143 (1998) (Ginsberg, dissenting) (emphasis in the original)",

   "The Fox news article has some facts wrong. Breyer did not write &#8220;the&#8221; dissent in Heller. Stevens wrote the first dissent (joined by Breyer, Ginsberg, and Souter), and Breyer wrote the second dissent (joined by Stevens, Ginsberg, and Souter). Breyer&#8217;s dissent never once mentions Madison. Stevens wrote the dissent that mentions Madison and attempts to divine his hidden intentions. \n \n In Heller, Stevens guesses at a hidden agenda for Madison. His argument, summarized by himself, is as follows:\n \n The Second Amendment was adopted to protect the right of the people of each of the several States to maintain a well-regulated militia. It was a response to concerns raised during the ratification of the Constitution that the power of Congress to disarm the state militias and create a national standing army posed an intolerable [Slip Op. 2] threat to the sovereignty of the several States. Neither the text of the Amendment nor the arguments advanced by its proponents evidenced the slightest interest in limiting any legislature's authority to regulate private civilian uses of firearms. Specifically, there is no indication that the Framers of the Amendment intended to enshrine the common-law right of self-defense in the Constitution.District Of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 1-2 (2008) (Stevens, dissenting)\n \n And\n \n When each word in the text is given full effect, the Amendment is most naturally read to secure to the people a right to use and possess arms in conjunction with service in a well-regulated militia.District Of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 16 (2008) (Stevens, dissenting)\n \n Stevens argues the only purpose of the amendment is:\n \n to protect against congressional disarmament, by whatever means, of the States' militias. District Of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 26 (2008) (Stevens, dissenting)\n \n Regarding Madison, Stevens summarized his position as follows:\n \n When Madison prepared his first draft, and when that draft was debated and modified, it is reasonable to assume that all participants in the drafting process were fully aware of the other formulations that would have protected civilian use and possession of weapons and that their choice to craft the Amendment as they did represented a rejection of those alternative formulations. District Of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 25 (2008) (Stevens, dissenting) (emphasis added by me)\n \n Notably, Stevens offers no evidence of any statement attributable to Madison that supports this assumption&#8230;.\n \n But having said all this, it is possible for Breyer to claim historians will agree with &#8220;him&#8221; instead of Stevens. Breyer joined Stevens&#8217; opinion, and when you do so you are telling the world &#8220;I agree with everything he said&#8221;&#8212;unless you write your own opinion explaining your differences. And this is where Breyer&#8217;s own dissent shows that he was hedging his bets. Stevens went &#8220;all in&#8221; for the argument that the only purpose of the 2nd. Amendment was to protect the state militias from the federal disarmament. Breyer chose instead to ride the fence and suggest the Amendment has a dual purpose: \n \n I shall, as I said, assume with the majority that the Amendment, in addition to furthering a militia-related purpose, also furthers an interest in possessing guns for purposes of self-defense, at least to some degree. And I shall then ask whether the Amendment nevertheless permits the District handgun restriction at issue here.\n \n Although I adopt for present purposes the majority's position that the Second Amendment embodies a general concern about self-defense, I shall not assume that the Amendment contains a specific untouchable right to keep guns in the house to shoot burglars.  District Of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 3 (2008) (Breyer, dissenting)\n \n And so you see Breyer wanting to agree with Scalia on the standard individual right view &#8220;at least to some degree,&#8221; yet wanting at the same time to cling to Stevens&#8217; argument about the non-disarmament militia-protecting goal of the Amendment. In my opinion Breyer could care less whether it is an individual right or not so long as it does not hinder government attempts to heavily regulate it&#8212;and sitting on the fence with a primary/secondary dual purpose argument of his accomplishes this goal very well for him. In fact, you see it again in McDonald:\n \n First, as I have noted earlier in this opinion, and JUSTICE STEVENS argued in dissent, the history discussed in Heller shows that the Second Amendment was enacted primarily for the purpose of protecting militia-related rights.McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U.S. ___ 081521, 21 (2010) (Breyer, dissenting) (emphasis added by me)\n \n See where he is saying the &#8220;primary&#8221; and not the &#8220;only&#8221; purpose? He leaves open his argument that the 2nd, Amendment also protects &#8220;to a lesser degree&#8221; the individual citizen&#8217;s arms. And he explained further about why he feels the secondary purpose is not strong enough to require incorporation against state infringement:\n \n Thus, the specific question before us is not whether there are references to the right to bear arms for self-defense throughout this Nation's history &#8212; of course there are &#8212; or even whether the Court should incorporate a simple constitutional requirement that firearms regulations not unreasonably burden the right to keep and bear arms, but rather whether there is a consensus that so substantial a private self-defense right as the one described in Heller applies to the States. McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U.S. ___ 081521, 20 (2010) (Breyer, dissenting) (emphasis in original)\n \n And so you see how carefully Breyer chooses his words. Even in the article cited from Fox he says Madison was &#8220;more worried&#8221; about securing passage than recognizing an individual RKBA&#8212;but he does not close the door on the individual right unconnected with the militia. He still leaves the dual track open&#8212;Madison did, in his opinion, have a secondary purpose of protecting the individual RKBA. And this suits him fine, for as long as he can pretend (again without offering evidence for the position) that Madison is relatively unconcerned about the individual RKBA, then he believes he can use his &#8220;whatever the judge thinks is best&#8221; test from Heller to protect all the gun restrictions he chooses&#8212;sort of like throwing a party for his high school friends when his parents are out of town and telling them he is free to decide how badly they can tear up the carpet in the basement during the party because the parents weren&#8217;t that worried about it to begin with.\n \n But Stevens, although having the more honest argument, has his own problem which he avoids because he has no answer for it. Yet the want of an answer to this problem explodes his argument. The problem, in a nutshell, is that the 2nd.

United States, 524 U.S. 125, 142-143 (1998) (Ginsberg, dissenting) (emphasis in the original)\n\n I believe the motivation for including the Second Amendment in the Bill of Rights was this fear, expressed by George Mason:\n \"Should the national government wish to render the militia useless, they may neglect them, and let them perish, in order to have a pretence of establishing a standing army.\"\n \n He explains:\n \"What havoc, desolation, and destruction, have been perpetrated by standing armies! An instance within the memory of some of this house will show us how our militia may be destroyed. Forty years ago, when the resolution of enslaving America was formed in Great Britain, the British Parliament was advised by an artful man,* who was governor of Pennsylvania, to disarm the people; that it was the best and most effectual way to enslave them; but that they should not do it openly, but weaken them, and let them sink gradually, by totally disusing and neglecting the militia.\"\n \n Anti-federalists had also worried that the federal government would try to make militia service as unpleasant as possible so that no would want to participate in the militia:\n \"They may effect the destruction of the militia, by rendering the service odious to the people themselves, by harassing them from one end of the continent to the other, and by keeping them under martial law.\"\n \n So I don't think the fear was so much that the government would go from door to door collecting people's guns. The fear was that the people would be disarmed by government neglect of the militia. As the founders understood it, government had to take a proactive role in passing and enforcing militia regulations in order to keep the people well armed and militarily prepared. Fearing federal neglect of the militia, both Henry and Mason wanted an explicit recognition of a state power to arm the militia in the Constitution. Madison's response was that there was nothing in the Constitution that prohibited the states from arming their own militias and besides the states had neglected their own militias in the past:\n \"I cannot conceive that this Constitution, by giving the general government the power of arming the militia, takes it away from the state governments. The power is concurrent, and not exclusive. Have we not found, from experience, that, while the power of arming and governing the militia has been solely vested in the state legislatures, they were neglected and rendered unfit for immediate service? Every state neglected too much this most essential object.\"\n (quotes taken from Elliot's Debates --Saturday, June 14, 1788.)\n http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/hlawquery.html\n \n In the end, anti-federalists such as Mason and Henry did not get their way. Instead of recognizing a right of the states to arm the militia, the Second Amendment really represented a commitment by the federal government to not let the militia atrophy and become militarily ineffective due to neglect. The amendment did not take away from Congress' power over the militia as pointed out in a brief filed in Heller:\n \n \"The amendment, as revised, would still assauge Anti-Federalist concerns by stating a principled commitment to the value of a militia. But it would not hinder Congress in using its best judgement to determine how to organize, arm, and discipline an effective militia.\"\n http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/pdfs/07-08/07-290_PetitionerAmCuRakove.pdf\n \n A concern for owning a gun to defend one's home against a burglar, for example, did not seem to play much of a part in the controversy that surrounded the Second Amendment. Personal self-defense against crime was an area already covered by common law which originated in England and thus did not need to be addressed by statutory law.",

   "The Revolutionary War started when our founder's very own government, told their very own soldiers to go to both Lexington and Concorde to seize the Powder stores, collecting weapons along the way. (History Channel) \n \n What was our Founders reaction to this? What did they do to their very own government and soldiers when they tried to disarm them? They stuck their very own guns in their government and soldiers faces! But NOW we are to believe that our Founders did not fear being disarmed, and completely trusted the new government. Really?\n \n Riddle me this Batman! Why would Our Founders not ratify the new Constitution without specific guarantees that Congress would produce an acceptable Bill of Rights? Because they implicitly trusted the new government? Please! They wanted guarantees that Congress could not stick its nose into their Hard fought, and won, Freedoms! \n \n From our national Archives.\n   The Bill Of Rights ~ The First Ten Amendments to the Constitution \n The fact that the Constitution did not include a bill of rights to specifically protect Americans' hard-won rights sparked the most heated debates during the ratification process. To the Federalists, those who favored the Constitution, a bill of rights was unnecessary because the Federal Government was limited in its powers and could not interfere with the rights of the people or the states; also, most states had bills of rights. To the Anti-Federalists, those who opposed the Constitution, the prospect of establishing a strong central government without an explicit list of rights guaranteed to the people was unthinkable. Throughout the ratification process, individuals and state ratification conventions called for the adoption of a bill of rights.\n \n \n One of those explicit Rights was the Right to Keep and Bear Arms. 1791\n \n Now we move to the 14th Amendment! Ratified 1868 emoticon_smile You knew that was coming Right? \n \n   Institute for Justice -- 14th Amendment \n 2. The history and adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment demonstrates the Framer's specific and repeated concern that freedmen were being disarmed by state and local governments and militias, in violation of what those Framers understood to be an individual constitutional right to bear arms. In response to this Court's previous refusal to enforce parts of the Bill of Rights directly against the States, and its holding that blacks were not citizens of the United States entitled to the rights of such citizens, the Framers set out to remedy the inability to enforce numerous constitutional rights against the States by incorporating them into the Fourteenth Amendment. Identification of the evils the 39th Congress sought to remedy - including the disarming of freedmen - the parallel legislative responses to that problem, and the specific explanations by the Framers of the purpose and function of the Fourteenth Amendment, all demonstrate that they viewed the existing constitutional right to bear arms as an individual right of personal security. And they understood and intended the language of the Fourteenth Amendment to secure such a right against the States and various militias, not merely in the service of the very entities seeking to disarm and abuse the freedmen. And by accomplishing that goal through the identification and extension of the rights of national citizens, the Framers of the Fourteenth Amendment also clarified and defined the underlying rights in the Second Amendment as well.\n \n Whatever the basis for incorporation, however, the history of the Fourteenth Amendment shows that the right to bear arms was intended to be incorporated, and thus should be read as it was understood at the time of such incorporation. \n\n \n   The Second Amendment strikes back  \n Even some noted liberal professors admit the obvious. Harvard's Laurence Tribe says, \"The Fourteenth Amendment, which makes parts of the Bill of Rights applicable to the states, reflected a broad agreement that bearing arms was a 'privilege' of each citizen.\"  Fellow Harvard liberal law professor Alan Dershowitz agrees, and scolds fellow liberals for twisting the words of the Second Amendment in a way that could come back to haunt them. \"Foolish liberals who are trying to read the Second Amendment out of the Constitution by claiming that it's not an individual right or that it's too much of a safety hazard,\" said Dershowitz, \"don't see the danger of the big picture.\" He added, \"They're courting disaster by encouraging others to use the same means to eliminate portions of the Constitution they don't like.\" \n",

   "I believe the motivation for including the Second Amendment in the Bill of Rights was this fear, expressed by George Mason:\n \"Should the national government wish to render the militia useless, they may neglect them, and let them perish, in order to have a pretence of establishing a standing army.\"\n\n \n I believe you're wrong Galileo. As Bryan explained, the Second Amendment is too poorly worded to suggest that it was to be seen as a defense tool to prevent the federal government from using the authority of Article 1 Section 8 to disarm and dismiss the militia, and render them useless through formation of a nationalized standing army. I simply don't see any grounds for reading into the Second Amendment, a supposed safeguard against the federal government basically killing off the private forces of the states that made up the nation.\n \n The US Constitution was ratified on June 21, 1788. The Bill of Rights containing the Second Amendment was ratified on December 15, 1791. That's More than three years of difference. And during those 3+ years difference, the authority of Article 1 Section 8 is left in full, with no supposed protection from the Second Amendment, meaning that during those 3+ years of time the federal government had unrestrained authority to order all state militias to lay down their arms, and the state governments had no legal recourse.\n \n This is outright and utter nonsense however. Reading back over previous posts on this board there is ample amounts of evidence showing that other Amendments within the Bill of Rights recognized the mentioned rights as individual in nature, designed to protect the people against actions of the federal government. There's nothing I can see that would suggest the Bill of Rights was designed to protect the states from government interference and trespass on state matters. If you try and argue otherwise that would be saying that the Commerce Clause is wrong and the government has no authority to regulate activity that might affect interstate commerce.\n \n \nHe explains:\n \"What havoc, desolation, and destruction, have been perpetrated by standing armies! An instance within the memory of some of this house will show us how our militia may be destroyed. Forty years ago, when the resolution of enslaving America was formed in Great Britain, the British Parliament was advised by an artful man,* who was governor of Pennsylvania, to disarm the people; that it was the best and most effectual way to enslave them; but that they should not do it openly, but weaken them, and let them sink gradually, by totally disusing and neglecting the militia.\"\n\n \n Then why did it take over three years after the ratification of the Constitution to ratify the Bill of Rights and it's supposed protections of a state's right to maintain its own militias?\n \n In previous debates you've had with others you've argued that the Constitution protects no right to rebel against the government and usurp authority, or about how the Founding Fathers condemned rebellion (despite the fact that they rebelled to make America independent of British rule). But I feel this position you put forth is contradicted by your current position. If I remember correctly your current argument about the nature of the Second Amendment was that it's intention was to protect the authority of states to maintain militias in opposition to what the federal government claimed and saw fit to order. In essence your new position is that the Constitution DID protect a right to rebel against the government and usurp authority.\n \n Under this standard that would mean the Civil War was backwards, that the southern states had the right to secede from the union and maintain sovereignty and manage their own affairs as they saw fit without government interference.\n \n At least that's the way I'm reading it. The problem is that you've adopted so many positions by so many people and put them forward as if they were your own, nobody can truly keep track of the many arguments you've made. One source says one thing, another says something else.\n \n \nAnti-federalists had also worried that the federal government would try to make militia service as unpleasant as possible so that no would want to participate in the militia:\n \"They may effect the destruction of the militia, by rendering the service odious to the people themselves, by harassing them from one end of the continent to the other, and by keeping them under martial law.\"\n\n \n See above.\n \n \nSo I don't think the fear was so much that the government would go from door to door collecting people's guns. The fear was that the people would be disarmed by government neglect of the militia.\n\n \n I'm failing to see how exactly neglect of the militia would equate to disarming the people. The only way to do that would be to make service in the militia a mandatory requirement before a person was allowed to own their guns in the first place.\n \n \nAs the founders understood it, government had to take a proactive role in passing and enforcing militia regulations in order to keep the people well armed and militarily prepared.\n\n \n The same government that basically dissolved the militia by forming a national standing army, thus creating the same beast the Founding Fathers sought to avoid?\n \n \nFearing federal neglect of the militia, both Henry and Mason wanted an explicit recognition of a state power to arm the militia in the Constitution. Madison's response was that there was nothing in the Constitution that prohibited the states from arming their own militias and besides the states had neglected their own militias in the past:\n \"I cannot conceive that this Constitution, by giving the general government the power of arming the militia, takes it away from the state governments. The power is concurrent, and not exclusive. Have we not found, from experience, that, while the power of arming and governing the militia has been solely vested in the state legislatures, they were neglected and rendered unfit for immediate service? Every state neglected too much this most essential object.\"\n (quotes taken from Elliot's Debates --Saturday, June 14, 1788.)\n Search: A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation\n\n \n So instead of adding a clause to the Constitution to specify that the authority of the states to form, drill and maintain their own private militias in whatever manner they saw fit, Henry and Mason waited over three years before putting forth the Second Amendment in a poorly worded attempt to convey this supposed safeguard of sate authority and sovereignty against government mismanagement?\n \n \nA concern for owning a gun to defend one's home against a burglar, for example, did not seem to play much of a part in the controversy that surrounded the Second Amendment. Personal self-defense against crime was an area already covered by common law which originated in England and thus did not need to be addressed by statutory law.\n\n \n The Founding Father saw fit to implement a system of safeguards to protect an individual's right to be secure in their person and possession against unwarranted government intrusion. They also saw fit to prevent the government from establishing a national religion. They saw fit to allow the people to seek redress against the government for grievances. they saw fit to protect the people against excessive fines and cruel/unusual punishment. They even saw fit to prevent secret trials without juries. They saw fit to implement all of these and more within the Bill of Rights.\n \n Seeing all of these things implemented in the Bill of Rights, I have a hard time believing that the Founding Fathers chose to believe that self defense through use of arms didn't warrant constitutional protection as well. After all it's not in the interest of the government that members of its militia not be subjected to heavy fines for whatever reason, but the people still have that protection regardless.",

Instead of recognizing a right of the states to arm the militia, the Second Amendment really represented a commitment by the federal government to not let the militia atrophy and become militarily ineffective due to neglect. The amendment did not take away from Congress' power over the militia as pointed out in a brief filed in Heller:\n \n \"The amendment, as revised, would still assauge Anti-Federalist concerns by stating a principled commitment to the value of a militia. But it would not hinder Congress in using its best judgement to determine how to organize, arm, and discipline an effective militia.\"\n http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/pdfs/07-08/07-290_PetitionerAmCuRakove.pdf\n \n A concern for owning a gun to defend one's home against a burglar, for example, did not seem to play much of a part in the controversy that surrounded the Second Amendment. Personal self-defense against crime was an area already covered by common law which originated in England and thus did not need to be addressed by statutory law.\n\n \n Good Stuff, Galileo. \n \n Let&#8217;s start with Madison&#8217;s quote. This is a constitutional debate before the framing of the BoR, and he is dismissing the anti-federalist fear of neglect for a militia. He claims that if Congress refused to exercise the militia powers proposed in the Constitution then the states had the power to arm their militias. This, in my view, is correct. But it only addresses one side of the coin&#8212;what happens when Congress fails to act (to arm the militia, to organize the militia, etc). Nothing in the Constitution forbids state powers to act in a given area when Congress refuses to do so unless the Constitution specifically states otherwise, and Madison is pointing out that the militia clauses of Article I Section 8 that were the subject of this debate did not forbid state action. So when it says &#8220;Congress shall have the power&#8221; Madison is correctly pointing out this does not mean &#8220;the states do not have the power.&#8221; \n \n But what happens when the coin is turned over&#8212;when Congress does choose to act? This is where the Article VI &#8220;supremacy clause&#8221; takes control:\n \n This Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, any thing in the Constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.\n \n The effect of this clause is I think best explained by two fairly recent cases: \n \n The Federal Government holds a decided advantage in this delicate balance: the Supremacy Clause. U.S. Const., Art. VI. As long as it is acting within the powers granted it under the Constitution, Congress may impose its will on the States. Congress may legislate in areas traditionally regulated by the States. This is an extraordinary power in a federalist system. It is a power that we must assume Congress does not exercise lightly. Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 460 (1991):\n \n The Supremacy Clause of Art. VI of the Constitution provides Congress with the power to pre-empt state law. Pre-emption occurs when Congress, in enacting a federal statute, expresses a clear intent to pre-empt state law, Jones v. Rath Packing Co., 430 U.S. 519 (1977), when there is outright or actual conflict between federal and state law, e.g., Free v. Bland, 369 U.S. 663 (1962), where compliance with both federal and state law is in effect physically impossible, Florida Lime & Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373 U.S. 132 (1963), where there is implicit in federal law a barrier to state regulation, Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U.S. 85 (1983), where Congress has legislated comprehensively, thus occupying an entire field of regulation and leaving no room for the States to supplement federal law, Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.S. 218 (1947), or where the state law stands as [Page 369] an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full objectives of Congress. Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52 (1941). Pre-emption may result not only from action taken by Congress itself; a federal agency acting within the scope of its congressionally delegated authority may pre-empt state regulation. Fidelity Federal Savings & Loan Assn. v. De la Cuesta, 458 U.S. 141 (1982); Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp, 467 U.S. 691 (1984). Louisiana Public Service Comm'n v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 368-369 (1986)\n \n So&#8212;to put it plain and simple&#8212;if Congress chooses to act then its will is supreme and any state law that runs contrary to it is void. For example, if Congress refuses to act to arm the militias, then the states may do so. But if Congress acts to say they will be armed only with crossbows, then the states are powerless to act to arm them any differently. Say, for example, that Congress and the states both agree that an effective militia size (to protect the nation and alleviate the need for a standing army) is 10,000 men with 500 officers for each state. If Congress refuses to pass any law setting the size and composition of the militia then the states are free to pass laws that meet this target. But if Congress, because it is dominated by a tyrant or an oligarchy, decides to create a standing army as an instrument of oppression and then passes a law to say no state shall have a militia larger than 300 men (sorry, I&#8217;m a fan of ancient Greek history) with say 20 officers, then the only thing the states can do is choose who the officers can be. And if Congress chooses to act further, then it can individually pick and choose who the remaining &#8220;privates&#8221; will be. And if Congress then chooses to declare that the only weapon the 300 militia men could carry were nine foot spears, then the states are powerless to provide other arms. \n \n Does Stevens or Breyer suggest that Madison or any other founder did not understand the supremacy clause, or that they were too stupid to understand how it impacted the militias? No. The founders knew as well as we do that the combination of Article I section 8 and the supremacy clause meant the only arms beyond Congressional control were those kept in private hands. I argue that one goal of the 2nd. Amendment was to keep things this way. \n \n I agree with you that the individual RKBA was considered a right a common law. But these common law rights were not deemed sufficient protection by the Anti-federalists&#8230;.The common law only exists because states passed laws stating that it remains in full force and effect unless contravened by a state statute. Although we still call it the &#8220;Common Law,&#8221; once we broke with England it became state law enforced as the law that binds a state in state court. As such it is subject to the Constitution&#8217;s &#8220;supremacy clause&#8221; and federal law can override it (and has on many occasions). This was the whole point of the debate over enumerated powers and the need for a Bill of Rights. The Federalists argued the principle of government limited by enumerated powers&#8212;Congress could not abrogate these common law rights because it was not given the specific power to do so. But go back and read how broadly written the enumerated power are. There is a lot of room for mischief in the broad generalized language&#8212;and the Anti-federalists fears lived in those open spaces. Anti-federalists were not creating new rights out of whole cloth by demanding a Bill of Rights; they were demanding that these rights be protected from broadly worded congressional power by being recognized in the Constitution itself. They did so because they did not believe the enumerated powers were written narrowly enough to prevent abrogation of these rights. And they knew that if Congress passed a law infringing upon these rights that was later upheld as an act done within its enumerated powers then the supremacy clause would declare the legislation the victor over any claim to the common law right.\n \n \n And so I disagree that the founders believed it was sufficient to have these rights protected by only common law. We also had a common law right to petition the government for redress of grievances, to free press, speech, and religion&#8212;but these were included in the BoR to ensure that Article I section 8 and Article VI could not be used to override these important rights. The same goes for every other &#8220;right of the people&#8221; included in the BoR. \n \n The Second Amendment, in my opinion, very clearly states the militia preference principle (assuaging the fears expressed by Patrick Henry and others in the ratification debates), and then goes further. There is no evidence that Madison wanted to take away the Congressional power to impose uniformity over the militias and their arms. To do so would have invited the chaos of states having incompatible weapons that would have only lead to stronger calls for the need of a standardized professional army. What Madison did, in my opinion (and here I am speculating as much as Breyer and Stevens, but I believe I do so with far better evidence), is protect the arms held by the third rail of America&#8212;the people. The operative clause clearly announces that no congressional power is to be construed to extend to cover individual arms. It is, after all, the plain meaning of the words. \n \n To return to Stevens&#8217; and Breyer&#8217;s argument&#8230;.This narrow and strained interpretation of a sole purpose for the amendment, as the Heller majority pointed out, reduces the &#8220;right of the people&#8221; to nothing more than a &#8220;privilege&#8221; which can be revoked by the stroke of a congressional pen. Stevens&#8217; and Breyer&#8217;s inability to address the other side of the coin&#8212;when Congress passes a law and preempts state action by the supremacy clause&#8212;reduces their argument to nothing more than saying the amendment serves no real purpose at all&#8212;that both before and after the Amendment the states are free to build whatever sand castles they want to defend themselves until the Congressional bully comes by and kicks them all over. The Constitution gave Congress the ownership of the beach&#8212;the states are free to get sand their shorts as long as Congress looks the other way and does not yell out &#8220;you kids get off my property.&#8221;\n \n Nothing in the 2nd. Amendment changes this. The Rakove quote you referenced acknowledges this. And that leads us back to the heart of the issue&#8212;the actual wording of the amendment. Stevens and Breyer can speculate about intentions behind words all they want, but they still have to address the actual words. They do not (and cannot) take the necessary further step to show us how the actual words mean what they &#8220;assume&#8221; Madison and others intended. How many quotes about the actual wording of the amendment have they attributed to any person who drafted, considered, or debated its ratification? Not a single one. They cannot give us even a single sentence from a founder who says &#8220;this is what the words mean.&#8221; But they know such quotes exist&#8212;it&#8217;s just that they tell us the Amendment does two things: Restate the preference for the militia over a standing army, and secure to the individual citizens their right to have their own arms. \n \n Furthermore, neither Stevens nor Breyer has explained how the actual language of the Amendment can be twisted to meet their interpretation. Why can&#8217;t they do so? We are, after all, dealing with the words of the Amendment&#8212;and words mean what they say, don&#8217;t they? This has been a principle of how to read legal documents since before our nation&#8217;s founding. Here is just one quote to that effect: \n \n We have stated time and again that courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there. When the statutory language is plain, the sole function of the courts &#8212; at least where the disposition required by the text is not absurd &#8212; is to enforce it according to its terms.  Carr v. United States, 560 U.S. ___ 081301, 18 (June 1, 2010)\n \n I chose this one from many because this is a majority opinion written by Sotomayor, and joined by both Stevens and Breyer&#8212;and was published the same term (actually the same month) as the McDonald decision. \n \n And so I ask: What is ambiguous about the phrase &#8220;the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed&#8221;? How could Sotomayor, Stevens, and Breyer apply the above principle to the plain language of a statute in a case decided June 1, 2010 (Carr), only to abandon the same principle in a case interpreting the Constitution itself decided on June 28, 2010 (McDonald)?\n \n How can historians ever look back upon this and agree this was anything more than a raw exercise of Orwellian &#8220;doublethink&#8221; under the guise that the ends must justify the means?",

The first authorized federal criminal law enforcement is based on the Congressional power \"To provide for the punishment of counterfeiting the securities and current coin of the United States.\" The counterfeiting enforcement power immediately follows the delegation of Congressional power \"To coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin....\" U.S. Const., Art. I, sect. 8. \n The second Congressional criminal power involves the power \"To define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas, and offenses against the law of nations.\" The third is that \"Congress shall have Power to declare Punishment of Treason.\" Although currency, treason, and the high seas clearly involve areas of federal, and not state concern, it is notable that, even in those cases, the authors of the Constitution felt a need specifically to authorize Congressional law enforcement regarding these matters.\n \n In addition to the enumerated federal criminal powers, it is possible to infer some additional power. For example, Congress is given authority to declare uniform rules of bankruptcy; federal law does and should continue to punish bankruptcy fraud, even when perpetrated within a single state. Congressional power over federal property implies the authority to create penalties for destruction of federal property. \n \n While the body of the Constitution grants only narrow criminal law enforcement powers to the federal government, the Bill of Rights, in the Tenth Amendment, specifically reserves to the states all powers not granted to the federal government. - David Kopel\n \n \n \n The antis like to think if they can get a federal court to undo this contract the States will be bound to follow unConstitutional law.

Personal self-defense against crime was an area already covered by common law which originated in England and thus did not need to be addressed by statutory law.\n\n Well, if you are arguing in the cities, I suppose, you MIGHT get away with that argument.

Highwaymen I think they were called. \n \n And if that were not a concern, then why did they build forts with stockade fences around them? Were they not to keep dangerous animals and people out?",

It's not in my head, though. It's in my computer's research tools. \n \n Case in point-I did not know the answer to your question, but I knew where to look. The answer is Congress has passed laws allowing the states to have a state controlled \"defense force\" beyond the National Guard. To see this we have to look at a few statutes together. First, start with the statute that defines the guard: \n \n U.S. Code 32 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 (I'm only citing the definitions that apply:\n \n (3) \"National Guard\" means the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard.\n (4) \"Army National Guard\" means that part of the organized militia of the several States and Territories, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia, active and inactive, that -\n (A) is a land force;\n (B) is trained, and has its officers appointed, under the sixteenth clause of section 8, article I, of the Constitution;\n (C) is organized, armed, and equipped wholly or partly at Federal expense; and\n (D) is federally recognized.\n \n (6) \"Air National Guard\" means that part of the organized militia of the several States and Territories, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia, active and inactive, that -\n (A) is an air force;\n (B) is trained, and has its officers appointed, under the sixteenth clause of section 8, article I of the Constitution;\n (C) is organized, armed, and equipped wholly or partly at Federal expense; and\n (D) is federally recognized.\n \n This is what we traditionally call the guard-that body of state militia members who are subject to \"impressment\" into federal service under Congress' Article I section 8 power:\n \n To provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions\n \n But there is another statute that allows for a secondary state \"defense force\" that is exclusively controlled by the states and cannot be called into federal service. The statute in question limits the states to two armed bodies. 1. The national guard (as defined above) and 2. These State \"defense forces\":\n \n 32 U.S.C. \u00a7 109 - Maintenance of other troops\n \n (a) In time of peace, a State or Territory, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, or the District of Columbia may maintain no troops other than those of its National Guard and defense forces authorized by subsection (c).\n \n (b) Nothing in this title limits the right of a State or Territory, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, or the District of Columbia to use its National Guard or its defense forces authorized by subsection (c) within its borders in time of peace, or prevents it from organizing and maintaining police or constabulary.\n \n (c) In addition to its National Guard, if any, a State or Territory, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, or the District of Columbia may, as provided by its laws, organize and maintain defense forces. A defense force established under this section may be used within the jurisdiction concerned, as its chief executive (or commanding general in the case of the District of Columbia) considers necessary, but it may not be called, ordered, or drafted into the armed forces.\n \n (d) A member of a defense force established under subsection (c) is not, because of that membership, exempt from service in the armed forces, nor is he entitled to pay, allowances, subsistence, transportation, or medical care or treatment, from funds of the United States.\n \n (e) A person may not become a member of a defense force established under subsection (c) if he is a member of a reserve component of the armed forces.\n \n So currently (the above statute was passed in 1956) Congress allows the states to have the national guard \"militia\" and a separate state maintained/operated/controlled \"defense force\"-if the state wishes to create one. Note that these \"defense forces\" are limited by Congress to operating only within the territory of the state, and Congress has expressly refused to require that these forces may be \"federalized.\" I believe different states have dealt with this grant of power in different ways. \n \n As an example of a state defense force, consider my state of Virginia's defense force as established under the following Virginia code section (citing again only that portion that is relevant): \n \n \u00a7 44-54.4. Organization; definitions. - The Virginia State Defense Force with a targeted membership of at least 1,200 shall be organized within and subject to the control of the Department of Military Affairs.\n \n When called to state active duty, the mission of the Virginia State Defense Force shall be to (i) provide for an adequately trained organized reserve militia to assume control of Virginia National Guard facilities and to secure any federal and state property left in place in the event of the mobilization of the Virginia National Guard, (ii) assist in the mobilization of the Virginia National Guard, (iii) support the Virginia National Guard in providing family assistance to military dependents within the Commonwealth in the event of the mobilization of the Virginia National Guard, (iv) provide a military force to respond to the call of the Governor in those circumstances described in \u00a7 44-75.1\n \n See also Virginia code section 44-75.1 for other purposes for the defense force in my state:\n \n \u00a7 44-75.1. Militia state active duty. -\n \n A. The Governor or his designee may call forth the militia or any part thereof to state active duty for service in any of the following circumstances:\n \n 1. In the event of invasion or insurrection or imminent threat of either;\n \n 2. When any combination of persons becomes so powerful as to obstruct the execution of laws in any part of this Commonwealth;\n \n 3. When the Governor determines that a state agency or agencies having law-enforcement responsibilities are in need of assistance to perform particular law-enforcement functions, which functions he shall specify in his call to the militia;\n \n 4. In the event of flood, hurricane, fire or other forms of natural or man-made disaster wherein human life, public or private property, or the environment is imperiled;\n \n 5. In emergencies of lesser magnitude than those described in subdivision 4, including but not limited to the disruption of vital public services, wherein the use of militia personnel or equipment would be of assistance to one or more departments, agencies, institutions, or political subdivisions of the Commonwealth;\n \n 6. When the Governor determines that the National Guard and its assets would be of valuable assistance to state, local or federal agencies having a drug law-enforcement function to combat the flow of or use of illegal drugs in the Commonwealth, he may provide for the National Guard or any part thereof to support drug interdiction, counterdrug and demand reduction activities within the Commonwealth, or outside the Commonwealth under the National Guard Mutual Assistance Counterdrug Activities Compact. In calling forth the National Guard under this section, the Governor shall specify the type of support that the National Guard shall undertake with state, local or federal law-enforcement agencies. Once called forth by the Governor, the National Guard is also specifically authorized to enter into mutual assistance and support agreements with any law-enforcement agencies, state or federal, operating within or outside this Commonwealth so long as those activities are consistent with the Governor's call. All activities undertaken by the National Guard in the areas of drug interdiction, counterdrug and drug demand reduction shall be reported by the Adjutant General's office to the Governor and reviewed by the Governor no less frequently than every three months; and\n \n 7. When the Governor or his designee, in consultation with the Adjutant General, determines that the militia or any part thereof is in need of specific training to be prepared for being called forth for any of the circumstances expressed in subdivisions 1 through 6 above. Such training may be conducted with a state or federal agency or agencies having the capability or responsibility to coordinate or assist with any of the circumstances set forth in subdivisions 1 through 6 above.\n \n And finally see how Virginia has chosen to arm (or not arm, as the case really is) the members of the state's \"defense force\":\n \n \u00a7 44-54.12. Arms, equipment and facilities. - The Virginia State Defense Force, to the extent authorized by the Governor and funded by the General Assembly, shall be equipped as needed for training and for state active duty. The Adjutant General, by regulation or otherwise, may authorize the use of privately owned real and personal property if deemed in the best interest of the Commonwealth.\n \n To the extent permitted by federal law and contracts with the federal government or localities and to the extent that space is available, the Adjutant General in his discretion may authorize the use of armories and other facilities of the National Guard, other state facilities under his control, and all or portions of privately owned facilities under contract for the storage and maintenance of arms, equipment and supplies of the Virginia State Defense Force and for the assembly, drill, training and instruction of its members.\n \n Members of the Virginia State Defense Force shall not be armed with firearms during the performance of training duty or state active duty, except under circumstances and in instances authorized by the Governor. \n \n Notice this statute in particular reflects the need to bow towards Washington (\"To the extent permitted by federal law....\"). This is because all the above is contingent on the federal statute that allowed it. Congress has the power to rearrange or even prohibit all this if it wanted to do so. \n \n Of course, now that I think about it, if Stevens is correct and the \"2nd. Amendment only protects a state's right to have an armed militia\" (and he is not), then there would have never been a statute that specifically authorized states to create their own \"defense forces.\" That power would already exist by virtue of this interpretation of the 2nd. Amendment, and a separate congressional act to authorize it would be superfluous. I wonder if Stevens will get around to addressing this point now that he has retired and has more time to consider his argument.... \n \n But returning to the U.S. Code for a moment, there are some interesting code sections in Title 50 that deal with insurrection. Here is one that deals with any armed group that is involved in an insurrection (be it the state's \"defense force\" or a group of private individuals), and what happens if the state does not disavow it and attempt to suppress their actions:\n \n 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 205 - Suspension of commercial intercourse with State in insurrection\n \n Whenever the President, in pursuance of the provisions of this chapter, has called forth the militia to suppress combinations against the laws of the United States, and to cause the laws to be duly executed, and the insurgents shall have failed to disperse by the time directed by the President, and when the insurgents claim to act under the authority of any State or States, and such claim is not disclaimed or repudiated by the persons exercising the functions of government in such State or States, or in the part or parts thereof in which such combination exists, and such insurrection is not suppressed by such State or States, or whenever the inhabitants of any State or part thereof are at any time found by the President to be in insurrection against the United States, the President may, by proclamation, declare that the inhabitants of such State, or of any section or part thereof where such insurrection exists, are in a state of insurrection against the United States; and thereupon all commercial intercourse by and between the same and the citizens thereof and the citizens of the rest of the United States shall cease and be unlawful so long as such condition of hostility shall continue; and all goods and chattels, wares and merchandise, coming from such State or section into the other parts of the United States, or proceeding from other parts of the United States to such State or section, by land or water, shall, together with the vessel or vehicle conveying the same, or conveying persons to or from such State or section, be forfeited to the United States.",

   "You again Galileo? This should be amusing, sad and frustrating all at the same time.\n \n \nI wonder if Justice Breyer is thinking of what Jack Rakove has said about the matter when he says that historians side with him. Jack Rakove is a professor of history at Standford University and won a Pulitzer Prize for his book, Original Meanings: Politics and Ideas in the Making of the Constitution.\n\n \n Before we get into this issue too far let's remember how last night Brady was citing the work of Michael A Bellesiles. Bellesiles was also a professor of history, but he had been charged with misconduct and lost his Bancroft award as well as position at Emory. So simply because this Jack Rakove is a professor of history, that doesn't make him anymore accurate or trustworthy than someone who isn't a professor of history.\n \n And now on with the rest of this mess.\n \n \n\"Rakove argues, however, that the Virginian [Madison] never really believed in a bill of rights, but instead supported it because of a 'campaign conversion' required to placate his constituents and to save his political career....\n\n \n I'm really not sure how this would work out in terms of real world function. The US Constitution was ratified in 1788 while the Bill of Rights wasn't ratified until 1791. That's a three year difference between the two. And I find it very hard to swallow the notion that if Madison only supported the bill of rights for the sole purpose of appeasing his constituents, that there would be a three year difference in the two.\n \n Do you have anything to attempt to explain why there was a window of three years between the two documents? The fact that so much time had passed really throws cold water on a lot of what you've presented here and adopted as your own position.\n \n \n\"Rakove concedes that Madison did see nominal benefits in a bill of rights.... The Anti-Federalists envisioned a bill of rights protecting the majority from a tyrannical minority &#8211; a king or dictator. But Madison envisioned the opposite. He saw a bill of rights protecting the minority from a tyrannical majority acting through a popularly-elected legislature.\n\n \n The way I'm reading this it looks like Jack Rakove, as well as you since you've adopted his argument as his own, is trying to claim that the purpose of the Bill of Rights wasn't to protect the people from the government, but rather to protect the people from the people. Basically a claim of the Bill of Rights being necessary to protect the citizenry from itself, by allowing the government to step in and tell the people what was in their best interest, as if they were too stupid and incompetent to make decisions for themselves.\n \n \nWhile Madison still believed that parchment barriers by themselves could not protect rights, he did admit that they could help. A federal bill of rights could help educate the public about its rights, making it less likely that an ignorant majority would trample minority rights. A bill of rights would also provide a weapon with which victims of oppression could seek redress in court. That is, a bill of rights would enable the Supreme Court to strike down unjust laws.\n\n \n I don't really think that this was even in the ballpark when it came to drafting and ratifying the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. If what you were saying were true then the issue of slavery would have never lasted as long as it did. There were several Civil Rights Acts passed in history, in 1866, 1875, 1957 and 1966. With this in mind one can't help but wonder. If the Bill of Rights was to provide a weapon to victims of oppression to seek redress in court, why did it take so long for these acts to be passed after the ratification of the Bill of Rights? Why did it take 75 years before the first Civil Rights Act, which extended the legal protection of individual rights to freed slaves, to be passed in the first place?\n \n \n\"But overall, Rakove maintains, Madison still saw a bill of rights as useless, and only backed it as 'a tub to the whale,' or a sop[something yielded to placate or soothe] to the Anti-Federalists.\"\n http://www.ou.edu/carlalbertcenter/extensions/winter2010/Leibiger.pdf\n\n \n Regardless of what Jack Rakove might have to say on the issue of what he feels the Founding Fathers talked about over breakfast and what their political ideals were, it all amounts to water under the bridge since his opinion isn't accepted by the mainstream system.\n \n \nSaul Cornell provides an example of how personal self defense was considered to be a matter of common law, not constitutional law.\n\n \n As I said above when referring to the credentials of Jack Rakove, simply because this Saul Cornell is a professor of history, that doesn't make him anymore accurate or trustworthy than someone who isn't a professor of history.\n \n And now to dissect the rest of this frog.\n \n \nIn 1799, Dr. James Reynolds pulled out a pistol to defend himself against an angry mob. Reynolds was knocked to the ground and disarmed. Later, Reynolds was charged with assault with a deadly weapon. Cornell explains that in the ensuing trial:\n \n \"The argument over the right to use firearms touched no constitutional question but did raise an issue under common law.

The issue here isn't about Reynolds being in possession of a firearm, it's the manner in which he used it. He wasn't charged with possession of a firearm in a manner unconnected with militia service, he was charged with assault with a deadly weapon. There's a great deal of difference with the two and it makes a very big impact on the rest of the case.\n \n You really can't argue that the Second Amendment was only about militia purposes, when someone possessing a firearm can't be charged with possession of a firearm unconnected with militia services and duties. You don't get to have both sides of the coin in this matter because it doesn't work that way.\n \n This case also doesn't provide \"a rare and remarkable glimpse into how leading lawyers of the early republic viewed carrying firearms outside of the context of bearing them as part of a well-regulated militia.\" Reynolds wasn't charged with carrying a firearm outside of the context of bearing them as part of a well-regulated militia, meaning that his possession of said firearm wasn't protected by the law and the constitution. He was charged with assault with a deadly weapon, for failure to retreat to the demanded extent before drawing for the purpose of defending himself.\n \n What the Reynolds case does though, is provide a historical basis for the importance of today's Castle Doctrine laws which remove the duty to retreat from current law standards.",

You seem to be grasping at straws trying to figure out any way possible, to pry our Bill of Rights from our hands. \n \n Yes the Federalist said that the Bill of Rights, was, (and this is the important part,) UNNECESSARY, because the government was already restrained to act within these areas because Congress was not delegated the power to do so. Federalist 78.\n \n However, the Anti-Federalist said, No Way, Jack, or (Steven Bryer), if you wish. Without specific guarantees, we will not sing in the dotted line. Period! Get It! Now go away or I&#8217;ll show you my gun if you want to get uppity! emoticon_smile I added the last part for dramatic emphasis. emoticon_smile\n \n From our National Archives. \n  The Bill Of Rights ~ The First Ten Amendments to the Constitution \n Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, the right to a fair and speedy trial&#8211;the ringing phrases that inventory some of Americans' most treasured personal freedoms&#8211;were not initially part of the U.S. Constitution. At the Constitutional Convention, the proposal to include a bill of rights was considered and defeated. The Bill of Rights was added to the Constitution as the first ten amendments on December 15, 1791.\n \n The fact that the Constitution did not include a bill of rights to specifically protect Americans' hard-won rights sparked the most heated debates during the ratification process. To the Federalists, those who favored the Constitution, a bill of rights was unnecessary because the Federal Government was limited in its powers and could not interfere with the rights of the people or the states; also, most states had bills of rights. To the Anti-Federalists, those who opposed the Constitution, the prospect of establishing a strong central government without an explicit list of rights guaranteed to the people was unthinkable. Throughout the ratification process, individuals and state ratification conventions called for the adoption of a bill of rights.\n\n The Anti Federalist won that demand! Period! What Madison, or any one else believed, meant SQUAT!\n \n At the time of the writing of the Bill of Rights, Madison was nothing more than a hired man, doing the dictates of the only owners of this country. We the People. He said, &#8220; Owners of this country, what do you want?&#8221; OK then. Yes Sir. Yes Madam. Your wish is my command! \n \n Less than 100 years later, We the People stuck a fork into such Bovine Excrement arguments by the passage of the 14th Amendment!   Which was in part a Right to Keep and Bear PERSONAL ARMS Amendment.  In essence, the 2nd Amendment was proposed, passed, and ratified, not only once, but also now twice!",

I don't know if Breyer takes his inspiration for a collective-militia-only right from Rakove, but the article's author-fellow academic Mr. Leibiger-seems to draw a different conclusion. He takes Rakove to task for, in his opinion, missing the point: \n \n But overall, Rakove maintains, Madison still saw a bill of rights as useless, and only backed it as \"a tub to the whale,\" or a sop to the Anti-Federalists. But perhaps Rakove underestimates the extent to which the Virginian's support of rights-related amendments was principled and theoretical as well as political, especially if we look at the bill of rights he wanted rather than the one he got.6 For Madison, a bill of rights provided a second chance for his pet project: to obtain the congressional veto of state laws that he had tried, but failed, to achieve at the 1787 Convention. If a bill of rights could be made to apply not only to the federal government, but to the states as well, it would be almost as good as the congressional veto.\n \n Doesn't this quote from the article suggest that Madison did not feel the BoR was useless, but instead was viewed as another way to achieve some grand design? The article (citing Rakove for inspiration) suggests Madison feared tyranny more from a state government than a federal one: \n \n Rakove shows how Madison developed a variety of political concepts to solve the problem of majority tyranny. Turning conventional wisdom on its head, Madison argued - first in his 1787 essay \"Vices of the Political System of the United States,\" and later in his famous Federalist 10 - that liberty would be safer in a large Republic (the size of the United States) than in a small republic (the size of a state). There would be such a multiplicity of interests in a large republic that no single self-interested faction would be able to forge a tyrannical majority. Instead, various interests would cancel each other out, allowing the public good and minority rights to prevail. An extended republic, moreover, would enjoy the benefits of a \"filtration of talent,\" as larger electoral districts would result in the election of wiser and more far-sighed leaders than the narrowminded men who found their way into the state legislatures.\n \n The rest of the article strongly suggests that Madison's aim throughout the Amendment process was to limit the tyrannical power of the smaller legislative majorities in the states. To re-quote the article's speculation:\n \n For Madison, a bill of rights provided a second chance for his pet project: to obtain the congressional veto of state laws that he had tried, but failed, to achieve at the 1787 Convention. If a bill of rights could be made to apply not only to the federal government, but to the states as well, it would be almost as good as the congressional veto.\n \n To me, this fellow academic's reading of Rakove does not offer any support for the \"state's right\" or \"militia only\" view of the 2nd. Amendment. If the above arguments about Madison's intentions are true, then Madison certainly does not write the 2nd. Amendment with the aim of limiting the \"right of the people\" to only empowering the very states whose power he wishes to limit to arm militias which they could then use to enforce the tyranny of a legislative majority....\n \n Wouldn't a more proper reading of this argument be: If Madison had in mind to limit the state's ability to oppress their people, then doesn't he really mean \"the right of the people\" and not \"the right of the states\" when he wrote \"the write of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed\"-that neither the federal nor a state legislative majority should be allowed to infringe upon the people's right to have individual arms to protect themselves from the tyranny of either?\n \n In any event, the article you cite leads me to wonder how Madison would have viewed the 14th. Amendment if he had lived long enough to see it..... \n \n Turning to the self-defense case. At first glance, before I read the Cornell article, I admit it was tempting to argue that one case is a very small cherry pulled from a much larger tree, and that one case involving a couple of trial dog lawyers does not a quorum make. However, Cornell does argue that this case involved the \"leading legal minds of the day,\" and I have no reason to dispute this. So I looked into the actual arguments Cornell cited. Having done so it is my opinion-agree or disagree as you will-that Cornell completely misses the legal issue, and that when properly understood it does not support his case. \n \n I would first note that this case does not address the 2nd. Amendment at all, for it was unquestioned at that time (the suppositions about Madison's views in the article cited above notwithstanding) the BoR applied exclusively as a bar to federal action, while this was a state court prosecution involving state laws. Therefore, it was only the Pennsylvania Constitution's RKBA provision which was potentially an issue. Nevertheless, I believe Cornell tries to use this case as a cutting out expedition to divorce the Pennsylvania RKBA provision from the individual right of armed self-defense-no doubt with an aim to later making a similar claim against the 2nd. Amendment. \n \n But here is where I believe Cornell displays his lack of understanding of legal arguments....Cornell argues that \"nether side believed that the use of a gun for personal self defense had any connection to the constitutional right to bear arms protected by the Pennsylvania Constitution.\" Now I have not read the transcript, and so admittedly Cornell has me at a disadvantage-I must rely entirely on the information he cites for his claim. Yet as far as I can see he arrives at this conclusion not by any direct evidence-no quotations from the transcript, for example. Rather, he argues in the negative-the transcript apparently shows that neither side argued over the wording of the RKBA provision, but they instead focused a great deal of time on their arguments over the proper scope of the common law right of self-defense. In my opinion Cornell clearly wants us to believe that the reason why the RKBA provision was not debated was because it must have nothing at all to do with private self-defense. \n \n But let me put the actual wording of the Pennsylvania RKBA provision (as adopted on August 16, 1776) to a more candid audience: \n \n That the people have a right to bear arms for the defense of themselves and the state; And as standing armies in the time of peace are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be kept up; And that the military should be kept under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power. (emphasis added by me)\n \n Can anyone here argue with a straight face that the highlighted language does not recognize a right of individual self-defense? Yet Cornell would have us believe that not just a first year law student but the \"leading legal minds of the day\" would miss the obvious argument-that the words \"the people have a right to bear arms for the defense of themselves\" meant their client had a constitutional right to act in self-defense?\n \n Come back to the case Cornell cites. The argument is not made because it was not required to be made. If the prosecution had argued that the defendant had no right to act in self-defense at all, then the \"leading legal minds of the day\" representing the defendant would have had to argue the obvious-the RKBA provision enshrines this very right. From what I can see they never had to cite the RKBA provision to make this argument because the prosecution conceded that the defendant had a right to act in self-defense. When you look at the arguments that Cornell cites from both sides, the issue is clearly not whether the defendant had a right to act in self-defense but whether his claim to have acted in self-defense was justified. Cornell glosses over this fact. \n \n Cornell's supposition is also flawed because, in my opinion, it flows from a basic misunderstanding of the link between the common law right of self-defense and the RKBA provision. In my opinion he believes they are totally separate entities. But notice the RKBA provision only says \"defense of themselves.\" It does not define what the right of self-defense is. It does not tell us, for example, under what circumstances the exercise of the right is justified, and under what circumstances it is not. \n \n This is because it does not need to. And here is where Cornell demonstrates his fatal misunderstanding. He believes the RKBA provision created a separate right, and that the failure to claim this separate right means the defense team felt it did not create an individual right at all. But the Pennsylvania RKBA provision did not create a new and separate right, it only recognized and protected the common law right of armed self-defense that pre-existed the Pennsylvania Constitution which the defendant did claim-the very right the prosecution concedes when both sides argue what the scope of this right really is. Cornell fails to understand this, and so he fails to understand why the argument over the meaning of the RKBA provision did not take place. \n \n And so my opinion is the lack of argument over the RKBA provision flows from an acknowledgement that there is no argument to make. And this happens far more often than you might think. For example, every case that involves a suppression hearing on a claim that evidence was seized in violation of the 4th. Amendment involves the threshold question of whether the person seeking to suppress the evidence had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the place searched or the thing seized. For example, none of you live with me, and none of you has a right to complain that evidence was seized illegally from my house. But in almost every case this issue of who can make the 4th. Amendment violation claim is conceded up front. If, for example, drugs are seized from a car at a traffic stop, then we never waste time arguing that the owner/driver did or did not have an expectation of privacy in the contents of his car. We concede that issue and move on to the real issue-it is not about whether he had a 4th. Amendment right of privacy in the car, but whether the search of his car violated that right. \n \n Cornell's lack of citing any argument to the contrary shows that the same is true in the case he mentions. The RKBA provision tells us that the defendant had a right to possess a firearm for the purpose of being prepared for armed self-defense. It also tells us that he had a right to use the firearm in armed self-defense. But these were not issues in the case. The question in this case is not whether he had a right to possess the firearm or even that he had a right to use it in self-defense. The question was whether he was really acting in self-defense. \n \n And that, as the lawyers correctly argued in the case Cornell cites, is a matter of interpreting the nature and the scope of the common law right the RKBA provision protects. In exercising this protected right did the defendant have to retreat to the wall, or could he stand his ground before using or threatening the use of deadly force? Did the nature of the harm to him rise to a level that justified the use or threat of deadly force? These are all questions that are not answered by looking at the RKBA provision but by searching out the parameters of the common law right the RKBA provision protects. It is little wonder then that the \"leading legal minds of the day\" confined their arguments to the actual issue in the case, and it should not come as a surprise to an unbiased historian that an RKBA provision which was never an issue was not discussed. \n \n But of course I am no recognized historian, and my biases for gun rights are admittedly well documented on this blog cite. I will say in my favor that I have far more experience in actually arguing the common law right of self-defense before a court than Cornell does. It is up to the reader to act as judge and determine which of us has the better argument....",

   "Before I begin explaining my take on this matter I want to reiterate an earlier point. I'm not a history professor, nor am I a law expert. But I do feel that I have a better grasp of understanding than these so-called \"professors of history\" who use their position as a method of furthering agenda over reason and facts, such as Michael A Bellesiles has done.\n \n Now that the disclaimer is out of the way I think we can get down to the meat and bone of this matter.\n \n \nNathan Kozuskanich, a professor of history at NiXXXXXXX University, agrees with Cornell:\n \"In the end, the jury sided with the defense and acquitted Reynolds.

This, however, seems to me to be a rather odd approach if the Pennsylvania Constitution was commonly understood to protect a right to carry a weapon in self defense. Why not bring up the RKBA in the Pennsylvania Constitution rather than just pointing out the absence of a prohibition?\n\n \n There's a lot of interesting points to be found here, some of which are quite damaging to a number of political agendas and positions. So let's examine them.\n \n First is the question regarding Pennsylvania's RKBA provision and why it wasn't raised in the case of Mr. Reynolds. I believe the reason is because it wasn't at issue. There was no prohibition on carrying arms that was cited in this case. Mr. Reynolds was charged with assault with a deadly weapon. He wasn't charged with illegal possession of a weapon, he wasn't charged with possession of a firearm in a manner unconnected with militia purposes and/or duties. So we know that means it wasn't Mr. Reynolds being armed that was at issue, what was at issue was whether or not his brandishing of a firearm in response to an angry mob was justified under Pennsylvania law.\n \n This simply doesn't seem like a Second Amendment case, but rather a deadly force case. I believe it would've been the same had Mr. Reynolds used an axe, pitchfork or even crossbow in an attempt to defend himself, because all of these constitute a deadly weapon capable of issuing deadly force. Hence the charge of \"assault with a deadly weapon.\" I really don't believe that either Saul Cornell or Nathan Kozuskanich have any grounds for calling this a Second Amendment case.\n \n Had Mr. Reynolds been charged with something that actually involved him being in possession of a firearm at the time, such as violating some statute against carrying arms, then there might be a case here. But the fact of the matter is that he wasn't. Therefore there was no need to made a RKBA provision claim.\n \n A proper comparison to this case would be two neighbors citing for disturbing the peace for having a very vocal argument. What was being said didn't fall into either hate speech or fighting words, what was being said was simply at an extremely high decibel level and could be heard by multiple neighbors several houses away. Why wouldn't the First Amendment be offered as a defense against the citation? Because what was being said wasn't at issue, but rather the volume at which the two in dispute were expressing themselves.\n \n Now for some very interesting points raised by this Reynolds case. I quote your cited article directly here: \"there is no danger to be apprehended from a man who carries a sword-cane or other weapon of defence; there is no law in Pennsylvania to prevent it; every man has a right to carry arms who apprehends himself to be in danger.\"\n \n That to me says that even during the time of the Founding Fathers it was understood that a person has the right to be armed for their own defense, even when they aren't inside their own homes. This claim suggests it was commonly recognized that a person's right to defend themselves with a firearm extended to wherever they had a legal right to be in a public setting. And since Mr. Reynolds was acquitted of the charges against him, and the fact that he was never charged with possession of a weapon, I feel that this is a case I can cite in response to any future instance in which you choose to cite the \"longstanding prohibitions\" section of the Heller ruling. I can even cite this case anytime someone tries to claim that a person's right to be armed for their own defense is limited strictly to their home and nowhere else.\n \n Another point is raised in response to your post in this thread: http://www.4forums.com/political/420461-post14.html\n \n \nI have heard gun activists claim that guns are the great equalizer. It seems to me that this claim is very questionable and that, obviously, a gun benefits the person greatly who has the advantage of surprise. Consider the example of John Hinckley who attempted to assassinate a US president. Why was Hinckley able to injure three people despite all of the secret service agents near him? Because he had the advantage of surprise. An advantage which is likely magnified by having a gun since more destruction can be committed with a gun between the time a criminal begins to attack and the time that people are able to respond defensively to an attack than with a more primitive weapon. A person who receives a concealed carry license after attending a three hour class is in an even less desirable position to defend against a crime with a gun than a secret service agent who is probably one of the most skilled people in the world at using a gun in self defense. Because of the limited effectiveness of guns as a self defense tools and because a gun may promote a false sense of security leading to a greater willingness to take risks, I don't think I'd ever carry a gun for self defense.\n\n \n Here you state that a gun is an ineffective tool of defense. Yet your citing of the Reynolds case seems to contradict this previous position you made by showing just one of many examples of how firearms have historically been seen as the best defensive tool available for personal use. the historical precedence of the Reynolds case seems to undermine your previous position that guns simply aren't effective for when it comes to matters of personal defense.\n \n And now onto the other matters raised.\n \n \n\"In the eighteenth century, however, bills of rights were often regarded as statements of principle, meant to inform and shape the political behavior of both officials and citizens; but whether they established [Page 111] legally enforceable claims was far from certain.[22]\n\n \n Again I must disagree with you and Jack Rakove. There is a great deal of certainty that the amendments within the Bill of Rights establish legally enforceable claims. We have records regarding many Supreme Court cases, dating back to its very creation, that show how laws have been found unconstitutional on the basis of violating the protections recognized in the Bill of Rights.\n \n If you'd like then I'd be happy to cite a number of cases where it's been found a law violated the people's right to public display, or their freedom of speech, or their right to a speedy and public trial, etc. There's certainly a wealth of cases to choose from. That's a lot of historical precedent for Jack Rakove to suggest has no meaning.\n \n \nMany clauses in the first eight amendments to the Constitution certainly aspired to have and eventually acquired that character, but the Second Amendment is arguably the one provision which partook most of the principle-enunciating attributes of the early state declarations of rights. Our quest to discover a perfect syntax and vocabulary for its twenty-seven words thus risks ascribing to a general statement of principle a measure of legal exactitude it was never conceived to carry.\"\n\n \n Once more, with more clarity this time around.\n \n \nWhen I read this, the question that comes to mind is- Would the federalists have felt that it was necessary for the Bill of Rights to establish legally enforceable claims?\n\n \n I certainly think so. They had to deal with the shenanigans of King George, they knew what damage could be done by the government without proper safe guards.\n \n \nI think a common understanding at that time was that the only power the federal government had was the power explicitly granted to it by the US Constitution. Thus, a Bill of Rights would establish no limitations on government power that did not already exist. So were the federalists just trying to be redundant or does the motivation for creating the Bill of Rights have more to do with politics?\n\n \n It's amazing what one's interpretation can do to the words of a law or contract. When I see the shenanigans being carried out by ignorant police and government officials, antics that require the legislature to repeatedly pass laws that clarify the meaning of a previously passed law, I feel it's these types of people the Founding Fathers had in mind when they felt a Bill of Rights was necessary.\n \n You made the claim that the Bill of Rights wasn't all that necessary, because the Constitution itself had adequate protection for the people already. That might've been the case at the time when those who wrote the Constitution were alive and able to set the record straight. But what about 50 or so years down the line when they were all dead and their knowledge was taken to the grave with them? What was to prevent a future congress from eventually deciding that since the Constitution didn't specifically limit their power to regulate religion, say under the guise of enforcing the Commerce Clause, that meant it was allowed for them to dictate matters regarding the exercise of religion?\n \n That's something that must always be considered when it comes to discussions like this. Any power hungry individual will look for whatever loophole they can exploit to gain that much more authority over the people. They could look at the Constitution, decide that lack of an explicitly spelled out prohibition on government power meant that no such prohibition applied and they had the authority to step in and handle the matter in whatever fashion they chose.\n \n The Constitution affords absolutely no power for the federal government to assemble and maintain a standing army that answers only to congress and not the people of the republic. And yet that's exactly what we have now, showing that the government isn't interested in obeying the limitations within the Constitution on its power and authority.",

Here the lawyer seems to be saying that there is no statute prohibiting the carrying of weapon in self defense and thus common law justified the defendant's decision to carry a pistol. This, however, seems to me to be a rather odd approach if the Pennsylvania Constitution was commonly understood to protect a right to carry a weapon in self defense. Why not bring up the RKBA in the Pennsylvania Constitution rather than just pointing out the absence of a prohibition? \n \n Back to Jack Rakove:\n \n \"In the eighteenth century, however, bills of rights were often regarded as statements of principle, meant to inform and shape the political behavior of both officials and citizens; but whether they established [Page 111] legally enforceable claims was far from certain.[22] Many clauses in the first eight amendments to the Constitution certainly aspired to have and eventually acquired that character, but the Second Amendment is arguably the one provision which partook most of the principle-enunciating attributes of the early state declarations of rights. Our quest to discover a perfect syntax and vocabulary for its twenty-seven words thus risks ascribing to a general statement of principle a measure of legal exactitude it was never conceived to carry.\"\n Chicago-Kent Law Review\n \n When I read this, the question that comes to mind is- Would the federalists have felt that it was necessary for the Bill of Rights to establish legally enforceable claims? I think a common understanding at that time was that the only power the federal government had was the power explicitly granted to it by the US Constitution. Thus, a Bill of Rights would establish no limitations on government power that did not already exist. So were the federalists just trying to be redundant or does the motivation for creating the Bill of Rights have more to do with politics?\n\n \n Thanks for the link, Galileo. It was an interesting read. To answer your questions, the defense lawyer did not mention the Pennsylvania RKBA provision because he did not have to. The statutory law and the common law were not in conflict. There was no claim that he did not have a right to defend himself with a firearm. If there had been a statute to prevent his having or using a firearm, then there would have been a conflict with the constitutional provision which would have required the lawyer to argue it. \n \n Both Cornell and Kozuskanich read this case wrongly because they do not (or chose not to) understand the issue in the case the lawyers were arguing over. Come back for a moment to Cornell's argument: \"Although the defense attorney's had readily resorted to constitutional arguments to support their client's right to assemble, the relied on the common law doctrine to sanction the use of a pistol for self defense.\" (Kozuskanich makes the same argument in his article) Both are flat wrong here. The defense attorney is not arguing to support his client's right to assemble. In fact, in the entire case neither side was arguing over what Dr. Reynold's rights were, they were arguing over what his intentions were. The only real issue in the case was this: \n \n Why did Dr. Reynolds and the other defendant's go to the church on that day? \n \n Cornell misses this point in his haste to assume facts not in evidence. Because he has no direct evidence for his theory, he assumes the absence of the mention of a constitutional RKBA means no such right was believed to exist-and he assumes that the mention of the right to petition government proves this point. But does Cornell tell you which right to petition is being argued? No, and this omission (whether intentional or inadvertent) is significant. Follow me now....\n \n The Pennsylvania Constitution also contained this right:\n \n That the people have a right to assemble together, to consult for their common good, to instruct their representatives, and to apply to the legislature for redress of grievances, by address, petition, or remonstrance.\n \n But if you read the arguments advanced by the defense which Galileo has kindly linked, you will see that the defense never once mentions this state constitutional right. In fact, the right he mentions is the federal 1st. amendment right to petition-which has no legal force or effect in a state prosecution. The defense team completely ignored the state constitutional right to petition that the state court could recognize and enforce. The question is why? Apply Cornell's logic to answer this question. According to his \"did not mention it\" logic you would have to conclude that the defense lawyer's failure to mention the Pennsylvania Constitutional protection to petition the government means that the lawyer did not believe the Pennsylvania Constitution protected any such right. This is clearly false, and so is Cornell's premise. No, Mr. Cornell, there is a different answer which you have ignored.\n \n The answer is because the lawyer is not trying to argue constitutional law. On a blog site like this people tend to fight straw men. In a court room the defense attorney does not have this luxury-he must deal with the arguments the prosecutor makes. The prosecutor focuses on the intent of the men charged-he alleged that they intentionally set about a course of conduct with the purpose of inciting a riot, and that the firearm was carried for the purpose of using it in the riot. \n \n The defense argument is an answer to that charge. The defense lawyer does not mention the federal right to petition government because he wanted the state courts to recognize it and use it to bar a conviction (for it could not be). In the defense theory, the intent of Dr. Reynolds and others when they went to the church was to obtain signatures on a petition to Congress. That is why he mentions the federal right-not because he says the right exists and must result in acquittal, but because it explains what his clients were doing and what their motives were. \n \n Consider the facts they are arguing about. It was admitted that Dr. Reynolds was motivated by a belief that a recent act of the national Congress regarding aliens was unconstitutional and should be repealed. The prosecution argued that he was in effect incensed by this and went to the church with the intent to start a riot, and that he armed himself with the intent to use the firearm in the riot. The Defense argued that he went for another purpose that was altogether peaceful-to obtain signatures on a petition which he intended to use to argue that Congress should repeal the law it had passed; and the firearm was carried because Dr. Reynolds reasonably feared he might be attacked in the process. This is why the unenforceable federal right to petition is discussed-because it was the motive behind the defendant's actions. If you understand this point then you understand the flow of the arguments of the lawyers-not to recognize and enforce a right, but to explain a person's conduct. I am surprised that a historian cannot understand this. The fact of the matter is Cornell's \"mention one but did not mention the other\" supposition is completely false. \n \n Now turn to the firearm argument. This is the essence of the defense argument (see the focus on the intent):\n \n Gentlemen why was this pistol put in Dr Reynolds pocket? Was it to murder Gallagher? Was it with a design to use it on this occasion? No. I am sorry to say that we found occasion for the evidence of Mr Clay. When we heard his evidence every man here must have seen occasion for him to wear a pistol; every man must be convinced that there was a plot to assassinate Dr Reynolds. Mr Clay is a gentleman of known integrity and veracity and would not suffer this impression to be made on his mind without his conclusions were drawn from the strongest evidence. There can be no doubt but there did exist a conspiracy to assassinate Dr Reynolds which was communicated to him prior to this time so soon as he heard it he asked advice; he asks \"shall I carry a pistol?\" He is told that there is no security in a pistol. That the danger was such as to require a more secure weapon for defence and that he ought to carry a dirk. What man would have hesitated to protect himself against a menace of that kind? I appeal to every man in Court. I appeal to the Attorney General himself on this point. He carries a sword cane and so do I. There are many gentlemen in this country who from the occasion of the times and the combination of circumstances also wear sword canes. There were two periods when every one wore weapons of defence from necessity. The first when the police was so defective that robberies were constant and self protection became necessary through the defects of the law. The second when political fury rose to such a height as in 1785 6 that it no longer became a question of defence against robbers but against political opponents. The times are altered, or party violence has become less serious; we see, indeed, that the spirit of party yet preserves a disposition to assassination in the threats against Dr R's life, and that he at the present time has occasion to act on the defensive as every one did at these periods; there is no danger to be apprehended from a man who carries a sword cane or other weapon of defence; there is no law in Pennsylvania to prevent it; every man has a right to carry arms who apprehends himself to be in danger; If every man has a right, was not this gentleman justifiable in putting arms in his pocket when so special an occasion commanded him? Here there is no danger of error; it was a mere accidental circumstance of Mr Clay lodging in the same house that brought the design on Dr Reynolds life to his knowledge. Mr Clay is a man of too high credit and acknowledged understanding to render what he says questionable. The court must be satisfied of its propriety from so respectable an authority. \n \n A few observations on this argument....1. The argument assumes the universal agreement that a man has an individual RKBA-even to the point of arguing knowledge that the prosecutor himself carried concealed. 2. Again the argument is not over whether a RKBA exists or not, but what were Dr. Reynold's motives for carrying the firearm. 3. There is no way an honest historian can assume from this that a lawyer believes the Pennsylvania RKBA statute does not recognize a right to armed self-defense.\n \n Where is it, Mr. Cornell and Mr. Kozuskanich? Where does the defense team assume the Pennsylvania Constitution does not recognize a right to armed self-defense?\n \n Now the relevant portion of the prosecutor's argument (see again what the real issue is-not the Doctor's rights, but the Doctor's intent):\n \n Can there be a doubt but Dr Reynolds drew pistol with intent to murder Mr Gallagher? Will any persons suppose if he drew a loaded pistol declaring he would shoot any person that insulted him that he did not do it with intent to commit murder? Can it be that he did not intend to commit murder because he did not commit murder? If that is a fair argument murder must always be committed or it cannot be intended or the intention cannot be indictable at all. Is it not to be supposed that he intended some desperate act when he declared at the same time that he would shoot any person who should insult him? But another reason is this: he did not put this pistol in his pocket for nothing; he put it there under some bloody design; he did it strictly agreeably to the instructions of his great teacher the member of the House of Representatives of the United States; he doubtless did it with a view to execute a desperate object to go through the business at all events. \n But you have been told that all this was justifiable by the assault made him by Mr Gallagher. But Mr G was doing a lawful act; he was exercising his duty. If an officer in the exercise of his duty is killed; the person who kills him is guilty of murder; but if that officer kills the person while in the unavoidable duty he is engaged in, he must be acquitted. \n Gallagher had a right to put Reynolds from the ground to execute his duty at all events; but if Reynolds had killed Gallagher, he would have been guilty of murder. So a sheriff's officer, though he makes the first attack, which office he is right in doing, if he is killed in the execution of that duty, the other is guilty of murder. Contrary to this doctrine, Mr. Dallas has said Dr Reynolds had a right to kill this young man. I say he had not, even this had happened in common street, much less in that church yard, for no man can justify murder by assault; the law does not. The law says if a man attack you by a sword you have no right to kill him till you have made every attempt to escape, but not in any instance to take his life, unless it be save life; for nothing is the value of life, but life. This may happen every day otherwise, and we should be drawn into a system of legalizing bloodshed and murder if this were the case. \n I take it then gentlemen that in the case of Dr Reynolds he is without any kind of justification for his conduct; he was on the premises of another man, who had a right to put him out of it. And as to the others who tried to assist him, they were the same, because they came with the same intentions. The gentleman himself has only endeavoured to controvert the force of the evidence by law, but no law can be found to justify such conduct as either of these persons was guilty of, and particularly Dr Reynolds. From the whole of the evidence and the directions of the law you can do no other than find these persons guilty according to the indictment.\n \n The prosecution does not argue the Doctor had no right to have the firearm, or that no constitutional right exists to carry the firearm. He does not dispute the claim that the doctor had a right to use the firearm in self-defense. He argues two things: 1. That the Doctor's intent was to commit violence and he was not acting in self-defense; and, in the alternative 2. Even if the court should believe he thought he was acting in self-defense his conduct did not conform to the law of self-defense.\n \n Now I agree we are talking about the common law here, for that is where you define the right of self-defense. As I have said earlier-and both Cornell and Kozuskanich have either missed or chosen to ignore-the Pennsylvania constitution did not create or define a right of self-defense, it only acknowleged that the common law right existed, and it recognized a right to have a firearm for that purpose. This was never in dispute. The prosecutor never argued that the Doctor had no right to put the pistol in his pocket when he stepped outside that day. He only argued that his purpose for doing so was not for self-defense, that when he displayed it he was not acting in self-defense, and that even if the court has a doubt about whether he was acting in self-defense his actions did not conform to what the law of self-defense allows.\n \n Where is it, Mr. Cornell and Mr. Kozuskanich? Where does the prosecutor (who allegedly carries concealed himself) assume the Pennsylvania Constitution does not recognize a right to armed self-defense?\n \n It's just not there in the record. I know Cornell and Kozuskanich hold themselves out as historians, but their writings on this case display either innocent ignorance of the subject matter or a belief that no one will come behind them and check to see if they are in fact deliberately misleading the reader. \n \n Once again I find reason to question either Cornell's ability or veracity. Kozuskanich would do well in the future to refuse to imitate him. \n \n Back to Rakove....I agree with some of what he says here. I have always argued that the militia clause of the amendment is nothing more than a statement of principle. That is why it says \"free\" state-relying on a militia is the best way to avoid tyranny. \n \n AS far as avoiding problems with interpretation as Rakove fears, why not try the method SCOTUS has always used:\n \n \"This Court has constantly reiterated that the language of the Constitution where clear and unambiguous must be given its plain evident meaning.\" Reid v. Covert, 354 U.S. 1, 8, n. 7 (1957) (plurality opinion)\n \n In other words, the words said what was meant, and they mean what they say. \n \n I think both federalists and anti-federalists believed the congress was limited by enumerated powers. The dispute was whether the limitation was enough. The Bill of Rights is an acknowledgement that the limits were not enough, and specific rights needed further protection from an overly expanded reading of the enumerated powers.",

   "I believe the motivation for including the Second Amendment in the Bill of Rights was this fear, expressed by George Mason:\n \"Should the national government wish to render the militia useless, they may neglect them, and let them perish, in order to have a pretence of establishing a standing army.\"\n \n He explains:\n \"What havoc, desolation, and destruction, have been perpetrated by standing armies! An instance within the memory of some of this house will show us how our militia may be destroyed. Forty years ago, when the resolution of enslaving America was formed in Great Britain, the British Parliament was advised by an artful man,* who was governor of Pennsylvania, to disarm the people; that it was the best and most effectual way to enslave them; but that they should not do it openly, but weaken them, and let them sink gradually, by totally disusing and neglecting the militia.\"\n \n Anti-federalists had also worried that the federal government would try to make militia service as unpleasant as possible so that no would want to participate in the militia:\n \"They may effect the destruction of the militia, by rendering the service odious to the people themselves, by harassing them from one end of the continent to the other, and by keeping them under martial law.\"\n \n So I don't think the fear was so much that the government would go from door to door collecting people's guns. The fear was that the people would be disarmed by government neglect of the militia. As the founders understood it, government had to take a proactive role in passing and enforcing militia regulations in order to keep the people well armed and militarily prepared. Fearing federal neglect of the militia, both Henry and Mason wanted an explicit recognition of a state power to arm the militia in the Constitution. Madison's response was that there was nothing in the Constitution that prohibited the states from arming their own militias and besides the states had neglected their own militias in the past:\n \"I cannot conceive that this Constitution, by giving the general government the power of arming the militia, takes it away from the state governments. The power is concurrent, and not exclusive. Have we not found, from experience, that, while the power of arming and governing the militia has been solely vested in the state legislatures, they were neglected and rendered unfit for immediate service? Every state neglected too much this most essential object.\"\n (quotes taken from Elliot's Debates --Saturday, June 14, 1788.)\n Search: A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation\n \n In the end, anti-federalists such as Mason and Henry did not get their way. Instead of recognizing a right of the states to arm the militia, the Second Amendment really represented a commitment by the federal government to not let the militia atrophy and become militarily ineffective due to neglect. The amendment did not take away from Congress' power over the militia as pointed out in a brief filed in Heller:\n \n \"The amendment, as revised, would still assauge Anti-Federalist concerns by stating a principled commitment to the value of a militia. But it would not hinder Congress in using its best judgement to determine how to organize, arm, and discipline an effective militia.\"\n http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/pdfs/07-08/07-290_PetitionerAmCuRakove.pdf\n \n A concern for owning a gun to defend one's home against a burglar, for example, did not seem to play much of a part in the controversy that surrounded the Second Amendment. Personal self-defense against crime was an area already covered by common law which originated in England and thus did not need to be addressed by statutory law.\n\n \n See David hardy's article in which he provides timelines for drafting of proposals for Bill of Rights from Virginia anti-federalists.(see pages 76 -80 especially)\n http://www.cardozolawreview.com/content/denovo/HARDY_2010_61.pdf\n \n The PA Minority also offered two provisions, one for an unambiguously individual right and another that the state could arm/train militia if Congress neglected.\n \n The historians Justice Breyer relies on are unreliable, they present here a selective history, as if the VA and PA anti-federalists only offered proposals on state control of militia. \n \n \n A false dichotomy:\n \"So I don't think the fear was so much that the government would go from door to door collecting people's guns. The fear was that the people would be disarmed by government neglect of the militia.\"\n \n Why then did both the VA and PA anti-fedralists offer proposals on each concern(individual in one provision and state control over militia in other)?",

Breyer, like Lincoln, examines the attitudes and intentions of the Founding Fathers. He comes to the conclusion that they didn't oppose the regulation of guns.\n\n \n Your latest opinion seems to ignore what Bryan had said previously regarding the opinion of Justice Breyer and the historians he cites to form his opinion. So rather than a simple rehash of what was said and subsequently ignored I'm going to put forth his response because I feel it's still viable and entirely relevant.\n \n \nInteresting article, Galileo. I don't know if Breyer takes his inspiration for a collective-militia-only right from Rakove, but the article's author-fellow academic Mr. Leibiger-seems to draw a different conclusion. He takes Rakove to task for, in his opinion, missing the point: \n \n But overall, Rakove maintains, Madison still saw a bill of rights as useless, and only backed it as \"a tub to the whale,\" or a sop to the Anti-Federalists. But perhaps Rakove underestimates the extent to which the Virginian's support of rights-related amendments was principled and theoretical as well as political, especially if we look at the bill of rights he wanted rather than the one he got.6 For Madison, a bill of rights provided a second chance for his pet project: to obtain the congressional veto of state laws that he had tried, but failed, to achieve at the 1787 Convention. If a bill of rights could be made to apply not only to the federal government, but to the states as well, it would be almost as good as the congressional veto.\n \n Doesn't this quote from the article suggest that Madison did not feel the BoR was useless, but instead was viewed as another way to achieve some grand design? The article (citing Rakove for inspiration) suggests Madison feared tyranny more from a state government than a federal one: \n \n Rakove shows how Madison developed a variety of political concepts to solve the problem of majority tyranny. Turning conventional wisdom on its head, Madison argued - first in his 1787 essay \"Vices of the Political System of the United States,\" and later in his famous Federalist 10 - that liberty would be safer in a large Republic (the size of the United States) than in a small republic (the size of a state). There would be such a multiplicity of interests in a large republic that no single self-interested faction would be able to forge a tyrannical majority. Instead, various interests would cancel each other out, allowing the public good and minority rights to prevail. An extended republic, moreover, would enjoy the benefits of a \"filtration of talent,\" as larger electoral districts would result in the election of wiser and more far-sighed leaders than the narrowminded men who found their way into the state legislatures.\n \n The rest of the article strongly suggests that Madison's aim throughout the Amendment process was to limit the tyrannical power of the smaller legislative majorities in the states. To re-quote the article's speculation:\n \n For Madison, a bill of rights provided a second chance for his pet project: to obtain the congressional veto of state laws that he had tried, but failed, to achieve at the 1787 Convention. If a bill of rights could be made to apply not only to the federal government, but to the states as well, it would be almost as good as the congressional veto.\n \n To me, this fellow academic's reading of Rakove does not offer any support for the \"state's right\" or \"militia only\" view of the 2nd. Amendment. If the above arguments about Madison's intentions are true, then Madison certainly does not write the 2nd. Amendment with the aim of limiting the \"right of the people\" to only empowering the very states whose power he wishes to limit to arm militias which they could then use to enforce the tyranny of a legislative majority....\n \n Wouldn't a more proper reading of this argument be: If Madison had in mind to limit the state's ability to oppress their people, then doesn't he really mean \"the right of the people\" and not \"the right of the states\" when he wrote \"the write of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed\"-that neither the federal nor a state legislative majority should be allowed to infringe upon the people's right to have individual arms to protect themselves from the tyranny of either?\n \n In any event, the article you cite leads me to wonder how Madison would have viewed the 14th. Amendment if he had lived long enough to see it..... \n \n Turning to the self-defense case. At first glance, before I read the Cornell article, I admit it was tempting to argue that one case is a very small cherry pulled from a much larger tree, and that one case involving a couple of trial dog lawyers does not a quorum make. However, Cornell does argue that this case involved the \"leading legal minds of the day,\" and I have no reason to dispute this. So I looked into the actual arguments Cornell cited. Having done so it is my opinion-agree or disagree as you will-that Cornell completely misses the legal issue, and that when properly understood it does not support his case. \n \n I would first note that this case does not address the 2nd. Amendment at all, for it was unquestioned at that time (the suppositions about Madison's views in the article cited above notwithstanding) the BoR applied exclusively as a bar to federal action, while this was a state court prosecution involving state laws. Therefore, it was only the Pennsylvania Constitution's RKBA provision which was potentially an issue. Nevertheless, I believe Cornell tries to use this case as a cutting out expedition to divorce the Pennsylvania RKBA provision from the individual right of armed self-defense-no doubt with an aim to later making a similar claim against the 2nd. Amendment. \n \n But here is where I believe Cornell displays his lack of understanding of legal arguments....Cornell argues that \"nether side believed that the use of a gun for personal self defense had any connection to the constitutional right to bear arms protected by the Pennsylvania Constitution.\" Now I have not read the transcript, and so admittedly Cornell has me at a disadvantage-I must rely entirely on the information he cites for his claim. Yet as far as I can see he arrives at this conclusion not by any direct evidence-no quotations from the transcript, for example. Rather, he argues in the negative-the transcript apparently shows that neither side argued over the wording of the RKBA provision, but they instead focused a great deal of time on their arguments over the proper scope of the common law right of self-defense. In my opinion Cornell clearly wants us to believe that the reason why the RKBA provision was not debated was because it must have nothing at all to do with private self-defense. \n \n But let me put the actual wording of the Pennsylvania RKBA provision (as adopted on August 16, 1776) to a more candid audience: \n \n That the people have a right to bear arms for the defense of themselves and the state; And as standing armies in the time of peace are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be kept up; And that the military should be kept under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power. (emphasis added by me)\n \n Can anyone here argue with a straight face that the highlighted language does not recognize a right of individual self-defense? Yet Cornell would have us believe that not just a first year law student but the \"leading legal minds of the day\" would miss the obvious argument-that the words \"the people have a right to bear arms for the defense of themselves\" meant their client had a constitutional right to act in self-defense?\n \n Come back to the case Cornell cites. The argument is not made because it was not required to be made. If the prosecution had argued that the defendant had no right to act in self-defense at all, then the \"leading legal minds of the day\" representing the defendant would have had to argue the obvious-the RKBA provision enshrines this very right. From what I can see they never had to cite the RKBA provision to make this argument because the prosecution conceded that the defendant had a right to act in self-defense. When you look at the arguments that Cornell cites from both sides, the issue is clearly not whether the defendant had a right to act in self-defense but whether his claim to have acted in self-defense was justified. Cornell glosses over this fact. \n \n Cornell's supposition is also flawed because, in my opinion, it flows from a basic misunderstanding of the link between the common law right of self-defense and the RKBA provision. In my opinion he believes they are totally separate entities. But notice the RKBA provision only says \"defense of themselves.\" It does not define what the right of self-defense is. It does not tell us, for example, under what circumstances the exercise of the right is justified, and under what circumstances it is not. \n \n This is because it does not need to. And here is where Cornell demonstrates his fatal misunderstanding. He believes the RKBA provision created a separate right, and that the failure to claim this separate right means the defense team felt it did not create an individual right at all. But the Pennsylvania RKBA provision did not create a new and separate right, it only recognized and protected the common law right of armed self-defense that pre-existed the Pennsylvania Constitution which the defendant did claim-the very right the prosecution concedes when both sides argue what the scope of this right really is. Cornell fails to understand this, and so he fails to understand why the argument over the meaning of the RKBA provision did not take place. \n \n And so my opinion is the lack of argument over the RKBA provision flows from an acknowledgement that there is no argument to make. And this happens far more often than you might think. For example, every case that involves a suppression hearing on a claim that evidence was seized in violation of the 4th. Amendment involves the threshold question of whether the person seeking to suppress the evidence had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the place searched or the thing seized. For example, none of you live with me, and none of you has a right to complain that evidence was seized illegally from my house. But in almost every case this issue of who can make the 4th. Amendment violation claim is conceded up front. If, for example, drugs are seized from a car at a traffic stop, then we never waste time arguing that the owner/driver did or did not have an expectation of privacy in the contents of his car. We concede that issue and move on to the real issue-it is not about whether he had a 4th. Amendment right of privacy in the car, but whether the search of his car violated that right. \n \n Cornell's lack of citing any argument to the contrary shows that the same is true in the case he mentions. The RKBA provision tells us that the defendant had a right to possess a firearm for the purpose of being prepared for armed self-defense. It also tells us that he had a right to use the firearm in armed self-defense. But these were not issues in the case. The question in this case is not whether he had a right to possess the firearm or even that he had a right to use it in self-defense. The question was whether he was really acting in self-defense. \n \n And that, as the lawyers correctly argued in the case Cornell cites, is a matter of interpreting the nature and the scope of the common law right the RKBA provision protects. In exercising this protected right did the defendant have to retreat to the wall, or could he stand his ground before using or threatening the use of deadly force? Did the nature of the harm to him rise to a level that justified the use or threat of deadly force? These are all questions that are not answered by looking at the RKBA provision but by searching out the parameters of the common law right the RKBA provision protects. It is little wonder then that the \"leading legal minds of the day\" confined their arguments to the actual issue in the case, and it should not come as a surprise to an unbiased historian that an RKBA provision which was never an issue was not discussed. \n \n But of course I am no recognized historian, and my biases for gun rights are admittedly well documented on this blog cite. I will say in my favor that I have far more experience in actually arguing the common law right of self-defense before a court than Cornell does. It is up to the reader to act as judge and determine which of us has the better argument....\n",

For shame.\n \n Your latest opinion seems to ignore what Bryan had said previously regarding the opinion of Justice Breyer and the historians he cites to form his opinion. So rather than a simple rehash of what was said and subsequently ignored I'm going to put forth his response because I feel it's still viable and entirely relevant.\n\n If you don't have the debating skills to address the actual point I made instead of resorting to massive copying and pasting of what someone else wrote then maybe you shouldn't be posting.",

   "Humm. What puts this fantasy to bed is the 14th Amendment. Do you think the esteemed Justice knows that the 14th. was proposed, passed and ratified? \n \n Umm, Galileo. Alan Dershowitz has something to say to you. \n   The Second Amendment strikes back  \n Even some noted liberal professors admit the obvious. Harvard's Laurence Tribe says, \"The Fourteenth Amendment, which makes parts of the Bill of Rights applicable to the states, reflected a broad agreement that bearing arms was a 'privilege' of each citizen.\" Fellow Harvard liberal law professor Alan Dershowitz agrees, and scolds fellow liberals for twisting the words of the Second Amendment in a way that could come back to haunt them. \"Foolish liberals who are trying to read the Second Amendment out of the Constitution by claiming that it's not an individual right or that it's too much of a safety hazard,\" said Dershowitz, \"don't see the danger of the big picture.\" He added, \"They're courting disaster by encouraging others to use the same means to eliminate portions of the Constitution they don't like.\"\n",

   "If you don't have the debating skills to address the actual point I made instead of resorting to massive copying and pasting of what someone else wrote then maybe you shouldn't be posting.\n\n \n You call into question my debating skills, when I've posted a number of opinions to counter what you put forth? And then you accuse me of copying and pasting, when this is a technique that you seem to favor? If you'd like I can provide a number of examples where you've made heavy use of copying and pasting.\n \n I'm very capable of countering whatever you choose to put forth. I even cite relevant counter points to show fallacy.\n \n You compared Justice Breyer and his dissent of Heller, to President Lincoln and his ending slavery. I find this comparison highly distasteful. The actions of President Lincoln extended freedom and rights and the protection of the Constitution to those who used to be slaves and regarded as property. The actions of Justice Breyer were an attempt to restrict the freedom and rights of Americans and runs counter to the actions of President Lincoln.\n \n Another reason I chose to quote Bryan is that he adequately addresses the shortcomings of Justice Breyer and the historians he cites, poking holes in the theory that the Founding Fathers were somehow pro-gun control.\n \n If you have something other than the words of a liberal justice to support your opinion, something of substantial weight and historical value then I'd like to see if. Were there any gun control regulations enacted to law by the Founding Fathers that restricted the extent of the ability of the people to keep and bear arms?\n \n I'm well aware of your earlier citing of various \"loyalty oaths\" by various state governments, but such examples do not amount to the actions of the Founding Fathers. Only federal actions will count in this matter since they were originally the only ones bound by the Constitution.",

   "Breyer reminds me of Lincoln. Southerners argued that federal interference in the slavery issue was a violation of the Tenth Amendment. Lincoln responded by arguing that the Founding Fathers (at least most of them) were not pro-slavery. Pro-gun activists argue that gun-control violates the Second Amendment. Breyer, like Lincoln, examines the attitudes and intentions of the Founding Fathers. He comes to the conclusion that they didn't oppose the regulation of guns.\nand the southerners were correct and thus the 13th amendment. Even Lincoln knew this. \n \n I really holp Breyer isn't like Lincoln...he should, instead, be like a judge..not a president.",
