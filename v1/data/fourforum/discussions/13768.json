   "Portugal's Parliament Approves Gay Marriage\nLISBON, Portugal - Portugal's Parliament passed a bill Friday allowing gay marriage in the mostly Roman Catholic country.\n \n The Socialist government's bill won the support of all left-of-center parties. Right-of-center parties opposed the change and sought a national referendum on the issue, but their proposal was rejected.\n \n Voting figures were not immediately available but the President of Parliament Jaime Gama announced that the government's bill had passed, as was widely expected.\n \n The proposed law goes to Portugal's conservative President Anibal Cavaco Silva who can ratify or veto. The veto can be overturned by the parliament.\n \n If there is no presidential veto, the first gay marriage ceremonies could take place in April - a month before Pope Benedict XVI is due on an official visit to Portugal.\n \n Its approval would make Portugal the sixth European country to allow same-sex marriages. Gay marriage is currently permitted in Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Norway.\n \n \"This law rights a wrong,\" Prime Minister Jose Socrates said in a speech to lawmakers, adding that it \"simply ends pointless suffering.\"\n \n The bill removes a reference in the current law to marriage being between two people of different sexes.\n",
