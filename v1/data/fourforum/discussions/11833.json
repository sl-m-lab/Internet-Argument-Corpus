   "So what would that say about people who spend a lot more advertising for a god that probably doesn't exist?\n\n \n Iuris, think about it for just a minute. You may think that God probably doesn't exist, but that has nothing to do with the people who promote God because you can be sure that they DO believe He exists. If they don't believe in God's existence, yet are out promoting Him, I would say they are equally as stupid as these atheists who believe that God PROBABLY doesn't exist, yet they are advertising against an allegedly non-existent God. And what is most incredible, is that they aren't even sure that God doesn't exist! You have to admit it, they epitomize stupidity... emoticon_xdonno emoticon_wow \n \n Let me give you an example to clarify how ignorant and irrational their thinking is. As atheists who don't believe in God, you can be certain that neither do they believe in satan or demons. So why not buy ad time on busses declaring that demons don't exist? Does it make sense at all to advertise that something or someone doesn't exist? Why are they declaring war on, or even wasting time thinking about a non-existent being at all if He doesn't exist? \n \n Atheists constantly argue how concerned for, and committed to this world they are, and making it a better place for all people. Yet rather than spend this money on helping the poor and homeless in this difficult economic time, they see fit to run an ad campaign against an allegedly non-existent being whom they can only say at best, PROBABLY DOESN'T EXIST. emoticon_frazzled Go on Iuris, you JUSTIFY that rationale, cuz I can't.",

   "\"Probably doesn't exist\" is a sign of intellectual honesty, Archie. You should try it sometime.\n\n \n What is intellectually honest about promoting an anti-God campaign when they aren't really sure at all that God doesn't exist? That type of person is promoting an anti \"God delusion.\" Oh wait, that's the title of Dawkins book, isn't it.\n \n \nIt's notable that Dawkins wanted it replaced by \"Almost certainly doesn't exist\". \n\n \n What's the difference? \"Probably doesn't,\" \"almost certainly doesn't exist.\" Both show that they are promoting a concept they can't prove and aren't even sure is true since they are admitting that He might exist in spite of their protests. It is irrational and stupid to spend money promoting against an allegedly non existent God. Is that so hard for you atheists to grasp? \n \n \nAlso, I have slightly more up-to-date info. The Atheist campaign is currently almost up to \u00a3100,000 without Dawkins' help, it got to the initial total in under a day and is still skyrocketing. An interesting compare/contrast is the Alpha campaign.\n\n \n Then this just confirms how much larger the mass ignorance is than first believed. To waste a 100,000 pounds advertising that a supposedly non-existent God doesn't exist is a complete waste of money. I mean, if God really doesn't exist, is spending this 100 grand making him exist even less? Of course not. It's an exercise in futility whether the premise is correct or not.\n \n As for the alpha campaign, again, so what? We all know that only 5% of Brits are people of faith today, and that true faith in Christ is a thing of the past and shrinking more every year in Godless Europe. You may wear that fact as a badge of honor, but for me it's a sign of the end times. Now let's just hang around and see which of us is correct in our beliefs.",
