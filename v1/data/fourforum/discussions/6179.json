   "An interesting commentary on internal political strife in Iraq between Shia, Sunni and Kurd factions. The old adage of follow the money for motivation, in this case oil, is becoming more pronounced as Iraq is pushed to define its constitutional issues and resolutions: \n \n http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0811/p09s02-coop.html \n \n At $66/bbl, oil is the big player in Iraqi politics. That the constitution will embrace Sharia Law and forge ties further ties with Iran is a given. Whether or not Iraq will explode into full civil war before the US can eliminate Sunni resistance and ensure Kurd autonomy are big questions. We (US) sure know how to create a mess in other countries.",

A Gulf of Tonkin type of incident on a domestic basis would put any such plan in play. Emergency legislation to put 6% of all withholding taxes into 'private' equity market retirement accounts or more likely government securities would temporarily solve some of the initial cash flow issue under a believe in America banner. It would refocus the US public from Iraq and make oil really expensive. \n \n Putting on the other shoe, such an action would make Bin Laden seem like a prophet to many in the Islamic fold. It would reinforce a widespread belief that US aggression towards Islam is unlimited in scope while pushing the US towards eventual fiscal insolvency.",
