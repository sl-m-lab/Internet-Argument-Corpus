He did cause the death of every human other than Noah and the people on the ark, and besides, disobeying His own commandments is not a very good example He's setting for us\n\n God has both endorsed and commanded genocide in the bible. he usually instructs the armies of his chosen people to completely wipe tribes off the face of the earth. dont even leave women or children, and dont make children with the women either. genocide is a long time m.o. of the jewish/christian God <-- bootfitter, check this out :p\n \nWhy does God care about mankind?\n\n the reason is identical to the answer for \"why would a father care about his children?\"\n \nIf God is perfect in every aspect, how can it make imperfect creations?\n\n he didnt, he made perfect creations. the ability in something to be imperfect is not an imperfection in itself.\n \n i have a strong suspicion that your more interested in the reactions to the questions than the answers",

   "This is a bit of a shotgun reply to many but here it goes. First, from the christian point of view, God determines what is right and wrong because God is! He is right He is love He is! That means if God determines that all the earth should be destroyed at the time of Noah then it must be the right thing. \n \n God does not \"control\" time as much as God is outside of time and created it.\n \n God is not evil, by definition He is good. Therefore all he does is good.\n \n To say \"if god is so good then how come he allows evil\" sets you up as the one who gets to determine good and evil (note the story of the fruit of the tree of the 'knowledge of good and evil') and therefore you declare yourself to be god (by definition). If one accepts the definition of God as the christian god (and the author of this thread did when he said he wanted information about the christian god) then one must begin with those assumptions to discuss the items you wish to discuss.\n \n Conflicts occur because of differences of religion for all religion including hinduism, islam, christianity, judaism etc. Look at Bosnia, Iraq, india and pakistan, china and japan (wwII) etc.\n \n The term perfect, as used in the bible, frequently means \"made complete\". God is the only one who is perfect. He created man, perfect (or complete) and with a free will. Man could choose an error free life or one with errors. He chose errors. The allowance of this is perfect (as in perfect) in that it allows for the demonstration of love. If we were made without need (flaws) then there would be no need of God. God created man in order to love man. Not that man could be God.\n \n This is a good thing. If man were God, what problems would we have.\n \n The proof of imperfection is to take a simple inventory of the world, murder, war, theft, it is quite prevalent. The proof of the existence of a \"sin nature\" is the fact that we sin. It is not our sinning that causes us to have a sin nature but rather our sin nature that causes us to sin.\n \n Well, that should be quite enough fodder for many.\n \n EF",

If, in fact, the universe had a beginning (which seems to be the case), then one can postulate a state change between no universe (call it \"time = T-1\") and a universe (call it \"time =T0\"). In order for such a state change to have occured ('no universe' to 'universe') there would have had to have been a prior state of 'no universe' (T-1).

And a stab in the dark is not going to do very much for my pride, so any faith I have is based off of, at the very least, some sort of logical evidence.

   "lol, i didnt answer the question because it was leading off into a tangent away from the topic. thats why i said it has nothing to do with god's justice (which it really doesnt). you asked how god could be a merciful god if he expects killings (sacrifices) as appeasement. easyrider responded with the parable of forgiveness, and you responded with the question of throwing people in prison as a form of justice. i didnt want to further derail the topic\n \n anyway, to answer your question, throwing someone in jail then serves the same purpose as it does today: punishment. usually, if someone was thrown in prison for not being able to repay a debt (very common back then), that person would \"repay\" the debt in labor for a certain amount of time equivalent to the wages he would need to make to pay the sum. during this time, he was essentially a slave or prisoner (also referred to as a bondservant) of the person he was indebted to\n \n in many instances where the bible refers to slavery (such as, slaves obey your masters), it would likely be referring to a situation like this\n \n anyway, thats how the debt would be paid off\n\n \n \n If gods justice is.. prison and tourture.. can't we use this information in forming an idea about who god is and how god acts? I didn't lose track of the question ,.. I just didn't get an answer for it! So I just moved on with the next dance around the first question .. still waiting for it to be answered also. Throwing people in prison and tourturing them was what was included in that dance and it sortta raised the same question again .. Is this god really just?\n \n You forgot the tourture part ,.. I don't have a problem with just \" jail \" it's the tourture part that disturbes me. Thats great they had a way for you to make the payments while there ,... It's just too bad ya gotta put up with the tourture too!! Tourture for any reason is just not a good thing for a diety of grace and justice to be getting into,... This is just my opinion.\n \n Are we going to bring slavery into this thing also? ... Because I have a strong objection to slavery also. \n \n Paid with tourture?

I apologize for sounding condescending. It is not my intention, it is just that the words are as descriptive as I can be and are intended as descriptors not judgements. I hold nothing against you whatsoever.\n \n as to #5, God values love. He does ask us to be submissive. The reason is that he loves us and knows what is best for us, far more than we do. Our submission (the greek word for this in the new testament means \"to come under the influence of another\" and is used in non scripture most often of a soldier submitting to the officer in charge.) is not to a code of rules but rather to a person who cares for us. Much like an obedient child is submissive to their parents not because they are supposed to be but because the child trusts the parent.\n \n The killing, the sacrifice, is because of who God is in nature. He is holy and just and merciful and gracious, and love. God is good, good is God. God cannot abide evil (sin). There must be a payment. The payment is death. In Genesis the conditions are established with \"on the day you eat of it you shall surely die\". The sin resulted in man trying to be like God knowing good and evil. By the way, declaring something good or evil IS the definition of Judgement, which is intended for God alone. \n \n Humans are to be discerning, but we are not ever to condemn. I find EZ's style to be condemning and hindering true exchange of info.\n \n Back to genesis, the disobedience of man at the time brought death into the world. It is not God that brought it in, but man. God stepped into it in the person of Jesus so that death would no longer reign. God didn't break the lamp, man did, God still paid the price. God had to make for the possiblity of good or evil. If there was only the possiblity of Good then God only gets compliance as man has no choice. Love requires a choice exist. God gave man the chance to love or to not love. Love leads to life, not leads to death. That is the very nature of love.\n \n Do not consider it physical death, but death of the true self. These bodies are only a part of it. We are eternal creatures. Our physical life is only about 80 years.\n \n That is why.",

   " (To Epaphras Faith) but I do appreiciate you not being too insulting,.. or reminding me I'm gonna burn in hell like EZ!\n\n \n Let's see.... You are the one who said you didn't want to go to heaven. I reminded you there was only one other place people go when they die (which is hell), and then I said, \"I hope you will reconsider\". That's condemning you to hell? \n \n Maybe someday Epaphras Faith will have enough moxy to tell you what will happen to you if you keep rejecting Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins. But I doubt he will do that. He wants to be everyone's buddy and be friends with the world. John the Baptist would have told you. The Apostle John would probably have told you (John 3:36, etc.). \n \n I'd like to see what Epaphras Faith would tell you about this. Go ahead and ask him the following question, \"According to the Bible (John 3:36, Acts 4:12, etc.) what will happen to me when I die if I finally reject Jesus Christ as my savior for the remission of my sins? Where will I most likely wind up - heaven or hell?\"\n \n Or maybe I'll ask EF myself: EF, according to the Bible (John 3:36, Acts 4:12, etc.) what will happen to Johnson when he dies if he finally rejects Jesus Christ as his savior for the remission of my sins?",

I can tell this, because you show no compassion. The bible does not say, anywhere, if you reject Jesus you will go to hell. However, It does say that he who rejects the son will suffer where there is waling and gnashing of teeth. It also says that the only way to God is through Jesus Christ. It also says that the only way to Christ is through the hearing of the word. It also says that we have not been given a spirit of fear again leading to slavery. Yet you continue to traffic in fear. \n \n It is not I who lack moxy. You condemn people with your words and drive them from God. I think the people in hell will surprise you as will those that are in heaven. \n \n Do not suppose that your preaching and working in soup kitchens will earn you God's good favor. It will not. That is not \"through Jesus\" but through your own deeds. No man comes to the father that way.\n \n I have had enough of your baiting and your insults. Please address me no further. I know who my God is. I know His nature well. You would do well spending more time getting to know Him than to spend it harrassing others.\n \n If you address me or insult me again, I shall report your posts and will go on reporting them until something is done. May you find Mercy and Rest.\n \n EF\n \n Good day",
