We are still friends today and I am 35 as of yesterday. It passes. Be honest, communicate your feelings in honest ways using \"I\" statements. example:\n \"I\" feel you might be readin into this and \"I\" want us to talk about things. \"I\" am straight. \"I\" feel like you are hoping \"I\" am gay and \"I\" am not.\n \n It's hard to come out to friends and puts one in an wierd place. Stand your ground, be you, talk him through it, when he needs to talk. \n \n Who cares if people think you are gay, it doesn't really matter what others think. You know the truth and that is all that counts. Think how he feels when people know he is gay. It can be fearful at times. I would be happy to answer any question or anything that could help you!",

Also, he is a year older than me, and much bigger, and when I first came to the school he protected me from the bullies, so I guess I owe him. \n \n He didn't make a big deal about it either, he just said that because we were best mates, he wanted me to know. \n \n I am only a little scared that if I tell him that I like him also, (which I do,) he might expect me to do things with him. I don't think I can do that, and then we would not be friends any more. And I don't want that to happen.\n \n But I would never stop hanging out with him just cos of what others think. Whatever happens he has been a good mate for all my time at school. My mum likes him, and she approves of our friendship, (and you wouldn't believe how bossy and picky my mum can be!) and he stays at our place during the Christmas hols. \n \n I want to talk to him about being gay, cos I don't really understand how he can fancy another guy, but I am scared of offending him. If I tell him I don't understand it, it makes him sound like a freak or something. I think it must be terrible for him to be different from everyone else. \n \n But there is a funny side to this. When we go into town together, all the chicks are falling over him, and they never give me a second look. LOL!\n \n I tried chatting up one of the hotties who was hanging out with him, and all she said was, \"Does your mother know you are out this late!\" The cow! emoticon_rolleyes \n \n Oh - nearly forgot!

   "I think the problem with your genetics claim here is that you are trying to prove a genetic link to behavior. There is no evidence to claim sexual orientation is a behavior trait. That is like claiming what flavoe ice cream attracts you is also a behavior. Behavior requires action. Sexual oreintation does not. You don't have to have sex with the same sex to be gay. YOu have to be primarily attracted to the same sex. \n \n You are barking up the wrong tree! Looking for a genetic link to sexual orientation is different from looking for a genetic link to behavior. Sexual oreintation is not a behavior.\n\n there has never been proof that genetics control, or even influence, preference and taste. rather, all evidence supports the notion that preference and taste is acquired. for instance, are black people genetically predisposed to hip-hop music? are italian people genetically predisposed to tomato-based sauces? are the japanese genetically predisposed to electronic gadgets? all these \"preferences\" are shown to be a result of the environment in which these people live and learn in. a white person can learn to like hip-hop music, a japanese person can learn to like american football.\n \n i cannot think of a single case of someone's preference that was beyond the control of that person. how is homosexuality different?",

I think the root of this debate is really this: whether or not homosexuality is defined by actions or by nature. If it is a nature issue, then we can't really call that 'choosing.' If being gay is about what a person does, then choice can definitely come into play. I think a lot of people think of homosexuality in terms of what some people do: pursue relationships with people of the same gender. I think the gay lobby has spent a lot of time and resources trying to make the issue about nature. To some extent they've been successful. But still, to a lot of people, if a person goes his whole life without pursuing gay relationships, then for all practical purposes he or she is not gay.",

The point is, it just seems to me that trying to neatly catagorize people into such 'boxes' doesn't really work. We don't know all that much about this concept of supposed \"sexual orientation\" anyway.\n\n \n \n I think there's a difference between acting on feelings and just feelings alone.\n And no, there are no difinative divisions. I think much of seuxality is fluid. Not all, but much. \n Sexuality, sexual orientation, sexual identity and sex (the act of) are not all the same thing. They are connected, but not identical by means of action, attraction, availability and acceptence (both of a person's self or of others).",

   "it is extremely difficult to find unbiased articles about the origin and causes of homosexuality on the internet. again, mr write, i appreciate the article. i was looking at this one from family research institute. it may be a christian based institute, because it doesnt have any articles that promote homosexuality. then again, i typed \"gay\" in the new scientist search field and got nothing but articles favoring homosexuality. what can i say...\n \n anyway, the article i linked above takes a look at all the approaches and theories about the cause of homosexuality. in my view, i think it does an ok job of sticking to the data and supporting all its statements. it concludes that homosexuality seems most likely to be a personality trait that is learned, not inherited\n\n \n Paul Cameron, who wrote the article (founder of the Family Research Institute), has been shown to make obvious misrepresentations of data...\n \n Second, this Court reaffirms its findings that Dr. Simon and Dr. Marmor were\n very credible witnesses and that their qualifications were impeccable. In\n contrast, Dr. Paul Cameron--the basis of the claim that Drs. Simon and Marmor\n committed fraud in their testimony--has himself made misrepresentations to this\n Court. For example:\n \n (i) his sworn statement that \"homosexuals are approximately 43 times more apt\n to commit crimes than is the general population\" is a total distortion of the\n Kinsey data upon which he relies--which, as is obvious to anyone who reads the\n report, concerns data from a non-representative sample of delinquent homosexuals\n (and Dr. Cameron compares this group to college and non-college heterosexuals);\n \n (ii) his sworn statement that \"homosexuals abuse children at a\n proportionately greater incident than do heterosexuals\" is based upon the same\n distorted data--and, the Court notes, is directly contrary to other evidence\n presented at trial besides the testimony of Dr. Simon and Dr. Marmour.

TAMU has simply not proven that recognition will indeed imminently\n result in such dire consequences. The speculative evidence offered by the\n defendants' experts [including Dr. Paul Cameron] 'for which no historical or\n empirical basis is disclosed, ' cannot justify TAMU's content-based refusal to\n recognize GSS. Gay Lib, supra, 558 F.2d [848] at 854. We think that on this\n record TAMU's public health argument is precisely the kind of 'undifferentiated\n fear or apprehension ' that the Supreme Court has repeatedly held 'is not enough\n to overcome the right to freedom of expression.

You either are attracted to your own sex or you're not, and your propensity to do so or not is hard-wired from an early age if not in the womb, whether from one gene, many genes, pre-natal hormones, or something we don't yet know of. But one thing we definitely know it's not, is a conscious choice.\n \n Even if it were possible for a heterosexual man to choose  to find men sexually attractive, there would be no sense to it. Why would a guy suddenly say to himself, \"Heigh ho, I think I'll choose not to be interested in women anymore, though I find them sexually arousing, and get my jollies from men, who till this moment I never felt remotely that way about?\"",

Why does the simple fact that it's between people of the same sex make a beautiful act into a sin apparently more heinous than murder (we allow convicted murderers to marry, after all).\n \n Is that simple enough for you?\n \n By the way, there are many same-sex, loving kisses described in the Bible... none of which are condemned in any way.

You don't choose what you're predisposed to like or dislike. That's what the word \"homosexuality\" means, the motivating attraction, the desire to perform the behavior, not the behavior itself.\n\n the problem with \"urges\" is that we can internally turn them on or off. we can supress our urges and even make them disappear. we can also create and nuture urges that we never originally had\n \n 1. jim went to public school as a child and learned to be tough and aggressive in order to not get picked on by bullies. as a result he had a very short temper. however, as he finished school and got a job, he had to quickly learn that a short fuse is not tolerated in his workplace. it took him a lot of conscious effort, practice, reading and consel, but after a while jim could easily manage his anger problem and became a patient and cooperative worker.\n \n 2. beth fell in love with her highschool sweetheart, harry. for years they dated, then started living together. harry never suggested marraige, and beth never brought it up. gradually, harry because more comfortable with the status quo, and became abusive to beth and eventually violent. due to beth's submissive personality she remained in the relatinship and lived in fear and seclusion. one day, she discovered that harry was cheating on her, and she decided she'd had enough. she started secretly taking self-help classes and mustered up the courage to one day stand up to harry, confront him about his affair and leave the relationship. now beth is a counsellor for women that go through what she went through\n \n there is nothing innate about urges. when we're conditioned a particular way we tend to follow our urges. but urges are not permanent. they are learned and dropped, and their strength and influence over our decisions can be controlled",

   "Heterosexuals may not have same gender sexual relations on the most part, but there are those who do. I'm not talking about bi-sexuals at all. I'm talking about those who identify as heterosexuals. Pornstars are the first group of such individuals who come to mind. Many male and female \"gay/lesbian\" pornstars are in real life, heterosexuals. Their \"on screen\" activities are simply part of their job. \n Another group are Pre or non-operative transexuals with opposite gender identifying partners. On the inside, in their heart and soul they are not what their bodies display. They are the opposite gender and their partners are opposite gender to that. \n A good friend of mine, a male to female transgender, whom I have known for several years, both pre and post opperative, has always known herself to be female. She almost never lived as a male. Her parents were probably the only such parents who are as accepting of who she is and has always been. They allowed her to live female. It wasn't until she met someone whom she wanted to spend the rest of her life with that she finally was able to have the courage to correct the outward birth defect she was born with. \n Are you saying she isn't a woman? Or that she never was? \n I just can't buy that.\n\n \n Hmm . . . .\n \n Ok, I can accept that. The only thing is that I don't think sex between porn stars really qualifies for this discussion, because such sex is probably for profit and has nothing to do with attraction or a relationship of any kind. In other words, it is unlikely a straight porn star would seek out such activity with a same gender person outside of his industry and making money.\n \n The transgender issue is a stronger point.",
