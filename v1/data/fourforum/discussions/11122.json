   "It is a positive scandal! Over a week 28,000 bags, placed in temporary storage at Heathrow's Terminal 5, cannot be returned to their owners! Moreover, Aviation Minister, Jim Fitzpatrick said that other 20,000 bags need \"reprocessing and rescreening\" before they can be loaded on to planes. It means that more flights (in addition to 250 ones, which were cancelled during T5 first four days) may be cancelled, too. \n To all seeming it is not enough for our British authorities that most passengers continue to suffer an unacceptable poor travel experience at the Heathrow airport! Now it is absolutely obvious for all of us that opening of the &#8356;4,3 bn Terminal 5 has fallen, echoing the chaos and confusion, prevailed in Brown's government authorities. In this case I cannot but agree with the opinion of our shadow home secretary, David Davis, who has rightly called the situation in this country \"a dreadful national embarrassment\"!",
