   "If anyone wonders why this needs to be looked at - clearly judges did not follow the law.\n \n Transcript of Delay interview - keypoints highlighted by Hawk \n \nHUME: You said today that, quote, \"The time will come for the men responsible for this to answer for their behavior, not today.\" What did you mean by that?\n \n DELAY: Well, there's a lot of questions that need to be answered. We need to look at this case. We need to look at the failure of the judiciary in Florida. We need to look at the failure of the judiciary on the federal level. The United States Congress, with the president's signing, sent a bill - made a law that gave the federal courts jurisdiction to look at this case all anew. And they didn't even follow procedures.\n \n The normal procedure would be to reconnect the feeding tube so that they could hear this case all anew.  The Congress, the people's representatives told the judiciary to do that. We need to look at all this.\n \n HUME: Well, to be specific about it, basically what you had - what you did is to authorize the judiciary to look at the matter afresh. Which means presumably with an evidentiary hearing, if the court chose to do that. The courts did not choose to do that.\n \n Is it absolutely clear to you, Congressman, that this was a violation of the law you passed? Or simply the court taking jurisdiction in the matter and deciding to uphold the lower courts?\n \n DELAY: Well, the House of Representatives has taken on judiciary activism for the last two years. I mean we passed six bills limiting their jurisdiction. We've looked at the makeup of their courts. We're taking responsibility for being the checks and balances on an overactive, out-of- control judiciary.\n \n And in this particular case, the judiciary was given an opportunity, the same opportunity that death row inmates have, to have one more court look at this. And rather than to look at process, look at all the evidence anew. They chose not to do that. They thumbed their nose at the Congress and at the Executive Branch. And we need to take a hard look at that\n \n HUME: You said, \"We will be looking at arrogant, out of control judiciary that thumbed their nose,\" as you indicated today. What can you imagine can be done, assuming this for the sake of discussion, that you're right about the judiciary. That it was acting in a way that it is arrogant and out of control, and unaccountable. What is it that you would propose to do?\n \n DELAY: What I would propose to do is ask the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives to take a good, hard, objective look at this, and what occurred. And then make recommendations to the House as to how to proceed\n \n HUME: Now, talk to me about your view on this case in particular. May I take it that your view is that Terri Schiavo should have been allowed to continue to live because she was not dying? Or what?\n \n DELAY: Terri Schiavo was a living human being, an innocent living human being. Brain damaged, yes. Incapacitated, yes. Disabled, yes. But she was a living human being. She was not being sustained on any artificial means - by any artificial means. All she was being done - all that was being done was she was fed through a tube instead of her throat.\n \n This system as failed as it is, this system allowed her to be starved to death. I just feel that that's very barbaric in our society.\n \n HUME: Would you have felt differently about it, and do you think as a matter of law it would have been different had her wishes in this regard been explicit and unmistakable?\n \n DELAY: Oh, it would have been totally different\n \n HUME: So, in other words, if she had left in writing a statement to the effect that if I ever reach the point where I'm in a vegetative state, unable to think and act on my own, that I don't wish to continue to live. Pulling the feeding tube in that instance with you would have been acceptable?\n \n DELAY: Well, no. Then you have to define what is a vegetative state. And that's one of the problems with this case. As the judge listening to different sides, listening to activists in the euthanasia movement, doctors that are activists in the euthanasia movement, decided on his own. One person decided that she was in a vegetative state, when others refuted that. So that is the question that needs to be answered.\n \n HUME: They refuted it or disputed it?\n \n DELAY: They disputed it\n \n HUME: Right, understood.\n \n DELAY: And that's why the Congress stepped in and said OK, let's have another person take a look at it as a federal judge, and take a look at al the evidence anew. And take a lot of question and new evidence that's been presented. Even if you have a living will, you have to make those kinds of determinations when the family is fighting amongst itself over wanting to take care of this living human being.\n \n HUME: All right. Congressman, thanks very much for joining us.\n \n DELAY: Thank you.\n",

   "If anyone wonders why this needs to be looked at - clearly judges did not follow the law.\n \n Transcript of Delay interview - keypoints highlighted by Hawk\n\n \n The problem with Delays little temper tantrum is that the judges DID follow the law. Just because congress gave a federal court the jurisdiction to look at something does not mean they must, nor does it mean they even CAN unless some cause can be shown. You do not just get unlimited appeals, regardless of whatever political grandstanding was going on.\n \n What Delay is essentially saying is that not only were all the Florida courts wrong, all the Federal courts that looked at it were as well, even the supreme court.\n \n \n What a load of bunk from a jackass who just supported passing a grossly unconstitutional law aimed at a single individual. \n \n The simple fact of the matter is, there WAS NO REALISTIC DEBATE ABOUT HER CONDITION. Her EEG was flat. End of story. \n \n The only reason this became an issue at all, was that for some god unknown reason, a percentage of our population felt that they knew better than the impartial court appointed neurologists who tested her. Somehow, a bunch of folks in this country felt that they were better informed about the case because of snippets they had picked up on the INTERNET or heard on the news, than the doctors, and hospice staff, and her husband, who have been living the whole ordeal for years. \n \n Just to highlight the idiocy of the whole thing.....Who made the decision to remove her feeding tube. I will give you a hint....it was NOT her husband. Even Delay, who is arguing like an idiot that the courts failed to uphold their responsibilities (what a joke) has said several times that her husband made the decision. He didn't.\n \n Rather than make the decision himself, Michael followed a procedure permitted by Florida courts by which a surrogate such as Michael can petition a court, asking the court to act as the ward's surrogate and determine what the ward would decide to do. Michael did this, and based on statements Terri made to him and others, he took the position that Terri would not wish to continue life-prolonging measures. The Schindlers took the position that Terri would continue life-prolonging measures. Under this procedure, the trial court becomes the surrogate decision-maker, and that is what happened in this case.\n \n The trial court in this case held a trial on the dispute. Both sides were given opportunities to present their views and the evidence supporting those views. Afterward, the trial court determined that, even applying the \"clear and convincing evidence\" standard, the highest burden of proof used in civil cases, the evidence showed that Terri would not wish to continue life-prolonging measures.\n \n The Republicans thought they could use this opportunity to pick up support from the fundies. Instead, they apparently have lost the libertarians and the true conservatives that are left. The presidents job approval rating sank lower than it has ever been durig that whole mess, and has not recovered to date. According to every poll I have seen, if we held congressional elections today, the democrats would take the house and the senate back by a landslide. And for what? Did the republicans really feel that the fundies were going to start voting democrat? \n \n What Delay is essentially doing here is trying to toss up activist courts in order to get the libertarians and true conservatives back, since that is a pretty serious political button for them. No right thinking person is really going to believe that 22 courts in florida, 3 federal courts, and the supreme court, which is certainly the republicans court right now, are all stacked with activist judges who disregarded their responsibilities and sided with the godless communists. \n \n Fundies are easy to lead around by their noses. They have never been particularly rational, and all any politician has ever had to do is get up there and mumble \"god\" and \"right to life\" and they fall right in line. Traditional conservatives and libertarians, who have always prided themselves as rational thinkers, are not quite so gullible. \n \n The democrats rediculous position on gun control cost them the presidency, and it cost them congress. I can't help but wonder if the republicans have leveled the playing field with their rediculous urge to cater to the religous right. I would not be at all surprised to see the republicans loose the house next time out due to this foolish stunt.",
