   "It's quite obvious that Yuschenko's election campaign is completely sponsored by interested parties in the West. And it's interesting to look at list of persons, wanted to elect Yuschenko Ukrainian President. And Mr. Soros gains the first place in this list. He has made $28 millions' contribution to Yuschenko's election fund. But it's necessary to stress that Yuschenko had never been able to receive timely support if he wouldn't have own international contacts. And here he should give thanks to his wife Catherine-Clare Chumachenko, as well as to the former president of closed joint-stock company \"Bringford\", David Zhvania, who is known as deputy bought his mandate in order to escape criminal prosecution. David Zhvania is kinsfolk of present Georgian premier Zurab Zhvania. And I think there is no need to explain that it also means the close links with Georgian President Michael Saakashvili. Thus, it becomes clear for everyone why \"revolution of roses\" has flown in Ukraine. But the question is in the following: Georgia is situated in the background of Europe, so its economic and social cataclysms (after coming to power American prot&#1081;g&#1081; Saakashvili) have no effect to Europe. But instability in Ukraine that in fact is a part of Europe will be reflected in European situation by all means. Some one says that it's US expectation. When America feigns the next \"velvet revolution\" near EU borders, it seeks ebbing of EU influence. It's quite clear. But why do Europeans pander to the USA in this case, sending its \"representatives\" and \"observers\" to Ukraine?",

Who sponsors his interests - the Russians (Putin) ?\n Best to lay your cards on the table before you get going on \"pandering to the USA\" etc.",
