   "I was under the impression it was L Ron Hubbard's great idea, basically he had an enormous ego and figured he'd create a religion (among other creations in different disciplines that he pursued) and make the bucks just like all the traditional religions. I suppose he succeeded. It's like a more \"modern\" religion.\n \n Of course, like most churches, it tries to convince you that you need it, and that you need to pay to support it. That's not a bad thing, most businesses and churches all do this same thing. \n \n Celebrities..man that's a ripe place for a church to mine. Many actors/acrtresses hit it big, but didn't need a lot of education nor good financial skills to get there (Nothing wrong with that!!). That makes them ripe for a sophisticated groups like scientology to step in and work their trade.\n \n If you like the idea of paying for support (like a church), I wouldn't say it's dangerous, it's probably fun if you have a strong mind and do it just to experience it. Otherwise, why bother. I just read some of those links...brainwashing? Scary...but who really knows.\n \n John Travolta, Tom Cruise...didn't seem to hurt them too much eh? ;) WIth big names like that, it makes me wonder if those big names are actually stakeholders in the income generated from Scientology...\n \n -Mach",
