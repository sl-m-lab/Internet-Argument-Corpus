'Military'-esque type of language like that is used all the time in churches to simply talk about evangelism or living the Christian life. The hymn \"Onward Christian Soldiers\" is a good example. It doesn't mean Christians should go out and join the military or do anything remotely like that. It's figurative. Paul even does this in the Bible with his \"armor of God\" passage in Ephesians.\n \n Now one could argue that maybe this camp ISN'T being figurative, but we just don't know because there's just not enough information here to go on.

   "No, it doesn't. No one said ANYTHING about 'extinguishing' anything. \n \n This thread is a great example of people's own prejudices about religion coming to light. The fact you'd go from one statement she made like that, and then jump to conclusions like thinking they would want other POVs \"extinguished\" is very telling, IMO. \n \n The world IS a dirty place, Matthew. It's dirty in a lot of ways, from crime, violence, people not caring about each other, etc. All you need ot do is watch the news. This ain't utopia.\n \n \n \n \"These type of Christians\", eh? What 'type' is that exactly, Matthew? Sort of like when people say \"these type of people\" when refering to gays? Or \"these type of blacks\"? Not that I expect you to actually step back and consider the sort of statements you're making.\n \n \n \n IOW, they should only be Christians if they never say a word and don't have the same right and opportunity everyone else has in this country to express their views. It seems you don't believe in freedom for religious people, Matthew. You have no idea if \"these type of Christians\" in this video are working to take your rights away at all.\n\n \n What part of they stepped over the line do you not understand. Of course they can speak out against things. It is when they try and make law based upon those beliefs that they cross the line.
