   "http://i38.photobucket.com/albums/e110/GodsCowboy/GODSMessages/BLOGPictures/AdamEveApple.jpg\n \n It happened in the GARDEN OF EDEN (read Genesis Chapter 3:8-11 below), after Adam and Eve ate the FORBIDDEN FRUIT. \n \n GOD came looking for Adam and Eve. That's was GOD'S FIRST CLUE that something was wrong. I bet HE NEVER had to look for them before. Then when HE called for them, they said they were afraid because they were naked. That was GOD'S SECOND CLUE that they had sinned. Not that GOD needs any clues. HE just wants us to know what our JUDGEMENT DAY will be like. Maybe this message from HIM MIGHT be enough to convince us to save our souls before it's too late.\n \n Anyway, the parable then says GOD asked them WHO TOLD YOU THAT YOU WERE NAKED? Their answers to GOD'S question proved they had broken HIS LAW. So it's our answers to the questions GOD will ask us that will EXPOSED (like we are NAKED) the truth about our lives. That's what our LAST JUDGEMENT DAY will be like. \n \n GOD will ask the questions that'll EXPOSE our sins. Our answers will bring EVERYTHING TO LIGHT. Our answers will justify GOD'S decision to call us one of HIS CHILDREN; punish us for our sins; or turn us over to the devil because our answers proved we chose to be one of the devil's children.\n \n Christ said it BEST, \"GO AND SIN NO MORE.\" (A word to the wise is sufficient.) \n \n This message is NOT my words but GOD'S WORDS. I am just HIS messenger. Doing MY BEST to UNDERSTAND the messages HE tries to teach me. Unfortunately, I'm a fool and DON'T understand EVERYTHING HE tries to teach me. I even assume I have the answers before HE finishes teaching. I find myself accepting 80% of the answer because it is so mach better than I could do on my own but GOD ISN'T happy with less than 110%. The extra effort that additional work requires is the problem that makes my presentation of HIS MESSAGES less than they could and should be.\n \n My prayer is that HE helps me find the people HE'S picked (like Christ's Apostles) that'll make me more productive. Or HE gives me the tools and BLESSING I need to do HIS job better, and faster. But I have a feeling HE has HIS reasons for the method HE'S chosen. Again, as Christ said, \"NOT MY WILL BUT THEY WILL BE DONE.\"  I am HIS SERVANT and a SERVANT does what the MASTER orders. Amen. \n \n Genesis Chapter 3:8-11\n \n 8 Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the Lord God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from the Lord God among the trees of the garden. 9 But the Lord God called to the man, \"Where are you?\" 10 He answered, \"I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid.\" 11 And he said, \"Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?\"",

   "Ummm...\n \n What makes you think this story is a parable???\n\n \n Adam and Eve represent a civilization. The FORBIDDEN FRUIT is the foods Moses told us NOT TO EAT. Eating those foods will cause sickness and death (maybe cancer, heart problems, birth defects...). I'm NOT an expert on the FORBIDDEN FOOD but the ones I know of are the animals and fish that clean up the environment. They eat wastes and junk the other animals WON'T eat. So by eating them we NOT ONLY eat the wastes they ate, you also stop them from cleaning the water we drink and the land we use to grown your food. So in time the water becomes less healthy and our land produces poorer crops. So we suffer because we ate the FOBIDDEN FOODS and because the water and land are NOT as healthy as they should be because the animals are not around to clean up the environment.\n \n Adam and Eve became aware of their NAKEDNESS (maybe they experienced a chill for the first time) and were told by GOD that because they eat the FORBIDDEN FRUIT they would have to SUFFER, be SICK and DIE. So be eating the FORBIDDEN FOODS that MOSES taught us about we experience a similar fate (cancer, heart problems, birth defects...).",

The Egyptians were one of the frist to attain that skill and Moses would have gotten some of the BEST schooling as a member of the royal family.\n\n \n Your biblical ignorance knows no bounds.\n Jesus broke the laws several times. Working on the Sabbath for example by eating and harvesting food to eat.\n \n He also said, it's not what you eat that causes you to sin. \n Establishing that eating foods isn't sinful.\n \n In a biblical context, at no point is the story of Genisis linked to the dietary prohibitions that Moses establised.\n A trees fruit has nothing to link it as a parable to eating certain types of foods.\n Those foods were called 'UNCLEAN' as they caused illness. Ilnness was traditionally seen as being related to a symptom of sin.\n The tree of the knowledge of right and wrong caused no illness but caused KNOWLEDGE. \n You linking these two is the most ludacris thing I've ever heard. And, you are the ONLY one to have ever uttered this in my experience. Your beliefs are not supported by the bible. Nor by the passage of Matthew you quote.\n \n As for what Adam ate in the Garden, it's clear that he ate what God told him he could. Fruits and vegetables. Death (even to animals) didn't occur until after the Fall. Read Gen 1:29-30 The ONLY thing God said not to eat was the fruit of the TREE. Eating flesh wasn't even a concept until after the Fall.\n So, I slam your ignorant answer out of the waters on the 4th qustion with a biblical passage.\n \n \n To continue this, Many practicing Jews have never eaten forbiden foods...yet, suffer of the flesh as those who do. Your logic fails. For it is your logic and not Gods word you spew here.\n \n And I really think you have no understanding of what 'the Law' means when it's refered to in the bible. \n \n Matthew 15:16-20.\n We know that eating with unclean hands now can cause you to become sick. But it is not sinful. What goes into the mouth does not make you 'unclean'. Pork is considered 'unclean' by Jews. But it's consumption does not make you unclean/sinful. Paul when converting Gentiles did not pass on the Jews laws but the laws of God. \n \n And furthermore, I didn't ask those questions you responded to.\n \n But, I do have a question.\n \n Have you stopped doing illegal psychotropic drugs?\n \n God didn't send you to be a messenger. You have no message. Only lies born of ignorance. And no one is that ignorant unless they have brain damage.\n \n \n As to your response to Abe...God didn't write the bible...a human did.\n God didn't write the Mosaic laws. A human did. Look to Matthew 19:7. A Mosaic law being replaced by the rules of God. The problem is the vast majority of people (including Christians) are simply biblically ignorant.\n You're the poster-boy for biblical ignorance.\n You make my jaw gape wide open in disbelief that someone could be as dense as you.\n \n Once again, I ask you \"What makes you think this story is a parable?\"\n Not 'How IS IT a parable. But, what gives you the impression that it is? See, Jesus spoke in parables because he admitted to doing so.\n \n And, like in evolution vs creationism, if Genesis is a parable, then so is the Fall...a MADE UP STORY. If the fall is a parable then there is no LITERAL need for a savior to come. If there is no NEED for a savior, then God wouldn't send one. Thus, Jesus was NOT the messiah as one would never be sent...except in PARABLE FORM.\n And, if it's all a book of parables to convey moral stories...great. But, so is Aesops fables...only Aesop was more entertaining, insightful and accurate.",

A spirit is not the same thing as a soul. \n But, due to your ignorance of the most basic of Christian theology, you probably won't get that and do what many do...deride something you don't understand.\n The Body was Chirst. The Holy Spirit (what you refer to) is everywhere. The God-head would be the soul as an analogy.\n \n In regards to Smiley's comment. \n You state God gave us the dietary laws.\n Jesus later stated that those rules were wrong.\n Thus it is 'God' vs 'Christ'.\n Leviticus rules (that you open the thread alluding to) vs Matthew and Mark on eating (that I and Smiley state). \n It's not what goes into you that that makes you sinful. Thus foods don't cause you to have sin if you eat them. And the list of prohibited foods in Lev. are not related to the tree of the knowledge of right and wrong. In historical context, they are foods that don't keep well in an arid environment (ya know, one without frigeration) and that cooking them improperly can result in health problems. It makes sense just to make them taboo rather than deal with the problems caused while eating pork. And thousands of years ago...it's doubtful that such 'bottom feeders' would acquire 'pollution' as you imply. \n \n In the OT bible and as an assumption by many in the NT (until Christ corrects them), it was believed that physical sickness WAS a symptom of spiritual sickness (sin). They are both the SAME. So, OT=eating contaminated foods made you sick. Being sick was a sign of spiritual sin. And NT=being physically sick is not a sign pf spiritual sin.\n This is also echoed when Jesus healed a man blind from birth. Others asked him what sin the man's parents did to result in a child born blind (as it was an OT belief that the sins of parents are passed onto their children and that a child's infirmities are the result of sin). Jesus corrected them saying there was no sin that caused the blindness and then healed the man of a physical (not spiritual) ailment.\n \n Your understanding of Matt 5 is flawed.\n As is your entire understanding of the bible.\n \n All this is easily seen with simple comprehension skills...which in this regard, you don't possess. You can't even understand nor respond to simpe requests not to bolden useless words in your passages.\n \n And when asked if you did drugs, it's an assumption that your silence on the issue means you did.\n If you didn't. You can chime up in your defense and correct that.",

Yet again you misunderstand a biblical text. My quote was to do with the foods the eating of which had been considered sinful, and how Jesus was saying that they are now not sinful. In fact, I believe that this is not the only thing that he is saying at this point, in much the same way as the story of the pridigal son is not just about a boy who moves away from home, spends all his money, and then comes home to a big party. What this passage is actually saying, is that all the laws about what you can and can't do (regarding food, clothing, sexual orientation), were just social rules set up at a time of crisis, so that a small tribe surrounded by heathens could expand and survive. What Jesus is actually saying is, it is what is in your heart that matters, whether you feel love for your fellow man or hatred.\n \n Your second paragraph actually states that Christ was wrong.\n \n \nSo your question should have been: Who is WRONG, Christ or Christ? \n\n \n I find this very strange. Was Jesus not the son of god (for the record I don't think he was, but then I don't think it is possible to be the son of a fictitious character unless you are also fictitious)? Was he just some religious upstart (as the authorities thought at the time) who was there to stir things up in the Jewish world? That is essentially what he was crucified for.\n \n I can tell you now that I have no misconception about god being physically like us. Unfortunately, you seem to have many misconceptions about what the bible is saying. Your idea that the tree of knowledge represents all the foods that were later ruled to be out of bounds is pure flight of fancy.

The Old Law was a covenant between God and man delivered to the people of the nation of Israel by the authority of the one and only true God. As such, it was considered a legal and binding contract. A contract cannot be done away with by breach, but it can be fulfilled if the requirements contained therein are meet by those under obligation, in this case those under contract were natural men, thus this is why God had to be flesh, the requirements had to be fulfilled by man. That requirement was to have a sinless existence to obtain salvation and have ONE PERFECT example as a sacrifice for all, this Jesus the Christ did, by walking this earth without sin. Next, for a New contract or covenant to come into existence it must be provided by He that holds the authority to do so. Again, Jesus the Christ, held this authority, \"And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, \"All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.\" (Matt.28:18). Thus, Christ very well indeed possessed the authority to create a New Covenant, and upon his death the Old was fulfilled and the New was presented as the \"PERFECT LAW OF LIBERTY\". If your logic holds true, that the \"end\" represents the end of time, why would God reveal through His profits the end of the Old Covenant Law of Moses? Consider,\"Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a NEW COVENANT with the house of ISRAEL, and with the house of Judah; NOT ACCORDING TO THE COVENANT THAT I MADE WITH THEIR FATHERS IN THE DAY THAT I TOOK THEM BY THE HAND TO BRING THEM OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT; which my covenant they brake, although I was a \"HUSBAND\" (considered only Israel, to the exclusion of all others to include the gentiles), saith the Lord........I WILL PUT MY LAW IN THEIR INWARD PARTS, AND WRITE IN IN THEIR HARTS; AND WILL BE THEIR GOD, AND THEY SHALL BE MY PEOPLE.\" (Jer. 31:31-33).\n \n Next consider the writings of Paul the apostle of the Christ, inspired by the \"SPIRIT OF TRUTH\", \"Having abolished in the flesh the enmity, EVEN THE LAW OF COMMANDMENTS CONTAINED IN ORDINANCES....(Eph.2:15). Also, \"But, if the ministration of death, WRITTEN AND ENGRAVEN ON STONES (ten commandments) \"was\" gloroius, so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory WAS TO BE DONE AWAY WITH.\" (2Cor.3:7). Just how is Jesus contradicting the word of God by fulfilling that which was made by prophecy? \n \n The dividing of the word that you speak about and obviously do not abide by, is a requirement of the \"perfect law of liberty\". As such, it does not matter how much \"you\" disagree, sense you do not make the laws, it must be considered when presenting the revealed word of God.

   "Well, actually in your quote Christ is talking about the health of the SOUL not physical health of our body. GOD is NEVER WRONG and when the SPIRIT speaks through man, GOD is still NEVER WRONG. However, there are times, when we, as undecuated (compared to GOD) beings, misunderstand what the SPIRIT is trying to say or teach us.\n \n For the record, my quote was from Christ (see below). So your question should have been: Who is WRONG, Christ or Christ? But as Christ told Peter it is NOT your words but the words of the SPIRIT. So I BELIEVE Christ's words in both cases came from the SPIRIT OF GOD not from a human called Christ.\n \n There is ONLY ONE GOD. UNFORTUNATELY, as FOOLISH HUMANS we assume HE is physically like us. HE is NOT like our physical body but our SOULS are like HIS SPIRIT (which is HIM). HIS SPIRIT (that's HIM) is EVERYWHERE. HE is (I AM) a SPIRIT. I DON'T BELIEVE there are THREE PERSONS in ONE GOD. There is ONLY ONE GOD who is EVERYWHERE. If GOD were THREE PERSONS that would indicate that all THREE of those persons can't be everywhere. Why would HE need to be THREE PERSONS if HE was EVERYWHERE already?\n \n We just haven't UNDERSTOOD HIM. But HE just might have wanted it that way or HE knew we weren't ready to understand the true concept yet. Only HE knows the reason(s), HE'S let us BELIEVE that misconseption. \n \n GOD is EVERYWHERE. HIS SPIRIT is in ALL of us because HE is EVERYWHERE. We just DON'T SEEK HIM OUT. \n MATTHEW 5:17-20\n \n 17 \"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. 18 I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished (END OF ALL THINGS). 19 Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. 20 For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.\n\n \n I've seen several posts trying to convience people that Christ's death on the cross ENDED GOD'S contracts with man that were made via Moses and the prophets.\n \n The passage I quoted above says those LAWS wil last till the END OF TIME (Christ's words NOT MINE).\n \n You people argue with GOD like little children argue with their parents. \n \n PARABLE OF THE CRY BABY KIDS\n \n Young kids think they can CONVIENCE their parents to see things their way. However, their PARENTS (LIKE GOD) know more about the world, bad people and things that their children haven't learned yet. Still the Children BELIEVE their parents will give in and allow them to break their laws. They BELIEVE their parent will do away with the laws because no one else has to follow those laws. They think those laws are STUPID. But the OLDER and WISER parents continue to ENFORCE the LAWS.\n \n Well, GUESS WHAT. GOD knows more than you or I. If HE gives us a LAW there's a GOOD REASON for it. HE ISN'T going to change the LAW just because some cry babies DON'T like it. HE wants to PROTECT HIS CHILDREN. So HE gives us LAWS to help us stay safe and happy just like parents give their children laws. But just like little kids we AREN'T smart enough to UNDERSTAND GOD and we DON'T have HIS WISDOM so we ASSUME HIS LAWS AREN'T IMPORTANT. \n \n GOD wants to know WHEN are we going to GROW UP (in faith in HIM)? We have to TRUST GOD like a LITTLE CHILD or YOUNG ADULT should TRUST his or her parents. GOD DOESN'T give us LAWS for the FUN of it. They WON'T CHANGE and HE ISN'T going to let you break it just because you DON'T think it's that big a deal. \n \n Some day just like those little kids, you're going to know why GOD gave you those laws. The question is: Will it be when you get PUNISHED by HIS COURT and HIS LAW ENFORCEMENT DEPARTMENT like a young adult that gets punished for DUI. Or will it be when get rewarded because you followed HIS LAWS. \n \n The person that follows GOD'S LAWS gets to see what happens to others that DON'T obey HIS LAWS. Like a young adult that obeyd his or her parents and DIDN'T drink and drive but heard and seen about what happened to his or her friends that did. Now he or she knows why his or her parents wouldn't let him or her go to the bar with their friends last night. He or she is glad they OBEYED their parents' STUPID LAWS.\n \n The question is: Will you be smart enough to OBEY GOD'S LAWS or Will you be one of the ones that HAS to learn the HARD WAY?",

   "Let's simplify this for you.\n \n I shall ask again (as you have not yet answered this question).\n \n Did Jesus change part of the old law by stating that all previously prohibited foods were now okay?\n \n Do you think you can answer that some time before the heaven and earth do pass away?\n \n Why you are avoiding it is beyond me.\n \n Smiley\n\n \n None of the promises from the Old Testaments were done away with, just the writings that were written on stone which were contrary to any gentile having the ability to be offered salvation....and yes the notion that any food product is considered unsafe was in fact nailed to the cross of Christ as well, as witnessed by the vision of Peter in the Book of Acts, as some of the peoples were still trying to hold onto the Old Law and its bondage, and even prohibit Gentiles from gaining salvation (Acts 10).\n \n What is so hard to comprehend? Our Bibles are composed of two parts, an Old Testament and a New Testament. Why were these names even selected? A testament is a will or a covenant. We still use the word today when anyone speaks of a person's \"last will and testament\". These names indicate that the Bible is composed of two wills of God--an old and a new. The will was changed, not because of the imperfection of its requirements but because man did not possess the ability to abide by its declarations. The Law defined what sin was, but it brought no relief from sin, and everyone sins. It could only offer a future hope of salvation (Rom.7:7-13). The Law bound sin to men, but Christ freed us from sin (Galatians 4:21-31).\n \n As I said earlier, the change in will/Laws is discussed at great length in the letter to the Hebrews. In this book 1:1-2, the author says, \"God, after He spoke long ago to the fathers in the prophets in many portions and in many ways, in these last days had spoken to us in His Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the world.\" God has changed the manner in which he directs his people. This change was foretold in the Book of Jeremiah 31:31-34 (The scripts have already been presented on previous post). Notice that God said the covenant (or testament/will) would be DIFFERENT from the law given at Mt. Sinai. Why would God change his law? Did he change his mind? No, rather, the change in the law was planned from the very beginning. Before the world was created, God planned to send his Son and that through Jesus we would obtain salvation (1Peter 1:19-20, 2Tim. 1:9, 2 Thessalionians 2:13-14). Such a salvation through Jesus Christ could not take place under the law given by Moses. \n \n The Hebrew writer list several proofs that the covenant between man and God had changed. 1.) There was a change in the priesthood. The author of Heb. proves that Jesus is now our High Priest (Heb.5:1-10). However, Jesus was not a descendant of Aaron--he was not even of the tribe of Levi. Rather, we find that the order of Aaron was not meant to be permanent (Heb.7:11). Thus, a change in the order implies there was a change in the Law (Heb. 7:12-17). Suppose for a moment that the Law of Moses was still in effect. We would be forced to say that Jesus violated the law when he became our High Priest. However, no violation of the law has occurred because there is a NEW LAW in effect.\n \n 2.) There was a change in sacrifices (Heb.9:16-28, 19:1-8). The Old Law had yearly sacrifices which could not free us from sin. The New Law had a single sacrifice that did free us from the bondage of sin...Christ Jesus. Jesus fulfilled the Law (Matt. 5:17-18). In other words he brought it to completion (Rom.10:4). Before Christ, no one could perfectly keep the law, but Jesus proved that it was possible to keep the law. Jesus showed that God's Law was good, it was man who was the sinner.\n \n When did this change take place? Paul said the Old Law was nailed to the cross (Col.2:14). In Ephesians 2:15, we are told that it was put to death on the cross of Calvary. The author of Heb. put it this way, \"For where a covenant is, there must of necessity be the death of the one who made it. For a covenant is valid only when men are dead, for it is never in force while the one who made it lives.\" (Heb.9:16-17). At the acceptance of the Old Law, Moses sprinkled the people with blood (Exodus 24:8). The new covenant also began with the shedding of blood--Christs' death on the cross. Christ testament could not come into effect until he, as its author, died.\n \n Though the Laws are different, can't we follow both of them? Does it make any difference which Law we turn to, since both Laws came from God? God said that he took away the first to establish the second (Heb.10:9). We became dead to the Old Law, so that we might be joined to a New Law (Rom.7:4-6). It is the same situation as a husband whose wife had died. While his wife is alive, he cannot be joined to a second woman (Rom. 7:1-4), but after his first wife dies he is free to a second woman. In the same manner, we can't join ourselves to the new Law until the first Law was taken away. If we didn't wait until that point in time, we would have committed spiritual adultery.\n \n We cannot even keep a select portion of the Old Law. The first problem is; How do we determine which portion to keep and which to discard? We know that we are inadequate to make such a decision (Jer.10:23). Besides, it wouldn't work. If we justify ourselves by one part of the Law, we obligate ourselves to uphold the whole thing (Gal.5:3). It is this very point that caused Paul to argue so strongly against the false teachers of his day. Some Christians, who came from the Jewish faith, were teaching that those who were once Gentiles, must become Jews. However, notice Paul strong words, \"You have been severed from Christ, you who are seeking to be justified by the law; you have fallen from grace (Gal.5:4)\n \n Why do we still need the Old Testament in our Bibles? Romans 15:4 tells us that it was written for our learning---to bring us patience, comfort, and hope. It contains examples for us, so that we will not be caught unaware and make the same mistakes that the Israelites made (1Cor. 10:1-2). In Galatians 3:24-25, we find that the Old Law is our schoolmaster, to bring us to Christ. Now that Christ has come we are no longer under its dominion. If we are to determine what God would have us do today, we must turn to his current WILL--THE NEW TESTAMENT OF GRACE, Authored by Christ Jesus. (BLU)",

If we are to determine what God would have us do today, we must turn to his current WILL--THE NEW TESTAMENT OF GRACE, Authored by Christ Jesus. (BLU)\n\n Thank you for answering my question this time. I didn't ask for all the rest, but it does bring up further questions.\n \n So, we have established that Jesus fulfilled the old law when he died on the cross. This was when the old law was given up and the new became 'the law'. We have also established that Jesus broke the old law (or committed 'spiritual adultery', as you put it) when he decided that the prohibited foods were no longer 'unclean' (note that the old law was still in force then). You stated that there was no violation of the law because the new law was in effect, yet this did not happen until his death, so either I must be misunderstanding something or you have a problem with chronology.\n \n You also say that the law was changed (from old to new) because man was not capable of abiding by the old law. God knew this would be the case from the beginning of time and even planned it that way. It begs the question . . . \n \n Why would god . . .\n \n a) declare laws that were impossible to abide by?\n b) change the laws simply because his people couldn't handle them?\n \n Indeed, you seem to suggest that god deliberately created a set of rules that were impossible to follow in order to bind sin to men. So it was god's will that all men would become sinful. Then along comes Jesus who has to die in order to save everyone from sin. But then the new law would appear to be impossible to uphold too, as no-one has managed to do it (everyone sins). Though, I realise that just because something has not yet happened, it does not follow that it is impossible.\n \n This suggests, to me anyway, that the old law was not perfect (as you seem to think). What is the point in creating laws that are impossible to uphold? It also suggests that the new law is not significantly better.\n \n You also state that we should not try to abide by any part of the old law anymore, but rather just adhere to the new law, as 'If we justify ourselves by one part of the Law, we obligate ourselves to uphold the whole thing (Gal.5:3)'.\n \n This begs the question, why do people still try to cherrypick parts of the old law that they say are still obligatory? Disregarding those parts that are inconvenient to them, of course.\n \n Smiley",

Isn't that blasphemous?\n \n And another piece of advice. Don't believe everthing you read (or 'is written', as you put it).\n\n \n No, you really must try reading, the scripts. Especially this one, \"The words, of the Lord are pure words; as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. Thou shalt keep them, O Lord, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever. (Ps. 12:6-7) Now you are suggesting that God does not have the power to keep his promise, that His words be not corrupted? And yes you are misunderstanding the scriptures, as concerning the scripts, which \"you\" conclude to teach that Christ sinned.\n \n Just what would preclude Jesus from teaching the things that were to come under the New Covenant of Grace? By teaching of the things to come before it actually was in force does not constitute a breach of the commandments. Did not Moses also teach of things which would be of a transistional nature? \n \n Everything that Jesus taught and said was not under the authority of the Old Law. Jesus was indeed born under the old law and lived perfectly without sin (2Cor.5:21, 1Peter 2:21, 1John 3:5), if not then we must conclude that God is a liar, as all scripture is given by inspiration of God (11Tim.3:16-17).\n \n While Jesus was born under the law and lived perfectly under the law, the focus of his teaching and the goal and purpose of His life was the establishment of HIS KINGDOM to come, after His death. Thus everything Jesus said about the kingdom is of application to the kingdom to come not to that which was in force The Old Law. \n \n Jesus talked about principles of the kingdom that were righteous principals. Those principles could also be found in the Law of Moses. Christ as having \"all\" authority and considered the great \"I AM\" held the authority to speak of things to come in a righteous context. For instance the sermon on the mount (Matt. 5-7) is about the righteousness of the kingdom to come, Christ's kingdom. These points of righteousness could in fact be found in principal in the old law, but the teachers of old law had not taught these points before. As I pointed out previous, anyone wishing to enter into the new kingdom that was to come must exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees (Matt. 5:19). The Christ is teaching of a coming change, and as such is not breaching the Old Law, just explaining the New Law to come, shortly. As I said, we are given a biblical example of such in the Old Testament.\n \n Moses was born under the patriarchal law, but that did not keep him from commanding the passover command before he got to Sinai. See Exodus 12, which was eight chapters before he ever gave the Sinai Law.\n \n Moses commanded the passover which carried over into the Sinai testament, and Israel would always look back to what Moses had taught them in Egypt concerning the passover and would continue to base their actions on that teaching Moses gave WHILE HE WAS UNDER THE PATRIARCHAL LAW.\n \n Being born under patriarchal law did not prevent Moses from working toward the establishment of a national Israel. Neither did the fact that Jesus was born under the law of Moses prevent Him from working toward the establishment of spiritual Israel.\n \n Being born under the patriarchal law did NOT mean that \"everything\" Moses said and taught was under the authority of the patriarchal law. Moses was given divine right to speak things that pertained to the coming of national Israel. Likewise by \"biblical example\" being born under the Law of Moses did NOT mean that \"everything\" Jesus said and taught was under the authority of the OT Law. Jesus, as being given all authority under heaven and in earth (Matt. 28:18) was given divine right to speak things that pertained to \"SPIRITUAL ISRAEL\" of the things to come and what would be expected.\n \n The major focus of Jesus' preaching was indeed concerning the kingdom to follow( The New Law of Spiritual Israel). Consider, (Matt. 4:23, 5:3, 10,19,6:10, 10:7, 11:12, 13:11, 19..etc.) Being born under the Old Law, did not mean the focus of His preaching was on the tutoring of the Law-Gal.3:24-25. But being the Christ(Messiah), his focus was on preparing those that were taught under the old law, the things that were to shortly come. (Matthew 6:10). Simple, right? You know, it is much easier to comprehend and be \"edified\" if one lets the scriptures interpret themselves, instead of injecting personal opinion into the mix. (BLU)",

But it was a \"lying spirit\" that was dispatched and allowed to tempt Ahab, not God. God did not lie. God cannot lie. \n \n Paul told us, \"And for this reason God will send them strong delusion, that they should believe the lie, that they all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness\" 11Thessaionians 2:11-12. It is NOT that God, Himself, lies or approves of lying. However, God will make use of liars to deceive people who already demonstrate a disregard for the truth. Such was the nature of Ahab.\n \n The same principal applies to those that profess to be psychic, have you not ever seen a horoscope or heard a prediction by a supposed psychic? The answers they give are generally worded in such a vague way that just about anything could happen and one would say, \"That is just what the person said would happen\". When King Jehospaphat asked for God's advise, the false prophets that came gave a vague answer; \"Go up, for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king\" (1Kings 22:6). Once the false prophets found a great but vague statement, they kept repeating it over and over again (1Kings 22:12). King Jehoshaphat didn't like the answer, most likely because he knew that it was to vague. He wanted to hear a response from a real prophet. King Ahab reluctantly sent for a prophet named Micaiah. Now as Micaiah is fetched he is instructed, \"Now listen, the words of the prophets with one accord encourage the king. Please, let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak encouragement' (1 Kings 22:13). So when Micaiah answered the king, he said,\"Go and prosper, for the LORD will deliver it into the hand of the king!\" (1Kings22:15). He was told to answer just like the false prophets, and this is \"exactly\" what Micaiah did. In other words, Micaiah did not lie (the vague statement did cover the truth), but he did mock the king by giving him exactly what he commanded Micaiah to say. \n \n Interestingly, even though Ahab accepted the vague answer from his lying prophets, Ahab rejected the same answer from Micaiah. Obviously, somewhere deep inside Ahab knew that God wasn't supporting him. Even more amazing is that when Micaiah told Ahab clearly that he would die and that vague answer form the false prophets were a part of a heavenly plot to get Ahab to go into battle, Ahab went anyway. Ahab was so far gone into sin that he would rather follow what he knew to be a lie than to follow God. Isn't that just what Paul said in 11Thessaloinas 2:11-12? \n \n God doesn't tempt people with evil (James 1:13). He cannot lie. He commands His followers not to lie. However, it doesn't mean that God will not take advantage of the fact that there are people willing to lie to accomplish His will. It doesn't excuse the liar nor make the consequence of lying any less severe. \n \n Got any more battle of wits to present against the scriptures? (BLU)",

   "I've seen several posts trying to convience people that Christ's death on the cross ENDED GOD'S contracts with man that were made via Moses and the prophets.\n \n The passage I quoted above says those LAWS wil last till the END OF TIME (Christ's words NOT MINE).\n \n You people argue with GOD like little children argue with their parents. \n \n PARABLE OF THE CRY BABY KIDS\n \n Young kids think they can CONVIENCE their parents to see things their way. However, their PARENTS (LIKE GOD) know more about the world, bad people and things that their children haven't learned yet. Still the Children BELIEVE their parents will give in and allow them to break their laws. They BELIEVE their parent will do away with the laws because no one else has to follow those laws. They think those laws are STUPID. But the OLDER and WISER parents continue to ENFORCE the LAWS.\n \n Well, GUESS WHAT. GOD knows more than you or I. If HE gives us a LAW there's a GOOD REASON for it. HE ISN'T going to change the LAW just because some cry babies DON'T like it. HE wants to PROTECT HIS CHILDREN. So HE gives us LAWS to help us stay safe and happy just like parents give their children laws. But just like little kids we AREN'T smart enough to UNDERSTAND GOD and we DON'T have HIS WISDOM so we ASSUME HIS LAWS AREN'T IMPORTANT. \n \n GOD wants to know WHEN are we going to GROW UP (in faith in HIM)?

They WON'T CHANGE and HE ISN'T going to let you break it just because you DON'T think it's that big a deal. \n \n Some day just like those little kids, you're going to know why GOD gave you those laws.

   "The ramblings of people that do not know which polar extreme to draw upon to present their logic, is at least an interesting take on materialism to say the least. With all the retorts presented there has not been one point proven of the accusations thrown at the scriptures. Its clear that the secular web sites have been ablaze in an attempt to \"parrot\" the next so called \"contradiction\". \n \n Better men than can be found on this site have over the past two thousand years attempted such as to find a presentation of error, none have meet with success. I especially like the part about those of unbelief trying to teach what truths can be found in scripture. First they conclude that they can take the physical laws that God created and gestated from outside of this physical realm and prove by such laws that He that gestated their being, can not possibly have the ability to breach such. That would be like saying that even though I constructed a house, and own such and have the key to enter and exit, that I do not possibly have the ability to do such. By just what knowledge does \"any\" draw upon to conclude that He that exists outside time and space does not have any certain ability? All we may draw upon are physical laws that we must answer to in this plane of existence that we are bound...NO? \n \n Consider the facts of logic, for any that claim to have such. As a Christian, even if the all the doubts presented were proven, ABSOLUTELY in empirical evidence that no intelligent man could ignore, just what have I missed through believing in God? Even if there is no God, no true Word, and no heaven, what does a Christian miss by living a righteous, faithful life?\n \n A true Christian is far better off physically than an unbeliever. We are taught that our Bodies, are the temple of the Holy Spirit (Rom. 12:1). A temple must be treated with respect and care. Proper diet, exercise, and preventive medicine should be a part of a true Christian's life. He will not abuse his body with drugs and other harmful substances. He will avoid putting himself in situations that are evil and hurtful. Drunken driving, fights, and other law-braking activities can not threaten him physically. Because they are not part of his life.\n \n A true Christian should be better off materially because of ethical values. Basic honesty affects one's business. He does not seek illegal or unethical advantage. He is careful to do what is right in the eyes of everybody that he engages in the practice of business with (Rom.12:17). A true person of God is doubly blessed. He has enough for himself and enough to share with those who are in need (Eph. 4:28). He enjoys the pleasure of having all he requires and the greater blessing of giving to help others.\n \n A true Christian's personal relationships are not corrupted by many practices of the world. Because he will be true to his marriage vows, the Christian will not know the sorrow of adultery or sexual perversions and a broken home. (Eph. 5:25, 28). A stable marriage adds to life's pleasures and meaning. A Christian is also a good neighbor since he loves his neighbor as himself (Matt. 22:37-38).\n \n A true Christian is a good citizen, as he is instructed to Obey all rules of government.\n \n Just what does one lose by being a Christian? Nothing but the negatives and problems of life. Even if there is no God, no Heaven or hell, no biblical authority for moral values to draw upon, the Christians quality of life is still far better than that of the unbeliever. THE REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION is not what does a Christian lose if the unbeliever is proven right, BUT, WHAT DOES THE UNBELIEVER LOSE IF THE CHRISTIAN IS RIGHT? Just his ETERNAL SOUL being separated from all that he ever loved, and condemned to eternal suffering. If this were to be placed on a gaming table, Who is taking the greater risk? \n \n As a Christian I have no biblical right nor justification to judge anyone. My soul duty is to present the truth and let the hearer thereof determine his own fate. My personal opinion carries no weight of condemnation, nor should it. But once presented with the truth, those very words that some chose to ignore will one day Judge them, Not I, \"And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not, for I come not to judge the world, but to save the world. He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him; the WORD that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day. (John 12:47-48). \n \n God Bless, and may the peace of the Son be upon you always, (RW BLU)",

   "Do you attend church services on the SABBATH? Does your PREACHER give a sermon during that service on the SABBATH?\n\n Good point. According to the Bible, preachers should be stoned too. What hypocrites.\n \n \nIf so, I'd say you approve of HIS WORK on the SABBATH. How can you tell me that MY PREACHING (DOING GOD'S WORK) is ILLEGAL but your preacher is allowed to do it?\n\n I never said it was illegal. The Bible, on the other hand, says don't do it. I don't approve of any of \"His work,\" really, regardless of the day. \n \n \nAs for my PREACHING STYLE, it may or may not be GOD'S PREFERRED style but my point is HE ISN'T complaining.\n\n He isn't complaining about my method, either. My method involves making your method look like it involves an uncontrollable urge to spew random words.",

   "The ramblings of people that do not know which polar extreme to draw upon to present their logic, is at least an interesting take on materialism to say the least. With all the retorts presented there has not been one point proven of the accusations thrown at the scriptures. Its clear that the secular web sites have been ablaze in an attempt to \"parrot\" the next so called \"contradiction\". \n\n Want to be specific or are you just saying things that sound good to you but have no real meaning (aka pseudo intelligence).\n \n \nBetter men than can be found on this site have over the past two thousand years attempted such as to find a presentation of error, none have meet with success.\n\n No one is better than me. And all those who have gone before me have presented errors that were not dealt with in an honest manner other than by waving a magic wand and explaining you needed 'magic understanding to know what's being said.' Such dismissive behavior is the sign of a cult.\n \n \nI especially like the part about those of unbelief trying to teach what truths can be found in scripture. First they conclude that they can take the physical laws that God created and gestated from outside of this physical realm and prove by such laws that He that gestated their being, can not possibly have the ability to breach such.\n\n And there you do it. Making assumptions that the natural abilities are unfit for supernatural (a made up concept) issues.\n Tell me, if your God is a LIVING GOD, can you present Him to me?\n \n \nThat would be like saying that even though I constructed a house, and own such and have the key to enter and exit, that I do not possibly have the ability to do such. By just what knowledge does \"any\" draw upon to conclude that He that exists outside time and space does not have any certain ability? All we may draw upon are physical laws that we must answer to in this plane of existence that we are bound...NO? \n\n What you miss is an understanding of the universe.\n Material and time are qualities of this. Before these qualities came into existance with the creation of this usiverse, we have NO way of understanding what may have been.\n See, you say it's God, yet have no proof.\n We say 'We DON'T KNOW'...\n A huge difference there.\n \n \nConsider the facts of logic, for any that claim to have such. As a Christian, even if the all the doubts presented were proven, ABSOLUTELY in empirical evidence that no intelligent man could ignore, just what have I missed through believing in God? Even if there is no God, no true Word, and no heaven, what does a Christian miss by living a righteous, faithful life?\n\n More freedom for starters. Freedom to adapt and to grow without having to resort to an ancient text writen by ignorant people who didn't even know how a child was formed in the womb, who didn't even know the causes of weather nor of proper food preparation and the ability to preserve it. \n How about not having to pay a perverted tithe?\n Many churches don't even use these funds for what they were historically for and now have pastors pimping their sheep for personal profit.\n How about not having to be told to waste your time praying to a non-existant entity and instead devoting that time to more productive purposes. \n \n \nA true Christian is far better off physically than an unbeliever. We are taught that our Bodies, are the temple of the Holy Spirit (Rom. 12:1). A temple must be treated with respect and care. Proper diet, exercise, and preventive medicine should be a part of a true Christian's life. He will not abuse his body with drugs and other harmful substances. He will avoid putting himself in situations that are evil and hurtful. Drunken driving, fights, and other law-braking activities can not threaten him physically. Because they are not part of his life.\n\n This is an incorrect assumption. A 'Christian' is not better off physically. You are not all taught equally for starters thus, we see a disproportion of gluttonous believers riddled with disease and fat. The bible mentions NOTHING of dieting or exercise nor of preventative medicine and historically, many practioners of medicine were treated as witches. Even now, Christian Scientists and the the largest growing sect, Word of Faith, believes that faith is ALL you need and to rely upon medicine shows a lack of faith in the promises of healing they say god promises in the bible. \n Also, some Christians take the few comments in the bible and expand them to be absolutes. From 'don't be a drunkard' to 'don't drink alcohol at ALL...and we'll ignore that bit where Jesus did.'\n Nope, Christians have been regressive and unhealthy for much of their history relying on simple ideas that hard work = fitness.\n And furthermore, your life is at risk from those othes who do those horrible things. Good Christians are slaughterd every day by drunken drivers. \n \n \nA true Christian should be better off materially because of ethical values. Basic honesty affects one's business. He does not seek illegal or unethical advantage. He is careful to do what is right in the eyes of everybody that he engages in the practice of business with (Rom.12:17). A true person of God is doubly blessed. He has enough for himself and enough to share with those who are in need (Eph. 4:28). He enjoys the pleasure of having all he requires and the greater blessing of giving to help others.\n\n Not unless you're one of the 'true Christians' who's coerced into giving 10 percent of your income away. Nor one of those who have flexible morals where it's fine to use the wealth of the 'evil' ones for your own godly purposes. Biblical passages support this and I've seen Christians quite often bend morality and shoe-horn it to fit their concept of what the bible teaches.\n But, I guess you'd not call them 'true' Christians. \n And, what ever happened to prohibitions against usery and charging high interest?\n \n \nA true Christian's personal relationships are not corrupted by many practices of the world. Because he will be true to his marriage vows, the Christian will not know the sorrow of adultery or sexual perversions and a broken home. (Eph. 5:25, 28). A stable marriage adds to life's pleasures and meaning. A Christian is also a good neighbor since he loves his neighbor as himself (Matt. 22:37-38).\n\n Non-believers engage in the same. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \nA true Christian is a good citizen, as he is instructed to Obey all rules of government.\n\n For the Jews begged God so much for a king of their own...that they were given ones...who were tyrants. \n A good citizen doesn't blindly follow the guv'ment. emoticon_rolleyes \n \n \nJust what does one lose by being a Christian? Nothing but the negatives and problems of life. Even if there is no God, no Heaven or hell, no biblical authority for moral values to draw upon, the Christians quality of life is still far better than that of the unbeliever. THE REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION is not what does a Christian lose if the unbeliever is proven right, BUT, WHAT DOES THE UNBELIEVER LOSE IF THE CHRISTIAN IS RIGHT? Just his ETERNAL SOUL being separated from all that he ever loved, and condemned to eternal suffering. If this were to be placed on a gaming table, Who is taking the greater risk? \n\n You lose the salvation offered by other gods. Yes, you'll sit under the table and starve for all eternity and not eat of the plate of Fluffnacker that's always full. \n But, what you lose if we're right has already been out lined and more could be added. \n All you're doing is presenting Pascals Sucker Bet. \n If this is a gaming table, you lost before the pieces were even set out.\n \n \nAs a Christian I have no biblical right nor justification to judge anyone.\n\n Ummm, yes you do. The bible calls you to police your own fellow followers and you can only do that by 1st judging them. \n \n \nMy soul duty is to present the truth and let the hearer thereof determine his own fate.\n\n You mean regurgitate your limited understanding of your bible and call it truth.\n \n \nMy personal opinion carries no weight of condemnation, nor should it. But once presented with the truth, those very words that some chose to ignore will one day Judge them, Not I, \"And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not, for I come not to judge the world, but to save the world. He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him; the WORD that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day. (John 12:47-48).\n\n So, logic would dictate that the unbeliever should exterminate the believer least they inform the unbeliever of this message. For if we never had heard the message, how can we be condemned by it?\n See, logic says you seek not to bring salvation (for such would be given to those who haven't heard the message naturally) but to bring damnation to those who, having heard it, deny it. \n Sounds reasonable to me.\n Cull 1/3 of the human race now and all others born later will automatically go to 'heaven'.\n And, if we're wrong, all we lose is the Christains.\n I can live with that...heck, I could participate in it.\n Not out of any real hate to you but out of love for the generations to come. Shouldn't they get to automatically go to heaven for all eternity rather than hear your twisted message and risk damnation?\n Opps, look at that, another detriment of being a Christian...\n \n \nGod Bless, and may the peace of the Son be upon you always, (RW BLU)\n\n \n Vishnu bless you too.",
