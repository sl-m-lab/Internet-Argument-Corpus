   "Gun control legislation | arrest drug crime | prohibit ownership | The Daily Caller - Breaking News, Opinion, Research, and Entertainment\n \n \nGet collared years ago on a bogus drug charge because the oregano in your back pocket looked like was a bag of weed? Or maybe a judge back in 2006 dropped those charges because you were able to provide proof for that Adderall prescription? Under proposed legislation, it will not matter if you were innocent all along or even proven innocent by a court of law.\n \n Either way, you can forget about buying a gun.\n \n The Fix Gun Checks Act of 2011 would greatly expand the definition of those legally prohibited from owning firearms to include anyone who's ever been arrested - even if never convicted or found guilty - for drug possession within a five-year period. The legislation is certainly troubling for those who want a \"common sense\" debate about drug decriminalization. And it would seem fears that any new national gun-control legislation would be used to limit the gun-rights of law-abiding citizens is at least partially justified.\n \n Sponsored by New York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer and introduced earlier this month, the expanded background checks bill includes a \"clarification of the definition of drug abusers and drug addicts who are prohibited from possessing firearms.\" Under Schumer's bill, the definition of a \"drug abuser\" would include anyone with \"an arrest for the use or possession of a controlled substance within the past 5 years.\"\n \n Current federal law already specifies that two kinds of drug users can be barred from owning a gun: (1) Those who have been convicted of possessing or using a controlled substance in the past year and (2) Anyone who has had multiple drug arrests in the past five years, including one within a year of applying for a firearm, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.\n \n The rules surrounding what \"inference\" the federal government can make about a current \"drug user\" are complicated. Add to that regulations stating who is prohibited from owning a firearm; a cumbersome background check system; and inter-departmental communication and, suddenly, the combination of firearms and drugs becomes a confusing bureaucratic mess of regulations and codes.\n \n But the \"arrest\" language of Schumer's bill and a clarification from the ATF indicate that a greater number of innocent Americans would be barred from owning a gun if the Senate bill becomes law.\n \n \"Under the definition of 'unlawful user' ... an inference of current use could be drawn if the one arrest resulted in a conviction for use or possession of a controlled substance within the past year,\" the ATF told the The Daily Caller.\n \n To clear up any confusion, Schumer's bill would expand that \"inference\" to say: if you've ever been arrested for any kind of drug use or possession in the past five year, you can be denied the lawful possession of a firearm.\n \n The bill's definition of an \"unlawful user\" also includes anyone arrested for drug paraphernalia within the past five years if the paraphernalia is found have traces of a drug, and those who make an \"admission\" to using or possessing a controlled substance in the past five years. The meaning of \"admission,\" however, is not defined.\n \n Schumer's office was unavailable for comment. One thing is clear, though: the senator's legislation would prohibit a lot more innocent-until-proven-guilty people from possessing firearms.\n \n A little more than 1,600,000 people were arrested in 2009 on drug violations, according to statistic from the Federal Bureau of Investigations. About half of those people were arrested on marijuana charges, with simple drug possession - rather than sale or manufacturing - accounting for nine-tenths of those collars, according to Reason magazine. It's those last set of figures that could very well rally two groups most people might consider odd bed-fellows: pot-smokers and firearms enthusiasts.\n \n Aaron Houston, director of government relations for Students for Sensible Drug Policy, said adding even more penalties to those thousands of people arrested for marijuana \"doesn't do anything to solve the problem.\"\n \n \"It makes criminals out of law-abiding Americans. Clearly, [similar drug policies] have not worked up until now,\" said Houston. \"Heaping criminal penalties onto otherwise law-abiding Americans just because they possess a little bit of marijuana is a failed policy.\"\n \n The SSDP doesn't have an official position on the Fix Gun Checks Act of 2011, but Houston said that if the \"arrest\" language was removed, the group \"certainly wouldn't find it as problematic as we do now.\"\n \n The current National Instant Background Check System (NICS) only requires a check on those purchasing a firearm from a licensed dealer. Gun-control advocates have pushed for those checks to include guns exchanged between individuals, which is often referred to as the \"gun show loophole.\" The addition of Schumer's drug legislation plays directly off public fears that accused Tucson shooter Jared Loughner - apart from allegedly being determined to kill no matter wat - also admitted to using marijuana. No research, however, has proven a causal link between marijuana use and violent acts.\n \n New York Democratic Rep. Carolyn McCarthy is expected to introduce a companion background check bill - modeled after Schumer's - in the House very soon. Houston called Schumer \"terrible on this stuff,\" and expressed dismay that McCarthy would include similar language in her bill. McCarthy's office said it was moving forward carefully but wants to ensure that \"the most dangerous people who shouldn't be allowed to buy guns are in the NICS database.\"\n \n \"Everyone agrees on the goals of the bills to require a background check for every sale and to make sure more names of people who should be in the database are actually put into the database,\" said a spokesman for McCarthy. \"As for any more specifics, that's being discussed.\"\n \n Even the nation's largest gun-control advocacy group, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, has problems with Schumer's drug language.\n \n \"It's a concern we've raised about this proposal, too. I've got the same concerns,\" said Paul Helmke, president of the Brady Campaign. \"[There is] the whole innocent-until-proven-guilty concept coming into play here. So that alone is a legitimate concern.\"\n \n Helmke said the Brady Campaign was working closely with McCarthy's office, noting that the representative's legislation hasn't even been introduced yet.\n \n \"It's not going to be introduced after this recess week, and they're going to be making some changes,\" said Helmke.\n\n \n Anybody else think this is a bad idea? Or are the people like Brady going to holler from the rooftops that this is the greatest idea of the 21st century and suggest taking it even further than what's been proposed currently?",

   "Gun Group Against Bill to \"Improve\" Background Checks \n In fact, the bill would not only qualify an untold number of individuals as being newly prohibited, but would actually establish a system whereby institutions and individuals could effectively and authoritatively strip law-abiding citizens of there constitutional rights - all without due process.\n \n Here is what Sen. Schumer's bill calls for:\n Section 103(a) - Lowers the standard of individuals who are \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" and thereby increases the number of citizens who are prohibited from possessing firearms. By adding 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(36), the bill would include individuals who are simply compelled by a \"lawful authority\" in response to \"subnormal intelligence, mental illness or incompetency\" to receive counseling. This means that any government entity, by compelling an individual to receive counseling, even without any professional diagnosis, can prohibit law-abiding citizens from possessing a firearm.\n \n Section 103(b) - Modifies the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1011 et seq.) by creating requirements that higher education institutions establish teams of \"educators, administrators, counselors, or other qualified members of the educational community\" to assess the mental health needs and safety risks posed by students. It also mandates the creation of multiple systems to report students to state or local health authorities for mandatory evaluation. This section would create teams of college professors who would have the power to determine the mental health needs and risks posed by students, perhaps those that do not agree with the professors politically or who exercise their First Amendment rights to speak out in support of their Second Amendment rights, and allow them a system to report these students to the government for evaluation.\n \n Section 104 - Lowers the threshold for individuals to be considered \"drug abusers and drug addicts who are prohibited from possessing firearms.\" The bill adds 18 U.S.C. 921(c)(1) and would include individuals who were arrested in the last five years, but not convicted, for the possession of drugs or drug paraphernalia and those who have failed a drug test or admitted to drug use in the past five years. In addition, if an individual is ordered by a court into a diversion program designed for addicts or abusers of controlled substances, whether or not they are convicted of any crime, they are added to the prohibited list. This section allows a wrongful arrest of a law-abiding citizen who is exonerated of their charges to still lose their right to keep and bear arms. \n\n Once the NICS improvement act was passed, I figure that the Antis were absolutely salivating, trying to figure out ways to add to those adjudicated mentally defective! \n \n Even worse, this bill doesn't even require the adjudication! \n \n All of the above is Without Due Process? \n \n A Constitutional Right!",

   "To answer NATO's question that started this thread, I think this law is a very bad idea. Chuck Schumer's senate version of the bill is currently in the judiciary committee. The committee has not taken action on it yet and it can certainly be rewritten as time goes on. However, the current text does contain the firearm prohibition for arrest: \n \n (a) Inferences of Abuse- Section 921 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following: \n (c) Unlawful User of Any Controlled Substance- \n `(1) IN GENERAL- An inference that a person is an unlawful user of a controlled substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802)) may be drawn based on-- \n `(A) a conviction for the use or possession of a controlled substance within the past 5 years; \n `(B) an arrest for the use or possession of a controlled substance within the past 5 years; \n `(C) an arrest for the possession of drug paraphernalia within the past 5 years, if testing has demonstrated the paraphernalia contained traces of a controlled substance; \n `(D) a drug test administered within the past 5 years demonstrating that the person had used a controlled substance unlawfully; or \n `(E) an admission to using or possessing a controlled substance unlawfully within the past 5 years. \n `(2) MEMBERS OF ARMED FORCES- For a current or former member of the Armed Forces, an inference that a person is an unlawful user of a controlled substance may be drawn based on disciplinary or other administrative action within the past 5 years based on confirmed use of a controlled substance, including a court-martial conviction, nonjudicial punishment, or an administrative discharge based on use of a controlled substance or drug rehabilitation failure.'. \n \n As I read part (c)(1)(B) it appears that an arrest for possession of drugs disqualifies a person, but an arrest for selling drugs-an accusation of being the actual dealer-is okay and does not disqualify a person from having a firearm.....\n \n My opinion of Chuck Schumer is he is no fool. I disagree with many things he says and does, but having seen him in action I respect his intelligence. I have a hard time believing that he does not know what is in a law he sponsors. \n \n But no matter what your view is of his intelligence I see only four reasons for the unconstitutional provision's existence...\n \n 1. He knows exactly what this language means, and he wants to keep it in the legislation because his belief in the cause is so strong that the end he seeks is worth the means of violating the due process rights of someone else; or\n 2. He knows exactly what this language means, but he does not intend to keep it. Rather, the provision was included only for the purpose of using it as a \"throw away\" provision-an \"I'll give this up and you give me something in return\" provision. Of course, this view suggests that he feels constitutional rights can be held hostage for use as legislative bargaining chips-that threatening constitutional rights is a valid means to compelling compromise with his views; or \n 3. He has no idea that this unconstitutional provision exists because he hasn't bothered to read the law and has no idea what his proposed legislation says or would do-that an overzealous or ignorant (or both) legislative aide has drafted this provision and Schumer is merely a \"blind deaf mute\" sponsor of the law; or \n 4. He knows the provision exists, but I am wrong about how smart he is and he really cannot understand how it violates the due process rights of gun buyers. \n \n Now I suppose that if Schumer is ever confronted about this proposed constitutional violation then he may simply blow it off by saying the bill is only a draft and would undergo changes as it makes its way through the byzantine process of reaching the president's desk. But let me quote a former SCOTUS justice:\n \n \"The great ideals of liberty and equality are preserved against the assaults of opportunism, the expediency of the passing hour, the erosion of small encroachments, the scorn and derision of those who have no patience with general principles, by enshrining them in constitutions, and consecrating to the task of their protection a body of defenders.\" Justice Benjamin Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process, Lecture II, 1921.\n \n Is it not Senator Schumer's duty as a representative of the people to be one of these defenders? I know we have a low opinion of our legislators, but has our view of their job performance sunk so low that it is too much to expect that they would never consciously propose a law that clearly violates our constitutional rights? \n \n When exactly did we consent to allowing our legislators to slip the bonds of their duty to respect the constitution-when did we reach a point where we began to tolerate the proposal of patently unconstitutional legislation under the belief that we would notice what our representatives were doing and make sure it was stricken from the bill before it was signed into law?\n \n Or, assuming (without really believing) that Schumer is clueless because of a lack of diligence, a lack of intelligence, or both, is it too much to expect our legislators to understand the laws they propose so we can ensure they do not unwittingly propose legislation that would violate a fundamental right? \n \n There is a reason why I don't watch how sausage is being made, and this is a prime example of why we must always watch how our laws are made.\n \n --- \n \n \"Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Government's purposes are beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil-minded rulers. The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding.\"--Olmstead v.

If the police will arrest a person for carrying out a fully legal practice that the Attorney General has gone on record as having stated is legal, even if they'll never be able to have you successfully prosecuted in a court of law, I highly doubt they'll be concerned about following the same practice with potential drug related charges.\n \n \nHow would that disqualification benefit the police?\n\n \n On the level of individual officers it doesn't.

Jason Berry with the agency's Government and Media Relations office (which was reproduced here)WA State Patrol issues mea culpa letter over AR-15 flap - Seattle gun rights | Examiner.com , still has not cooled the situation, as reported here Lawmakers riled up over WSP gun probe, but questions remain - Seattle gun rights | Examiner.com earlier.\n \n According to Calkins, an earlier suggestion that WSP had wanted names and other personal information on every AR-15 purchaser since last July 1 to see whether a particular name popped up was erroneous. He said the agency does not have a specific individual that they believe may have taken the missing AR-15 rifle at the center of this story. Indeed, Calkins acknowledged that the WSP is not really certain if the gun is actually missing, or just lost in an inventory mistake.\n \n \"We are hoping,\" he said in a telephone interview, \"that as embarrassing as it would be, that this was an inventory error.\"\n \n The WSP is preparing to send a follow-up \"clarification\" letter to all firearms dealers, which will better explain what information the agency is seeking, and the help it is asking, along with the serial number of the missing firearm. \n \n  In retrospect, after a week that has included a letter signed by 36 state senators and representatives to WSP Chief John Baptiste demanding an explanation, Calkins acknowledged, \"We touched a nerve here that we did not mean to touch.\"\n \n \"We don't have time for creating a registry,\" Calkins told the Gun Rights Examiner. \"We have no desire (to create a registry). What we want to do is an investigation that will help us find this gun, and if it was stolen by someone, hold them accountable.\"\n \n \n - Dave Workman, Author, Examiner\n \n So what is that \"plan\" you gungrabbers have for gun registry? The WSP \"lost\" one of it's guns or it got stolen by one of the only ones and they want to punish and collect information on everyone else for their incompetence. They should be investigating themselves! This is as wrong as the ATF gun smuggling.\n \n *produced in full for educational and scholarship use.",

So then the Cleveland cops CHANGED the charges to Concealed Carry. Why did they try that dodge? He carried in a Flap holster, totally visible to everyone, otherwise there would NOT have been the Call! And it was a HOT Cleveland afternoon, so no clothing was even available to cover it. emoticon_smile\n \n He chose the flap holster so no one could grab is gun, because he wanted to exercise his ABSOLUTE Right, so said the Ohio Supreme Court, as responsibly as he could have done so! \n \n The City of Cleveland had him jailed, charged, and jerked him around for just as many trial postponements, so they could run up the bill for his lawyer, just as high as they could, and for as long as they could possibly get away with, before totally doing what they obviously knew they would have had to do!

Just as Nato said could happen.\n \n In fact, just to show Cleveland and the Cleveland Police who wrong they are, Ohioans for Concealed Carry staged an Open Carry Walk around Cleveland for several hours, ending up in front of the Justice Center, which the Cleveland Police had to provide traffic control all of the while it was going on! emoticon_xhoho\n \n Here is another fact, a Cleveland Cop is one of the 3 original founders of OFCC.

The Constitution and it's Bill of Rights, is the supreme law of the land. Obey the law, even if you are in government or just a cop! You are NOT above it. \n \n Kudos Nato.

   "Ya know, (and I REALLY don't care if you believe me or not,) but I totally forgot about this plea until now. Now it is coming back. Pain meds, I guess. So my apologies. \n \nI must apologize for getting the outcome scrambled. It appears Greg successfully avoided the felony trial through a settlement in which he given court ordered \"diversion\", whatever that may be. \n\n Doc, Sinjin is speaking of this. Greg posted.   Ordered to Ground for Openly Carrying a Firearm \nI just got back from my court ordered CCW \"education\" class.(Tither's comments =< A 2nd Amendment Reeducation camp is more like it.) Part of the class consisted of everyone going around the room and explaining how they ended up there...\n \n There were at least three people who HAD their CHL's, and still got steamrolled by Cleveland's judicial system. They were following the law, and STILL ended up taking a plea bargain. Apparantly Cleveland does not back down from gun cases. (One unlucky soul may never be able to own a CHL again because he plead down to, \"aggravated menacing.\")\n \n Some guy cut him off on the highway, almost causing an accident, and he had to slam on his brakes to avoid crashing. In doing so, the boxes he was hauling for a friend he was moving spilled a bit, and a hair dryer happened to fall out, and he picked it up, and tossed it over his shoulder. Apparently the guy who cut him off thought it was a gun, as he glanced in his rearview mirror, and proceeded to call the police. He spent a few days in the slammer, and hired a lawyer, and got nowhere.\n (Insert his rant here)\n \n This needs to stop NOW. According to the public defender who ran the show today, if I didn't take diversion, I would have lost in court. Not sure how valid that statement is, but now that I have knowledge of other peoples horror stories, (He speaks of the page after page of police abuses on the OFCC website because they did not know Open carry was the LAW)  anyone who gets confronted by LEO's due to openly carrying, or even concealed WITH a license, should consider themselves VERY lucky to be able to walk away from the situation freely. Cleveland is corrupt (IMO). I don't think I am alone in saying this either. Never in my life have I been a criminal, and now I am treated like one. (And branded as one for now)\n \n Normal law abiding citizens are being arrested for practicing their 2a rights left and right. The sad thing is, you never hear their story. I was very lucky to escape with diversion. It could have been much worse.\n\n Honestly, I am very concerned about all of the above! \n \n Will Bird, a former ATF agent, and an OFCC member said \nI am saying he was forced into accepting a plea, if his pockets were deeper he would have had other options. In other words the Prosecutor just litigated him into bankruptcy. No doubt the flap holster clouded the issue enough that it reduced his chances of prevailing in court, BUT just like RDigital's case it would have had to go in front of a jury of his peers.\n\n Greg lost his job due to this charge and subsequent time loss, and was evicted from his apartment. I am told we are working on getting his record expunged. In other words Justice. \n \n So Nato's Point about being RailRoaded is something to be considered, especially if you live around Cleveland. For What Crime did Greg commit? None. \n \n Now the question should be, how do we stop over aggressive Anti-gun prosecutors who can make you life not worth living until you are out from under their thumbs! Bryan? By the way, Cleveland's mayor is one of Blomburgs Illegal mayors, and absolutely HATES the 2nd Amendment. I'm sure that doesn't help. \n \n Personally I would have never taken any deal, because in my mind, this one was a slam dunk, but it ain't my life I am risking! So the DA scares the living Heck out of Greg, postpones and postpones forever, and then offers you a plea bargain, and tells him all of this can go away if he takes it. Our lawyer told him not to take it, but it ain't our lives being risked. Just our money for the lawyer. Greg takes it, and said it was because, who knows about the judge. But it all goes away.\n \n After that incident, I took great amount of my time speaking to our Chief of Police who said that I could have knocked him over with a feather when he found out that everything I was telling him was a fact about Open Carrying being a legal activity. I don't know if all of that is true or not, but he personally instructed his officers that Terry stops were not even a legal avenue, and instructed his dispatchers on what to tell citizens if they ever see someone open carrying in Fairview Park. I just didn't what anyone suing our city for documented false arrest as our OFCC members were Open Carrying with tape recorders for their own protection. We have several tapes of stops. Some egregious, some not too bad. But all were terry stopped. That's Illegal!!!!\n \n Hey Sinjin. Say hello to Shadow for me. Thanks.",

   "It appears Cleveland had every intention of prosecuting. Does the local ordinance prohibiting open carry still stand? \n\n First of all, there is preemption in Ohio. Cleveland lost in a case OFCC brought before the court. Then Cleveland appealed, and the Ohio AG took over the defense, and Cleveland LOST that one too. Strike 3, Cleveland is out of gas! Cleveland does not have the right to make that law. \n \n But most importantly, Greg and all Open Carriers did so after the Supreme Court said Open Carry was a Constitutionally protected Right. That means everywhere in Ohio. PERIOD! The AG even sent out a letter informing all cities of this. \n \n Succinctly as possible, The Ohio Supreme Court said that the legislature, in passing laws against concealed carry without a permit, did so because concealed carry posed a greater risk to the police and society. Under the rules of scrutiny, the Concealed Carry law was constitutional because, the avenue to Open Carry was available to every citizen, thus satisfying the Constitution's meaning to the Right to Keep and Bear Arms. Scalea also mentioned this case in Heller. That is how much of a president this was in the U.S. Supreme Courts mind! In my opinion, that is also why Scalea said Concealed Carry was not a constitutionally protected Right in the U.S.. Kline v. Lis. \n \n \n I gather the flap holster was considered \"concealing\"? \n\n Not in any reasonable person's mind. Would you consider this concealed carry? ==<Amazon.com: Galati Gear Military Flap Holster: Sports & Outdoors Can you say Railroaded? The flap holster does help protect from someone just coming up and taking your gun from you, if you are unaware. If you ask me, Greg was being more responsible in his Open carry right.\n \n \nWas Greg attempting to protest the ordinance? \n\n Nope. He was just following the law, and exercising his Inalienable Constitutionally recognized as protected from this kind of railroading abuse from governments, as a listed condition for the delegated powers needed, to operate with the tremendously Awesome power and authority that a government can wield. Or if corrupt, can abuse! \n \nNATO suggested that arrests followed by the charges being dropped would be used to deny folks the ability to buy guns. \n This was not such a case. \n\n THIS was a perfect example if being railroaded by someone with a grunge against gun owners. Heck he was railroaded, and denied his Constitutionally protected Right. Give Anti-gun people this kind of power, and if corrupt, they will abuse it! This is the Classic, and the perfect, example of why giving this kind of power to governments, over and against an Inalienable, Constitutionally recognized as protected from government and anti-gunners, Right, is stupid and foolish! \n \n \nHow long would Greg have been waiting for his permit? \n\n Not a relevant question. He did not need to have a permit to Open Carry. EVER! He is a citizen of Ohio. That is his Right which the Ohio Constitution calls Inalienable, if the Cops follow the law. And THAT is the real question and problem here!\n \n Or do you want to agree to let the cities and the police make up their own laws, and you can find out what they are when they chose them for your particular circumstance? Does anyone want to live like that? Anarchy! And that is also the perfect explanation of why preemption is needed, and necessary.",

   "NATO suggested that arrests followed by the charges being dropped would be used to deny folks the ability to buy guns.\n \n \n Actually Sinjin I was raising a point about Schumer's proposed bill. And the language if his proposed bill as currently written specifies that a simple arrest for a drug related charge automatically moves you to the prohibited person's list in the NICS background check system. Even if you were found not guilty, even if the charges were dropped, even if the case was dismissed and you could never be tried for the same crime again because double jeopardy was in place it wouldn't matter because the record of that arrest will remain and be used against you later in the future.\n \n And since the authorities are alerted to when anybody fails a NICS background check the police would have to get involved and potentially harass someone who was arrested but never tried or acquitted.\n \n You introduced the argument that the police wouldn't be carrying out false arrests under orders from higher ups because that would open them up to false arrest lawsuits and would be of no benefit. So I introduces the antics of the Ohio police to show how the police will use their authority to railroad you if given the opportunity. And they did even if the practice is not only legally protected but constitutionally recognized. They were without a leg to stand on legally and the cases would never withstand scrutiny, the Attorney General even told them they had no grounds for arrests, but they proceeded anyway.\n \n I believe that would be enough evidence to at least reasonably suggest that should Schumer's bill come into fruition as currently written the police would have no trouble busting you for charges of drug possession or drug paraphernalia, even if they could never bring it to court and win the case. They wouldn't need to since the simple matter of the arrest record would be the only thing needed to disqualify you from future gun ownership.\n \n \nThis was not such a case.\n\n \n This was not the case simply because Schumer's bill isn't currently law...yet.",
