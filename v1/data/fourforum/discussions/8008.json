We have technology to get the oil, it is just not cost effective. If it isn't cost effective, there is no point. We need technology improvements to make the process cost effective.\n \n Like the tar sands, the price point at which it becomes cost effective keeps moving due ot the energy intensive nature of the extraction. The other major problem with this is the same as our problems with coal liquification. All of our pipelines are essentially desinged and constructed to carry oil and petroleum products from our coasts to certain inland locations. Our shale oil deposits are all inland. SO, we need new pipelines, or pipeline extensions. We also need all new refineries inland, beucase our pipleins do not generally transport crude oil.\n \n We are talkign MAJOR infrastructure alterations JUST to exploit the shale. 20-30 yrs and several trillion owuld be a conservative estimate, and we have neither the time nor the money to do this.",

   "Dear Readers\n Gas is a high priced cash crop these days. I want to know what solutions you have in mind. Gas might always be high because we are a big country and growing. \n There is a supply and demand factor. No brainer on that one. But, gas is not running out. Gas won't for a long time. If you are one of those people that beleives that it is, you are either a retard or just plain stupid. But, Amerikans need to build more oil rigs and refineries. My research says that Amerika has not built a oil rig in 20-30 years. I might be wrong. Granted, I am a Russian immigrant, I am only 17, and was not around then. But, I am certain that we need more. If we drilled in Alaska, the price would drop. There is a lot of oil in Alaska. But, people are debating the risks and stuff, and so far is not making headway. But, we need to find an alternative fuel, or find a way to get gas down.\n Personally, I think gas should go down, and the motor companies and our government should be finding alternative ways to drive. Gas is a pollutant when burned, and it is ruining the planet. I am a beleiver in all that mumbo jumbo, and I think a cleaner fuel is needed now!\n What should we do people? What should we do to end these horrific prices? Gas just went up here, and it is now three dollars and twelve cents a galon, and yesterday when I filled up, it cost me nearly fifty five dollars just to get a ful tank of gas. I can not have prices like this. I need my car to get to work, and to get around. \n Plus, tourist season is starting. All them tourists come out to look at Mount Rushmore, go minin in Keystone, gift shoppin, devils tower, etc etc. Our city rely's on the tourist season for money. If gas is so expensive, our tourist season will suck as it did last year.\n -Sergei\n\n \n Of course if, in the 70's, we had done something about this, like Brazil, then there wouldn't be a problem. Forced the car companies to up gas mileage, started the switch to Ethanol, or seriously looked into Alternatives. It is possible to run a car on water but that Technology has been surpressed.",

Then your supply and demand theory would favor better control of pricing since we would be the majority of the \"demand\".",
