It doesn't have anything to do with chords. What I believe you are thinking of is where chords are shown above lyrics to show how to play a song. That is something of a musical cheat sheet, which guitarists use all the time, but is not tablature. This can be used to play songs on piano (or any other instrument for that matter), but is not specific to piano.",

Above the measures you see symbols like: CM = C major, cm= c minor, CM6=C major chord, first inversion (bottom note, the C, is played in the soprano). Or do you see Roman numerals like IV, V, VI? Those are the...\n \n Oh, geesh, go get a theory book. :) Or you can go to http://www.musictheory.net for help with this. Good luck!",
