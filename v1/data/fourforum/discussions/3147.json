   "Do you think that Republicans finally clued in to what David Horowitz says in this article?\n http://www.taemag.com/issues/articleid.17180/article_detail.asp\n \n\n 1. Politics is war conducted by other means. In political warfare you do not fight just to prevail in an argument, but to destroy the enemy's fighting ability. Conservatives often seem to regard political combat as they would debates before the Oxford Political Union, as though winning depends on rational arguments and carefully articulated principles. But the audience of politics is not made up of Oxford dons, and the rules are entirely different. \n \n 2. Politics is a war of position. In war there are two sides: friends and enemies. Your task is to define yourself as the friend of as large a constituency compatible with your principles as possible, while defining your opponent as their enemy wherever and whenever you can. The act of defining combatants is analogous to the military concept of choosing the terrain of battle. Choose the ground that makes the fight as \"rigged\" in your favor as possible. \n \n But be careful. American politics takes place in a pluralistic framework, where constituencies are diverse and often in conflict. Therefore \"fairness\" and \"tolerance\" are the formal rules of democratic engagement. If you appear mean-spirited, nasty, or too judgmental, it will make the task easier for your opponent to define you as a threat, and therefore as \"the enemy.\" \n \n 3. In political wars, the aggressor usually prevails. Conservatives often wait for the other side to attack. In football, this is known as a \"prevent defense.\" In politics, it is the strategy of losers. \n \n By striking first, you can define the issues and define your adversary. Definition is the decisive move in all political wars. Other things being equal, whoever winds up on the defensive will generally be on the losing side. \n \n 4. Position is defined by fear and hope. The twin emotions of politics are fear and hope. Those who provide people with hope become their friends; those who inspire fear become enemies. Of the two, hope is the better choice. \n\n \n \nWhen you do get to speak, don't forget that a sound bite is all you have. Whatever you have to say, make sure to say it loud and clear. Keep it simple and keep it short. (A slogan is always better.) Repeat it often. Put it on television. Radio is good, but with a few exceptions, only television reaches a public that is electorally significant. In politics, television is reality. \n\n \n \nConservatives should make \"Left,\" \"Radical Left,\" and \"Far Left\" reflexive labels for describing those who belong to what is now blandly called liberalism. They should practice referring to Maxine Waters as \"my opponent from the far Left,\" and to \"my left-wing colleagues Bernie Sanders and Barney Frank.\" Don't blame the media for describing leftists as \"liberals\" while letting them off the hook yourself. \n\n \n \nLook at Clinton and ask yourself: How does he do it? How does he boff an intern in the White House, perjure himself before a grand jury, lie to the American people, and prevail in political combat at the same time? The answer is the children. The answer is the blacks. The answer is the poor. It's the Democratic version of wrapping yourself in the American flag. Like every successful Democrat, Clinton wraps himself in the flag of the \"dispossessed.\" He says: \"However badly you think of me, I'm all that stands between women, children, minorities, and the poor and those mean-spirited conservatives, who are probably racists as well.\" Until the Republican Party takes this weapon out of the Democratic arsenal, conservatives are doomed to long-term defeat. If Republicans don't convince the American people they care, conservatives will only win when liberals screw up. \n\n \n \n So do you think the Repuplicans finally started to listen to this kind of \"common sense\"? Because they have certainly mastered EVERY single one of these.",
