   "My dad showed me this thing on the Al Franken show (yes I know, really liberally biased). It had a high school journalist say he was interested in joining the army and he recorded a couple of phone conversations. In one they said they wouldn't have a problem with him faking a diploma (forget the name, some religious name) that no one ever checks those things anyway. He said he had some marijuana problems and the recruiter specifically told him of something he could take that would help him pass the drug test. There were a couple of other things as well, but does anyone else think this is wrong?",

   "Here's the story by CBS news\n \n (CBS) Seventeen-year-old high school journalist and honor student David McSwane is just what Army recruiters are looking for, but he suspected they might be lowering their standards, reports Rick Sallinger of CBS News Denver affiliate KCNC. \n \n \"I wanted to see how far the army would go during a war to get one more soldier,\" McSwane said. \n \n So he showed up at a Golden Colorado recruiting office saying he was a dropout. \n \n No problem, the recruiter said - and told McSwane in a phone call he recorded - to create a fake diploma from a non-existent school. \n \n \"It can be like Faith Hill Baptist School or something - whatever you choose,\" the recruiter said. \n \n So McSwane went on-line, got a phony grade transcript and a diploma with the name of the school the recruiter suggested and turned it in. \n \n \"I was shocked. I'm sitting there looking at a poster that says 'Integrity, Honor, Respect,' and he is telling me to lie,\" McSwane said. \n \n Then the high school senior told the recruiter: \n \n \"I have a problem with drugs. I can't kick the habit - just marijuana.\" \n \n The recruiter suggested purchasing a detoxification kit. \n \n \"The two times I had the guys use it - it's worked both times. We didn't have to worry about anything,\" the recruiter said. \n \n McSwane had a friend take a video as another recruiter, Sgt. Tim Pickel, took him to buy the so-called detox kit. \n Sallinger confronted Sgt. Pickel with a phone conversation David McSwane said he had before they went to the store. \n \n On tape: \n \n Sgt Pickel: \"When you said about the one problem that you had...what does it consist of?\" \n \n McSwane: \"Marijuana.\" \n \n Pickel: \"Oh. OK. So nothing major?\" \n \n McSwane: \"Yeah he said he would take me down to get that stuff. I mean I have no idea what it is so you would have to show me. Is that a problem?\" \n \n Pickel: \"No, not at all.\" \n \n Sgt. Pickel quickly referred us to his superiors. \n \n Lt. Colonel Jeffrey Brodeur who heads Army recruiting for the Colorado region did not defend the recruiters. \n \n \"Let me tell you something sir. I'm a soldier and have been a soldier for 20 years,\" Broderu said. \"This violates trust, it violates integrity, it violates honor, and it violates duty.\" \n \n The two soldiers involved have already been suspended from recruiting duties. They could face anything from a letter of reprimand to a court martial if they are not cleared by the investigation. \n \n http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/05/02/eveningnews/main692497.shtml",

At the cannon fodder end, no education, no experience, no intellect required. That's what they're paid to do.
