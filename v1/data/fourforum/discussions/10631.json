   "Let me comment you, Charliegone, on a very reasonable post. It didn't raise the hairs on the back of my neck. I grew up with firearms in the house. I think that one of the reasons that I did so well in firearms training in the Army was that I was used to shooting a rifle. Others in my company were not. Thus, I spent a lot of time loading magazines since I passed out on the first attempt at every test. I qualified with the M-1 carbine (.30 cal.), M-1 Garand (.30 cal), M-14 rifle (7.62 mm), M-60 machine gun (7.62 mm - a sweet weapon. Much nicer than the M-14 on auto), and the M1911A1 (.45 cal. semi automatic - a son-of-a-buck that would take chunks out of the skin between thumb and index finger if gripped wrong and was hard on the wrist) - (all at various levels of expertise).\n \nOk, I'll bite. I agree we should have some control, but not to the point where we have to ban stuff. That's just stupid and draconian.\nIndeed. The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a 2nd Amendment challenge to such draconian laws in Washington, D.C. The laws there are a total ban on firearms to the extent that a special police officer is forbidden to have an assembled and loaded weapon in his home. He is one of the \"et al\" in Parker et al. v. District of Colombia.\n \nHere's some of the stuff I can agree with.\n \n -Background checks. Instant check would be preferred. There is no proof waiting periods work.\nOn the other hand, there isn't any proof that any checks work or are actually worked. There have been several cases in the past where convicted felons bought guns \"legally\", even after a waiting period. The problem was that gun dealers weren't really paying attention to any kind of checks, even after a waiting period. I believe the problem has been much reduced in recent years since the gun dealer now goes to jail for selling a gun to a felon if he should have been aware that the purchaser was a felon.\n \n But that is neither here nor there to your point. I actually don't know if the waiting period actually results in a better background investigation. Perhaps someone else has some actual data.\n \n-More background checks for Machine guns. I'm perfectly fine with that. Banning them? No.\nI'm not sure why owning a machine gun is desirable. I'm pretty sure it isn't a hunting weapon.\n \n-A record of those who have had/or have mental illnesses. This is perfectly reasonable, but it also requires the help of the citizens to help the person in need.\nBut on the other hand, you are willing to violate a person's right to privacy (medical records) in order to limit their access to firearms. Which right is more important? - Your right to privacy or your right to own a machine gun?\n \n-CCW license for those that wish to carry on them. With a class on how to handle and asses situations would be in need.\nI presume you mean \"access\". In my state, in order to carry a concealed weapon on your person you must have a license. Classes of several hours are required for such a license and the classes must be repeated at intervals. However, in my state I may have a concealed firearm in my car (it must be concealed) as long as I do not engage in criminal activity, am not a member of a criminal gang, and am not a convicted felon.\n \n There are no restrictions on what weapons I possess in my home, with the exception of those banned by federal law.\n \nThings I would never be for.\n \n -ban on \"assault weapons.\" Purely cosmetic, it makes no difference if it has a pistol grip or not it's still semi-automatic.\nI think the ban in some places is more a matter of full automatic weapons. I don't know. Do some places ban the possession of an AK-47 or an M-16? Semi-automatic, fine. But, of course, they can be \"fixed\" by filing the sheer pin. What would be the possible use of a full automatic weapon?\n \n-ban on handguns on a safety list. We have this in California, and it's more like an extortion list. If the manufacturer doesn't pay the money to have it on the list, it can no longer be for sale in the state of California...yeah sounds like extortion to me\nSounds strange to me.

   "\n Indeed. The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a 2nd Amendment challenge to such draconian laws in Washington, D.C.

I believe the problem has been much reduced in recent years since the gun dealer now goes to jail for selling a gun to a felon if he should have been aware that the purchaser was a felon.\n \n True there is no real evidence or information to support that, but let's think this through. If a felon knows he can legally buy a gun because there is no background check, I'm sure as hell know he would do it. Since it would be similar to buying a bag chips at the store, there is no difference. It would fall down in complete public and government scrutiny.\n \n But that is neither here nor there to your point. I actually don't know if the waiting period actually results in a better background investigation. Perhaps someone else has some actual data.\n \n Waiting periods are a different story. With the way technology is today, waiting periods are obsolete. The problem arises when officials do NOT do their job like they are suppose to. In the Virginia Tech's killer's case, Cho was found to be a danger to himself and others, yet why didn't law enforcement act upon it? Where were the RO's? \n \n I'm not sure why owning a machine gun is desirable. I'm pretty sure it isn't a hunting weapon.\n \n There is nothing in the constitution about hunting now is there? Guns aren't just for hunting, they are also used for various other things. Some people enjoy letting of a few rounds at the range, others enjoy trap shooting, other's enjoy going to that Knob Creek machine gun shoot every year. As long as they go through the procedures, what's the big deal? Like I said, please tell me of how many instances there have been when a single legally held machine gun was used to kill someone or go on a murdering spree? Besides, machine guns aren't cheap, they costs thousands and thousands of dollars.\n \n \n But on the other hand, you are willing to violate a person's right to privacy (medical records) in order to limit their access to firearms. Which right is more important? - Your right to privacy or your right to own a machine gun?\n I presume you mean \"access\". \n \n I guess I must have written that incorrectly. I would say this would only apply if someone is found by a court to be mentally unfit. Than I would yes.\n \n In my state, in order to carry a concealed weapon on your person you must have a license. Classes of several hours are required for such a license and the classes must be repeated at intervals. However, in my state I may have a concealed firearm in my car (it must be concealed) as long as I do not engage in criminal activity, am not a member of a criminal gang, and am not a convicted felon.\n \n True each state has different requirements, that's why it should be left to states. Just recently we saw or heard a good example of how CCW works in situations like that of the recent church shootings.\n \n There are no restrictions on what weapons I possess in my home, with the exception of those banned by federal law.\n I think the ban in some places is more a matter of full automatic weapons. I don't know. Do some places ban the possession of an AK-47 or an M-16? Semi-automatic, fine. But, of course, they can be \"fixed\" by filing the sheer pin. What would be the possible use of a full automatic weapon?\n Sounds strange to me. But your legislators must have had a very good reason for passing such laws. Remember, they are looking out for you good.\n \n Legislators pass laws because they want to keep their jobs. That's it. If they were truly looking out for the common \"man\" they would do their research first than make up the law, but that isn't the case with most gun control (dare I say all?) Most control is just feel good politics nothing more.\n \n That may be true, but many of those deaths are children who don't know how to handle guns except for TV. A couple such deaths are reported in my city every year, one recently was the child of a police officer. I'm educated enough to know that removing the magazine doesn't mean that the gun is unloaded. Others aren't. I'm not sure that any mandatory gun modifications would make a difference.\n \n That is why a gun owner should always follow the rules. These rules have always been there. If the owner does not follow through with their responsibilities it's their fault. Not mine, not the other guy who has no children in his home, why should I have to suffer for the stupidity of one person? Is that really a fair judgment? The gun will still fire even with these things in place, so why do they even pass these insane laws? Again it's just feel good politics.\n \n Then you are saying that, after all, you prefer a ban?\n\n \n Nope. I'm just saying reasonable controls (no bans, silly requirements, etc) within the constitution that's all. Bans are a no go for me. They solve nothing and make matters a lot worse. Want an example? Prohibition.\n \n BTW Kesseltron, please, please show me an instance that a legally held machine gun has been used to commit a crime. I'm sure you will find there are very very few or none at all.",

   "Pandion lets get some facts straight. First semi autos can not be made to go full auto by fileing down the sear it is more involved than that. Legal machine guns fall under the NFA and are registered with BATFE. The back ground chk for a machine gun is extensive and requires your local CLEO to sign off on every gun you purchase. These guns have to be stored so that no one but the owner can have access to them. Once you are approved by the BATFE to own one you are no longer a name less face in this country every federal agency knows who you are and what you have. The guns are expensive since in 1968 imports of them for civilan purchase was banned and in 1986 the new registration of guns able to be owned by civilians was also banned.there are only apx. 350,000 registered MGN's available for public ownership. I know about them because I am an owner. If you don't beleave me go to this link.. trigger\n \n http://www.youtube.com/Trigger51B\n \n BTW Kesseltron, please, please show me an instance that a legally held machine gun has been used to commit a crime. I'm sure you will find there are very very few or none at all.\n \n To answer this there is only one but not realy. The gun in question was a police dept. weapon that was used by an officer that wasn't licenced or had permission to have the gun. What he did with it was not made clear but a crime was committed we do not know what it was...",

   "Alright this is where I'm most at home on the board, this is my opinion on gun control.\n \n The only gun control that I feel we need in this country is the basic background check, and serious penalties relating exclusively to criminals who possess firearms.\n \n We need to scale back the list of prohibited people, in such that we repeal the Lautenburg Amendment. As it is right now anybody charged (but not found guilty) of domestic violence is banned for life from being in possession of a firearm. Even if the charge is later found to be false and made by a nut with a history of lying, the charge remains on your record and is EXTREMELY hard to ever get expunged.\n \n We need to limit the power of the BATFE and scale them back to a more controlled and managle level. Currently they have outright control over everything regarding firearms and has constantly contradicted itself, and harmed innocent people. They treat a paperwork error as a willful violation of federal law and revoke FFL licenses on a whim, they don't even follow their own guidelines.\n \n We need to change how something qualifies as a destructive device, AOW, or short barreled shotgun or rifle. We should also see about removing some of the things on the list.\n \n We should end the 1986 machinegun ban so people can buy new machineguns of modern design; nobody's being killed with the pre '86 version, why would post '86 models be unreasonable?\n \n We need to stop the nonsense of banning \"assault weapons\" closing the \"gunshow loophole\" licensing and registering firearms and ammunition in any and all forms, requiring gun owners to report their firearms lost or stolen within 72 hours, ending firearms preemption, banning ammunition that can penetrate police body armor, and all that other nonsense! We need to do away with it because it amounts to absolutely NOTHING!\n \n What we really need to do is get very tough on crime, to the point where it borders on cruel and unusual punishment. From now on we need to put an immediate end to all plea deals, suspended sentences and parole for criminals with firearms charges against them. Armed criminals need a minimum of five years just for being armed, gun traffickers need a minimum of ten years for every gun illegally bought and trafficked, these need to be mandatory on state levels, etc.\n \n I'm tired of pandering to the criminals while gun owners are violated by the law. It has to stop!",
