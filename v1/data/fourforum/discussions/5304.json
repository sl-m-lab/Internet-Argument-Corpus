And I used to think Communism was bad.\n ==========================\n \n The Murder of a Muslim Woman \n By Jody K. Biehl\n Spiegel Online | May 19, 2005\n \n In the past four months, six Muslim women living in Berlin have been brutally murdered by family members. Their crime? Trying to break free and live Western lifestyles. Within their communities, the killers are revered as heroes for preserving their family dignity. How can such a horrific and shockingly archaic practice be flourishing in the heart of Europe? The deaths have sparked momentary outrage, but will they change the grim reality for Muslim women?\n \n Hatin Surucu just wanted to live her own life. Instead, she became Berlin's latest victim of honor killings. Her Turkish Muslim brothers allegedly gunned her down for adopting Western ways.\n \n Hatin Surucu just wanted to live her own life. Instead, she became Berlin's latest victim of honor killings. Her Turkish Muslim brothers allegedly gunned her down for adopting Western ways.\n \n The shots came from nowhere and within minutes the young Turkish mother standing at the Berlin bus stop was dead. A telephone call from a relative had brought her to this cold, unforgiving place. She thought she would only be gone for a few minutes and wore a light jacket in the freezing February wind. She had left her five-year-old son asleep in his bed. He awoke looking for his mother, who, like many Turkish women in Germany, harbored a secret life of fear, courage and, ultimately, grief. Now her little boy has his own tragedy to bear: His mother, Hatin Surucu, was not the victim of random violence, but likely died at the hands of her own family in what is known as an \"honor killing.\"\n \n Hatin's crime, it appears, was the desire to lead a normal life in her family's adopted land. The vivacious 23-year-old beauty, who was raised in Berlin, divorced the Turkish cousin she was forced to marry at age 16. She also discarded her Islamic head scarf, enrolled in a technical school where she was training to become an electrician and began dating German men. For her family, such behavior represented the ultimate shame -- the embrace of \"corrupt\" Western ways. Days after the crime, police arrested her three brothers, ages 25, 24 and 18. The youngest of the three allegedly bragged to his girlfriend about the Feb. 7 killing. At her funeral, Hakin's Turkish-Kurdish parents draped their only daughter's casket in verses from the Koran and buried her according to Muslim tradition. Absent of course, were the brothers, who were in jail.\n \n The crime might be easier to digest if it had been an archaic anomaly, but five other Muslim women have been murdered in Berlin during the past four months by their husbands or partners for besmirching the family's Muslim honor...\n \n (Snip)\n \n The response among Germany's devout Muslims is equally tough to gauge as there is no single organization the community looks to for leadership. Instead, the community is divided into about three dozen groups, each with its own leadership. Ali Kizilkaya, the chairman of the Council of Islam, one of the largest umbrella organizations, has decried Hatin's murder as \"an abuse and affront to the Muslim religion.\" He insists Islam does not condone honor killings.\n \n But try telling that, said Boehmecke, to the hoards of young boys who taunt Turkish girls in schools and their families who tacitly encourage such behavior. Educators at the grassroots say their numbers are rising, she says. Indeed, the German weekly Die Zeit reports that the percent of schoolgirls wearing headscarves in the Berlin district where Hatin was killed has gone from virtually none to about 40 percent in the past three years. Which one of today's smiling schoolgirls, Boehmecke wonders, will be next year's victim of honor?\n \n http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=18105",

Why these people insist on living two centuries behind the rest of civilization is beyond me.\n \n I thought we had it bad with our religious extremists taunting people who don't adhere to their moral beliefs and standards. But this is small potatoes compared to the extremes those people take it. It's one thing to taunt women at abortion clinics or harass homosexuals, but to kill your own sister? Totally unacceptable. Neither examples are acceptable but like I said, the Hajii's are downright barbaric. Our extremists may be annoying butt holes but at least they don't kill people (except sometimes.....)\n \n How can Europe allow such infiltration from Islam? I hope that never happens here but I bet it does eventually. I am glad to see that those brothers have to answer to the law. If that were Pakistan or Afghanastan, they would get off scott free.\n \n I hope that we eventually close our borders. I really do.",

   "That shows that cultures changes over time. 50 Years ago an African American dating a white girl in the south would have a very hard time if not face death. That is not common now. As muslims, Hindu's and Sihks emmigrate to western countries they still have much of their cultural background regarding issues. \n \n It takes time for those attitudes to change, good public schools that are not segregated will only help that. Overall the only thing Europe has to fear from Muslims is the same thing that Canada and the US has concerns over. The US is facing a changing culture due to latino immigration, Canada is changing from being a Anglo-french country, to something entirely different.

Me and LT talked about cultural influences and I pointed out that the anglo-saxon influence on my culture is percieved as a greater problem than the arab or muslim influence (which is virtualy non-existant). Eting habits is just one examples how the anglo-saxon culture influences my own. There are naturally positive aspects of this influence, but the same is true about the marginal arab/muslim influence.\n \n I don`t see how me posting this trivializes anything.\n\n \n But you have control over what you put into your mouth. You have eyes and ears to study nutrition and what is good or not for you.\n \n Those victims on 9/11 had no such opportunity to make any choices except to be incinerated or jumping out of a 110 story building.\n ============================\n Desperation forced a horrific decision\n By Dennis Cauchon and Martha Moore, USA TODAY\n \n At first, it seemed like debris. Large objects were falling from the top of the World Trade Center's north tower, just a few minutes after American Airlines Flight 11 hit.\n \n The sight of people plunging from the north tower compelled hundreds in the south tower to flee before the second jet struck the building. \n \n \"It took three or four to realize: They were people,\" says James Logozzo, who had gathered with co-workers in a Morgan Stanley boardroom on the 72nd floor of the south tower, just 120 feet away from the north tower. \"Then this one woman fell.\"\n \n (Snip)\n \n Eric Thompson, who worked on the 77th floor of the south tower, went to a conference room window after the first jet hit. He was shocked when a man came to a north tower window and leapt from a few floors above the fire. Thompson looked the man in the face. He saw his tie flapping in the wind. He watched the man's body strike the pavement below. \"There was no human resemblance whatsoever,\" Thompson says.\n \n http://images.usatoday.com/news/sept11/2002-09-02-jumper.jpg\n \n http://www.usatoday.com/news/sept11/2002-09-02-jumper_x.htm",
