   "Study says gay soldiers don't disrupt military | News Story on 365gay.com\n \n \n By Jennifer Vanasco, editor in chief, 365gay.com\n 02.22.2010 12:51pm EST\n \n A new Palm Center study on foreign militaries says that a quick transition to gay and lesbian inclusivity isn't disruptive.\n Send / Share\n Add Comment\n Says the New York Times:\n \n The finding is in direct opposition to the stated views of Pentagon leaders, who say repealing a ban on openly gay men and women in the United States armed forces should take a year or more.\n \n The study, \"Gays in Foreign Militaries 2010: A Global Primer,\" is to be released Tuesday by the Palm Center, a research group at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\n \n The Palm Center has no official position on \"don't ask, don't tell,\" the American law that bans openly gay service members, but the group has become a leading force among advocates for repeal. The principal author of the study is Nathaniel Frank, who also wrote the book \"Unfriendly Fire: How the Gay Ban Undermines the Military and Weakens America.\"\n \n The 151-page study . . . . concludes that in foreign militaries, openly gay service members did not undermine morale, cause large resignations or mass \"comings out.\" The report found that \"there were no instances of increased harassment\" . . . . and none of the countries studied installed separate facilities for gay troops, and that benefits for gay partners were generally in accordance with a country's existing benefits for gay and lesbian couples.\n \n On implementation, the study said that most countries made the change swiftly, within a matter of months and with what it termed little disruption to the armed services.\n \n In other gays-in-the-military news, Sen. Joe Liberman told the Daily News this morning that he will be the one to introduce a bill in the Senate to repeal \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell.\"\n \n He said: \"What matters is not the gender of the other person in your unit or the color or the religion or in this case the sexual orientation. It's whether that person is a good soldier you can depend on. And that's why I think it's going to work.\"",

It means that since 800 of these jobs were deemed critical to our success on the battlefield more taxpayers money must be spent on re training new people to fill the gap, and the one thing we don't have a luxury in war is time....",
