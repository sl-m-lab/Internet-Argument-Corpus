   "Here is another great example of parents and their bigoted views. You have to be kidding me! These are 6th graders! Now you have to get a parents permission to have a talk about anti-bullying if it involves being nice to gay people amongst other topics. This happens to be state law in Vermont. The parents again want to be the one to discuss these things. Just exactly what would they say I wonder? Would they discuss how Jesus said to treat others like you would want to be treated? Why in the world would they want to exclude this topic unless they wanted to continue the bigoted ways of our society? Would they have complained if gays were not mentioned and it only involved drugs, alchohol, tobacco and other like subjects? I think not. As far as the parent that says she if from the old school, I don't get it. Almost 20 years ago there were lots of speakers that spoke at my school on various subjects my mom never had a clue about. This is really getting ridiculous!",

Jyoshu is going to come out and tell us that some parents could be objecting because they want the parents to teach their kids a MORE RESTRICTIVE policy against anti-gay bullying than the school was going to...\n \n And that is a reason for dissension...\n emoticon_rolleyes",
