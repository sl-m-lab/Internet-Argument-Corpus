   "The death of Terry Shiavo is a travesty that demands justice. How a completely coherent woman could be tortured through starvation in America is beyond my compehension. I thought American justice was above torture; I guess I was wrong.\n The perpetrators of this crime ( her husband and the judges.) should be prosecuted under the eighth amendment for cruel and unusual punishment. It is sad that it is illegal to starve a dog, but starving a human is just fine. Left-wing liberals, who should be known as the pro-death political mafia, decry the death penalty for savage murderers, but put their blessing on the agony and death of an innocent woman. What hypocrisy!!!\n It is time for America to wake up. Our unelected judges wield too much power, power the constitution does not grant them. It won't be long before these judges start pronouncing death to people because they do not like their political views, religious views, or even the color of their eyes. May God have mercy on the soul of America.",

   "\n The perpetrators of this crime ( her husband and the judges.) should be prosecuted under the eighth amendment for cruel and unusual punishment. \n\n \n The trouble with the US constitution is that half the people who cite it as justification for their argument don't have a clue what they are talking about.\n Nobody was punishing Terri, therefore your argument falls flat on its butt.\n \n If you want to make such rash statements,take it back to the core argument, the right to food.Feeding someone is not medical care, it's a basic function of life.\n \n At the 1996 World Food Summit, leaders from 185 countries and the European Community reaffirmed, in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security, \"the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger.\" \n \n which would cover it nicely,except the US stands virtually alone in not ratifying the treaty.The current administration fought hard to get the principles of the summit watered down to a level of virtual meaninglesness,but at the end of the day was not one of the 182 countries that signed up.Seems odd then, that Congress will go out of its way to establish new legislation to try to argue in favor of feeding one individual.\n \n Back to the quote from Hunter - Please quote the statute that you believe is being violated.Believing an act to be a crime does not make it so.",
