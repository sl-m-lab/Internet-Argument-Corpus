   "Definitely America has been not only testing climatic weapons but using them in reality as well. In the result we face those \"natural\" disasters. I mean those present heavy floods in Europe. Not that they are using it against Europe (I'd hate to think American dislike of Europeans has reached that dangerous proportion). America has been preparing to war on Iran just. And they must be using same weather technology as they applied before their Iraqi military operation. Do you remember the flood of 2002 in Europe? At that time Americans needed suitable climatic changes to make war activities in Iraqi soil possible. This was cost of such preparations. \n What I think is that USA is in possession of climatic weapon. Though called \"nonlethal\" it kills people in big numbers! Thus we should call this sort of weapon WMD! \n So Americans have been using WMD!!\n I've read up in the net that American High-Frequency Active Research Program which is under way in US may well trigger floods, droughts, hurricanes and earthquakes. Why not reach the goal while staying in the shade far away from 'natural disasters'? And Americans are cynical enough to deliver humanitarian aid to victims on top of that.",

   "First of all, let me just say that I am affended at the term \"Yankees\" in refering to Americans. I can't stand the Yankeesemoticon_angry. Please choose another Baseball team.\n \n By the way, don't think that all of America is out to get you. Its probibly just the annoying ones we have in the White House. And if we had climatic weapons, then why would we have gone after our selves? Don't forget, 2005 was a record breaker for hurricans hitting the US.",
