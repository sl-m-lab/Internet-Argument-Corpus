At this stage the chance of survival is low and the risk of impairment and disability quite serious. \n Scientists say that this point of survivability will not change in the foreseeable future, because the fetal lung does not mature sufficiently to permit even mechanically-assisted breathing before week 23-24 of gestation.\n\n \n \n\n The eyelids are fused at the 18 week point and don't open until 28 weeks\n\n \n http://www.childdevelopmentinfo.com/development/prenataldevelopment.shtml\n \n \nSixth Month\n Eyelids which have been fused shut since third month, reopen\n\n \n http://www.cbctrust.com/PRENATAL.html\n \n At the 20 week mark:\n \nThe eyelids are completely fused\n\n \n \n\n There is little evidence that a fetus can \"feel\" pain.\n\n \n http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/anand/\n \n This one isn't too useful, since the fellow splits hairs since he says \"nociceptive activity, rather than pain,should be discussed with regard to the neonate\". He states, however, that whether or not the fetus experiences pain is a philosophical question.\n \n http://www.prochoiceactionnetwork-canada.org/fetal-pain.html\n \n \nIn fetal development, most major organs exist in rudimentary form by about 8 to 9 weeks. It takes several months for these organs to grow in size, complexity, and organization to the point they can function. For example, the myelin sheath-the insulating cover on nerve pathways that is required for efficient conduction of pain signals-does not begin forming around nervous system cells (neurons) in the spinal cord until about 24 weeks, and not till after birth in most of the cerebral cortex.[6],[7],[8] Although sporadic brain waves can be detected by about 21 weeks gestation, genuine continuous brain waves do not begin until about 28 weeks,[9] indicating that the nerve circuits needed to carry pain impulses to the brain are not fully connected till then. This also marks the beginnings of conscious awareness, which is generally considered a requirement for experiencing pain.\n\n and\n \nHere's a brief description of how pain impulses are transmitted through the body and brain. Nerve endings in the skin are the most common point of entry for a pain stimulus. From there, the pain impulse connects-or \"synapses\"-through the spinal cord, up to the brain stem at the base of the skull, and into the thalamus. The thalamus acts as a switchboard-it receives input signals from the body and transmits them to various parts of the brain. Pain signals from the thalamus go to the cerebral cortex-the thinking and feeling part of the brain. A highly-developed cortex is required to perceive pain signals. Activity at the nerve endings, spinal cord, or thalamus is not enough. At 13 weeks gestation, the brain stem and thalamus are not functional, anyway. The connections between the thalamus and the cortex do not even begin to form until about 20 to 26 weeks, and are not fully responsive till after birth.[10]\n\n \n http://www.cbctrust.com/PRENATAL.html\n \n From the 24 week mark:\n \nThis is the beginning of the third trimester of pregnancy. \n The interconnection or \"wiring up\" of the fetal brain has begun. The nerve cells of the neocortex begin to synapse with nerve cells from the thalamus, which is the relay point for the body's sensory input. Bursts of recognizable brain waves start to appear among the random signals.\n\n \n http://www.pediatrics.emory.edu/NEONATOLOGY/DPC/brain.htm\n \n \nMyelination begins at 6 months of gestation and continues into adulthood. This is the sixth and final stage of CNS development. The glial cells (those support cells that are part of the \"conveyor belt\") produce myelin. Myelin is a fatty covering that eventually coats and insulates many axons to provide for rapid impulse transmission. The cerebrum has both an outer layer (the \"cerebral cortex\") and an inner layer (the \"cerebral medulla\"). The cerebral medulla contains many bundles of myelinated axons which give it a white appearance (hence the name \"white matter\"). The myelinated axons fire more rapidly and efficiently than non-myelinated fibers. True maturity of the CNS only occurs after the Myelination process has fully developed.\n\n \n \n\n Regular wakefulness and sleep patterns, as well as continuous brain waves appear around 28 weeks, which is an indication of conciousness. Conciousness would be a requirement to experience pain. Since 24 weeks is the start of the 3rd trimester, and 80-90% of abortions occur before this point (I've hear 96% as well), pain really isn't a problem for abortions.\n\n \n http://www.cbctrust.com/PRENATAL.html\n \n \n\n At 12 Weeks' Gestation (from Conception): \n The second trimester of pregnancy has begun. \n External genital organs begin to differentiate. \n The fetus weighs about one ounce. \n More kinds of reflex movements appear. The brain is not yet well enough organized to control movements or form even the most basic perceptions. It will not be for some time. \n Most miscarriages and about 96% of abortions have taken place by this point\n\n \n http://www.uottawa.ca/health/information/contraception-abortion.html\n \n \nMost abortions are performed during the first 12 weeks (or 1st trimester,) but about 8% take place in the 2nd trimester - usually because the pregnancy was misdiagnosed, abortion services were not available, or the pregnancy has become unhealthy. Early abortions are safer, easier, and cheaper, but not always an option.\n\n \n \n\n The fetus has never achieved conciousness, let alone has known anything.\n\n \n Well, you get the idea.",

   "Obviously the question every debate on abortion boils down to is when does one get the right to live, so I'd like to use this thread as a debate on that subject. Since I'm mainly concerned with whether abortion is legal or not, I'd appreciate it if religion was kept out of the debate. So the questions are:\n \n a) What creatures have the right to live?\n b) When do these creatures get the right to live?\n c) Why do these creatures have the right to live at the time you give for question b.\n \n \n Please answer all questions rather than just one since all three are essential to the debate.\n\n a. no creatures have an innate right to life\n b. they don't\n c. they don't have the right to life\n \n Rights are given by government/culture.\n As to what rights I think creatures have under my government/culture:\n \n a. Citizens (human) under our law, who have not been sentenced to death, and possibly many other humans under international law (depending on the policies/laws in place), it's a long, convoluted list I'm sure. War is an example of policy desicion that removes human rights to life, both combatants and innocents, children, etc. In some cases you have rights before you are a citizen (see b). Ultimately it depends on what laws we recognize as valid. For example, Iraqi children might have the right to life under Iraqi law, however, we can enforce our law of NO rights, so it seems to be both observance and enforcement of laws that grants or removes rights.\n \n I don't think other animals have a \"right\" to life, but it is illegal in many cases to take their life (property, endagered, out of season, if done cruely, etc.).\n \n b. That's up to the courts to decide right now, in some cases. Someone else might have a better grasp of current abortion laws in the US which seem to decide when a fetus is a human with rights. A few months before birth is a guess.?\n \n c. Because we live in a democracy, our laws make it so. But in general, it's only a right given by humans to other humans/creatures, and again, only what's enforceable. Nature grants no pardon from death, and thus, is currently the ultimate giver of human rights (that's a stretch, but you know what I mean). At some point we might have a better handle on nature (fortune, without guided intervention from humans, etc.), and can grant even more expansive right to life.\n \n Grizzly world we live in, I'm rather partial to the order of law, and the strides in compassion that many industrialized nations have made. I hope it continues to improve.\n \n -Mach",

IMO, it seems to be accepted that it is right/moral/just to deprive individuals of their right to life if by doing so, more lives are saved. I would have never thought that killing Hitler was anything but just and moral.\n \n As for our topic, since the abortion of the fetus does not save anyone else's life, that fetus should be afforded the rights of the society it will eventually join (years later, as an adult).\n \n The point made earlier that \"rights\" are not 'natural,' but created by societies is a good one.

The umbilical cord attaches the uterine wall and allows a flow of nutrients directly into the fetus. I have seen it described as an organ belonging to the woman, but it seems more intimately connected to the fetus.

They caught on when her eyes rolled back. And second, back in the day (I'm talking anything over 100 years ago back in the day) abortion was very common. What did you expect. That was also pre-birth control. This moral uprising only began when it came out of the closet. The women kept it their little secret 'til then. How do I know? My mother, who would be 87 today, told me about it.",

It is quite sad to see how many 10-14 yr olds killed themselves though.",

   "Obviously the question every debate on abortion boils down to is when does one get the right to live, so I'd like to use this thread as a debate on that subject. Since I'm mainly concerned with whether abortion is legal or not, I'd appreciate it if religion was kept out of the debate. So the questions are:\n \n a) What creatures have the right to live?\n b) When do these creatures get the right to live?\n c) Why do these creatures have the right to live at the time you give for question b.\n \n \n Please answer all questions rather than just one since all three are essential to the debate.\n\n \n I believe this to be a cross between a religious issue and a social issue. you cannot discuss the issue without discussing the religious, as well as social sides of it. so I won't try. I'll talk about them all. And then I'll tell you why I support a woman's choice concerning her own body.\n \n One at a time...\n \n \n question a) what creatures have the right to live?\n scientific answer: none. there is no \"right\" to life. Life advances and evolves according to natural selection, and the law that the strong survive and the weak are eaten, or else-wise deleted through some manifestation of their weakness.\n social answer: not applicable. humans are the only \"creatures\" who can belong to society, and therefore, obviously, only humans have the \"right\" to life.\n religious answer: any creature with a soul has the \"right\" to live.\n \n conclusion: the issue as it relates to this question is inherently a religious issue, because scientifically the question is null, and socially it has no meaning.\n \n question b) when do these creatures get the right to live?\n scientific answer: never. same reason as above.\n social answer: any creature who \"becomes\" human acquires the right to live.\n religious answer: any creature who acquires a soul acquires the right to live.\n \n conclusion: this time the issue is not only religious; there is a combination of societal issues and religious issues which contribute to answering this question. no conclusion can really be made, yet, though the social answer leads to the obvious question: can a creature \"become\" human? does a maturing fetus in the womb \"become\" human at some point? or is it human from the moment of inception? i argue for the former, though plenty of people will disagree.\n \n \n question c) why do these creatures have the right to live at the time I give for question c:\n see my answers above. they are detailed.\n \n \n \n there is a very, very, very very VERY major question which you completely glossed over, and which is very very VERY pertinent to the issue. i raised this question to a short extent in the conclusion for question b.\n \n i'll call it \"question d)\"\n \n question d: at what point does a creature become human?\n \n obviously, this question is debatable. my personal opinion is that a creature (a fetus) becomes human at such time as it could live with minimal medical assistance outside of the mother's womb. this contributes to my further opinion that the larger issue is predominantly a religious one, because with the answer to this question i remove the only reason which would oppose me to abortion prior to the time of capability of self-sustainment.\n \n on the other hand, there are others who are not religious, who are against abortion. always, these are the people who answer this last question differently than me. always, these are the people who believe that from the time of conception, a fetus is in fact a human being.\n \n i cannot argue with their reasoning; it makes every bit as much sense as mine. from a purely physical standpoint, it makes even more sense. yet i stand by my point of view.\n \n i submit, though, that if you want to exclude religion from the discussion, this is the only truly debatable point about abortion whatsoever.\n \n anything else is religion. and that's a whole other can of worms.",

Do you answer the violence of rape with the violence of abortion?\n\n \n Maximus, I understand whereyour heart is on this, and it's not an eveil place. But when it comes to rape, I doubt you have a clue.\n \n The most important person in any rape is the victim. Her rights supercede all others.\n \n Feel free to offer support in helping a pregnant rape victim go through with a pregnancy. That is fine.\n \n But to demand it is another matter. To force a raped woman to remain pregnant against her will, is a nine month rape. She has already had her rights to maintain control of her body violently denied her. It is highly inaproapriate to continue to deny her the right to have control of her body. If she cen't go through with that pregnancy, so be it.

   "First of all, I believe that when conception occurs, there is a quite discontinuous event: the solidifying of the DNA that will be carried by whoever the fertilized egg becomes. It is the most discontinuous event in all of human existance, from life to death (well, arguably death). (A baby is born... but if the baby was removed by C-section, then the baby could've been \"born\" earlier...) \n \n There is never an exact time when it is determined whether or not a fetus is able to survive out of the womb. There is not an exact time when a fetus achieves consciousness... There is not an exactly determined time when a baby (after being born) is able to think above a certain intelligence level. There is not an exact time when it is determined that a person is acheiving more good for society than harm. There is not an EXACT time set after the heart stops beating that a person is not able to survive.\n \n Birth is not that discontinuous. If a baby is removed from the umbilical cord and placed on life-support machines, then it is simply changing from one form of life-support to another. As is witnessed by the debate in this thread, the idea of \"seperate entities\" of the mother and the fetus is a philosophical one that is debated. \n \n Conception is the most discontinuous event (maybe besides death) in the life of a human. The genetics of an individual never changes from conception onward. This is not a philosophical concept, but rather a scientific one that is quite solidly given an exact time (right after sperm penetrates egg).\n \n It is not possible to determine the future DNA of a future conception even looking a second before conception. The molecular scale of the sperm is such that if you tried to observe the exact location and position of the sperm (and the rest of the sperm that are close by), then you would alter the location and position of the sperm, so you could never get enough data to make a model of all the sperm to see which one would make it to the egg first. If one sperm is just a few twirls of the flagellum ahead of other sperm, one could argue, then it will lose the race to the other sperm. The flagellum is an example of a \"Brownian motor\" which acts randomly, much like the proteins in our muscles which contract (read more about Brownian motion and flagella). Since Brownian motors are inherently an atomic-scale phenomenon, if one atom is observed (no matter how good your equipment), then its state is irrevocably altered, and therefore the movement of the sperm is directly affected. This is based on the \"Heisenberg uncertainty principle.\" This is probably not that important of a point, but a valid one. This paragraph is for those of you who are pro-choice who say, \"Well, why stop at conception? Why not say that refusing sex is murder?\"\n \n After conception, however, a unique set of human DNA (which is shared in the case of twins and clones) is permanently determined. After this point, it is possible to tell a lot of things about the likely attributes of the adult when the human matures to adulthood.",
