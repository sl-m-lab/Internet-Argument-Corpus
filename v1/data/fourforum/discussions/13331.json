   "I'm currently sitting here at my desk staying up and trying not to worry over the next upcoming weeks but find my stomach churning as I think about my partner who is now entering into the military today. As a matter of fact I will be calling him in two hours to wake him so he can get ready to go to MEPS and then fly out to Great Lakes to begin Basic Training.\n \n Being a veteran, and knowing what boot camp entails I already know that the first couple of weeks will be difficult for him but that he will rise above it and perform well. I am so proud of him and love him dearly and that is the main reason why I am worried above all else.\n \n I experienced the shocking realization of how failed a policy DADT is personally. Being physically assaulted to the point of being critically injured is a light way to put it to say the least. To those of you know don't know I was assaulted by four other sailors on my ship of December 31, 2007. I suffered a fractured skull, massive blood loss, bruising, cuts, scrapes, and a major concussion as well as emotional trauma.\n \n \n I spent a week in the Infirmary on the Naval base and was transferred to a shore command where I was honorably discharged due to medical conditions 8 months later. The truth is, that I had no choice to stay in. After the true reason behind my attack came to light, my superiors gave me a choice. Either if I breathed a word about the incident, I would be discharged under DADT and have a other than honorable discharge, or I could shut my mouth, save face for the command and get out with benefits. I chose the latter.\n \n Sadly over 12,500 servicemen and women have been discharged under this policy. It to me is a bitter reliving of the horrors I experienced and a great fear for my partners safety and well being as he goes into the service today. As of now, I have been diagnosed with PTSD through the VA and an evaluation done by several doctors through them. \n \n Sometimes I wake up in cold sweats, other times I hyperventilate and become claustrophobic and even worse, sometimes I awake feeling I'm being attacked. Partially why I am up so late is because now I do not sleep well anymore and hardly get a decent nights rest.\n \n I am not sharing this to garner any sympathy or pity or remorse. But to shed light on the harsh reality of how homophobic the military is, let alone those in charge of it. Somehow I feel lucky. I survived. Some who were gay and attacked did not. Like Seaman August Provost who was murdered in Camp Pendleton. He had aspiring dreams and hopes. He attended college for three years and joined the Navy to fund the rest of his education. He was shot to death in a guard shack and then the attacker set the shack on fire and burned his body to cinders. \n \n And still the Navy does to classify it as a hate crime because they refuse to acknowledge the existence of gay members in uniform. Even now I am feeling such hurt from this policy Tonight my partner could not even say he loved me or even anything intimate because he was afraid the person he was staying with in the hotel room would overhear or worse. Even now he has to live a double closeted life. Hiding that we are together or that he is gay, or that he even has anyone close to him that cares for him.\n \n He's even skeptical about me writing letters to him encouraging him during his time in basic. It tears my heart in two feeling the harshness of this policy still in effect and how even now, affects me daily in my relationship with my partner.\n \n I marched in West Hollywood and protested at a DNC fundraiser where Obama attended. There I bet Dan Choi an openly gay Army officer who had done tours in Iraq and was an Arabic language specialist. Discharged because he was gay. We have lost so many bright irreplaceable people due to this.\n \n The service is hurting right now for those who are qualified for specific roles in the military. My partner is going in as a hospital corpsman and will be training to become a radiologist. I hurt now, because I know Obama could end it. He could end DADT and yet his promises has not been kept to the gay community. I sit here almost in tears and frustration because with a stroke of a pen, my fears could be quelled. \n \n I don;t know what the future will bring. He wants to be stationed in San Deigo and live together which would be so wonderful if it happened. But I don't know how him or I could cope with living our double lives for so long, and myself refuse to go back in the closet for anything. \n \n I urge everyone here for the sake of one whom I love, and those now serving to defend and die for your freedom to send a message to repeal DADT. It hurts those who are affected so deep. It is hurting me. And it hurts who we are as a country.\n \n I leave you with this. A gay man or women in uniform who's blood is spilled. Runs just as red and flows just as much as any strait person wearing the same uniform. We have payed the ultimate price in defense of our nation. Is it not time someone defended us?",

   "From washingtonpost.com:\n\n I Didn't Tell. It Didn't Matter.\n Trying to serve his country, a young man faced bigotry and abuse\n By Joseph Rocha\n Sunday, October 11, 2009\n \n I was 18 years old when I landed in the kingdom of Bahrain, off the coast of Saudi Arabia, in the winter of 2005. It was the first time I'd ever left the continental United States. My joints ached after more than 24 hours of travel, but I knew that a new life of service and adventure awaited me on the other side of that aircraft door.\n \n This was the day I had been dreaming about since I'd enlisted in the Navy a few months before, on my birthday. I loved my country, and I knew that I was ready to prove myself in action.\n \n I also knew that I was gay.\n \n However, I chose to put service above my personal life. My understanding of the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy was that if I kept quiet about my sexuality and didn't break any rules, I would face no punishment. I was wrong.\n \n Once I joined the Navy, I was tormented by my chief and fellow sailors, physically and emotionally, for being gay. The irony of \"don't ask, don't tell\" is that it protects bigots and punishes gays who comply. Now, after a Youth Radio investigation of the abuses I suffered, the chief of naval operations ordered a thorough study of how the Navy handled the situation and is currently reviewing the document. I'm hopeful that the case will be reopened and top leadership finally held accountable for the lives they have ruined.\n \n Within days of arriving at my duty station in Bahrain, I decided that I wanted to earn a place among the elite handlers working with dogs trained to detect explosives. After passing exams and completing training, I went from serving among hundreds of military police to serving in a specialized unit of two dozen handlers and 32 dogs. I was responsible for training and working with two dogs throughout the region. Our goal was to keep explosives and insurgents out of Iraq and Afghanistan.\n \n For 12 hours a day in 112-degree heat with 85 percent humidity, we searched vehicles for explosives and responded to any threats. I loved the job, but there wasn't a day that went by when I wasn't completely miserable.\n \n Shop talk in the unit revolved around sex, either the prostitute-filled parties of days past or the escapades my comrades looked forward to. They interpreted my silence and total lack of interest as an admission of homosexuality. My higher-ups seemed to think that gave them the right to bind me to chairs, ridicule me, hose me down and lock me in a feces-filled dog kennel.\n \n I can't say for certain when the abuse started or when it stopped. Now, several years removed from those days in Bahrain, it blends together in my mind as a 28-month nightmare.\n \n Once, the abuse was an all-day event; a training scenario turned into an excuse to humiliate me. Normally we ran the dogs through practice situations -- an earthquake, a bomb or a fight -- that we might encounter in our work. That day, in a classroom at an American school in Bahrain, with posters of the Founding Fathers lining the walls, the scenario happened to be me. I was the decoy, and I had to do just what Chief Petty Officer Michael Toussaint ordered.\n \n In one corner of the classroom was a long sofa, turned away from the door. When you walked into the room, it appeared that one man was sitting on it, alone. But I was there too -- the chief had decided that I would be down on my hands and knees, simulating oral sex. A kennel support staff member and I were supposed to pretend that we were in our bedroom and that the dogs were catching us having sex. Over and over, with each of the 32 dogs, I was forced to enact this scenario.\n \n I told no one about what I was living through. I feared that reporting the abuse would lead to an investigation into my sexuality. My leaders and fellow sailors were punishing me for keeping my sexuality to myself, punishing me because I wouldn't \"tell.\"\n \n I even saw \"don't ask, don't tell\" used against heterosexual female service members who had reported being the victims of sexual assault. If my chief acted on their statements, he would be forced to punish a friend of his, so the easiest way to make the problem go away was to scare the women into silence by saying something like: \"You weren't sexually assaulted by a male in my unit. I hear you're a lesbian.\" After all, homosexuals have no rights in our military. You can't sexually assault someone who doesn't exist.\n \n But the abuse wasn't invisible to everyone. In 2005, roughly six months into my time with that unit, a new sailor in our group was taken aback when I was left tied up in a dog kennel. She reported the incident and, from what I understand, this prompted an internal investigation into hazing in my unit. Even then, the abuse continued, and I still couldn't bring myself to talk about it. It took 90 minutes and the threat of a subpoena to get me to testify.\n \n The Navy confirmed 93 incidents of misconduct, including hazing, abuse, physical assault, solicitation of prostitutes and misuse of government property and funds, but the case was closed. After receiving a letter of caution, the military's version of a slap on the wrist, my chief was eventually promoted in rank and position.\n \n In the course of that investigation, the Navy decided to charge my best friend, Petty Officer 1st Class Jennifer Valdivia, a 27-year-old Sailor of the Year and second in command of my unit, for failing to put an end to my chief's tyranny. The idea that she could have stopped the abuse is, to me, unfair and unreasonable. The Navy itself failed to stop him.\n \n Val, as I called her, was set to return home when she was told of the charges and that she wouldn't be leaving Bahrain as planned. She was afraid that she would never see the United States again. My mentor ended up taking her life.\n \n This incredible woman, whom I ate lunch with every Sunday and ran with every morning, was gone. Since the night I learned of her death, I have been haunted by nightmares. In my dreams, she's decomposing and suggests that the only way for me to stop my abuse is to follow her lead and end my life.\n \n Just two days before she killed herself, Val gave me a gift, a token of congratulations on being accepted to the Naval Academy prep school in Rhode Island.\n \n And despite everything that had happened -- the abuse and her death -- I decided to enroll. I wanted to put what had happened in Bahrain behind me. I had applied to the academy twice before I was finally accepted to the prep school, an education that would put me on my way to a commission from Annapolis.\n \n It was my dream come true. I left Bahrain as a petty officer 3rd class and completed a six-week officer candidate boot camp. My commanders told me they wanted me to have a leadership role at the school. But after more than two years of abuse, the suicide of a fine sailor and the Navy's unwillingness to punish the top leadership in my unit, I was mentally and emotionally depleted. I refused to be punished any longer for who I am, so I made the most difficult decision of my life. I stood outside the office of my commanding officer with my knees buckling. My resignation read:\n \n \"I am a homosexual. I deeply regret that my personal feelings are not compatible with Naval regulations or policy. I am proud of my service and had hoped I would be able to serve the Navy and the country for my entire career. However, the principles of honor, courage and commitment mean I must be honest with myself, courageous in my beliefs, and committed in my action. I understand that this statement will be used to end my Naval career.\"\n \n It would take two months for the Naval Academy and its lawyers to figure out what to do with me. The lawyers dove into a mess of technicalities. The \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy is riddled with inconsistencies, loopholes, unfairness and hypocrisy. As an officer candidate, I found the situation even more confusing. Lawyers debated: Should they be consulting the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy for officers or the regulations for enlisted personnel? Given the amount of money invested in military officers, the policy for them is far more forgiving.\n \n During those weeks I was ordered to restricted duty and living quarters. I was stuck pulling weeds in the courtyard of the school, as students who had been my peers walked to class in their proud midshipmen-candidate uniforms. I was ordered not to contact my former classmates by any means. The school didn't want me to \"influence them.\" This was my lowest point. Based on principle, based on dignity, I had forfeited my dream of a Naval Academy graduation.\n \n Thankfully, I was discharged honorably with full benefits. Otherwise, I would have been left with no money for college and no health-care options for the severe depression, insomnia and post-traumatic stress disorder that Veterans Affairs physicians have diagnosed in me since I've returned from overseas. That would have been lawful under \"don't ask, don't tell.\"\n \n For years, I kept this story a secret from my loved ones, wanting simply to move on. But I believe we have a window of opportunity now in the effort to repeal \"don't ask, don't tell,\" and this has propelled me to go public with my experience. This weekend, I will be at the National Equality March for gay rights in Washington, after traveling across the country speaking at gay pride events and at universities, trying to build momentum for a strategy for repeal.\n \n I'm doing all of this during midterms at the University of San Diego, where I am a junior majoring in political science. While my greatest regret is that I will never graduate from Annapolis, I am confident that soon I will serve proudly as a commissioned officer.\n \n I don't think I will ever feel as powerless as I did when I was on my knees, wearing a U.S. military uniform in the Middle East, forced by my superior to shove my head between another man's legs. But I have discovered that telling this story holds its own kind of power.\n \n The more I talk about what happened to me, the more I hear from others who have been in similar situations. Students in the service academies calling me, crying, asking if they should quit. World War II veterans. Enlisted soldiers serving overseas. They are hopeful that we may soon have a different kind of military, that gay and lesbian men and women can serve the country we love with job security and dignity.\n \n Despite everything, I am hopeful, too.\n \n Joseph Rocha is a junior at the University of San Diego.\n \n",

The C.O. put his foot down hard before the guy got to our sub saying that harassment would not be tolerated for whatever reason.\n But there are other commands where such things are not routine.

They cover a small fraction of that.\n \n Does the fact that you hadn't heard of him have some significance?\n \n \n \nFurthermore, how does it follow that this is the fault of DADT, rather than some very homophobic commanding officers? If they HAD followed DADT correctly, this wouldn't have taken place.\n\n You don't seem to get DADT HAS NOT ENFORCEMENT.\n The only \"law\" that's on the books is a law that states gays can't serve in the military. That's it.\n \n Clinton gave some loose guidance on how to treat the \"gay\" situation.\n But while there have been thousands of gays kicked out after DADT, can you point to ANY punishment for a person who simply violated DADT?\n Any real punishment for people who harass?\n \n The gay exclusion law needs to go.",

   "\n The only \"law\" that's on the books is a law that states gays can't serve in the military. That's it.\n\n \n Incorrect. Clinton SIGNED DADT.\n \n From our good friend Wikipedia ...\n \n Don't ask, don't tell is the common term for the policy regarding gays and lesbians serving openly in the U.S. military mandated by federal law Pub.L. 103-160 (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 654). Unless one of the exceptions from 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(b) applies, the policy prohibits anyone who \"demonstrate(s) a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts\" from serving in the armed forces of the United States, because \"it would create an unacceptable risk to the high standards of morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion that are the essence of military capability.\" The act prohibits any homosexual or bisexual person from disclosing his or her sexual orientation or from speaking about any homosexual relationships, including marriages or other familial attributes, while serving in the United States armed forces. The \"don't ask\" part of the policy indicates that superiors should not initiate investigation of a service member's orientation in the absence of disallowed behaviors, though mere suspicion of homosexual behavior can cause an investigation.\n \n The policy was introduced as a compromise measure in 1993 and approved by then President Bill Clinton who, while campaigning for the Presidency, had promised to allow all citizens regardless of sexual orientation to serve openly in the military, a departure from the then complete ban on those who are not heterosexual. \n Here is the wording from actual LAW that gives the conditions for which a service member may be terminated for those type of actions ...\n (2) That the member has stated that he or she is a homosexual\n or bisexual, or words to that effect, unless there is a further\n finding, made and approved in accordance with procedures set\n forth in the regulations, that the member has demonstrated that\n the or she is not a person who engages in, attempts to engage in,\n has a propensity to engage in, or intends to engage in homosexual acts. \n (3) That the member has married or attempted to marry a person known to be of the same biological sex.\n \n So in essence, the issue is not whether a person is gay, but whether a person is OUT. And it IS clear in law that the issue is STATING or DEMOMSTRATING being gay.\n \n \n \nThe gay exclusion law needs to go.\n\n \n I have no problem with that. I think people having homosexual relationships (or any kind of socially unacceptable or acceptable relationship) should be allowed to serve. I'm not for DADT or any restrictions in this regard. \n \n But don't pretend DADT goes no further than saying gays can't serve. It IS policy.",

Cause if they do they are going to get busted and legal proceedings will commence.\n \n There is nothing special to the \"don't tell\" part of this whole situation.\n That much was obvious.\n \n We had a \"don't tell\" in effect BEFORE Clinton came into office.\n It was called \"common sense\"!\n \n From your Wikipedia Article: \"The introduction of \"Don't ask, don't tell\" with the later amendment of \"don't pursue, don't harass\" has officially prohibited such behavior, but reports suggest that such harassment continues.[10]\"\n Don't ask, don't tell - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n As I mentioned earlier, I haven't seen any story EVER demonstrating an actual punishment for a harassment.\n The fact that gays should be kicked out of the military if discovered is iron clad in the law.\n Limits on the military and their conduct towards gays is a gray area at best. emoticon_mad\n \n \n \nThe \"don't ask\" part of the policy indicates that superiors should not initiate investigation of a service member's orientation in the absence of disallowed behaviors, though mere suspicion of homosexual behavior can cause an investigation.\n\n First of all, the above are YOUR words, correct?\n \n If you think about it, what you just described is completely horse hockey regarding an effective policy.\n Most people in society have a 5th amendment right to not incriminate themselves.\n Clinton GAVE gays a 5th amendment right to not incriminate themselves but ONLY workable on the ENTRANCE documentation.\n That is nothing spectacular.\n \n The military has laws against adultery as well. You don't see the military asking questions about whether or not applicants are guilty of adultery, or if they are inclined to sleep with their ship-mates wives.\n \n Furthermore, the \"mere suspicion of homosexual behavior can cause an investigation\" should ring a warning bell to you.\n The FULL TITLE of this policy was SUPPOSED to be \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell, Don't Pursue, Don't Harass\".\n \"The introduction of \"Don't ask, don't tell\" with the later amendment of \"don't pursue, don't harass\" has officially prohibited such behavior, but reports suggest that such harassment continues.[10]\"Don't ask, don't tell - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n \n \nThe policy was introduced as a compromise measure in 1993 and approved by then President Bill Clinton who, while campaigning for the Presidency, had promised to allow all citizens regardless of sexual orientation to serve openly in the military, a departure from the then complete ban on those who are not heterosexual.\n\n As I mentioned earlier, it wasn't a compromise.\n Clinton, with a Republican congress, was faced with a veto-proof majority.\n The \"Gays can't serve in the military\" is hard-coded into congressional legislation.\n \n But where do you see any congress passed legislation saying that a commander can't ask if somebody is gay???\n YOU YOURSELF stated that \"though mere suspicion of homosexual behavior can cause an investigation\".\n \n HOW does that follow any sort of \"Don't Ask\" mentality???\n \n \n \nHere is the wording from actual LAW that gives the conditions for which a service member may be terminated for those type of actions ...\n (2) That the member has stated that he or she is a homosexual\n or bisexual, or words to that effect, unless there is a further\n finding, made and approved in accordance with procedures set\n forth in the regulations, that the member has demonstrated that\n the or she is not a person who engages in, attempts to engage in,\n has a propensity to engage in, or intends to engage in homosexual acts. \n (3) That the member has married or attempted to marry a person known to be of the same biological sex.\n\n As usual, you're not seeing the whole picture.\n There are words ABOVE what you quoted which make it clear...(b) Policy.-A member of the armed forces shall be separated from the armed forces under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense if one or more of the following findings is made and approved in accordance with procedures set forth in such regulations:\n \n (1) That the member has engaged in, attempted to engage in, or solicited another to engage in a homosexual act or acts unless there are further findings, made and approved in accordance with procedures set forth in such regulations, that the member has demonstrated that- So you see, a person can REFUSE to say they are not gay, but IF SOMEBODY OUTS the gay person that is enough for the military.\n \n Not outing yourself is not protection from getting kicked out of the military.\n \n \n \nSo in essence, the issue is not whether a person is gay, but whether a person is OUT. And it IS clear in law that the issue is STATING or DEMOMSTRATING being gay.\n\n Jyoshu, Being \"out\" will get you kicked out.\n But it is NOT THE ONLY thing that will get you kicked out.\n BEING outed (against your will) will ALSO get you kicked out, as I proved above.\n \n \n \nI have no problem with that. I think people having homosexual relationships (or any kind of socially unacceptable or acceptable relationship) should be allowed to serve. I'm not for DADT or any restrictions in this regard. \n But don't pretend DADT goes no further than saying gays can't serve. It IS policy.\n\n Jyoshu, LOOK at what you quoted!!!\n The ONLY mention of any sort of \"Don't Ask\" is that the entrance documents have \"Are you gay\" stricken from the records.\n THAT IS IT.\n \n The document clearly states that if there is a SUSPICION that the person is gay, that justifies an INVESTIGATION.\n There is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING in the above that prevents any superior from demanding a subordinate state whether or not they are gay.\n In fact, it ALLOWS an investigation based on nothing more than a \"suspicion\".\n \n What I said was accurate.",
