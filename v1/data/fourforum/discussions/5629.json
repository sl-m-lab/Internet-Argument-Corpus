   "So you're saying that abortion in America is a state-sponsored attempt to wipe out undesirable groups such as Jews, Gypsies, Poles, Slavs, homosexuals, dissidents, and the handicapped? And during this state-sponsored genocide, women are tortured and forced to abort their babes against their wills. And that those abortions are made as painful as possible for reasons of scientific curiosity and perhaps even sadism?\n\n \n I did a search on myself and found no where in all my posts where I said the above quote or even parts of it. However, I will say now that abortion in America is awful similiar to what the nazis did. They both classified people, the both used cruel ways to kill someone (although i'm not sure there is a non-cruel way), and yeah, wiping out undersirable groups would be a fair term.

I would also say abortions are painful for the fetus(mostly with later term abortions), however, the reasons why to make it painful I don't know. \n \n \n \nOnly because I can best you in an argument, do you call it tripe.

Yet, you bitch about lives to be saved, as someone drops on the street, going into full cardiac arrest.\n This is just funny...Thinking in an absolute like this shows your unwillingness to listen and lack of arguement.

   "well, I believe murder is wrong whether a law exists or not. The law is not the determination of whats right and wrong.\n\n \n So what do you believe \"murder\" to be then?\n \n You see for me murder, or 1st degree homicide if you prefer, is a term that describes the unlawful premediated killing of a person (a definition I can back up) by another. There are clear instances where it is applicable, and clear instances where it is not (manslaughter, death by dangerous driving and so on). Don't forget that in this context a person is also a legal entity with defined meaning.\n \n For you murder is a term that you apply to ending of a life/existance in a context that offends you- there is no actual \"meaning\" to justify your use of the word. By your example, we could postulate that any killing can be described as murder because you have no context to frame your use of the term. You might counter and say lawful killing is not murder (ie. Soldier killing an enemy in time of war), but anyone can rubbish that position by asserting that by their feelings they think that instance is murder just because they personally believe it is wrong.\n \n So you basically use the term based on your passions and not any reason- see the arbitary and potentailly shifting nature of such an approach, especially when applied to a group of people at large?\n \n You seem to think you talk in such bold absolutes when you talk of abortion as being murder, but I see the opposite.

Likewise a mother has no right to survive at the unwilling expense of her child. The difference is that a mother can typically survive without a fetus, whereas a fetus typically cannot survive without its mother. The infant's death is only permissable where we cannot preserve it without violating anyone else's right to personal autonomy. \n \n Now, if we were capable of somehow bringing babies to term outside of women's bodies, then we would be bound to preserve these babies' lives once they were extracted from the mother's body. \n \n Now the Nazis did not recognize anyone's right to personal autonomy, nor anyone's right to life, as the USA does.

   "So a political body just makes up rights....and you can have a right to personal autonomy with a right to life?\n No, in assuming a system of rights a political body automatically accepts the right to personal autonomy. \n \n I never said with life I said right to life. Without a right to life I could kill you and nothing would be wrong with that so good luck claiming a right to have me bury your body.\n By killing me you would be violating other rights besides any right to life that I have. In Canada you would be violating my right to 'security of person', for example, and unless you could prove that such a violation was merited, say by self-defense, then that violation would be unjustified and you would forfeit your own right to security of person. \n \nAs for who created the right...this does matter. Once again, if you assume the government makes rights then if abortion were illegal you would not feel a right has been violated as no right would then exist. Even if we were to use your government as the creator of rights, there is no right to personal autonomy is the US as far as I know...atleast not in the Consitution or state of VA laws.\n The gov't certainly creates laws to instantiate rights, but the rights themselves exist by virtue of participating in a body politic that admits rights. \n \n As for the right to personal autonomy in the US Constitution, it is instantiated here: \nAmendment IV\n \n The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. \n\n \nI guess thats opinion...however, slaughetering is slaughtering in my book. Both involve sick ways to kill people and thus both are equally wrong to me.\n No, it's a fact that the Holocaust is worse than the American permission of abortion, as I have pointed out. \n \n40 million babies killed because the mother didnt want them(mostly) or 6 million Jews beause the Nazis didnt want them. Where is the difference? However, I will agree that the motive is different. One is hate one is selfishness both are wrong.\n At least you agree that they are different in an important respect. \n \n How is killing someone that you don't know wants to be killed humane?\n It's humane because instead of letting them get on with a long and drawn out death from natural causes you alleviate their suffering by removing their capacity to suffer.\n \n I thought laws were what made rights though?\n No, laws and rights are quite independent of each other, although rights may be the subject of laws, and laws enacted in systems admitting to rights must conform to those rights. \n \nDoesn't seem like a good choice to me....\"you can be killed via burning chemicals or chopped up or gassed...take your pick\". I'm not seeing the humane part. Killing someone that did nothing wrong and had no desire to be killed is not right.\n In itself and for no compelling reason I quite agree that killing someone is not right, because it is worse than the alternative. However, where the alternative is worse than killing someone, say killing ten someones, it is morally obligatory to avoid the worst and choose the better alternative - which in the case of abortion is the next worse outcome. \n \n The humane-ness of abortion vis-a-vis Nazi tortures of infants, is the fact that the former is done to minimize the infants suffering and the latter was done in order to make the infant suffer.\n \nSo, yes, you put personal autonomy over a right to life. Very well then, if you had no right to life how would you ever have your \"right\"?\n Because the structure of any system of rights requires some right to personal autonomy whereas a right to life is incidental. If you want to know more about why this is so, please read my discussion with Chloe in this thread. \nMoreover, what about the personal autonomy of the \"fetus\"? Why is he/she not granted the same right? It is a person. So wouldn't this be placing one person over another? You can probably see where this leads... \n The fetus has the same right to personal autonomy as the mother, as I'm sure you read in my previous post. This right to personal autonomy is not violated by its removal from the mother, as it may not exercise that right at the expense of her right to the same, and removing it from the mother does not place it over the mother in its value as a human being. The infant has the same rights and value as any other human being, but is unfortunately in the wrong place at the wrong time. \n \nWhy? You just said it was ok to kill the baby because as some point it is still in the mother and she can choose to keep it and kill it right?\n In fact I didn't. I said that the mother had the right to remove it from her body. The baby's death in incidental to its removal from the mother and the preservation of her right to personal autonomy, and its premature death at the hands of the surgeon is a mercy considering the alternative of a slow lingering death at no-one's hands. Since we cannot preserve the child's life once it is removed from the mother, then it should be put down in the most humane way possible.",

   "Because the structure of any system of rights requires some right to personal autonomy whereas a right to life is incidental. If you want to know more about why this is so, please read my discussion with Chloe in this thread. \n\n \n Chloe was right in what he said...how can you have a right to personal autonomy without first existing? You can't even survive without a right to exist as someone could easily kill you rightfully even if a right to personal autonomy exists. You were still allowed to do whatever you wanted with your own body...but someone came along and shot you in the head. However, without personal autonomy a right to life can still exist. An EXTREME example would be a child. The child is forced to do as the mother/father says and is forced to go to school and forced to do many things with his/her own body however the child can't be killed illegally.",

That is having the right for someone ELSE to not search you. Nothing about you being able to do what you want to do to yourself.\n As I read the passage:\nAmendment IV\n \n The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\n So you wouldn't call being required to host an unwanted fetus as an unreasonable seizure of their person? Security of persons against unreasonable search and seizure seems to me to constitute the very essence of a right to personal autonomy - the gov't doesn't get to dispose of your body or possessions without your permission. It can't sell you into slavery, for example. \n \nYeah read it. IT makes no sense as a right to life is essential for any other right.\n You may want to re-read it because I explain how a right to life is incidental or derivative of more essential rights, and how it is necessarily trumped by these rights, including the right to personal autonomy.\n \n Here's the gist, so you know what to read for: \n A right to personal autonomy is necessary as a structural component of a system of rights, because it defines how ownership is resolved in a system of rights. The possession and exercise of these rights are incidental to the possession of life. Any right to life is therefore either derivative of these foundational rights, or participates in an incoherent system of rights. Either way, a right to life is trumped by a right to personal autonomy.\n \n Then don't respond...and I did read it by the way.\n I'm sorry, it's just that you don't seem to be responding as though you read and understood the material.",

   "a right to life is essential for any other right.\n\n \n Actually, a right to life makes all other rights meaningless and is in itself contradictory.\n \n If there is enough food for one, and two people have a \"right to life\", both people have a right to the food. But rights are about the allocation of scarce resources, and a system of rights which ignores this generates irreconcilable conflicts, it can be no basis for social interaction.\n \n For a more practical example, we could extend many peoples' lives by providing them with the very best medical treatment and doctors. But they cannot all be provided with such treatment. The right to life cannot be consistently maintained, and as such cannot be considered a \"right\", but a vague principle to be applied where the applicant fancies - the conservative applies it to babies, the socialist to the poor, the environmentalist to the quality of the environment, the pharmaceutical giants to the supply of drugs.\n \n \nThe US has no right to personal autonomy.\n\n \n Funnily enough, this is what is known as the right to life, as in \"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\".
