   "Since you wanted to dwell on this point and demonstrate your ignorance, I thought it would be a good idea to assist you. But your little asides that have nothing to do with the topic of the thread are not appropriate. If you wanted to debate grammar, then you should have started a thread to do so. Your insults and ignorance are not on topic in the thread where you chose to express them.\n \nIt is because it is in the title that it is a noun!\n\n I see. The \"on\" is a noun? Any word that is used in the title of a book becomes a noun? Darwin titled his book On The Origin Of Species. That means that \"on\", \"the\", and \"of\" are nouns merely because they were used in the title of a book. Gosh! You're so smart. I'm going to have to go back to my professors of linguistics and ask for a refund. They gave me a degree and you know more than they.\n \nIt is a proper noun. Only an 'idiot' would be so bold as to claim otherwise.\n\n That's moronic. The entire title may be a proper noun. That does not make every word in the title a noun in every case.\n \nAnd, Little Red Riding Hood was the name of the girl... Like Kevin Costner's character was called \"Dances with Wolves\" in the film of that name.\n\n Thoughtless. No matter how you want to cut it, \"red\" isn't a noun. If someone is named \"Rain in the face\", or \"Sitting bull\", or \"Crazy horse\", or \"White hand\", then the words \"in, the, sitting, crazy, and white\" are nouns. They aren't titles of books, they are the actual names of real people.\n \nWhat is a proper noun? \n A proper noun is used to name a specific person, place or thing . Such as Bill Gates, New York and the Hudson River. A proper noun is always capitalized.\" \n http://wi.essortment.com/partsofspeech_rigq.htm\n (such as a book title)\n \n \" Titles of books are proper nouns like Oliver Twist. This book was written by a particular person, Charles Dickens.\"\n\n Indeed true. Titles of books, the whole title as a unit and not the individual words, are proper nouns. Words in the titles of books are not converted to nouns because of their inclusion in a book title.\n \nIt is so basic a rule in English. Note the second one didn't say 'a part of the title'! Its saying the whole of the title!\n\n Yes. It did. And that means \"the whole of the title\". It does not mean each word of the title. It seems that you don't understand your own sources. The title as a whole is a proper noun. That does not mean that all words in the title are therfore nouns.\n \nYou're a funny bloke Lurch. Funny, and sad. But just keep on this point, you're loosing what little credibility you think you have.\n\n You are claiming that almost every word in the english language (of, the, this, you, a, on, in, is, are, godless, major, minor, undaunted, mistaken, extinct, brief, before, whole, blind, elegant, at, and so on) simply because it is used in the title of a book becomes a noun. Even more than that. You claim that they are proper nouns!\n \n Your ignorance knows no bounds.\n \n There is no noun, \"evolutionary.\" The word is an adjective. Because Futuyma titled his book, Evolutionary Biology does not make \"evolutionary\" an proper noun. The title may be, but the words aren't.\n \n \"Evolutionary\" is an adjective. It is always an adjective. Using it in an attempt to insult me with the pretense that evolution is my religion is stupid. My religion is not evolution and my pastor would be quite surprised at your assertion.\n \n If you are going to do nothing more than make yourself look like a fool, then don't PM me. At least have the integrity to learn what you are talking about.\n \n Let me make it clear. The use of an adjective in the title of a book does not make that adjective a noun. Only the illiterate would claim so. SUCKER!",

   "I don't know the circumstances of your argument with montalban, and to be quite frank: I don't think that they matter much. If he was wrong, then fine. It's better to admit it and move on. My primary problem is with you hurling out such insults like \"sucker\" and \"moronic\". What is more pitiful is to claim that \"He does it to me!\" A completely unacceptable statement; 'I did a because x also did it'. \n \n This would probably have been better settled in private. It is more of a private issue between the two of you, making it public is unnecessary.\n \n Don't get me wrong, 'it takes two to tango'. If there is one thing that should be ridden in debate, it is name calling. I know it is often hard to resist rising to the bait, (I have risen to it many times, only to regret it later) and stooping to the opponent's level, but let us remember the old debate truth: the person who is angrier is wrong. I can assure you, the man (or woman) who keeps his (or her) peace in debate walks away more satisfied, and has earned more respect by others. Anyone can get angry to a comment that they dislike; it takes skill to avoid it.\n \n Debate is not all about winning. In fact, debate would be sorrowful place if it was all about that, and the people who would debate would be rather ignorant. Debate is a challenge, yes, but there is a lot to be learnt in debate. One can increase their knowledge quite significantly by observing things from another point of view, and other opinions. If you ask me what I like better: the challenge or the learning, there wouldn't be a moments doubt.",
