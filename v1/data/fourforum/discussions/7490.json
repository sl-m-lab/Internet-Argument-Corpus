   "Not to disrespect Ms. King but I recall decades ago when the PR machine made JFK a demi-god and to this day it is unacceptable to speak of his many vices. We can nail Clinton to the wall for lying about a BJ but JFK gets a free pass for his many womanizing exploits.\n \n I respect the Kings. I have no reason not to. But the many speeches I have heard her husband give mainly consisted of simple rhetoric with no real substance, delivered in the typical southern pulpit manner. Although, he was the symbol for black soldarity and the guy they rallied behind. For that alone, he deserves respect.\n \n I think Ms. King did a lot. Right? I just do not recall what she did that was so earth moving. Could this possibly be the work of the well-oiled PR machine again? Perhaps I should do a Google search and learn more about her.\n \n I believe I read that her and Hillery have a lot in common.",
