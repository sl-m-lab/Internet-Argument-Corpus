How many cases of school shootings have actually occurred in America, 12? 20? maybe even 100 whackos who have attacked schools, which I think is a high number. And how many CCP holders are their in America? 20 million, 30 million? or even more? \n \n So first show the number, IN MILLIONS, of conceal carry permit holders in America, and then show how many actual school shootings have taken place in America, which is a number somewhere between 10 and 100 I would guess, and then tell us what percentage of gun crimes that represents in America that were committed by CARRY PERMIT holders. Let's see how scary a number that is statistically. It should be somewhere in the range of 1-100th of 1 percent of the number of CCP holders in America.\n \n And a more interesting stat would be, how many CCP holders played any role in any of those school shootings?

SHORT TITLE.\n \n This Act may be cited as the ''Second Amendment\n Enforcement Act''.\n \n SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n \n Congress finds the following:\n \n (1) The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. (2) As the Congress and the Supreme Court of the United States have recognized, the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the rights of individuals, including those who are not members of a militia or engaged in military service or training, to keep and bear arms.\n (3) The law-abiding citizens of the District of Columbia are deprived by local laws of handguns, ri1fles, and shotguns that are commonly kept by law abiding persons throughout the United States for sporting use and for lawful defense of their persons, homes, businesses, and families. (4) The District of Columbia has the highest per capita murder rate in the Nation, which may be attributed in part to local laws prohibiting possession of firearms by law-abiding persons who would otherwise be able to defend themselves and their loved ones in their own homes and businesses. (5) The Federal Gun Control Act of 1968, as amended by the Firearms Owners' Protection Act of 1986, and the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993, provide comprehensive Federal regulations applicable in the District of Columbia as elsewhere. In addition, existing District of Columbia criminal laws punish possession and illegal use of firearms by violent criminals and felons. Consequently, there is no need for local laws which only affect and disarm law-abiding citizens. (6) Officials of the District of Columbia have indicated their intention to continue to unduly restrict lawful firearm possession and use by citizens of the District. (7) Legislation is required to correct the District of Columbia's law in order to restore the fundamental rights of its citizens under the Second\n Amendment to the United States Constitution and thereby enhance public safety.\n \n SEC. 3. REFORM D.C. COUNCIL'S AUTHORITY TO RESTRICTFIREARMS.\n \n Section 4 of the Act entitled ''An Act to prohibit the killing of wild birds and wild animals in the District of Columbia'', approved June 30, 1906 (34 Stat. 809; sec.\n 1-303.43, D.C. Official Code) is amended by adding at the end the following: ''Nothing in this section or any other provision of law shall authorize, or shall be construed to permit, the Council, the Mayor, or any governmental or regulatory authority of the District of Columbia to prohibit, constructively prohibit, or unduly burden the ability of persons not prohibited from possessing firearms under Federal law from acquiring, possessing in their homes or businesses, or using for sporting, self-protection or other lawful purposes, any firearm neither prohibited by Federal law nor subject to the National Firearms Act. The District of Columbia shall not have authority to enact laws or regulations that discourage or eliminate the private ownership or use of firearms.''\n \n SEC. 4. REPEAL D.C. SEMIAUTOMATIC BAN.\n \n (a) IN GENERAL.-Section 101(10) of the Firearms Control Regulations Act of 1975 (sec. 7-2501.01(10), D.C. Official Code) is amended to read as follows: ''(10) 'Machine gun' means any firearm which shoots, is designed to shoot, or readily restored to shoot automatically, more than 1 shot without manual reloading by a single function of the trigger, and includes the frame or receiver of any such weapon, any part designed and intended solely and exclusively, or combination of parts designed and intended, for use in converting a weapon into a machine gun, and any combination of parts from which a machine gun can be assembled if such parts are in the possession or under the control of a person.''.\n \n (b) CONFORMING AMENDMENT TO PROVISIONS SETTING FORTH CRIMINAL PENALTIES.-Section 1(c) of the Act of July 8, 1932 (47 Stat. 651; sec. 22-4501(c), D.C. Official Code) is amended to read as follows: ''(c) 'Machine gun', as used in this Act, has the meaning given such term in section 101(10) of the Firearms Control Regulations Act of 1975.''\n \n SEC. 5. REPEAL REGISTRATION REQUIREMENT.\n \n (a) REPEAL OF REQUIREMENT.-\n \n (1) IN GENERAL.-Section 201(a) of the Firearms Control Regulations Act of 1975 (sec. 7-2502.01(a), D.C. Official Code) is amended by striking ''any firearm, unless'' and all that follows through paragraph (3) and inserting the following: ''any firearm described in subsection (c).''.\n \n (2) DESCRIPTION OF FIREARMS REMAINING ILLEGAL.-Section 201 of such Act (sec. 7-2502.01, D.C. Official Code) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection: ''(c) A firearm described in this subsection is any of the following: ''(1) A sawed-off shotgun. ''(2) A machine gun. ''(3) A short-barreled rifle.''.\n \n (3) CONFORMING AMENDMENT.-The heading of section 201 of such Act (sec. 7-2502.01, D.C. Official Code) is amended by striking ''Registration requirements'' and inserting ''Firearm Possession''.\n \n (b) CONFORMING AMENDMENTS TO FIREARMS CONTROL REGULATIONS ACT.-The Firearms Control Regulations Act of 1975 is amended as follows: (1) Sections 202 through 211 (secs. 7-2502.02 through 7-2502.11, D.C.

Because i would love to see that statistic, and then i will respond to it. \n \n But first, let me ask you something you never consider, that being a common sense question. How many cases of school shootings have actually occurred in america, 12? 20? Maybe even 100 whackos who have attacked schools, which i think is a high number. And how many ccp holders are their in america? 20 million, 30 million? Or even more? \n \n So first show the number, in millions, of conceal carry permit holders in america, and then show how many actual school shootings have taken place in america, which is a number somewhere between 10 and 100 i would guess, and then tell us what percentage of gun crimes that represents in america that were committed by carry permit holders. Let's see how scary a number that is statistically. It should be somewhere in the range of 1-100th of 1 percent of the number of CCP holders in America.\n \n And a more interesting stat would be, how many ccp holders played any role in any of those school shootings?

   "wrong\n\n \n What? We provided the exact text of the bill versus Brady propaganda, and yet we're somehow wrong?

It's a scary scenario in a city where political protests, presidential motorcades and visits by foreign dignitaries are routine. The only reason this bill has advanced is because the NRA has threatened to withhold endorsements from conservative Democrats in tough races this year.\n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/07/AR2008090701982.html\n\n \n Nowhere does H.R. 6691 mention any thing about this. I dare you to claim otherwise, because you'll have no evidence.\n \n \nIt would even allow teenagers and children to carry loaded assault rifles by repealing all age restrictions on the possession of long guns (H.R. 6691 \u00a7 5(b)(1)). This means that law enforcement could not stop anti-government protesters armed with assault rifles or .50 caliber sniper rifles from patrolling near federal buildings or motorcade routes. \n http://www.bradycampaign.org/xshare/pdf/fedleg/HR6691-summary.pdf\n\n \n Once again, Brady propaganda has poisoned your mind. Nowhere does it say anything at all about legalizing carrying assault weapons in public. Why do you continue debating even though the truth and the evidence is piled against you? The only thing you have to go on is propaganda, while we have government articles.\n \n \nOnce again the NRA bullies people to get what it wants even if more innocent people die.\n\n \n I'd bet my bottom dollar that you have a personal grudge against gun owners.

First there was your statement that hellfire trigger devices turned any firearm they were mounted on into a true machinegun, and then when we pointed out your falseness you changed your claim and said that they let normal firearms fire \"as fast as machineguns\" which isn't the same thing and isn't even the truth.

In the back of my Suburban, I have built a rifle rack padded with carpet. Rifle cases are large, and this rack allows me to transport a larger number of rifles in a smaller area. My rifles go from the safe directly to the truck and then back again, when I return home. Perfectly safe and perfectly legal where I live. This same activity in DC could get you arrested on a serious gun related charge, all because the wording of the law is easily misunderstood.\n \n JW",

   "Mr. Brady, you and others like you should get into acting, yall would make fantastic drama actors. How do yall figure that if law biding D.C. residents are allowed to own legal firearms in their homes, that all of the sudden children and residents will somehow flow into the streets with fully automatic assault weapons, and .50 cal sniper rifles, and all the other weapons yall talk about. By the way, you forgot army tanks, and military jet fighters, grenade launchers, military attack helos, and land owners who keep aircraft carriers in their stock tanks, or how about people using their chimneys for missle silos. You need to quit telling lies and be honest for a change, allowing D.C. residents to keep legal firearms in their homes has no effect on the other laws pertaining to the carrying of guns in public. If more guns means more violence, why do the majority of facts dispute that, why is it in all my years of owning guns I have never seen even one incident at the gun range or at a gun show. I feel safer at gun shows and the gun ranges than I do in my local wal-mart or school. History has always show that gun control and registration lead to gun bans, and gun bans lead to a tyrannical government who then exterminates its citizens because they dont fit in to the new era. Is this what you are trying to accomplish. If not then why dont you leave honest, harmless, law-biding gun owners alone and go after criminals and the judicial system that babies them. Quit letting criminals out of prison until they do the full length of their sentence, quit letting criminals off on technicalities, and quit making plea bargains with criminals. Toughen up laws and fully enforce those laws, and crime might start reducing. One day in the near future, I hope to enter politics, and my intention will be to work for the people, not lobbyist, or orginizations, or peers who seek to take any rights away from the people. And at the same time try to force politicians who dont care about the people, or the rights of the people, out of the office they so poorly represent. Almost all the gun control you geneiouses have passed ended up as miserable failures in crime reduction. The gun control issue will not only cost Obama the election, but I predict some politicians will also be voted out of office because of their stand on gun control.",

Brady I just have to know one more thing and then I am going to bed, question is, if the DC gun laws are repealed, will the dogs be packing 9mm pistols while in public, or do you think they will keep them in their dog houses for personal protection. If fido kills the neighbors poodle in self defence, will fido face criminal prosecution.\n\n well you dont have much of an argument because you can only make fun of me but cant produce the law that says it couldnt happen",

   "Brady, why do I even need to produce proof of those laws, all one has to do is simply go to a state or municipality web-site and the laws are right there for all to see. I wouldnt make fun of you if you would simply think about what you say before you say it, like when you said that children would be toting machine guns around in public in public, young children, even if they got ahold of a machine gun, cannot chamber a machine gun because they lack the physical strength to do so, therefore the gun is rendered useless in the first place. I cant even get a machine gun without either going to the black market, or obtaining a class three gun liscense. This may come as quite a shock to you, but nearly all lawfull gun owners dont even want to own fully automatic weapons, so we dont have them in our homes, which means children cant get ahold of them either. All I want as a lawfull gun owner is to be able to go game hunting, shoot my guns at the range, to be able to protect myself at home and in public, and enjoy those freedoms without fear of loosing them. I have had guns stolen in the past and that makes me a victim, not a criminal, and never once in my 41 years have I experienced an accidental shooting, or a child getting one of my guns. you say you want to curb gun violence in America, but the problem is you try to accomplish this by going after the people who are not breaking any laws. As a lawfull gun owner, I would support you 100% if you went after the criminals that break our laws, if you worked at making penalties harsher against criminals, if you would make the justice system fully enforce sentences handed down against criminals. Im all for laws against straw purchasers, im for laws making people who let children get their guns be held accountable, and believe it or not I would even support a background check for private gun sales if it was free for me to do that background check. I would support any law that target criminals, but I will not support you as long as you target lawfull gun owners. In a way, gun ownership has a lot in common with the country of Iraq, you have good and bad people both there, but you dont eliminate the bad ones by killing the good ones in the process.",

   "Among its findings:\n \n In addition to military-style assault rifles, the bill would allow open carrying of .50 caliber sniper rifles, capable of destroying armored personnel carriers, aircraft and bulk fuel and ammunition sites. These guns can penetrate several inches of steel, a three and a half inch manhole cover, or a 600-pound safe. They are accurate at up to 2,000 yards, and can inflict effective damage to targets over four miles away. \n \n \n The bill would allow people on terrorist watch lists to possess and carry assault rifles in the Capital city as long as they did not yet have a criminal or other record that otherwise prohibited them. \n \n \n The bill would allow many people who have committed a violent or drug-related misdemeanor crime to possess a gun. \n Proponents of the bill claim it is needed to \"restore Second Amendment rights in the District of Columbia\" even though the Supreme Court's June 26, 2008 decision on the Second Amendment in D.C. v. Heller does not mandate the \"any gun, anywhere\" policy of H.R. 6691. \n Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence\n \n so the NRA is so stupid to believe that the second amendment means terrorists can tote around assault rifles",
