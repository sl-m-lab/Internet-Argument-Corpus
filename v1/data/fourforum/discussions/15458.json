   "With the Debt Ceiling still undecided I read today that the Democrats are now talking about proposing that the Debt Limit is Unconstitutional, therefore giving Obama the Power to continue borrowing in order to pay debt that is owed.

Debt ceiling does not prevent payment of debt per se but it does require spending cuts or tax increases. This is like finding out your uncle is no longer going to slip you an extra 300 bucks a month. You can either get a part time job, scale back on your crack habit, or perhaps look to see if you can spend less per month on pay per view. It is all basic economics really. \n \n Second, The Dems SHOULD be stay away from this challenge like the plague. it would be political suicide for the party to champion the cause of unlimited spending. This is NOT an argument voters are likely to favor given our present economic condition.",
