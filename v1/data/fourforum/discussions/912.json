   "For thoes that have read the Tao of physics what were your thoughts?\n For thoes who have read the Tao Te Ching what is your interpration of chapter 42?\n I would like to start a discussion on Taoism as a helpful tool for structuring thought. Christians are encouraged to partisapate as Taoism deals with the relationship between the holy trinity. For individuals to gain anything from Taoism partisipation is important as Taoism as an artform activates unused parts of the human mind.\n \n If it was my intent to use this forum as a means of showing how clever I was I would simply have writen five pages in the Science or Phylosify sections. As you can see I cant spell any way so dont be shy.\n \n The key to eastern thought is understanding the relationship between the universal oppisites yin and yang. Does any one have a opinion?\n \n Tao without substance-\n Invisible-\n Ever-creating\n \n \n Forever creating",

   "I asked Zombie if DNA was oppisite in any way to RNA. His response was the oppisite of hot water was cold water. I take this statement to mean that oppisites are abstract in that it depends who you ask. The consept of oppisties to the western mind remands a largely abstract concept. To the eastern mind the oppisites or duality lie at the heart of thier world view. When one looks for order in the universe the easyest pattern to see is the way absolutely everything can be said to be either part of yin or Yang.\n \n Matter/Space, Day/Night, Male Female, left/right, hot/cold and of course body/soul. The key to understanding western thought is the relationship between these universal oppisites.\n \n Matter is space as its fields create space. Day and Night is just the rotation of the one planet. Male and female are each one half of the human condition. Left and Right are directions with in the same space. Our bodies reflect our spiritual bodies.\n \n In the Eastern mind oppisites doesnt mean different they see the oppisites as the same things. Differnt sides of the same coin. They can not be seperated and are one. Eastern phiosiphy says these oppisites are born of unity. The division of this unity makes all this possible. The oppisites create balance. This balance between the oppistes reflect the original unity. They see the creation as a cycle between unity and duality that never ends. They call this movement the cyclical nature of all things. This pattern of creation is discribed in the Tao Te Ching by Lao Tzu. Chapter 42:\n \n The Tao\n gives birth to universe\n The One \n gives birth to energy and timespace\n The Two\n gives birth to matter\n The Three give birth to every living thing\n All living things are held in yin and carry yang\n And they are held together in the chi of teeming energy.\n \n The Tao \n gives birth to the universe\n The One \n gives birth to galactic super clusters and dark matter\n The Two\n gives birth to the galaxy\n The Three give birth to every living thing\n All living things are held in yin and carry yang\n And they are held togther in the chi of teeming energy.\n \n The Tao\n gives birth to the galaxy\n The One\n gives birth to the galactic core and spiral\n The Two \n gives birth to the Solar System\n The three give birth to all living things\n All living things are held in yin and carry yang\n And they are held together in the chi of teeming energy\n \n The Tao \n gives birth to the solar system\n The One\n gives birth to the sun and planets\n The Two\n gives birth to the Earth Plain\n The three give birth to all living things\n All living things are held in yin and carry yang\n And they are held together in the chi of teeming energy\n \n The Tao\n gives birth to the Earth Plain\n The One\n gives birth to the Atmosphere and Geoshere\n The Two\n give birth to the Hydrosphere\n The Three give birth to the Biosphere\n All living things are held in yin and carry yang\n And they are held together in the Chi of teeming energy\n \n The Tao\n gives birth to the Biosphere\n The One \n gives birth to RNA and DNA\n The Two\n give birth to Ammino Acids\n The Three give birth to all living things\n All living things are held in yin and carry yang\n And they are held together in the Chi of teeming energy.\n \n The Tao\n gives birth to the Biosphere\n The One\n gives birth to the Male and Female\n The Two \n give birth to Love\n The Three give birth to all living things\n All living things are held in yin and carry yang\n And they are held together in the Chi of teeming energy.\n \n The Tao \n gives birth to the atom\n The one\n gives birth to the proton and electron\n The Two\n gives birth to the Proton\n The three gives birth to the periodic table\n All living things are held in yin and carry yang\n And they are held together in the Chi of teeming energy.\n \n The thing is this also solves big bang theory. There is no accepted theory to date that explains the stability of the fabric of timespace and the restraint on expansion. 42 would sugest two universes were created with oppisite properties. This balance like the balance I have just shown would alow an envirionment sutable for life to evolve.\n \n Chritians may substitute God for Tao. This order implys creation. The Taoists refered to this order/creation as the Way. They stressed that not even way was an acceptable word to discribe the act of creation. This is because they saw the act of creation all around them and beileved it was the work of the creator. The Taoists were similar to the jews as they bieleved it was not acceptable to name God. To the Taoists God would remain nameless. They said the Tao that is spoken of is not the true Tao. Tao means way. Way of Life.",

   "I'm not exactly sure what the debate here is, but I do disagree with the view you expressed about opposites. Opposites basically means you cannot have two things at the same time. Either its this or that. It doesn't mean completely opposite in every way. Saying heads or tails isn't an opposite is fine as long as you interprete opposite to mean different in every way. Perhaps this is the meaning in Eastern nations. However, since the Western definition of it is different, that doesn't mean it is wrong or that Eastern is wrong or right either. If our words have different meanings, then you have to take that into consideration. Using the Western definition, heads and tails are opposites on a coin just as male and female are opposite and night and day are opposite. I think you will agree with this.",

It is a molecule and I can't imagine what the opposite of DNA would be. It certainly isn't RNA as prometheus wants to say. So RNA isn't attracted to DNA because of opposite charge.\n \n Anyway, I think you're right.

In terms of molecular biology the opposite of living molicules would be inert molecules say a rock. If it was in iterms of air living creatures it would be a bird.

   "Well it depends on what context you say horse. In a sexual context the opposite would be a mair.\n\n I don't mean to be picky, but it wouldn't. Horse covers a lot of ground from Mustang to Tennessee Walker to Arabian and others. But the opposite of none of them is mare. An unaltered male horse is a stallion, a female is a mare, and a castrated male is a gelding. A pony is a small breed of horse, a colt is an immature stallion and a filly is an immature mare. I don't see any opposites in there anywhere except maybe \"opposite sex.\" And that's because there are only two, at least for any species with which you have any familiarity. There are some organisms that have more than one sex and there are some that have only one sex.\n \nIn terms of molecular biology the opposite of living molicules would be inert molecules say a rock.\n\n You really have a fixation on reducing everything to only two alternatives, don't you?\n \nIf it was in iterms of air living creatures it would be a bird.\n\n I have no idea what that means. Is it your assertion that neither you nor I live in the air?\n \nIf you were a physicist you would say the horse consists of matter and that the opposite of matter is energy.\n\n Just not true. E=mc^2. Matter is energy in another form.\n \nSo it all depends apon the obsever.\n\n That doesn't follow from what you have said. In fact, it isn't even related to the discussion so far.\n \nThe rational of Newtonian physics is very much alive. Yet Realitiviy proves that Newtonian physics is very much wrong.\n\n And quantum mechanics \"proves\" that relativity is wrong. But Newtonian physics is used to send men to the moon. The difference is that Newtonian physics works on the scale that is observable, general relativity works on the scale of the very, very large, and quantum mechanics works on the scale of the very, very small. And yet, each describes the same reality. So it must be that that at least two are imprefect.\n \nThe speed of light is constant to you no matter your velocity. So you see it is your perspective that is important as thier is no absolute in this universe.\n\n Actually, the speed of light is constant in any inertial frame of reference. I'm not so sure that \"perspective\" is the right word.\n \nThe romans put miles stones along thier roads as points of reference. Thier are no mile stones in space. Everything is relitive to not only your position in time space but also the way you interperate the information you recieve.\n\n Well, I guess. If you want. I'm not sure what that says. It certainly isn't science and doesn't address any scientific questions.\n \nLight matter and just about everything has been found to have a dual nature. That is they seem to be acting in oppoite ways at the same time. Matter and Energy act as if they are both waves and particles. They display the properties of both. The answer you get depends in which context it is asked.\n\n OK. That is true. But my problem with all of your positive/negative, opposites stuff is that the very concept of \"opposite\" is relative - sometimes it isn't meaningful, as in the opposite of horse or the opposite of DNA. You call me a reductionist and it is I who is arguing against the reduction of everything to only two alternatives. Reality is more complicated than that.\n \nI would suggest this is becuase time itself is not constant. Thier is no point in the universe that would have exactly the same dilation of time as any other. This is because gravity dilutes time.\n\n Right. And that idea is now almost 100 years old. I haven't seen anything that you have said that is anything more than some sort of strange mysticism or pretty standard science. To be honest, I don't see the need for the mysticism.\n \nThier are endless amounts of gravitational fields they all over lap creating these distortions in the fabric of space time. Trying to identify time is like tying to find the hieght of a wave on the occean.\n\n But the height of a wave on the ocean is easily determined. Trough to crest. Why is that difficult? And I have a pretty good sense of time in my inertial frame of reference. I had a dog that used to sit on the back of the sofa every day at about the time I usually got home. She had a really good sense of time in her inertial frame of reference.\n \nLight opperates at zero time.\n\n It does? So the light from a star that is 120 million light years away reaches me immediatly?\n [quote]We ask light what it is, based on what we know to be true in this space time. Sub atomic particles are asked if they are either particles or waves the answer we get is that they are both. This is because the creation does not obay our concept of what is real. Time is an illusion. This is why we never get to the future and are always in the present.\n \n [snip irrelevant pseudo-scientific poetic, meaningless claptrap]\n \n \nMaster Lao Tzu was a sage. To understand a sage one must think like a sage. We stole most of what is good in our society from the chinese.\n\n Nonsense! You need to try to get in touch with reality. Tao isn't it. For some reason you have been carried off into this mystical realm where everything becomes so simple.\n \nBut I think we left behind the best bit. The way they think.\n\n I'm sure. But if the way they think is so wonderful, why is the way you think so absolutely convoluted? What is it about Tao that would prompt you to offer opinion on topics that are completely beyond your understanding? Tao says that everything has an opposite to it must be that DNA is opposite to RNA. Claptrap and balderdash! And you had the gall to call me a reductionist?\n \nThese people were monothiests long before Moses met the burning bush.\n\n And that unsupported tidbit is meaningful because....? Understand I don't know that it isn't true. I just don't see how it is relevant to the discussion. You'll have to explain the following: So what?",

   "One of the definitions of a living organism is the ablility to reproduce. Your horse may not reproduce. In order to view individuals with in a spieces as representives of thier gene pool one must take into acount thier ability to reproduce. The only corect definition of a horse as a living organism is infact a pair. One male One Female. Only when these two oppisites unite in the act of procreation can they be defined as a living organism. Thats what the text books say. This is why also a person somtimes reffers to thier partner as thier other half. The sexual oppisites unite to create the whole. These oppisites are each one half of the same thing. Your horse alone may not be defined as a living organism. Beware the trap of reductionism my friend.\n \n You are quite correct energy is matter. The oppisite of energy is timespace. You are also quite correct niether Realitvity, Newtonian or Quantam theory can correctly define the universe as a hole. Seeing it is just one universe we are talking about that would suggest the scientific method is flawed. I believe I have corectly defined the relationships between all levels of creation that is why I follow the Tao.",

If I am incorect prove it.\n\n \n Well, lets start with the question has the system of Eastern thought been continually successful as it was in the past? The answer to that is no. Science is based on logical thinking. Logic can be twisted as you have shown. However Western logic dictates that there are opposites even if they are not different in everyway. The Sun and Moon are opposites. Why? Because Night and Day are opposite. Why? Because light and dark are opposites. Why? You can continue on forever. I would ask why question such things?\n \n So has Chinese thought helped it scientifically compared to Western thought? As I answered earlier, no it hasn't. Is China shifting more towards Western thought when it comes to science, I'd hope so else they will never catch up.\n \n Your version of thinking that Chinese thoughts can provide answers to anything very simply is correct. If you want you can calmly accept that what you have stated is correct because in theory it is possible that the answers you provided are correct. However, the Chinese method has no way of check the accuracy of those answers the way that Western style thinkers do. We obsess over labeling things as right and wrong, black and white, this or that. We label things based on our analysis while the Eastern thinkers may be content doing far less than that and just accepting that they are enlightened by the fact that they don't wonder about these things.\n \n Opposites are never going to be the same thing, even in Eastern thought as you suggested. Heads and Tails will always have different names so they are inherently different although they can be part of the same coin. They wouldn't be labeled differently if they were the same and you wouldn't ever refer to them separately if they were the same. If you were to never refer to anything as if it were different and unique you would have a difficult time communicating. Calling and viewing night and day the same thing for instance would be rough.\n \n Still you have to see that Western and Eastern thinkers have different ideas of what opposite means. Since this is the case, how can you debate the two against each other? Your definition of opposite basically makes the word useless. My definition of it helps me label things, define things, and analyze it. As a Western thinker would say, it would be like comparing apples to oranges although I'm sure you would debate these are not so different.\n \n Also I don't believe either side can be proven correct through a debate. I can show you proof that opposites exist while you will deny that I have shown you anything. I can show you that Western thought is more successful scientifically while you can debate that Western thought only seems successful because it is based on flawed ideas and theories. I could show you that Eastern thought is trending more towards Western though but you would debate that as a Westerner you have trended towards Eastern thought and that both truly are not so different from each other. I would even try to debate that the Western world is on the opposite side of the planet as the Eastern world and you would debate that West and East are part of the same compass. There is no need to debate this however since the fact of the matter is that you can never prove that a bird is an airplane or that an airplane is a bird. They are similar but different just as our opinions on what opposite means are.",
