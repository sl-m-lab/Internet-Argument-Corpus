   "http://www.discover.com/issues/sep-05/departments/discover-dialogue\n \n \n Meteorologist William Gray may be the world's most famous hurricane expert. . . .\n A few years ago, you almost called it quits because you'd lost so much funding. What made you continue? \n \n G: I don't have the budget that I had, so I have cut my project way back. I am in retirement. I'm still working every day, but I don't teach and I don't have as many graduate students and as much financial need. I've got a little money from Lexington Insurance out of Boston, and I have some National Science Foundation money. For years I haven't had any NOAA, NASA, or Navy money. But I'm having more fun. Right now I'm trying to work on this human-induced global-warming thing that I think is grossly exaggerated.\n \n You don't believe global warming is causing climate change?\n \n G: No. If it is, it is causing such a small part that it is negligible. I'm not disputing that there has been global warming. There was a lot of global warming in the 1930s and '40s, and then there was a slight global cooling from the middle '40s to the early '70s. And there has been warming since the middle '70s, especially in the last 10 years. But this is natural, due to ocean circulation changes and other factors. It is not human induced.\n \n  That must be a controversial position among hurricane researchers. \n \n G: Nearly all of my colleagues who have been around 40 or 50 years are skeptical as hell about this whole global-warming thing. But no one asks us. If you don't know anything about how the atmosphere functions, you will of course say, \"Look, greenhouse gases are going up, the globe is warming, they must be related.\" Well, just because there are two associations, changing with the same sign, doesn't mean that one is causing the other.\n \n  With last year's hurricane season so active, and this year's looking like it will be, won't people say it's evidence of global warming? \n \n G: The Atlantic has had more of these storms in the least 10 years or so, but in other ocean basins, activity is slightly down. Why would that be so if this is climate change? The Atlantic is a special basin? The number of major storms in the Atlantic also went way down from the middle 1960s to the middle '90s, when greenhouse gases were going up. \n \n  Why is there scientific support for the idea? \n \n G: So many people have a vested interest in this global-warming thing-all these big labs and research and stuff. The idea is to frighten the public, to get money to study it more. Now that the cold war is over, we have to generate a common enemy to support science, and what better common enemy for the globe than greenhouse gases?\n \n  Are your funding problems due in part to your views? \n \n G: I can't be sure, but I think that's a lot of the reason. I have been around 50 years, so my views on this are well known. I had NOAA money for 30 some years, and then when the Clinton administration came in and Gore started directing some of the environmental stuff, I was cut off. I couldn't get any NOAA money. They turned down 13 straight proposals from me.\nI wish that Professor Gray had mentioned precisely when these funding cuts occurred, as well as describing the proposals that were turned down.",

   "Actually, it doesn't show that at all. It was already explained to you that one of the reasons may have been to lure settlers, just as Iceland was called Iceland to discourage too many settlers. Another story is that Iceland was discovered in the winter and Greenland was discovered in the summer.\n \n At any rate, there never was a time in at least the last 250,000 years when Greenland wasn't covered with ice. The researchers that I talked to said that the ice was about 9000 ft thick where they were taking cores. There is a band of land around the edge that is several miles wide in some places. I have been told that it is actually green during the summer in southern Greenland. Where I was, it was mostly rocks with a few fields where some things grew.

Sea-surface temperatures in the Labrador Sea also fell. \n \n Globally, temperatures have risen over this period (+0.53 C) and in Greenland itself scientists have recently reported fairly dramatic thinning of the island's ice sheet. \n \n But Dr Edward Hanna, from the Institute of Marine Studies at the University of Plymouth, UK, said that, as with all climate science, a fuller picture emerges when long-term data are taken into account. \n \n Climate phenomenon\n \n \"It really depends on what timescale you are looking at,\" he told BBC News Online. \n \n \"Certainly in the late 1990s, there was some warming but that's just over a very short period. There are a lot of natural cycles in regional climate and if you take a longer trend over the last 40 or 50 years then there has been a statistically significant cooling, particularly in south-western coastal Greenland.\" \n BBC News \n Tuesday, 11 March, 2003, 16:22 GMT \n",

I haven't followed global warming as closely as creationism, but I will say that creationism is based completely on belief, and not on the evidence. Yes, even a scientist can have a religious belief that trumps their better judgement when looking at the evidence. BTW, the vast majority of these scientists who BELIEVE in creationism are NOT biologists, so their opinion lies outside their field of expertise.\n\n \n I would say science is a belief system as well.

I looked at 9 different sources to see if any of them defined science as a belief system. Guess how many mentioned the word \"faith\" or \"belief\". Go ahead, guess.\n \n The following (from Wikipedia Science Portal) is similar to most of the other sources but a bit more consise.\n \n \"A science, from the Latin, scire, to know, is a body of knowledge that is constructed via observation, hypothesis, experimentation, and logic for the purpose of explaining and predicting events or behavior.\"\n \n The sources I checked were Britannica, Encarta (2 editions), World Book (text and CD editions), American Heritage Dictionary of Science, Dictionary of Modern Biology, Merriam-Webster Dictionary, and Wikipedia.\n \n Claims that science is based on faith are ploy by creationists in an effort to bring science down to the level of unsupported belief that is religion.",
