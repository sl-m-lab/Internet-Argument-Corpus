Launched at the University of Virginia in 1996, the day takes place year after year in the long tradition of peaceful, powerful student statements. Students on college, high school and middle school campuses take vows of silence to call attention to homophobia in the schools.\n \n How does the uncompassionate right respond?\n \n The Christian Conservatives for Cutting Class call for a walkout.\n \n \"The implicit purpose of the Day of Silence is to undermine the belief that homosexuality is immoral,\" the groups said in a statement. \"It is the belief of the sponsors of the walkout that parents should no longer passively accept the political usurpation of taxpayer-funded public school classrooms through student silence.\"\n \n \"This day is not about 'tolerance' as it claims, but about forcing propaganda and acceptance of high-risk behavior into the schools with no opposing views allowed,\" said Linda Harvey of the Mission America Coalition.\n \n Last week's A Day of Silence and those that have come before and will come after are not about forcing propaganda on students.\n \n The day deals with high-risk behavior, but not what Linda Harvey implied as high-risk behavior. The day deals with high-risk behavior such as the bullying and harassment of GLBT youth and allies that too school teachers, principals and other administrators ignore.\n \n The cards participants distribute on A Day of Silence read, \"My deliberate silence echoes that silence, which is caused by anti-LGBT bullying, name-calling and harassment.\n \n \"I believe that ending the silence is the first step toward building awareness and making a commitment to address these injustices. Think about the voices you are not hearing today.\"\n \n I know it was a long time ago that I attended junior high and high school, but surveys of students show that what I learned in school is still the rule today. It still is far more common to see a teacher punish a student for chewing gum than for verbally harassing a gay student. Blow a bubble and the punishment might be detention. Call a kid a \"fag\" and go on your way, day after day.\n \n The anti-GLBT abuse that A Day of Silence spotlights does more than hurt feelings.\n \n Nearly nine out of 10 GLBT youth report being verbally harassed at school because of their sexual orientation, according to the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network.\n \n Nearly 44 percent of GLBT students report being physically harassed, and about a quarter of GLBT students report being physically assaulted.\n \n The abuse can make school unbearable.\n \n A GLSEN survey in Michigan schools found that the grade-point average of GLBT students who were more frequently physically harassed because of their sexual orientation was a half grade lower than of students who were less frequently harassed.\n \n The abuse sometimes can make life unbearable.\n \n Last week in Springfield, Mass., hundreds of people attended the funeral of 11-year-old Carl Walker-Hoover, who hanged himself after enduring months of anti-gay harassment at the New Leadership Charter School.\n \n There was no leadership at Carl's school. Despite his mother's repeated complaints about the bullying, school administrators did nothing to help.\n \n Carl would have celebrated his 12th birthday April 17 - it was A Day of Silence that spoke volumes about the climate in the classrooms, in part due to the thousands of GLBT students and their allies who took a vow of silence but also, in part, due to the efforts of Homophobes for Hookie.",
