And senior Iraqi leaders said they would make a last-ditch effort on Friday to strike a deal.\n \n But after so many days of fruitless negotiations, some senior political leaders here suggested that time had run out.\n \n \"There are still some negotiations, but if we don't have any compromise, then that's it,\" said Sheik Khalid al-Atiyya, a Shiite negotiator. \"We will go to the election to vote on it.\"\n \n A decision by the Shiites to move ahead without the Sunnis would be a considerable blow to efforts by the Bush administration to bring the leaders of the Sunni minority into the negotiations over the constitution.\n \n Sec. of State Rice answered: Others have been active in helping them, but this is by all means an Iraqi process. \n \n Mr. Bush and American officials here have expressed hope that bringing the Sunnis into the drafting of the constitution could help coax them into the political mainstream, and ultimately begin to undercut support for the guerrilla insurgency. The Sunnis largely boycotted the parliamentary elections in January.\n \n In recent weeks, Sunni leaders across north and central Iraq have begun telling their communities to register for and vote in the Oct. 15 referendum on the constitution and in the parliamentary elections scheduled for December. That trend could be endangered if Sunni leaders are not part of a deal on the constitution.\n \n Indeed, the events of Thursday raised the prospect that the Sunnis would try to reject the constitution when it goes before the voters. Under the rules agreed to last year, a two-thirds majority voting against the constitution in any three of Iraq's 18 provinces would send the document down to defeat. The Sunnis are thought to constitute a majority in three provinces.\n \n By Thursday night, Sunni leaders were declaring that they had been victimized by the majority Shiites, and they were already making plans to sink the constitution at the polls.\n \n \"We will call on people to say no to this constitution,\" said Kamal Hamdoun, a Sunni leader who is head of the Iraqi Bar Association. \"This constitution was written by the powerful people, not by the people.\"\n \n \"This constitution achieved the ambitions of the people who are in power,\" he added.\n \n The Sunni leaders adamantly oppose language in the constitution that could allow the Shiites to create a vast autonomous region in the oil-rich southern part of the country. In the current draft, the constitution says each province may form its own federal region and join with others.\n \n In the debate over autonomous regions, the Kurds, who already have one such region in the north, largely stood on the sidelines. But the Sunnis say that such an arrangement could cripple the Iraqi state, and that the Shiite autonomous region would probably fall under the sway of their Shiite-dominated neighbor, Iran.\n \n Despites their protests, there are widespread doubts about the sincerity of the Sunni negotiators. Most of the 15 members of the Sunni negotiating committee were members of Saddam Hussein's Baath Party, and there is a growing sense among Shiite leaders that their primary goal is to block any agreement at all.\n \n In any case, the Shiite leadership has been ardent in its desire to set up a Shiite-dominated autonomous region, particularly Abdul Aziz Hakim, a cleric and the leader of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq. As advocated by Mr. Hakim, the Shiite region would comprise nine of Iraq's 18 provinces, nearly half the nation's population and its richest oil fields.\n \n Mr. Hakim and many of the senior members of his group, the Supreme Council, lived for many years in Iran and even fought on the Iranian side during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980's. The Supreme Council is suspected by American officials of receiving large amounts of assistance from the Iranian government.\n \n The effort by the Shiites to bypass the Sunnis began Thursday afternoon, when they canceled a meeting of the Iraqi National Assembly, which was set to gather, and possibly vote, on the final draft constitution. While many Iraqi leaders first interpreted that decision as simply a delay, the Shiites made it clear that they were considering bypassing the Assembly altogether and of forgoing any further changes to the document.\n \n Because the majority Shiites dominate the National Assembly, there is little the Sunnis can do to stop them from writing whatever constitution they choose.\n \n The concern that a deal on the constitution was falling apart appeared to have to prompted Mr. Bush to call Mr. Hakim to urge a comprise. One Iraqi official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said the Americans, who have already expressed their frustration with the Sunnis, have recently become irritated with what they regard as the stubbornness of the Shiites as well.\n \n \"The Americans are very angry that the Shia are not agreeing on this,\" the Iraqi official said. \"They really want them to make these concessions to the Sunnis to keep them on board.\"\n \n \"They think that without keeping the Sunnis on board, many things will go wrong, including the security,\" the official said.\n \n The other outstanding issue was whether the constitution would contain language banning any remnants or symbols of the Baath Party, which was dominated by Sunnis. The Sunnis are concerned that this may lead to their exclusion from government jobs and that they will be unfairly discriminated against in public life.\n \n While some Iraqi leaders expressed hope that more negotiations would produce a breakthrough, there was also evidence that the more they talked, the more the distance between them grew.\n \n When the negotiations began Thursday morning, Sunnis came in with an ambitious list of demands on issues like federalism and de-Baathification, both of which they ardently oppose and would like to excise from the constitution.\n \n Quippped Sec. of State Rice: This is truly a democratic process. \n \n As the day wore on, no breakthrough materialized. \"We discussed all the articles that we have a problem with, but we didn't find any solution,\" said Haseeb Aref, one of the Sunni negotiators.\n \n Meanwhile, some of the Sunnis maintained that after all the missed deadlines, the current government had lost its own legal standing.\n \n Under the language of the interim constitution currently in force, the National Assembly is required to dissolve itself if it does not complete a new constitution by the deadline, unless it amends the constitution. It failed to do either one of those on Thursday.\n \n \"The process was illegal,\" said Kamal Hamdoun, the Sunni member of the committee. \"They don't have a right to extend.\"\n \n Retorted Sec. of State Rice: Now, when it comes to various groups, including the Kurds, that have particular interests at stake, it's not surprising in a democratic process that people continue to press for certain outcomes, but ultimately, these documents are, by their very nature, documents that embody compromises.\n \n At a news briefing late Thursday evening, Hachem al-Hassani, the speaker of the National Assembly, felt compelled to respond to those allegations. He said he believed that the assembly had proceeded strictly according to the law.\n \n As common ground fell away, leaders of the majority Shiites expressed confidence that the Sunnis would fail to muster the necessary two-thirds majority in three provinces to sink the constitution.\n \n Ordinary Sunnis, said Ali al-Dabbagh, a Shiite leader, \"do not all have the same views and the same ideas.\" As a result, he said, opponents of the constitution \"will not get 'no' in the referendum.\"\n \n Mr. Hassani, a secular Sunni who has supported the Shiite leaders, expressed hope that the talks on Friday would produce the compromise that has eluded negotiators so far.\n \n \"We think the door is still open to find a solution,\" Mr. Hassani said.\n \n Not to be outdone Sec. of State Rice jibed: I think we have to step back a little bit here and recognize that, yes, there was an August 15th deadline to complete the constitution\n",

   "It becomes much more difficult to run someone else's country when they no longer feel your gun at their head. Shia resentment about Sunni power under Saddam isn't just going to vanish in the air because the US wants it that way. Bush has already stated US troops will remain in Iraq until Iraq can militarily stand on its own feet while granting the Kurds autonomy with their own military and arming the Shia. If one were a Sunni, paranoia and anger would be at the forefront of any negotiations. Unless exterminated, 20% of a population prone to violence can make things very difficult for any government.

Do you think the planners of the war were that inept that they really thought we would be out in a year or two?\n \n I'd like to hear your take on it... and anybody else's.\n\n \n It seems to me far more likely that they believed we could have the whole mess cleaned up and be in permanetn bases, with the full support and adoration of the Iraqi people, within 2 years. Our move on Iraq seemed to have a lot more to do with the fact that the Sauds had expelled us form our bases there, and the fact that saddam was selling oil ont he open market in Euros instead of dollars than anything else.\n \n We invaded in order to establish permanent bases there. There are really only 3 countries in the ME with the infrastructure to support large military bases...Iran, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia. All 3 countries have educated populations, developed shipping and transportation facilities, and are reasonably placed for our requirements. I would imagine we chose Iraq because ti was the easiest sell tot he (stupid) american public, and the bushies truly believed that they could depose Saddam and then walk into baghdad as adored heros. Unfortunatly, they bungled the thing so badly, first by placing a premium on the lives of US servicemen instead of innocent civlians, then by failing to provide, or have a network in place to provide, basic services post invasion.\n \n As unemployment swelled in Iraq and the insurgency picked up steam as the number of civilian casualties became apparent, instead of trying to backpedal, admit some fault and trying to make things better, we dubbed the insurgents \"terrorists\" and adopted the same policies of torture and imprisonment that existed under saddam, up to and including bringing some of his top people back.\n \n I think we believed (or at least the XXXXXX int eh bush administration) that we could run Iraq as a puppet country like we have in the past. We underestimated the influence and organizational skills of the clergy, so whe we tried to rig the elections by rigging the media, like we did in Afghanistan, we failed to do so becuase the people were given an alternative means of gettting their information. Our guys lost the election, Iraq is now signing military treaties with Iran and Syria, and as long as US troops are still in Iraq, their safety will be limited to heavily fortified bases. \n \n So, in short, NO, I don't think we ever planned on leaving. I don't think we planned on a long and expensive military seige, either.",

The bases also would be key outposts for Bush administration policy advisers. \n \n \n \n \n As the U.S. scales back its military presence in Saudi Arabia, Iraq provides an option for an administration eager to maintain a robust military presence in the Middle East  and intent on a muscular approach to seeding democracy in the region. The number of U.S. military personnel in Iraq, between 105,000 and 110,000, is expected to remain unchanged through 2006, according to military planners. \n \n \"Is this a swap for the Saudi bases?\" asked Army Brig. Gen. Robert Pollman, chief engineer for base construction in Iraq. \"I don't know. ... When we talk about enduring bases here, we're talking about the present operation, not in terms of America's global strategic base. But this makes sense. It makes a lot of logical sense.\" \n \n Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt, deputy chief of operations for the coalition in Iraq, said the military engineers are trying to prepare for any eventuality. \n \n \"This is a blueprint for how we could operate in the Middle East,\" Kimmitt said. \"[But] the engineering vision is well ahead of the policy vision. What the engineers are saying now is: Let's not be behind the policy decision. Let's make this place ready so we can address policy options.\" \n \n To that end, the U.S. plans to operate from former Iraqi bases in Baghdad, Mosul, Taji, Balad, Kirkuk and in areas near Nasiriyah, near Tikrit, near Fallujah and between Irbil and Kirkuk. \n \n There also are plans to renovate and enhance airfields in Baghdad and Mosul, and rebuild 70 miles of road on the main route for U.S. troops headed north. \n \n \n",
