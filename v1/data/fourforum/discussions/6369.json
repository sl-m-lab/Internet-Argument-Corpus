We talk about cultural hegemonies, yet these hegemonies cannot be directly observed. Only by looking at the effects, can we see this force. We talk about supply and demand, yet how do we observe aggregated supply or demand? We can however observe how the price changes and how the quantities produced and purchased changes and draw conclusions based on that.\n \n Now, don`t get me wrong, I don`t believe in creationism.

   "It's really sad how religion infects the mind and eliminates rational thought.\n\n \n It's truly lamentable. However, I honestly don't believe that thinking critically or rationally is our default position as a species. As we can see here, many people will in fact fight having to do so in order to preserve their feel-good, magical worldview.\n \n Howard Beale: \n It's been a good few month since I've posted here. Maybe I'll stick around this time long enough to hear you use your catch phrase. :)",

   "PS: Thought I'd better add this before you try to push the burden of proof off onto me. YOU made a (very vague) claim that Dembski's The Design Inference \"proves design\" (or something, again, your exact assertion can't be determined because you were far too vague). I am challenging YOUR claim. Thus, the burden of proof is on YOUR shoulders, not mine. So YOU have a position to support. Show us exactly in The Design Inference where Dembski does as you claim.\n\n Dembski has admitted that his explanatory filter (stated in The Design Inference) can yield false negatives; in other words, that one can conclude that something is of natural origin when in fact it was designed by intelligence. However, Dembski maintains that there are no false positives. This has been shown to be untrue. Several reviews of and essays about Dembski's work have offered several examples of the application of the explanatory filter that yield false positives. So what good is it if there is no way to determine false results, both negative and positive?\n \n Dembski, as a result of criticism of his process, significantly changed the definitions of elements of the explanatory filter. For example, in his initial renditions of his \"theory\" (as in The Design Inference), Dembski defines specification as consisting of two necessary components: detachability and delimitation. And detachability, in turn, necessarily comprises two subcomponents: conditional independence and tractability.\n \n Well, that would be well and good, if it worked, but it seems that even Dembski found some problems in his theory. In No Free Lunch, he declares that tractability is no longer a constituent of detachability. He says, \"...I have retained the conditional independence but removed the tractability condition.\" Why? Dembski doesn't say. It seems that the only necessary component of detachability is now conditional independence. Dembski now says that tractability is no longer necessary within detachability but should be moved to his Generic Chance Elimination Argument.\n \n Further, the delimitation condition that was prominently discussed in The Design Inference, is no longer used in No Free Lunch. Again, Dembski offers no explanation as to why this necessary condition has been dropped.\n \n Dembski, always confident of his own genius, also proposes, in addition to the \"three traditional laws of thermodynamics,\" a fourth law of thermodynamics. It seems that no physicist or chemist has noticed this \"fourth law,\" but Dembski has. But it seems to me that if someone is going to represent their expertise on thermodynamics that he should be aware that there already are 4 laws of thermodynamics. Not only that, Dembski's \"4th law\" addresses phenomena that have already been covered by the 2nd law, and therefore, even if it were correct, would not be a new law. However, Dembski's new law actually contradicts the 2nd law.\n \n Perakh, Mark. 2004. Unintelligent Design. Amherst: Prometheus Books. Chap 1.

From his arguments, it seems that he didn't notice that Dembski had changed the explanatory filter.\n \n The Skeptic, can you explain to us why? Please explain the difference between Dembski's two different iterations of the explanatory filter (please go into more detail than I did), why it was changed, why Dembski did not explain why, and why the second statement (in No Free Lunch) is better than the first (in The Design Inference).",
