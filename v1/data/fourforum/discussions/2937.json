The Olympics offer a great deal of good to the world and is to me the greatest source of worldwide peaceful competition and friendship building known to man.\n \n Too bad it's being run by such control freaks.\n \n I can see keeping logos of non-sponsoring companies off of the athletes, but the fans should be able to wear whatever they please.\n \n For many years, there was a cafe here called \"The Olympic Cafe\", a quaint little hole-in-the-wall place with good food and a long history. They were forced to change their name when the OC took rights to the word \"olympic\". What a travesty.",

   "Yea - it's the spectators that will have to turn their clothes inside out, throw away their drink bottles (I suppose they can keep the drink).\n Someone made the promise I suppose, someone on the committee, that if the sponsors would support the Olympics, no other trade name would be allowed inside.\n \n I would just refuse to go, but that&#8217;s not the solution. The Olympics have become an indulgence, not unlike most of our favorite TV channels (reality TV). The OC has gotten to the point that it&#8217;s not the sports (as evident by the particular events) that they support, but are looking out only for themselves. Greed has taken precedence over entertainment.\n \n It reminds me of the young girls&#8217; beauty contests where the mothers have gone completely crazy over the competition and have forgotten the reasons behind it.",

I have to admit last night watching my heart was just not into it, although it could have been I was tired...\n I want that warm gushy feeling you get..like when you watched Seabiscuit.\n I have a huge heart and I will shed a tear at the drop of a hat...Does anyone else have this lack of feeling this time around?",
