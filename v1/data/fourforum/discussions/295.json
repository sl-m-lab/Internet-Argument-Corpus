Also the forgiveness received from Christ takes away guilt and allows us to march on.<\n Also Romans 1:18-22 tells us how God has given some people up to those desires {ie. \"women changing the natural use into that which is agianst nature\" and \"likewise also the men, leaving the natural use with a woman, burned in their lust one toward another\". What that text read as a whole implies is simply that they wanted to live immorally instead of having covenant with God, and so God allowed them. So they will also receive the punishment that comes with their behavior, therefore justice will be served. \n With that said, we also can remember that ever since the garden of Eden, death was and remains the penalty for sin.

   "You want scripture, Benji?\n \n Look to the context of leviticus. It is a list of do-do nots in terms of what should be part of a temple worship. First of all, that falls within your context of \"rituals\" not being important anymore. Second, it also raises an interesting question. Many bible scholars, religious ones at that, wonder why in a section devoted to how to conduct a religious service, god would throw out \"oh by the way, homosexual acts are evil.\" It seems rather random to me and many other scholars as well. The answer to this conundrum is that the Leviticus line you cite is intended to be absolute WITHIN CONTEXT, I.E., don't make homosexual acts part of your temple worship. This is less silly than it sounds, as it would be to draw a clear distinction between the contemporary pagan religions of the area which did conduct such actions in their religious rites. Thus, this was another way to seperate us and them. But to extrapolate that to general conduct is another matter and is unwarrented. There are many religious laws that apply only to temple worship, why isn't this one of them?\n \n Interestingly enough, most Jewish groups (yeah, l'orginal) don't have a problem with sodomy or homosexuality. I've met gay rabbis. There are a couple reasons for this, but they center on a couple key beliefs.\n 1) God is not perfect. Jews are not just permitted but obligated to question and argue with God (and no, He doesn't have to win, remember Abraham?)\n 2) A distinct seperation between church-state. We know that regardless of what God wants with us (and the obsession with our sex lives does seem rather absurd), he'll deal with it himself. In the mean time, laissez-faire is the order of the day, because as humans we have no right to order others to live their lives in a certain manner, nor to cast judgment upon them \"judge not, lest ye be judged.\"\n \n Cheers!",

   "ApathySam,\n My purpose is not to condemn you but to illustrate the sinfulness of the acts involved with homosexuality.\n \n Have you read Romans 1:24-27, \"Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves, because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed for ever! Amen. \n For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. Their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural, and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in their own persons the due penalty for their error.\" Take a look at Leviticus 18:22  also for one of the Old Testament prohibitions.\n \n \nAccording to the Bible, all sin hurts God equally.

   "Hello maximus -- sorry for taking so long to respond.\n \n \nApathySam,\n My purpose is not to condemn you but to illustrate the sinfulness of the acts involved with homosexuality.\n \n\n \n I appreciate that, and I wanted to say off the bat that no offense was taken. Likewise, I'm not at all interested in condemning Christianty.\n \n \n\n Have you read Romans 1:24-27 .... Take a look at Leviticus 18:22  also for one of the Old Testament prohibitions.\n \n\n \n I've read a few different interpretations on Romans 1 written by people trying to justify homosexuality -- several of which even I disagree with. However, one thing seems to be consensus, and this is something I think is fairly clear: Romans 1 is primarily about idolatry and the sinful nature of worshipping artifacts and \"gods\" other than God, not about homosexuality. When put into context, verses 24-27 show homosexuality to be something of a passing remark in a passage wherein Paul is describing the fate of pagans breaking God's first commandment.\n \n Romans 1:21 \"...because, although they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God, nor were thankful, but became futile in their thoughts, and their foolish hearts were darkened.\"\n \n Verses 22 and 23 elaborate on this, and then we get to the infamous 24:\n \n \"Therefore God also gave them up to uncleanness, in the lusts of their hearts, to dishonor their bodies amongst themselves, ...\"\n \n Tacked onto their place right after Romans 1:21-23, Verses 24-27 show \"homosexuality\" to be a sort of punishment for idolatry -- in other words, Paul is still admonishing the sin of idolatry, not homosexuality.\n \n This admittedly opens up a new can of worms. If homosexuality is a punishment for other sins, it can't be good in the eyes of God, right?\n \n I have a couple responses to that:\n \n First off, I put \"homosexuality\" in quote marks earlier because there's a large discrepancy between what Paul alludes to in Romans and what homosexuality is considered to be in our society. Well, I can't speak for all of society, but I'm definitely not alone in defining homosexuality to be a relationship built on love, not sexual attraction. Romans discusses the pure act of homosexual sex -- meaningless sex based on lust in this case. If that's all there was to homosexuality, then gay virgins wouldn't exist, since they wouldn't be homosexuals until they actually had sex. Homosexuality is the ability to love and be attracted to someone of the same sex. If a straight man for whatever reason has sex with other men -- even though he's not at all attracted to them nor has the ability to have any sort of meaningful feelings toward them -- he's still straight. \n \n Secondly -- and this one you might be more inclined to disagree with -- I believe the whole point of the punishment in Romans 1 is to parallel the acts of the pagans. This is the one of the viewpoints I read that I do tend to agree with. God's all about finding a punishment appropriate for the crime, right? In this case, the crime is unnaturally worshipping idols -- remember, they remained pagans \"although they knew God\". Thus it was going against their very nature to worship some other, false entity, but they did it anyway. So God punishes them by forcing them once again to go against their nature -- by lusting after their own sex. These were arguably straight men, not giving into temptation but suddenly forced to go against their own heterosexuality. This kinda ties in with the first point, about the difference between \"homosexuality\" in Romans 1 and homosexuality in our society.\n \n As for Leviticus, I don't really have a response to that. I read some interpretation of that passage by some scholar of ancient Hebrew... something about the use of the word 'abomination', I think... but I forgot exactly what it was and I don't remember being that impressed anyway. However, it's been my experience that many Christians don't even bother quoting Leviticus. I'm sure you know of the \"fulfilling the old covenant\" argument, and both it's sides. I figure if they're not worried about Leviticus, I shouldn't be. emoticon_cool \n \n \n\n There are some sins that are worse than others. \n Read John 19:11  and 2 John 5:16-17. .... Salvation after profession of faith is not guaranteed. \n \n\n \n This was a bit surprising to me. Two people very close to me, both very pious Christians, believe otherwise, as I understand it. This was the main reason I took so long to respond.. I'm still waiting to get ahold of them to ask them about this, but I'll get back to you as soon as I do.\n \n I hope that's not too frustrating, seeing as how that really was the main topic of discussion. *sigh* I'm sorry. I'm so damn long-winded.\n \n \n \n\n Peace.\n\n \n To you too.",

   "ApathySam,\n \n You are not frustrating me. I do think you have a slanted biblical interpretation though. One cannot take the verse in isolation but must look at the larger picture and continuity of the entire revelation of scripture and Christian history. Consider this verse, \"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother, cling to his bride, and the two shall become one flesh. This is a profound mystery, and it refers to Christ and the Church\" (Eph 5:31, 32). What an intimate way to describe Christ's union with the Church! Christ gave himself FULLY and TOTALLY to his Church unto death. But Christ gave us LIFE. The verse tells us that Christ is joined to the Church in a way that man is joined to woman. Do you realize the importance of this? The marital union is a cornerstone of theology. This is part of the reason for Christian opposition to gay \"marriage.\"\n \n Think back in scripture to Genesis when it is described that two become one flesh. There is a dual meaning. Man and woman become one flesh in the actual unitive physical act of making love and they become one flesh in the fruit of that love. The child that is the fruit of the marital act is a tangible embodiment of their love for eternity. The minute one attempts to distort this in some form or fashion then he is in God's domain (contraception, homosexuality, etc.). \n \n The marital act is prophetic in the sense that it speaks love that is to come in the form of a new unique individual. The marital union is symbol of God itself by its very structure and nature. God and Jesus loved one another so much that this love was made tangible in the form of the Holy Spirit. The love of man and woman model this. The family is a reflection of the Trinity.\n \n God's nature is that of a gift-giver, \"Our Father.\" Look at the design of your body (assuming you are male). It is designed to give the gift of life. A woman's body by its physical design is to receive that gift. The man and woman are complementary. Thus we are created in the image of God. The Church is not chauvinistic, it is truthful. The Church does not address all of the issues of sex and gender because of an attempt at protecting patriarchy. The Church strongly defends marriage and condemns premarital sex, contraception, in vitro fertilization, homosexuality, masturbation, abortion, etc. because these things betray the nature of God. All of these things are related to the Theology of the Body that is evidenced in our physicality and nature and voiced in scripture. \n \n The above writing is actually a paraphrasing of things I learned from a talk by Christopher West and others along with some of my own limited insight. If you are sincerely discerning whether homosexuality is against God then look at this website for starters \n \n http://www.ccli.org/marriage/west.shtml \n \n There is an introduction to John Paul II's Theology of the Body written by Christopher West there.\n \n Then try to get a copy of The Theology of the Body Explained  by Mr. West. The Theology of the Body is a profound work by Pope John Paul II. I have only had a brief introduction to it through a few of Mr. West's talks but it influenced me greatly. (If you are interested and more in tune to listening/audio then I can send you a private message and tell you where to get the tapes of the talks that I heard. It is a concise summary in an easy to understand format).\n \n You may also want to check out the Catechism of the Catholic Church's teaching on marriage to more fully understand what I am saying above. Click this link: Unitive and Procreative Aspect of Marriage \n \n To learn the official teaching of the Catholic Church on homosexuality then click here: Catholic Catechism on Homosexuality You may find the teaching surprising. Note the admissions on the pyschological genesis remaining unexplained, the fact that it is a trial, the numbers of homosexuals. Note the distinction of \"homosexual acts\" and the teaching on how homosexuals should be treated. The Church is neither a homophobe nor a persecutor. It is a conveyor of the truth evident in the scripture and tradition of revelation.",

   "Hello maximus,\n \n I do understand and have heard that love between two people is more than just earthly, that it glorifies God. However, I'm not sure I agree that the sole purpose of the physical act of sex is the fruit of children. It seems that most of the metaphor you presented involves the child, ie. the family representing the Trinity, man and woman becoming one flesh through their child, etc. \n \n Much of my understanding of Catholicism comes from what I've heard or from brief conversations with them. I'd heard the official stance is against contraception, but does that tend to vary from person to person in practice? (I'm not leading to a point with this; it's purely to satisfy my curiosity.)\n \n Regardless, though, I don't see why it isn't biblically sound to say that love between two people* glorifies God, and leave it at that. That is, the child isn't the only reason to ever have sex, but that it's certainly an extremely worthy one and something every couple should probably get around to at some point. I do think it's saying too much to say that sex just to profess one's love --without the intent of bearing a child -- is wrong. Not meaningless sex, but sex as an act of love.\n \n *I'm sure you noticed I changed \"love between a man and a woman\" to \"love between two people\". If the act of bearing children, while a blessing from God, is not a requirement for sex, then it seems the specifics of the genders of those having sex lose their importance. If true love is all it takes to glorify God, then I don't see it mattering between whom that true love exists.\n \n I'm reading through those links; thanks for posting them.\n \n Take care.",

   "maximus,\n \n I apologize for misunderstanding your post. After re-reading the Catechism on the section of Unitive and Procreative, I have a few questions:\n \n I couldn't figure out if it was saying that the fruit of a marriage was the act of raising a child or the act of actually giving birth to one. The text seemed to allude to both.\n \n If it was important only to raise a child, would adoption be an acceptable alternative? Since the only difference between a family with an adopted child and one that gave birth to its child is just the biological ties, would the will of God still be fulfilled? Obviously I'm asking with regard to a homosexual couple adopting, but what about a husband and wife who for whatever biological/health reasons couldn't produce children? I'm not suggesting that an infertile couple that adopts is in any way violating God's laws, but I am asking if that would be the same thing as a biological family in the eyes of the Catholic Church.\n \n For that matter, if it is important that the child be the biological offspring of a couple, would an infertile couple be allowed to have sex? It is this line in particular that concerns me:\n \n \n\n \"Every action which, whether in anticipation of the conjugal act, or in its accomplishment, or in the development of its natural consequences, proposes, whether as an end or as a means, to render procreation impossible\" is intrinsically evil.\n \n\n \n Was that just in reference to contraception, since that is an act that knowingly prevents a possible pregancy (compared to infertile couples or homosexuals, for whom sex doesn't prevent pregancy, but cannot ever yield a child)?",

Obviously I'm asking with regard to a homosexual couple adopting, but what about a husband and wife who for whatever biological/health reasons couldn't produce children? \n \n \n Sam, \n I believe it is both. Adoption is an acceptable alternative. Homosexual adoption would not be an alternative from the Catholic Christian viewpoint. A household headed by a homosexual couple does not fit the model of a Christian household as put forth in the revelation of sacred scripture and sacred tradition. I discussed the basis for this in my earlier post.\n \n \nwould an infertile couple be allowed to have sex? \n \n \n Yes, they are utilizing the unitive aspect of sex without intentionally disrupting the procreative aspect. Who's to say they may not someday get pregnant. Medical science is definitely not 100% in this matter.\n \n \nWas that just in reference to contraception, since that is an act that knowingly prevents a possible pregancy (compared to infertile couples or homosexuals, for whom sex doesn't prevent pregancy, but cannot ever yield a child\n \n \n It is not about the ability to yield a child. One cannot compare an infertile couple with a homosexual couple. The male and female are complementary though infertile. The male and female do not intentionally take part in actions to willfully prohibit God's role in creating children.They suffer from a medical problem out of their control that prevents fulfilling the procreative component of the union. The very nature of the homosexual union is contraceptive. The homosexual couple willfully takes part in sexual actions that eliminate procreation as a possibility.\n \n This does not apply solely to contraception (no procreative aspect). It applies to homosexual sex (no procreative aspect), masturbation (no unitive or procreative aspect), in vitro fertilization (no unitive aspect), oral sex that is used as the sexual act rather than as an anticipation to the act (no procreative aspect), anal sex within marriage (no procreative aspect).\n \n I just noticed your icon.

   "Much of my understanding of Catholicism comes from what I've heard or from brief conversations with them. I'd heard the official stance is against contraception, but does that tend to vary from person to person in practice? (I'm not leading to a point with this; it's purely to satisfy my curiosity.)\n \n \n Catholic acceptance of contraception varies. This does not speak to the requirement  of a Catholic to avoid contraception. The Catholic Church is not a democracy. The Catholic Church teaches that contraception is intrinsically evil. A Catholic who tells you that contraception is okay: 1. does not know the faith 2. willfully subverts the truth 3. refuses to submit to the truth. A Catholic using contraception is guilty of sin if he uses it aware of the full teaching of the Church. He should \"confess his sins, do penance, and amend his way of life.\"\n \n Contraception has wide reaching consequences that are not solely in the marital realm. Read Humanae Vitae by Pope Paul VI. It can be found on the web. Pope Paul VI made some very interesting predictions in the 1960s on four main problems that would arise if contraception was accepted. Read the exact predictions below and see if you think they have come true.\n \n 1. \"Conjugal infidelity and the general lowering of morality\"-the rate of adultery, abortion, divorce, the breakdown of families, wife and child abuse, venereal disease, and out of wedlock births have all significantly increased since the 1960s (contraception is not the only cause but probably a major contributor)\n \n 2. He warned that man would lose respect for woman and \"no longer [care] for her physical and psychological equilibrium.\" Man would consider her \"as a mere instrument of selfish enjoyment, and no longer as his respected and beloved companion.\"-widespread acceptance of pornography, sex no longer looked on as a sacred act reserved for marriage\n \n 3. A \"dangerous weapon\" would be placed \"in the hands of those public authorities who take no heed of moral exigencies.\"-consider China, consider the immense offensive of Planned Parenthood in 3rd world countries marketed as \"reproductive or women's health\" and the questionable practices of the United Nations\n \n 4. Contraception would mislead human beings into thinking they had unlimited dominion over their own bodies-this is now used as justification for abortion, \"my body,\" fertility treated as an infection for which a pill is needed and extrapolated from this the idea that an embryo can likewise be treated as an infection to be eradicated; and now cloning, genetic manipulation for immoral purposes\n \n \nRegardless, though, I don't see why it isn't biblically sound to say that love between two people* glorifies God, and leave it at that... Not meaningless sex, but sex as an act of love.\n \n \n It is not biblically sound because it contradicts biblical teaching against homosexuality. It is an attempt to call what is evil, good. It is putting emotion before the truth. Lawful, naturally ordered love between two people DOES glorify God. There are examples when love between two people, even if consentual, does not glorify God. An abused wife may say that she loves her husband. A pedophile and his young mate may profess love without realizing the destruction of childhood innocence and the impending emotional turmoil. Many men cheating on their wives (and cheating on their children) say they love her (and them) or may say they love their mistress. Maybe these situations are not properly termed love.\n \n \n \nAs for Leviticus, I don't really have a response to that. However, it's been my experience that many Christians don't even bother quoting Leviticus. I'm sure you know of the \"fulfilling the old covenant\" argument, and both it's sides. I figure if they're not worried about Leviticus, I shouldn't be.\n \n \n Not all of the Old Testament can be thrown out. Yes, the Old Testament was fulfilled in the Living Word who was Jesus. But as St. Augustine stated, \"The Old Testament is the New concealed. The New Testament is the Old revealed.\" (paraphrased). There are elements of truth in the Old Testament but they must be interpreted in the light of the truth of the New Testament.",

A household headed by a homosexual couple does not fit the model of a Christian household as put forth in the revelation of sacred scripture and sacred tradition. I discussed the basis for this in my earlier post.\n\n \n But much of the basis for this had to do with the family and lack of a procreative aspect of homosexual sex. Regardless of whether or not gay sex is contraceptive in nature (I'll get to that in a second), it is unitive and adoption is possible. Both elements can be satisfied -- as long as the Church allows for homosexual adoption. But the Church does not allow for the satisfaction of the procreative \"alternative\" that is acceptable for infertile couples. I'm assuming, then, that the reason for this is the scriptural reference in Footnote 141.\n \n Romans 1:24-27\n Im still unconvinced that Paul, in a long discussion about the evils of idolatry, suddenly breaks away from his topic to insert a sidenote about homosexuality, and then returns to the subject at hand. When verses 24-27 are put back into the context of Romans 1, they do suddenly seem to fit more with idolatry than with homosexuality. I understand that there's a possibility I have a slanted view of the Bible. I certainly understand that I have a vested interest in one interpretation over another. But I haven't yet heard a satisfactory explanation for this sudden divergence for three verses. It simply makes more sense that Paul would devote this section to one main topic and not stray.\n \n 1 Corinthians 6:9-10\n I mentioned the translational difference earlier. This actually worries me a bit. The NKJV says \"catamites,\" the NIV says \"homosexuals\". Two words that mean completely different things, somehow in a Bible that propheses it's own immunity to mistranslation. (At least as I've understood it. Note the difference between mistranslation, on a biblical scale, and misinterpretation, which is on an individual scale).\n \n 1 Timothy 1:10 and Genesis 19\n Timothy says \"sodomites.\" I've read a million different interpretations of that word, all based on history and ancient Greek and all that jazz, but I'm undecided on it. The story of Sodom, though, is kind of confusing. Two angels are invited into Lot's house. All the townsmen gather around the house and demand that they be allowed to \"know carnally\" these two men. Lot says, \"Do nothing unto these men, since this is the reason they came under the shadow of my roof.\" As an alternative, he offers his two virgin daughters to the men. The men of Sodom refuse and try to grab Lot, the angels pull him back into the house, the good people flee the city, and God destroys Sodom.\n \n So people interpret this passage to mean homosexuality is wrong. This is a conclusion I don't understand. There are some interpretations out there that say the crime of Sodom is inhospitality. I don't know if I agree with that, although it does fit with Lot's statement -- he feels he has a duty to protect the angels because they are under his roof. Well, let's assume that's wrong, though. Wouldn't the crime more obviously be an attempted group-rape of two men? How is that identical to homosexuality as it exists today? Lot presumably offered his daughter -- more or less considered property, right? -- but the angels were men, and it was of course unheard of to \"offer men\".\n \n I don't know. It seems that if someone interprets Genesis 19 to say homosexuality is wrong, then they can also interpret it to mean it's better for your daughters to be raped than to engage in homosexuality. Either interpretation seems far-fetched at best and ludicrous at worst.\n \n  Leviticus \n I notice Leviticus isn't mentioned in Footnote 141.\n \n \n \n\n The male and female do not intentionally take part in actions to willfully prohibit God's role in creating children.They suffer from a medical problem out of their control that prevents fulfilling the procreative component of the union. The very nature of the homosexual union is contraceptive. The homosexual couple willfully takes part in sexual actions that eliminate procreation as a possibility.\n \n\n \n I disagree. An infertile couple having sex and a homosexual couple having sex are both only satisfying the unitive aspect. The infertile couple is certainly not preventing procreation, since it is an impossibility for them. But isn't it also an impossibility for the homosexual couple? For both couples, it's not necessarily the individual that \"eliminates\" procreation, it is the combination of the two people. While either the woman is barren or the man is sterile, presumably the other partner could procreate if he/she had sex with someone else. Either way, sex for either couple will have the same end result.\n \n Additionally, this idea seems to be based on an assumption that one could walk away from homosexuality if one desires. Yet the Church itself said the origins of homosexuality were unknown. More importantly, it says that \"all homosexuals are called to celibacy\". If homosexual sex truly prevented the possibility of pregnancy, that would mean the homosexuals in question have the power to impregnate someone they love, and they simply choose not to. And if that were the case, they wouldn't be called to celibacy, they would be called to a conversion to heterosexuality.\n \n Since the Church admits the possibility of homosexuality not being a choice (and, speaking from experience, this is hardly a question for me), then homosexuals, like infertile couples, \"suffer from a medical problem out of their control that prevents fulfilling the procreative component of the union.\" Certainly they can't be expected to fall in love with someone for whom such feelings are impossible (and the Church seems to acknowledge this by calling them to celibacy). That leaves infertile couples and homosexual couples in the same boat: there is ONLY the possibility of satisfying the unitive aspect, and neither couple is truly PREVENTING the procreative aspect. Yet infertile couples are given the option to satisfy that aspect through the alternative means of adoption, and homosexual couples are not.\n \n So if that is based only on Scripture, then we seem to be deadlocked. Whee!\n \n In contrast, oral and anal sex within marriage, masturbation, and in vitro fertilization all PREVENT either the unitive or proreative aspect.\n \n \n\n Pope Paul VI made some very interesting predictions in the 1960s on four main problems that would arise if contraception was accepted. Read the exact predictions below and see if you think they have come true.\n \n\n \n At least with the first two predictions, I'm not sure one can reasonably link the use of contraceptives to the social trends listed. I could just as easily make similar predictions about the future in 30-40 years, and decide illiteracy is to blame.\n \n The fourth prediction is interesting, though. I could definitely see the connection between contraception and the \"day-after\" pill, which is of course easily linked to abortion. Maybe the cause and effect relationship is more subtle for the first two, but I tend to think that current social trends have much less to do with contraception than with plenty of other factors.\n \n \n \n\n I just noticed your icon. I must tell you that I find it a bit suspicious. Do you support the rebellion or the empire? And don't try any jedi mind tricks because I am ready for them. Catholics are resistant to that kind of stuff.\n\n \n The rebellion, of course. The Deathstar serves as an amusing reminder of imperial incompetence. Who makes a planet-sized ship with an accessible weakness that can destroy the whole thing? Tsk, tsk. You really should get some better engineers.\n \n And I wouldn't be so sure about Catholics being resistant to Jedi mind tricks. Just wait until we secure the appointment of Ringo Starr as the next Pope. \n \n Mmmmwaaa ha ha ha...",

I'm assuming, then, that the reason for this is the scriptural reference in Footnote 141.\n An infertile couple having sex and a homosexual couple having sex are both only satisfying the unitive aspect. The infertile couple is certainly not preventing procreation, since it is an impossibility for them. But isn't it also an impossibility for the homosexual couple? For both couples, it's not necessarily the individual that \"eliminates\" procreation, it is the combination of the two people. While either the woman is barren or the man is sterile, presumably the other partner could procreate if he/she had sex with someone else. Either way, sex for either couple will have the same end result.\n Additionally, this idea seems to be based on an assumption that one could walk away from homosexuality if one desires. Yet the Church itself said the origins of homosexuality were unknown. More importantly, it says that \"all homosexuals are called to celibacy\". If homosexual sex truly prevented the possibility of pregnancy, that would mean the homosexuals in question have the power to impregnate someone they love, and they simply choose not to. And if that were the case, they wouldn't be called to celibacy, they would be called to a conversion to heterosexuality.\n Since the Church admits the possibility of homosexuality not being a choice (and, speaking from experience, this is hardly a question for me), then homosexuals, like infertile couples, \"suffer from a medical problem out of their control that prevents fulfilling the procreative component of the union.\" Certainly they can't be expected to fall in love with someone for whom such feelings are impossible (and the Church seems to acknowledge this by calling them to celibacy). That leaves infertile couples and homosexual couples in the same boat: there is ONLY the possibility of satisfying the unitive aspect, and neither couple is truly PREVENTING the procreative aspect. Yet infertile couples are given the option to satisfy that aspect through the alternative means of adoption, and homosexual couples are not.\n \n \n For clarification, adoption does not satisfy the procreative aspect of sex. Adoption is something separate from the marital act. It is an act of Christian charity. It allows the formation of a family. The prohibition against a homosexual couple adopting does not deal with licit components of sex but rather with the Christian model of a family. \n \n You state that homosexual couples and infertile heterosexual couples are similar in their sexual relations. This is not so. A homosexual couple can neither satisfy the procreative aspect of marriage nor the unitive aspect of marriage. In fact, they cannot satisfy any aspect of marriage. There is no approved unitive aspect of a sexual relationship outside the bonds of marriage. The unitive aspect of homosexual sex is unlawful. It goes against the laws of marriage and nature and cannot be unitive within the framework of Christian love. Homosexual sex is adulterous because there is no recognition of homosexual marriage in the eyes of God. As I said earlier, one can see God's plan for man and woman being the valid communion of two persons. Genesis 1, \"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. And God blessed them, and God said to them, \"Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it...Therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and cleaves to his wife, and they become one flesh.\" Then notice that Paul references this passage in Ephesians 5 when he speaks of the union of Christ and the Church. If we do not live the complementarity of the sexes correctly then we will not live the complementarity of man and God correctly.\n \n Men and women were created for each other. You cannot say that an infertile heterosexual couple is the same as a homosexual couple. Having heterosexual sex without resultant fruit is different than having homosexual sex that we know can never yield fruit. Homosexual sex is inherently barren, heterosexual sex is abnormally barren. Heterosexual sex is like plugging an electrical cord in a socket. Sometimes it doesn't work but the cord was made for the socket. It's in the right place but there may be other problems occurring. But if I go stick my cord into a phone jack I know before hand that I will not get electricity. The two were not made for each other. The two do not complement one another. The two can never yield fruit. Therefore the two can never be a reflection of the life-giving love of God. Furthermore, a heterosexual couple that is infertile often doesn't know this at the time of marriage. Homosexual couples, however, know from the beginning that their love will not be life-giving.\n \n It is not just about the end-infertility or fertility. It is also about the means to the end. The means can be unlawful and the end can be unlawful. Contraception, sterilization, homosexual acts, masturbation, etc. are unlawful means to the unlawful end of willful infertility. Heterosexual sex is a lawful means to the unwanted end of uncontrollable infertility. \n \n Whether homosexuality would be considered a medical problem is debatable. It could be a result of socialization, family dynamics, or other reasons. It could be a cross to carry. Crosses are not very easily explained. All we can say is that they unite us more deeply with the sufferings of Christ and give us a part in his suffering on the Cross. \n \n In regard to celibacy, those who are single are also called to this same chastity. It is not based on whether you do or do not have the choice to have homosexual inclinations. Does the Church allow a single person to have sex with someone when he cannot find a life-long mate? This may not be that person's choice. He may really want to be married and/or have sex. He must control his heterosexual tendencies. He must remain chaste until sex can be had within the lawful bounds of marriage. Those with homosexual inclinations have the choice to abstain from homosexual sex just as a person who is heterosexual can willfully abstain. They must give themselves to the greater good-a true love of God. \n \n peace.",

   "ApathySam,\n I wanted you to know that I did see your last response before it was erased. I actually copied it into Microsoft Word in order to respond when I had time. I am reposting it here so others can read it and so I will be able to respond in due time.\n \n Originally posted by maximus:\n \n \nHave you entertained the idea that homosexuality is a form of idolatry? Putting one's desires before the will and law of God? Can you show me anywhere in scripture where homosexuality is spoken of in a favorable way? (1 am attempting to do more research on the scriptural aspects of our debate).\n\n \n Reply by Apathy Sam:\n I admit that's an interesting idea, but it makes some circular assumptions. We're debating whether or not Romans 1 condemns homosexuality. You're suggesting that it does because it classifies homosexuality as idolatry. But in order for that to be true, the statement \"Putting one's desires before the will and law of God\" would have to be true. And for that to be true, God, through the Bible, must condemn homosexuality. That's like saying Romans 1 condemns homosexuality because Romans 1 condemns homosexuality.\n \n Unless, of course, the \"will and law of God\" you're referring to was found in other passages. So that would mean Romans 1 could only condemn homosexuality if the other passages did. I still maintain that Tim. 6:9 is vague at best -- it only condemns homosexuality if you're reading a certain version. I also don't understand the rules governing which Levitical laws people are still meant to follow. There are many in the same section that homosexuality is mentioned that are clearly irrelevant now as the old covenant was fulfilled. And then Corinthians is just a reference to Sodom, which I'll get to in a second.\n \n Originally posted by maximus:\n \n \nI did not know that the Bible made the claim of being immune to mistranslation.\n\n \n Reply by ApathySam:\n I'm going to check about this one. The two people I regularly talk with about the Bible and Christianity in general, both very knowledgable and religious Christians, believe that the Bible is infallible. Shoot, one of them gave me some passages on it, but I've lost them. Anyway, I'm not sure if this is a Catholic-Protestant discrepancy, or just an area that allows some flexibility with personal belief, but I'll get back to you on this point.\n \n Originally posted maximus:\n \nI am glad that you are hesitant to accept that explanation. We can be sure that the crime was not inhospitality if we read Jude 1:7 that makes reference to Sodom.\n\n \n Reply by ApathySam:\n Good point, but Jude 1:7 describes the sin as that of \"sexual immorality\" because of a lust for \"strange flesh\". Assume a different scenario for a moment: that Lot insteac gave shelter to two women, and the men of the town still surrounded the house and demanded to have their way with the women instead. Couldn't their sin still be described with the same words?\n \n Originally posted by maximus:\n \nYou state that homosexual couples and infertile heterosexual couples are similar in their sexual relations. This is not so. A homosexual couple can neither satisfy the procreative aspect of marriage nor the unitive aspect of marriage. In fact, they cannot satisfy any aspect of marriage. There is no approved unitive aspect of a sexual relationship outside the bonds of marriage. The unitive aspect of homosexual sex is unlawful. It goes against the laws of marriage and nature and cannot be unitive within the framework of Christian love.\n\n \n Reply by ApathySam:\n Homosexuals cannot satisfy any aspect of marriage because they're not allowed to marry. If homosexual sex is wrong because sex outside of marriage is wrong, that's a case for allowing homosexual marriages.\n \n But you say that \"there is no recognition of homosexual marriage in the eyes of God.\" This is supposedly because of a combination of Scripture and the theology of the family. That's what I meant when I said we seem to be deadlocked. We've come to a point where we're starting to repeat our earlier arguments. I still have the same opinions on the scriptural passages. It still seems as if the idea of a model Christian family is based on those passages, which means everything is still boiling down, in my eyes, to the Bible.\n \n I can understand that man and women are quite complimentary! and I can understand that God obviously meant for the two to go together. What I don't understand is how this implies that anything different is necessarily wrong.\n \n As for the infertile couple.. What if there's a 100% assurance that they could never get pregnant? What if the woman had ovarian cancer and needed her ovaries removed? There are plenty of cases where an infertile couple is absolutely not like sticking a plug into a wall socket. If you KNOW there's no electricity! there's no difference between doing that and sticking into a phone jack.\n \n Originally posted by maximus:\n \nWhether homosexuality would be considered a medical problem is debatable. It could be a result of socialization! family dynamics, or other reasons. It could be a cross to carry. Crosses are not very easily explained. All we can say is that they unite us more deeply with the sufferings of Christ and give us a part in his suffering on the Cross.\n\n \n Reply by ApathySam:\n But if it is a medical problem, then there's a huge similarity between homosexuals and infertile couples.

Lying can be done, and then you can be forgiven by repentance. If you are a homosexual however, the chances are that you are going to die a homosexual. Murder again, a sin that you can commit, and later repent and ask for forgiveness.

Although the Bible leans to this in some ways, (Romans 3:28) I would think that it is a combination of God's grace and faith. Sola Fide has some apparent dangers. Many people get mixed up and think that \"they can save themselves\" because they have faith. \n \n What do you make of James 2:24?\n \n \"You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone.\"\n \n At the Final Judgment, as we read in John 6 and Revelation 20, men will be separated: sheep vs. goats, those who did \"good works\" vs. those who did not. \n \n I'm not disputing sola fide, just giving my thoughts.

Seriously, God doesn't play favorites with sin. Lying is just as bad as murder. And I'm putting my money that a ton of liars are in heaven. And murderers for that matter. In fact. Heaven is FULL of sinners. Why? Because of grace. \n \n \n I have a few points of consideration concerning the segment above:\n \n 1. If homosexual action is a sin (we have an ongoing debate on this thread concerning that including the interpretation of scripture that seems to condemn it) then it is not necessarily a single sin that puts the person in jeopardy. It is the persistence in sin without seeking repentance and the seperation of oneself from God with this persistence in sin.\n \n 2. There is a difference in sin. Read 1 John 5:16-17  that distinguishes between mortal and venial sin. Then read John 19:11  where Jesus says, \"therefore he who delivered me to you has the greater sin.\"\n \n 3. Heaven is not full of sinners. Revelation 21:27  says that \"nothing unclean shall enter heaven.\" Paul says in 1 Cor 3:15  that a man's work will be purified during the Judgment.\n \n \nAnd the best part about it, is that there's only one admission requirement into eternity - trusting in grace.\n\n \n Now, I agree with you Chancellor that grace is free and unmerited. This is not the only requirement for reaching heaven however. I echo dreamweaver's sentiments that one must cooperate with the grace God has given us by using the free will that he has also given us. Along with James I ask you to consider these verses: Hebrews 10: 26-30. Those who accept God's grace can fall away. There are many other verses besides this one that refute eternal security.",

   "Dreamweaver -\n \n I'm interested in your argument claiming that because homosexuals often die homosexuals, that its a different type of sin. I believe you are alluding to the theory that homosexuality is a lifestyle, instead of a singular act of sin... So if homosexuality IS a sin (or a sinful lifestyle), that homosexuals can't go to heaven because they don't repent before they die (where as murderers can repent before they die).\n \n First of all, I'd like to ask the biblical support for this theory (that you have to repent of every sin before you die.) Say you die immeadiately after killing someone and don't have to repent of that individual sin. Are you going to heaven? \n \n My argument still holds that whether or not homosexuality is a sin, homosexuals can still be Christians. Grace isn't conditional. I can understand the point that if homosexuality IS a sin, that Christian homosexuals would have less crowns in heaven. But being a sinner (or not repenting for every sin before you die) doesn't exclude you from entering the Kingdom of Heaven. \n \n To your thoughts on Sola Fid(e): We both agree that Sola Fid(e) is the theory of faith alone (in Christ alone). I completely agree that salvation IS based on faith. The biblical support of this theory is everywhere. And I know I can't save myself. Nobody can. Jesus Christ is the only way to Heaven. Therefore, salvation is based solely on faith in His act of grace. \n \n Now to one of my favorite Biblical debates... faith without works. According to both Paul and James, faith is defined as a living, active, productive trust in Christ. I firmly believe this. Genuine Faith produces good works and is something you live by daily. Jesus Christ isn't a get out of jail free card that you can just pick up by saying a creed. I WILL say that we are NOT saved by works at all though. \n \n Anticipating your reply that homosexuality is a sin, and therefore if you are living in sin, you aren't in fellowship with Christ - EVERYONE has a sin problem. Everyone has an area in which they spiritually struggle. Regardless of whether homosexuality is a sin (and that's a totally separate debate,) all believers constantly struggle with sin. This doesn't bar them entrance to heaven though. How could it? Jesus' death would mean nothing then. But He has paid the price in full. And once you have that faith in Christ, you've been set free.\n \n Jesus quotes in John 8:36 that if the Son has set you free, you are free indeed. Its done. It is finished. Jesus has conquered sin. Anyone who believes receives this freedom. And whether or not they sin after that, or struggle with a lifestyle of sin is irrelevent. The verse doesn't say if the son is setting you free, than you shall be free indeed. \n \n Homosexuals can actively seek God just as easy as anyone else (including pathological liars, murderers, and adulterers.) Homosexuals can be Christians because they can have faith that Christ has paid the price in full for them just like anyone else. Whether or not they sin afterwards (and they will - whether its the \"sin\" of homosexuality or something else), is irrelevant if their faith is genuine.",

The way I interpet these verses is that that sin that leads to death - is plural, or a lifestyle of sin as you would say. Granted, homosexuality could be one of these areas. My honest question to you is what is the penalty of this sin? From what I've read by Charles C. Ryrie, it leads to physical death. But wouldn't Christ's death on the cross cover this sin as well?\n \n In response to your reply on heaven is full of sinners, lol, I laughed when I read what you wrote. I'd readily agree with you that heaven is full of saints, not sinners. Excuse the technicality (even though it is a pretty important one).\n \n Thanks for your thoughts and the verses.\n \n I'm interested in hearing more.\n \n Chris",

   "Okay, there is a difference. I think it is safe to say that Homosexuality is a sin. There are plenty of references of this in The Bible. What do you make of these?\n \n Okay, let us say now that it is a sin. By being homosexual are they not still sinning? A murderer sins. However, if he truly repents, he will not go on murdering. The same can be applied to the homosexual. Okay, this thread is quite alike to the one I just posted, so here's a copy and paste.\n \n (Romans 5:1) - \"Therefore having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.\" \n \n (Ephesians 2:8-9) - \"For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; 9not as a result of works, that no one should boast.\" \n \n \"You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone,\" (James 2:24)\n \n It proves that faith is required. \n \n Okay, time for some theology.\n \n It is a fundamental Christian belief that we are justified by faith. By justified we mean \"God declares the sinner to be righteous\". Lets take James's verse for example:\n \n James is simply saying that if you 'say' you are a Christian, then there should be some appropriate works manifested or your faith is false. This is also seen in 1 John 2:4.\n \n \"If you say you have come to know Him, yet you do not keep His commandments, then the truth is not in you and you are a liar.\" \n \n I haven't once claimed that all you need is faith. The Bible teaches that Faith, Love and Hope must all go together. (1 Corinthians 13:13) This is why I think that sola fide is a bit 'shaky' . It may lead people to falsely believe that , however they live their lives, their salvation is assured on the basis of one pledge at an emotion-filled meeting. Plus, faith alone is not scriptural. All Christians would agree that works alone are not enough to save us, but they are necessary to salvation, as an outworking of Faith.\n \n What The Bible teaches is this:\n \n It is not merely enough to say you believe in Jesus. You must actually believe and trust in Him. If you actually do, then you will demonstrate that faith by a changed and godly life. If not, then your profession is of no more value than the same profession of demons: \"We believe Jesus lived.\" \n \n God does not want a faith that is empty and hypocritical. True faith results in true works. Therefore, we are justified by faith. That is, we are made righteous in the eyes of God by faith as is amply demonstrated by Romans. However, that faith, if it is true, will result in deeds appropriate to salvation. Which brings me back to what God said in Eph. 2:8-10, \n \n \"For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, that no one should boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.\" \n \n *****\n \n Maximus said pretty much exactly what I wanted to say, just better.",

But wouldn't Christ's death on the cross cover this sin as well?\n\n \n I do not think that a sin must be a repeated, high quantity sin to qualify as a mortal sin. I believe that the gravity/seriousness of the sin determines whether it is mortal. Murder would be more serious than calling someone a bad name. Rape would have more gravity than pinching someone's butt. Stealing a baby might be more serious than stealing a toy, etc. (I also believe however that there is a consequence from failure to repent of a sin/repeating a sin. Forgiveness cannot be obtained without repentance.)\n \n John is speaking may be speaking of earthly death but more importantly he is speaking of the death of the soul...the forfeit of heaven...spiritual death in addition to physical death. Notice the first sentence of the paragraph, \"I write this to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life.\" I believe that he is speaking in the context of eternal not earthly life. Remember the scripture passage that the \"wages of sin is death.\" If you are meaning that the sin of homosexuality would have physical manifestations that might affect the health of the individual leading to physical death then I am not sure that John was speaking in this context. Death did enter into the world due to sin. Mortal sin puts one's soul at risk of forfeiting eternal  life. It can kill the soul so to speak. (James seems to speak of physical and spiritual sickness and death in James 5:13-18)\n \n Look at this link for further elucidation: \n \n Mortal and Venial Sin \n \n Do you believe that once one makes a profession of faith that he has eternal security--assurance of salvation?

   "A simple DNA test will reveal either, XX or XY. With that information a doctor aproches the parents with a course of action that will give the child the best chance of living a normal life.\n\n \n Actually that is incorrect. First, because some intersexual variances are caused by the DNA structure itself, and present as XXY or XYY etc. Second, in many hospitals the policy remains telling the parents as little as possible, so some parents don't actually find out whether their child has a dangerous condition or simply intersexual genitals. Further, when the child grows up and reaches puberty, they are often given hormones that will unnaturally induce the physical characteristics of the sex/gender assigned by the doctor. Also, many of the surguries performed on these infants are purely cosmetic, and can actually cause medical problems. Of course, some types of intersexuality require surgical intervention of some kind, such as if someone has a functional uterus but a closed vaginal canal. Aside from these cases, the surguries performed on these infants are unnecessary and dangerous.\n \n As it happens, I was hired to translate a publication designed to educate health practitioners on intersexuality, so I have had access to the most recent and accurate information on the subject.

   "No problem. Now that you have come to terms with it, will you respond?\n\n \n Mizmaxx,\n \n Forgive me for not responding more thoroughly to your profound nose-picking statement. Let me give it a try.\n \n \nYou stated that penis in vagina is sacred because it has the potential to create life, unlike nose-picking which can only withdraw boogers. I retorted that it is not penis in vagina that has the potential to create life, but sperm and egg. \n \n \n I did not say that penis in vagina is sacred because it has the potential to produce life. I simply stated that nose picking is not divine because it does not have the potential to create life.\n \n \"Penis in vagina\" is \"sacred\" (to use your terms) according to the teaching of the Church because it has a unitive purpose that cannot be deleted from the sexual act. The other part of that act is a procreative purpose--the creation of life in partnership with God. \n \n Here's what I originally wrote:\n \n God's nature is that of a gift-giver, \"Our Father.\" Look at the design of your body (assuming you are male). It is designed to give the gift of life. A woman's body by its physical design is to receive that gift. The man and woman are complementary. Thus we are created in the image of God. The Church is not chauvinistic, it is truthful. The Church does not address all of the issues of sex and gender because of an attempt at protecting patriarchy. The Church strongly defends marriage and condemns premarital sex, contraception, in vitro fertilization, homosexuality, masturbation, abortion, etc. because these things betray the nature of God. All of these things are related to the Theology of the Body that is evidenced in our physicality and nature and voiced in scripture.\n \n I was in a conversation with ApathySam concerning the Church's teaching on sex. More specifically, it was referring to John Paul II's Theology of the Body. This was done within a Christian context. My point was that it is evident in the design of the male and female body that the two are complementary in the sexual act. The male gives and the female recieves. \n \n \n(Penis in vagina) + (sperm and egg) = (potential to create life)\n \n (Penis in vagina) - (sperm and/or egg) = 0, no (potential to create life)\n \n (Sperm and egg) - (penis in vagina) = (potential to create life)\n \n Ergo, penis in vagina is not a variable of (potential to create life). Neither penis nor vagina has to exist at all, in fact. If a person was born with functioning ovaries and no vagina (which happens), or functioning testicles but no penis (which also happens), they could potentially create life, without ever having intercourse. Conversely, people with sex organs but non-functioning gametes would have absolutely zero chance of creating a fetus. One could be implanted into the uterus, but they could not make one.\n\n \n Now, the above examples may be true in modern times where technology assists us but you forget that this technology was not always available. Do you think that a male and female could have reproduced without a penis and vagina, say, in the year 500 B.C.? I don't think so. Intercourse was necessary. So the original, inherent design is evident. (complementarity is not evident for male and male or female and female or man with dog or woman with tiger) Male and female were created complementarily. They relied on one another for the propagation of the species. If there would have been no penis or vagina then we would not be here today. They were a necessity. So in a sense, penis and vagina do have the potential to create life as they are necessary in some instances. The comparison to nose-picking is not valid as nose-picking has an entirely different purpose and the complementarity of the two body parts participating is debatable.",

   "[QUOTE=mizmaxx]Actually that is incorrect. First, because some intersexual variances are caused by the DNA structure itself, and present as XXY or XYY etc. Second, in many hospitals the policy remains telling the parents as little as possible, so some parents don't actually find out whether their child has a dangerous condition or simply intersexual genitals. Further, when the child grows up and reaches puberty, they are often given hormones that will unnaturally induce the physical characteristics of the sex/gender assigned by the doctor. Also, many of the surguries performed on these infants are purely cosmetic, and can actually cause medical problems. Of course, some types of intersexuality require surgical intervention of some kind, such as if someone has a functional uterus but a closed vaginal canal. Aside from these cases, the surguries performed on these infants are unnecessary and dangerous.\n \n [QUOTE]\n \n The abnormality of XXY or XYY, is actually irrelevent to our discussion. The presence of the Y chromozone causes a testosterone rush at about 13 weeks. This action causes a great deal of brain damage to the embryo. This is what alows women to think and comunicate diffrently. They use bothsides of there brain constantly and consistantly to think and communicate. This testosterone also causes hormanal changes with in the embryo alowing the diffrent genitalia to develop. Therefore scientifically speaking any presence of the Y chromozone means a male is present genetically speaking. Psychologically speaking man doesn't need alot of persuading to sin. Homosexual men and women know with in them that they were not \"always this way\". At some time in there life they chose to follow this path. Sometimes it can be tracked to there childhood.

   "Hard to believe, but I actually read the article lappster linked to. Aside from being over twenty years old in facts and statistics, it was nothing new. This is all you can come up with as harm resulting from being XXXXX?\n \n \nHomosexuals can't have children. Few would dispute that children provide an opportunity to give and receive love in a way that meets a basic human need.\n\n \n Not true. Homosexuals can, and do have children. Heterosexual couples aren't necessarily fertile- that shouldnt' stop people from sharing love. \n \n \nHomosexual relationships lack complementarity.\n\n \n Once and for all, women and men aren't complementary. They are people, and when you pair them up sometimes it works, sometimes it don't. This essentialist bs that men and women are \"opposite sexes\" has never been proven despite the centuries of attempts to ram it down people's throats. \n \n \nHomosexual relationships, on average are much shorter lived than heterosexual relationships. A major study by the Kinsey Institute revealed that 78% of male homo- sexual \"affairs\" (relationships entered into with an intent of commitment) \n\n \n Using a study of short-term relationships to argue that all XXXXX relationships are short-term?\n \n \nIn a 1977 survey of members ofthe American Psychiatric Association, 73% of the psychiatrists responding said that they thought that homosexual men are less happy than others.\n\n this proves beyond a doubt that 73% of psychiatrists in 1977 were homophobic. So what?\n \n \nCertain common homosexual practices are physically destructive apart from transmission of disease.\n\n \n a) Same can be said for how dangerous/destructive heterosexual intercourse is.\n \n b) Heterosexual couples engage in these so-called \"destructive\" practices as well.\n \n c) Following this line of reasoning, all women should be lesbians, because that's the least risky form of sex.\n \n \nIn a survey reported in the official publication of the American Public Health Association, 78% of the gay respondents reported that they had been affected by a sexually transmitted disease at least one time.7 \n\n \n Without knowing het stats, this means nothing.\n \n \nOver 70% of those who have contracted AIDS are homosexual or bi-sexual. \n\n \n No longer accurate.\n \n Come on. You can do better than this. I'm asking you to give me something that shows that in and of itself, XXXXX lovin' is harmful. Like how if you kill someone, they die. If you love someone, they... are loved? If you desire them superficially or deeply and spiritually, and they feel the same way, and you aren't betraying your relationships with other people- what's the catastrophe about that?

Rather we are understanding that we are asked to live without sin. Just as the woman in the story you are quoting. Christians are allowed to judge Chrsitians, Just as Jesus examined the Fig tree without friut. Men who continue in their sins are without fruit. When one repents of sin he has taken the first step of salvation. This recognition of what sin is also leads one to despise that sin and turn away from it. Therefor a person who is activily homosexual is not yet a christian. I am not saying a christian can never sin. They are tempted just as other men and can fall into temptation. The premise behind this repentance is change of heart. The heart of the repentant person seeks reconciliation. The heart of the repentant person recognizes the pain of their sin to ther God and Father. The repentant person will not be in a habitual, flagerant sinful nature. He has a new nature.

Is pedophilia \"love?\"\n \n How about if a mother loves her son in a sexual relationship? Live and let live?\n\n \n I didn't say just sexual love alone.... I mean a complete relationship with that person of the same sex-emotion, sex, and all. And besides, you need consent of both parties. If a child if being \"loved\" by an adult, it's not really consentual. More than likely, it's the man convincing the boy that it's all right. Now, I wouldn't doubt that there were instances where there was true consent. I'd be skeptical, only due to the rampant priest/child-molestors and all, but nonetheless, I am not the ultimate ideal of truth. If there's true consent, unbeknownst to me or anyone else, I don't think it's wrong.\n \n \nHow about polygamy? Do you believe in monogamy?\n\n \n If all parties involved wish to participate and willingly accept the emotional/physical consequences of being with multiple \"wives\" or \"husbands\", then yeah, it's fine with me. But I prefer a monogamous relationship to devote myself to.... much easier, it is....\n \n \nHow about a woman and a chimp?\n\n \n A chimp can't really consent per se.... not to mention that there's no real hopes of having an emotional relationship with an animal. Now, if someone could demonstrate the chimp's consent, then it would be okay.... otherwise, it's just taking advantage of an animal sexually. Were it truly love, it'd be fine by me.\n \n \nI would bet that you believe in some taboos on love. Do any of these examples insult your ideas of decency?\n\n \n I find it funny that you compare a child-molesting and bestiality to homosexuality. Two mature people making a mutual choice versus man abusing child or man abusing animal. I feel sorry for you and your mind set. I hope you gain more scope in your future days.\n \n \nShould God accept all types of \"love?\" Do you?\n\n \n Yes. If it's truly love, and it's truly consentual....\n \n \nThe fact is that some \"loves\" are disordered--even when those doing the \"loving\" see nothing wrong with it.\n\n \n \"Love\" is only truly love when it's reciprocated. The pervert who stalks his dream girl and sexually harasses her may claim to love this girl, but if he truly loved her, he would respect her enough not to force himself upon her.\n \n When an adult makes a sexual choice for a child or an animal, he/she is not respecting that other being, for that being is either unaware of the choice being made for them, or would not make that choice unless someone was pressuring them to do so. There is no consent.\n \n This is why statutory rape exists; until you are mature enough to make sexual choices for yourself, even if both of the parties involved are physically capable of sexual activity, there is no true consent.\n \n Consent is the key. Honest, truthful, no-pressures-forced consent.\n \n Homosexuals are just like heterosexuals; they are sexually mature human-beings who want to express their sexuality in their own way. When you hear of a homosexual raping or forcing himself upon another, then you can complain about wrongdoing.",

People use that term to mean very different things. If you're talking about an abusive dynamic, I never agree with that. Abusive dynamics have to do with power, so that's not really relevant to homosexuality in general (abuse happens no matter what the gender of the partners).\n So, where there is no abusive dynamic, and the partners are consenting adults, but they are homosexual, you think you can say that they do not truly love each other and they should not be together?\n\n \n Incest is against the law of God, regardless of consent. That's the whole point. Just because an adult consents to do something doesn't make it right.\n \n Recently a German man (http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/s1005981.htm) took part in an act of cannibalism - his victim consented.

At once you're against me for having a dogged attachment to dogmatic morals, on the other you now suggest that your morals aren't simply made up by you, but also have been around for a while.

Yours come from lake spirits and wood nymphs which you believe forms a more rational belief system than mine\n :)\n \n \n \n By the way... do you onw a dog/cat? If 'yes' did it give its consent to be \n owned by you?\n \n IF you have kids, will you always consult them to get consent before making any decision that affects them? (even when they're babies?) Consent seems to be a big thing for you.\n \n And as for 'adult' consent; which will no doubt be your counter to the quip I just made about babies, what is an adult?

Sure, you can intervene.... make sure that the person is making the right choice, but ultimately, it's their choice. Abortion, likewise, is the choice of the woman.

   "Killacozzy,\n \nI didn't say just sexual love alone.... I mean a complete relationship with that person of the same sex-emotion, sex, and all. And besides, you need consent of both parties. If a child if being \"loved\" by an adult, it's not really consentual. More than likely, it's the man convincing the boy that it's all right. Now, I wouldn't doubt that there were instances where there was true consent. I'd be skeptical, only due to the rampant priest/child-molestors and all, but nonetheless, I am not the ultimate ideal of truth. If there's true consent, unbeknownst to me or anyone else, I don't think it's wrong.\n\n \n I'm not sure what you meant but here is what you wrote, \n \n \nBut how can Christians or anyone think that the mere act of loving someone of the same sex physically or emotionally is wrong?\n \n \n You wrote physically or emotionally. Also, if you will notice, I put the word love in quotes throughout my post.\n \n \nIf all parties involved wish to participate and willingly accept the emotional/physical consequences of being with multiple \"wives\" or \"husbands\", then yeah, it's fine with me. But I prefer a monogamous relationship to devote myself to.... much easier, it is....\n\n \n You believe there are unique emotional and physical consequences to certain types of relationships that are not present in monogamous ones?\n \n \nYes. If it's truly love, and it's truly consentual....\n\n \n Recently, I read an article about a Porn marketer who was arrested (I searched the net to find the article and I can't locate it yet). His films depicted rape scenes. They depicted violent sex scenes with the women being punched at times. If I'm not mistaken the man and his wife may have been in the films. Two mature adults, both giving consent. What is your opinion on this? Is it okay being that the conditions for consent and maturity are met? Or can certain sexual actions cause harm in the presence of maturity and consent?\n \n I'm also interested to hear your response to Montalban on the issue of incest. Do you believe that incest between two members of the same immediate family (brother/sister, mother/son, etc.) of the age of maturity, giving consent, would be okay?",

   "Do you believe that incest between two members of the same immediate family (brother/sister, mother/son, etc.) of the age of maturity, giving consent, would be okay?\n \n Would this be a harmful relationship?\n\n \n I don't really think that any incestual relationship of mature adults is actually consentual. Even in the animal kingdom, while creatures mate with close relatives (i.e. cousins), instinct discourages mother/son, father/daughter, and sibling pairings. Now, it does occasionally happen, and since I'm not fit to tell two thinking individuals that their actions are wrong, I would not object. I don't think I could do that, and because it's somewhat abnormal, I don't think I could be around those who participated in such a relationship openly, but hey, it's not me who's doin' the inbreeding. ;) \n \n Even in close inbreeding, the rate of harmful mutation, by the way, is nominal. In a recent Discover magazine, I read an article by a genetics expert who informed that the odds for genetic mutation in such cases are something like 3%.... consequently, the expert also noted that the odds for mutation are the same for children conceived by women over age 40. Is having a baby over age 40, too, a sin?\n \n \nAnd it is chilling that those who might defend an animal because he can't give consent in most cases would not defend the child in the womb against the violence he endures without his consent.\n\n \n I support the ideas of not raping small woodland creatures.... but I don't necessarily think it's wrong to abort an unborn fetus. Late-term abortions are ****ed up, but in the first trimester, when the child is really not a child so much as a child-in-the-making, it's up to the giver of this life, the mother. Since the mother has to deal with the consequences of the birth as much as the baby, she has the right to determine whether or not she keeps the baby. This is no decision to make lightly, mind you, but it is a choice nonetheless (just as was the choice of not preventing an unwanted pregnancy....). Those who get abortions have enough pain and guilt for an entire lifetime without a bunch of pompous *******s calling them murderers for \"disobeying god's will\".\n \n See, as much as it's about consent, it's about outsiders not judging. We all have our opinions on how things should be.... even I have a certain moral code.... but I don't think it's right at all for others to force their ways into a situation they aren't involved in. Whether it's pro-life picketers harassing women who plan on getting abortions.... or Bible-thumpers preaching that homosexuality is a sin, and a \"cross to bear\".... everyone needs to handle their own business.\n \n Right is only right in the eye of the beholder. You may think being gay is bad and that all gays will go to hell unless they stop practicing their sexual desires, but I don't And people who are gay don't. And being that the Christian god is all-knowing, all-seeing, and all-powerful, and that this Christian god apparently created homosexuality, this benevolent force must understand the hatred and prejudice that homosexuals must endure daily just for being themselves. If being yourself means you're going to hell, then I'll see you bastards there. emoticon_xbye",

You are offering no real choice, because everything is right and okay. If everything is right, then there's no choice. It's all the same, like if there was only one brand of breakfast cereal to choose from, and even if it's in different packages, it's still the same - there's no real choice unless there's an option for something different.\n \n God gives you choice. Good or bad.\n \n Why do you still feel guilt? Surely if it's totally up to you then anything goes.\n \n \nBy the way... do you own a dog/cat?

So those codes must be more valid....\n \n \nIt's not a ploy. I am always trying to be careful to make sure we're dealing with the same thing. It is good for you to also.\n\n \n You try to trip up any argument that you have no footing against based on language.

Incest is a term I mean to cover all close-relationships such as mother/son, siblings, father/daughter. I agree with Mizmaxx on this. Such acts are fraught with trouble and even 'consenting' adults should not do this. Mizmaxx should also realise that here she now has changed shift, because before 'consent' (between adults) meant a green light\n\n \n All opinions. Absolutely right or wrong? Nope.\n \n \nAs you're all in favour of suicide, then this is surely a great example of that, only there's no waste involved! It's perfect :)\n\n \n To think that someone would consent to that is a far stretch of the imagination. I can imagine perhaps going as far into the act as allowing a \"nibble\".... then realizing the pain is so horrid that it was a mistake. At this point, there is no consent.\n \n \nWhy [should we intervene in] only 'many' [cases of suicide] why not all?\n\n \n If some old lady has nothing but a billion stray cats that she tries to look after, has no family, no friends, in generally lonely and miserable, and has no real reason to linger about in this life, I wouldn't dream of second guessing her. If you did try and stop her, you'd simply prolong her suffering.\n \n \nThe guilt you feel is because of what you've done, not because of the Church. If you really believed in what you say you do you'd say \"F*ck the Church\", in which case the church's opinion should matter naught.\n\n \n This is impossible to prove. Nearly all morals in western society come from Christianity.... not necessarily because it was the right path, just because it was so widespread. Any moral code taught to a person is tinged with Christian law. Do you think that in our prehistoric times, when mankind was in its infancy, people felt guilt about sexuality??? Hell, no! It's only when a person or group of people confront you and tell you what you are doing is evil do you actually begin to second guess yourself.\n \n Now, even though I don't respect Christianity as a whole, a lot of people I know are Christian. And it's impossible to separate people and their religions. So when someone I know, whose opinion I generally value, comes up to me and says, \"You know, you're going to hell because you have sex, aren't married yet, and have never felt bad about it,\" I'm probably going to feel a little bad. That's not to say I'm going to stop being with my fianc\u00e9e because someone told me it's wrong, but I'm still going to think about it, even for just a second.\n \n Same goes with homosexuality.... with suicide.... it's not real guilt.... do you think a homosexual actually feels guilt when he's making love to someone? No. The person's close friends and family, and even his or her religion and church, simply force a bad vibe upon him or her.... it's a stigma that's existed for years, so of course, you're going to feel bad when met with tons and tons of opposition. But were there no opposition, gay and straight would not exist. All genders would just love whomever they wanted.\n \n I do, however, say \"**** the church!\" quite often. emoticon_xangel \n \n \nYes, that's what choice is. To choose one thing or the other. You are offering no real choice, because everything is right and okay. If everything is right, then there's no choice. It's all the same, like if there was only one brand of breakfast cereal to choose from, and even if it's in different packages, it's still the same - there's no real choice unless there's an option for something different.\n\n \n You are blind. God cannot be a choice. To choose the opposite of god would be to not exist. And that's impossible. Yeah, it it like choosing cereal. There's a shitload of different brand names, though (YHWH, god, allah, etc.). But no matter what cereal you choose, it's all cereal.\n \n You propose that when we choose our cereal, we either choose cereal or we make our own choice to eat nails. Where the hell did the nails come from??? Proposterous!\n \n \nGod gives you choice. Good or bad.\n\n \n To stick with your own analogy, you want to put labels of absolute quality on these cereals. I, myself, love GrapeNuts. Most people do not. Likewise, I eat my cereal with orange juice (I had a childhood allergy to dairy, and never acquired a taste for milk). You may say that the almighty cereal, HoneyComb, is the best. I disagree. Maybe the Post company wants you to love HoneyComb so much, you'll buy it forever. But I see through that marketing scheme. I won't suffer due to lack of HoneyComb.... I'll just eat my GrapeNuts with orange juice, warmed up in the microwave.... no nails.\n \n \nWhy do you still feel guilt? Surely if it's totally up to you then anything goes.\n\n \n I don't really feel guilty until someone I respect disapproves. It's usually due to morals, and thus, Christianity that they disapprove, so I try and shrug it off.... but no matter what, if my very Catholic grandparents think I'm doing something wrong, I'll still feel a little guilt. It's the people I'm disappointing moreso than the \"god\".\n \n \nAh-ha! :)\n Before when I used a poor analogy of consent - using the example of bestiality - you claimed that the animal could not consent.\n\n \n It's grey. Animals do consent, by not leaving their owner, but by rather following and bonding with him or her. But we don't know for sure that the animal is not being forced. As with this bestiality XXXX, the animal could consent, I suppose.... an animal in heat will have sex whenever. The animal could fight back if it chose not to consent.... but we don't know for sure if passive behavior alone is consent.\n \n But unless the well-being of the animal is at stake or is in question.... who cares about consent? You can't love an animal like you could another intelligent, emotional person. You compare animals to homosexuals. It's good to see that with all that holy spirit in your blood, you still have some hardcore humanitarian views....\n \n \n[The ability to give adult consent is] Based on what? Your criteria?\n\n \n What criteria does a parent use to determine whether or not her child is old enough to say out past dark? Observation of the individual's behavior. Credibility. It's all subjective and changes from case to case.... there are no absolutes in this existence.... just perceptions.\n \n \nThen what criteria do you use?\n\n \n As long as I feel someone is intelligent enough to fully understand the choice being made and all of the consequences of said choice, they are capable of giving consent. The criteria change based on what type of \"consent\" is being argued.\n \n \nBy the way, I'm not arguing against the legal age, it's just that one of you is countering everything is based on being a consensual adult - and 'adult' can mean many things - a legal definition for example.\n\n \n It's all grey matter.... see above for details.\n \n \nKillakozzy, you seem to have a rule that says everything is right... don't bring people down by telling them something's wrong.\n \n But some things are certain.\n\n \n Give me an example of anything that you know for certain! Philosophers have debated about the truth of our very existence for millenia! Even the old quote, \"I think, therefore I am,\" is debatable. Nothing is certain. Except everything. emoticon_xgood",

   "For example, right now all the \"Christians\" arguing with us are in direct defiance of Scripture- Romans 14 and 15 1-10, because they are pushing people away from God by being self-righteous and narrow-minded.\n\n \n\n Not really...not if we are being genuine. 1 Peter 3:15 \"Always be prepared to make a defense to any one who calls you to account for the hope that is in you, yet do it with gentleness and reverence...\"\n\n \n I won't argue that the Bible isn't inconsistent, just that you aren't following the rules.\n \n \nThat's for sure one good reason not to be Christian. They say they're about love, but really they just want you to follow their rules. Inconsistent and irrelevant rules, that only cause pain and destroy families.\n\n \nInteresting. Christianity is one of the last bastions defending the family and it is accused of destroying it.\n\n \n What's interesting is that people who claim to be \"the last bastions defending the family\" go about destroying perfectly good ones because of some misguided genital mis-matching theory.\n \n \nAs one of you doubts. It is because these moral codes are consistent that they are valid. If God turned around tomorrow and said, \"Okay, raping cats is okay\", you'd question it.\n\n \n If \"God\" turned around one day and said anything, I'd question everything, montalban. emoticon_xangel \n \n My point was that I doubt that your sources are valid to begin with. Consistency has nothing to do with it. I don't believe in their \"God\", and I don't believe they speak for \"him\".\n \n \nMizmaxx should also realise that here she now has changed shift, because before 'consent' (between adults) meant a green light \n\n \n Not at all. Just because I believe consent is necessary does not mean I believe everything consenting is a good idea. However, no one has come forward with a reason (aside from the ecclesiactical) why homosexuality is a problem.\n \n It's like this- someone says, \"well, rape is wrong because it's immoral, and gay sex is wrong because it's immoral\". \n \n I say,\"these are different things. Rape is wrong because it's not consensual. Gay sex isn't non-consensual\".\n \n You say, \"AHA! So everything consensual is ok? You are contradicting yourself!\"\n \n No. I believe rape is wrong because it isn't consensual. That doesn't mean I think everything consensual is ok, or isn't harmful. However, homosexuality is ok, because it isn't harmful, and it is good in general to share love. That doesn't mean that I think it's a good thing for Dahmer to chop up his boyfriends any more than you saying \"heterosexuality is the only way\" means you approve of heterosexual child molestation.\n \n \nWhy only 'many' why not all?\n\n \n Because in some situations this is a good decision for them, in others it isn't. However, in the end if someone really wants to kill themselves they will, whether or not I think it's a good idea.\n \n \nBefore when I used a poor analogy of consent - using the example of bestiality - you claimed that the animal could not consent.\n\n \n I didn't say they couldn't consent to anything. I said they couldn't consent to human sex. \n \n \nBased on what? Your criteria?\n\n \n No, based on this book here called \"The Answer to Everything\". emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Just imagine for a second that the world is not dichotomous, that there is a complex and messy reality behind every hypothetical situation. Like, for example, if a friend my age (mid-twenties) came to me and said they had fallen in love with a teenager, someone ten years younger, and asked if I disapproved. I would have to honestly tell them that I was doubtful that their relationship could ever be healthy and equitable, but I would have to see/know more to be sure. If it seemed that-\n a) the older person involved was very careful of dynamics of power in the relationship\n b) the younger person was very mature and realistic in their view of the older person\n c) the relationship was healthy and functional\n d) they had not been introduced in a way that set up a power dynamic, such as student/teacher, patient/therapist, child/friend of parents', etc.\n e) my friend was aware of any relative danger of being put in jail for the relationship\n - than I don't see how I would have grounds to argue that my friend was doing wrong by that person by being in a relationship with them. The odds of that being the case are slim to none. So, I can sit here and cast about probabilities based on age/gender/difference in age/relative maturity, make a graph, an equation, etc. But suffice to say that it depends on the relationship whether a relationship is healthy, and it depends on the situation whether a person is abusing of another. If I ever think someone is abusing another person, I will try to my best to stop it, but my power has it's limits.\n \n Happy New Year to you too, montalban. emoticon_xhoho It is too early for me, but I guess it's the right time of year for you.",

So, some steal, some lie, some lust, some kill, some cheat, some disrespect, some dishonor parents, some oppress others, and some of us turn out to be gay.

Hence, Christ chided the Pharisees for being judgemental. We judge on behavior. It seems Christ does not single anyone out and he seems to have befriended the bottom dregs (as percieved by Hebrew society)...Today, I suggest those same dregs would be gay as well.\n \n \n A gay person has no better or less chance of salvation than anyone else, if I read the ministry of Christ correctly. Why should saved sinners, Christians, separate themselves from their gay brothers and sisters? I don't see anything wrong with boldly stating that someone can be gay and be saved.\n \n -peace",

   "I don't really think that any incestual relationship of mature adults is actually consentual. Even in the animal kingdom, while creatures mate with close relatives (i.e. cousins), instinct discourages mother/son, father/daughter, and sibling pairings. Now, it does occasionally happen, and since I'm not fit to tell two thinking individuals that their actions are wrong, I would not object. I don't think I could do that, and because it's somewhat abnormal, I don't think I could be around those who participated in such a relationship openly, but hey, it's not me who's doin' the inbreeding. ;) \n \n \n Does unwillingness to tell two thinking individuals that their actions are wrong apply to all actions? \n \n I do appreciate your candor but most of your answers seem not to be an answer. You say that things are abnormal and that you wouldn't want to be around it, or do it yourself yet you find it bad form to denounce it. The only thing you seem to take a stand on is the fact that no one should take a stand.\n \n \nEven in close inbreeding, the rate of harmful mutation, by the way, is nominal. In a recent Discover magazine, I read an article by a genetics expert who informed that the odds for genetic mutation in such cases are something like 3%.... consequently, the expert also noted that the odds for mutation are the same for children conceived by women over age 40. Is having a baby over age 40, too, a sin?\n\n \n The rate of genetic mutation is not the determinant of whether an action is sinful in the Christian perspective.\n \n \nI support the ideas of not raping small woodland creatures.... but I don't necessarily think it's wrong to abort an unborn fetus. Late-term abortions are ****ed up, but in the first trimester, when the child is really not a child so much as a child-in-the-making, it's up to the giver of this life, the mother.\n \n \n you say rape of animal=violence against animal without consent\n you do not say abortion=violence against fetus without consent\n \n you say if the animal consents then it is legitimate sex\n there has been no comment on the idea that if the fetus consents it is legitimate eviction/violence \n \n you say that the animal can never truly consent so there is really no chance for bestiality to occur legitimately\n You do not say that there is no real way to determine consent of the fetus so there is no chance for abortion to occur legitimately\n \n you instead resort to the idea that the fetus is not a child but one in the making\n What makes the animal's inability to consent different than the \"child in the making's\" inability to consent?\n \n Do you believe the other \"giver of life,\" the father, should have rights in regard to his child?\n \n \nThose who get abortions have enough pain and guilt for an entire lifetime without a bunch of pompous *******s calling them murderers for \"disobeying god's will\".\n\n \n To say an action is murder and to single out women and persecute them specifically are two different things. I would hope that most pro-lifers do not act maliciously in that regard. Keep in mind that the pro-life group is the one ministering to those who have had abortions because they recognize that there are after effects of it. The pro-abortion group denies the consequences because it damages their cause and often offer no post-abortion help. The pro-life group does not shun these women. They embrace them. They attempt to help the women see how dmaging the act of abortion is.\n \n By the way, why do you say that those getting an abortion have pain and guilt?\n \n \nSee, as much as it's about consent, it's about outsiders not judging. We all have our opinions on how things should be.... even I have a certain moral code.... but I don't think it's right at all for others to force their ways into a situation they aren't involved in. Whether it's pro-life picketers harassing women who plan on getting abortions.... or Bible-thumpers preaching that homosexuality is a sin, and a \"cross to bear\".... everyone needs to handle their own business.\n\n \n Is a statement against homosexuality not expressing one's opinion? The problem with taking the approach that everyone should handle one's own business is that inevitably someone's business interferes with another person's. But I agree with the idea of personal reponsibility that you convey. \n \n \nAnd being that the Christian god is all-knowing, all-seeing, and all-powerful, and that this Christian god apparently created homosexuality, this benevolent force must understand the hatred and prejudice that homosexuals must endure daily just for being themselves. \n \n \n I'm not sure that God created homosexuality. But the Catechism of the Catholic Church acknowledges the difficulties of homosexuality Paragraph 2358 \"The number of men and women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies is not negligible. This inclination, which is objectively disordered, constitutes for most of them a trial. They must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided. These persons are called to fulfill God's will in their lives and, if they are Christians, to unite to the sacrifice of the Lord's Cross the difficulties they may encounter from their condition.\"\n \n \nIf being yourself means you're going to hell, then I'll see you bastards there. :xbye\n\n \n I'm not sure why this animosity is warranted.\n \n \nIf all parties involved wish to participate and willingly accept the emotional/physical consequences of being with multiple \"wives\" or \"husbands\", then yeah, it's fine with me. But I prefer a monogamous relationship to devote myself to.... much easier, it is.... \n \n \n You believe there are unique emotional and physical consequences to certain types of relationships that are not present in monogamous ones? \n \n \nYes. If it's truly love, and it's truly consentual.... \n \n \n Recently, I read an article about a Porn marketer who was arrested (I searched the net to find the article and I can't locate it yet). His films depicted rape scenes. They depicted violent sex scenes with the women being punched at times. If I'm not mistaken the man and his wife may have been in the films. Two mature adults, both giving consent. What is your opinion on this? Is it okay being that the conditions for consent and maturity are met? Or can certain sexual actions cause harm in the presence of maturity and consent?",

   "But how can Christians or anyone think that the mere act of loving someone of the same sex physically or emotionally is wrong? I don't care if it's in the Bible.... if god will only accept certain types of love in this day and age, god is not as wise as one would think.... emoticon_ic \n \n Beggars can't be choosers. Love is love. Love thy neighbor.\n \n And also, someone else posted up about women gettin' it in the backside.... that, as well, is not for reproduction. Isn't that evil? Or a knowingly sterile couple having sex.... they aren't reproducing. Isn't that evil?\n \n I think Christian dogma is too screwed up to know what it believes.... let alone why....! \"You're going to hell for loving Kevin anally, Bob.... unless you apologize and repent to GOD!\"\n \n This should be a scene in a comedy. :)\n\n \n cozzy, No one goes to hell for any of the above mentioned sins. Your statement seems to imply that this one sin is what will send you to hell. No what would send any person to hell is rejecting salvation from hell. Gay men and straight men are on a one way trip to hell the day they are born. Only those who get off this road and choose the road to heaven escape hell. This is accomplished by accepting Christ as savior. Now this new raod does have some interesting characterisitcs. Every one on this raod wants to be perfect. None of them are but they want to be. Therefore any person in a habitual willful sin against God is not on this raod but rather still on the road to hell. \n \n As to refrence you questions on sex. I am not a sexual councilor, but I do know some of the good advice some have given. Sexual love is to be shared with in a married relationship in the privacy of the bedroom. That doesn't mean only in the bedroom. But it does mean that it is to be secure and private. What is done in that bedroom is btween the man and his wife. Oral, anal, mammory, and diffrent positions are not the publics intrest. Sex is to be enjoyed. The Bible is complete in its description of sex for pleasure, as well as reprodution.",

   "[QUOTE=killacozzy]The stuff you reference is very consentual, controlled, and usually, very mild. The \"pleasure from pain\" thing kinda disproves you. How can there be harm when the so-called \"harm\" brings one pleasure?\n \n And by the way, the only way things can genuinely be mentally harmful is if the person feels guilt about them. And guess what? Guilt is offered mostly by a third party. When both parties consent, there can be no real guilt. Now, if the consent was kinda half-assed, then there may be some mental scarring.... but then again, marriage and television can leave mental scarring. Are marriage and television sins??? One my god, they're not???\n \n \n \n Let me requote the most important line here.\n \n \n \n Men with flaws recorded your Bible. Men with flaws dictate to the people what \"god's word\" is. Therefore, men are not good \"witnesses\" to god's word. The Bible is not a very reliable document for evidence of what's morally right and wrong in the 21st century.\n \n So where's the proof of your point....?[/QUOTE\n \n \n Many things that are harmful are pleasurable. Obesity of the american nation shows but one instance. There are to many to mention here. The truly awaking moment is when you discover what it is inyour life which is harmful, and how damaging it has been over time. One drink does not an aclcholic make, but it makes the secondand third easier; and so on untill a dependancy is established. One with a dependancy usually has to hit bottom before he is enlightened to his harmful lifestlye, but that doesn't mean someone just satarting out down that path or some one half way there is doing any less harm. \n \n Secondly you seem to think that these flawed men included flaws inthere writing. God tells us otherwise in scripture. In Peters Gospel He tells us that the inspitation they recieved is better than eyewitness account.",
