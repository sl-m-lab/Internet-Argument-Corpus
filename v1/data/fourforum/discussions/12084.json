   "While US are staying in the most dramatic crisis Pentagon and Washington are busy not so much in patching up local economy but rather trying to prevent any new centers bring to life.\n \n In fact American officials are well aware of the fact that the financial crisis has undermined their positions in the world dramatically and the single way to keep afloat is curbing of the rivals! Look, in this matter Americans are keeners and the oil price is suitable device!\n \n Low oil prices are no good for oil extracting states and those rapidly developing countries. As for the latter ones their pace of development may be ensured only due to some new expensive oil projects to extract more oil and they are viable only amid high stable prices for it! \n \n All in all, Americans are curbing oil prices intently and so the development of many states they see as rivals. Imo that America's role is egoistic and destructive for world's wealth and stability.",
