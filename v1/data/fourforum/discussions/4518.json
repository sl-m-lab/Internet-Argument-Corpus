   "Hi, I have been in absentia for a while, but have become rather caught up in a debate on the subject of the drug Adderall XR and it's recent suspension Canada.\n http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/short/40/5/2\n \n \n I am not anti ADHD, but I do believe it is way overdiagnosed [I was personally diagnosed with this, only to be rediagnosed with PTSD] .\n \n I am a firm believer in all people diagnosed with ADHD also undertaking cognitive behavior therapy, instead of jumping on the meds bandwagon as soon as they can.\n \n I'm coming up against a brick wall of pro-drugs versus anti-drugs, and I believe the answer lies somewhere in the middle.\n \n This is the place where drugs are the main treatment and choice of treatment for ADHD. The locked threads are where debate has become too \"hot\" emoticon_wow .\n \n Many people who are not supportive of drug therapy are being threatened with Bannings and suspensions. Sad!\n \n http://www.addforums.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=29\n \n I would really like input on what many of you may think of ADHD medications; particularly the Adderall XR which is \"supposed\" to be a once a day med, but many are confessing to 2+ times a day.\n \n I look forward to any of your thoughts,\n Anastasia",
