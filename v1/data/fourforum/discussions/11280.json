   "As Wayland Union High School students cleaned out their lockers on the last day of school, a fight between three freshmen girls erupted, leaving one girl with facial injuries.\n \n Wayland police told 24 Hour News 8 the fight happened after fourth period Tuesday, and they have interviewed two suspects plus the victim, who was a new student this year at Wayland Union High School.\n \n Police are investigating the incident as a hate crime, saying the suspects told them the girl was a gay-rights advocate at the school and was trying to in their words \"impose her views on them.\"\n \n Aggravated assault charges and hate crime charges are possible.\n \n The fight was clearly premeditated, say police. In surveillance video, police told 24 Hour News 8 the suspects are seen pulling back their hair and getting ready. It is also clear, they say, other people knew about the attack because of the number of people who were congregated around watching the fight.\n \n \"It was a pretty vicious attack on the one gal. She didn't know it was coming,\" Wayland Police Chief Dan Miller said. \"She obviously went down to the floor very quick and tried to fend off her attackers.\"\n \n The victim's father told 24 Hour News 8 his daughter is doing \"quite well\" considering the circumstances. On Wednesday, she went to the family doctor who told her she would have a black eye for a few more days but has no broken bones and no permanent damage.\n \n \"I thought it was typical teenage stuff until I saw the video and I heard everything that happened,\" the victim's father said. \"I got a phone call about an hour later [after the incident] and I was told that she was being looked over by the EMTs and making sure she didn't have a concussion.\"\n \n His daughter told him two girls jumped her from behind. One of the girls beat her as the other taped it and later put it on the Internet. The girl's father says the video convinces him the incident was preplanned.\n \n \"The video started 10 seconds before the attack took place. To me it wasn't a fight. It was an attack,\" he said.\n http://www.woodtv.com/Global/story.asp?S=8464200&nav=menu44_2\n emoticon_xdonno \n \n Pre-meditated, all the way.\n And the girls involved didn't see anything wrong with what they did... emoticon_wow \n \n And of course, the tell-tale, propagandic \"impose her views on them\".\n While I don't in any sense think that phrase =< violence, I do see it as an indicator of the irrationality of some people.\n \n Telling somebody that they can't adopt because they are gay? THAT is \"imposing views upon others\".\n Telling somebody that they cannot PREVENT somebody from adopting just because they don't like gays? That is NOT \"imposing views upon others\".",
