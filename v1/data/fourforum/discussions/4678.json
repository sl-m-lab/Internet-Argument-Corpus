It is only an emotion, that can be fleeting, long lasting or distanced. Love is also individual. Who is to say what love is for any one person. Love is not to be confused with committment.\n \n Committment is when you have taken someone you love and decided they are they only one, and you will not faulter. You will stay with thema dn keep the love alive.",

If it's love it grows, if not....well u know...\n\n \n \n Exactly right. That is why I call falling in love, a senseless euphoria. There is a great difference between being \"in love\" and falling in love. And yes, falling in love for the first time is the only REAL sense of it, and it happens when we are real young and in our first serious relationship. After that one falls apart, the heart puts up a self preservation wall, and does not allow the same depth and inflated feelings, when starting out in future relationships. And the word fall  fits well :) \n \n That falling part happens when two people first start out in a relationship, both fired up from the combination of physical attraction and superficial compatibility. Rationale is void, and after the first year, those hyped up feelings will evolve in to the beginnings of a \"in love\" relationship, or as a lot do, they will finally regain their normal senses and find the person they \"fell\" in love with, is not who they really thought they were after all. ..\n \n It takes years to become \"in love\" with someone, only days to fall  in love. jmo",
