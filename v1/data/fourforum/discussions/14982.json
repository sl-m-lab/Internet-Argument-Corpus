   "Brady before I go into the finer detail of picking apart your latest attention whoring technique I'm going to ask a simple question, and I expect an answer to be given in return.\n \n Is there any proof to suggest that these black individuals who were killed were victims of racial violence perpetrated by white individuals?\n \n If no such evidence exists then I fail to see the relevancy of including \"blacks\" in the title unless you're hoping to use the old correlation/causation method of debate. Making an attempt to claim that since the victims were black then that must mean the victimizers had to be white.\n \n Despite what many might wish to claim, black on black violence isn't unheard of. Black people are just as capable and willing to hurt other black people as anybody. Black people even attack asians, and I have proof. A Race Against Time: Black Students Attack 26 Asian Students at Philadelphia High School; CBS Blames Whites\n \n Something else to consider is the gang involvement of the matter. One can't possibly ignore the fact that gang violence against minorities isn't unheard of. And gang members aren't likely to be in legal possession of their weapons so that goes against whatever message you might be trying to make.\n \n Gangs in the United States - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n \"There were at least 30,000 gangs and 800,000 gang members active across the USA in 2007, up from 731,500 in 2002 and 750,000 in 2004. By 1999, Hispanics accounted for 47% of all gang members, Blacks 34%, Whites 13%, and Asians 6%.\"\n \n 34% of 800,000 is 272,000. That's quite a large number of black gang members out there to deal with.\n \n I unfortunately lack the detailed records of what gangs reside in which states and what cities they're most concentrated in, and acquiring them will take some time. This is especially complicated by the number of out of state gangs that hold unofficial territory in various states they're not native to. But I should be able to dig up some evidence later on that will at least cast doubt on whatever figured you're trying to pull.\n \n The only logical conclusion I can reach for you mentioning blacks in the title, rather than going with a message like \"too many innocent people victimized by guns\" or \"too many children victimized by guns\" or even \"too many women victimized by guns\" is that you're attempting to play the racial hatred card.\n \n So if your ultimate goal is to try and pass the message of \"Gun owners are racist! Look at how many black people were shot and killed!\" it's not going to let it fly. Even if you try and get it up off the ground I'm going to ground it thoroughly and leave you with no credible argument.",

   "Kind of a misleading OP, and I'm not sure I get the point. It's not a secret that people are shot and killed every day in this country, but by using the word 'victimization,' it sounds like you are claiming black people are targeted as some type of racial profiling or something, and that's not the case. Here's a pretty sad statistic:\n \n \nThe statistics tell a tragic story. According to federal crime figures, homicide is the leading cause of death among African-American males aged 15 to 34. They also indicate that between 1976 and 2004, 94 percent of black murder victims were killed by black offenders. \n\n \n KillBobC - Kill Black On Black Crime\n \n Sounds like there is a lot more to black on black crime than the generic \"too many guns\" argument.",

   "Galileo you're really going to wish you didn't make this argument. I've seen some whoppers before but this one is certainly in the running. I can't wait to begin devastating it.\n \n \n\"As noted at the beginning of this study, the devastation homicide inflicts on black teens and adults is a national crisis, yet it is all too often ignored outside of affected communities.\n\n \n Already I have to disagree. Homicide inflicts devastation on everyone involved. Black people aren't uniquely affected by the murder of friends and family. They don't have a specific disposition to devastation after hearing about their best friend being killed, or seeing them shot in a drive by shooting.\n \n \n\"For blacks, like all victims of homicide, guns&#8212;usually handguns&#8212;are far and away the number one murder tool.\n\n \n Even if this is the truth, so what? What exactly does that have to do when dealing with the devastation of homicide suffered by black people?\n \n \nSuccessful efforts to reduce America&#8217;s black homicide toll must put a focus on reducing access and exposure to firearms.\"\n http://www.vpc.org/studies/blackhomicide11.pdf\n\n \n Reducing access and exposure to firearms for whom? Blacks? Whites? Asians? Gay people? Who needs to have reduced access and exposure to firearms? What group needs to be told that they have too much exposure to guns?\n \n I fail to see how reducing legal access and responsible exposure to firearms will do anything to stop the gang related black on black murders that society chooses to ignore because it's politically incorrect to blame blacks for acts of violence.\n \n \nMichael Moore talks about how guns stolen from white people often end up in poor black neighborhoods where they contribute to the homicide rate:\n\n \n I've seen no evidence to suggest that the majority of murders of black people are carried out by white individuals. In fact I've seen quite the opposite.\n \n USA - Interracial crime at a glance and Statistics\n \n What will it take to stop black-on-black crime? | Minnesota Public Radio News\n \n Black on Black Crime Coalition\n \n \n\"The vast majority of guns in America are purchased and owned- that is, introduced into society- by white people.\n\n \n So what exactly? What does white have to do with anything?\n \n \nEach year about 500,000 guns are stolen, mostly from these same white people in the suburbs. And the vast majority of those guns end up in the inner city, sold cheaply or traded for legal or illegal goods and services.\n\n \n I'd like to see what evidence Michael Moore is basing his opinions on. How exactly did he verify his sources? Keep in mind Michael Moore has been criticized for his \"creative editing\" in his Bowling for Columbine movie. Or as it's more accurately known out and out lying.\n \n \n\"These white guns have caused an enormous amount of death and suffering among African-Americans. Gunfire is the No. 1 cause of death among young blacks. Black men between the age of 15 and 24 are almost six times more likely to be shot to death, (by other black men,) than white men in the same age group\n\n \n HOLD UP! Right there you say that black men are more likely to be shot by other black men. I think that just shoots down your \"black homicide is a crime carried out by white racist gun owners\" argument.\n \n \n\"No African-American owns a gun company.\n\n \n So what? Simply because black people don't own a gun company that doesn't prove anything at all. It's not some vast conspiracy designed to carry out the murder of ****ers.\n \n \nCruise through the part of your town where African-Americans live: there are no gun factories there. At prices that range from several hundred to several thousand dollars, most African-Americans can't afford to buy a Glock, Beretta, Luger, Colt, or Smith & Wesson. No black guy owns a plane that&#8217;s the smuggling automatic weapons into the country.\n\n \n Oh really? Most blacks can't afford the $500 to $800 price tag for a new gun? I find that hard to believe. Have you seen the statistics for blacks charged with drug crimes? Do you know how many black drug dealers there are?\n \n You're claiming most blacks aren't able to afford the price of a new gun. But previously you claimed that stolen guns were being sold in black communities for very cheap prices. Highly contradictory in my opinion.\n \n And don't go and claim that black people aren't responsible for weapon smuggling. Look at the drug violence and weapons smuggling in Colombia and South Africa. Who is in Colombia and south Africa? Black people.\n \n \nAll of this is done by whites. But sooner or later, thousands of these legally purchased guns end up in the hands of desperate people who live in poverty and live with their own set of fears.\n\n \n Exactly what point was made by Michael Moore that you're trying to pass off as your own opinion?\n \n \nTo introduce guns into this volatile environment- which we white people have done little to improve- is a deadly proposition.\n\n \n What exactly is Michael Moore saying that you're repeating here? Are you saying that black people shouldn't have guns? Wasn't this the standard operating procedure before the ratification of the 14th Amendment? Surely Michael Moore isn't claiming that we should abide by a \"no guns for ****ers\" standard when he's claiming that white people who owns guns are racist, right?\n \n Furthermore, constitutional rights are blind. They don't apply in a unique fashion dependent on a person's gender or race. I see no reason for why a black person, even a poor black person, should we told that they don't have rights. Do you?\n \n \n\"So if you're white, and you&#8217;d like to help reduce the number one cause of death among young black men, here's the answer: Don't buy a gun. Don't keep one in your house or car.\n\n \n This logic is no longer valid or acceptable. The Supreme Court ruling in the Heller case has put this argument to death. You can't tell someone \"If you want to reduce crime then don't exercise your constitutional rights.\" That simply doesn't work. Would you tell parents that if they want to reduce child pornography then they shouldn't have children or own a camera?\n \n \nNo guns laying around means no guns stolen to be resold in poor black neighborhoods.\n\n \n This is simplistic logic at its worst. There's not an ounce of truth to it. There's absolutely no way to remove guns from the equation and render them in a manner that would prevent them from being resold to others. That would be like saying \"If there was no disease then nobody would ever be sick.\" It's a nice thought but unrealistic and physically impossible. You might as well try and stop domestic violence stabbings by calling for a ban on kitchen knives.\n \n \nWherever you live, chances are that crime is at an all-time low. Chill out, sit back, and enjoy the good life an unlevel playing field has given you. If you're truly concerned about your protection, get a dog. Bad guys generally don't want to tussle with a crazy barking animal with sharp teeth.\"\n\n \n What's the answer if the dog is killed? A little poison meat and the guard dog is as much use as a 100 pound bag of potatoes.\n \n You just don't get it Galileo. Or perhaps I should say your latest cited source doesn't get it. Crime isn't limited to poor black neighborhoods. Crime can happen anywhere at anytime, no exceptions. Home invaders, abusive exes, psychotic killers, crazed arsonists, wild and rabid animals etc. they can strike without warning and if you aren't prepared then you WILL be dead. Rich white communities, poor black communities, rich black communities, latino communities, gay communities, etc. none of them are exempt from random acts of crime and violence. \n \n You can't just tell somebody \"You're alright, you don't need a gun to protect yourself.\" That would be like somebody telling you that you don't need to own any books because you've got the internet. It's like telling people they don't need a burglar alarm as long as the police are around.\n \n It's posts like this that make me think you're not interested in honest debate.",

   "There are some very interesting conclusions that can be reached in this thread.\n \n First we have Galileo citing Michael Moore who claims that gun ownership is racist because most black people can't afford to pay the prices the market demands for new high quality guns.\n \n And then we have politicians who are trying desperately to ban so-called \"Saturday Night Special\" handguns that usually retail for around $100, claiming that they're the prime choice of weapons for criminals because they can afford to use them and toss them.\n \n Now if black people can't afford to pay $500 for a Glock that would mean they might have to resort to a Jiminez for $100 right? Wouldn't that mean this move by politicians to ban so-called \"Saturday Night Specials\" would wind up disarming black people by moving gun ownership into a higher tax bracket and thus making it a \"privilege of the rich\" rather than a right of the people? Even back in the era of the Civil War there were laws that prevented freed blacks from owning any guns other than the biggest and most expensive that were on the market.\n \n So who's really racist here? The average American gun owner, or the politician who's basically saying \"poor people have no right to own a gun\" by trying to ban cheap guns?",

All of this is done by whites. But sooner or later, thousands of these legally purchased guns end up in the hands of desperate people who live in poverty and live with their own set of fears.

   "I must apologize. My last few posts have been rushed due to a lack of time to sit down and properly compose myself. But at the moment I have all the time I need to put my usual amount of work into my posts and generate the kind of quality I pride myself on. And now we can let the dissection begin.\n \n \nMichael Moore is violating no one's rights by advising people not to own a handgun. In fact, his free speech on this matter is constitutionally protected. If you think Heller somehow banned people from expressing an opinion about the matter then you are seriously misinformed. You have advocated violating doctors' rights and now this.\n \n \n Simply because Michael Moore's speech is protected by the Constitution that doesn't mean it's appropriate, anymore than protesting at the funeral of a dead 9 year old girl who was killed by a crazed madman.\n \n You can pretend all you want but that won't change the simple and undeniable fact that gun ownership is constitutionally protected and recognized as an individual right. No matter what you say, no matter who you cite nothing is ever going to change that fact. Not even a direct quote from Jesus Christ is going to undo the rulings of Heller and McDonald. You have no choice but to accept that fact and move on.\n \n Michael Moore's message of \"don't own a gun\" is literally him telling other people \"don't exercise your constitutional rights.\" Michael Moore is using his First Amendment rights to lecture other people on how they shouldn't use their rights because he doesn't agree with them. For a proper comparison that would be like us telling Michael Moore to never make another movie for as long as he lived because we don't support his lies and BS.\n \n You can't simply tell people to not exercise their rights. That would be like telling someone \"don't read any books\", \"don't take part in religion\", \"don't protest the government\", \"don't require the police to obtain a search warrant\", \"don't seek out legal council for any reason\", \"don't express yourself in a manner that could be offensive to others\" or any manner of other methods in which we exercise our constitutionally recognized and protected rights.\n \n Michael Moore's message isn't accepted. Nor will we tolerate such nonsense being passed around as so-called \"expert advice.\"\n \n \nI think Michael Moore is right. More legal guns in a society means more illegal guns. The more legal guns there are in circulation the more opportunities for criminals to obtain guns.\n\n \n That's the best argument you can come up with? Really? More legal guns means more opportunities for criminals to use them? Please tell me you aren't serious about this.\n \n I could go into a great deal of discussion explaining exactly why this simplistic logic is wrong. But instead I'm going to try a different tactic and show you exactly why you're wrong for making such a statement and why you shouldn't make it again at any future point. Your statement is that a legal right enables criminals to get ahead. This logic is freely offered up when it comes to guns, but anybody who offers up the same advice for other matters is shunned for uttering it.\n \n There is simply not a single thing available in society that a criminal won't exploit to get ahead. Should we apply your logic to everything? Electronics and jewelry are stolen from their rightful owners to be sold on the black market for drug money. Should we tell people that they can't own expensive jewelry or plasma screen TVs because some drug addict might use them to buy thousands of dollars worth of cocaine with it?\n \n How about the protections a person has in the legal system? Criminals are always finding a way to exploit these protections. Search warrants for example. How many times is evidence suppressed because the search was carried out illegally without a properly authorized warrant? How many times has incriminating evidence been lost while police are obtaining a warrant? Imagine how much more streamlined things would be if we did away with this requirement and let the police simply storm into any location they said was of interest and search every nook and cranny of every single building in the quest for evidence and illegal contraband, and then use what they find in a court of law at trial with no way for the defense to have the evidence thrown out. Conviction rates would skyrocket because everything would be in and nothing could be hidden in the matter. Illegal searches and seizures would be a thing of the past because no criminal would be able to protest the searches.\n \n How about the right of the accused to have a speedy and public trial? Criminals and suspects are awarded trials where evidence is viewed and testimony is given. These complicate matters and can drag on for months at a time, and there's always the risk that the jury will acquit the accused despite overwhelming evidence to show that they're guilty. Or worse a prosecutor could offer a plea bargain for reduced charges. Trials are why there's a revolving door of justice, a catch and release system. If we didn't allow the accused to stand trial we could simply lock them up when they're caught and hold them indefinitely in secured facilities.\n \n What would double jeopardy? If the accused is acquitted of the charges against them then the court is barred from trying them for the exact same crime twice. If we did away with double jeopardy then this would be a thing of the past. If the prosecutors had reason to believe the accused was guilty but the jury saw otherwise then no problem, you just hold the accused, bring them up on trial again with a different jury in a different avenue and try again. And keep trying until you get the verdict that you want no matter how many times it takes. You could try the accused a dozen different times for the same offense and just keep trying them because you didn't like what the jury had to say.\n \n How about a person's right to seek redress for grievances against the government? Too often these public protests can turn into violent and even deadly riots where property damage and loss of life are too real a possibility, and this is all legal. If you outlaw public assembly then actions like these would ground to a halt. The police could arrest anyone who assembles in a group of three or more and they couldn't argue that they were being harassed for peaceful demonstrations. By disallowing redress of the government you could even silence those with dissenting opinions by outlawing their ability to criticize government actions. There would no longer be heated rhetoric being used because nobody would be allowed to have a differing opinion.\n \n What about freedom of speech? Neonazis and other white supremacists spread their message of hatred and intolerance and are protected by the First Amendment. They can advocate an all white nation, returning to slavery and even forced deportation of migrants. If there was no freedom of speech then this hate speech could easily be clamped down on. No longer could the message of intolerance be spread because anyone attempting to say anything the government didn't allow could be arrested and removed from society. If this goes on long enough then dissenting opinions can be weeded out and eventually there would only be one opinion for all of society and nobody could argue otherwise. If allowed to go on long enough an end of freedom of speech would eventually lead to a one party system of government. You might even be able to do away with the need of a new president every four years and simply elect a king who can rule for the rest of their lives, because to suggest a new president is needed would be to dissent from government sanctioned opinion and say something they don't support. \n \n What about money? If you're robbed then your hard earned money is being introduced to the criminal element and allowing them to get ahead in life at the expense of others. Maybe we should outlaw the private possession of money and mandate that your funding be held in secure banks at all times to the criminals can't gain access to it? We could outlaw home safes, wallets, loose change, etc. and then there would be no pickpockets because you'd have nothing worth stealing.\n \n How about children? Human trafficking is a serious issue and children are often the prime target to be trafficked because of all the sickos out there and the ease in moving them. Plus there are those who exploit children in the manufacture and distribution of kiddy porn, and they do this because children are available and able to be exploited. You wouldn't dare tell a parent to not have children would you? \n \n What about gasoline? You might need it for your car but gasoline is a prime choice of accelerant material for arsonists who want to burn down an office building or somebody's house. If you outlaw the ability of people to own spare gasoline then an arsonist wouldn't be able to steal it and burn something down with it. By outlawing excessive amounts of privately owned gasoline you might even be able to combat insurance fraud by making sure somebody doesn't file a claim on property they destroyed themselves.\n \n Are you beginning to see the error in your proposed logic yet? Simply because criminals can exploit something that's no excuse to use it as logic to argue in favor of restricting legal access. If that truly is the best argument you can come up with then you're out of luck.\n \n \nDo you think that it is a huge coincidence that nations in which fewer law abiding citizens own guns such as Australia and the UK also have much lower rates of gun crime? \n\n \n I've read your previous posts Galileo. I know that this is one of your other favorite arguments. You've constantly referred to what you call \"other developed nations\" without actually telling us what you consider to be developed nations, and hold up their example of gun control laws as something that we should strive to adopt and bring to our nation. I'm not going to be having this argument with you because I know how it'll go. You'll choose not to elaborate on what qualifies as a \"developed nation\" and leave it very open ended and ambiguous to the point it's pure nonsense.\n \n And then there's the fact that other nations are simply not America. What works for them doesn't work for us. Their people aren't the same, their customs aren't the same, their justice systems are the same, their treatment of their people aren't the same. You can't do a proper compare and contrast between an apple and a head of cabbage. All you're doing is trying to muddy the waters (that's another favorite of yours anytime somebody says something you don't agree with). To simply point at another country and cite their gun control as an example of why things are the way they are is intellectual dishonesty at its worst. Please try not to waste our time with such nonsense.\n \n \nIn fact, gun ownership by law abiding citizens may actually encourage crime rather than deter it:\n\n \n May actually? As in you think it might do something but have no proof to support it? For starters this is the worst example of logic to be offered when the discussion is for limiting constitutional rights. But I already covered that fact when I exploited your gun control logic and showed how it failed when applied to other matters.\n \n \n\"DURHAM, N.C. -- Everybody knows guns deter burglars, right? Not according to data from the National Crime Victimization Survey and the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports.\n \n \"In fact, having a gun in your home may actually increase your likelihood of being burgled, since guns are valuable 'loot' and gun-rich communities are profitable to burglars, researchers at Duke University and Georgetown University have found.\"\n\n \n I'm going to need to call bull of this one for so many reasons. I won't bother going into why these sources aren't credible, it'd be too easy. All one would need to do is find out if the Joyce Foundation granted them money for a gun control study and that would be it.\n \n The argument is that owning a gun might actually make you more likely to have your home burglarized. This is nonsense. A home can only be burglarized when the criminals have committed breaking and entering and are on your private property (and within the area in which the law says you can kill them). And the home is where people tend to most often keep their guns, away from the eyes of those who are too nosy for their own good. How is a criminal to know if the home they're breaking into has a gun in it before they enter it? Do these criminals perform stakeouts on gun stores and take down the license plate numbers of customers, maybe follow them home and see where they live? How do the criminals find out when outside of the home?\n \n There's also the fact that home burglary takes place in poor communities on a regular basis. You know the ones, the communities made up of black people who supposedly are too poor to actually buy guns in the first place. Why are burglaries so common in these communities if nobody can afford to own a gun in the first place? According to the logic you're citing they simply wouldn't happen there.",

Do you think that it is a huge coincidence that nations in which fewer law abiding citizens own guns such as Australia and the UK also have much lower rates of gun crime?\n\n \n More legal drugs in society means more illegal drugs. Everyone has heard about the elderly getting robbed for their pills... Let's get rid of the pills! Problem solved. \n \n Maybe a nation with absolutely no guns would be safer, but guess what? It's not possible to get rid of them. \n \n If you get rid of handguns, what prevents a criminal from using a rifle or a shotgun, or cutting down the barrel and stock to make their firearm concealable? \n \n What if they make all guns illegal? Well, there goes hunting, and the people who live out in the country lose their ability to protect themselves from wild animals, and farmers lose their ability to protect their crops and livestock. (In addition to the obvious lack of protection the average citizen would then have from criminals).\n \n Even if a gun ban did somehow get passed, the government would have no way of gathering all the firearms.

   "Due to having sufficient time to better construct my posts I felt it was a good idea to come back here and make several points that I failed to the first time around.\n \n \nWherever you live, chances are that crime is at an all-time low. Chill out, sit back, and enjoy the good life an unlevel playing field has given you.\n \n \n While some of might live in a neighborhood with very low crime rates that doesn't mean that we won't at some point become the possible victim of a crime at some point down the line. We don't live our entire lives in so-called \"safe neighborhoods\" where nothing bad ever happens. We commute to work, we have to cross through unsavory parts of town to get from Point A to Point B. People are accosted at the parking lot of work, at the grocery store, in traffic, in the park, etc. It's foolish to assume that simply living in a so-called \"safe neighborhood\" is sufficient protection from the evils of the world. There's nothing to prevent evil from coming into your neighborhood and making it a dangerous place to live. The border cities are a prime example of that fact. Before Felipe Calderon declared all out war on the drug cartels in Mexico they were a relatively safe location. Now they're a figurative and literal battle zone where people are being shot, beheaded and blown up.\n \n \nIf you're truly concerned about your protection, get a dog. Bad guys generally don't want to tussle with a crazy barking animal with sharp teeth.\"\n\n \n Of course this statement made by Michael Moore is much stupider than the previous statement regarding \"safe neighborhoods.\" Does anyone know how much expense goes into a dog for security purposes? It's a massive undertaking.\n \n First you have to get the right type of dog because not just any will do. A dog suitable for families with small children has no place when it comes to security because they're bred to be kind gentle and easygoing. A security dog isn't a good choice for a family pet because their temperament and upbringing would lead to them mauling small children and other family members. Letting your children play with a security dog would be no different than letting them play around a wood chipper. And expecting a family dog to provide security is like driving without a seat belt. So first you have to pick a dog for a specific and singular role and then you have to go out and get one. But getting the right kind of dog isn't that easy. You can't get a puppy mill dog with questionable heritage, you have to go to a breeder who charges a fortune in order to ensure the proper parentage has been observed in order to maximize effectiveness and obedience.\n \n After you get the right dog you have to undergo obedience training. And obedience training isn't cheap at all. We're talking hundreds of dollars to get the dog to learn how to obey its master. And then after obedience training you have to get the dog trained for its duties if you want it to be a guard dog, so it has to learn how to attack. And keep in mind that part of obedience training is for the owner to learn how to control the dog so really it's a two part effort, a partnership. If you aren't on your game then don't expect the dog to be any better.\n \n Then we come to food. Dogs can eat a great deal of food, especially the expensive food. Expect to be paying $20-50 a month on one bag of food. Food that can expire and needs to be thrown away. Food that can be tainted with e.coli or some other contaminate that can kill your dog and your security option.\n \n Next up are medical expenses. Vets charge a lot of money for even regular services like flea and tick medicine, heart worm protection, parvo immunizations, rabies vaccines, booster shots, annual physicals, etc. to say nothing of emergency medical services for serious conditions like opportunistic infections, injuries, bloat, distended abdomen, arthritis, constipation, intestinal worms, and a world of other issues that plague dogs of specific breeding. Veterinarians are trained medical professionals who charge a great deal for their services. Some charge more for their services than doctors for people would.\n \n And then there's all the daily care needed to ensure that your dog remains healthy and capable. Walks, exercise, baths, food, water, medicine, shelter, care, etc. it's a great deal of work that many simply aren't able to give. Dogs require a great deal of care just like people. With all the work you put into it you might as well be training a son to be your bodyguard.\n \n Take all these expenses for one year, multiply them by 15. You're looking at an investment of thousands of dollars for a security system with a very short lifespan. And all those thousands are necessary just to make sure the dog is in good condition to fulfill its duties.\n \n Then there are the safety hazards that must be considered with having a dog for protection. Even the best trained dogs can lash out and bite people, maul them, kill them for no reason. Imagine the hell there would be to pay if your trained guard dog got loose and killed a neighborhood child and had to be put down. You're out your dog, your investment, the money for the hospital bills and the legal fees and you're worse off than you were before.\n \n And what about cars? Dogs getting hit by cars is far too common. Or your dog could simply run away and you never see it again. It won't simply stay in your yard just because you tell it to; especially if you don't follow proper training procedures. If it sees a cat or another dog it can go charging off against orders.\n \n Allergies and phobias are another concern. There are people who are allergic to dogs and other animals that shed. Some of them have allergies so bad their airways will close up in the presence of some breeds and they'll be in need of medical attention in order to avoid dying as a result. And then there are the people who are absolutely terrified of the thought of being anywhere near a dog. Are you seriously going to tell them that their phobias aren't acceptable and they should get a dog anyway?\n \n And then there are the legal limitations of dog ownership. If you live in an apartment building you might be forbidden by law from owning a dog. And even if you can own one then don't expect it to be one of effective breeding or size to provide protection. So in these situations you can either have a home or you can have your protection but you don't get to have both. And then there are places that won't allow you to bring a pet in, places like the library or a grocery store. What's your answer for that? Leave the dog outside? What if you're accosted inside the store away from the dog? What good is all of those thousands of dollars then?\n \n Economically and physically a dog is the worst possible suggestion to make to someone who's seeking to gain personal and home protection against outside threats. The impracticalities greatly outweigh any potential gain that could be had by trusting your life to such an unpredictable and high maintenance animal.\n \n Gun ownership is considerably more affordable. The price of the gun, ammunition, training, storage, and maintenance equipment can be had for a mere fraction of a properly trained and healthy security dog. And what's more the gun will still be usable and fully functional 50 years down the line and can be passed onto your children and even your grandchildren, while that dog you suggested will be dead and just a buried skeleton at that point.\n \n Don't tell us to trust our lives to a dog.",

You have advocated violating doctors' rights and now this. \n \n I think Michael Moore is right. More legal guns in a society means more illegal guns.

I'm not one to deny him his right of speech. Most people feel they are extremely intelligent and that others are entitled to hear their views. The beauty of the 1st. Amendment is it allows people to choose to open their mouths and provide others with an opportunity to judge whether they really are as intelligent as they believe themselves to be. \n \n A similar freedom is true with the 2nd. Amendment. We each have the freedom to choose whether to own firearms or not. The difference between Moore and me on this issue is that I am not seeking to take away the freedom to make a choice I don't approve of....\n \n In my now 18 years experience with crime I believe there are three deterrent factors that every criminal considers at one time or another-1. The likelihood of getting caught, 2. The possibility of a lengthy jail or prison sentence if caught, and 3. The likelihood of being seriously injured in the crime. For the \"no one is home so let's go steal their stuff\" type of burglary (and in my experience this type of burglary is by far the most common) the deterrent threat of injury from an armed homeowner is largely ignored. But I cannot state that the reverse is true for guns in the home. In my experience it is very rare that burglars are tempted to target homes because guns are present. Unless they have been in the house (day labor worker for a home repair contractor, for example) they do not know if guns are present or not (although street rumor of your home having a lot of desirable items in it is a factor to watch out for). Absent any inside knowledge one temptation factor they do consider is the appearance of wealth the outside of the home presents. But these are all crimes of opportunity, and a far more important and frequent calculation (inside knowledge or not) is the likelihood that the residents are away at work and unlikely to come home and disturb them, and the presence or ability of neighbors/passers-by to see the crime and interrupt its progress. Now once they are in the home burglars look for items that are portable and that have solid value-game systems, TV's, jewelry, etc....and of course guns. Guns are just one item among many that are targets of opportunity once a burglar has time to rummage through your home. \n \n Having said this, I will say that I own several items that thieves would try to steal if they got into my home undisturbed. Yet I never have, and I never will, choose to be held hostage to the avarice of another. Their desire for my personal property-of whatever kind-will have no impact on my decision to own it and enjoy its use. The threat of thievery does, however, impact my decision on how to secure and protect my property from theft, just as the threat of violent crime impacts my decision to have access to a firearm when necessity arises. \n \n The beauty of this, as I would tell Mr. Moore should he be willing to listen, is this is America and I still have the freedom to choose to accept or reject his advice, and that I am free to live my life and choose what property I will own.",

There's sufficient evidence to suggest that such violence is real and common place.\n \n Black on Black Violence | PSJ\n \n \nIn one study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (covering reported violent crime that occurred between 1993-98) when the offender had been identified, 76% of the time the violence was intra-racial.\n\n \n Black-on-black violence is killing a part of the city\n \n \nNumbers tell part of the story. According to the most recent census figures, blacks make up 8.2 percent of Seattle's population and 5.7 percent of King County's population. But nearly a third of those booked into the King County jails for homicides are black.\n \n More than half of the 4,000 people from King County in the state prison system are black. Nationally, for every three black men in college, there are four in prison.\n\n \n Even your own comrade Galileo sold you out when he was trying to defend Chicago's handgun ban. \n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/425527-post26.html\n \n \nAs I understand, this basically says that Chicago's high murder rate has been been due to crack cocaine, poverty, and a large African American population.\n\n \n You talk about equal protection under the law in your rant as well Brady. Well I have a question for you. Are white people capable of being victims of racially motivate violence if they're attacked by people of a minority group? If two white boys are jumped and stomped on by a latino street gang were they attacked for racially motivated reasons? If not are you then willing to admit that minority individuals can be victims of violence without their race having anything to do with what happened?\n \n You also mention \"the laws that let people own guns\" but what laws are those Brady? Rather I think it's an absence of laws that prohibit gun ownership that you're referring to. And how exactly are blacks harmed by these laws? Under the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment aren't black people allowed to own guns just like anyone else? After all that was one of the historically recognized reasons that necessitated the passage of the 14th Amendment. During the time of freed slaves there were laws in the southern states that specifically spelled out that blacks weren't permitted to own or carry guns.\n \n Now if gun ownership is harmful to blacks, why did southern states have laws that specified blacks weren't allowed to own guns? Were these laws passed for their own defense to protect the blacks from angry whites who might kill them for daring to arm themselves?",

   "Thats the racist myth of black on black violence. You say it cant be the whites and must be the blacks or the mexicans doing the killings.\n \n Thinking that race turns people into criminals is just racist.\n\n I am somewhat stunned at the hypocrisy of just this.\n \n You make it an issue (when I say make I mean try to make) the race of the killers, when someone responds (incorrectly) that it is the same race, you call them racist for thinking that that race made them killers.\n \n I say the response was incorrect because it assumes your racist premises, those must be immediately discarded as soon as they are encountered.\n \n \"The victims are poor oppressed blacks. How many gun owners would suddenly change their minds about gun control if the victims were white?\"The number of gun owners who would change their mind about gun control based on race are the number of racist gun owners. NATO pointed this out on the next line at that was the perfect response IMO.\n \n \"Find out exactly who's doing the killing of blacks in California. Chances are it's other blacks or mexicans who have gang-related ties. This isn't an obvious example of white racist violence against minorities.\"\n This was obviously an attempt to show the underlined statement.\n \n That however is totally irrelevant because race is totally irrelevant. If it was an obvious example of white racist violence against minorities the response should be exactly the same. The key word is violence. Minorities are irrelevant, races are irrelevant, all collectives are irrelevant.\n \n Humanity is made of up individuals. Equality means each individual has the same rights.\n \n Those two statements work together to form one inviolate conclusion. All cases where morality (having to do with rights) are the issue are instantly exempted from accepting any collective (race is a genetic collective) as a relevant factor for doing so necessitates that rights are not equal for it implies that some property of the collective is altering the rights of any given individual.\n \n \nAlot more blacks are victimized by gun violence so they arent getting equal protection of the laws that let people own guns.\n\n and to drive my point home you commit the implied fallacy explicitly.\n \n So they aren't getting equal protection under the law because they are victimized and others aren't?\n \n Is that not true of the individual?\n \n Let's assume for a moment that gun laws are proper and would protect people from violence. Further I will take for my analogy that there is no law against robbery.\n \n Jane is rich, she get's robbed.\n \n Bob is not rich, he doesn't get robbed.\n \n Jane has unequal protection under the law because bob didn't get robbed but she did.\n \n Does this follow?\n \n Of course not, they are both subject to the same lack of law equally; but through circumstances having nothing to do with that law jane felt the damage from the lack of that law and bob did not.\n \n Again assuming gun laws are proper, blacks are receiving the same lack of protection as whites. It just matters more according to your statistics.\n \n This of course is the correction of the insane reversal you setup in which a law let people have guns, laws stop people from doing things letting is the default even in dictatorships.\n \n \nThese laws are having alot more negative effect on blacks than whites.\n\n Laws against stealing are having a lot more negative effect on thieves than on non-thieves.\n \n This should be perfectly obvious to you but just in case no body thought to mention it.\n \n A law cannot fail to meet the criteria that rights are equal among all men unless it differentiates between men in it's own words.\n \n Everything else is from a legal standpoint a coincidence.\n \n So to return to the point, what you are trying to do here is one of the most despicable collectivist power plays that exist commonly known as the 'race card', you bring up your meaningless classes; you make comments about the world based on those classes and then you go 'ah ha got you you racist' if your opponent responds in the same terms.\n \n I have had some of the most amusing times of my online life watching people try to get me to assume their absurd racial premises.\n \n They try to slip them in so subtly, often under the guise of a positive (positive racism by the way is 20 times more common than negative racism), often calling it by the names of 'proud of where you came from' or 'connected with his/her roots'.\n \n So, a little tip for you if by some off chance you don't actually want to be a racist; don't consider race unless it is relevant. It is relevant to morality about... never. A lynching is the murder of a person based on race, it is wrong based on a person being murdered.\n \n You can make every moral decision in your life while never being introduced to the concept of races, you are permitted to comment on the irrationality of it but you are guilty of it only when you apply it to a moral calculation.",

   "Summary of Rights, Powers and Duties:\n \n Constitutional Rights, Powers and Duties\n \n \nSummary of \n Constitutional Rights, Powers and Duties\n Discussions of rights are sometimes confused concerning what are and are not rights of the people or powers of government or the duties of each. This is an attempt to summarize the rights, powers, and duties recognized or established in the U.S. Constitution, in Common Law as it existed at the time the U.S. Constitution was adopted, or as implied therein. Not included are certain \"internal\" rights and powers that pertain to the various elements of government within each level with respect to each other.\n \n Personhood:[1]\n \"Persons\" are one of the two main classes which are the subject of rights, powers, and duties, the other being \"citizens\". Persons may be \"natural\" or \"corporate\". \"Citizens\" are a subclass of \"natural persons\". Only persons have standing as parties under due process. Each government has the power to define what is and is not a \"person\" within its jurisdiction, subject to certain restrictions of Common Law and the Constitution, the 15th Amendment to which requires that it not exclude anyone based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude. Under Common Law existing at the time of the adoption of the U.S. Constitution, \"natural personhood\" was considered to begin at natural birth and end with the cessation of the heartbeat. But technology has created a new situation, opening the way for statute or court decision to extend this definition and set the conditions under which personhood begins and ends.\n \n Each government may also establish, within its jurisdiction, \"corporate persons\" such as governmental entities, associations, corporations, or partnerships, in addition to the Common Law \"natural\" persons, but the \"personhood\" of such corporate entities is not created by the government. Its corporate personhood derives from the personhood of its members. Corporate persons must be aggregates of natural persons.\n \n Under Common Law, natural persons include only human beings, but provides a basis for inclusion of entities that are sufficiently like human beings in their behavior to be indistinguishable for legal purposes, such as aliens, androids, or genetically enhanced animals, which have interests, an ability to reason, and an ability to communicate. This would exclude, however, establishment of other things as persons, such as inanimate objects, which have no ability to represent themselves under due process. Inclusion of such inanimate objects as parties to civil due process, in effect making them \"persons\", has found its way into the U.S. legal system, unconstitutionally, through recent seizure/forfeiture statutes.\n \n Although not a well-developed area, there is also a basis for excluding entities which, although they are born to human beings, lack attributes which would enable them to be functionally human, such as some minimal level of cognitive capacity, but such beings must be considered natural persons as the default unless proven otherwise through due process.\n \n Citizenship:\n Citizenship is the attribute of persons who, as members of the polity, have certain privileges and duties in addition to those they have as persons. Citizens include those born on U.S. or State territory or naturalized according to law.\n \n Natural Rights:\n The classic definition of \"natural rights\" are \"life, liberty, and property\", but these need to be expanded somewhat. They are rights of \"personhood\", not \"citizenship\". These rights are not all equally basic, but form a hierarchy of derivation, with those listed later being generally derived from those listed earlier.\n \n Personal Security (Life):\n (1) Not to be killed.\n \n (2) Not to be injured or abused.\n \n Personal Liberty:\n (3) To move freely.\n \n (4) To assemble peaceably.\n \n (5) To keep and bear arms.[18]\n \n (6) To assemble in an independent

Non-natural rights of personhood, created by social contract:\n (1) To enter into contracts, and thereby acquire contractual rights, to secure the means to exercise the above natural rights.[1,15]\n \n (2) To enjoy equally the rights, privileges and protections of personhood as established by law.\n \n (3) To petition an official for redress of grievances and get action thereon in accordance with law, subject to the resources available thereto.\n \n (4) To petition a legislator and get consideration thereof, subject to resources available thereto.\n \n (5) To petition a court for redress of grievances and get a decision thereon, subject to resources available thereto.\n \n (6) Not to have one's natural rights individually disabled except through due process of law, which includes:\n \n (a) In criminal prosecutions:\n \n (1) Not to be charged for a major crime but by indictment by a Grand Jury, except while serving in the military, or while serving in the Militia during time of war or public danger.\n \n (2) Not to be charged more than once for the same offense.\n \n (3) Not to be compelled to testify against oneself.\n \n (4) Not to have excessive bail required.\n \n (5) To be tried by an impartial jury from the state and district in which the events took place.\n \n (6) To have a jury of at least six for a misdemeanor, and at least twelve for a felony.[1]\n \n (7) To a speedy trial.\n \n (8) To a public trial.\n \n (9) To have the assistance of counsel of one's choice.\n \n (10) To be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation.\n \n (11) To be confronted

punishment inflicted upon oneself.\n \n (b) In civil cases:\n \n (1) To trial by an impartial jury from the state and district in which the events took place[1] where the issue in question is either a natural right[1] or property worth more than $20.\n \n (2) In taking of one's property for public use, to be given just compensation therefor.\n \n (3) To have compulsory process for obtaining

the community and enforce the laws, subject to legal orders of higher-ranking officials.[17]\n \n (4) To receive militia training.[7]\n \n Disabilities of minority: [1]\n Certain of the above rights are restricted, or \"disabled\", for minors, but the definition of who is a minor and the extent to which each of these rights are disabled for minors, is limited to the jurisdiction over which each government has general legislative authority, which for the U.S. government, is \"federal ground\" (see below). Minors are the only class of persons whose rights may be disabled without a need to justify the disablement as arising from the need to resolve a conflict with the rights of others, either through statute or due process. The disablement consists of the assignment of a power to supervise the exercise of the rights under the headings of \"liberty\" and \"property\" listed above to a guardian, by default the parents, who acts as agent of the State for the purpose of nurturing the minor. The disability is normally removed by statute providing for removal when a certain age, such as 18, or condition, such as marriage, is attained. The disabilities of minority can also be removed earlier by court order or, if statute allows, extended beyond the usual statutory expiration by court order in cases of incompetence. The right to vote is not included among the disabilities of minority, but is defined separately by law, so that removal of the disabilities of minority does not in itself affect having the right to vote.\n \n Constitutional duties of persons under U.S. or State jurisdiction:[7]\n \n (1) To obey laws that are constitutional and applied within their proper jurisdiction and according to their

weapons which may be carried by one person and which might be useful or necessary to defend oneself or the community, except weapons of mass destruction such as bombs, heavy missiles or artillery, or biological, chemical, or nuclear agents which may cause lasting injury or death.\"\n \n (10) To make explicit that only natural persons or corporate persons composed of natural persons may be the subject of due process in any civil or criminal proceeding.\n \n NOTES:\n [1] This is established in Common Law at the time the U.S. Constitution was adopted, but is not explicit in the U.S. Constitution.\n \n [2] Originally, \"commerce\" meant only transfers of goods or services for a valuable consideration, so that \"interstate\" commerce would not include interstate migration, carrying across a state border of one's own possessions that one intends to keep, the sending across a state border of a gift or inheritance, nor include articles which had not yet crossed a state border, or articles which had \"come to rest\" with the completion of the transfer. It would not include manufacturing, local sales, or things that are \"part of an aggregate\" of interstate commerce, or things that might \"affect\" interstate commerce. Note also that the power to regulate does not include the power to criminally prosecute violations of regulations, but only to seize property through civil process.\n \n [3] These are the only provisions that allow federal criminal laws jurisdiction outside federal ground.\n \n [4] These powers, if not exercised by the State, revert to the people.\n \n [5] This provision would seem to forbid taxes on interstate commerce if export to another state of the U.S. is included, leaving only intrastate commerce or commerce on federal ground subject to excise taxes or duties, although interstate commerce can otherwise be regulated.\n \n [6] This means obeying constitutional laws and practices, and resisting unconstitutional ones.\n \n [7] This is not clearly stated, but implied.\n \n [8] The power to tax is not the power to regulate or license, and vice versa. That is why the powers to tax and to regulate are separately specified. With one exception, which is never used (in Art. 1 Sec. 10), no allowance is made for the charging of fees to cover the costs of regulation, even though this has become a common practice, in violation of the Constitution.\n \n [9] This use of the word \"Legislation\" is a term of art which grants general powers within its jurisdiction, including powers of criminal and civil law that a State might exercise within its jurisdiction, but unlike a State in that a State would be restricted by a state constitution granting it only certain powers. This is a major gap in the Constitution. Although it applies only to federal ground, it also does not make clear what are the limitations on such legislative power, other than the natural and constitutional rights of persons, and so has been interpreted to allow anything that does not violate those rights. There is a need for a federal sub-constitution, similar to a typical state constitution, that applies to federal ground.\n \n [10] The wording suggests that the States have the power, but allows the Congress to pre-empt it.\n \n [11] But this implies that if the State fails to appoint such officers, local militias are left to elect their own, which was the established Common Law practice at the time the U.S. Constitution was adopted. But \"according to the discipline prescribed by Congress\". This means Congress can direct, but not forbid it, and implies that, in the absence of any training conducted by the State, local militias are left to organize and train themselves, which was the established Common Law practice established at the time the U.S. Constitution was adopted. \n \n [12] The term used is \"form\" of government, but the Framers seem to have meant substance as well, and that is reasonably implied. \n \n [13] The original term was \"well-regulated\", but this is what was meant. Militias were originally local and independent of official authority, and it was intended that although they be subject to official authority when called into service by such authority, that they also be able to convene and operate independently when not.\n \n [14] \"Vehicle\" was not explicitly included, but implied as an \"effect\". \n \n [15] This is needed to allow persons not only to have rights but the means to exercise them, and also to acquire those means if they do not already have them, without which the right would be unduly burdened. However, beyond this right, the community has the general power to restrict contracts for reasons of public policy and not just to avoid conflicts with the rights of others, so that there is not a general \"right\" of contract, but a \"default privilege\" of doing so, subject to law, for contracts that do not involve securing the means to exercise their natural rights.\n \n [16] This is worded as \"to execute the Laws of the Union\", thus allowing States to also call forth their Militias to execute their own laws. \n \n [17] The exercise of general police powers is both a right of citizens, and a duty of able-bodied ones. All citizens are policemen, although ordinary citizens may be outranked by professional police officers when such officers are present in a law enforcement situation.\n \n [18] Likewise, the keeping and bearing of arms, while a right of persons, is also a duty of able-bodied citizens.\n \n FURTHER COMMENT:\n Note that there is no right to marry or bear children included among any of the rights listed above. It is not a \"natural\" right, because natural rights are only rights of individuals, and exercise of a \"right\" to marry, without the consent of the other, would be an assault. Since consent is required, it is a matter of contract, and contractual rights are created by the community, even if it is a \"community\" of only two persons. Since the community is normally a larger polity, and since all legal contracts are agreements not only between the contracting parties, but also with the entire community, therefore the community has the power to regulate marriage and childbirth, and has exercised that power since time immemorial, for the benefit of the community.\n \n Note also that the fundamental unit of the social contract is the local community or village. These may aggregate into a larger \"state\" or \"federal union\", but the basis is agreement among those who are in direct contact with one another.\n \n It is sometimes thought that \"the Constitution\" consists only of the written document. This is not so. The title \"The Constitution of the United States\" was added after the document was adopted, but \"constitution\" meant the \"basic legal order\", and the Constitution consists of both the written document and the common law at the time the document was adopted, which is here referred to as the Common Law in caps. Now, the written document does supersede the Common Law where they might be in conflict, but it does not replace it, and courts must refer to the Common Law for guidance where the written document is silent or ambiguous.\n \n In addition to the written document and the Common Law, the Constitution also includes Treaties, which, although they are valid only insofar as they are not in conflict with the written Constitution, are superior to both the Common Law and to State constitutions and laws, to the extent that those might be in conflict with the Treaties. Thus, some of the Treaties that have been adopted extend and clarify some of the rights, powers, and duties provided in the written Constitution. For example, that is how \"federal ground\" is extended to include coastal waters out to a certain distance from shore, and the grounds of U.S. embassies abroad, and how the rights of the people are amplified by the Charter of the United Nations and by various bilateral and multilateral Treaties that extend civil and commercial rights to U.S. citizens abroad.\n \n The following diagram can help clarify the relationship among the various elements of law in the U.S. legal system. Each element is superior to the one below it, although state constitutions are derived from their people, not from the U.S. Constitution. Although not shown, each box also includes the body of writings and recorded speeches of the legislators, diplomats, and judges who wrote the constitutions, treaties, laws, and court decisions, which clarify their intent, and which must be accepted as the basis of interpreting the words when there is confusion or dispute over their meaning. \n \n Constitution Society, 6900 San Pedro #147-230, San Antonio, TX 78216, 210/224-2868\n",

Of course they are legal gun owners because the second amendment made it legal for whites to have guns. Watch this presentation about US history by Moore on Oprah. \n YouTube - The Making of America\n\n \n Yes Brady, I agree that gun control has a very racist and shameful past in America. You have only briefly mentioned one example of discrimination involving the RKBA based upon race. I tell you that there are no less than three different racial minorities that have been discriminated against and, for purposes of this blog site, have been denied their RKBA as a pretext for \"controlling\" them....\n \n 1. African Americans\n \n After slavery was abolished by the Thirteenth Amendment, many southern states began enacting new ordinances, often referred to as \"black codes,\" in which blacks were denied the right to keep and bear arms in an attempt to preserve de facto slavery. Here are just two examples....\n \n In the State of Kentucky:\n \n \"the civil law prohibits the colored man from bearing arms. . .their arms are taken from them by the civil authorities. . . .Thus, the right of the people to keep and bear arms as provided in the Constitution is infringed. . . .\" Executive Document #30, 39th. Congress, 1st. Session, part 1, pp. 233 and 236 (1866) (from the Report of the Commissioner of the Freedmen's Bureau)\n \n And in Mississippi, a law entitled an \"Act to Regulate the Relation of Master and Apprentice Relative to Freedmen, Free Negroes, and Mulattoes.\" This act stated:\n \n \"That no freedman, free negro or mulatto. . .not licensed to do so by the board of police of his or her county, shall keep or carry fire-arms of any kind, or any ammunition, dirk or bowie knife. . .\" Laws of Mississippi, 1865, p. 165 (November 29, 1865).\n \n Commenting on this particular statute, one author noted that:\n \n \"This is a fair sample of the legislation subsequently passed by all the \"States\" reconstructed under President Johnson's plan. . . .The Northern Republicans professed to see this new legislation at the South the virtual re-enslavement of the negroes.\" J. Burgess, Reconstruction and the Constitution, 1866-1876, p. 51-52 (1902).\n \n Unfortunately, those who sought to continue de facto slavery did not limit themselves to the mere passage of laws. As noted by one Northern Senator:\n \n \"In Mississippi rebel State forces, men who were in the rebel armies, are traversing the State, visiting the freedmen, disarming them, perpetrating murders and outrages on them. . . .\"--Henry Wilson (Republican-Massachusetts Congressional Globe, 39th. Congress, 1st. Session, part 1, at p. 40 (December 13, 1865) \n \n Another Senator noted that the Mississippi state militia would roam throughout the state and habitually \"hang some freedmen or search negro houses for arms.\"--Lyman Trumball (Republican-Illinois) Congressional Globe, 39th. Congress, 1st. Session, part 1, Senate Report Number 30, p. 813 (February 13, 1866)\n \n (As an aside, let me ask everyone this: Is there anyone left here who still favors the \"militia service only\" interpretation of the 2nd. Amendment? If so, then do you believe that the 2nd. Amendment should have only guaranteed the black man a right to enroll in and carry arms in the state militia-that in Mississippi, for example, the black man's RKBA was limited to enrolling in the state militia so he too could carry arms while riding around looking to \"hang some freedmen or search negro houses for arms\"?) \n \n All of this ultimately led to the 14th. Amendment-the intent of which, as its most ardent Senate sponsor stated, was as follows:\n \n \"To these privileges and immunities should be added the personal rights guaranteed and secured by the first eight amendments of the Constitution; such as the freedom of speech and of the press; the right of the people peaceably to assemble and petition the Government for a redress of grievances, a right appertaining to each and all the people; the right to keep and to bear arms; the right to be exempted from the quartering of soldiers in a house without the consent of the owner; the right to be exempt from unreasonable searches and seizures, and from any search or seizure except by virtue of a warrant issued upon a formal oath or affidavit; the right of an accused person to be informed of the nature of the accusation against him, and his right to be tried by an impartial jury of the vicinage; and also the right to be secure against excessive bail and against cruel and unusual punishments.. . .(A)ll these immunities, privileges, rights, thus guaranteed by the Constitution or recognized by it, are secured to the citizens solely as a citizen of the United States and as a party in their courts. They do not operate in the slightest degree as a restraint or prohibition upon State legislation. . . .The great object of the first section of this amendment is, therefore, to restrain the power of the States and compel them at all times to respect these great fundamental guarantees...\"Congressional Globe, 39th. Congress, 1st. Session, part 3, p. 2765 (May 23, 1866) (Speech of Senator Jacob M. Howard (Republican-Michigan)) Note this quote was also cited by Justices Black and Duncan in their concurring opinion in Duncan v. LOUISIANA, 391 U.S. 145, 167 (1968), which held that the 14th. Amendment required the states to honor a defendant's 6th. Amendment right to trial by jury in criminal cases.\n \n And, as I have argued before, this was the widely understood purpose of the Amendment:\n \n \"In the entire Senate debate on the Fourteenth Amendment, running from May 23 to June 8, not a single senator challenged Senator Howard's declaration that Section 1 made the first eight amendments enforceable against the states.\" Irving Bryant, The Bill of Rights, p. 337 (1965).\n \n 2. Native Americans\n \n Native Americans also suffered the denial of their RKBA as a means to the end of \"controlling\" them. Consider the following:\n \n \"The Army's campaign against the \"hostiles\" led to Sitting Bull's notable victory over Custer's forces at the battle of the Little Big Horn on June 25. That victory, of course, was short-lived, and those Indians who surrendered to the Army were returned to the reservation, and deprived of their weapons and horses, leaving them completely dependent for survival on rations provided them by the Government.\" United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians, 448 U.S. 371, 379 (1980)\n \n Additionally, in 1873 Congress passed a law prohibiting the sale of arms and ammunition to \"hostile\" Indians. 17 Stat. 457, 42d Cong., 3d Sess., ch. 138 (1873). In fact, the federal government's special restrictions on selling firearms to native Americans were not finally abolished until 1979. Washington Post, 6 Jan. 1979, \u00a7A, at 11, col. 1.\n \n 3. Japanese Americans\n \n And from another dark part of our nation's past, here are a few excerpts from the \"FINAL REPORT: JAPANESE EVACUATION FROM THE WEST COAST 1942\" by commanding officer Lt. General J.L. DeWitt... \n \n Lt. Gen. John L. DeWitt's Final Report on the Evacuation of the Japanese - 1943\n \n \"On December 7 and 8th, 1941, the President issued proclamations declaring all nationals and subjects of the nations with which we were at war to be enemy aliens. This followed the precedent of the last war, and was based upon the same statutory enactment which supported the proclamations of President Wilson in this regard. (See 50 U.S.C. 21.) By executive action, certain restrictive measures were applied against all enemy aliens on an equal basis. In continental United States, the Attorney General, through the Department of Justice, was charged with the enforcement and administration of these proclamations. Where necessary fully to implement his action, the Attorney General was assigned to responsibility of issuing administrative regulations. He was also give the authority to declare prohibited zones, to which enemy aliens were denied admittance or from which they were to be excluded in any case where the national security required. The possession of certain articles was declared by the proclamations to be unlawful, and these articles are described as contraband. Authority was granted for the internment of such enemy aliens as might be regarded by the Attorney General as dangerous to the national security if permitted to remain at large. In continental United States internment was left in any case to the discretion of the Attorney General.\" \n \n Note that by \"contraband\" they meant items like short wave radios and, for purposes of this blog site, firearms. Note next the justification for restricting the civil liberties (including the RKBA) of all Japanese Americans for no reason other than race:\n \n \"Because of the ties of race, the intense feeling of filial piety and the strong bonds of common tradition, culture and customs, this population presented a tightly-knit racial group. It included in excess of 115,000 persons deployed along the Pacific Coast. Whether by design or accident, virtually always their communities were adjacent to very vital shore installations, war plants, etc. While it is believed that some were loyal, it was known that many were not. It was impossible to establish the identity of the loyal and the disloyal with any degree of safety. It was not there was insufficient time in which to make such a determination; it was simply a matter of facing the realities that a positive determination could not be made, that an exact separation of the \"sheep from the goats\" was unfeasible.\" \n \n And an excerpt dealing with early pre-internment attempts to deny the RKBA:\n \n \"The enforcement of the contraband provisions was impeded by the fact that many Japanese aliens resided in premises owned by American-born person of Japanese ancestry. The Department of Justice had agreed to authorize its special field agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to undertake spot raids without warrant to determine the possession of arms, cameras and other contraband by Japanese, but only in those premises occupied exclusively by enemy aliens. The search of mixed occupancy premises or dwellings had not been authorized except by warrant only.\" (emphasis added by me)\n \n What is most troubling (to me, at least) is none of this was attempted in secret. The denial of civil liberties (including the RKBA) to Japanese-Americans-which began before large scale internment started-was not something kept hidden to be later discovered by a shocked and outraged public, but was instead openly proclaimed and accepted by the majority of society. See, for example, the following (as printed in the The San Francisco News March 24, 1942): \n \n Japanese Internment - New Rigid Curfew Regulations for Japanese - 1942\n \n \nENEMY ALIEN CURFEW FRIDAY \n German, Japs, Italians In New Restrictions \n ________________________________________\n All enemy aliens and Japanese-Americans in the western halves of California, Oregon and Washington and in the southern half of Arizona will be placed under rigid new curfew regulations Friday, and any violators will be \"immediately punished.\" \n Announced by Lieut. Gen. John L. DeWitt, commander of the Western Defense Command, the order is intended to facilitate enforcement of measures against sabotage and fifth column activity. \n It was contained in the third public proclamation by General DeWitt since the war started. \n Extends Arms Ban \n The proclamation also extended the ban on possession of firearms, war materials, short-wave radio receiving and transmitting sets and other contraband to Japanese-Americans. Enemy aliens already had been forbidden to have such articles. \n The new regulations superseded those ordered for certain areas last January by Atty. Gen. Francis Biddle. Curfew exemptions granted by United States attorneys were revoked, effective Friday. \n Under the new edict Japanese, German and Italian aliens and Japanese-Americans must remain at home between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m.\n Persons affected may not travel more than five miles from their homes except to settle their affairs at wartime civilian control offices. Under a law approved by President Roosevelt last week violators face penalties of a $5000 fine or one year's imprisonment or both. \n Will Be Enforced \n Warning that the curfew would be enforced \"rigidly,\" General DeWitt said:\n \"Military necessity dictates such action and military necessity requires strictest enforcement. As a patriotic duty, each citizen is urged to report without delay to local authorities or the FBI any violation he may observe.\" \n The proclamation was expected to speed evacuation of strategic areas. Reception centers for evacuees have been established at Manzanar, Cal., in Owens Valley, and near Blythe, Cal., in the Colorado River Valley. The War Relocation Authority announced plans yesterday to place 20,000 Japanese on the Colorado River Indian Reservation at Parker, Ariz. \n Governor E.P. Carville of Nevada echoed the reception given the Northwestern Japanese colony proposal when he announced yesterday: \"If Japanese evacuees come into Nevada they will go into concentration camps.\" \n \n\n \n Now look, Brady. We have almost found something to agree upon. Are you ready to stop watching Oprah and accept my offers yet?\n \n ---\n \n \"For those who can possess and wield arms are in a position to decide whether the constitution is to continue or not.\" Aristotle, Politics, T. Sinclair Trans. 1962, p. 274.",

   "Well at least now we know Brady really can respond to questions and criticism. He just chooses not to when he doesn't feel like getting slammed. I guess that explains why Bryan's challenges have gone unanswered.\n \n \nWell white gun owners have a long history of victimizing blacks and minority groups.\n\n \n How exactly do \"white gun owners\" have a long history of victimizing blacks and minority groups? Explain that to me since you seem to be the expert on the matter. How is it white gun owners have victimized others? Why is it blacks and minority groups were unable to resist and fight back in an equal manner? Could it be because at the time there were laws in place that barred non-whites from taking up arms for any reason? \n \n In other words wasn't gun control exercised for racist ideals and purposes? Laws serving to disarm those considered dissidents from the public and thus making them easier to violate and kill. How exactly can you make the claim that gun control somehow isn't racist when your own example shows that it was? After all there had to be a reason blacks and minorities weren't armed if they were getting victimized. And it sure as hell wasn't their good nature and religious objection that prevented them from taking up arms for their own defense.\n \n \nOf course they are legal gun owners because the second amendment made it legal for whites to have guns. Watch this presentation about US history by Moore on Oprah.\n\n \n It wasn't the Second Amendment that made it legal for whites to own guns. It was the government that made it illegal for non-whites to own guns. So therefore you have Moore proving our case and showing that gun control was used for racist ideals.\n \n You hung yourself on that one Brady.",

Of course they are legal gun owners because the second amendment made it legal for whites to have guns. Watch this presentation about US history by Moore on Oprah. \n YouTube - The Making of America\n\n Yes Brady.\n \n   Institute for Justice -- 14th Amendment \n 2. The history and adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment demonstrates the Framer's specific and repeated concern that freedmen were being disarmed by state and local governments and militias, in violation of what those Framers understood to be an individual constitutional right to bear arms. In response to this Court's previous refusal to enforce parts of the Bill of Rights directly against the States, and its holding that blacks were not citizens of the United States entitled to the rights of such citizens, the Framers set out to remedy the inability to enforce numerous constitutional rights against the States by incorporating them into the Fourteenth Amendment. Identification of the evils the 39th Congress sought to remedy - including the disarming of freedmen - the parallel legislative responses to that problem, and the specific explanations by the Framers of the purpose and function of the Fourteenth Amendment, all demonstrate that they viewed the existing constitutional right to bear arms as an individual right of personal security. And they understood and intended the language of the Fourteenth Amendment to secure such a right against the States and various militias, not merely in the service of the very entities seeking to disarm and abuse the freedmen. And by accomplishing that goal through the identification and extension of the rights of national citizens, the Framers of the Fourteenth Amendment also clarified and defined the underlying rights in the Second Amendment as well.\n \n Whatever the basis for incorporation, however, the history of the Fourteenth Amendment shows that the right to bear arms was intended to be incorporated, and thus should be read as it was understood at the time of such incorporation. \n\n \n But Brady, you forgot the word some whites. A small sum at that. Otherwise how would you explain the proposal of, the passage of, and ratification of the 13th and and 14th Amendments? emoticon_smile Oooooor did it just happen by magic? emoticon_ic\n \n When did women get the right to vote? \n \nUS: August 18, 1920: the 19th amendment giving women the right to vote was passed. On August 26, 1920, when the 19th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States was ratified. Women in general were allowed to vote in local elections from 1910. \n \n \n Tell us Brady, does the information that While Males ratified the 13th and 14th put a twist in your knickers? emoticon_smile",

   "Two things that I felt were worth pointing out the inaccuracies of Brady's current position on affirmative action.\n \n Firstly since Obama won the 2008 presidential race I don't think we need any further affirmative action since he reached the highest position in the country possible for anyone.\n \n Secondly there's the case of Ricci v DeStafano in which the Supreme Court basically ruled against affirmative action. Ricci Vs. DeStefano - Forbes.com\n \n \nMonday's decision of the United States Supreme Court in the New Haven Firefighter's affirmative action case, Ricci v. DeStefano reveals an open wound on affirmative action by public bodies that time has not healed. As a technical matter, the case arose in a somewhat unusual posture, so I will take the liberty of writing a longer piece than normal. Apologies in advance.\n \n The city of New Haven went to great lengths to devise a written examination that would fairly test members of the New Haven firefighters for promotion to captain and lieutenant. But ultimately, the results on this test, like the results on so many other qualification tests, generated a sharp disparate impact. African-American and Hispanic applicants did far worse than the white candidates for the open positions, such that none of them would have been eligible for consideration in the first wave of promotions. Black and Hispanic applicants threatened to sue the city to invalidate the test because of that disparate impact. The city decided, in effect, to settle that case without litigation by abandoning its tests and refusing to certify any successful candidates for promotion.\n \n That decision did not bring peace. The disappointed white firefighters then went to court themselves, claiming that the city had no reason to set aside the test, which had been fairly vetted and properly administered. The Supreme Court, by a predictable five to four vote that broke along conservative and liberal lines, upheld the validity of the test. Justice Kennedy wrote the Court's opinion, and Justices Scalia and Alito concurred. Justice Ginsburg wrote a dissent\n \n I have little doubt that under the current law, the conservative majority got this case correct under Title VII. The relevant legal analysis calls for a three-step test. The first, and uncontroversial, conclusion was that the African-American and Hispanic firefighters could show that the test had a disparate impact. That finding, however, does not end the matter, but only shifts the burden to the city to defend the test on the ground of \"business necessity,\" by which is meant that it was a device that the city had to use in order to sort out those firefighters who were properly eligible for promotion from those who were not. On this score, the city did well. The test preparations were meticulous, and if the elaborate precautions taken to root out all potential forms of bias were insufficient, then the business necessity defense was a dead letter.\n \n So this moved the question to the third stage, which is whether there was some alternative means that could have achieved the same result without the discriminatory impact. Again, the only way to make this case out would be to claim that all these tests, no matter how constructed, are not job-related so that promotions should turn on subjective intangibles. The frequency with which tests are used in all areas of life (including many employment contexts, like professional sports, where there is no disparate impact problem) suggests the foolishness of this approach.\n \n Government bodies and private employers both need reliable information in order to make intelligent decisions on promotion, and it would be a scandal if Title VII were to remove one core component of any employment decisions. If the disappointed applicants could have proposed their own alternative test, that would have had both predictive power and no disparate impact, there is room for a discussion on the point. But one of the least appealing features of the current law on testing in race cases is that the attackers of the result do not have to present that alternative. And it is not likely, given the long history of failed attempts, that they would be able to do so. The defenders of affirmative action do us no favor when they attack the validity of tests that are now so carefully engineered that major improvements seem unlikely.\n",

   "So if you really want to correct wrongs against blacks then here is an idea. White people should pay a $100 tax on every gun they buy and a $50 tax on every bullet. Black people will pay no taxes and get a 90% discount on every gun they buy. Its like affirmmative action for guns. Lets see if your willing to practice what you preach or if your just dancing in the blood of victims of racism.\n\n \n OK Brady, I'll take you up on your topic. I don't fully understand your desire to sacrifice the fundamental right of equal protection as a means to infringing the fundamental RKBA, but I do wish to challenge the constitutionality of your proposed law. I believe your law cannot survive my constitutional challenge. Here is why....\n \n For starters, you should be made aware that SCOTUS believes there are:\n \n \"three general propositions with respect to governmental racial classifications. First, skepticism: \"'Any preference based on racial or ethnic criteria must necessarily receive a most searching examination,'\" Wygant, 476 U.S., at 273 (plurality opinion of Powell, J.); Fullilove, 448 U.S., at 491 (opinion of Burger, C. J.); see also id., at 523 (Stewart, J., dissenting) (\"[A]ny official action that treats a person differently on account of his race or ethnic origin is inherently suspect\"); McLaughlin, 379 U.S., at 192 (\"[R]acial classifications [are] 'constitutionally suspect'\"); Hirabayashi, 320 U.S., at 100 (\"Distinctions [Page 224] between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people\"). Second, consistency: \"[T]he standard of review under the Equal Protection Clause is not dependent on the race of those burdened or benefited by a particular classification,\" Croson, 488 U.S., at 494 (plurality opinion); id., at 520 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment); see also Bakke, 438 U.S., at 289-290 (opinion of Powell, J.), i.e., all racial classifications reviewable under the Equal Protection Clause must be strictly scrutinized. And third, congruence: \"Equal protection analysis in the Fifth Amendment area is the same as that under the Fourteenth Amendment,\" Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S., at 93; see also Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S., at 638, n. 2; Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S., at 500. Taken together, these three propositions lead to the conclusion that any person, of whatever race, has the right to demand that any governmental actor subject to the Constitution justify any racial classification subjecting that person to unequal treatment under the strictest judicial scrutiny.\" Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 223-224 (1995)\n \n And so, Brady, you now must be prepared to deal with:\n \n \"(A) core premise of strict scrutiny - namely, that the heavy burden of justification is on the State.\" Burson v. Freeman, 504 U.S. 191, 226 (1992) (Stevens, dissenting) (emphasis in original)\n \n What is that burden you must meet? First, Brady, you must establish that a \"compelling state interest\" is at stake in your proposed law:\n \n \"When such vital individual rights are at stake, a State must establish that its classification is necessary to serve a compelling interest. American Party of Texas v. White, 415 U.S. 767, 780-781 (1974); Storer v. Brown, 415 U.S. 724, 736 (1974); Williams v. Rhodes, supra, at 31.\" Illinois Elections Bd. v. Socialists Workers Party, 440 U.S. 173, 184 (1979)\n \n And, Brady, in pursing that \"compelling interest,\" you must also meet your:\n \n \"heavy burden of proving that (you have) selected a means of pursuing a compelling state interest which does not impinge unnecessarily on constitutionally protected interests.\" Attorney General of N. Y. v. Soto-Lopez, 476 U.S. 898, 911 (1986)\n \n Or, to put it another way, Brady:\n \n \"In pursuing that important interest, (you) cannot choose means that unnecessarily burden or restrict constitutionally protected activity. Statutes affecting constitutional rights must be drawn with \"precision,\" NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 438 (1963); United States v.

   "Now, as to this Quote \"Gun owners\" are raciest stuff. I believe Doc said he was African American, and my wife is Filipino, what does that make our children? Am I supposed to hate them or something?\n \n My wife and I have many Filipino friends and most of them are gun owners. Many Filipinos are married to whites, some blacks, and are, in fact, gun owners. It is also a fact that most of my gun owning friends are either Black, Filipino, or whites married to Filipinos. Do we all have to hate our children or something because we are gun owners? I am 63 and that makes most of the children of our peer group grown, and some, if not most, are gun owners too. How is that supposed to work. Who are the black, Filipino and the half Filipino gun owners supposed to hate? What kind of schizophrenic nightmare do you fantasize about us? \n \n My wife is a gun owner, and I know that before she purchased her guns, she didn't fill out a I am raciest and I am a hater form or nothing. Tell us, in your fantastic world, was she supposed to do that?\n \n How about the racial minority cops, and military men and women? When they were issued guns or had to buy them, did they somehow become racist on the spot, or something? So tell us, in your fantasy world, how is all of that supposed to work? Because that is surly not the reality we know.\n \n And if none of this is true, which it Ain't, what does that make you?\n\n It makes it easy to disprove the racism of gun owning in general, but even if every gun owner was 'white' it would not prove that owning a gun is racist. That is important to remember, I often find people listing off observed diversity as a counter to accusation of racism; while this is effective it permits by assumption the necessity of diversity to prove the absence of racism and that is incorrect.\n \n Just because everyone who works at company A is 'black' does not mean it is a racist company.\n \n Merely treating race as a relevant factor as racist do causes one to share some of their irrationality.\n \n If someone tried to quantify the world as either reese's lovers or harry potter fans and the harry potter fans are oppressing the reese's lovers or that harry potter fans are inferior you would hardly respond 'no I know many people who like harry potter and reese's' or 'I know many smart harry potter fans'. You would attack the insane proposition at the source, namely the idea that any pertinent distinction exists i.e. that the classes chosen are entirely arbitrary and meaningless.\n \n \nTwo things that I felt were worth pointing out the inaccuracies of Brady's current position on affirmative action.\n \n Firstly since Obama won the 2008 presidential race I don't think we need any further affirmative action since he reached the highest position in the country possible for anyone.\n \n\n No affirmative action was required the moment it entered someones mind.",

Although some could argue the case that's not the point I'm trying to make.\n \n What I'm saying is that because of Obama winning the presidential election I believe that qualifies as evidence that the affirmative action program is no longer necessary. Since Obama was the black candidate and he was elected that means he (most likely) won the job because America felt he was best qualified to do the job. That means he won on qualifications alone rather than simply being the black man in a white office race.\n \n Now if Obama could be elected president based on his qualifications alone then I suggest that means we no longer need to give preferential treatment to blacks and minorities when it comes to hiring considerations, and instead switch back to job qualifications exclusively. If someone doesn't get the job it's because they couldn't meet the requirements rather than because there wasn't enough color and diversity in the office and they were trying to avoid a lawsuit.",

I think most of the populous, perhaps over 70% of voters didn't care, but those who did were almost entirely his constituents, i.e. people who voted for him for a multitude of reasons but among them race. Either because they thought it was some kind of redemption to American pride to do so, an apology for slavery if you will or because they thought of him as 'one of theirs' based on genetic similarities. Running for president is close most of the time and I have no doubt that this mattered in a significant way.\n \n but let me clarify, I was not refering to affirmative action by voters, I was refering to all affirmative action everywhere. You say 'no longer necessary' which implies you think it once was.\n \n \nNow if Obama could be elected president based on his qualifications alone then I suggest that means we no longer need to give preferential treatment to blacks and minorities when it comes to hiring considerations\n\n We never did, no inequality ought to exist in law or morality.\n \n \nand instead switch back to job qualifications exclusively.\n\n Any sane moral person would never have had other criteria for hiring someone, but the world is not made of entirely of sane moral people; that does not mean anyone has the right to force people to hire other people.\n \n Even if someone plainly stated that they were denying someone a job based on race I would not interfere. The principle of such interference would necessarily be 'He is behaving irrationally, so I have the right to modify that behavior with force'.\n \n Racism isn't the only irrationality, and besides the fact that such a principle is totally irreconcilable with liberty it could hardly be applied consistently without setting up a police state.\n \n e.g. employers aren't allowed to hire anyone who isn't good at the job, employers aren't allowed to hire anyone because of family bonds, employees may never get bonuses unless they deserve them.\n \n These are all things we can support in the general but it is simply wrong to pretend that the individual decisions belong to anyone but the individuals involved.\n \n \nIf someone doesn't get the job it's because they couldn't meet the requirements rather than because there wasn't enough color and diversity in the office and they were trying to avoid a lawsuit.\n\n Or perhaps because of their politics, or personality, or age, or gender, or favourite food, or whether they had a sense of style or any number of a million other irrelevancies which we could not easily single out nor morally do anything about anyway.\n \n We can require that people do not violate other people's rights, but since no one has a right to any particular job; we can only recommend that people make hiring decisions on solid logic.",

I've heard that Harvard Law School is notoriously difficult to get into.\n\n \n The man graduated magna cum laude and was the president of the Harvard Law Review. You may not agree with him politically, but there is every chance he was smart enough to get in.\n \n \n That said, Brady's argument is NUTS!\n \n I live in a predominently black inner city neighborhood. I do believe that most of the guns that circulate here were stolen. But the people to blame for that are the THEIVES not law abiding gun-owners.\n \n To those who don't understand why crime stats are being viewed with race in mind you are also NUTS. Violence in black city communities is a huge problem. Young men are being killed at an alarming rate. Its a trajedy no matter what way you look at it.\n \n Some of victims are involved in crime. Some are just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Good kids die in my neighborhood along with the thugs every year.\n \n Even the fact that there are thugs is heart breaking. There are far too many young people in poor communities who have parents who either don't care or are working so many hours to get by they don't know whats going on. Homeless, uncared for adolescents are going to accept whoever will accept them. All too often, that is a gang. I am currently doing what I can to help out a kid on my son's basketball team who is homeless half the time. His father is absent and out of state. Mothers home is abusive and he is frequently thrown out. His sister who has custody of him is in another city and doing nothing. His other sister let him stay awhile but charged him rent.\n \n And there is little recourse. All he wants is to get through school, but he has been in trouble a few times as frequently teens don't know any better, and they never learn if there is nobody to tell them so. They can't work more than a few hours a week due to child labor laws and they can not sign a lease. And yet I learned the hard way that child protection will not do anything for 16 and 17 year olds. There are precious few shelters and programs to help them (48 beds in the Twin Cities to serve just shy of 1000 homeless youth at any given time). \n \n Another problem is drugs. Most crime is around drugs. Legalize the XXXX. Currently there is a demand being met by criminals. Didn't prohibition teach us anything?",

   "Washington, DC--Missouri leads the nation in the rate of black homicide victimization according to a new analysis of unpublished Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Supplementary Homicide Report (SHR) data released today by the Violence Policy Center (VPC). \n \n The annual study, &#8220;Black Homicide Victimization in the United States: An Analysis of 2008 Homicide Data,&#8221; (http://www.vpc.org/studies/blackhomicide11.pdf) uses 2008 data--the most recent data available from the FBI--and ranks the 50 states according to their black homicide victimization rates. The study found overwhelmingly that firearms, usually handguns, were the weapon of choice in the homicides. \n \n The top five states with each state's corresponding black homicide victimization rate are: \n \n 1) Missouri, 39.90 per 100,000; \n 2) Pennsylvania, 31.05 per 100,000; \n 3) Indiana, 28.71 per 100,000; \n 4) Michigan, 24.50 per 100,000; and, \n 5) Tennessee, 22.59 per 100,000. \n \n Josh Sugarmann, VPC executive director and study co-author states, \"While Missouri has the highest rate of black homicide victimization, across the nation this is a long-ignored crisis that is devastating black teens and adults.\" \n \n For MISSOURI, the study found that in 2008: \n \n There were 287 black homicide victims, resulting in a homicide rate of 39.90 per 100,000. Of these, 246 were male and 41 were female. \n \n \n For homicides in which the weapon used could be identified, 87 percent of black victims (237 out of 273) were killed with guns. Of these, 50 percent (118 victims) were known to be killed with handguns. There were 108 victims killed with firearms where the type of gun was not stated. There were 21 victims killed with knives or other cutting instruments, three victims killed by bodily force, and nine victims killed by a blunt object. \n VPC - Press Release - (01/26/2011) - Missouri Leads Nation in Black Homicide Victimization\n\n \n I haven't read the whole thread so forgive me if I'm being redundant but has anyone pointed out that these murders were overwhelmingly, if not all black on black crimes? Also, if most if not all of the guns used in these murders were illegally obtained by the shooters, how can the establishment which has laws for legally obtaining weapons in place, be blamed for these deaths? \n \n Why don't any of your arguments leave room for personal responsibility on the part of the offenders in them, at all? Why do you always blame the establishment when we have 22,000 active gun laws on the books which need only be enforced in order for these statistics to be improved? Remember Brady, if you ban guns for everyone, only honest people will turn them in. The criminals will only be armed, then.",
