   "It's absolutely clear for everyone in Europe that Ukraine has never decided to wage gas war against the greatest suppler of gas in the world - Russia - without US all-round political support (which Yuschenko obtained during CIA Director's last visit to Ukraine not long ago). It is also clear that Washington runs its business, directed to break-down of the whole Russian gas infrastructure on the territory of former CIS countries. But is it so suitable for Europeans? I think USA hopes that soon Chinese begin to reclaim Siberian land with its rich natural resources. But there is no doubt that they will use gas and oil of Siberia only for their own hand whereas Europe will get the kick.",
