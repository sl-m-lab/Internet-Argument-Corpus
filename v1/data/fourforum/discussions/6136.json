   "What I think is ironic when gay rights people point out and/or praise vocal Christian gays is that they really stab these very same Christians in the back everytime they say hateful things about religion in general (usually Christianity), or make comments about how awful religion is, or generalize fundamentalists to Christians overall. It seems to me that anyone who takes any given opportunity to say something negative about Christianity has no business trying to invoke Christians for political gain if there's an opportunity to do that.\n \n One could also point out that there is another group of Christian gays out there who disagree with the gay lobby's position. This group of Christian gays would be those who are constantly verbally assaulted by the gay lobby for saying they are trying to live against their homosexual desires, and are trying to change (or much worse, HAVE changed). It seems that gay rights people are really only interested in \"Christian gays\" if they happen to agree with them politically.\n \n What gay lobbyists don't understand about many Christian gays is that by being Christian in the first place, they understand they are Christian first, and gay second. That same thing applies to Christians period, with any issue they are wrestling with in their life.",

   "Regardless of the fact there are alternative views out there that are trying to engage in revisionist Biblical interpretation about homosexual behavior because it's more PC to do it that way, the main accepted interpretation by most Biblical scholars is that the Bible does consider it a sin. And it has been the scholarly agreed-upon interpretation for 2 millenia. It's the most ridiulous uphill battle to try and make the Bible say something different that it so clearly says. Essentially the people who claim this fall back on the typical revisionist tactics of claiming it's all a matter of \"translation errors\" or saying the Hebrew or Greek can be read more than one way (ignoring the fact that the context clearly supports the mainline interpretation). This sort of hermeneutical gymnastics is the equivilent of taking a coat hanger and insisting it's not a coat hanger but really a tv antenna, and when told it's not, twisting the coat hanger up into the rough shape of a tv antenna and saying \"see, I told you so--it's a tv antenna!\" Sure, it can be reshaped into that, but it's still really a coat hanger. Frankly, it would make a lot more sense for these revisionists to simply disagree with the Bible rather than try and convince all of Christendom that it doesn't say what it clearly says. That tactic simply is never going to work.\n \n The common and time-honored interpretation of the Bible regarding homosexual behavior is well summed up here: (http://reformedonline.com/view/reformedonline/homosex.htm)\n\n \n I think the verses in the Bible about homosexuality are referring to heterosexuals. Homosexuals would be sinning if they engaged in heterosexual sex. I don't think it's right to go against God and call yourself a Christian. It's obvious that God created homosexuals. The verses in the Bible were not for homosexuals because THE ANCEINTS DID NOT CONSIDER THEM MALES. The ancients called homosexuals and castrated males, eunuchs. There were also eunuchs who refused to engage in any sexual acts to save themselves for the kingdom. Actually, homosexuals were the first ones who were called, eunuchs. There were also various gender distinctions among the ancients. Homosexuals(Eunuchs) were not considered males because they did not procreate. In the 4th century, the Catholic church began to take away homosexuals rights. They had also began to define maleness as anyone with a penis. They introduced laws outlawing homosexual sex and the \"closet\" was constructed. Prior to the 4th century, homosexuals had power because they served as priest in pagan temples and served as assistants to royal families.",

I think he should learn the history of ancient Rome, Africa, and various other civilizations. That dude is using the same argument people had used to enslave some of my ancestors. Now many of those ignorant fools are free from their oppression and they have decided to join folks like you to hate me. Again, the homsexual texts in the Bible is for heterosexuals to follow.",

If the bible is any indication of a Chrisitians position towards homosexuals- BushAlltheWay is correct. Further more you only need to examine the huge power of the religious right in our adminstration to know their position.",
