   "I never got a reply from you guys on this one...\n \n Matthew 5:\n \n \"17 \u00b6 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.\n 18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.\n 19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.\"\n \n Jesus said that. so there's my quote from Jesus. \n \n Thistown, I'll take your Matt. 5:38 citation. The Pharisees had taken the old judicial rule, \"eye for an eye, tooth for tooth, etc.\" is found in Exodus 21:24, Leviticus 24:20, and Deuteronomy 19:21, and turned it into a rule for personal revenge, which is clearly wrong, and which Jesus condemns here. The original purpose of that law, was to be an admonision to the judges to be just, but also to limit them in the extent of their punishment. This rule meant you couldn't kill someone for stealing. The punishment had to be proportional to the crime committed. All the commentaries I have read on this affirmhat it is NOT unjust, or unbiblical, as a judicial rule. Matthew Henry says:\n \n ...they may not insist on a greater punishment than is proper: it is not a life for an eye, nor a limb for a tooth, but observe a proportion; and it is intimated (Nu 35:31), that the forfeiture in this case might be redeemed with money; for when it is provided that no ransom shall be taken for the life of a murderer, it is supposed that for maims a pecuniary satisfaction was allowed. \n \n Personally we cannot seek revenge. However, God commands the civil government to execute murderers. \n \n Jesus did NOT make it clear the death penalty was wrong, he made it clear that personal revenge is wrong. \n \n \n THANK YOU EQUITY!!!!!!!\n \n don't be such a baby thistown! :D This is one of the hottest debates i'm a part of!",

   "you have to look at the origins of \"an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth\" it wasn't written by pharisees or the old hebrew government. it was written by the egyptian pharoah Hammurabi (it came from a list of laws called the Code of Hammurabi) somewhere between 3000 and 2000 bc. the hebrew people evidently learned this law while enslaved by the egyptians. the egyptians didn't believe in Elohim (a nickname for the hebrew god) and therefore that law was not a mandate from God to the hebrew people. it was an egyptian law that had existed for quite some time. i think it just carried over into hebrew society and became accepted.",

   "Here's the deal, I'll admit that the quote by Jesus does confuse me somewhat, but here's what I think, things did change, the compassion and mercy that are the New Testament are few and far between in the old. Laws of the Old Testament were changed and broken upon Jesus's birth and even more importantly his death. \n \n I checked with my Old Testament Lit teacher this morning about the adulterous woman and whether it was a Pharisee law or Roman and here is what I was told (I think he's pretty reliable, Phd, 31 years as a priest, 16 as a professor at 2 colleges): the Law was originally completely Jewish but was instituted into Roman law due to the fact that Pharisees were an integral part of of Roman government. Part of the law stipulated that Pharisees could carry out the punishment (Jesus executed outside of the law by the mob). So therefore yes, Jesus was going against the law, the institution, the government, whatever you say that capitol punishment is justified for.\n \n Now for your \"life for an eye, limb for a tooth thing\" where you state that the punishment should coincide with the crime. Read the Old Testament, for pete's sake I just quoted one, death to anyone who strikes his neighbor. So literally it was death for a tooth, and not due to the Pharisee's manipulation of the law, but due to the fact that the followed it explicitly. Matthew Henry has clearly neglected to read much of the Old Testament, or perhaps he, like most others neglects to address the verses that don't quite fit into his argument. \n \n I also have a problem with the fact that we as individuals, ae not to seek revenge, but a group of individuals (which is all that a government is) can. Personal life is not a small facet of life, it is life, and just because you are in a group rather than by yourself does not transform you into anything more than a collection of individuals, we simply attach a word to it which he have come to interpret as a seperate entity completely set aside from the human race. And as I just said Jesus was addressing the institution, the government.\n \n So I admitted that I didn't quite know how to interpret Jesus quote on the Old Law, so now you admit that you don't quite understand it either, that you do (not viciously or even always purposefully) use Old Testament passages as the foundation of your argument and then ignore the rest because it somewhat hinders your case. You admit that from the mouth of Jesus we find a man who is, aside from 1 controversial verse which doesn't mention the death penalty, we find overwhelming evidence in numerous cases that he was very much against the death penalty. That's all I need. \n \n Consider your argument, you have Old Testament verses as the core, which are usually immediately followed with directions on how to sell your daughter into slavery or how a woman must wash herself directly after her menstrual cycle to remain holy (apparently women who died in their period went to Sheol (the Hebrews of that time didn't believe in a hell, they believed in a purgatory type state which was neither good nor bad, just an absence of God), or that anyone who strikes someone, or blasphemes, or touches the curtain in the temple should be put to death. Your friend Henry doesn't believe that that this would constitute \"a life for an eye'? You said Jesus was addressing our \"personal lives\" (whatever that is) when he condemned the mob with the adulterous woman, I disproved that. I think that the evidence like it has from the beginning has pointed toward what any objective person, free from feeling of hatred and vengeance (modern day \"justice\"), anyone who believes in the soul changing hand of God and his intense love for the person that we're about to kill and send to hell would see that.",

   "Calligirl, I don't even want to waste my time explaining most of this to you but here goes...\n \n (All the quotes are yours, and I've tried to keep them in the order you stated them.)\n \n Ok, good start, I'm proud that you know that to cut off the penis is to castrate. And you made it sound like you were making some profound point, \"I'm sorry, but that's not what my version said\". Here's a hint, they said the exact same thing in different words, their called different versions of the Bible. And yes castration was usually on purpose, by cutting, but no one was ever castrated by crushing on purpose. Therefore if a man got in a fight, took a swift one to the fellas and they were crushed, he could not enter into the assembly of God. What does this have to do with the death penalty? You have obviously missed the entire point of the post (THIS is why I am repetitive people). You're quoting the Old Testament as \"proof\" for your argument. But your picking and choosing, you can't say that one Old Testament Law should be in effect today and then ignore the rest...so therefore...you following...unless you believe that we can't allow men with crushed testicles into church you can't run around using the \"eye for an eye\" or any of the other old laws. Onward.\n \n \"Different version here too. \"No one born of a forbidden marriage nor any of his descendants may enter the assembly of the LORD , even down to the tenth generation.\" Forbidden: not permitted or allowed\"\n \n Calli, sweetheart they say the EXACT same thing in different words. What's your point here? That forbidden means not allowed? Illigetimate is not permitted or allowed. Please stop wasting our time.\n \n \"Amazing how you simply took out the parts of the verse that didn't support your arguement.\"\n \n You see those little dots in between what I said???? That means there is something there. I don't like to type page after page. And how they hurt my argument I don't see. If you have a lazy, immoral son, stone him, that's what it says. Unless you believe that a parent has the right to stone their child because he's lazy and has premarital sex then you can't use Old Testament verse as an argument.\n \n \"Read to the very end of the verse. \"If you are not pleased with her, let her go wherever she wishes. You must not sell her or treat her as a slave, since you have dishonored her.\" \n \n Ok I read it...should I feel better. Basically it says that if, even though she is pretty, she isn't good in bed or doesn't cook very well, send her back home without charge. Unless you believe that the American troops in Iraq should be able under GOd's law to take a wife back home as basically a slave then you cannot use Old Testament verse as an argument.\n \n \"Read the entire verse and don't edit out parts of it.\"When you march up to attack a city, make its people an offer of peace. If they accept and open their gates, all the people in it shall be subject to forced labor and shall work for you. If they refuse to make peace and they engage you in battle, lay siege to that city.\" Hmmmm...death or slavery. Wow, that's a hard choice.\"\n \n Um, ok, once again it says the exact same thing, EXACT. And what relevance \"Hmmmm....death or slavery. That's a hard choice.\" has is completely beyond me. Unless you believe that if Iraq surrendered today that we, under the law of God, have a right to enslave their entire population then you cannot use old test. verse as an argument.\n \n \"Just another example of using a verse meant for personal use and applying it to wars. Sorry, just doesn't work that way.\"\n \n WHAT????? So you believe that if Iraq doesn't surrender we should kill every single male in the country and take their wives and children as slaves?!?!?!? Because guess what, if you don't believe that then you can't use Old Testament verse as argument.\n \n \"A slave was a piece of property taken after a war. Slavery back then was completely different then it is now.\"\n \n You're right about the first part (which only further proves my point), and you're horribly WRONG about the second. #1 there is no slavery today, #2 it was what slavery has always been, a person forced to work, through brutality and manipulation, without pay against their will. And I'm willing to go out on a limb and say that you have absolutely nothing to back up your statement that slavery \"wasn't the same back then\".\n \n \"She has done a disgraceful thing in Israel by being promiscuous while still in her father's house.\" Promiscuous:not restricted to one sexual partner (Kinda like a prostitute.)\"\n \n Ok, your point being....says the same thing as my version in more words...you should be picking up on that by now. And unless you believe that anyone who has engaged in premarital sex should be stoned in front of their father then you cannot use Old Testament verse in your argument.\n \n \"Yeah, it's called \"adultery\". Consequences are there to deter people from doing wrong.\"\n \n ....I'm aware it's adultery, but you don't believe that we should put all adulterers to death do you??? We are all adulterers (anyone who has looked upon a woman in lust has committed adultery with her in his heart). And yes Calli look it up, and it's kind of tricky at first, the actual words are different...but whoa!! they mean the same thing!!! I know it's scary at first.\n \n It was bad up to here, but your last quote to falling really scared me Calli\n \n \"The laws are still applicable, we just don't use them.\"\n \n Ooooooh. So the laws are still applicable...they can still be applied to eveyday use huh? I'm sure (I really hope) that you don't mean that. But the only way that you can use old testament verse in your argument is if you believe that each and every law on this page should be a law of the United States of America. That's the bottom line Calli, not that my version of the Bible says \"penis cut off\" and yours says castrated. If you haven't gotten what I'm getting at by now you never will.",

   "Here you go thistown: \n \n \n Deuteronomy 23:1 Mutilation was common among the heathen. This was to prevent Israelites from 1) accepting a pagan into the congregation, or 2) to do that to their own children. What is referred to here is NOT an accident. \n Deuteronomy 23:2 This was to provide a strong incentive for the children of Israel to \"live chastely.\"\n Deuteronomy 21:18 What's wrong with this one? \"Rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft.\" This is a last resort. There has to be a long train of rebellious action on the part of the son before it comes to this. And then you have to convince the judge of that. Not much chance for abuse here.\n Deuteronomy 21:10 This is a limit... meaning you cannot \"use\" a woman among the captives unless you marry her. (Remember, this is in refrence to the annihilation of the Canaanites. All males will be dead by this time.) \n Deuteronomy 20:11 This is mercy! Otherwise, they are going to be killed! Being a tributary is much to be preferred over death. \n Next verse: Presumably, you are marching on them for a pretty darn good reason. Loving your enemies doesn't apply. Civil government is incapable of emotion. Individuals aren't. \n Exodus 20:21 If the slave who had been beaten by his master died under his hand, the master was punished with death; But if he survived the beating a day or two the master was not punished, because it might be presumed that the man died through some other cause. All penal laws should be construed as favourably as possible to the accused. He was not a murderer in the eyes of the civil government, but he'll still have to answer to God. \n Deuteronomy 20:22 and 22:20. I fail to see your objection. Obviously, fornication is a grave sin in God's eyes, and he wishes to tell it to us in the strongest possible terms. \n \n NOW for the ones I asked for... :D\n \n Exodus 21:7 Remember, \"slavery\" under the law lasted for at the most 7 years... this is more of an apprenticeship, if you will. This was only permitted when the father was absolutely out of any capital whatsoever, moveable or immoveable. Not that I would do it.\n \n Numbers 35 I'm sorry, I read all of Numbers 35, and was unable to find anything to do with \"striking someone and receiving the death penalty.\" If you would, I'd like the verse too. Thx. \n \n First of all, I don't attend any established church. However, I would be willing to exercise a little church discipline in the area you mentioned, if it came up. The current civil government doesn't to execute rebellious children, and since they are the ones who must do it, it is no business of mine. I do not execute them... the state would. \n \n When I say I believe the whole Bible, I am not making noise. I know what I'm saying and I'm serious. \n \n I'm sorry you discredit Matthew Henry. Unfortunately, other commentaries I read also concur with his opinion. I do not know how that this makes him a \"purposefully and maliciously blind-to-what-he-doesn't-want-to-see\" person. There was no reason for that remark. Can you offer a better suggestion? Other commentaries concur that this is a rule for judges, that was both an admonishment to be just and to limit the punishment. I suppose this makes them all \"purposefully and maliciously blind-to-what-he-doesn't-want-to-see\" kinda people. \n \n Falling, at least thistown admits he doesn't understand it all! :D \n \n Calli, what this has to do with the death penalty is that these guys are trying to show me how \"ridiculous\" the Old Testament Laws are.

These are the people you WANT in the church.\n \n Anyway I guess I'll treat this like I did Calli's (I grow weary of this).\n \n \"Deuteronomy 23:2 This was to provide a strong incentive for the children of Israel to \"live chastely.\"\"\n \n Yes I suppose that death by stoning would be a pretty good incentive. but no one in their right mind would impose a law like this, no Christian at least.\n \n \"Deuteronomy 21:18 What's wrong with this one? \"Rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft.\" This is a last resort. There has to be a long train of rebellious action on the part of the son before it comes to this. And then you have to convince the judge of that. Not much chance for abuse here.\"\n \n Umm...I missed something, I read 3 different translations and none mention witchcraft. They mention laziness and drunkenness, but nothing of sorcery. \n \n \"Deuteronomy 20:11 This is mercy! Otherwise, they are going to be killed! Being a tributary is much to be preferred over death.\"\n \n This is not mercy...when someone surrenders you do not take them as your slave, take their women and children into bondage. Any nation present day who enslaved an entire culture in this manner would be seen on the same level as the Nazis. And I love how you use \"tributary\" instead of slave, makes it sound much more....\"merciful\".\n \n \"Exodus 20:21 If the slave who had been beaten by his master died under his hand, the master was punished with death; But if he survived the beating a day or two the master was not punished, because it might be presumed that the man died through some other cause. All penal laws should be construed as favourably as possible to the accused. He was not a murderer in the eyes of the civil government, but he'll still have to answer to God.\"\n \n Pretty much just gave up on this one huh? Yes they will have to answer to God, but remember these were laws given to the governing body by God so....irrelevant.\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n You've obviously failed to see my purpose behind these posts, and I grow very tired of repeating myself (I think you know what I am saying but choose not to answer).\n \n These were laws given to the governing bodies by God, exactly like the laws that you state in your argument against capitol punishment. You obviously (I hope) don't believe that some of these should become United States laws, but you believe that the one that you agree with should be. I am simply pointing out that your are selectively manipulating that which is \"the solemn and eternal word of God\" and the rest is...well you haven't addressed the rest yet, you've only avoided the issue by stating that I said \"cut off penis\" instead of circumcision and stating what the laws were designed to discourage.\n \n So here is my question, and for everyone's sake it's not a hard question, it's just a scary one to you. Why should the death penalty law from God carry over and the stone your child for being a fat, lazy drunk not? Why should the death penalty carry over and the death to all adulterers, or the law that the US must take all of any country we invade into slavery, or the no former pagans in the church laws, not apply? We can't have one without the other, in fact we can't have one without all of them. These laws come in a package, if you claim that they are the Laws of God (which I agree they are) and that Jesus's life and death didn't change them (which I think it did) then you have to believe that each and every one of them should be instated in the US law. Is that not perfectly clear? You can't call for the death penalty under God and ignore the rest.\n \n And Patriot, you're stooping. Stop trying to demonize me into some Old Testament hating pagan just because you've run out of things to say. It doesn't make you look better, I promise. You know full well that I don't believe that the Old Testament laws are \"ridiculous\", you would like to believe that I did, because then you could simply dismiss my arguments. But I believe in the laws of the Old Testament, I believe they were from God. But I believe that a man named Jesus took them all and made them into two, \"Love the Lord with all your heart\", \"And love your neighbor as yourself.\" I think that he is the reason that we don't stone our children anymore, or eliminate or enslave (if they're lucky) entire cultures and civilizations, or still believe in taking the life of a man as property (for 7 years or whatever, it is against his will and it is without pay=slavery). These are not the laws of Jesus Christ, they are not a part of the new covenant...but you obviously believe that one of them is a part, unfortunately my friend you can't just take one. If it applies they all do. Simple as that.\n \n If either of you don't realize what I'm saying I give up, it's doesn't get any more black and white. If either of you have anything intelligent to say I say let's continue, but I'm sick of repeating the same thing over and over while you two nitpick over the tiny and utterly irrelevant facets in order to draw attention away from the question.",

   "The Law of Moses in the Old Testament required the death penalty for certain sins such as adultery. How did Jesus handle this?\n \n \"The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a certain woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group and said to Jesus, 'Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?'....When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, 'If anyone of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.' \" \n (St John 8:3-7)\n \n The purpose of the Law of Moses was to prepare people for Christ. Now that Christ has come we are no longer bound by the Law of Moses.\n \"So the law was put in charge to lead us to Christ that we might be justified by faith. Now that faith has come, we are no longer under the supervision of the law.\" (Galations 3:24-25)\n \n I don't think the Bible justifies the death penalty.",

   "I think we should establish a basic premise or two here, to clarify the whole issue.\n \n 1. One's view of the validity of the Bible as the inspired, infallible Word of God will dictate their view on the applicablity of the laws. Do you, or do you not believe that (a.) the Bible is inspired by God, and that (b.) the Bible is absolutely infallible from end to end of both the Old and New Testaments? \n \n If your answer to either of the above questions is \"No\", then you will never understand or agree with the positions of anyone who answers \"Yes\". If your answer to both the questions is \"Yes\", then it follows that \n \n 2. You must believe that God said nothing without reason, that all Scripture is truth, and that, till heaven and earth pass, the entire law is either applicable to us today, or has been fulfilled (Matt. 5:17-18). \n \n If you agree with both the above premises, then we're on the same page and can debate intelligently. (And I don't mean \"nitpick over the tiny and utterly irrelevant facets\", either, Thistown :).) I don't believe in picking and choosing acceptable doctrines from the Bible, and so must believe that there is a reasonable explanation for any confusion. \n \n There are two types of law in the Old Testament, civil and ceremonial. Civil law dealt with, naturally, the civil government of the Israelites, and ceremonial law with the religious affairs of the nation. As has been elsewhere pointed out, Israel was a theocracy, with God as their sole head and leader. The entire law is an illustration of his perfect justice. Civil law was designed to empower earthly judges to exercise judgment on wrongdoers. Ceremonial law was designed to regulate the system of priests, Levites, sacrifices and offerings that centered around the Tabernacle (and later the Temple) and was God's prescribed means of gaining his favor before Christ's sacrificial death. It did also prescribe punishments for religious sins, not connected with the civil government. Every aspect of this sacred system was a type of some greater and more perfect thing which was to come. I won't cite examples now, for space' sake. I can, but if you've come this far, you probably understand. The pivotal point here is: The reason ceremonial law no longer applies to us today is that it was fulfilled by Christ. This fulfillment, symbolized by the rending in two of the veil of the Temple after Christ died, was once and for all. \n Civil law, on the other hand, cannot have been finally fulfilled by anyone at any time. It must therefore, according to Christ, have not yet passed away. \n Most of the verses you have cited, Thistown, are ceremonial law. Anything related to uncleaness, admission into the house of the Lord, and all other religious sins classify as ceremonial, applicable only to Old Testament Jews (and New Testament Jews up until Christ's death) and fulfilled by Christ's shedding of blood. \n A few of your other verses dealt with the treatment of the enemies of Israel. You must apply all relevant Scriptures if you wish to come to a proper understanding. Exodus 23:20-33 and Numbers 33:50-56 and just two places where the Lord's plans concerning the Israelites and their enemies are made clearer. We need not debate why this was God's plan, or whether it does or does not seem right to us, but I hope we can agree that, as these passages are clearly not meant to apply to us today, so other verses dealing specifically with the enemies of Israel have already been fulfilled in history. \n Another portion of the verses you brought out are civil and do apply to us today. Yes, I will say that I believe laws punishing deliberate immoral acts are perfectly just and right. You must, of course, apply the whole code, which requires witnesses and abundant proof. The simple reason that Matthew 5:28 is not relevant to this discussion is because the law, rightfully, makes no provision for unprovable, unwitnessable mental sins. \n As far the controversial incident in John 8:1-11, I will merely voice the questions that immediately come to my mind:\n As the incarnate Son of God, Christ was the only person who ever had or ever will have the power to forgive sins; who are we to question his use of that power?\n Where in the passage does it once even faintly indicate that Jesus did not believe the execution of the woman to be perfectly just and right? \n \n I hope I have addressed all the issues that have been raised here, but even if I haven't, I believe this differentiation between types of law to be the key to interpreting the entire Mosaic law. \n \n Thus, for certain sins the death penalty is fully Biblically justified.",

   "what you have said about Jesus Christ is one of the most sacreligious suggestions i have heard. you are suggesting that Jesus would have approved of the EXECUTION of the adultress? i cant believe a christian could possibly say that. i really cant. you might want to think twice before you suggest such a thing again. Jesus Christ was merciful and loving. the pharisees wanted to execute this woman, but Christ accepted her. are you suggesting Christ was wrong for not wanting to murder this woman?\n \n i dont think equity, patriot, and calli know what adultery is. according to Christ, a person commits adultery when he/she looks lustfully at someone. therefore, we are all guilty of this. so should we all be executed?\n \n i agree with thistown, these pro-deathers have run out of arguments and have abandoned all intelligence.",
