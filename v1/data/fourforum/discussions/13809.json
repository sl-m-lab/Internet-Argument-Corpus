   "The Massachusetts Democratic Party mailed a package that announced: \"1,736 Women Were Raped In Massachusetts in 2008; Scott Brown Wants Hospitals To Turn Them All Away.\" A TV commercial by Coakley flashed the words, \"Deny rape victims care,\" with a voiceover that announces, \"Brown even favors letting hospitals deny emergency contraception to rape victims.\"\n \n Team Coakley wanted the state's voters to think of Brown not as pro-life, but as an anti-abortion radical, a man so extreme that he had no compassion for female victims of a violent sexual crime. Brown's actual record was nothing like that. It was like turning Clark Kent into Jack the Ripper. \n \n ...\n \n Martha Coakley also demonstrated the secular liberal's intense desire to crush religious liberty in a radio interview on the same subject. When host Ken Pittman suggested there's still religious freedom in emergency rooms, Coakley said Catholics should avoid work in the field of health care: \"You can have religious freedom, but you probably shouldn't work in the emergency room.\" \n \n Doesn't that sound like the pro-abortion movement's version of \"Irish Need Not Apply?\"\n \n ...\n \n Reporters barely noticed that Obama slammed Republican Scott Brown in his Sunday appearance for Coakley, joking repeatedly about the GM truck Brown has driven around the state. He joked that Brown parked his truck on Wall Street, and \"I'd think long and hard about getting in that truck with Martha's opponent. It might not take you where you want to go,\" said the man trying to bring the country together. \n \n In a race for the \"Ted Kennedy seat,\" Obama may want to avoid perilous-driving jokes. But the media was there for their usual routine: to sanitize his partisanship. \n CNSNews.com - The Meanness of Martha Coakley\n \n Yes simone Scott Brown is way above the left on the moral high ground. Not only that but he won. This in spite of Patrick Kennedy being either back on the pills or stupid with \"Marcia, Marcia, Marcia.\"emoticon_xhoho",

It worked in WWII not because we spent a ton but because we blew everyone else to pieces and we restricted buying for 5 years. Of course there would be a demand after that. What Keynesians do is assume it can therefore apply to every situation and we have found that this is far from the truth. Cash for Clunkers failed, this stimulus failed, and every spending program thought to increase the economy has failed. What's the response? \"We didn't do enough\".
