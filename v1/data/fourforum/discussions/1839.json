Regardless of the higher plane theory, there are significantly different methods to getting there. The christian religion is the only one that claims you do not get there by anything you merit.

Much of the confusion is because these 3 follow the same 'family tree,' if you will. They do believe in one god, and they believe they all worship the same one (though many of them won't admit it or just don't know it). Where the differences come in is where they believe different historical figures (namely Jesus and Muhammad) fit into their religions. There are further two eastern religions which are absolutely and entirely different from both the western religions and each other: Hinduism and Buddhism.\n \n The comment that Buddhists just disagree on what God is like is ludicrous. Buddhism does not teach that there is a god. It is the only one of the 5 major religions which is not theistic; it is not about worship, or servitude to a deity, or anything like that. Before anyone comes along and says something like \"but they think Buddha was a god!\" let me just say that they don't. He is seen as a very wise man who became enlightened and tried to teach what he had realized. They don't think Buddha created the universe.\n \n The problem with this is that the prevalent Judaic-Christian powers in this country (and most of the western world) spend all of their time telling you 'the truth,' and nothing about other religions. I'd bet that if more people had any idea what Buddhism was like, alot of Christians, Jews, and Muslims would convert to it.\n \n Try this. Go to about.com. It's a great website. Go under the religion section, pull up in one window the page about Buddhism, and in one page pull up a more popular religion, I tried Mormonism. Compare the two. You'd be surprised, if you looked at it with an open mind (I don't follow any religion, so I kinda am open-minded in this regard), to find that the Mormon religion is far more superstitious, far more dangerous and scary, and it has a definate fantasy fell to it.
