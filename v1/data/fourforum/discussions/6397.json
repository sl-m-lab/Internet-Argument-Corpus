If they are from another country which would mean that the constitution would need to be changed, mark (if you know it) what country they are from or put a * by their name.

Even though Bush screwed around, he still had a record of that. I personally don't think that military record should really matter. Some of America's greatest war generals got elected president and were not that good at being president. Main point: I was just poking fun at the Vietnam deal that arose last year.",
