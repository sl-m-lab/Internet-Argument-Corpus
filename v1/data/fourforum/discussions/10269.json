   "I have read the link. Unfortunately, it is another case of wanting to see evidence where there is none.\n \n -witnesses:\n \nUndoubtedly the major impetus for the reassessment of the appearance tradition was the demonstration by Joachim Jeremias that in 1 Corinthians 15: 3-5 Paul is quoting an old Christian formula which he received and in turn passed on to his converts According to Galatians 1:18 \n\n Even the text itself points out that Paul is quoting an old Christian formula i.e. tradition. It only means that people have been telling the same thing to each other soon after Jesus' death. It has no bearing on the source of the formula. Take any contemporary urban legend, and you will see how people can quickly accept an idea as true without ever seeing any evidence.\n \n -historical sources:\n \nAccording to Professor Sherwin-White, the sources for Roman history are usually biased and removed at least one or two generations or even centuries from the events they record. Yet, he says, historians reconstruct with confidence what really happened. He chastises NT critics for not realizing what invaluable sources they have in the gospels.\n\n Exactly. However, we reconstruct the history by carefully evaluating these sources, comparing them to one another and in this process decide which sources are credible. We don't just take them at face value. If the source claims \"Caesar pontem fecit\", we certainly interpret it as \"Gaius Iulius Caesar in his capacity as army leader ordered that a bridge be built\" not as \"Gaius Iulius Caesar grabbed a saw and a mellet and built a bridge\". Similarly, we take \"Gallia est divisa in partes tres...\" but then compare it to archaeological data to see how accurate the claim is. And if a legendary king claims to have defeated the legendary bog beast of Deepbog, we look at any evidence (like fangs imbedded in the necklace he was buried with), or in the absence of any, seek a rational explanation. In the case of one Jesus Christ who is alleged to have risen from the dead, we look for any evidence of his actually having risen, and in case none are found, look for alternative explanations.\n \n -empty grave: Not clear on this subject here, must be some long going debate on the subject I'm not aware of. Insofar as I know, the church has ever claimed the grave was empty after Jesus left it.\n \n -the rapid rise of the Christian church\n \nthe birth and rapid rise of the Christian Church. . . remain an unsolved enigma for any historian who refuses to take seriously the only explanation offered by the church itself.\n\n First, I'm sure theories exist which would explain the rapid rise of the new religion. Second, even if no explanation has been found yet, this does not automatically mean that a mystical explanation is the only one possible.\n \n -the offered explanations\n Here the author takes three possible explanations of the events and sets them up as strawmen to take them down easily.\n \n a) Disciple intervention (stealing the corpse and lieing about it). All the author offers as contrary is \"Say it ain't so, Joe!\". Of course, this only works on the assumption that the disciples would never do such things. Take a look at all the medieval reliquaries and you'll see why this is not necessarily true. Also, this author starts with idea of malice. However, non-malicious explanations are also available (if a few disciples move the body to a more secure location to prevent desecration or to hide it from the authorities, they must by the nature of things do this secretly -now how does this look to the rest of the disciples)\n \n b) Jesus never dies. Yet again the author starts with the stated history and never considers possible other explanations, but that does not mean that they do not exist. One I can think of: Jesus almost dies on the cross, is buried while comatose, regains consciousness for even a few seconds, disciples rejoice and quickly move him to a different location to prevent further governmental prosecutin - result: empty grave and living Jesus.\n \n c) Hallucinations. The Author firmly rejects the very idea as the hallucinations match up too well. This however ignoresthe fact that Jesus' death and resurrection were long predicted. The disciples were already ingrained with the idea that their spiritual leader would die and be resurrected. From then on, it's all just a matter of psychology.\n \n \n \n This is a standard case of a strawman setup: the author presents the arguments contrary to his position in a \"weak\" manner and then proceeds to destroy them - easily done if you know how you've set them up in the first place.",

I admit I skimmed a bit towards the end, but it seemed to draw all its conclusions from one source: the Bible. Fine for a religious discussion, not so good if you're trying to do real scholarship. The Bible is certainly an interesting historical document, and using its contents to discuss the goings on of the time and place in question is fully justified. But it's an unreliable source. Things were written down years and years after the fact, and then who knows how many copies of copies of those original documents were made before they were compiled into a Bible? To claim that any conclusion reached solely through the consideration of just this one source is, as the author puts it, \"virtually indisputable\" is to demonstrate a poor grasp of how real historical scholarship works. What we're seeing here is faith applied to history. The author hopes the resurection is real, he needs it to be real, so any data that supports the historicality of the resurection is taken at face value, rather than exposed to the intellectual scrutiny that real historical scholarship calls for.",

Not much different.\n\n \n If you like the Santa Clause dig you \"intellectuals\" will really love the astromically improbable concept of abiogenesis. \n \n On science's attempts to explain / justify abiogenesis:\n \n \"There isn't any doubt that science, for the moment at least, is at a dead end. The optimism of the 1950's is gone. The mood at the 1999 international conference on origin of life was described as grim - full of frustration, pessimism, and desperation. Nobody pretends that any alternative provides a reasonable path of how life went unguided from simple chemicals to proteins to basic life forms. \"\n \n Quote by Walter L. Bradley, Ph.d., who received his B.S. in Engineering Science and his Ph.D. in Materials Science from the University of Texas in Austin. He taught as an Assistant and Associate Professor of Metallurgical Engineering at the Colorado School of Mines before assuming a position as Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Texas A&M University (TAMU) in 1976. Dr. Bradley, also served as Head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Texas A&M University and as Director of the Polymer Technology Center at TAMU. He currently serves as Distinguished Professor of Engineering at Baylor University. http://www.leaderu.com/offices/bradley/docs/designed.html\n \n Klaus Dose, the biochemist who's considered one of the foremost experts in this area, summed up the situation pretty well\":\n \n \"More than thirty years of experimentation on the origin of life in the fields of chemical and molecular evolution have led to a better perception of the immensity of the problem of the origin of life on earth rather than to its solution. At present all discussions on principle theories and experiments in the field have either ended in stalemate or in a confession of ignorance.\"\n \n Fred Hoyle was one of Britain's best-known mathematicians and astronomers in the last half of the 20th century. He spent decades searching for answers to questions of the origins of life and the origin and age of the universe. In his 1981 book Evolution from Space (co-authored with Chandra Wickramasinghe), he calculated that the chance of obtaining the required set of enzymes for even the simplest living cell was one in 1040,000 (one followed by 40,000 zeroes). Since the number of atoms in the known universe is infinitesimally tiny by comparison (1080), even a whole universe full of primordial soup wouldn't have a chance. \n \n http://www.answersingenesis.org/tj/v15/i3/hoyle.asp\n \n Dr. George Wald, a Nobel Prize-winning laureate from Harvard University, had this to say concerning spontaneous generation: \"One has only to contemplate the magnitude of this task to concede that the spontaneous generation of a living organism is impossible. Yet here we are - as a result, I believe, of spontaneous generation.\" \n \n That kind of a statement surely demonstrates a much greater faith than a religious creationist can possibly muster. Dr. Wald categorically states that it could not possibly have happened - yet he believes it did. A Christian who professes to so great a faith would be labeled as naive and gullible. What a difference a cloak of higher education makes to those who are so easily impressed! \n \n Oh ye of GREAT FAITH, Samiinh, for blindly believing in abiogenesis!!",

Good link that proves Jesus resurected and is God and our Saviour.\n\n \n Well, I see claims that there is evidence.. funny thing.. all the 'evidence' refered to is claims in the bible.. and therefore very circular evidence.\n \n The bible is true because it says so in the bible.\n \n Harry Potter could fly on a broom stick, because it said so in not only \"harry potter and the sorcers stone', but in \"harry potter and the chamber of secrets'",

Will let her go cheap; let me know.\n\n \n _______________________________________________________________\n \n I read it too...... Actually, I do have a reason for existence..As do all living things... My reason, in particular, was to marry a wonderful woman, have five children and ten grand children.. AND to make a tiny contribution to help make the earth a better place than when I first arrived.\n The spark deal...

   "Well, I actually find the existence of a man named Jesus who by reforming Judaism started a new religion quite probable. I even find most of his message quite worth following.\n\n \n \n ____________________________________________________________\n \n I too feel that jc existed. But, the son of god.. No way. In my opinion, he was a very charismatic man who took a very close look at his religion and decided that he could affect changes for the better. So, at the age of thirty, he stated to preach. And, as with a charismatic leaders, he had a devoted following.\n A good example of this type of leader is Oral Roberts. In 1983 Roberts said Jesus had appeared to him in person and commissioned him to find a cure for cancer. Where is the cure??\n In 1987, during a fund raising drive, Roberts announced to a television audience that unless he raised $8 million by that March, God would \"call him home\" (a euphemism for death). I guess people believed him... He raised 9.1 million dollars! \n He stirred controversy, when as TIME carried in 1987, that he and his son, Richard Roberts as witness, claimed that he had seen his father raise a child from the dead.
