That our notions of gender equality are just superficial trappings of civilisation and not inherent rights as such?\n\n \n I think Maslow's description of a \"hierarchy of needs\", illustrates what I look at as \"natural state\".\n \n Self Actualization <--- final needs, best one can possibly be\n Self-Esteem <- self-worth, being good at something, etc.\n Love <-- not sex, includes friendship, and romantic love\n Safety <-- shelter, not at risk, mostly physiological risk\n Physiology <-- foundation, like sex, food, drink, air\n \n While I don't agree with this in it's entirety, or in the all applications, I think it's a fairly realistic way of looking at human nature, at any given level in the hierarchy.\n \n Think about this too:\n The greeks and romans had none of our modern technological wonders, yet they had quite a civilization, one on which most countries are now based. All fields of study and knowldge were most notably formalized by the greeks. Economics, biology, psychology, medicine, philosphy...these are fields of study these people built universities around (!). Their civilizations prospered not because of technology, per se, but because of their needs being met, which gave them liesure time, to ponder, and learn. All as a result of...of all things..politics (i.e. working together, community).\n \n Community, I would argue, is our natural state. Man, on the average, is a social creature, and left to our own devices, we group together, establish a community, and seek out our needs.\n \n Just my take of course, good question.\n \n -Mach",
