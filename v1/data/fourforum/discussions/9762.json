It gives the impression that the govt. isn't supporting contraceptive teaching too, and that's not the case. Schools are funded for all types of sex-education. Abstinence-only usually means that, alongside teaching about birth control, it is also taught that abstinence instead of having to rely on those other things is the better way. And it is a lie to say that abstinence is ineffective--by it's very nature it is the most effective form of birth-control and the only fool-proof way.",

Looking at stats in terms of numbers of abstinence-cases versus numbers of those who gave in isn't a very good way to look at it, because if even one person is successfully abstinent, it makes the focus worth it. You have to remember that kids are inundated with birth control messages these days--it's the rule nowadays and abstinence is the exception. Good grief, I went to high school over 20 years ago, and they taught about contraceptives even then. \n \n Another thing that bugs me about opponents of abstinence-focused ed. is that it is so based on the blanket philosophy that \"kids are going to do it anyway\". That's the predominant thing I hear. But in point of fact, no, some kids many NOT have sex until marriage. I didn't, and I know plenty that didn't. There's nothing wrong with teaching kids to wait until they are married to someone. It's a GOOD thing to do. Living a sexual lifestyle as a kid has ruined a lot of lives for many kids, and that's just the way it is. We need to get back to having some chutzpah with our teenagers in society and emphasizing to them some self-control. Believe it or not, self-control is a good thing.\n \n If opponents of this sort of education actually seemed to value abstinence rather than just sort of passively saying they \"aren't against it\" yet throwing full support and encouragement to contraceptive-teaching, it would make them seem less biased. I think a lot of these opponents put up this opposition to \"abstinence-only\" as a way to really deal with the fact they just really don't like the idea of abstinence period.

I rarely ever see opponents of abstinence-only come out and actually say that.\n \n \nIs it worth it if 10 other teens get pregnant because they were not taught safe sex?\n\n \n Answer me this. At your school, where it is rare, how many kids do you really think don't know about condoms and what they are for? Do you see my point? Focus and knowledge of contraceptive use is everywhere. It's the standard in our society now--this isn't the 1950s and the sexual revolution was about 40 years ago. You have little or nothing to worry about from the message of abstinence--even abstinence-only. It's by far the exception and not the rule. Heck, condom machines are commonplace, but when was the last time you saw a message in a restroom about waiting until marriage? \n \n I'm not saying contraceptive use shouldn't be taught. I believe very few people believe that. The real threat here isn't that contraceptives aren't taught in our society--they are, and students usually know about it even in the few schools that don't teach about it to some degree. The threat is that self-control/abstinence won't be taught. In today's sex-obsessed culture, it's focus is getting more and more rare.\n \n \nI know this is a pretty extreme analogy, but if you put a steak in front of a dog and the dog eats it, is it really the dog's fault? Teens have raging hormones, social pressure, and mixed messages coming from our culture.\n\n \n The idea that teens don't have it in them to exercise self-control is pretty demeaning to teens, IMO. Teens should be taught self-control, and yes, it is their fault when they don't exercise it. You just pointed out yourself social pressure and cultural mixed messages--I for one would like to see that countered some rather than merely accommodated. In our society we have standards that say kids aren't supposed to drive until a certain point. They aren't supposed to play with explosives. They aren't supposed to buy drugs and alcohol. There are reasons for these standards in society, and in all these cases we don't approach it by merely saying it's ok by advocating a \"safe\" form of it. Why do we approach sex so differently? I'm not saying we should have laws against it, but I am saying we should be focusing more on self-control and abstinence. I honestly believe that if the left would put even half as much emphasis on abstinence even alongside safe-sex as they do merely safe-sex, there wouldn't be nearly the problem there is in the first place.",

Because someone who is sexually active is far more likely to get an STD than someone who isn't. Of course they need to be taught safe-sex too.

We know this because they are being funded at MUCH higher levels. If not for Bush's initiatives, there would be NO abstinence-ed funding whatsoever (of any sort), and the govt. would ONLY be funding contraceptive-ed. It's only adding on to what is already there.

   "A new study authorized by US Congress has found that the federal abstinence education programs that encourage adolescents to abstain from having sex during their early years proved ineffective. \n The abstinence program did not persuade youth from having sex, nor change their other sexual behavior including condom use, according to the 164-paged study report released yesterday by Mathematica-Policy Research, Inc. The report will be reviewed by the United States Department of Health and Human Service Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation. \n The Abstinence Education Program receives $175 million from the federal government and funds also from states each year, according to the report. The program results from the enactment of Title V, Section 510 of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 which aims to promote sexual abstinence and health behavior in teenagers. \n \n Below are excerpts from the report and a definition of these programs.\n \n IMPACTS ON BEHAVIOR\n Findings indicate that youth in the program group were no more likely than control group youth to have abstained from sex and, among those who reported having had sex, they had similar numbers of sexual partners and had initiated sex at the same mean age. Contrary to concerns raised by some critics of the Title V, Section 510 abstinence funding, however, program group youth were no more likely to have engaged in unprotected sex than control group youth.\n \n IMPACTS ON KNOWLEDGE OF RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH TEEN SEX\n Overall, the programs improved identification of STDs but had no overall impact on knowledge of unprotected sex risks and the consequences of STDs. Both program and control group youth had a good understanding of the risks of pregnancy but a less clear understanding of STDs and their health consequences.\n \n \n \n Definition of Abstinence Education for Title V, Section 510 Programs\n \n A Have as its exclusive purpose teaching the social, psychological, and health gains to be realized by abstaining from sexual activity\n B Teach abstinence from sexual activity outside marriage as the expected standard for all school-age children\n C Teach that abstinence from sexual activity is the only certain way to avoid out-of-wedlock pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and other associated health problems\n D Teach that a mutually faithful, monogamous relationship in the context of marriage is the expected standard of sexual activity\n E Teach that sexual activity outside the context of marriage is likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects\n F Teach that bearing children out of wedlock is likely to have harmful consequences for the child, the child's parents, and society\n G Teach young people how to reject sexual advances and how alcohol and drug use increases vulnerability to sexual advances\n H Teach the importance of attaining self-sufficiency before engaging in sexual activity\n \n \n Source: Title V, Section 510 (b)(2)(A-H) of the Social Security Act (P.L. 104-193).\n \n http://www.mathematica-mpr.com/publications/PDFs/impactabstinence.pdf",

This is a perfectly reasonable position to take, of course.\n \n I happen to disagree. I don't think that pre-marital sex is immoral. I don't think that sex per se has anything to do with morality. Morality is about harming people. If sex harms someone - like yourself or others emotionally or bringing an unwanted baby into the world or hurting or killing someone with a disease - that's immoral. Sex is sex, something different altogether. I also happen to think that waiting until marriage to have sex is a spectacularly terrible idea. I also think that people should not have sex until they are emotionally mature enough to deal with it. The emotional maturity of most US teenagers, in my opinion, is not great enough before they are 18 or so. Many exceptions, of course. My opinion, entirely. \n \n What have the two previous paragraphs got to do with sex education? NOT A FRIGGING THING!!! It is not the responsibility of the government to impart a moral sensibility on children concerning a topic that has such a spectrum of opinion from parents. The goal of sex education is to prevent unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. If teaching them to have sex with blow-up dolls was shown to be undeniably extremely effective in achieving these goals, I would be all for it. My point is that we have a crisis here. We need to try to learn what works to reduce harm and do it. If that means getting a few noses out of joint, I wish all parents and citizens would get their heads out of their asses and be willing to get their nose tweaked a bit for the good of their children. (What a bizarre mixed metaphor!) That's called loving your children. \n \n We don't know what the most effective education methods are. We do know that abstinence-only is a bad idea. It is a bad idea solely because it works no better than doing nothing. Some studies have shown it is worse. That is the only reason it is a bad idea - certainly not because it conflicts with one's perception of some liberal mentality. \n \n Teach your kids morals at home. That is the job for parents. If the schools can have a hand in imparting upstanding morality, that's fine as well. However, sex education is simply that. Education. It is training them not to get pregnant or infected. If teaching abstinence works for your kid, great. It does not work lots of other kids. Arming all kids with only one tool is simply foolish. And that is what we are spending a lot of money doing.",

Morality is about harming people.\n\n \n If you think about it, the view that it is good to wait until marriage to have sex is not that different from your view. I'd say that sex certainly IS harmful in cases where there is not enough emotional maturity for it. And, I believe psychology supports the concept of sexual addiction as well, which is not a good thing. A lot of the reason marriage is used in this issue is that, because it is (ideally) a life-commitment, it serves as a sort of point where emotional connection and maturity are there for the sexual relationship. 'Sex in the context of marriage' is really just another way to say 'sex with a commitment to someone.' This is a good thing, not a bad thing. Now of course, there are plenty of marriages that don't coincide with emotional maturity. But hopefully emotional maturity will result in the understanding that sex is a powerful thing, and that commitment to someone is best rather than promiscuity. I think a lot of people view the no-sex-before-marriage thing as just some fundamentalist dogma, but it's really just a way of saying 'no-sex-outside-of-commitment'. Because that's really what marriage is. A commitment to someone. A lot of non-religious people hold to the view that sex outside of a commitment to someone should be discouraged. That's really all the no-premarital-sex thing is, for many of us.\n \n \nI also happen to think that waiting until marriage to have sex is a spectacularly terrible idea. \n\n \n Wow, that is fascinating! I can't help but wonder why you think so. What on earth is so spectacularly bad about doing that??? As someone who waited, I can tell you that my marriage is just fine! There are also marriages of which couples are quite happy which cannot have sex at all, for whatever reason. Sex is not what a good marriage is about.\n \n \nWhat have the two previous paragraphs got to do with sex education? NOT A FRIGGING THING!!!

The goal of sex education is to prevent unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases.\n\n \n Again, abstinence and morality are not necessarily the same thing. Morality did not enter this discussion, that I am aware of, until you brought it up. I for one never said I was arguing for abstinence from merely a moral POV--IMO abstinence is very pragmatic.",

   " \n Wow, that is fascinating! I can't help but wonder why you think so. What on earth is so spectacularly bad about doing that??? As someone who waited, I can tell you that my marriage is just fine! There are also marriages of which couples are quite happy which cannot have sex at all, for whatever reason. Sex is not what a good marriage is about. \n\n \n Clearly we disagree with this.\n Although I think this is not exactly on topic, you wondered. \n A good marriage is \"not about\" sex, most certainly. But it certainly is an important aspect of a marriage. Not the only thing, not in the top 5, in my opinioin. It is one of many aspects of a good relationship. You can, of course, have a wonderful relationship without it. If you are going to be sexual, I just don't see the point of waiting until the marriage. I would hope that couples are compatible in many aspects of life, including sex. Would hate to find out until it's too late. Also, I just think that while the idea of having sex with only one person ever is possible, I just don't think it is .... well, normal, for lack of a better term. \n \n My idea of a nightmare is the wedding night. Two fumbling kids who have a really bad experience, setting the stage for a lifetime of bad sex. \n \n You may have done just fine. Bully for you. I just think that is a difficult feat. My opinion. You and I disagree. I don't want to argue this. You asked. \n \n \n \n \n \n Again, abstinence and morality are not necessarily the same thing. Morality did not enter this discussion, that I am aware of, until you brought it up. I for one never said I was arguing for abstinence from merely a moral POV--IMO abstinence is very pragmatic. \n\n \n As I said before, \n \nWhy would anyone even conceive of such an idea - teaching abstinence only- if not coming at the problem from an ideological bent? The whole basis of this approach is the implicit endorsement of a certain morality. It didn't come from the public health arena. It is a solely political idea . \n \n\n If you like, refute that opinion. \n This approach is coming at the problem from a pre-conceived perspective of the way things \"ought\" to be. If approaching it rationally, the idea of only teaching a single method of harm reduction seems idiotic to me. \n Over.",

   "\n I was a teen and I had a condom in my wallet. But unless the girl INSISTED BY CLOSING HER LEGS that I put it on, I never would have used one ever. That is the nature of boys. And it scares me to remember how many girls never made me put one on while in the throws of passion. It's an absolute miracle I only got one girl pregnant as a teen. \n \n\n \n \n Gaetano:\n Yet here we have another example of the reprobate ways and moral depravity of spiritually challenged heterosexuals. Children are meant to be born of love. Instead many of them are spawned from lust. Lust that is founded in opposite sex attraction.\n\n \n Actually, it seems to be an example of the reprobate ways and moral depravity of the religious right. \n \n I am an atheist, and I was VERY much more responsible than that.",
