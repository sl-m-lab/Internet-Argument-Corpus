   "It seems there are a few people here who view this forum as a place to blow off steam and live out their prejudices against religion. I logged on today and realised that there are a number of very incendiary thread titles here that would of course be considered unacceptable with many other areas of prejudice (such as black people, gays, Jews, etc,). Prejudice against religion really is the last socially acceptable form of bigotry. \n \n Here are some recent threads that have been started here:\n \n - Nothing fails like prayer\n - Christians, leave me alone and leave science alone\n - Roman Catholicism, slavery, African Americans\n - frightening/troubling religious statements/acts\n - Why I hate, hate, hate religion\n - The real cause of all grief (religion, of course)\n - Manifesto against theocratism\n \n And that doesn't even include the threads that are at least worded in a non-volatile way (such as \"Questions for Christians\" and \"On what day was Jesus Crucified; contradiction\"), but yet still reveal anti-religious (particularly anti-Christian) bias, when one goes deeper.\n \n Can you imagine the outcry it would produce if people posted things like \"Black people, leave me alone\" or \"why I hate, hate, hate homosexuality\"? If these titles and posts were written in an objective and un-incendiary way, I'd say they are honest attempts toward discussion. But titles like \"\"Nothing fails like prayer\" and \"Christians leave me alone\" are obviously written to get a rise out of people. Bigoted senstationalism, apparently. It seems Dametel and Simone are the two biggest bigots-in-question here given the titles and frequency of their posts about religion. I hope this will give a good chance for they and others like them to step back and realize the sort of message they're really getting across, and it ain't pretty. It's more on par with what the KKK would say about something than what a tolerant person would say.",

Religion and prayer are things that are very, very personal and dear to a lot of people.

Ultimately it all comes down to the fact that some here are hostile toward Christianity--it's a form of prejudice. And frankly, I can see no good rational reason to be spiteful and hostile over attempts to proselytize. It bothers me a lot more that there are some in society who are intolerant of hearing something they might not agree with to the point of being hostile in return. Personally, I think it's kind of fun to have a person of a given religion try to proselytize me. Like I said, it gives a good opportunity to dialog, even if the other person isn't really that interested in my POV.\n \n \nYou refer, as an instance, to the thread on the failure of prayer. Christians believe that prayers are answered. There are good grounds for doubting this article of faith and it is not 'prejudice' to draw attention to them.\n\n \n Doubting is fine, IMO. Posting that you doubt and giving the reasons is fine too, IMO. But there's no reason to use insulting titles when it's known that prayer and religion are very dear to people. And when one or two posters consistently post over and over such things against religion, it shows a pattern. If you went to a person's home and saw that they had an urn of a deceased loved one's ashes on the mantle, would you make intentionally disprespectful comments about it knowing it was something that was dear to them or consistently and over-and-over talk bad about their urn? Why is the reality that prayer and religion is dear to them any different? Understand that doesn't mean the urn can't be discussed or even evaluated. This isn't a question of \"if\" but rather \"how.\"\n \n Sometimes tone says a lot more than the post itself.",

As to the argument that we should not criticise what is dear to others' hearts, this is specious: the jihad may be dear to the hearts of suicide bombers, but I don't exempt them from criticism because of it.\n\n \n Well, let's be clear--that suicide bombing is harmful is quite a given--but the idea that religion itself is harmful, particularly prostlytizing, is NOT a given. I just don't see how hostility toward something like that is reasonable, particularly when you know that people can be religion and even prostlytize in a non-harmful way (and many do). To use harm as grounds for prejudice, harm needs to be quantifiably proven. Otherwise that prejudice is no different than people who claim black people are harmful and so have prejudice against them for it. So yes, I'd say hostility toward something is a form a prejudice, in and of itself. But prejudice isn't always a bad thing, such as in your example if Nazism (the usual worst-case fall-back example). Hostility, when there is no good quantifiable reason for it, IS a bad form of prejudice, IMO. And of course you could dig up examples from Christian history where Christians did acts of harm. The crusades, an event hundreds and hundreds of years ago in a much different time and culture came out of the Christian religion--but never mind the fact that most Christians certainly don't harm people. But one could also dig up examples of harm done by probably any individuals of any group (African-Americans, Jews, gays, caucasions, Irish Catholics and/or protestants, American southerners, American northerners, U.S. military servicepeople, etc, etc, etc.)--I don't think individual acts like that are good reason for bigotry and prejudice, and prejudice against religion is no exception.\n \n Also, you used the phrase \"hostility to an institution\" to defend your position. I'd say that saying things like \"Nothing Fails Like Prayer\" or \"Christians leave me alone\" don't address an institution at all; do you? These aren't statements against any religious institution--they are against prayer and Christian people (hence the plural form of Christian). I don't mean to split hairs here, but I think the distinction is important because I don't think these are statements against an institution at all, but rather individuals and things they hold dear and sacred.\n \n And again, we aren't talking about whether or not prayer or religion can be questioned or evaluated.

Only the cohen hagadol was allowed to pass through it into the Holy of Holies; and that he could do only once a year, on Yom-Kippur, to make an atonement sacrifice for his sins and for the sins of the Jewish people. When it was ripped in two from top to bottom it symbolized the fact that God was giving everyone access to the most holy place of all in heaven, as taught explicitly at MJ 9:3-9, 10:19-22 [that's \"Hebrews\" for us goyim,)].\n \n The Talmud bears an amazing witness to the work of Yeshua in altering the system of atonement.

In fact, my view that religion in general is a not a bad thing is based on weighing the evidence from both sides. To me, the positive effects on society outweighs the negative. But even if there were NO positive effects on society, unless harm can quantitatively be proven with religion (or a given religion), then we aren't going to ever get anywhere. There was a time in history that, for example, Christianity being lived out could quantitatively be proven as harmful. I don't think that's the case today, other than maybe some isolated incidents.

Why? Because you cannot possibly be personally aware of every piece of evidence for or against religion as a positive force, correct? Therefore your opinion that it is a force for good is - at best - a judgement call based on what you do know and the weight you have attached to that information.

That's the part that can't be left out of this. \n \n I do agree with John however, that prejudice and bigotry are not necessarily the same thing--there can be positive prejudice. However I don't think this is such a case. Again, if we take any form of bigotry against a minority, then there's a good chance it's bigotry. We wouldn't try to vilify gay people or african americans. (or if we did, it would be thought of as bigotry.)

It's one thing to try abolishing slavery where the evidence of harm and intrusion is very compelling. (even at the time. A whip and chain is a whip and chain no matter what time frame.) But it's something much different to try and abolish modern religion based on harm, because you can't really show enough evidence to do it. Even if you do show examples where religion harms people, defenders of religion can show examples where religion has definitely helped people.

Take religious 'good works' for example - of which a large list has already been copy-pasted. I'm reminded of an old gag: if you want to become rich you should go to the opera, because all you ever see there are rich people. Amongst other things, religions advertise themselves as clubs for people who want to be nice to others. Unsurprising, then, that many of them are full of nice people being good to others. Does religion create nice people, or does it just give them somewhere to hang out and organise?\n \n I've also had it pointed out to me that religion has helped people suffering from drug addiction - which on the face of it is great. On the other hand, my understanding is that addiction to one particular drug is a symptom of an addictive personality; the notion that religion is an effective substitute for chemical-based escape from reality is not, to me, a brilliant advertisement!\n \n I have to go now; work calls.

You guys are trying to say that \"prejudice\" and \"bigotry\" carry equal weight when they refer to something positive (my view that religion is beneficial). Your use of the term applying it to my position is like saying that someone is bigoted by saying that black people are positive for society, which of course is silly.\n \n \nAssuming that you are prepared to continue the discussion on an equal footing, I'd like to talk about this evidence for the beneficial nature of religion.

How much credit is religion actually due?\n\n \n To me this isn't about giving religion credit, but rather ensuring that it NOT be attacked and needlessly vilified. I'm defending religion here, not pushing it. I see a lot of threads here talking about religion in a bad light--almost always Christianity--at the expense of most any other issue.

Is the whole bundle needed - unpleasant side effects and all - to enjoy the benefits, or could something more palatable be synthesised?\n\n \n Agreed, and indeed there are sometimes bad examples of religion: the IRA, Muslim extremists, etc. But I would also add that one could argue these are more examples of extremism than religion causing the problem. Usually there are political causes at work in these bad situations. And yes, I'd say the whole bundle is needed to ensure religious freedom. We don't oppress all black people just because there are criminals out there with dark skin, even if one claimed to do crime for the cause of the black race. We, as a rational society, realize that these are cases where a criminal who was black did this, and it doesn't reflect on all black people. The same idea applies here with religion--we shouldn't throw the baby out with the bath water and assume all religion is bad just because of some bad examples.\n \n \nI've also had it pointed out to me that religion has helped people suffering from drug addiction - which on the face of it is great. On the other hand, my understanding is that addiction to one particular drug is a symptom of an addictive personality; the notion that religion is an effective substitute for chemical-based escape from reality is not, to me, a brilliant advertisement!\n\n \n The programs I've seen that religiously-based don't do that. They take an approach very much like any secular-based program, only adding that belief and trust in God does help. But they don't sacrifice the normal approaches to fighting drug addiction.",

If homosexuals were being arrested here, sent to prison or executed as happens in between 40 and 50 other countries today, then they would have a true civil rights cause. But homosexuals in America have every single human rights protection that straights enjoy. And even some which were written specifically for them such as hate crime legislation.\n \n But to infer that the larger community rejects redefining marriage for them as it does for many other unnatural lifestyles which it deems unacceptable is at all discriminatory, or based on bigotry, is a red herring in the least, and more accurately a subversive ploy to create false sympathy by making it a civil rights issue, which it isn't. In other words, gay marriage isn't being rejected in order to deny homosexuals anything. It is being rejected in order to protect marriage as it was originally defined. Just because homosexuals disagree with that definition, it doesn't mean it's an attempt to deny them anything at all. It just means that the larger community sees the slippery slope such a redefinition will have on marriage and doesn't want to open that can of worms.",
