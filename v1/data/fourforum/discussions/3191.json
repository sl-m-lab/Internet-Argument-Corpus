   "Due to US actions against virtually all Muslims, domestic and those outside US borders, I'd think that would be a natural progression. We (the US) currently employ what would be described as police state methodology to Muslims under the guise of national defense. Racial profiling, suspension of civil rights under the Patriot Act, totalitarian occupation of Iraq, support of Israel's expansionist policies, economic sanctions and threats directed to Iran, Syria and other nations governed in accordance to Islamic Law would, were I a Muslim, make me very paranoid. \n \n The US devotes in excess of 50% of its operating budget to military expenditures. We have a history from WW11 on of armed aggression, indirectly and on a direct intervention basis, of destabilizing S. American, Indochinese and ME nations, including invasion and occupation for purposes of establishing our political ideology and serving the requirements of special interests. We're now using our technology to electronically invade all countries suspected of affiliation with or support of Islamic extremists under the guise of tracking financial transactions relating to those extremists. While excepting the Sauds, who do finance most of those groups, and Pakistan, a haven for extremist groups, because we've labeled them as allys. \n \n I'd think that type of history and current activity would make any nation with a predominately Muslim population circle the wagons and move them to closer association with like nations.",
