   "Well, I hope the Politicos act quick 'cause folks here sure do need their help. Just ask any one of the million people in Kentucky and surrounding areas affected by the recent ice storm. We must act fast and cut emissions quick, so we could get back to the nice cold air we used to have, I mean, hot air, um, you know what I mean \n \n Like for instance, this piece of AP news I just received -\n \n Dozens of deaths have been reported and many people are pleading for a faster response to the power outages. About 536,000 homes and businesses across Kentucky were without power, down from more than 600,000 the largest outage in state history, surpassing the damage last year from the remnants of Hurricane Ike.\n \n Surpassing the damage of Hurricane Ike?!! O man. We gotta do something about this. When is Obama gonna jumpstart that carbon tax thing and put us right back on track? Any person with half a brain knows the economy sure needs it.",
