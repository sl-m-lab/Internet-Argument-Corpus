   "Time to pay the piper. There is no free lunch. I was reading about this in the WSJ today. The true rate of unemployment may be as high as 20% in Sweden.\n =========================\n \n Published: 22nd May 2005 23:31 CET\n LO \"suppressed unemployment report\"\n \n Sweden's trade union organisation, LO, has been accused of trying to suppress a report that claimed that the real number of unemployed people in Sweden could be much higher than the five percent shown in official figures.\n \n The report's author, Jan Edling, resigned from LO last week claiming that the organisation was trying to block his report, which he had spent five years writing. He accused LO's leadership of being motivated by a desire to protect the Social Democratic Party from embarrassment.\n \n Now both the content and the ensuing internal strife have been made public. The report was published by Timbro on its website.\n \n Five percent of Swedes of working age are currently classed as unemployed. A further three percent are occupied in state-organised job schemes. The controversy surrounding Edling's report centres on his interpretation of the 700,000 Swedes who are either on long-term sick leave or in early retirement. Edling asks how many of these people are in fact unemployed.\n \n Edling focuses on certain regions with high numbers of people on sick leave and in early retirement, and concludes that the real reason that people are not in work is that there are no jobs.\n \n \"The shortage of jobs is channeled partly into early retirement and sick leave,\" he told Dagens Nyheter.\n \n Edling criticises the government's current policies to tackle unemployment, and says that better business policies are needed to help areas with high jobless figures.\n \n LO's failure to publish the report has been slammed by Edling as politically motivated.\n \n \"They are worried that the fact that someone at LO is saying that early retirement is actually unemployment will play into the Moderates' hands,\" he told DN, but claimed that all he wanted was for the government to understand that a new policy was needed that \"creates growth in all regions.\"\n \n LO claims that it delayed publication of the report in order to complement it with suggestions for how the Swedish job market can be improved.\n \n \"The problem with the report is not the Jan Edling's analysis, it is the fact that the analysis dominates.\" Leif H\u00e5kansson, LO vice chairman told DN.\n \n In an attempt to address criticism, LO announced on Friday that it would hold a debate entitled \"How high is unemployment?\" at which Edling would participate.\n \n In a press release, the organisation said that the debate was being held to tackle suggestions that \"such a discussion is too sensitive and in some way was not accepted internally within LO\". The debate will take place on Wednesday at 'LO Towers', the organisation's Stockholm headquarters.\n \n Debating with Edling will be senior representatives from LO, the Social Insurance Office, and \"experts from government authorities and researchers.\"\n \n The feeling that LO will not brook dissent has been reinforced by the departure of LO ombudsman Olle Sahlstr\u00f6m. Aftonbladet reported that three years ago Sahlstr\u00f6m publically criticized LO. He spoke out that LO was a bit too close to the Social Democratic Party and that the union was becoming political.\n \n Sahlstr\u00f6m was called unloyal and found himself for two years without an assignment. Recent negotiations resulted in an early retirement deal.\n \n \"Those who don't hold the party line are damned\" Sahlstr\u00f6m said.\n \n Elizabeth Dacey-Fondelius/ James Savage\n \n http://www.thelocal.se/article.php?ID=1477&date=20050522",

   "Hmmm.. where to start.. I`ll start of by saying that the claim of 20% unemployment rate in Sweden is an outright lie. Now, that ought to get your attention. :p Please read on.\n \n I`ve read the report in question. It was an interesting read, but the figures presented where not very new or revolutionary in any way. I aslo followed the debacle around Jan Edlings resignation and how LO handled the media attention. There was nothing dramatic or really significant about the event. \n \n A few flaws with the article presented:\n \n The report was never surpressed. It was merely delayed for political purposes. There is nothing un-orthodox with this type of behaviour from a private institution with vested political interests. There where IMO three reasons this was even recognized by the media:\n 1) Jan Edling resigned over it, which is rather uncommon. But on the other hand, Mr Edling and the LO leadership reconciled very quickly. And according to Mr Edling, there is no bad blood between them. \n 2) A similiar event took place just a few weeks prior. But this time it was a governmental organisation that refused to back one of their own studies (regarding the importance of having qualified teachers). That time, it was more interesting because it was a public institution that is supposed to be politicly-neutral that revoked a study .\n 3) Just like in the US, Swedish media is liberal. Unlike the US, the Swedish liberal is considered right-winged. The event garnered very little attention in the actual news section, but where often cited in the oppinion pages.\n \n Jan Edling never claimed unemployment figures where 20%. It would be rather insane to classify all disabled, students and retired in the ages 24-65 as unemployed... It would also require that we would increase our official labour participation figures with about 10 percentage points (from around 74% to 84%, the equivalent figure in the states is probably a bit over 62%). From an international standpoint, that would also be dishonest since this is not how others measure unemployment or labour particpation rate and comparative studies with other OECD countries would be virtually impossible. But yes, the unemployment figures are higher than 5 percent. That is the figure for open unemployment. The figure for the total unemployment rate, that is; for those in unemployment and participating in unemployment programes (such as re-education, internship, subsidized employment etc) is around 8%. Yet again, these figures are hard to compare internationaly (due to standard OECD classifications) but are used daily in the domestic debate.\n \n The article presented here (as well as quite a few Swedish editorials I`ve read) seems to making the claim that the reason the study was politicly sensitive was due to the figures of long-term disability pay, early reirement, and higher education particpation. This is not really accurate though. These figures have been around for a long time (they are actually better now than just a few years ago without causing any debate or political controversy). The political sensitivity lies in the indirect accusation of the municipal governments in the northern parts of Sweden as well as the presented over-representation of long-term disability pay and early reirementin the same areas. These are traditional social-democratic bastions. Much political blood has been spilt over the discussion of northern sweden and how they leach of the rest. There is huge political ramifications for LO and the social democrats to give in to the critisism that northern sweden is generally a drain on the other parts of Sweden... It was the discrepancies (sp?) between regions in Sweden that where the focus of the report. This was also where the political issue where. Not the actual performance of the Swedish economy (that Jan Edeling actually was quite optimistic about)... \n \n Hope I could shed some light on the issue. If there is anything anyone would like to know about the report, just ask me. It can also be found here, but it`s in Swedish so I doubt anyone has any use for it (naturally you can look at the graphs and ask me about the caption, allthough it seems like an awfoul lot of trouble :p )\n \n \n Edit: long text",
