Of course, I dont hang out in photo shops, they may have one on the market now that will take my old lens .\n\n \n Quote from reviews:\n \n ~The sensor technologies do have different needs to film, but I think the issue is the size of sensors and other techno-design issues, than the angle the light needs to hit ... if you think about it, the angle the light hits the sensor is exactly the same as if it hit film. It is just that the size of the sensor is different and thus (I assume) placed on a different plane to where film would be. \n \n You can use all the Canon EF lenses (I use all mine, some of which I have had for a long time) on the 10D or even 1Ds and Ef and EF-S on the 300D/Rebel. You can use most (if not all) of the Nikkor lenses with the Nikon D70 or D100 or Kodak ~\n \n Other major players, including Canon, all have digital lens and flash lines for their digital SLRs. Even Soligar, one of the larger aftermarket lens manufacturers, is already out with new digital lens and flash products for the majors. While the sensor issue is debatable on other than low-end digital SLRs, most people I've spokem with prefer to use newer digital lenses than the smaller sensor film lenses. \n \n I have a big bag of expensive Nikkor lenses collecting dust that, after going to digital SLR, I'll probably never again use. Pure consumerism, but I like digital SLR quality and convenience well enough that it doesn't bother me. I'll just store them with old tax records so I don't have to look at them.",
