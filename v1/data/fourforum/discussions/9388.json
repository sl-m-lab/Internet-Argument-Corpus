   "I would like to make the distinction that religion causes war, not God or the bible;\n \n When nations go to war and military forces clash on the battlefield, where does God stand? Brazen assertions by political and religious leaders have raised grave doubts in the minds of many; yes, some wonder if God is even interested in the affairs of men. In point is the statement in the Muncie, Indiana, Star, of March, 1952, which said: \"Bishop sees God using U. S. to win world back to freedom.\" While we consider that claim, it is also interesting to note that during the second world war while prayers for a victorious peace arose from the churches in the United States, equally fervent prayers for the success of the Axis powers were offered up by the leaders of some of those same religious organizations in Germany and her allies. Surely God is not on both sides. What is God's position in time of war?\n \n God's dealings with his creatures are governed by his outstanding attributes o wisdom, justice, love and power. (Deut. 32:4; Ps. 104:24; 62:11; 1#John 4:8) Such have certainly been manifest in the deliverances he has brought about for his people. In the sixteenth century before Christ God heard the anguished cry of the children of Israel under totalitarian bondage in Egypt and in defiance of Egypt's pagan gods and its military power he manifested his power by delivering them. They had no claim on God, but he justly was their Owner, their Redeemer. As he reminded them when they gathered at the foot of Mount Sinai in the third month after their exodus from Egypt: \"You yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians, that I might carry you on wings of eagles and bring you to myself. And now if you will strictly obey my voice and will indeed keep my covenant, then you will certainly become my special property out of all other peoples, because the whole earth belongs to me. And you yourselves will become to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.\" And he further counseled them: \"You must never have any other gods against my face.\"-Ex. 19:4-6; 20:3, NW.\n \n With those principles to guide them, they became known as the nation God fought for. He thus showed his love for them by favoring them, and the wisdom of his actions was manifest in that it all worked for the furtherance of his purpose. As he had declared to Pharaoh through his spokesman Moses a short time before: \"In fact, for this cause I have kept you in existence, for the sake of showing you my power and in order to have my name declared in all the earth.\" And surely God's miraculous deliverance of his people Israel through the Red Sea and his destruction of the Egyptian hosts did demonstrate his power and caused him to be talked about and his name to be known far and wide.-Ex. 9:16; Josh. 2:10, 11, NW.\n \n But can we say that one deliverance on behalf of the nation proved that God would continue to deliver each individual in the nation? No; because three thousand men of those saved through the Red Sea were later destroyed for engaging in rebellious idolatry while Moses was away in the mountain. (Ex. 32:1-4, 27, 28) Nor can we say that God's fighting for the nation once, or often, meant that he would always do so. He delivered the nation of Israel from Egypt, he saved them from the Philistine forces when David was a lad, he fought for them against Midian, and again against the combined forces of Ammon, Moab and Mount Seir; but in 607 B.C. when the Babylonian forces of Nebuchadnezzar wheeled into position against Jerusalem their prayers for deliverance availed them nothing. Why? Because they were not acting consistent with their prayers. They were not keeping the covenant God had made with them; they did not 'obey his voice.'-Ex. 14:30; 1#Sam. 17:46; Judg. 7:19-23; 2#Chron. 20:22, 23; Jer. 9:12-16.\n \n Yet God had previously delivered them when they were actually provoking him. When in the wilderness on their way out of Egypt, after having witnessed the glorious power of Jehovah in executing the ten plagues, \"the sons of Israel got quite afraid and began to cry out to Jehovah. And they began to say to Moses: 'Is it because there are no burial places at all in Egypt that you have taken us here to die in the wilderness? What is this that you have done to us in leading us out of Egypt? Is this not the word we spoke to you in Egypt, saying, \"Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians\"? For it is better for us to serve the Egyptians than for us to die in the wilderness.'\" As the psalmist later recounted the event: \"Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy loving-kindnesses, but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea. Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.\"-Ex. 14:10-12, NW; Ps. 106:7, 8, AS.\n \n Was the rebelliousness of some unappreciative men to be permitted to change the purpose of God? Certainly not. He had promised in Eden that he would raise up a Seed or deliverer; to Abraham he had foretold that the promised One would be one of his descendants; and the family head Judah was prophetically assured that that one would come through his line. (Gen. 3:15; 22:15-18; 49:10) This arrangement of God to extend blessings to all the nations of the earth was not to be turned back. \"So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.\" (Isa. 55:11, AS) So the psalmist points to God's wisdom when he says: \"Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake.\" This underscores the vindication of God's name and purpose as being of far greater importance than the destiny of any men or nations of earth. That generation of Israelites was destroyed and did not enter the Promised Land, because of continued disobedience, but God's purpose had not failed.\n \n THIS WORLD IS NOT GOD'S\n \n Keeping in mind our brief review of God's dealings with his people in times past, we shall find that a few more statements from his Word make his position in relation to the factions of this world very plain. Christ Jesus in prayer to his Father said: \"I came out as your representative.\" And when he spoke, it was 'not of his own originality,' but he talked of the things he had seen and heard from his Father in heaven. He said of the Kingdom, which is given him by God, \"My kingdom is no part of this world. .#.#. my kingdom is not from this source.\" However, the apostle Paul identified the one controlling this world when he pointed to Satan the Devil as the \"god of this system of things.\" And Jesus himself said: \"The ruler of the world is coming. And yet he has no hold on me.\" Surely if the god or ruler of this world has no hold on Jesus, neither do any of the divided factions of his world organization. He is not on their side, and neither is his Father, for Jesus clearly said, \"I and the Father are one.\"-John 17:8; 14:10; 18:36; 2#Cor. 4:4; John 14:30; 10:30, NW; Dan. 7:13, 14.\n \n Oblivious to these Scriptural facts, Dr.#Billington of the Akron, Ohio, Baptist Temple, when speaking of the war in Korea, said: \"Drop the A-bomb and stop it. God gave it to us. Let's use it to protect our Bibles, churches, schools and America's way of life.\" But if God gave it to the United States, who gave it to Russia? Would it not be more reasonable, and Scriptural, to say that the \"ruler of the world\" made it accessible to both sides, because both, as part of his world, are part of his divided and confused organization? Adding further to the religious confusion on the subject, Monsignor W. T. Green, speaking in St.#Patrick's Cathedral in New York city, said: 'War is part of God's plan to populate the kingdom of heaven.' If that is so, then why pray for the return of loved ones from the front? Indeed, why pray for peace at all? Obviously, the whole effort to drag God into the conflict is based on specious reasoning.\n \n After all, are any of the nations really Christian, so they can claim that God is with them? Since nearly all claim theirs as the way to security and prosperity, do they conform to the requirements set out at 2#Chronicles 20:20 (AS): \"Believe in Jehovah your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper\"? The pagan world admittedly and openly does not believe God or his prophets, but what of a lot of Christians today? Not only do they fail to believe in God, but they try to keep others from learning of him. Why, in the new Revised Standard Version of the Bible the translators have tried to make him a nameless \"God\" or \"Lord\" by taking his name out of his own Book, and then the religious world persecutes those who bear that name. They have fallen into the class \"having a form of godly devotion but proving false to its power,\" as they espouse the evolution theory and teach that \"man was not a special creation but has been developed from the ape.\" (2#Tim. 3:5, NW) Jesus said: \"Broad and spacious is the road leading off into destruction, and many are the ones going in through it; whereas narrow is the gate and cramped the road leading off into life, and few are the ones finding it.\" (Matt. 7:13, 14, NW) But most modern-day Christians, together with its political leaders, has embraced the line of interfaith and thereby accepts in religious brotherhood all who practice religion, no matter how degrading its form, in all the world.\n \n \"But to the wicked God says: 'What right have you to recount my statutes, and to take my covenant upon your lips? For you hate instruction, and you cast my words behind you! If you see a thief, you are friendly with him; and you make common cause with adulterers. You charge your mouth with evil, and your tongue frames up deceit. You sit down and speak against your brother, against the son of your mother you utter slander. These things you have done and am I to be silent? You thought that I was just like yourself! I will correct you and set it forth in your sight.'\" (Ps. 50:16-21, AT) In his own Word God plainly tells them that he is not in league with them and that he has no part in their wicked practices.\n \n POSITION OF WORLD'S RELIGION\n \n No matter what the faction, someone seems to be ready to proclaim that God is with it. But do these public proclamations and prayers gain the friendship and favor of God? Do they assure that he is on their side? Rather, his Word tells us at James 4:4 (NW): \"Do you not know that the friendship with the world is enmity with God? Whoever, therefore, wants to be a friend of the world is constituting himself an enemy of God.\" So instead of making friends with God, they are making friends with the world by lauding and supporting its schemes, and that makes them enemies of God.\n \n Instead of being eager to proclaim that they have God on their side or desiring to get him on their side, it would be far better for men to work to get themselves on God's side by studying his Word and conforming to its righteous precepts. Instead of praying for God to bless their political, military or religious systems, they should learn to pray with sincerity as Jesus instructed: \"Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified. Let your kingdom come. Let your will come to pass, as in heaven, also upon earth.\" (Matt. 6:9, 10, NW) They would do well to fix their attention, not on a new world-order supported by military might, but on the \"new heavens and new earth\" that God creates and that will last forever.\n \n CAUSE OF DISTRESS\n \n In addition to showing us the way of God's approval, the Bible does not leave us without an adequate explanation of the present world conditions. The twelfth chapter of Revelation clearly shows that since the establishment of the long-prayed-for kingdom A.D. 1914 Satan has been hurled out of heaven and down to the earth. \"On this account be glad, you heavens and you who reside in them! Woe for the earth and for the sea, because the Devil has come down to you, having great anger, knowing he has a short period of time.\" (Rev. 12:12, NW) And he has brought great woe, both in increased war and distress to afflicted mankind and in confusion in the minds of those who do not know the truth as to the purpose of God.\n \n We cannot say that the outcome of the world's modern-day wars is governed by God, when they are powered by greedy commercial and political elements. Love and justice are not factors in their execution, when God-fearing persons as well as wicked ones are destroyed. Surely it is not a demonstration of God's power or wisdom when high-powered explosives rip open and make uninhabitable large sections of the earth, which God 'created not a waste, but formed to be inhabited.' (Isa. 45:18) Nor do these wars serve to 'make his name known' because he has delivered his people or vindicated his purpose by fighting for the side of righteousness in them. No, because none of the factions in these wars are his people. He makes clear his rejection of their professions of devotion, saying: \"When ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.\"-Isa. 1:15.\n \n Instead of their demonstrating his divine attributes and purpose, man's selfish wars are a negation of them all. But the time is now near, at Armageddon, when God will fight for righteousness and \"bring to ruin those ruining the earth.\" (Rev. 11:18, NW) Then will come a peaceful new world in which \"the earth shall be full of the knowledge of God, as the waters cover the sea.\"-Isa. 11:9, AS.",

   "Symbiote I'm gonna argue with this one. Religion itself can be a motive for killing. Although it's true that religion can't kill (unless you believe that some people get smited by the Gods), religion can easily be used as a justification for killing without the other usual attachments. \n \n Case in point: Suicide attacks on the 7th of July (2006) in London. These attacks (ignoring conspiracy theories for the moment) were perpetrated in order to kill as many 'infidel' as possible. The bombers were not hoping or gain power, or anything material (at least I guess they weren't), and were instead striving for the religious promise of paradise after death. If that isn't religion killing people, I'm not sure what would be.\n \n Further examples include the Inquisition and the Crusades (as well as any historical Jihads, that to my shame I know next to nothing about)",

   "People have been murdered throughout human history for countless reasons. Surely the question is why should a religious motive for murder be singled out as being especially wicked?\n \n James.\n\n \n No, I would say the question is how likely is religion to motivate murder, or perhaps how easy is it to get someone to kill in the name of religion, as opposed to other motivations. A suicide bomber blowing himself up in a market is wicked regardless of motive, whether it be religion, politics, unrequited love, whatever. But how easy is it to get someone to kill in the name of God? History says, pretty easy. \"For the state\" and \"for God\" have been the two main rallying cries down through time, and the worst attrocities often have religious motivations. I think the fact that religion specifically divorces itself humanity may be the reason for that. When your government tells you to do something, you know that the primary source of the order is a human; falable as the rest of us. You're free to think the order is stupid, resist it, or ignore it. You also know that if you follow the order you're agreeing with a human, sharing in their decision, and so taking on some of the responsibility for that decision. With religion, on the other hand, the buck stops on God's desk. He's supposed to be infallible, no one can claim to understand his motives, no one can claim to know better than him. So when God, or his earthly representitives, says to do something, it's alot easier to simply do it, even if the order doesn't seem quite right to you. Questioning a human is normal, questioning God is sacrelidge. If someone earnestly believes in God, whichever God, then all you have to do is convince them that God wants to punish the non-believers and you're all set. You've got yourself a crusader, jihadist, torturer, murderer, suicide bomber, whatever you need. Ok, not quite that straightforward, but much easier than taking an otherwise average person and getting them to blow themselves up for purely secular reasons. The very fact that religious motivations are ineffable makes religious orders easier to follow when they seem questionable, since by definition they defy explanation. You're simply supposed to have faith that God knows what he's doing and follow his will.",

   "\n But you overlook the operations of free will and reason. It is no excuse under military law for a soldier to say he was ordered to murder a prisoner of war; he can and must refuse to obey an unlawful order. The same applies in a religious setting. An individual must use his reason and question any religious authority that encourages or commands him to do wrong. \n\n I am by no means over looking free will. I completely agree that people should use their reason and question religious authority. My point is that if you look at history, you see that people don't, or at least are far less likely to than when it comes to questioning other types of authority. There is some quality about religion that makes people less likely to question religious authority.\n \n \n\n Religious motivations don't defy explanation. Like other mental phenomena they are subject to the review of the intellect. Unless a decision is taken in the light of reason - which involves free will - no moral responsibility can be imputed to the agent. \n\n I think I'm misunderstanding you. You seem to be saying that if someone does something for a reason that isn't based on reason, faith for example, they aren't morally responsible for their actions. That's not what you're implying, is it?\n \n \n\n Religious murders are no more or less wicked than murders that are attributed to other motives. \n\n As I said before, I agree. I'm discussing the ease with which religion can be used to motivate murder, not the degree of wickedness of someone who kills for religion's sake.\n \n \nPerhaps your animus against religion prevents you from seeing that - at the very least in the Christian case - murdering an 'unbeliever' would be either a perversion of religious duty or in defiance of the commandment, \"Thou shall not kill\".\n \n\n I think you're illustrating my point fairly well there. Despite a specific prohibition against killing, millions have been killed by Christians in Christ's name. What is it about religion that people will kill in its name even when the religion specifically tells them not to? Don't you find that odd, to say the least?\n \n And you also illustrated my point in another way. I've been talking about this subject rationally, and yet you see animus in what I've said. It's almost as if discussing the validity of religion in any way is taboo. That rather supports my assertion that questioning religious motivations is harder than secular ones.

   "From a sociobiological angle, religions exist as pre-eminent components of all known human cultures because they confer survival value on the societies that practise them. This survival value must be such as to outweigh the substantial material cost that religious practise imposes on a society: imagine the manpower and resources that went into building European cathedrals or Mayan pyramids, with no material gain whatsoever.\n\n A religious sensibility appears to be a universal feature of human psychology. My grounds for suggesting this is the fact that religious beliefs and rituals have developed in every society and culture of which we have knowledge. I'm not a scholar of comparative religion, but I believe anthropological studies have confirmed this and you seem to concede the same. \n \n If the brains of human beings are hard-wired with a sense of the numinous, then the fact that cathedrals and pyramids have been constructed with great effort but without material utility, can be explained as expressions of a society's relationship with its God (or gods). A medieval cathedral for example was idealised as an appropriate building in which to worship the supreme being who had created everything: its size and beauty was (or is) emblematic of the relationship between insignificant mankind and an omnipotent God. I don't see any 'survival value' involved here. \n \nThe actual, as opposed to ostensible, functions and purposes which religions fulfill are numerous: legitimation of power hierarchies, unification of social purpose, sanctification of moral codes, for a start. And among them is the provision of a sanctified casus belli to justify and motivate essentially pragmatic and self-interested acts of violence and aggression. The Old Testament is full of it; and even today the US President can with apparent seriousness tell that us that God told him to invade Iraq.\n\n I would not deny that religions have been adapted to some of the social, political, and moral functions you specify. Religious sentiment has been pressed into many a cause both right and wrong. But I'm not satisfied with its relegation to the status of a mere motivation for human conduct and nothing more.\n \nThe religious 'moral precepts' that James talks about are always presented as eternal and inviolable. History shows that they are as malleable as any other cultural construct, and can be bent at will to fit whatever is expedient at the time.\n\n I don't want to misrepresent what you're saying but I assume you claim as a truth that moral precepts which are presented as absolute truths - thus transcending contingency - are merely expedient social constructs. There is a self-refuting relativism involved here which I expect you are aware of.\n \n James.",

I'm adopting a defensive manner.\n c). that I'm talking in an unreasonable way or 'morphing' off the subject.\n \n\n Sadly, not the case. See below for things just from this post.\n \n \n \n\n You keep returning to crimes committed in the name of religion. But you weren't prepared to identify which religion you were talking about, so I asked if it was Christianity. If you don't want to take Christianity as your example, then say so.\n\n I'm not talking about a specific religion, I'm talking about religion in general. You're the one who keeps trying to change this into an attack on a specific religion, instead of a discussion about religion as a whole.\n \n \n\n It's obvious that you can't or won't distinguish between religious principles that prohibit criminal behaviour and the fact that some believers deliberately pay no attention to the tenets of their own creed. \n \n\n In point of fact I did specifically draw attention to that distinciton. It was one of the reasons I found people killing in the name of religion so note worthy, in that it means killing in the name of something that tells you not to kill. I've said this several times; the fact that you haven't picked up on it is one of the reasons I don't think you're really serious about this debate.\n \n \n\n It's the religion I'm defending, not people who are supposed to be God-fearing but act like barbarians. \n\n Exactly. Instead of talking about religion in general you've chosen to defend your faith, even though it isn't under attack here.\n \n \n\n My sarcasm, if that's what you choose to call it, was addressed to your tone - which has teetered on the patronising from the word Go. \n \n\n \n This is addressed to anyone else who might be reading this. I've tried to have this discussion with others in the past. To date I've only gotten two responses. Agreement, or animosity. Is there anyone out there who disagrees with me, and yet can still discuss it without taking it personally? If so please speak up, I'd really like to hash this over with someone who won't turn the discussion into something personal.",

   "For those who believe the Bible, of course God has caused war.\n \n \n\n When you march up to attack a city, make its people an offer of peace. If they accept and open their gates, all the people in it shall be subject to forced labor and shall work for you. If they refuse to make peace and they engage you in battle, lay siege to that city. When the Lord your God delivers it into your hand, put to the sword all the men in it. As for the women, the children, the livestock and everything else in the city, you may take these as plunder for yourselves. And you may use the plunder the Lord your God gives you from your enemies. This is how you are to treat all the cities that are a distance from you and do not belong to the nations nearby. However, in the cities of the nations the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance, do not \n leave alive anything that breathes. Completely destroy them - the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites - as the Lord your God has commanded you.\n (Deuteronomy 20:10-17)\n \n\n \n And that is what Joshua then did: started warring against and killing everyone in the land that God had promised to the Israelites, all with God's approval. As one example:\n \n \n\n Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved from Makkedah to Libnah and attacked it. The Lord also gave that city and its king into Israel's hand. The city and everyone in it Joshua put to the sword. He left no survivors there.\n (Joshua 10:29-30)\n \n\n \n As another string of examples:\n \n \nThen Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Libnah to Lachish; he took up positions against it and attacked it. The Lord handed Lachish over to Israel, and Joshua took it on the second day. The city and everyone in it he put to the sword, just as he had done to Libnah. \n \n Meanwhile, Horam king of Gezer had come up to help Lachish, but Joshua defeated him and his army - until no survivors were left.\n \n Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Lachish to Eglon; they took up positions against it and attacked it. They captured it that same day and put it to the sword and totally destroyed everyone in it, just as they had done to Lachish.\n \n Then Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron and attacked it. They took the city and put it to the sword, together with its king, its villages and everyone in it. They left no survivors. Just as at Eglon, they totally destroyed it and everyone in it.\n \n Then Joshua and all Israel with him turned around and attacked Debir. They took the city, its king and villages, and put them to the sword. Everyone in it they totally destroyed. They left no survivors. ...\n \n So Joshua subdued the whole region, including the hill country, the Negev, the western foothills and the mountain slopes, together with all their kings. He left no survivors. He totally destroyed all who breathed, just as the Lord, the God of Israel, had commanded.\n (Joshua 10:31-40)\n \n",

   "But these are all cases of arguing the exception over the rule. Overall, the overwhelming moral code throughout known human history has been that murder is bad, along with the other examples I gave. These are not cases where morality changed or evolved, but simply cases where the absolutes of morality were temporarily deviated from by some people. \n\n \n This is somewhat fallacious. Murder has always been unlawful killing of a human being. Of ourse murder has always been bad. However, societies can get around it by not calling it murder, thus making it not murder in their country (maybe call it killing for god, killing them for their sins, capital punishment, etc.)",

   "This is tautological: murder is by definition unlawful homicide, so to argue that 'murder has always been seen as bad' is merely to say that 'unlawful homicide has always been seen as unlawful'. 'Justifiable murder' would be an oxymoron: when a society wants to justify deliberate homicide, it no longer calls it murder.\n\n \n Let me be clear: a moral absolute that has remained throughout known human history is that killing other human beings is a bad thing. For the mutli-cultural adminition \"thou shalt not kill\" to the very fact that every society and culture we know of in known history views the killing of each other to be bad, this moral absolute certainly exists.\n \n I think the problem here is that you view 'moral absolutes' as with having no possbiity for exception. That's not the way it works; moral absolutes exist, but there are times that people deviate from them, which accounts for you thinking that it is being redefined over time. And indeed some things do get redefined over time--there are aspects of morality that do fit what you are talking about. That is why I said earlier that it is really both. But there are also aspects of it that remain absolute--history has made this very clear.\n \n \nIf the Book of Numbers is historically accurate, what you are presenting as absolute moral prohibitions on murder and rape were not just 'temporarily deviated from by some people' but were jettisoned by a whole tribe on the instructions of their leader, whom they believed divinely appointed.\n\n \n I'm not arguing this from a religious standpoint (thought it CAN be argued that way), nor do I wish to debate the Numbers story here--it's a complicated matter worthy of it's own thread. I think these moral absolutes I'm talking about exist in large part because of humanity and our innate (perhaps genetic) propensity to do what is best for our species. Even many, many animal species often avoid killing other members of their own species--so they too have some degree of \"moral\" absolutes in this regard.",

The very fact that religion exists all the time without violence (more often in fact), but that violence exists in such a form only in its fundamentalist factions, makes that very clear. To some extent, I believe that this discussion is competely unnecessary, because it is not religion that should be queried regarding this, but rather fundamentalism as a problem across many belief systems.",

   "Just two quick points in support of jyoshu:\n \n 1). An instrumental view of religion represents it as a tool for managing and/or justifying purely secular purposes, and providing a means of moral intimidation of the masses. Such a view depends for its coherence on a judicious selection from the appropriate, usually historical, data that is believed will support it. But any selection will not be an exercise in objectivity - it will depend on intellectual assumptions and on subjective cultural determinants that will inevitably permeate the criteria. In other words, such a view will not be detached, 'scientific', and utterly factual. \n \n 2). Nobody, on this side of the argument, has defended the proposition that religious zealotry isn't an immediate or indirect cause of violence. What has to be understood - at least in the case of Christianity - is that crimes committed in its name are implicitly included in the prohibitions against being the cause of human suffering which are found in the teachings of Jesus Christ. A religious institution isn't morally responsible when its fundamental principles are violated.\n \n The discussion of moral absolutes is interesting, but I haven't time to contribute today.

Or so conventional 19th- and 20th-century Western wisdom would have it. Evidence put forth here argues that this convention is a conceit which does not apply to the West's own religious foundations. In particular, rules against murder, theft, and lying codified by the Ten Commandments were intended to apply only within a cooperating group for the purpose of enabling that group to compete successfully against other groups. In addition, this in-group morality has functioned, both historically and by express intent, to create adverse circumstances between groups by actively promoting murder, theft, and lying as tools of competition. Contemporary efforts to present Judeo-Christian in-group morality as universal morality defy the plain meaning of the texts upon which Judaism and Christianity are based. Accordingly, this effort is ultimately hopeless. \n It can be read at: http://www.lrainc.com/swtaboo/taboos/ltn01.html",

Many tribal societies apply their word for 'human' only to their own members. As mentioned before, a general proscription on killing members of your in-group makes good Darwinian sense in its own right, without being elevated to the level of 'absolute morality'.\n\n This plausible explanation is consistent with a dominant paradigm, but it does not show that killing or persecuting 'out-groups' reduces moral absolutes to a convenient fiction either here and now, or then and there. There is no moral difference between murdering an outsider and murdering an insider: both are wrong. And it's implicit in the example you've chosen that you are appealing to an absolute ethic of tolerance.\n \n Dehumanising victims prior to killing them simply adds another immoral dimension to the act of murder. A framework of morality is not dismantled in order to make \"good Darwinian sense\": its purpose is to guide human conduct by providing values for moral reasoning. If a species of eel has evolved the capacity to deliver an electric shock to potential predators, I can understand that natural development as having a 'survival value'.

And there is no impartial third place perspective, accessible to any rational person, that could be invoked to arbitrate on the issues at stake. \n \n (Despite what I've just said, perhaps the sources of moral frameworks and the theory of moral absolutes might be discussed with profit in a new Philosophy thread?)\n \n James.",

Yours and mine, perhaps; but if the moral code of the perpetrator's society declares the act acceptable - and in some cases it would declare it laudable - then our views are irrelevant third-party commentary. The idea that deliberate homicide must always contravene some absolute moral standard cannot stand.\n\n I believe the idea does stand. To categorically deny the existence of universal values which hold true for all societies, is to assert an absolute truth. The relativist reasoner in this sense seems hoist by his own petard. That differently situated people may judge differently is a platitude that may lead to the falsehood that contradictory views may both be true. \n \n I'm prepared to defend a minimal set of moral absolutes: the set would include as a 'test case' the proposition that murder is always a violation of the moral code of every society we know about, now and in the past. Incidentally, the set I'm talking about would not include undesirable behaviour which isn't a critical threat to social cohesion - though it might be proscribed on religious grounds. \n \n References to historical examples which appear to show murder as morally 'acceptable' at other times and places, do not demonstrate that the concept of murder is relative. They might show that opinions about values have differed at other times and places. But opinions can be wrong about values as they can be about anything else. That the present moral framework might be a deviant phenomenon in the long view, is absurd in my opinion. \n \n There is far more cross-cultural agreement about moral standards than some relativists are prepared to admit. Evidence attesting to an enduring consensus on the nature and application of many moral precepts, including the proscription of murder, could be cited from the ideas of Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, Kant, the Utilitarians, and from assumptions in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. (This is just an arbitrary sample from a list of authorities going across time and cultures). \n \n Those who allege to the contrary - that murder is a cultural variable and this proves the absence of any absolute moral standard - usually seek out an extreme or 'savage' case in order to make the argument. This of course brings us to the Aztecs.\n \nI apologise for resorting to MesoAmerica again, but consider the Aztec practice of waging war in order to capture young men for sacrifice. Our culture would regard this as morally appalling, and at one time typical western paternalism would have explained it in terms of the Aztec being inferior savages who knew no better. That is not, I think, a tenable viewpoint now: we can feel distaste for the practice and reject it vehemently from our own sense of what is right, but we cannot label it 'absolute wrong' unless we claim that our culture is guided a source of absolute morality that the Aztec somehow chose to ignore. (This, of course, might be your claim; I cannot yet know.)\n\n Allowing that the prevailing belief among the Aztec priestly caste was that human sacrifice was both necessary and right, doesn't make it so. We cannot even be sure that it was an homogeneous belief in Aztec society with no dissenting voices. There might have been a silent majority of 'citizens' who opposed, on moral grounds, what was being done in their name. That outsiders from neighbouring tribes were the victims rather than insiders selected from the local population, suggests that some sort of moral discrimination was made - otherwise why make the effort to capture outsiders. If questions of right and wrong weren't pertinent to the selection, wouldn't the most convenient human source provide the victims?\n \n In any case, unless there is an objective criterion (or moral absolute) by which to evaluate such behaviour, we can neither condemn it nor approve it. To condemn human sacrifice in the absence of an objective standard would be meaningless. The only reason why we can censure some human behaviours and approve others, is because we presuppose an absolute standard of morality.\n \n To put it another way: if murder doesn't always violate some absolute moral standard, our evaluation of it right now can be only tentative. Unless we have an eternal court of appeal on moral issues, there is no way of deciding whether our proscription of murder is to be preferred over the 'permissiveness' (in this respect) of other societies at other times. \n \nOne of our differences is that I do not recognise those 'conceptual categories' as being wholly separate. I see the evolution of culture - including morality and religion - very much in terms of its impact on human survival. Culture - the whole of our non-genetic inheritance - is the only thing that enables our species to survive at all.\n\n Your argument seems to rest on the explanatory power of the evolutionary paradigm when addressed to moral conduct. Thus: In order to survive in the natural world, organisms must adapt to changing conditions. By analogy to the process of natural selection, cultural forces produce certain behavior patterns that facilitate the survival of the human species. Those patterns, or some of them, are called \"morality\". \n \n But when morality is reduced to patterns of behavior preferred by natural selection for their survival value, then morality is not explained; it's denied. It becomes just a psychological resource in the struggle for survival. But the salient feature of morality is its imperative nature. Assessments of behavior, however, are descriptive. Since morality is essentially prescriptive - what ought to be the case as opposed to what is the case - and since all evolutionary assessments of moral behavior are descriptive, then evolution cannot account for the most important thing that needs to be explained, which is the incumbency of morality. Accounts of evolutionary processes that are appropriate in the natural world, do not show how the genesis of moral behaviour arises in the conscience and shapes human meaning and purposes. \n \n I've said as much as I can about moral absolutes for the time being, so I won't be returning to the topic - at least not in this thread. I leave the last words to you or anyone else who cares to comment. \n \n James.",

   "I'm prepared to defend a minimal set of moral absolutes: the set would include as a 'test case' the proposition that murder is always a violation of the moral code of every society we know about, now and in the past.\n\n I have already put the argument to jyoshu that since murder is defined as a violation, this means little. When a society wants to legitimise homicide it calls it something else. Your point boils down to saying that all societies have defined circumstances in which homicide is wrong and punishable. There is no absolute abhorrence of homicide per se.\n \nReferences to historical examples which appear to show murder as morally 'acceptable' at other times and places, do not demonstrate that the concept of murder is relative.\n\n That's exactly what they show.\n \nThey might show that opinions about values have differed at other times and places. But opinions can be wrong about values as they can be about anything else. That the present moral framework might be a deviant phenomenon in the long view, is absurd in my opinion.\n\n Nobody is calling our present moral framework 'deviant'. It's what works for us, and I'm not knocking it - merely arguing that it doesn't derive from some ultimate rule book that contains absolute rights and wrongs. And 'opinions' are viewpoints that individuals have: when a whole society subscribes to a worldview that radically differs from yours, it is more than just a matter of 'opinion'.\n \nThose who allege to the contrary - that murder is a cultural variable and this proves the absence of any absolute moral standard - usually seek out an extreme or 'savage' case in order to make the argument. This of course brings us to the Aztecs.\n\n They were a very successful and sophisticated culture. By our standards their behaviour was indeed 'extreme', and having been brought up in a modern European culture I for one would shudder at the thought of living their way of life. My reaction, however, is irrelevant to the mores by which they lived.\n \nAllowing that the prevailing belief among the Aztec priestly caste was that human sacrifice was both necessary and right, doesn't make it so.\n\n This of course is the nub of the argument: you seek to judge them against an independently existing external standard whose existence is the very thing I deny. Having been raised in a modern liberal democracy, you and I are naturally going to regard Aztec beliefs as alien and horrible. Our argument is about whether that reaction stems from our having access to a source of absolute values denied by the Aztec, or simply from our own enculturation.\n \nWe cannot even be sure that it was an homogeneous belief in Aztec society with no dissenting voices. There might have been a silent majority of 'citizens' who opposed, on moral grounds, what was being done in their name.\n\n With respect, I can't feel that arguments based on 'there might have been' carry a great deal of weight.\n \nThat outsiders from neighbouring tribes were the victims rather than insiders selected from the local population, suggests that some sort of moral discrimination was made - otherwise why make the effort to capture outsiders. If questions of right and wrong weren't pertinent to the selection, wouldn't the most convenient human source provide the victims?\n\n Questions of right and wrong were most pertinent to the selection. No-one, least of all myself, is suggesting that any society has ever existed without possessing a sense of right and wrong. The crux of the matter is that there has never been uniformity as to what constitutes right and wrong.\n \nIn any case, unless there is an objective criterion (or moral absolute) by which to evaluate such behaviour, we can neither condemn it nor approve it. To condemn human sacrifice in the absence of an objective standard would be meaningless. The only reason why we can censure some human behaviours and approve others, is because we presuppose an absolute standard of morality.\n\n Yes we do, and we always assume it's identical to ours. The fact that we assume it doesn't mean it exists.\n \nYour argument seems to rest on the explanatory power of the evolutionary paradigm when addressed to moral conduct. Thus: In order to survive in the natural world, organisms must adapt to changing conditions. By analogy to the process of natural selection, cultural forces produce certain behavior patterns that facilitate the survival of the human species. Those patterns, or some of them, are called \"morality\". \n \n But when morality is reduced to patterns of behavior preferred by natural selection for their survival value, then morality is not explained; it's denied. It becomes just a psychological resource in the struggle for survival. But the salient feature of morality is its imperative nature.\n\n Indeed: human beings seem 'programmed' to acquire moral rules, just as they acquire language: it's an innate drive. You might be familiar with Kohler's work on the acquisition of moral behaviour in children. The fact that something is an imperative does not mean it cannot be evolved and biological in nature: viz. the imperative to procreate.\n \nAssessments of behavior, however, are descriptive. Since morality is essentially prescriptive - what ought to be the case as opposed to what is the case - and since all evolutionary assessments of moral behavior are descriptive, then evolution cannot account for the most important thing that needs to be explained, which is the incumbency of morality. Accounts of evolutionary processes that are appropriate in the natural world, do not show how the genesis of moral behaviour arises in the conscience and shapes human meaning and purposes.\n\n They can, if 'conscience' is seen as an enabling mechanism for the enforcement of the culture's moral code. The survival value of morality is far too fundamental and deep-seated for it to be left to reason.\n \nI've said as much as I can about moral absolutes for the time being, so I won't be returning to the topic - at least not in this thread.\n\n That's a pity, because I would have been interested to read your replies to the above points.\n \n JH",

   "Though many laws are grounded in a moral code, legality and morality are not synonymous. If they were, then torture would be moral so long as it was legal. So even if we construe murder as being a legal act at some other place and time, that would not absolve the murderer(s) from moral censure.\n \n A couple of hundred years ago, it was quite legal to own slaves in South Carolina. It was 'justified' principally on an economic basis - it made the operation of cotton plantations and the like, profitable. So the slave-owners might have claimed that owning slaves was \"right for them at that time\". i.e. - it helped to construct a society in which the masters of plantations were able to prosper.\n \n Of course we judge differently and condemn slavery as an immoral institution. However, in making this judgment we implicitly assume the existence of a moral standard which applies at least to the here and now. But where did that standard come from? If, as the relativists say, moral principles are cultural constructs, then perhaps our present condemnation of slavery is only a temporary moral conviction that will pass away as other things do.\n \n Unless we assume the existence of a permanent code of moral absolutes that is external to our contingent society, there is no basis at all for making cultural comparisons or making moral judgments about the evils in our own history. Of course, cultural relativism allows us to be tolerant toward other cultures, but it provides no grounds on which to judge or evaluate other cultures and their practices. This may seem satisfactory when we compare language and customs or even forms of worship. But this non-judgmental attitude breaks down when confronted by monstrous evils such as slavery or genocide. \n \n It is difficult for us in the modern world to imagine that a primitive culture might value, say, treachery, deception, and torture. While we may not like these values, an ardent cultural relativist could not say these are wrong since they are merely the product of cultural adaptation.

If you want to talk about \"grand theft auto\" or \"larceny\" or \"fraud\", all acts in which one person steals from another, then you'd have a correct analogy.

With respect, your question makes no sense. Since, as Waxy and I keep pointing out, murder can only be defined as 'morally unjustified homicide', your question translates as 'Whence did we derive the idea that some categories of homicide are morally unjustified?'

By that, I mean I find it difficult to imagine a group of tribal elders ever sitting down together and saying, 'OK, guys, it's time to work out what our tribe's morals should be'. I suspect, instead, that the earliest moral codes emerged more or less unconsciously: some behaviours promoted group survival and propagation and became approved, others were deleterious and became proscribed.

In particular, why would you wish to make moral judgments on people living in societies with a sociopolitical infrastructure so very different from your own?\n\n \n Don't mean to unnecessarily rehash, but I don't think the divine argument is even necessary. IMO, I don't think a humanistic form of absolute morality is so farfetched at all. I think even if you remove the divine possibility, it can be argued that humanity has some form of absolute morality that it tends to fall back on. I think with every culture there is SOME degree of a moral view that says killing others is wrong. Call in evolutionary behavior to protect the species or whatever. It's still a form of morality that seems to cross all cultures in humanity. It seems to me that by pointing out how some cultures (such as the Aztecs) DID kill others, you are arguing the exceptions over the rule. To some extent I guess I agree with Kronos on this. (Stepping back now, getting very worried) Although he seems to be going one step further than the \"don't kill\" and also saying that \"helping others\" is also somewhat universal.\n \n That's not to say I don't subscribe to the view that the divine is a source of absolute morality. I'm just pointing out that it's not necessary to argue for absolute morality in humankind. It just seems to me that if there weren't SOME form of an absolute out there on killing people, the human race would have wiped itself out long ago.",

That's probably not coincidence because, as you say, legality comes from morality. The generally accepted meaning of murder no doubt has come about because of the way society views killing other people--exceptions and all. I never said, nor do I believe that simply \"killing other people is wrong\" with no exceptions. I think the exceptions (wartime, self-defense, etc.) are a PART of humanity's absolute moral view on this. In other words the moral view takes the exceptions in to account. And because that moral view was there, the legal definition of \"murder\" has come to fit the moral standard as best as possible.\n \n This is mostly a semantical disagreement over the word \"murder\".

The argument that the moral absolute has always been in place, some just chose not to obey it is unsupportable IMHO.\n\n \n Then it sounds like we view \"absolute\" in two different ways. Apparently you view the idea of absolute morality in terms of something that NO one can ever deviate from, and that humans don't have free will. To me, absolute morality is a standard that runs throughout humanity that some cultures happen to not follow as well as others. This may be due to ignorance or other factors. For example, oftentimes people of a culture look back on atrocities they commited and acknowledge it was wrong. Some of the people in the Nazi movement did this.

Our own criminal code has multiple definitions for murder, including manslaughter.

In what respects did it differ from ours? How do you know?\n\n \n Just a second, I've just got to get my flux capacitor charged up and I'll go back and ask them. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n I'm not an Aztec scholar, but for the sake of argument, let's say it's exactly the same as our modern criminal code, with the exception that killing people for religious sacrifice is A-OK, in fact, it's encouraged. I know this, because to the best of my knowledge, rampant murder was not a problem for the Aztecs, and those that commited the sacrificial killings were not subject to any negative repercussions as a result.\n \n Does that satisfy you? My point remains the exactly the same - the definition of murder changes, and is therefore not absolute in nature, and from that, there is no absolute moral law regarding the killing of one human by another, as what is deemed wrong has varied throughout history and cultures. \n \n \nA familiar slick response, but not an answer to the question I asked. Who says this is a \"generally accepted\" explanation? You've slipped into the tu quoque logical fallacy by trying to avoid giving the evidence I asked for. \n \n \n I say it is, and I maintain it's the generally accepted explanation among the scientific community. The evidence is of course circumstantial and intuitive, based on interpreting Aztec texts and other archeological evidence. You can propose alternatives, in the end, it comes down to which side the evidence better supports, I'm comfortable I'm on that side.

But you have not stated its precise nature. If the Aztecs arrived at the same conclusions as us, that helps my case for moral absolutes. \n \n \n I don't know it's precise nature, I can only interpret it based on my knowledge of their culture.\n \n Your bent here of trying to avoid the situation by pressing for detail tells me you've run out of arguments. How am I, or anyone for that matter, to know the EXACT nature of the Aztec moral code? How is that relevent to the essence of this discussion? Do you need an exact understanding of our legal code, or even better, our exact moral code (as though such a thing even exists, now or then emoticon_confused ) in order to understand the general morality of modern western culture? \n \n We know this - they practiced human sacrifice, they were a long lived and prosperous civilization.

I can't see that it would differ at all, in any respect, - so it can't be \"plastic\". That's why I pressed you for details.\n \n I did not introduce any suppositions about Aztecs into this conversation: I believe John Hanks did so a while back and I complained about it at the time.

There is no ultimate standard of right and wrong by which to judge culture. In other words, different forms of morality evolved in different communities. Thus, there are no universal ethical principles. What may be right in one culture could be wrong in another culture, and vice versa. ( I hope I'm not putting words in your mouth, so you can correct me if I'm mistaken).\n \n What you need to explain is how and why differences in morality originated. I assume you will have a sociological hypothesis that draws an analogy to evolutionary development in the natural world, which you believe necessitates the relativity of morals.\n \n Before we have any further exchanges, perhaps you could respond by confirming that I've given a fair summary of your ethical relativism.

So the slave-owners might have claimed that owning slaves was \"right for them at that time\". i.e. - it helped to construct a society in which the masters of plantations were able to prosper.\n\n \n Just to pick up on this portion of your post...\n \n Slave owners justified their acts in several ways. The economic argument you mention is one of them. Other justifications included that it was the natural way of the world, that blacks were inherently inferior and needed the structure of slavery to survive, that blacks were inherently inferior and therefore there was no immorality in subjugating them, that there were so many blacks in some areas that freeing them would lead to race war, and that God meant for Ham's descendants to be slaves. Obviously, no one used all of these arguments at once, as they are contradictory. \n \n It is noteworthy that at least two of these justifications for (what we believe to be) an immoral act are couched in the language of morality. I think this is the key because I've never seen a quote from a slave-holder saying \"Slavery may be morally wrong but it's right for us because of the money.\" Even Jefferson finessed the point by pushing for abolition across society. If he believed slavery was absolutely wrong, he could have taken a moral stand and freed his slaves, but (a) it was economically advantageous only if all the other planters also lost their investments and (b) he repeatedly said that he believed that blacks were inferior and a mixed-race society was not stable.\n \n I don't believe slavery was seen overall as an economic versus moral issue as you seem to imply here. (I apologize if I'm misreading your intent.) IMO, the difference between the various justifications of slavery and our view of it now are a good example of the evolution of morality.",

   "[To Ned] On the question of its morality, the relativist assertion I'm attacking is the claim that \"slavery was right for them in that place at that time\".\n\n Not quite, I think. I can't speak for all relativists, but I would phrase it slightly differently. The slave-owners lived in socioeconomic circumstances that made the enslavement of others both possible and profitable, and their culture correspondingly labelled it right and proper. As Ned has pointed out, this was rationalised in all sorts of ways, some of them religious. (One of religion's 'deep' functions in society, as opposed to its ostensible ones, is to sanctify important behavioural rules and render them immune from questioning.)\n \nI would deny this of course, and say it was wrong then as it is now.\n\n Of course you would, because you have been enculturated in a completely different society. From our viewpoint, slavery was and is barbarous. What I can't seem to get across is that making judgements on another culture's morality from a standpoint within a different morality is simply futile.\n \n Let me illustrate this. Every civilisation that ever rose did so on the back of slave labour. If the Sumerians, the Egyptians and all the civilisations of the ancient world had denied themselves slaves on moral grounds, we would still be living in a pre-civilised world. Is this what you would wish? History has happened; people in those societies behaved as they behaved, and either flourished or did not as a result. For us retrospectively to call the things they did 'morally right' or 'morally wrong' by our moral standards, when they did not live in our world, is futile.",

   " As I understand it, the core of your position goes something like this: Right and wrong can only be judged relative to a specified society. There is no ultimate standard of right and wrong by which to judge culture. In other words, different forms of morality evolved in different communities. Thus, there are no universal ethical principles. What may be right in one culture could be wrong in another culture, and vice versa. ( I hope I'm not putting words in your mouth, so you can correct me if I'm mistaken).\n \n What you need to explain is how and why differences in morality originated. I assume you will have a sociological hypothesis that draws an analogy to evolutionary development in the natural world, which you believe necessitates the relativity of morals.\n \n Before we have any further exchanges, perhaps you could respond by confirming that I've given a fair summary of your ethical relativism. (You may wish to amplify or qualify my description of your position). \n \n James.\n\n \n My biggest problem in this debate, and I stated it in my very first post, is that I don't believe there are absolutes in morality. And by absolute, I mean just that, as in - \n \n 15. absolute, \n a. something that is free from any restriction or condition. \n b. something that is independent of some or all relations. \n c. something that is perfect or complete. \n \n not a generalized meaning as has been suggested in this thread by others.\n \n I believe there are generalizations regarding morality that are essentially universal, ie unjustifed homicide is wrong, the problem is, it requires the modifier \"unjustified\", which is open to debate.\n \n In other words, something is deemed morally wrong, except for A, B, C, etc... scenarios, where it's deemed to be OK. It's this variation in what is deemed morally acceptable that is fluid through time, and IMHO, solid evidence for the position that there is no absolute morality.\n \n I essentially agree with the summary in your first paragraph, if during the course of the exchange I see problems arising, I'll bring it up.\n \n Regarding relativism, I do believe that to judge all other cultures, both past and present, according to our - ie yours, mine, \"the western world's\", etc.. morality is a precarious position. We can all judge, but who's to say we're right, or that our morals would not have been the same had we been there in that time and place? \n \n I'm well aware of the precarious nature of a completely relativist stance as well, ie the reductio ad absurdum regarding right vs. wrong. This leads to my personal opinion on the matter, which is to say that morality has evolved and will continue to evolve. In other words, it is unfair to judge the Aztecs (sorry :p), the ancient Romans, even the old South, based purely on our modern moral code. Their actions, to my mind, must be viewed in the context of history and their cultures themselves. We can, with our current moral code and understanding, define the practices/codes we find unacceptable, and move towards eliminating them in our modern society.\n \n I'm not sure why my explanation of how variations in morality are derived is a necessity? To my mind, it's every bit as solid, if not more so, a starting position than the assertion that morality is absolute, and all cultures should share the same, or very similiar, moral codes.\n \n As to my hypothesis as to why these variations in morality exist, I quite frankly don't have anything specific, I've never formally studied the subject. I essentially agree with the line of reasoning that morality arises from the basic evolutionary need for cooperation among a group/community, and therefore some form of code to regulate behaviour, among human beings in order to ensure their survival and prosperity. Variations in the forces affecting the necessity, and ultimately the purpose, for these codes - be they base survival or economic and political in nature, have led to the variation in moral codes that has been and are observed.\n \n Sorry, a little long winded.\n \n I look forward to your reply, as well as that of others interested in the topic.\n \n Waxy",

   "Thanks for your considered reply: I'm confident had we started our exchanges with your last post, I should have had no reason to be reproachful.:(\n \n \n By absolute, I mean just that, as in - \n a. something that is free from any restriction or condition. \n b. something that is independent of some or all relations. \n c. something that is perfect or complete. \n not a generalized meaning as has been suggested in this thread by others.\n\n I have no problem with your definition of \"absolute\". I'm not going to equivocate by claiming it has a different meaning from my point of view. \n \nI believe there are generalizations regarding morality that are essentially universal, ie unjustifed homicide is wrong, the problem is, it requires the modifier \"unjustified\", which is open to debate.\n\n Here, I do see a problem: If there are generalisations about right and wrong that are essentially universal, then wilful murder (or unjustified homicide) seems to be one of them. Whether a homicide is justified can only be determined on a case by case basis - i.e. when the justification for it is examined. A universal generalisation about morality of course applies not just to us in the here and now but to everyone else, in other cultures at other times, that we might want to consider.\n \n Regarding relativism, I do believe that to judge all other cultures, both past and present, according to our - ie yours, mine, \"the western world's\", etc.. morality is a precarious position. We can all judge, but who's to say we're right, or that our morals would not have been the same had we been there in that time and place?\n \n Not only does ethical relativism entail that we cannot make legitimate moral comparisons of different cultures, it also entails that we cannot make legitimate moral comparisons of a single culture across time - even our own culture - and we cannot judge whether a changing society is getting better or worse. Generally, though, we do think that we have made moral progress and ethical relativism cannot make sense of this.\n \n If we pass judgment, say, on the slave-owning society of America using our present values, then there has been moral progress. If we used the values of 19th century South Carolina to judge our present view of slavery, then arguably there has been a moral decline. There is no way, though, for the moral relativist to say that either of these judgments is objectively right or wrong. To do that we would need to refer to an objective standard, and moral relativism denies that there is any such thing.\n \nI'm well aware of the precarious nature of a completely relativist stance as well, ie the reductio ad absurdum regarding right vs. wrong. This leads to my personal opinion on the matter, which is to say that morality has evolved and will continue to evolve. In other words, it is unfair to judge the Aztecs (sorry :p), the ancient Romans, even the old South, based purely on our modern moral code. Their actions, to my mind, must be viewed in the context of history and their cultures themselves. We can, with our current moral code and understanding, define the practices/codes we find unacceptable, and move towards eliminating them in our modern society.\n \n Fundamental to cultural relativism is a belief that values change. But if the value that values change is itself unchanging, then this theory claims an unchanging value that all values change and evolve. The position is a self-contradiction. On the relativist's own principles, to say that a value is wrong can only be true relative to the values of some particular society, and not universally. So it is open to someone else to argue that such a value is not wrong relative to his own system of values. This leads inevitably to the extreme and untenable subjectivism of saying \" Well I think it's OK for me to do such and such, so it must be right\". \n \n Relativists often forget that, according to their own account, what they say in defence of their own doctrine is only true for their culture or some sub-cultural group of which they are members, and consequently that their doctrine invites its own rejection by members of another group. \n \n Another important concern is the resolution of conflict. If there are no absolute values that exist trans-culturally or externally to the cultural group, how are different cultures to get along when values collide? How are we to handle these conflicts? How do you suppose agreement was reached by many different cultures on the articles in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948? With no external reference points, ethical relativism is the route to the paralysis of all thought and all activity whether authorised or prohibited by the moral law. \n \n Unless we posit a universal moral law, there is no reason for courageous individuals to challenge cultural norms and fight against social evils. The emancipation of women, the abolition of slavery, the campaign for civil rights, were all examples of progressive reform which ran counter to some cultural values at one time. Reformers appealed to a standard of morality which was \"better\" than what was commonly accepted. Moral progress was made towards higher ends, but the ethical relativist would have no basis on which to judge the case. \n \n I think we had better leave the hypothesis about how morality originated and evolved to another post. I've said quite a lot in this post, and people get appalled when faced with acres of print. Maybe I've said just enough to indicate that ethical relativism isn't quite the closed case it's made out to be, and that objections to its conclusions are perfectly rational.\n \n James.",

What's more, it is impossible to use moral arguments against the prevailing social norms in one's own culture, no matter how good an argument you have against the status quo. Relativism deprives us of any means of raising moral objections against horrendous social customs, provided that those customs are approved by the codes of the societies in which they exist. To learn about the ethnic cleansing in Serbia or the massacres in Rwanda and be expected to pass no moral judgment on these events because what they did was \"right\" in their cultural context, is absurd. \n \nPlease elaborate on 'necessity'. Do you mean their existence is logically necessary, or that they are essential for the conduct of human life?

If right and wrong are arbitrary concepts that can have different meanings in their application from time to time etc., we are never in a position to make any moral judgment that escapes the charge of relativism - the deconstructive methods of which dissolve all solutions as remorselessly as they dissolve the problems from which they arise. \n \n Ethical relativism leads to absurd conclusions that undermine its credibility. \n \n James.",

If we used the values of 19th century South Carolina to judge our present view of slavery, then arguably there has been a moral decline. There is no way, though, for the moral relativist to say that either of these judgments is objectively right or wrong. To do that we would need to refer to an objective standard, and moral relativism denies that there is any such thing.\n That's correct.

I tried to say that plantation owners believed that their \"right\" to possess slaves was objectively right, and not that they believed in the relativism of the moral order.

An objective moral standard is necessary in order to settle the difference by reference to it. \n \nIn your post to waxy you actually make my point: That's correct.

Since emancipation in 1863 the moral pressure exerted by abolitionists and the civil rights movement has ensured that we can safely say, in 2007, that slavery is utterly immoral - isn't that evidence of moral progress in the last two hundred years? (And not just on my say-so?)\n \nQuite the leap here. I thought the two of us were discussing a topic and suddenly I find there's an army of logical-argument incompetents standing behind me. Where have I contradicted myself? Actually destroying an argument and claiming to have destroyed it are, in the words of mister Clemens, the difference between the lightning and the lightning bug.\n\n \n Not much of a leap if you've been following the discussion - which has inputs from several people on your side of the argument. I don't know what Mark Twain would think of it, but here's my line of reasoning:\n \n Let X = absolute moral truths do not exist.\n \n Moral relativists believe that X is true.\n \n But X is itself a statement about morality, and is either true or false.\n \n If you believe X is true in absolute terms then you refute your own statement that absolute moral truths do not exist. \n \n On the other hand if you believe that X is true in relative terms, then you have no grounds on which to refute the argument that X is false.\n \n James.",

I responded to your statement as follows:\n \nFundamental to cultural relativism is a belief that values change. But if the value that values change is itself unchanging, then this theory claims an unchanging value that all values change and evolve. The position is a self-contradiction.\n\n My emphasis, of course.\n I repeat: the bald statement that 'values change' is an empirical observation, and is not itself value-laden. It contains no judgement of rightness or wrongness or worth. The charge of self-contradiction has no foundation.\n \nThe alternative is not to claim anything as an absolute truth and to declare that all your value judgments are relative which leaves them open to the objection that they carry no more incumbency than mere transient opinion.\n\n History shows this to be exactly the case.

   "Here, I do see a problem: If there are generalisations about right and wrong that are essentially universal, then wilful murder (or unjustified homicide) seems to be one of them. Whether a homicide is justified can only be determined on a case by case basis - i.e. when the justification for it is examined. A universal generalisation about morality of course applies not just to us in the here and now but to everyone else, in other cultures at other times, that we might want to consider.\n\n \n I don't really know how to respond to this without simply repeating myself.\n \n Like I said, I think the general theme that unjustified homicide is wrong is essentially universal through time. The variation comes in when \"unjustified\" is defined.\n \n We can look back and apply our current moral standard to any group in history, but that in no way affects their moral standard - ie how they defined \"unjustified\". It just proves that the definition has changed or \"evolved\".\n \n \nNot only does ethical relativism entail that we cannot make legitimate moral comparisons of different cultures, it also entails that we cannot make legitimate moral comparisons of a single culture across time - even our own culture - and we cannot judge whether a changing society is getting better or worse. Generally, though, we do think that we have made moral progress and ethical relativism cannot make sense of this.\n\n \n What prevents comparison? I can look back in history, or at cultural practices today, and judge them according to my moral standards. It doesn't mean that I'm necessarily correct, but I can certainly choose to live within a culture that shares my moral values, or pursue the persuasion of others to share my moral beliefs. Relativism in no way prevents this that I can see.\n \n I truely don't understand why you've posited that the relativist cannot make sense of moral progress. There does not need to be an absolute standard of right and wrong towards which we are steadily marching, only a progression of the moral standards of a culture toward what we currently believe is a better code. We may very well be wrong, but as long as the concensus among those in the society is that moral code of the culture better represents the moral beliefs of the individuals that make up the society, that's all that's required IMHO.\n \n \nIf we pass judgment, say, on the slave-owning society of America using our present values, then there has been moral progress. If we used the values of 19th century South Carolina to judge our present view of slavery, then arguably there has been a moral decline. There is no way, though, for the moral relativist to say that either of these judgments is objectively right or wrong. To do that we would need to refer to an objective standard, and moral relativism denies that there is any such thing.\n \n \n I agree with this essentially. We can believe that we've made moral progress regarding slavery, and I do. However, I do not believe that I can prove that absolutely, especially in the context of history.\n \n \nFundamental to cultural relativism is a belief that values change. But if the value that values change is itself unchanging, then this theory claims an unchanging value that all values change and evolve. The position is a self-contradiction.\n \n \n I had to read this about 20 times lol.\n \n I agree with JH, I think you've created a strawman of sorts here.\n \n It has been observed that morality has varied over time, and that even the most basic of moral tenets ie, thou shalt not kill, has varied. Therefore, the assertion that there is no absolute moral code is not a value, it's a product of factual observation. If you can demonstrate to me, that there is one moral code that is absolute in nature across all cultures and time, then I would have to change the conclusion that I've drawn from the available facts.\n \n It's a bit of a stretch, but as an analogy, you're essentially trying to state that my belief that 2+2=4 is a value that I hold, rather than a demonstrable fact. \n \n \nOn the relativist's own principles, to say that a value is wrong can only be true relative to the values of some particular society, and not universally. So it is open to someone else to argue that such a value is not wrong relative to his own system of values. This leads inevitably to the extreme and untenable subjectivism of saying \" Well I think it's OK for me to do such and such, so it must be right\". \n\n \n If the ability for one, be it Rosa Parks or any of the other thousands of individuals, to stand up and say \"I don't agree with your morals, here are my morals\" was not present, how would morals ever evolve? If morals were unchanging through history, would be even be having this discussion?\n \n As for the extreme case, if you lived in a world of one, an equally extreme scenario, then sure, it would be A-OK. Things don't work that way though, morals are a cultural construct, and as such, are subject to the majority.\n \n \nRelativists often forget that, according to their own account, what they say in defence of their own doctrine is only true for their culture or some sub-cultural group of which they are members, and consequently that their doctrine invites its own rejection by members of another group. \n\n \n I don't \"forget\" this. I'm well aware of it, and I freely accept it.\n \n \nAnother important concern is the resolution of conflict. If there are no absolute values that exist trans-culturally or externally to the cultural group, how are different cultures to get along when values collide? How are we to handle these conflicts? How do you suppose agreement was reached by many different cultures on the articles in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948? With no external reference points, ethical relativism is the route to the paralysis of all thought and all activity whether authorised or prohibited by the moral law. \n\n \n Quite frankly, the same way they always have, with swords and guns. :) With each side claiming the moral high ground.\n \n I suppose it was reached by the agreement of all involved on a set of guidelines that fit with their current moral code. I also suspect there was some compromise involved. Further, there are cultures that do not recognize the declaration.\n \n \nUnless we posit a universal moral law, there is no reason for courageous individuals to challenge cultural norms and fight against social evils. The emancipation of women, the abolition of slavery, the campaign for civil rights, were all examples of progressive reform which ran counter to some cultural values at one time. Reformers appealed to a standard of morality which was \"better\" than what was commonly accepted. Moral progress was made towards higher ends, but the ethical relativist would have no basis on which to judge the case. \n\n \n No offense James, but this is nonsense IMHO. There's absolutely no need to posit a universal moral law in order for any of the things you've listed to take place, or to be justified.\n \n Simple self interest is enough to fight for these things. Just because it may be right for you, doesn't mean it's right for me. That's the essence of relativism IMHO. It doesn't have to be better, only different.\n \n \nI think we had better leave the hypothesis about how morality originated and evolved to another post. I've said quite a lot in this post, and people get appalled when faced with acres of print. Maybe I've said just enough to indicate that ethical relativism isn't quite the closed case it's made out to be, and that objections to its conclusions are perfectly rational.\n \n James.\n\n \n Fair enough.\n \n Waxy",

I was responding to your references in #149 to Serbia and Rwanda. It's a bit rich for you to accuse me of dragging them in.\n \nOf course one can always decline to pass moral judgment on some practice however hideous on the grounds that it happened somewhere else and a long time ago. However, on your own principles, there is no reason to expect that if the same practice offends your conscience because it's happening right now, your moral concern shouldn't be dismissed, by others, on similar grounds.\n\n But of course it would be. Moral values are transient and culture-bound. (Sorry - I should have said within the limits of my perspective moral values are transient and culture-bound.) Oh, and the grounds for declining to pass moral judgment are not only that it happened somewhere else and a long time ago ('but that was in another country; and besides...'), but that the socioeconomic conditions in which the society existed were radically different from our own, and applying the moral code of a totally different culture makes no sense.\n \n... for if ethical relativism is correct, we could not make sense of reforming or improving our own society's morals, for there would be no standard against which our society's existing practices could be judged deficient. Abandoning slavery, for example, would not be moral progress; it would only be replacing one set of standards with another.\n\n Absolutely. You're beginning to catch on.",

   "I don't understand your point here. I tried to say that plantation owners believed that their \"right\" to possess slaves was objectively right, and not that they believed in the relativism of the moral order. Had they been upfront relativists, they would have claimed that owning slaves was right only for them in that culture at that time. They did not.\nAbsolutely not. Because it said in the bible that it was absolutely their god-given right to own slaves--and to beat said slaves.\n \nIf you pass judgment on another culture by \"your standard\" (on your terms), it's open to the relativist objection that it isn't \"my standard\", and I've reached a contrary conclusion - so what can settle the question of who is right and who is wrong? An objective moral standard is necessary in order to settle the difference by reference to it. . . . \nI believe that humanity is evolving to a higher level of civilization. Some of us have already radically changed our beliefs about equality in regard to those of different colors, different ethnic groups, different religions, different sexes. Those of us who have evolved--or been brought kicking and screaming to the desired state--no longer view Africans or women as inferior to European men. \n \nSlave-owning was morally acceptable in some states of America in 1807. Since emancipation in 1863 the moral pressure exerted by abolitionists and the civil rights movement has ensured that we can safely say, in 2007, that slavery is utterly immoral - isn't that evidence of moral progress in the last two hundred years? (And not just on my say-so?)\nMoral evolution, at the very least.\n \nNot much of a leap if you've been following the discussion - which has inputs from several people on your side of the argument.

   "To John Hanks: My last post: it's very long and I hope you have the patience to read it.\n \n In answer your charge of 'pure obfuscation' (in Post #164) concerning what I claim is the self-refutation of moral/cultural relativism, here's how I understand and wish to criticise the sense of your position. The following three \"bullet\" paragraphs will, I hope, clarify my previous \"unsatisfactory\" efforts. \n \n 1.) If you say all truth is relative (including moral truths), then the statement \"All truth is relative\" would be absolutely true. If it is absolutely true, then not all things are relative and the statement that \"All truth is relative\" would be false.\n \n 2). Suppose you prefer to say, \"There are no absolute truths\" - which is an absolute statement that is supposed to be true. Therefore it is an absolute truth and \"There are no absolute truths\" is false.\n \n 3). But if there are no absolute truths, then you cannot believe anything absolutely at all, including that there are no absolute truths. Therefore, nothing could be really true for you - including relativism.\n \n The contradiction is obvious, and the claim also becomes hypocritical because the denial of absolute truth cannot be considered an \"absolute truth\". (We are not talking here about, say, the axioms of mathematics - which you could cite as examples of \"absolute truths\" to which you would give assent.)\n ....................................................................................................................................................................................\n \n Attempts to apply cultural relativism to moral problems only end in contradiction. However, here's another example concerning tolerance - a moral virtue that I assume you would be happy to endorse:\n \n Either a principle that seems to stand for tolerance ends up being employed to excuse intolerance, or the principle of tolerance is revealed to be utterly intolerant of any society that seems to lack the value of tolerance. If there are no universal moral values then we must tolerate all moral standards - so tolerance itself becomes a moral universal. In appealing to the value of tolerance, the relativist is thus treating tolerance as an objective value. But there are no objective values in the relativist's world. \n \n Cultural relativism is not consistent with human rights. It is not even consistent with the principle of sovereign nations that underpins the interaction between states under international law. Unless there's cross-cultural moral accord, there's no way in which an agreement between different societies can be reached on the fundamentals of human rights. If a criminal like Mladic (should they find him) who was responsible for the ethnic cleanising in Bosnia could defend himself by arguing that he and his accomplices were doing what they believed to be \"right in their culture at the time\", there would be no point in having the Court of Human Rights at the Hague. It could never convict anyone if it adopted relativist principles. But of course the judges at the Hague would assume a universal moral standard that applies just as much to Mladic as it would to Hitler, or to Pol Pot, or to you and me for that matter. \n \n Cultural relativism makes it impossible for one culture to learn from another (since by definition, both cultures are right already). It implies that the person who disagrees with moral relativism is just as correct as the relativist. But the truth of any principle does not depend on one's culture, race, educational status, or language. And the facts of cultural difference do not in themselves imply the relativity of the moral law. A diversity of moral beliefs hardly insures that they are all somehow true. If a tribal culture is scientifically wrong in thinking that the sun revolves around a flat earth, why can't the same culture be morally wrong for practising infanticide? Ethical relativism eliminates the notion of a moral mistake. \n \n Returning to slavery as my final example. Since it was judged \"right\" at one time in some societies, the relativist has to explain at what point slavery became wrong. Did the abolitionists have a sudden insight that revealed the moral truth? What did the abolitionists, a minority working against mainstream opinion, appeal to when they campaigned against slavery? They could not appeal to the mores of the minute with which they were out of sympathy, and which can be overturned at any time. So did they petition a Moral Court of Appeal that upholds a set of universal moral principles?\n \n I would emphasise that the weaknesses of ethical relativism include an inability to say that one moral framework is better than another, let alone to judge a culture as evil, and a failure to make sense of intercultural conflict. The relativist cannot solve problems of universal justice or human rights. Furthermore there is the difficulty of defining just what a culture consists in. Is it simply a set of beliefs and practices? If so, then why can't a group of psychopaths or sadists form their own culture? \n \n Anyone engaged in a consideration of rights and morals is obliged to reflect on how their own enculturation has shaped their views. People who still believe in absolute morals can be considered as rebels against the current postmodernist orthodoxy which goes so far as to not only deny the existence of an objective moral code, but also any epistemological objectivity in the methods of empirical science !!\n \n In my view, the universal moral law is accessible by the use of secular reasoning and is objectively binding on all rational beings. There is no need to have recourse to theology in order to recommend it. Most, but not all, religious people would also invoke divine authority as giving a basis for morality. I believe the foundation of morals rests on a Christian/Kantian view that human beings have inherent equal dignity, so that it is wrong to violate that dignity.\n ...................................................................................................................................................................................\n \n Nietzsche's Moral Nihilism: You have your way. I have my way. As for the right way, the correct way, and the only way, it does not exist. \n \n Kant's Moral Imperative: Act only according to that maxim which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.\n \n I'm aware that I could never make any case on behalf of moral universals in which you would see any merit, let alone find even partially convincing. But I know on which side I stand with respect to the values of Nietzsche versus Kant's categorical imperative. \n \n Perhaps no argument for any substantive philosophical conclusion is compelling. So if all I've accomplished in this discussion is to show that there are a number of rational objections to your denial of moral absolutes, then I'm content to leave it there. Please feel free to have the last word. I hope you'll address all the substantive points I've made in this post without irony or mockery. I shall not reply, unless of course you choose to make a personal attack. \n \n James.",

   "Great post, James!\n \n One of the most revered mantras of the liberal relativists is \"equality\". The net effect of this experiment was to elevate women via the degradation of men; promote racial equality by instituting racial-based preferences and reverse-discrimination; engender class warfare against people of means via their redistribution of wealth schemes (a concept centered in greed for other people's money, rather than rely on one's own personal initiative and work ethic); and elevate wickedness (sodomy, fornication, and other corrupt lifestyles) to the plateau of respectability at the expense of traditional Godly values. \n \n Along with the failed liberal concept of equality is the mantra of liberal \"tolerance\". However, liberal tolerance is not what it appears to be. It is a contradictory, partisan philosophical perspective with its own rigid set of dogmas. It assumes, for instance, a relativistic view of moral and religious knowledge. This assumption has shaped the way many people think about issues such as homosexuality, abortion rights, and religious truth claims, leading them to believe that a liberally tolerant posture concerning these issues is the correct one and that it ought to be reflected in our laws and customs. But this posture is often dogmatic, intolerant, and coercive, for it asserts that there is only one correct view on these issues, and if one does not embrace it, one may likely face public ridicule, demagogic tactics, and perhaps even legal reprisals. Liberal tolerance is therefore neither liberal nor tolerant. ",

   "1.) If you say all truth is relative (including moral truths), then the statement \"All truth is relative\" would be absolutely true. If it is absolutely true, then not all things are relative and the statement that \"All truth is relative\" would be false.\n \n 2). Suppose you prefer to say, \"There are no absolute truths\" - which is an absolute statement that is supposed to be true. Therefore it is an absolute truth and \"There are no absolute truths\" is false.\n \n 3). But if there are no absolute truths, then you cannot believe anything absolutely at all, including that there are no absolute truths. Therefore, nothing could be really true for you - including relativism.\n \n The contradiction is obvious, and the claim also becomes hypocritical because the denial of absolute truth cannot be considered an \"absolute truth\".\n\n This would be a devastating rebuttal had I at any time declared that 'all truth is relative'. Since I have made no such remark, and have absolutely no desire to do so, the argument falls at the first hurdle.\n \n My position is not that \"There are no absolute truths\" - that would be an astonishingly arrogant and presumptuous claim - but that there is no such thing as an absolute moral standard governing human behaviour. I back this up with emipirical observation only, and make no claim that it is a morally or ethically superior position to any other: it is not a value judgement. The charge of self-contradiction does not stand up.\n \nAttempts to apply cultural relativism to moral problems only end in contradiction ... Cultural relativism is not consistent with human rights ... Cultural relativism makes it impossible for one culture to learn from another (since by definition, both cultures are right already) ... Ethical relativism eliminates the notion of a moral mistake.\n\n Please excuse the clipping. I have read the whole of your post very carefully, and the excisions above are made in the interests of brevity and of avoiding repetition: I hope what I have left will indicate which points I am responding to.\n \n Effectively, they all add up to one huge appeal to consequences. A position cannot be declared logically false on the grounds that its being true would lead to unpleasant consequences. I have already indicated in post #154 that I do not regard a relativistic approach to morality as any source of comfort or boon to humankind: it leads, as I said then and as you have pointed out above, to uncomfortable and unpleasant conclusions. Because of this, I suspect that the world as a whole will continue to act as though morality were absolute, as it has throughout history. I and others happen to believe this is an illusion, but that is of little import in the larger picture.\n \nReturning to slavery as my final example. Since it was judged \"right\" at one time in some societies, the relativist has to explain at what point slavery became wrong. Did the abolitionists have a sudden insight that revealed the moral truth?\n\n That's a very interesting question indeed, and one to which I've given a lot of thought. To be honest, I think it's a more difficult question for the absolutist, since the plasticity of moral behaviour that it illustrates fits the relativist model so much more closely. However, I'll accept that it raises a question for my side of the debate as well.\n \n I will give you my take on the matter. (I'm sorry you have decided not to post further, since I would have been interested to read your response.) You will have gleaned that my view of culture is essentially an adaptationist one, and that I view a society's moral code as one of the ways in which its culture fits its operations and exchanges to its socioeconomic conditions. When a society had ready access to slaves, and when slave ownership offered huge material advantage to that society's advancement - both conditions necessary - its moral code would have little difficulty in accommodating slavery as a positive good.\n \n So why, in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, did it come to be seen as wrong? I'm not a historian, and can offer no more than a crude hypothesis. I don't believe the timing was coincidental, nor the location of the abolitionist movement: the England of the Industrial Revolution. Slavery came to be seen as an aberration just at the time it was becoming redundant due to the advent of mechanisation and the creation of a cheap, concentrated native working class. You refer to the abolitionists as 'a minority working against mainstream opinion', but I would argue that the mainstream pro-slavery opinion upheld it as an economic good, not because they thought they were under some moral obligation to own slaves. As Ned Buntline has pointed out, slave-owners could justify the practice on moral grounds - culture performing its adaptive role again - but the motive was economic; and as that motive disappeared, so did support for slavery. (It is significant that the initial abolition applied only to England - for the majority, slavery was still acceptable in the colonies, where machinery and a biddable native working class were unavailable.)\n \nPerhaps no argument for any substantive philosophical conclusion is compelling. So if all I've accomplished in this discussion is to show that there are a number of rational objections to your denial of moral absolutes, then I'm content to leave it there. Please feel free to have the last word. I hope you'll address all the substantive points I've made in this post without irony or mockery.\n\n Which is what, I hope, I've done.\n \nI shall not reply, unless of course you choose to make a personal attack.\n\n I don't believe I have, but hope you will reconsider anyway.",

   "I didn't mean to be gone so long, but my DSL provider felt otherwise. Since you've already said that you're not going to respond, I'd like to make a few points for the sake of completing what I had to say.\n \n First, a comment on clarity:\n \n \nI don't understand your point here. I tried to say that plantation owners believed that their \"right\" to possess slaves was objectively right, and not that they believed in the relativism of the moral order. Had they been upfront relativists, they would have claimed that owning slaves was right only for them in that culture at that time. They did not.\n\n \n Apparently we agree that 19th-C slaveholders believed in a moral absolute good of slave-holding. Which raises the question: in post 145 you said \"I don't think I gave you any grounds to infer that the slave-owners believed in the relativism of human values. I expect they did what they believed was 'right' for them at that time.\" I've high-lighted the words that make no sense to me. Whose view are those words supposed to represent? They don't represent yours, since you're an absolutist. We agree that they don't represent the slaveholders', since they were absolutists. They certainly don't represent mine or any other relativist, since there's a huge gap between saying \"slaveholders, because of their socialization, believed they were right\" and \"slaveholders were right at their time but not now.\" Were you addressing someone else's comment again? Is this a sloppy strawman? My point in post 150 (the one you were most recently responding to) concerns the high-lighted words. They obscure rather than clarify.\n \n \nIf you pass judgment on another culture by \"your standard\" (on your terms), it's open to the relativist objection that it isn't \"my standard\", and I've reached a contrary conclusion - so what can settle the question of who is right and who is wrong? An objective moral standard is necessary in order to settle the difference by reference to it.\n \n \n \"Settling the question\" is your interest, not mine. I accept that people have views different than mine. Unlike proselytizers, I feel no need to convert others. Pointing their logical errors is quite different than attempted conversion: I have no problem with absolutism as someone's belief, but I disagree when it is \"proved\" incorrectly (see below).\n \n \nSlave-owning was morally acceptable in some states of America in 1807. Since emancipation in 1863 the moral pressure exerted by abolitionists and the civil rights movement has ensured that we can safely say, in 2007, that slavery is utterly immoral - isn't that evidence of moral progress in the last two hundred years? (And not just on my say-so?)\n\n \n No, it does not. It is evidence of moral progress from our perspective. It is not progress from the viewpoint of the slaveholders. We believe them to be wrong, but that doesn't make us right. In addition, that's one issue of many. How many people see social changes of the last 50 years as evidence of moral decline? Are they right? Am I when I disagree?\n \n Also, your history is a bit off. Slavery existed in all of the states as of the beginning of the American Revolution and, in most of the northern states was eliminated through gradual manumission. New York, for example, had a few slaves as late as 1825. The Emancipation Proclamation of 1863, while important politically and morally, freed a small percentage of slaves. The 13th Amendment freed the slaves. Finally, there's a hundred years of Jim Crow, KKK, and institutionalized demeaning of ex-slaves and their descendants between emancipation and the civil rights movement, so to speak of \"moral pressure\" during that time is inaccurate.\n \n \n...here's my line of reasoning:\n \n Let X = absolute moral truths do not exist.\n \n Moral relativists believe that X is true.\n \n But X is itself a statement about morality, and is either true or false.\n \n If you believe X is true in absolute terms then you refute your own statement that absolute moral truths do not exist. \n \n On the other hand if you believe that X is true in relative terms, then you have no grounds on which to refute the argument that X is false.\n \n James.\n\n \n Putting aside the \"X\" trappings of logic, the argument is meaningless. First, as has been pointed out by others on this thread, relativists see no evidence of absolute truth. This is far from us believing that they do not exist. If your value system and logic are based on belief, good for you. Mine are based on empirical evidence. If we remove the word \"belief\" from your argument, since it does not represent my views, your argument falls apart. Your argument rephrased reads: Moral relativists see no evidence of an absolute morality. See - no contradiction.\n \n Second, you have yet to address why an absolute would exist. Why should it? You've pointed out how horrible you believe the world to be if there are no moral absolutes, but argument from wish-fulfillment is rather weak. Per our slave-holder example or the history of the Inquisition, many people who have been as certain as you of the presence of an absolute morality have been, in our estimation, dead wrong. And yet in post 145 you apparently made, unironically, a joke implying that the morality you accept will last indefinitely. \n \n Finally, and this has been pointed out to you before, the statement \"there are no moral absolutes\" is not a moral statement. It is a statement of observation of evidence. You can call it a moral statement all you want, but all that allows is for you to claim victory and close off future discussion.",

I just don't presume that they would apply to all people, everywhere and in all circumstances.\n \nAfter all, since there's no objective moral guidelines, then anything goes, because one person's view is just as good as the next person's. Which means that the next time someone walks up to you and slaps you soundly across your all-knowing snout, there's no objective basis for saying anyone did anything wrong.\n\n Let's see if I've got this straight. You claim to possess an absolute truth that is binding on the whole of humanity; I on the other hand merely state that I am going with what best fits the evidence. Now, EZ, which of us do you think has the 'all-knowing snout'?",

   "\n Apparently we agree that 19th-C slaveholders believed in a moral absolute good of slave-holding. Which raises the question: in post 145 you said \"I don't think I gave you any grounds to infer that the slave-owners believed in the relativism of human values. I expect they did what they believed was 'right' for them at that time.\" I've high-lighted the words that make no sense to me. Whose view are those words supposed to represent? They don't represent yours, since you're an absolutist. We agree that they don't represent the slaveholders', since they were absolutists. They certainly don't represent mine or any other relativist, since there's a huge gap between saying \"slaveholders, because of their socialization, believed they were right\" and \"slaveholders were right at their time but not now.\" Were you addressing someone else's comment again? Is this a sloppy strawman? My point in post 150 (the one you were most recently responding to) concerns the high-lighted words. They obscure rather than clarify.\n\n \n I expect slave-owners believed what they were doing was right in an absolute sense. I don't know for sure because I can't ask them. I believe they were wrong both then and now. That makes sense to me. No strawman here sloppy or otherwise - apart from the one you've invented. \n \n\"Settling the question\" is your interest, not mine. I accept that people have views different than mine. Unlike proselytizers, I feel no need to convert others. Pointing their logical errors is quite different than attempted conversion: I have no problem with absolutism as someone's belief, but I disagree when it is \"proved\" incorrectly (see below).\n\n Why do you refer to proselytizing? I don't give a hoot what you believe: I'm just trying to defend my own view. I have claimed that relativism is self-refuting but I have not claimed, which is impossible, that my belief in absolutes has been \"proved\". (I thought you were a student of \"strawmen\").\n \n\n Also, your history is a bit off. Slavery existed in all of the states as of the beginning of the American Revolution and, in most of the northern states was eliminated through gradual manumission. New York, for example, had a few slaves as late as 1825. The Emancipation Proclamation of 1863, while important politically and morally, freed a small percentage of slaves. The 13th Amendment freed the slaves. Finally, there's a hundred years of Jim Crow, KKK, and institutionalized demeaning of ex-slaves and their descendants between emancipation and the civil rights movement, so to speak of \"moral pressure\" during that time is inaccurate.\n\n Thanks for the history lesson - which was quite superfluous since my mention of the period 1807 to 2007 was (using slavery as an example) to illustrate a point about moral progress over the last two hundred years. I did not intend to give a chapter and verse account of slavery in the United States. \n \nPutting aside the \"X\" trappings of logic, the argument is meaningless. First, as has been pointed out by others on this thread, relativists see no evidence of absolute truth. This is far from us believing that they do not exist. If your value system and logic are based on belief, good for you. Mine are based on empirical evidence. If we remove the word \"belief\" from your argument, since it does not represent my views, your argument falls apart. Your argument rephrased reads: Moral relativists see no evidence of an absolute morality. See - no contradiction.\n\n Sure let's ignore the \"trappings\" of logic if we feel uncomfortable with them.\n \n You talk about a empirical evidence in support of your view, but you haven't cited any. I assume you refer to the observation that cultures over time have a diversity of beliefs and practices? This is a description of differences that does not imply relativism of morals. Ethical relativism is not merely the idea that different people have different beliefs about morals, which no one would deny. It is, rather, a theory about the status of moral beliefs, according to which none of them is objectively true. A consequence of the theory is that there is no way to justify any moral principle as valid for all people and all societies. \n \nSecond, you have yet to address why an absolute would exist. Why should it? You've pointed out how horrible you believe the world to be if there are no moral absolutes, but argument from wish-fulfillment is rather weak. Per our slave-holder example or the history of the Inquisition, many people who have been as certain as you of the presence of an absolute morality have been, in our estimation, dead wrong. And yet in post 145 you apparently made, unironically, a joke implying that the morality you accept will last indefinitely. Finally, and this has been pointed out to you before, the statement \"there are no moral absolutes\" is not a moral statement. It is a statement of observation of evidence.\n \n\n What kind of a statement is \"there are no mortal absolutes\"? You seem to claim that it's value free, but it's an absolute statement that's supposed to be true, isn't it? Does it mean moral relativism is absolutely true? If it doesn't mean that, then what are we arguing about? Does truth contradict itself? \n \n If all moral views are equally well-founded, then why do we have a right to punish anyone? Can we ever say that some behaviour is wrong? In order to say that something is wrong we must first have an objective standard by which we measure right and wrong in order to make a judgment. If that standard of right and wrong is based on relativism, then it is not a standard at all but an expediency. In other words, relativist standards of right and wrong are derived from contingent social norms; and as society changes, the norms would change and so would right and wrong. If right and wrong change, then how can anyone be rightly judged for something he did wrong - if that wrong might become right in the future? The relativist has abandoned the very concept of objective moral truth. It is all a matter of opinion because everything is relative, and there is, therefore, nothing objective to argue about and no good reason to believe one thing over another.\n \n You can call it a moral statement all you want, but all that allows is for you to claim victory and close off future discussion.\n\n You are trying to make a cheap point here: I have not claimed \"victory\". Read my final paragraph in post #181 addressed to John Hanks, where I say, \"Perhaps no argument for any substantive philosophical conclusion is compelling. So if all I've accomplished in this discussion is to show that there are a number of rational objections to your denial of moral absolutes, then I'm content to leave it there.\"\n \n And I really must leave it there this time. \n \n James.",

That makes sense to me. No strawman here sloppy or otherwise - apart from the one you've invented.\n\n \n You still haven't explained the meaning of your words \"I expect they did what they believed was 'right' for them at that time.\" Feel free to say those words were a mistake, but don't accuse me of creating a strawman if you're unable to defend your own post's logic. I didn't say you had created a strawman, simply that it was a possible explanation for your otherwise incomprehensible statement.\n \n \nWhy do you refer to proselytizing?

I have claimed that relativism is self-refuting but I have not claimed, which is impossible, that my belief in absolutes has been \"proved\". (I thought you were a student of \"strawmen\").\n\n \n First, I referred to proselytizing because we're on a religion forum and proselytizers are, pretty much always, absolutists. Second, if your claim has not been proved, then I guess it's just one relative point of view.\n \n \nThanks for the history lesson - which was quite superfluous since my mention of the period 1807 to 2007 was (using slavery as an example) to illustrate a point about moral progress over the last two hundred years. I did not intend to give a chapter and verse account of slavery in the United States. \n\n \n Yeah...why worry about factual accuracy during your discussion of absolute truth?\n \n \nSure let's ignore the \"trappings\" of logic if we feel uncomfortable with them.\n\n \n I'm quite comfortable with logic. I was referring to your pseudo-math use of \"X.\"\n \n \nYou talk about a empirical evidence in support of your view, but you haven't cited any. I assume you refer to the observation that cultures over time have a diversity of beliefs and practices? \n\n \n Actually I did, in post 144 directed to you. In any case, I refer not simply to different beliefs, but people with the common belief that (a) there is an absolute set of moral values and (b) their culture represents it or is closer to it than any other. That, to me, is empirical evidence that people will rationalize morality in any era and any culture.\n \n \nThis is a description of differences that does not imply relativism of morals. Ethical relativism is not merely the idea that different people have different beliefs about morals, which no one would deny. It is, rather, a theory about the status of moral beliefs, according to which none of them is objectively true. A consequence of the theory is that there is no way to justify any moral principle as valid for all people and all societies. \n\n \n Yes, relativism states that none are objectively true. Your \"consequence\" is your invention. The fact that you believe it of relativists does not make it a logical conclusion or an inevitable consequence. I could say that belief in an afterlife makes one hold this life less dear, but that would be a statement of a personal belief, not a \"consequence\" of others' beliefs. The vast majority of relativists have no difficulty leading lives with moral principles that they recognize are based on a relative set of values.\n \n \nWhat kind of a statement is \"there are no mortal absolutes\"? You seem to claim that it's value free, but it's an absolute statement that's supposed to be true, isn't it? Does it mean moral relativism is absolutely true? If it doesn't mean that, then what are we arguing about? Does truth contradict itself?\n \n \n You're assuming the existence of absolute truth in order to analyze an argument concerning absolute truth. That is the classic definition of begging the question. I claim, again, that \"there are no moral absolutes\" is an empirical observation. As such it is not \"an absolute statement that's supposed to be true\" but the best statement that I can make with the evidence that I have. Unless you have evidence I don't (and feel free to present it, any time), I don't see how you can do better.\n \n \nIf all moral views are equally well-founded, then why do we have a right to punish anyone? Can we ever say that some behaviour is wrong? In order to say that something is wrong we must first have an objective standard by which we measure right and wrong in order to make a judgment. If that standard of right and wrong is based on relativism, then it is not a standard at all but an expediency. In other words, relativist standards of right and wrong are derived from contingent social norms; and as society changes, the norms would change and so would right and wrong. If right and wrong change, then how can anyone be rightly judged for something he did wrong - if that wrong might become right in the future?\n\n \n This happens all the time, and always has. How many people have been punished for fornication (in the legal sense of sex outside of marriage), which our societies (but not all of us) now recognize as acceptable behavior? How many slaves were punished for running away? I said in post 150 that we make laws based on an average morality (perhaps I should say: an average morality of the law-writers) with the understanding that not everyone will agree with them. Does that mean all laws are invalid unless we have unanimity? Then there will never be a valid law. Why do you insist that everything must be valid now and for all time? We judge people based on the norms of the society we live in. We may be proved wrong in the future. As for having a right to punish people, I'm personally not a fan of anarchy because I believe most people (including myself) act better with structure, so I believe we need a society with rules.\n \n \nThe relativist has abandoned the very concept of objective moral truth. It is all a matter of opinion because everything is relative, and there is, therefore, nothing objective to argue about and no good reason to believe one thing over another.\n\n \n Nonsense. Using nothing but relative rules, we can create quite elaborate structures. Starting with \"I wish to avoid pain for myself, but I am willing to suffer some pain for future benefit\" and \"I do not have the means to live life in isolation\" one can construct a society. \n \n \nYou are trying to make a cheap point here: I have not claimed \"victory\". Read my final paragraph in post #181 addressed to John Hanks, where I say, \"Perhaps no argument for any substantive philosophical conclusion is compelling. So if all I've accomplished in this discussion is to show that there are a number of rational objections to your denial of moral absolutes, then I'm content to leave it there.\"\n\n \n Your repeated assertions that your opponents have contradicted themselves, which is based on nothing more substantial than mis-stating their arguments sure seemed like premature victory claims. For example, you ended post 145 with a claim that relativists contradicted themselves - no evidence provided - and \"it destroys the relativist argument.\" In my world, when one has \"destroyed\" an opponent's argument, one is victorious. I have repeatedly asked you to explain your own words (see the first item in this post) and to provide evidence of a relativist contradicting him- or herself. You have only provided your pseudo-logic \"X\", which does not represent my views or those of anyone else I've seen here.",

   "I would like to make the distinction that religion causes war, not God or the bible;\n \n When nations go to war and military forces clash on the battlefield, where does God stand? Brazen assertions by political and religious leaders have raised grave doubts in the minds of many; yes, some wonder if God is even interested in the affairs of men. In point is the statement in the Muncie, Indiana, Star, of March, 1952, which said: \"Bishop sees God using U. S. to win world back to freedom.\" While we consider that claim, it is also interesting to note that during the second world war while prayers for a victorious peace arose from the churches in the United States, equally fervent prayers for the success of the Axis powers were offered up by the leaders of some of those same religious organizations in Germany and her allies. Surely God is not on both sides. What is God's position in time of war?\n \n God's dealings with his creatures are governed by his outstanding attributes o wisdom, justice, love and power. (Deut. 32:4; Ps. 104:24; 62:11; 1#John 4:8) Such have certainly been manifest in the deliverances he has brought about for his people. In the sixteenth century before Christ God heard the anguished cry of the children of Israel under totalitarian bondage in Egypt and in defiance of Egypt's pagan gods and its military power he manifested his power by delivering them. They had no claim on God, but he justly was their Owner, their Redeemer. As he reminded them when they gathered at the foot of Mount Sinai in the third month after their exodus from Egypt: \"You yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians, that I might carry you on wings of eagles and bring you to myself. And now if you will strictly obey my voice and will indeed keep my covenant, then you will certainly become my special property out of all other peoples, because the whole earth belongs to me. And you yourselves will become to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.\" And he further counseled them: \"You must never have any other gods against my face.\"-Ex. 19:4-6; 20:3, NW.\n \n With those principles to guide them, they became known as the nation God fought for. He thus showed his love for them by favoring them, and the wisdom of his actions was manifest in that it all worked for the furtherance of his purpose. As he had declared to Pharaoh through his spokesman Moses a short time before: \"In fact, for this cause I have kept you in existence, for the sake of showing you my power and in order to have my name declared in all the earth.\" And surely God's miraculous deliverance of his people Israel through the Red Sea and his destruction of the Egyptian hosts did demonstrate his power and caused him to be talked about and his name to be known far and wide.-Ex. 9:16; Josh. 2:10, 11, NW.\n \n But can we say that one deliverance on behalf of the nation proved that God would continue to deliver each individual in the nation? No; because three thousand men of those saved through the Red Sea were later destroyed for engaging in rebellious idolatry while Moses was away in the mountain. (Ex. 32:1-4, 27, 28) Nor can we say that God's fighting for the nation once, or often, meant that he would always do so. He delivered the nation of Israel from Egypt, he saved them from the Philistine forces when David was a lad, he fought for them against Midian, and again against the combined forces of Ammon, Moab and Mount Seir; but in 607 B.C. when the Babylonian forces of Nebuchadnezzar wheeled into position against Jerusalem their prayers for deliverance availed them nothing. Why? Because they were not acting consistent with their prayers. They were not keeping the covenant God had made with them; they did not 'obey his voice.'-Ex. 14:30; 1#Sam. 17:46; Judg. 7:19-23; 2#Chron. 20:22, 23; Jer. 9:12-16.\n \n Yet God had previously delivered them when they were actually provoking him. When in the wilderness on their way out of Egypt, after having witnessed the glorious power of Jehovah in executing the ten plagues, \"the sons of Israel got quite afraid and began to cry out to Jehovah. And they began to say to Moses: 'Is it because there are no burial places at all in Egypt that you have taken us here to die in the wilderness? What is this that you have done to us in leading us out of Egypt? Is this not the word we spoke to you in Egypt, saying, \"Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians\"? For it is better for us to serve the Egyptians than for us to die in the wilderness.'\" As the psalmist later recounted the event: \"Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy loving-kindnesses, but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea. Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.\"-Ex. 14:10-12, NW; Ps. 106:7, 8, AS.\n \n Was the rebelliousness of some unappreciative men to be permitted to change the purpose of God? Certainly not. He had promised in Eden that he would raise up a Seed or deliverer; to Abraham he had foretold that the promised One would be one of his descendants; and the family head Judah was prophetically assured that that one would come through his line. (Gen. 3:15; 22:15-18; 49:10) This arrangement of God to extend blessings to all the nations of the earth was not to be turned back. \"So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.\" (Isa. 55:11, AS) So the psalmist points to God's wisdom when he says: \"Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake.\" This underscores the vindication of God's name and purpose as being of far greater importance than the destiny of any men or nations of earth. That generation of Israelites was destroyed and did not enter the Promised Land, because of continued disobedience, but God's purpose had not failed.\n \n THIS WORLD IS NOT GOD'S\n \n Keeping in mind our brief review of God's dealings with his people in times past, we shall find that a few more statements from his Word make his position in relation to the factions of this world very plain. Christ Jesus in prayer to his Father said: \"I came out as your representative.\" And when he spoke, it was 'not of his own originality,' but he talked of the things he had seen and heard from his Father in heaven. He said of the Kingdom, which is given him by God, \"My kingdom is no part of this world. .#.#. my kingdom is not from this source.\" However, the apostle Paul identified the one controlling this world when he pointed to Satan the Devil as the \"god of this system of things.\" And Jesus himself said: \"The ruler of the world is coming. And yet he has no hold on me.\" Surely if the god or ruler of this world has no hold on Jesus, neither do any of the divided factions of his world organization. He is not on their side, and neither is his Father, for Jesus clearly said, \"I and the Father are one.\"-John 17:8; 14:10; 18:36; 2#Cor. 4:4; John 14:30; 10:30, NW; Dan. 7:13, 14.\n \n Oblivious to these Scriptural facts, Dr.#Billington of the Akron, Ohio, Baptist Temple, when speaking of the war in Korea, said: \"Drop the A-bomb and stop it. God gave it to us. Let's use it to protect our Bibles, churches, schools and America's way of life.\" But if God gave it to the United States, who gave it to Russia? Would it not be more reasonable, and Scriptural, to say that the \"ruler of the world\" made it accessible to both sides, because both, as part of his world, are part of his divided and confused organization? Adding further to the religious confusion on the subject, Monsignor W. T. Green, speaking in St.#Patrick's Cathedral in New York city, said: 'War is part of God's plan to populate the kingdom of heaven.' If that is so, then why pray for the return of loved ones from the front? Indeed, why pray for peace at all? Obviously, the whole effort to drag God into the conflict is based on specious reasoning.\n \n After all, are any of the nations really Christian, so they can claim that God is with them? Since nearly all claim theirs as the way to security and prosperity, do they conform to the requirements set out at 2#Chronicles 20:20 (AS): \"Believe in Jehovah your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper\"? The pagan world admittedly and openly does not believe God or his prophets, but what of a lot of Christians today? Not only do they fail to believe in God, but they try to keep others from learning of him. Why, in the new Revised Standard Version of the Bible the translators have tried to make him a nameless \"God\" or \"Lord\" by taking his name out of his own Book, and then the religious world persecutes those who bear that name. They have fallen into the class \"having a form of godly devotion but proving false to its power,\" as they espouse the evolution theory and teach that \"man was not a special creation but has been developed from the ape.\" (2#Tim. 3:5, NW) Jesus said: \"Broad and spacious is the road leading off into destruction, and many are the ones going in through it; whereas narrow is the gate and cramped the road leading off into life, and few are the ones finding it.\" (Matt. 7:13, 14, NW) But most modern-day Christians, together with its political leaders, has embraced the line of interfaith and thereby accepts in religious brotherhood all who practice religion, no matter how degrading its form, in all the world.\n \n \"But to the wicked God says: 'What right have you to recount my statutes, and to take my covenant upon your lips? For you hate instruction, and you cast my words behind you! If you see a thief, you are friendly with him; and you make common cause with adulterers. You charge your mouth with evil, and your tongue frames up deceit. You sit down and speak against your brother, against the son of your mother you utter slander. These things you have done and am I to be silent? You thought that I was just like yourself! I will correct you and set it forth in your sight.'\" (Ps. 50:16-21, AT) In his own Word God plainly tells them that he is not in league with them and that he has no part in their wicked practices.\n \n POSITION OF WORLD'S RELIGION\n \n No matter what the faction, someone seems to be ready to proclaim that God is with it. But do these public proclamations and prayers gain the friendship and favor of God? Do they assure that he is on their side? Rather, his Word tells us at James 4:4 (NW): \"Do you not know that the friendship with the world is enmity with God? Whoever, therefore, wants to be a friend of the world is constituting himself an enemy of God.\" So instead of making friends with God, they are making friends with the world by lauding and supporting its schemes, and that makes them enemies of God.\n \n Instead of being eager to proclaim that they have God on their side or desiring to get him on their side, it would be far better for men to work to get themselves on God's side by studying his Word and conforming to its righteous precepts. Instead of praying for God to bless their political, military or religious systems, they should learn to pray with sincerity as Jesus instructed: \"Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified. Let your kingdom come. Let your will come to pass, as in heaven, also upon earth.\" (Matt. 6:9, 10, NW) They would do well to fix their attention, not on a new world-order supported by military might, but on the \"new heavens and new earth\" that God creates and that will last forever.\n \n CAUSE OF DISTRESS\n \n In addition to showing us the way of God's approval, the Bible does not leave us without an adequate explanation of the present world conditions. The twelfth chapter of Revelation clearly shows that since the establishment of the long-prayed-for kingdom A.D. 1914 Satan has been hurled out of heaven and down to the earth. \"On this account be glad, you heavens and you who reside in them! Woe for the earth and for the sea, because the Devil has come down to you, having great anger, knowing he has a short period of time.\" (Rev. 12:12, NW) And he has brought great woe, both in increased war and distress to afflicted mankind and in confusion in the minds of those who do not know the truth as to the purpose of God.\n \n We cannot say that the outcome of the world's modern-day wars is governed by God, when they are powered by greedy commercial and political elements. Love and justice are not factors in their execution, when God-fearing persons as well as wicked ones are destroyed. Surely it is not a demonstration of God's power or wisdom when high-powered explosives rip open and make uninhabitable large sections of the earth, which God 'created not a waste, but formed to be inhabited.' (Isa. 45:18) Nor do these wars serve to 'make his name known' because he has delivered his people or vindicated his purpose by fighting for the side of righteousness in them. No, because none of the factions in these wars are his people. He makes clear his rejection of their professions of devotion, saying: \"When ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.\"-Isa. 1:15.\n \n Instead of their demonstrating his divine attributes and purpose, man's selfish wars are a negation of them all. But the time is now near, at Armageddon, when God will fight for righteousness and \"bring to ruin those ruining the earth.\" (Rev. 11:18, NW) Then will come a peaceful new world in which \"the earth shall be full of the knowledge of God, as the waters cover the sea.\"-Isa. 11:9, AS.\n\n \n I must say, this is the first time I even looked at this thread and read the opening post and I'm very impressed with your complete argument that it is the god of this World, not the God of Creation who is the cause of arming and creating the conflicts that have lead to all of the Wars in History, in so much that he has raised up evil and cruel leaders who have created the conflicts that precipitated the need to remove them or simply neutralize them as a National threat to their neighbors. So although I totally agree that the God of love doesn't cause War, I understand that War is sometimes necessary if good is to keep evil in this World in check and from running rampant.",

   "No it isn't. Communism is an atheistic Political System that fears religion because people who are liberated by faith in God will never submit to a Totalitarian Government that seeks to control the thoughts and actions of its citizens through fear and intimidation. That's why the USSR wouldn't allow any religious expression other than the State Sanctioned Beliefs of the Russian Orthodox Church which supported the Soviet Communist doctrine.\n\n \n Perhaps you should read your posts before you post them in the future? (not to mention not talk about things you do not understand, which is quite alot). \n \n Communism is a political and economic system of complete equality. It it essentially a democracy of the worker, where all the workers favor common control and common ownership. The leaders of the nation are the people and everyone is equally well off. Notice that has yet to happen on this planet to a nation. If the democracy of the worker decides to get rid of religion it can. If it chooses to allow different religions it can. \n \n The USSR was not Communist. A Communist country CANNOT be run by a few men. A Communist Country is by definition not a Dictatorship. The only actual Communist groups are found in the Andes or the African Jungle in small groups which apparently have religious beliefs that fall within Animism. The USSR got rid of religion because it interfered with the control of the country by the few in power in the party.",

How free is a child or young adult who has been institutionalized to believe that this is true? That it is RIGHT to join in because the leaders and your parents say so, even though your gut instinct tells you something's not right.\n Even the example given by the Christ can be used to show this manipulation when he tells the rich man to give it all up to be perfect or he can't enter the kingdom.

   "Like OC stated, this ignores basically everything written by Marx and Engels.\n \n What is described here is basically Stalinism, where the power is held by the few and the State controls everything. Stalin basically said the USSR was in transition to Socialism and then Communism, this was disputed by Trotsky and others on the Left of the Bolshevik Party(read The Revolution Betrayed by Trotsky for a more detailed but biased explanation why the USSR was not a Communist State).\n\n The essence of communism is a social and economic arrangement defined by the fact that no participant owns significantly more than any other - either because all property is held in common or because the institution of private property doesn't exist. Communes are utopian societies and true communism is incompatible with any form of exchange value. Marx's variation on this theme declares that ownership is confined to the means of consumption and is excluded from the means of production and exchange. \n \n But \"primitive\" communism should be distinguished from socialism which is a socio-economic order in which property is not owned in common, but by some impersonal and autonomous body such as the state. (e.g. nationalisation of industries etc. )\n \n According to Karl Marx, socialism is a stage of development on the road to full communism - which is why his disciples frequently make a distinction between the two. The characteristic slogan of Marx's communism is, \"From each according to his ability, to each according to his need\". \n \n James.",

   "This is odd: in past conversations you seem to have been quite regular in your habit of condemning religion on the grounds that (among other detriments) it has a history of horrors. Now you say that when it causes wars etc., it's not blameworthy because it's merely fulfilling one of its instrumental functions.\n\n Actually, I've always claimed that religion doesn't cause wars - it merely justifies and sanctifies wars waged for more materialistic motives. But perhaps I expressed myself badly.

   "And I learned what Communism is from a political scientists/historian who spent decades studying Communism and the USSR. You cannot break Communism down into a simple definition and expect to understand it. It is a complicated subject. \n \n The definition is poor for the untrained. Furthermore, that definition ignores a a huge amount of what Marx actually wrote. That definition is more accurately attributed to lower case communism rather then Communism of the Marx type. \n \n It is technically right in that the proletariat is the authoritarian party and the party is the state. Notice how I stated that. The rule is by democracy, only there the democracy is made up of a absolute majority of the proletariat.\n \n Your inability to understand this would suggest that you are like most Americans: ignorant of what Communism actually is.\n\n \n So nice that you result to personal attacks and provide no evidence. I have produced a definition based on the context of the conversation that was ongoing.

Perhaps you should consult Marx as to what Communism actually us. Frankly, I don't expect many people to understand Communism, but many to think they do. You cannot have a Communist Dictatorship as Communism is run by the masses!\n \n \nThis is vague and does not assist in the discussion.\n\n \n In your opinion. It was a comment that simplistic arguments about complex subjects are stupid. \n \n \nPlease provide a reasonable definition. Saying you cannot define it for purposes of discussion is ludicrous.\n\n \n Where did I say I never could define it? \n \n This isn't bad, but it could use some work\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism\n \n Every nation that has been called Communism has failed to meet its more basic requirements. There has NEVER been a revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat. There have been revolutions in charismatic leaders who enjoy significant luxuries over the common people using the common people. But there has never been the primary and vital and fundamental step towards Communism. \n \n \nThe point is that it is not a political system (type of national governance and organization) nor is it religious or antireligious, it is a system of economics where in all individuals own everything equally.\n\n \n It is also a system in which all individuals rule equally as well as part of the proletariat. That is a political system. Who has the power in making policies. \n \n \nThe authoritarian rule is there only to establish order and force the economics because people, by nature, will not do it on their own.\n\n \n In non-Communistic countries yes. In a true Communist country as defined by Marx, that authoritarian rule is direct product of the democratic actions of the \n proletariat. The proletariat are the party and the party is the state. (hence another reason why Communism has failed before it even got off the ground). \n \n \nMy point still stands, saying that it is too complicated to define (marxism is not communism by the way, it is more socialist in economic policy) does nothing to that point.\n\n \n Whoa there. You're saying that the founder and author of the ideology of Communism does not get to define Communism? Marxism clearly defines who rules within a Communist country. Are you saying that those who do define policy are not part of the political process? \n \n That'd wild (and quite crazy). \n \n \nMy definition does not have to be all inclusive to make the point I made.\n\n \n But it does need to be correct in definition the subject. There is where your problem lies. \n \n You can call anything Communist you want (and people do), it just doesn't make it Communist. I can call anything I want anything. If it fails to meet the requirements it does not work. This is one of the most basic concepts. C'mon.",
