   "The scope, the extent, the insidious nature of corporate influence in regulatory agencies of government - this question of regulatory capture - is something we should attend to here. It is the lesson. And it raises the question, beyond the Minerals Management Service, how far does this corporate influence reach into our agencies of government?\n \n The wealth of the international corporate world is staggering. The five biggest oil companies just this quarter posted profits of $23 billion dollars. That's a 23 with twelve zeros behind it-in just one quarter.\n \n The Republican appointees on the Supreme Court just overturned decades of precedent and a hundred years of practice to give these big corporations freedom to spend unlimited funds in our American elections.\n\n Senator Sheldon Whitehouse:\n Daily Kos: Sen. Whitehouse EXPLODES! \"America . . must never be on it's knees before Corporate Power\"!!\n \n Corruption and corruption and more corruption, mostly Republican corruption but a number of Democratic cowards gave them all a hand up.",

Now don't you feel stupid for clamouring for a totalitarian state.\n\n \n Exactly, if a corporation had to convince 300 million customers of something then this is expensive and difficult so you better not act stupidly. Now, if you are a corporation and you only have to convince congress of something then this is awesome...one stop shop to get your very own barriers to entry and competitive advantage. Put government back at the local level for most things and you will see less corporations running politics. Simone can't seem to grasp this concept.",
