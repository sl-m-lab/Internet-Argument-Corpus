   "Superman is a Christ figure, the only son of Jor-El sent to earth to save humanity. Christianity has permeated Hollywood since 9/11. I wanted Superman to be fighting the War on Terror. Bin Laden would have made a more formidable enemy than Lex Luthor. George Bush could have had a role. A 3 hundred million dollar price tag demands relevance. Superman Returns is reminiscent of the first film. Brandon Routh looks like, acts and sounds like Christopher Reeve. The refinement is that Superman and Lois Lane have a son. If I were superstitious, I would imagine a curse on the Superman character. The old television Superman committed suicide, and Reeve was paralyzed and died young. \n \n 100 GREATEST MOVIES http://jimcolyer.com/papers/entry?id=28",
