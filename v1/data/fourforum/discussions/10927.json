Do you think I'm unable to read between the lines or comprehend that you look down on me because of my commitment to an invisible God? And how deep is your delusion when in the first paragraph here you deny attributing my ignorance to my religious beliefs and in the third paragraph you explain why you think I'm ignorant because of my religious beliefs. Yet because you never used the word religion in your last post, you deny that is your motivation for thinking of me as you do.\n \n \nNo, I already listed what makes you a simpleton and ignorant.\n\n \n And they all add up to you disagreeing with my world view tq. In your mind, anyone who believes as I do is equivalent to an illiterate redneck who is so simple they haven't the capacity to think critically enough to discount the myths of ancient sheepherders. \n \n To people like you, I just decided one day to submit my human will to a christian church. You can't comprehend that I and millions like me have experienced something supernatural and divine in Christ as we abandoned our personal wills in favor of trusting the Lord with our lives. It is beyond you to understand how difficult it was to proclaim my faith to my father as I denied the religion of my birth. In your small mind, that was some choice I made as if over coffee. \n \n It is evidence of how sanctimonious you are to believe that just because you can't see the reality of what God has done and made available to us, then obviously He must not not exist and therefore all who belief in Him are deluded. You will be shocked to find one day that the delusion is yours who deny Him the honor and glory He is worthy of.\n \n \nPlease, enlighten me:\n How is \"an invisible, undetectable super-being got bored and created everything in 6 days by no known means, in a way that can never be comprehended or duplicated\" common sense? What facts is this based on, other than your interpretation of one single book?\n What makes more sense:\n\n \n The shallowness of this paragraph is mind boggling and reveals just how spiritually blind you are. The key words in your post which show how clueless you are, are undetectable, bored, by any known means, never be comprehended, or duplicated. \n \n God's accomplishments are neither invisible nor undetectable. He didn't create everything out of boredom or by no known means at all. I see the evidence of His glory in every single aspect of the natural world which He created with love. But you only see biological mechanisms. You are blind to the consistent interdependent symbiosis which is inherent within the chain of life as you credit it with coming about randomly through some incredible process of natural selection. The only thing I find ironic is that you see my way of thinking as ignorant when you can't even define or pinpoint the original formula which set the standard upon which all life is based. \n \n Every single link which discusses fossils or evolution theory starts out with it might represent, or may have happened, or could have been this way. The prediction suggests, or based on observations which are 4 degrees removed from the conclusions we are assuming. \n \n \nWe can base conclusions on what we observe and document (you do this every day-that makes it common sense). Creatures that reproduce have offspring which posess variations (your children aren't clones of you, are they?). These variations can affect reproductive viability. Those variations that confer an advantage will be passed on more often than those that don't.\n There you go, I just summed up the basic idea behind evolution. Point out exactly what above is not common sense or \"imaginings\".\n\n \n See what I mean? You evos constantly insist that evo doesn't ask the question of who or what is God, but at the same time you are too ignorant to understand that your pseudo religion is attempting to explain how we got here by erasing Him from the equation. So it's true that you're not making any claims about God either way. You're just completely ignoring the question altogether.

As you can see the writers grammar is perfect and in depth as it describes his question.\n If humans were said to be.. or be related to gorillas.. or chimpanzees or of those african apes, why is there still such things as gorillas and other apes.. wouldnt there be all humans if the apes have evolved into these humans.. how are these apes still maintain all the perfect DNA as to what exactly they are as apes, when apes have evolved into humans.\n Now here is an exact quote of your thread title and its premise which accomplished nothing more than expressions of concern here from people who usually agree with you on issues. In other words, other secular humanists. Here's what you said:\n \n If god made human from dirt, how come there are still dirt around? - obvious_child\n \n Now since you evidently still can't see the error of your ways, let me rewrite your posed question as it should have been written by a literate adult.\n \n If God made humans from dirt, how come there is still dirt around? Sound a little better child? Even though the premise is absolutely ludicrous since God only created Adam out of the Earth. So nice try trying to compare a question about how if man evolved from Apes, why are apes still around, to your infantile premise in the illiterate question you posed about God in the religion forum, but you fail at every turn to squirm out of the blatant ignorance it reveals.\n \n \nI wasn't aware that 2000-5000=14,000 or that math was a lie and pseudo science.\n\n \n Gee, I wasn't either little child.

In fact, it makes little sense to talk about \"the bronze age\" without reference to location and culture - different civilisations experienced these at different times. The bronze age in Britain, for example, is reckoned to start around 2100BC.",

   "So let me get this straight. You went over and scoured the search feature at EVC Forums just to find some phraseology similar enough to try to pass of as if you were just plagiarizing some one else and not as ignorant as you really are? Is that your story? OK, here is the question from EVC, as it was written. As you can see the writers grammar is perfect and in depth as it describes his question.\n\n \n Seriously, your inability to use search engines is rather disturbing. I merely put the phrase into the \"exact\" function of Google and that's what I got. It took me about 5 seconds to do that work. \n \n \nIf god made human from dirt, how come there are still dirt around? - obvious_child\n\n \n Care to look at message 10 on that thread? \n \n You haven't refuted ####. I did not make up that mockery statement. You claimed I did and then attacked m on the poor grammar. The problem is, beyond your inability to do math, is that I did not make up that quote. \n \n I realize you have a serious problem of doing math, but try do this for me, which is a later date, 12-24-2007 or 01-31-2008 when I first made that comment?\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution/10881-if-god-made-human-dirt-how-come-there-still-dirt-around.html#post299631\n \n Please, which year is more recent 2008 or 2007? Or do I need to get you a calender since you can't do the most simplest of math? \n \n \nNow since you evidently still can't see the error of your ways, let me rewrite your posed question as it should have been written by a literate adult.\n\n \n Still on the the whole \"you're an ##### because your quote is grammatically wrong eh?\"\n \n Too bad I didn't make up the quote. Furthermore, the bad grammar serves another purpose, one you still haven't figured out. \n \n \nGee, I wasn't either little child. Care to post where I subtracted 2000 from 5000 and came up with 14,000 in context of the debate you claim it was made in? Or where I said that math was a lie and a pseudo science? Because you are again misquoting me if you're alleging I argued that.\n\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/326377-post21.html\n \n Failing as usual. \n \n I'm still waiting for your truly asinine argument as to how Co2 not, O2 is the gas necessary for a wide variety of organic reactions, specifically respiration.",

   "\n \n Now, how about those answers Archie?\n\n \n Never going to happen. Arch is supremely lazy. He didn't even bother to read the link I gave him to actually find the quote while accusing me of looking for something very similar. Too bad what he quoted doesn't even discuss dirt. How lazy do you have to be to refuse to read more then 10 posts of a thread?",
