Handgun Ban (Update2) \n \n By Cary O'Reilly\n \n March 9 (Bloomberg) -- A U.S. appeals court struck down a three-decade-old District of Columbia law that bans residents from keeping a handgun in their homes, saying the Constitution's Second Amendment protects an individual right to bear arms. \n \n The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in Washington also threw out a district law requiring registered firearms to be kept disassembled or under trigger lock. \n \n It's the first time a federal appeals court has struck down a gun-control measure on Second Amendment grounds. Nelson Lund, a constitutional law professor at George Mason University in neighboring Virginia, said an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court is ``very likely.'' \n\n \n Full text of the decision available at:\n \n http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/docs/common/opinions/200703/04-7041a.pdf\n \n Any thoughts on where this is likely to go? I can certainly see how it could be pushed to the supreme court, but it seems like there would be enormous political pressure NOT to do so given the current makeup of the supreme court and the damage that an individual rights finding could have on gun control nationwide. \n \n It seems likely that even if this is not appealed, this will virtually have to end up in the supreme court at some point since the precedent set here is so at odds with what has been set in other parts of the nation.",

The antigun movement would stand to lose alot more ground than the progun side. \n\n \n As I read the decision, not only would the GCA be unconstitutional, but the NFA as well...machine guns for everybody....without the stupid tax (since you can not tax a right). The decision goes into some depth regarding the types of weapons that are acceptable, including stating several times that even if the militia clause is considered equal in weight to the operative clause, then still weapons that are commonly in use by the armed forces would be acceptable. You would have a hard time arguing, if that is the criteria, that machine guns are not in common military use. And if you have an individual right to own a machine gun, then taxing such ownership would be illegal. \n \n Ultimatly I think that under the circumstances set forth in the ruling, where the RKBA is recognized as an individual right and is accorded the same protections as our other rights, and is dealt with the same as our other rights, that registration becomes a moot point. Most of the opposition that I have seen regarding registration seems to be related to a fear that guns may someday be made illegal, and the registration list would become a confiscation list. If recognized as an individual right, those fears would largely vanish. \n \n I don't think it is really anything to concern ourselves with. Currently the RKBA is NOT recognized as an individual right, and people are not willing to allow registration or competency testing. It is extremely difficult to imagine that it would be recognized as an individual right and then all those who have in the past oppose registration and copetency testing would suddenly go \"Ok, now lets register and test\". \n \n \nTrue...

We spent a good deal of today discussing the ruling. He says that the attitude with many of the prominent anti gunners is along the lines of \"it is all over\". They know that there is no way that a collective rights interpetation can hold up to any kind of scrutiny and they doubt that our current supreme court has the kind of moral flexibility to toss out a BS ruling for the sake of political expediency. If you look at some of the sitting justices past comments on the second ammendment, it seems pretty doubtful that a majority of them are likely to put a stamp on a collective rights interpetation.\n \n Then again, there have been a lot of decision by the supreme court that seem to be complete and utter BS aimed exclusively at keeping the federal and state governments strong...usually at the expense of the people, so nothing they could do at this point would shock me.",

   "Sorry I missed this until now. I just discovered it by checking what's new here. I have rapidly read through the majority opinion, and I have skimmed the dissent. Both appear very well written. \n \n This appears to be a significant new development, and will likely end up before SCOTUS.\n \n I'll have to read it in-depth before I can offer too much, but here are my initial thoughts.\n \n 1. Standing, as always, is a critical issue. It looks like 6 +/- pages (all of Part II) of the majority opinion are devoted to the topic. If SCOTUS were to dodge the case on appeal, it could declare the petitioners have not presented and Article III case or controversy, and as such have no standing and end it there (which is what SCOTUS would have done in U.S. v. Miller if it wanted to declare for the then-non-existent collective right theory)\n \n 2. The case should end up before SCOTUS. For years now we have had a split of opinion amongst the circuit courts of appeals on the nature/scope of the 2nd. Amendment. When things like this happen SCOTUS likes to step in and resolve the differences in opinion for the sake of uniformity. It did not do so with Emmerson, but that case was very different from this new one. First and foremost, Emmerson assumed the individual RKBA view and still did not declare the federal statute in question to be an unconstitutional infringement of the 2nd. Amendment. SCOTUS was therefore able to sidestep the case. In this new case, however, the nature and scope of the 2nd. Amendment is the issue. Because this case invalidates a federal statute on 2nd. amendment grounds SCOTUS must on appeal tell us what the amendment really means (unless it rules that the petitioners lack standing). Additionally, the justice department is obligated to defend federal statutes when challenged, and it will in my opinion be forced to appeal this decision to SCOTUS. Finally, this case comes from the most powerful and influential circuit court of appeal, and may attract a SCOTUS opinion for that reason alone. SCOTUS could refuse to grant a Writ and hear the appeal, but I think it unlikely. This just might be the case that confronts them with the issue.\n \n 3. The majority argues something which I have argued many times before (it's not my original thought, though, I just researched and accepted what leading IR scholars have been saying). That thought is this: The 2nd. amendment recognizes a prime civic virtue of preferring a militia over a standing army-BUT-the right is broader than the civic virtue and recognizes the fundamental right of self-defense.\n \n 4. The dissent appears to be a well-written argument for the collective and/or hybrid individual/collective right view of the 2nd. amendment, and is worth reading. I certainly intend to fully do so even though I don't think I'll find it persuasive. \n \n 5. The majority examines the primary preceding cases, like Robertson, Dread Scott, Miller, etc. I need to read more about how it deals with these cases before I can comment further.\n \n 6. The majority says the nature of the right is individual, but the scope of the right will not be absolute. This is a common theme for all of our rights. No right is absolute, and all can be subject to rational limitation (this addressed the anti-gun \"if it's an IR then it must also allow bubba to own a nuke\" argument) Here are some of the regulations/restriction the majority hints (because this is dicta and not part of the holding) could be placed on an individual RKBA:\n \n \"That is not to suggest that the government is absolutely barred from regulating the use and ownership of pistols. The protections of the Second Amendment are subject to the same sort of reasonable restrictions that have been recognized as limiting, for instance, the First Amendment. See Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 791 (1989) (\"[G]overnment may\n impose reasonable restrictions on the time, place, or manner of protected speech . . . .\"). Indeed, the right to keep and bear arms-which we have explained pre-existed, and therefore was preserved by, the Second Amendment-was subject to restrictions at common law. We take these to be the sort of reasonable regulations contemplated by the drafters of the Second Amendment. For instance, it is presumably reasonable \"to prohibit the carrying of weapons when under the influence of intoxicating drink, or to a church, polling place, or public assembly, or in a manner calculated to inspire terror . . . .\" State v. Kerner, 107 S.E. 222, 225 (N.C. 1921). And as we have noted, the United States Supreme Court has observed that prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons does not offend the Second Amendment. Robertson, 165 U.S. at 281-82. Similarly, the Court also appears to have held that convicted felons may be deprived of their right to keep and bear arms. See Lewis v. United States, 445 U.S. 55, 65 n.8 (1980) (citing Miller,\n 307 U.S. at 178). These regulations promote the government's interest in public safety consistent with our common law tradition. Just as importantly, however, they do not impair the core conduct upon which the right was premised. \n \n Reasonable restrictions also might be thought consistent with a \"well regulated Militia.\" The registration of firearms gives the government information as to how many people would be armed for militia service if called up. Reasonable firearm proficiency testing would both promote public safety and produce better candidates for military service. Personal characteristics, such as insanity or felonious conduct, that make gun ownership dangerous to society also make someone unsuitable for service in the militia. Cf. D.C. Code \u00a7 49-401 (excluding \"idiots, lunatics, common drunkards, vagabonds, paupers, and persons convicted of any infamous crime\" from militia duty). On the other hand, it does not follow that a person who is unsuitable for militia service has no right to keep and bear arms. A physically disabled person, for instance, might not be able to participate in even the most rudimentary organized militia. But this person would still have the right to keep and bear arms, just as men over the age of forty-five and women would have that right, even though our nation has traditionally excluded them from membership in the militia. As we have Of course, the District's virtual ban on handgun ownership is not based on any militia purpose. It is justified solely as a measure to protect public safety. As amici point out, and as D.C. judges are well aware, the black market for handguns in the District is so strong that\n handguns are readily available (probably at little premium) to criminals. It is asserted, therefore, that the D.C. gun control laws irrationally prevent only law abiding citizens from owning handguns. It is unnecessary to consider that point, for we think the D.C. laws impermissibly deny Second Amendment rights. 18The relevant text of the provision reads as follows: (a) A registration certificate shall not be issued for a: . . . (4) Pistol not validly registered to the current registrant in the District prior to September 24, 1976, except that the provisions of this section shall not apply to any organization that employs at least 1 commissioned special police officer or other employee licensed to carry a firearm and that arms the employee with a firearm during the employee's duty hours or to a police officer who has retired from the Metropolitan Police Department. D.C. Code \u00a7 7-2502.02. Although not relevant here, there is also an exception to the registration restriction for retired police officers of the Metropolitan Police Department. See D.C. Code \u00a7 7-2502.02(b) . explained, the right is broader than its civic purpose. See Volokh, supra, at 801-07.\"\n \n There is no denying this decision is a major development which appears likely to force SCOTUS to rule on the individual/collective debate. I just found out about this case tonight, and I'm still going through it. I'm sure there will be other nuggets to glean from it.",

   "OK. I think I've got the case down now (at least the majority opinion). \n \n This is a 2-1 opinion by a three judge panel. DC has announced it will seek a review by the full court of appeals. Regardless of what the full panel does, either side may appeal to SCOTUS.\n \n Here is how I see the majority opinion. The majority accepts and adopts the reasoning of prominent individual right scholars. I am not one of those scholars. I have argued nearly all of the following themes here before, but that's because people smarter than me have turned me onto these arguments and I have agreed with them. \n \n Here is how I would break down the themes expressed in the opinion:\n \n 1. The right pre-existed the constitution.\n 2. The purpose of the right is broader than the preamble's stated militia benefit, and includes the natural right of self defense.\n 3. The right was placed within a body of individual liberties because it was also an individual right\n 4. \"The people\" means just that-the people as individuals and not as some subset of militia members.\n 5. \"Bear arms\" is broader than a military context, and included bearing private arms for private purposes.\n 6. \"keep\" likewise means individuals keeping their privately owned arms, and is likewise far broader than a military only definition. \n 7. \"Well regulated militia\" means the people, not just those involved in temporary active militia service.\n 8. The militia clause is a preamble which does not limit the substantive right to mere militia participation.\n 9. U.S. v. Miller is implicitly an individual right view opinion.\n 10. \"Security of a free state\" does not limit the right to those who live in states (thus exempting the residents of DC from the right's protection), but merely means ensuring a free and republican form of government\n 11. Handguns would qualify as protected arms under the 2nd. Amendment \n 12. The individual right is not unlimited (no, bubba can't have his nuke) and can be rationally limited.\n \n I don't know how any of the quotes will format because it's tough to predict how jumbled things get when you cut and past from .pdf files.\n \n THE RIGHT PRE-EXISTED THE CONSTITUTION\n \n The majority opinion notes that the Bill of Rights did not create any rights, but recognized rights which pre-existed the founding of the national government (correctly citing Robertson v. Baldwin, 165 U.S. 275, 280 (1897) for this position).\n \n ITS PURPOSE IS BROADER THAN THE MILITIA BENEFIT\n \n It says the proper scope of an individual RKBA in the 2nd. Amendment goes beyond a mere militia function, and should be determined by looking into the scope of the right at the time:\n \n \"To determine what interests this pre-existing right protected, we look to the lawful, private purposes for which people of the time owned and used arms. The correspondence and political dialogue of the founding era indicate that arms were kept for lawful use in self-defense and hunting. The pre-existing right to keep and bear arms was premised on the commonplace assumption that individuals would use them for these private purposes, in addition to whatever militia service they would be obligated to perform for the state. The premise that private arms would be used for self-defense accords with Blackstone's observation, which had influenced thinking in the American colonies, that the people's right to arms was auxiliary to the natural right of self-preservation.\"\n \n PLACEMENT OF THE RIGHT\n \n The opinion also addresses the placement of the RKBA within a body of other individual liberties:\n \n \"Every other provision of the Bill of Rights, excepting the Tenth, which speaks explicitly about the allocation of governmental power, protects rights enjoyed by citizens in their individual capacity. The Second Amendment would be an inexplicable aberration if it were not read to protect individual rights as well.\"\n \n THE PEOPLE\n \n The opinion notes the term \"the people\" is found in the First, Second, Fourth, Ninth, and Tenth Amendments. It says that every time this phrase is used it was \"designed to protect the interests of individuals against government intrusion, interference, or usurpation.\" It correctly cites Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. 259 (1990) for this position. The opinion says the founders were capable of distinguishing between \"the people,\" on the one hand, and \"the states,\" on the other hand: \n \n \"[I]t seems passing strange that the able lawyers and statesmen in the First Congress (including James Madison) would have expressed a sole concern for state militias with the language of the Second Amendment. Surely there was a more direct locution, such as \"Congress shall make no law disarming the state militias\" or \"States have a right to a well-regulated militia.\"\"\n \n BEAR ARMS\n \n The opinion addresses a gun control interpretation argument, namely, that the word \"bear\" in \"bear arms\" must be limited to a military definition and thus only protect the right of members of militias to bear their militia arms during service. The opinion rejected this narrow reading of the word:\n \n \"[T]here are too many instances of \"bear arms\" indicating private use to conclude that the drafters intended only a military sense. We also note that at least three current members (and one former member) of the Supreme Court have read \"bear Arms\" in the Second Amendment to have meaning beyond mere soldiering: \"Surely a most familiar meaning [of 'carries a firearm'] is, as the Constitution's Second Amendment ('keep and bear Arms') and Black's Law Dictionary . . . indicate: 'wear, bear, or carry . . . upon the person or in the clothing or in a pocket, for the purpose . . . of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive action in a case of conflict with another person.\" Muscarello v. United States, 524 U.S. 125, 143 (1998) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting, joined by Rehnquist, C.J., Scalia, J., and Souter, J.) (emphasis in original). Based on the foregoing, we think the operative clause includes a private meaning for \"bear Arms.\"\n \n KEEP ARMS\n \n The opinion also dealt with a gun control argument which attempted to define the word \"keep\" in military-only terms:\n \n \"District has attempted to equate \"keep\" with \"keep up,\" a term that had been used in phrases such as \"keep up a standing army\" or, as in the Articles of Confederation, \"every state shall keep up a well regulated and disciplined militia . . . .\" See Wills, supra, at 66. The argument that \"keep\" as used in \"the right of the people to keep . . . Arms\" shares a military meaning with \"keep up\" as used in \"every state shall keep up a well regulated militia\" mocks usage, syntax, and common sense. Such outlandish views are likely advanced because the plain meaning of \"keep\" strikes a mortal blow to the collective right theory. Turning again to Dr. Johnson's Dictionary, we see that the first three definitions of \"keep\" are \"to retain; not to lose,\" \"to have in custody,\" \"to preserve; not to let go.\" Johnson, supra, at 540. We think \"keep\" is a straightforward term that implies ownership or possession of a functioning weapon by an individual for private use. Emerson, 270 F.3d at 231 & n.31; accord Silveira, 328 F.3d at 573-74 (Kleinfeld, J.). The term \"bear arms,\" when viewed in isolation, might be thought ambiguous; it could have a military cast. But since \"the people\" and \"keep\" have obvious individual and private meanings, we think those words resolve any supposed ambiguity in the term \"bear arms.\"\n \n WELL REGULATED MILITIA\n \n The opinion also deals with the attempt to narrowly define the militia into only those in active militia service. It notes that the history of the militia when the amendment was adopted included all citizens capable of bearing arms, and it cites both U.S. v. Miller and the 1792 militia act for defining the \"militia\" as the people from who kept and bore private arms and for the statement that these men appear bearing arms supplied by themselves when called out. It also addressed the current militia statute. Here is some of the relevant portion of the militia discussion:\n \n \"The District claims that Miller's historical account of the \"Militia\" supports its position. Yet according to Miller, the militia included \"all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defence\" who were \"enrolled for military discipline.\" And Miller's expansive definition of the militia-qualitatively different from the District's concept-is in accord with the second Militia Act of 1792, passed by the Second Congress The District's definition of the militia is just too narrow. The militia was a large segment of the population-not quite synonymous with \"the people,\" as appellants contend-but certainly not the organized \"divisions, brigades, regiments, battalions, and companies\" mentioned in the second Militia Act. Id. at 272.\n \n The District argues that the modifier \"well regulated\" means that \"[t]he militia was not individuals acting on their own; one cannot be a one-person militia.\" We quite agree that the militia was a collective body designed to act in concert. But we disagree with the District that the use of \"well regulated\" in the constitutional text somehow turns the popular militia embodied in the 1792 Act into a \"select\" militia that consisted of semi-professional soldiers like our current National Guard. Contemporaneous legislation once again provides us with guidance in reading ambiguous constitutional text. See Op. at\n 30; see also Silveira, 328 F.3d at 579-80 (Kleinfeld, J.).\n \n The statute thus makes clear that these requirements were independent of each other, i.e., militiamen were obligated to arm themselves regardless of the organization provided by the states, and the states were obligated to organize the militia, regardless of whether individuals had armed themselves in accordance with the statute. We take these dual requirements-that citizens were properly supplied with arms and subject to organization by the states (as distinct from actually organized)-to be a clear indication of what the authors of the Second Amendment contemplated as a \"well regulated Militia.\"\n \n As the foregoing makes clear, the \"well regulated Militia\" was not an elite or select body. See Silveira, 328 F.3d at 577-78 (Kleinfeld, J.). While some of the founding fathers, including George Washington and Alexander Hamilton, favored such organizations over a popular militia, see THE ORIGIN OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT at xlvii (David E. Young ed., 2d ed. 1995), the Second Congress unambiguously required popular participation. The important point, of course, is that the popular nature of the militia is consistent with an individual right to keep and bear arms: Preserving an individual right was the best way to ensure that the militia could serve when called.\n \n THE MILITIA CLAUSE-PREAMBLE OR LIMITING STATEMENT?\n \n The opinion addresses the argument that the militia clause acts to handcuff the right clause and limit the right to militia membership. It says the militia clause is essentially a preamble that states a salutary goal, and that this goal does not restrict the right-finding justification for this from comparison to preambles in state constitutions. The opinion cites Professor Eugene Volokh, who has done a lot of research into this area. Here are some relevant portions of the opinion's \"preamble\" view\" \n \n \"The District points to the singular nature of the Second Amendment's preamble as an indication that the operative clause must be restricted or conditioned in some way by the prefatory language. However, the structure of the Second Amendment turns out to be not so unusual when we examine state constitutional provisions guaranteeing rights or restricting governmental power. It was quite common for prefatory language to state a principle of good government that was narrower than the operative language used to achieve it. Volokh, supra, at 801-07.\n \n We think the Second Amendment was similarly structured. The prefatory language announcing the desirability of a well regulated militia-even bearing in mind the breadth of the concept of a militia-is narrower than the guarantee of an individual right to keep and bear arms. The Amendment does not protect \"the right of militiamen to keep and bear arms,\" but rather \"the right of the people.\" The operative clause, properly read, protects the ownership and use of weaponry beyond that needed to preserve the state militias. Again, we point out that if the competent drafters of the Second Amendment had meant the right to be limited to the protection of state militias, it is hard to imagine that they would have chosen the language they did. We therefore take it as an expression of the drafters' view that the people possessed a natural right to keep and bear arms, and that the preservation of the militia was the right's most salient political benefit-and thus the most appropriate to express in a political document. That the Amendment's civic purpose was placed in a preamble makes perfect sense given the then-recent ratification controversy, wherein Antifederalist opponents of the 1787 Constitution agitated for greater assurance that the militia system would remain robust so that standing armies, which were thought by many at the time to be the bane of liberty, would not be necessary.\n \n The Federalists who dominated the First Congress offered the Second Amendment's preamble to palliate Antifederalist concerns about the continued existence of the popular militia. But neither the Federalists nor the Antifederalists thought the federal government had the power to disarm the people. This is evident from the ratification debates, where the Federalists relied on the existence of an armed populace to deflect Antifederalist criticism that a strong federal government would lead to oppression and tyranny. Antifederalists acknowledged the argument, but insisted that an armed populace was not enough, and that the existence of a popular militia should also be guaranteed.\"\n \n U.S. V. MILLER\n \n The opinion evaluated Miller and determined it to be an individual right opinion. One key it notes was that Miller was not a member of any militia. It notes the government argued in Miller for a collective right interpretation, and the Court refused use that interpretation to decide the case. Instead, it decided that an individual citizen bearing private arms could make a 2nd. Amendment infringement claim. The opinion also engages in an interesting evaluation of how Miller viewed the scope of weapons protected by the 2nd. Amendment, and in that context gave some indication of how it would define the scope of protected \"arms.\" Here are the relevant portions of this discussion:\n \n \"We agree with the Emerson court (and the dissenting judges in the Ninth Circuit) that Miller does not lend support to the collective right model. See Silveira, 328 F.3d at 586-87 (Kleinfeld, J.); Emerson, 270 F.3d at 226-27. Nor does it support the District's quasi-collective position. Although Miller did not explicitly accept the individual right position, the decision implicitly assumes that interpretation. On the question whether the Second Amendment protects an individual or collective right, the Court's opinion in Miller is\n most notable for what it omits. The government's first argument in its Miller brief was that \"the right secured by [the Second Amendment] to the people to keep and bear arms is not one which may be utilized for private purposes but only one which exists where the arms are borne in the militia or some other military organization provided for by law and intended for the protection of the state.\" Appellant's Br. at 15, 307 U.S. 704 (No. 696). This is a version of the collective right model. Like the Fifth Circuit, we think it is significant that the Court did not decide the case on this, the government's primary argument. Emerson, 270 F.3d at 222. Rather, the Court followed the logic of the government's secondary position, which was that a shortbarreled shotgun was not within the scope of the term \"Arms\" in the Second Amendment. The government had argued that even those courts that had adopted an individual right theory of the Second Amendment14 had held that the term \"Arms,\" as used in both the Federal and various state constitutions, referred \"only to those weapons which are ordinarily used for military or public defense purposes and does not relate to those weapons which are commonly used by criminals.\" Appellant's Br. at 18, 307 U.S. 704 (No. 696). The government then proceeded to quote at length from a Tennessee state court case interpreting \"Arms\" in the Tennessee Bill of Rights to mean weapons \"such as are usually employed in civilized warfare, and that constitute the ordinary military equipment.\" Id. (quoting Aymette v. State, 20 Tenn. (1 Hum.) 154, 157 (1840)). The government's weapons-based argument provided the Miller Court with an alternative means to uphold the National Firearms Act even if the Court disagreed with the government's collective right argument. The Miller Court's holding is based on the government's alternative position:\n \n In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a \"shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length\" at this time has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument. Certainly it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense. Aymette v. State, 2 Humphreys (Tenn.) 154, 158. Miller, 307 U.S. at 178 (emphasis added). \n \n The quotation makes apparent that the Court was focused only on what arms are protected by the Second Amendment, see Emerson, 270 F.3d at 224, and not the collective or individual nature of the right. If the Miller Court intended to endorse the government's first argument, i.e., the collective right view, it would have undoubtedly pointed out that the two defendants were not affiliated with a state militia or other local military organization. Id.\n \n \"With obvious purpose to assure the continuation and render possible the effectiveness of such forces [i.e., the militia] the declaration and guarantee of the Second Amendment were made. It must be interpreted and applied with that end in view.\" 307 U.S. at 178. \n \n We take the \"declaration and guarantee\" referred to by the Miller Court to mean the Second Amendment's prefatory clause (which declares the necessity of a \"well regulated Militia\") and its operative clause (which guarantees the preservation of a right) respectively. The District would have us read this passage as recognizing a limitation on the Second Amendment right based on the individual's connection (or lack thereof) to an organized functioning militia. We disagree. As already discussed, the Miller court was examining the relationship between the weapon in question-a short-barreled shotgun-and the preservation of the militia system, which was the Amendment's politically relevant purpose. The term \"Arms\" was quite indefinite, but it would have been peculiar, to say the least, if it were designed to ensure that people had an individual right to keep weapons capable of mass destruction-e.g., cannons. Thus the Miller Court limited the term \"Arms\"-interpreting it in a manner consistent with the Amendment's underlying civic purpose. \n \n Only \"Arms\" whose \"use or possession . . . has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia,\" id. at 177, would qualify for protection. Essential, then, to understanding what weapons qualify as Second Amendment \"Arms\" is an awareness of how the founding-era militia functioned. The Court explained its understanding of what the Framers had in mind when they spoke of the militia in terms we have discussed above. The members of the militia were to be \"civilians primarily, soldiers on occasion.\" Id. at 179. When called up by either the state or the federal government, \"these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time.\" Id. (emphasis added).\n Miller's definition of the \"Militia,\" then, offers further support for the individual right interpretation of the Second Amendment. Attempting to draw a line between the ownership and use of \"Arms\" for private purposes and the ownership and use of \"Arms\" for militia purposes would have been an extremely silly exercise on the part of the First Congress if indeed the very survival of the militia depended on men who would bring their commonplace, private arms with them to muster. A ban on the use and ownership of weapons for private purposes, if allowed, would undoubtedly have had a deleterious, if not catastrophic, effect on the readiness of the militia for action. We do not see how one could believe that the First Congress, when crafting the Second Amendment, would have engaged in drawing such a foolish and impractical distinction, and we think the Miller Court recognized as much.\n \n SECURITY OF A FREE STATE\n \n The District of Colombia also argued that even if there was an individual RKBA it did not apply in DC because DC was not a state, and the words \"free state\" in the amendment must limit the right to individuals who live in states. The opinion rejects this view and says the words \"free state\" mean essentially a free nation of representative government. Here is a sample of how the court addressed that issue:\n \n \"As a corollary to its collective right position, the District argues-albeit almost as an afterthought-that it is not subject to the restraints of the Second Amendment because it is a purely federal entity.15 Although it has a militia statute, see D.C. Code \u00a7 49-401, the District argues that its militia does not implicate federalism concerns embodied in the Second Amendment-i.e., the District's local legislation does not interfere with the \"security of a free State.\" The District does not argue, nor could it, that even if the Second Amendment confers an individual right, that right is enjoyed only by the residents of states (that would mean that citizens of the United States who lived in territories, such as the Northwest Territory, prior to their acceptance as states, did not enjoy a constitutional right). In any event, the Supreme Court has unambiguously held that the Constitution and Bill of Rights are in effect in the District. the District's argument amounts to an appendage of the collective right position. It is only if one reads the prefatory language as limiting the operative clause to a guarantee about militias that one ever arrives at the question whether the guarantee is confined to state militias. \n \n First, the dissent (and the District) mistakenly reads \"a free State\" to mean an actual political unit of the United States, such as New York, etc., rather than a hypothetical polity. In fact, Madison's initial proposal to the First Congress stated that a well-regulated militia was \"the best security of a free country.\" THE COMPLETE BILL OF RIGHTS, supra, at 169. The House committee then substituted \"State\" for \"country\" when it initially altered Madison's proposal. We have no record of the House committee's proceedings, but it is not credible to conclude that a profound shift was intended in the change from \"country\" to \"State,\" particularly as there was no subsequent comment on the change.\n \n The use of both the indefinite article and the modifier \"free\" with the word \"state,\" moreover, is unique to the Second Amendment. Elsewhere the Constitution refers to \"the states\" or \"each state\" when unambiguously denoting the domestic political entities such as Virginia, etc. With \"a free State,\" we understand the framers to have been referring to republican government generally.\"\n \n THE HANDGUN BAN VIOLATES THE INDIVIDUAL RIGHT\n \n Finally, the majority looks at the last-ditch argument DC uses-even if it is an individual right and it applies in DC, the handgun ban does not violate the right. The opinion gets into another discussion of the word \"arms\" and how Miller dealt with the issue. The opinion says that handguns (and rifles and shotguns) would meet the Miller test. The opinion also addresses the \"frozen in time\" argument some anti-gunners use-if an individual right then it can only be to weapons knows at the time like swords and flintlocks. The opinion scoffed at this analysis and analogized it to 1st and 4th amendment cases where forms of speech and search have evolved beyond what our founders knew and are nevertheless covered within the amendments.\n Here is a sample of this discussion:\n \n \"The third alternative argument the District presents is that, even if the Second Amendment protects an individual right and applies to the District, it does not bar the District's regulation, indeed its virtual prohibition, of handgun ownership.\n \n The District contends that modern handguns are not the sort of weapons covered by the Second Amendment. But the District's claim runs afoul of Miller's discussion of \"Arms.\" The Miller Court concluded that the defendants, who did not appear in the Supreme Court, provided no showing that shortbarreled (or sawed-off) shotguns-banned by federal statute-bore \"some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia.\" Miller, 307 U.S. at 51, 178. However, the Court also observed that militiamen were expected to bring their private arms with them when called up for service. Those weapons would be \"of the kind in common use at the time.\" Id. at 179. There can be no question that most handguns (those in common use) fit that description then and now. See Emerson, 270 F.3d at 227 n.22 (assuming that a Beretta pistol passed the Miller test).\n \n The Act required militiamen to acquire weapons that were in common circulation and that individual men would be able to employ, such as muskets, rifles, pistols, sabres, hangers, etc., but not cumbersome, expensive, or rare equipment such as cannons. We take the outfitting requirements of the second Militia Act to list precisely those weapons that would have satisfied the two prongs of the Miller arms test. They bore a \"reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia,\" because they were the very arms needed for militia service. And by the terms of the Act, they were to be personally owned and \"of the kind in common use at the time.\"\n \n The modern handgun-and for that matter the rifle and long-barreled shotgun-is undoubtedly quite improved over its colonial-era predecessor, but it is, after all, a lineal descendant of that founding-era weapon, and it passes Miller's standards. Pistols certainly bear \"some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia.\" They are also in \"common use\" today, and probably far more so than in 1789. Nevertheless, it has been suggested by some that only colonial-era firearms (e.g., single-shot pistols) are covered by the Second Amendment. But just as the First Amendment free speech clause covers modern communication devices unknown to the founding generation, e.g., radio and television, and the Fourth Amendment protects telephonic conversation from a \"search,\" the Second Amendment protects the possession of the modern-day equivalents of the colonial pistol. See, e.g., Kyllo v. United States, 533 U.S. 27, 31-41 (2001) (applying Fourth Amendment standards to thermal imaging search).\"\n \n NOT AN UNLIMITED RIGHT\n \n The final issue was a discussion that the right is not unlimited. See my initial response to this case for the types of regulations/restrictions the court hinted could still be imposed on the individual RKBA.",

   "This is what I see as being the logical lapse in the decision:\n \n \nWe think the Second Amendment was similarly structured. The prefatory language announcing the desirability of a well regulated militia-even bearing in mind the breadth of the concept of a militia-is narrower than the guarantee of an individual right to keep and bear arms. The Amendment does not protect \"the right of militiamen to keep and bear arms,\" but rather \"the right of the people.\" The operative clause, properly read, protects the ownership and use of weaponry beyond that needed to preserve the state militias. Again, we point out that if the competent drafters of the Second Amendment had meant the right to be limited to the protection of state militias, it is hard to imagine that they would have chosen the language they did. We therefore take it as an expression of the drafters' view that the people possessed a natural right to keep and bear arms, and that the preservation of the militia was the right's most salient political benefit-and thus the most appropriate to express in a political document. That the Amendment's civic purpose was placed in a preamble makes perfect sense given the then-recent ratification controversy, wherein Antifederalist opponents of the 1787 Constitution agitated for greater assurance that the militia system would remain robust so that standing armies, which were thought by many at the time to be the bane of liberty, would not be necessary.\n\n \n They keep returnign to that same theme...the right recognized is much wider than the militia component. Yet, in the section on potential restrictions, they say:\n \n \nReasonable restrictions also might be thought consistent with a \"well regulated Militia.\" The registration of firearms gives the government information as to how many people would be armed for militia service if called up. Reasonable firearm proficiency testing would both promote public safety and produce better candidates for military service. Personal characteristics, such as insanity or felonious conduct, that make gun ownership dangerous to society also make someone unsuitable for service in the militia. \n\n \n It seems illogical to me that the right is broader than the militia component, but that restrictions on that right that are compatible with the militia component...which is supposedly narrower than the actual right...are acceptable. \n \n I don't disagree with the idea that the right is not unlimited. I would not even disagree that competency testing is a good idea. It just seems that to base restriction on what the ruling claims is essentially the narrower view of the right is the wrong tact to take. \n \n What do you think will end up happening here, Bryan? Or, I should ask, what do you WANT to happen here. It seems like it will be difficult for the supreme court to dodge this one. I am not sure if I really want to see it in the supreme court, though. \n \n I have an associate who is a retired federal judge. He is very pro gun, but he does not want to see this in the supreme court. He argues that nobody has actually BELIEVED the collective rights theory for decades, and it may be that nobody EVER actually believed it. It was just something used to try to explain away a right that the government REALLY does not want you to have. \n \n He explains the Miller decision like this:\n \n It is a good example of the supreme court weaseling thier way out from under a problem they did not want to deal with. They did not want to declare the NFA unconstitutional, even though they could clearly see that it was, but they also could not quite bring themselves to be dishonest enough to simply dismiss it.\n \n That was a time, though, that the collective rights theory was relatively unknown and was generally regarded as the BS that it is. Today, there is an alleged controversey regarding the collective rights theory. I think that it would be a lot easier today for judges to take the ruling that the government would prefer they take, which is that the collective rights theory is correct, even though it is as illogical and nonsensical today as it was when the miller court was considering it. \n \n I think what he is concerned about, and what I am concerned about, if this goes to the supreme court is that we end up with another Dred Scott decision....complete and utter BS based on political expediency. \n \n Your thoughts?",

   "Sorry it's taken me so long to respond. Well here is the problem with this opinion. We have spent a couple of days jumping up and down yelling \"We won! We won!\" But now comes the question: Just what did we win?\n \n I do think this case will end up forcing SCOTUS to address the individual/collective right issue. But the next step is likely a full panel DC. Court of Appeal review.\n \n I see a weakness in this opinion. It does not tell us whether the right is fundamental or not. \n \n The highest protection any right has ever been given by SCOTUS involves three things: 1. It is recognized as an individual right. 2. It is recognized as a fundamental right. 3. It is incorporated by the 5th. and 14th. Amendments against state infringement.\n \n This opinion deserves praise because it gives us recognition of an individual right. It properly ignores the incorporation issue because the case does not involve state action. In my opinion, the individual RKBA is a fundamental right, and should be protected as such by our courts. This opinion, however, is silent about whether the right is fundamental or not, and thus leaves open the question of what test the government must meet to justify an infringement of the right. I believe this is a critical omission. We know the right will not be absolute. It will be \"infringed\" by legislation which regulates or restricts the right. When fundamental rights are involved, the government faces a much stricter standard than it must otherwise meet to justify a law regulating or restricting the right. Here is a good explanation of that distinction: \n \n Our opinions applying the doctrine known as \"substantive due process\" hold that the Due Process Clause prohibits States from infringing fundamental liberty interests, unless the infringement is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest. Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S., at 721. We have held repeatedly, in cases the Court today does not overrule, that only fundamental rights qualify for this so-called \"heightened scrutiny\" protection - that is, rights which are \"'deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition,'\" ibid. See Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 303 (1993) (fundamental liberty interests must be \"so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental\" (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)); United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 751 (1987) (same). See also Michael H. v. Gerald D., 491 U.S. 110, 122 (1989) (\"[W]e have insisted not merely that the interest denominated as a 'liberty' be 'fundamental' . . . but also that it be an interest traditionally protected by our society\"); Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 503 (1977) (plurality opinion); Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399 (1923) (Fourteenth Amendment protects \"those privileges long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men\" (emphasis added)).3 All other liberty interests may be abridged or abrogated pursuant to a validly enacted state law if that law is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.  Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 593 (2003).\n \n I think the RKBA easily meets the standards set forth here for status as a \"fundamental right,\" and consequently I think the majority opinion should have stated so. I think it is important for the pro gun organizations who have taken up the cause in this case, like the Second Amendment Foundation, to argue for fundamental right status. I have not read any briefs submitted by the parties or those doing so by amicus, and so I can't say whether anyone has raised this issue.\n \n As for the suggested restrictions listed in the opinion, they are dicta and have no bearing on the opinion itself. I think they were included to counteract the GC argument \"it can't be individual because it would have to be unlimited and Bubba could buy a nuke.\" The importance of these suggested limitations would be for future legislation. The Court here is dropping hints as to what laws it would accept. Let me just pick two of them that jumped out at me. \n \n Registration is a touchy subject because of its well-known history of being a necessary precursor for confiscation. Still, I cannot argue with a straight face that registration by itself could be considered an infringement on the RKBA. It does nothing by itself to prevent or hinder the free exercise of that right. I think it infringes more upon a general right of privacy. I oppose it because it would not serve in my opinion any legitimate government interest sufficient to overcome my right of privacy. I also oppose it because it would be unenforceable. The penalty attached to registration would involve possession of an unregistered firearm. As such, it could not be enforced against felons or those who possess stolen firearms-requiring registration of their firearms would require them to incriminate themselves and therefore the scheme would be unconstitutional as applied to them. There is also a public policy argument to make: Freedom of religion is just as much a fundamental right, yet I do not have to register with the government every time I go to church. I don't have to register with the government and get a secure password before I can surf the net and exercise my right of free speech here. Likewise, I do not see a compelling government interest which requires me to register the free exercise of my RKBA. \n \n Proficiency testing is another suggested limitation. I'm confident I could pass such testing, but I still see this kind of regulation as being unenforceable. The secondary gun market is too vast and you cannot reasonably expect the receivers of any firearm in a private sale or gift to undergo proficiency training under the auspices of the government. Again, requiring a felon to announce that he needs proficiency training for possession of a firearm he just purchased on the secondary market would be forcing him to incriminate himself, and it would be unconstitutional to force him to do so. There is also a public policy argument to make: It strikes me as not unlike the Jim Crow laws that required blacks to show a high degree of literacy before they were allowed to vote. I do not have to take a test to prove I know the authors of all four Gospels before the government allows me to go to church, and I do not have to prove I can read before it allows me to buy a book. Treating the RKBA this way is just a backdoor way of denying its status as a fundamental right.\n \n The critical issue for me remains this fundamental right status. Assume SCOTUS adopts this majority opinion word for word and recognizes an individual right at long last. There will still remain large opportunities for gun banners to engage in mischief. Requiring any law which infringes upon the right to meet the strict scrutiny test is the best way to limit that mischief.\n \n In the end, this case is a welcome step towards where I think we need to be, but SCOTUS should (I'm not able to predict will) do more and declare the RKBA to be fundamental.",

Their track record for accurate forsight is absolutly dismal.\n \n A \"win\" in the supreme court for the pro gun side would almost certainly be the end of the prohibition against the manufacture of machine guns for civilian use. In regards to machine guns, an individual rights ruling would without uestion be the end of the NFA as well, since the NFA is written as a taxation measure, and you cannot tax a right. \n \n The prohibition against felons owning weapons has never had any connection to the militia argument at all, since there is nothing past or present that would suggest that the fact a person is a convicted felon would have any effect on their potential membership or participation in a militia. The precedent for restricting felons rights has been with us for a long time and is well documented. Felons also cannot vote, cannot hold public office, and cannot practice medicine. None of these prohibitions are tied to militia service, nor is the prohibition against owning a firearm. There is, and never has been, any \"militia\" component to that restriction and the restriction is likely to stay intact for the foreseeable future regardless of an individual rights ruling.\n \n I have no idea what is likely to happen in a full review by the DC court. It is fairly unusual for an en banc review to overturn an appelate finding unless there is a significant structural or logical defect in it, and neither exists in this case. The judges who wrote the majority opinion here were careful to address and deconstruct all the individual rights claims that had been put forth. More important than what is likely to happen in the DC court is what is likely to happen in the supreme court. Regardless of what the en banc review finds, it seems extremely likely this will end up in the supreme court. \n \n Bryan had an interesting post that can be seen here:\n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=2918\n \n That is a recap of what current (no longer current since O'Connor is gone...but I think that we know which way alito is likely to lean) have ruled in regards to the second ammendment. \n \n Personally, I am a little leary of it ending up in the supreme court. I have purchased too much \"justice\" to have any real respect left for our legal system, and seen far too many people who were unquestionably RIGHT fail in court because they could not afford effective representation to actually believe that what comes out of our courts has any connections to justice. My only question is whether the current supreme court is likely to rule based on facts, evidence, and logic, or are they more likely to simply take the politically expedient route?",

   "The VPC is no different from the NRA in its ability to stir up its sympathizers with dire predictions. It is correct when it suggest this case could lay the groundwork to challenge laws like felons in possession. But a challenge is not equal to a win in court. SCOTUS will not grant the RKBA status as a \"super right\" and declare it to be so special that it brushes aside all attempts to regulate it. Felons will still lose many of their civil liberties upon conviction, including the RKBA. Free speech and religion are not denied to felons because the state cannot articulate a compelling need to do so. It can, and it has, demonstrated a compelling need to deny felons the RKBA (and SCOTUS has held the same for the non-enumerated but equally fundamental right to vote). These disabilities can be removed by a subsequent pardon or judicial decision restoring the rights.\n \n This case would not automatically mean the destruction of our current firearm regulatory scheme. It would permit challenges to portions of it. The first question SCOTUS will have to answer is what is the scope of protected arms? Will full auto weapons be included, for example? If they are deemed outside the scope of the protected right, then this case would have no impact on their regulation. If within the scope, then once the regulation is challenged the Federal government would have to prove the compelling state interest (or rational relation, depending on how the right is viewed) which permits the partial infringement of the right. \n \n This case also has no impact on firearm regulation by the states. That would require a separate case challenging state regulation where SCOTUS would be confronted with the issue of incorporating the RKBA through the 14th. against the states.",

   "An update:\n It sounds like there is some doubt about whether D.C. will appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. I think gun control advocates understand the difference between losing the battle and losing the war. \n \n \"As he wades into a high-stakes debate over the Second Amendment, the new mayor of the nation's capital faces the possibility that the city could lose the case and undercut decades of hard-fought gun-control legislation across the country.\n \n \"Gun-control advocates are quietly acknowledging that Fenty (D) is in a difficult spot. Across the country, many of them and their attorneys have been meeting in conference rooms to analyze the potential damage that could be done nationwide if the D.C. law falls apart. Some fear that an adverse Supreme Court ruling could lead to more gun lobby challenges and the collapse of tough gun regulations in New York, Chicago and Detroit. Other potential casualties include federal laws that require background checks for gun buyers or ban the manufacture of machine guns for civilian use.\"\n \n Paul Helmke, president of the president of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, comments,\n \" 'The D.C. law is an easy one to shoot at. Factually, it's a tougher one to get behind and defend. Background checks and assault weapons ban -- you can defend all day long. . . .

   "The 9th Circuit Court said, \"Historical research shows that the use of the term 'bear arms' generally referred to the carrying of arms in military service - not the private use of arms for personal purposes.28\"\n\n \n \n However, the 9th Circuit rejects both the Limited Individual Rights model and the Standard Model, despite the historical record on the meaning of to keep and bear arms and the Miller court's use of those words. Instead the 9th Circuit concluded without basis that the right to keeep and bear arms means merely to maintain a state militia -rather than a right of individuals to keep weapons suitable for militia use and to render military service in person. \n \n From Silveira:\n There are three principal schools of thought that form the basis for the debate. \n \n The first, which we will refer to as the \"traditional individual rights\" model, holds that the Second Amendment guarantees to individual private citizens a fundamental right to possess and use firearms for any purpose at all, subject only to limited government regulation. This view, urged by the NRA and other firearms enthusiasts, as well as by a prolific cadre of fervent supporters in the legal academy, had never been adopted by any court until the recent Fifth Circuit decision in United States v. Emerson, 270 F.3d 203, 227 (5th Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 122 S. Ct. 2362 (2002). \n \n The second view, a variant of the first, we will refer to as the \"limited individual rights\" model. Under that view, individuals maintain a constitutional right to possess firearms insofar as such possession bears a reasonable relationship to militia service.8 \n \n The third, a wholly contrary view, commonly called the \"collective rights\" model, asserts that the Second Amendment right to \"bear arms\" guarantees the right of the people to maintain effective state militias, but does not provide any type of individual right to own or possess weapons. Under this theory of the amendment, the federal and state governments have the full authority to enact prohibitions and restrictions on the use and possession of firearms, subject only to generally applicable constitutional constraints, such as due process, equal protection, and the like. Long the dominant view of the Second Amendment, and widely accepted by the federal courts, the collective rights model has recently come under strong criticism from individual rights advocates. After conducting a full analysis of the amendment, its history, and its purpose, we reaffirm our conclusion in Hickman v. Block, 81 F.3d 98 (9th Cir. 1996), that it is this collective rights model which provides the best interpretation of the Second Amendment. \n (my emphasis in Bold)\n \n \n\n Which seems consistent with the Miller decision which also speaks of people carrying arms for military purposes. I have seen one explanation of the standing issue:\n \n \"Miller and Layton, the defendants in the case, had no connection to the militia and thus were technically without standing to bring a Second Amendment claim.

The Circuit court in Emerson shows that the government in Miller argued two theories of the right to bear arms. The first is close to Cornell's position and the second argument agrees with other courts which had found an individual right, but an individual right that did not extend to ownership of arms that were used by criminals (as in Aymette). \n \n The Miller court based its decisuion to reverse and remand on the government's second argument. \n \n Furthermore the Supreme Court's review of the history of the term \"militia\" pokes a very large hole in Cornell's assertion that the court was allowing leeway for Congress to expand or restrict the defintion of \"militia\" as circumstances changed. The Supreme Court held that amendment was intended to insure the existence of such forces and must be interpreted with that end in mind. The Court described at length \"such forces\" and nowhere even suggested that Congress could simply redefine the historical meaning of \"militia\" to suit its purposes as times change.\n \n \n Imagine the imbecility of the Bill of Rights if Congress could simply pass laws redefining the \"freedom of the Press\" or any other term.",

   "Let me address Professor Chemerinsky's thoughts on Parker as quoted by Galileo:\n \n \"In other words, even if the D.C. Circuit is right in holding that the Second Amendment creates individual rights, that does not answer the question as to the level of scrutiny to be used in evaluating gun control laws. I believe that there is a strong argument that the regulation of guns should be treated the same as other regulation of property under modern constitutional law: The regulation should be allowed so long as it is rationally related to achieving a legitimate government purpose.\n \n \"Under this standard, there is no doubt that the D.C. gun law is constitutional. The city's government was pursuing the legitimate goal of decreasing gun violence, and its means were certainly reasonable.\"\n http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn...031301508.html \n \n This is the additional battle I predicted when I made my \"More thoughts on Parker v. D.C.\" post in this thread. If SCOTUS takes this case, I do not see how it avoids an individual right interpretation. The substantive fight will likely be on how the individual right is viewed and consequently what test applies when restrictions on the right are challenged. The Parker opinion does not tell us which limitation test should be applied to laws which restrict an individual RKBA. Chemerinsky has seized upon this oversight to argue for the test he favors--the near anything goes \"rational relationship test.\" \n \n Now Chemerinsky's article is interesting, and not just because he wholly misapprehends the ruling in Miller. I find it fascinating that he makes no mention of something he knows SCOTUS must do if it decides the RKBA is an individual right: decide whether the right is fundamental or not.\n \n If SCOTUS decides the RKBA is not a fundamental right, then the \"rational relation\" test is used, and when laws which restrict that right are challenged the \"legislation is presumed to be valid and will be sustained if the classification drawn by the statute is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.\" Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 579 (2003).\n \n If SCOTUS decides the RKBA is a fundamental right, then the \"strict scrutiny\" test applies, and laws restricting the right must be declared unconstitutional unless the state proves it is addressing a \"compelling\" state interest, which it cannot address by a \"less restrictive\" law, and this restriction is \"narrowly tailored\" to address the compelling interest. \n \n The distinction between fundamental and non-fundamental is critical, and I find it puzzling that that Chemerinsky blithely fast forwards past this necessary determination and assumes SCOTUS must apply his favored \"rational relation\" test. I would have liked to have heard his opinion on how he would dance around SCOTUS precedent to declare the RKBA to be non-fundamental and in need of his proposed test. \n \n Here is how SCOTUS has consistently defined \"fundamental\" rights deserving the protection of \"strict scrutiny\":\n \n Our opinions applying the doctrine known as \"substantive due process\" hold that the Due Process Clause prohibits States from infringing fundamental liberty interests, unless the infringement is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest. Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S., at 721. We have held repeatedly, in cases the Court today does not overrule, that only fundamental rights qualify for this so-called \"heightened scrutiny\" protection - that is, rights which are \"'deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition,'\" ibid. See Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 303 (1993) (fundamental liberty interests must be \"so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental\" (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)); United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 751 (1987) (same). See also Michael H. v. Gerald D., 491 U.S. 110, 122 (1989) (\"[W]e have insisted not merely that the interest denominated as a 'liberty' be 'fundamental' . . . but also that it be an interest traditionally protected by our society\"); Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 503 (1977) (plurality opinion); Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399 (1923) (Fourteenth Amendment protects \"those privileges long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men\" (emphasis added)).3 All other liberty interests may be abridged or abrogated pursuant to a validly enacted state law if that law is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.  Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 593 (2003)\n \n Now, whether you think it should have been or not, who is prepared to argue that the individual ownership of firearms has not been \"deeply rooted in the Nation's history and tradition\"? Who will dispute the claim that (rightly or wrongly) the RKBA is an \"interest traditionally protected by our society\"? Who is prepared to contest the claim that it is a right \"long recognized at common law\"? \n \n Additionally, I find it interesting that Chemerinsky ignores decades of SCOTUS precedent which has consistently opined that that the rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights of the Constitution are \"fundamental\" rights. See Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 668 (1987) After all, is not the RKBA one of the rights so deeply rooted in the Nation's tradition that its exclusion (along with the others in the \"elite 8\" of the BoR) cast serious doubt over the ratification of the Constitution? Was it not so deeply rooted that it was shortly thereafter honored by specific inclusion in the Nation's charter?\n \n These are the questions I believe Chemerinsky avoids in his article. But if SCOTUS takes up this case, and if it unequivocally declares, like Parker, that the 2nd. Amendment recognizes an individual RKBA, then you can bet the house SCOTUS will have to address these questions. I for one believe that SCOTUS should declare the RKBA to be a fundamental individual right and grant it the same protection we afford our other fundamental rights like speech, press, and free exercise of religion. I therefore disagree with Chemerinsky's position.",

Who will dispute the claim that (rightly or wrongly) the RKBA is an \"interest traditionally protected by our society\"? Who is prepared to contest the claim that it is a right \"long recognized at common law\"? \n\n \n It should be immediatly apparent to any thinking person that the RKBA is deeply rooted in the nations history and tradition. Unfortunatly, we are not talking thinking people here, we are talking judges. There is a long history of questionable, or even borderline insane, rulings by judges in this country that meet a policy goal, but can not even pass the \"laugh test\" when it comes to the logical side of things. Look at the \"collective rights\" theory as a whole. It is ilogical and laughable. It is still something we have seen multiple courts agree with.\n \n I can envision a scenario where this goes to the supreme court and DC argues that the tens of thousands of restrictions that we have on the RKBA currently signal an abandonment of the traditional RKBA. I don't think that it would be difficult to argue that in a nation where several areas have outright bans or functionally prohibitive restrictions on the posession of a firearm, the RKBA has passed out of common law. \n \n I saw an individual argue along similar lines not long ago regarding automatic weapons. I argue that automatic weapons are absolutly protected by the second ammendment and that the NFA is unconstitutional. Traditionally the \"arms\" referred to in the RKBA were military type weapons. Even the miller court alluded to this in their finding that the weapon in question was not protected because they were unfamiliar with any military use for such a weapon. \n \n My opponent made a fairly good argument that since the NFA has been on the books for 70 years without much by way of public outcry and without being ruled unconstitutional by the courts we have essentially given up the right of ownership of machineguns as part of the RKBA as that right has passed from common (the common law understanding of a RKBA no longer includes machine guns). I am not explaining it well, but hopefully I have gotten the point across.\n \n Obviously the answer to this would be that the NFA has continually been challenged in the courts and has jsut never quite made it all the way through to the supreme court for a definitive ruling. I refer to his argument as the \"armed uprising\" argument since he is essentially arguing that since we did not rise up and overthrow the government at the passage of the law, that we must all be OK with it.\n \n My fear when it comes to a supreme court ruling is that we will end up with a BS ruling along the lines of \"At one time the RKBA was a fundamental right, but the acceptance of a myriad of restrictions over the last several decades has degraded and therefore the \"rational\" test should apply\"",

   "I often wonder where people truly place their faith in terms of interpretation of things like the 2nd amendment. \n \n It amazed me that plenty of people and some courts hold that the 2nd amendment exists to give the Militia/Army right to bear arms. Which is an insane and redundant interpretation by the way. Why would you need a \"right\" of the military to bear arms in writing. The sole purpose of a standing army is to bear arms and fight. It's been that way for Thousands of years. \n \n Our modern view of the true concept of the 2nd amendment is blurred by 100 years of legal maneuvering attempting to re-write history. If anyone in the world is curious about the true intent of the 2nd amendment I would suggest reading up on quotes made by the people that wrote it! You will find in very clear English that the intent of the 2nd amendment was to preserve the right of the general population to maintain reasonable means of defense. Potential thought of the time for the need for defense would be prevention of invasion from abroad, or raids from the natives. Defense of personal property and self from the criminal element. The last line of Defense against a government gone astray of the constitution. Read some Thomas Jefferson sometime, it'll all become clear. \n \n It all comes down to this: Do you trust a Court with political bias, or do you trust the Founding Fathers and their original intent.\n emoticon_xkill",

   "Yeah Daewoo, I didn't word that very well. When I said \"whether you think it should have been or not\" I was not trying to cast doubt on the long tradition of individual firearm ownership in our country. What I was trying to say was whether or not you agree that our nation's history should have been grounded with a strong tradition of individual firearm ownership this history cannot be denied.\n \n Chemerinsky's hopes aside, I see no honest way for the justices to ignore the historical and legal arguments for the individual right standard model if SCOTUS takes up Parker. But of course I am no more a detached and neutral observer of this issue than he is. \n \n It will be a real test of intellectual honesty for the SCOTUS justices if SCOTUS takes up Parker and uses it to declare the RKBA an individual right. An individual RKBA meets in every respect the current definitions of a \"fundamental\" right. But this Orwellian concept that \"all rights are equal, but some are more equal than others,\" and the classification of the \"more equal\" rights as \"fundamental\" is entirely a 20th century legal creation by SCOTUS justices. It has no root in the founding of the nation, and the definition of \"fundamental\" rights can be changed at judicial whim.\n \n Assume that SCOTUS does use Parker to declare an individual RKBA. The justices will be aware that the \"fundamental\" right question is vitally important not just to that case but also to the issue of subsequent incorporation. This case does not involve state action, and cannot be used as a tool to force the states to guarantee the individual RKBA. SCOTUS would need a later case challenging state restrictions on the right to decide whether \"substantive due process\" (another judicial fiction) requires that the RKBA be incorporated as a right enforceable against state infringement. Now SCOTUS justices have over the years become very fond of the following definition of \"due process\": \n \n \"[T]he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution. This \"liberty\" is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property; the freedom of speech, press, and religion; the right to keep and bear arms; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures; and so on. It is a rational continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints, . . . and which also recognizes, what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must, that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their abridgment.\" Poe v. [Page 849] Ullman, supra, at 543 (opinion dissenting from dismissal on jurisdictional grounds).\"\n \n Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 843-844 (1992) \n \n It is a convenient argument which permits SCOTUS to reach beyond the BoR and create other additional rights which do not exist in the strict wording of the Constitution. Note how the RKBA is included in the definition of \"due process.\" Yet when incorporation is the issue, SCOTUS has traditionally only incorporated those rights deemed \"fundamental.\" It is entirely possible that SCOTUS could take up Parker, declare the right to be individual, but then engage in judicial fiction to declare the right non-fundamental. The effect would be to not only severely wound its ability to check the power of federal infringement. It would also provide the justification for refusing to incorporate the right, leaving the states free to infringe upon it as they please.\n \n ---\n \n \"The issue, however, is not whether court rules are \"mutable\"; they assuredly are. It is not whether, in the light of \"various circumstances,\" they can be \"modifi[ed]\"; they assuredly can. The issue is whether, as mutated and modified, they must make sense. The requirement that they do so is the only thing that prevents this Court from being some sort of nine-headed Caesar, giving thumbs-up or thumbs-down to whatever outcome, case by case, suits or offends its collective fancy.\" Dickerson v. U.S., 530 U.S. 428, 455 (2000) [J. Scalia and Thomas, dissenting opinion]",

   "I read the Parker decision a few months ago. I disagreed most strongly with their analysis of the term \"bear arms\" and of the Miller decision.

Yet the Parker Court decides to go with the more rare meaning of bear arms rather than the common 18th Century meaning. The Parker Court also claimed that the preamble only modifies the meaning of the word \"arms\" in the preamble. The Miller Court, however, made it clear that the both the declaration and guarantee of the Second Amendment must be interpreted with the militia end in view, not just the word arms.

Well, that's a few of my thoughts based on what I remember. \n\n \n You seem to have misread (or misremember) the parker decision in regards to the importance of the term \"bear arms\". The court basically said that since the term was unquestionably sometimes used in an individual capacity, that further research was needed to determine how it was being used in this case. That leads them to start looking at the history of the second amendment, the idea of the militia, and to try to determine what \"bear arms\" was meant to mean. \n \n Ultimatly this is where the collecvtive rights argument falls down. You can make a fairly good argument for collective rights, but not if any history is introduced at all. The \"keep and bear arms\" portion of the second amendment was lifted from the English bill of rights of 1689 which set out the right of subjects to \"bear arms for their own defense\". It the exactl phrase was also used by blackstone and described as the \"natural right of resistance and self-preservation\"\n \n You could theoretically argue that the discussion about what \"bear arms\" means in Parker is dicta, since they ultimatly decide that it does not matter all that much since \"keep\" means to maintain in ones posession. It would be dishonest to make such a claim, but the collective rights folks have been making the same dishonest claim about the finding of the Emerson court for a long time, so it would be nothing new to them. \n \n The Parker decision did take note of the fact that the Miller court required that the militia end be kept in mind when deciding these things, so they endeavored to define \"militia\" and came to the same conclusion that the Miller court did...that the \"militia\" is composed of every American regardless of active service, enrollment in an official body, or, frankly, regardless of what the government might wish to day about the matter.\n \n \nAnd if the Supreme Court does rule in favor of an individual right are we going to see a massive repeal of gun laws? I have a hard time imagining that. As I understand, the Emerson Court ruled in favor of an individual right but still allowed individuals to be disarmed because someone claimed they were a threat and filed a domestic restraining order against them. So they left the doors open for plenty of gun control.\n\n \n That would depend on exactly how the court rules. If they rule that it is a fundemental right, then it is very likely that many (possibly even most) of the gun control laws on the books today are unconstitutional. If, on the other hand, they find that it is not a fundamental right, then most of them would likely remain. As far as I can tell, scholars on both sides of the debate seem to agree that it would be virtually impossible for the court to find that it is an individual right but not a fundamental right. \n \n What the emerson court essentially found was that the second ammendment was an individual right, but they basically applied it as a non fundamental right, which give the government a lot more leaway as far as what they can and can not do. If the supreme court finds it to be a fundamental right, that bar changes significantly. It is questionable whether the logic of emerson would hold up under a fundamental rights analysis.\n \n The nightmare scenario for the anti gunners would actually be if the supreme court found as you indicate you woudl prefer above, that the miller court was correct in their assesment of the \"militia\" portion of the second amendment. If they come back with a ruling like that of the miller court, where they basically rule that military type weapons would be permissible but others might not, there is little or no question that at the very least the '86 ban on the production of machine guns for private ownership would be overturned and likely the NFA (national firearm act...the law that regulates ownership of machine guyns, silencers, and destructive devices) would ultimatly be overturned since it is a tax bill, and the supreme court has ruled on multiple occasions that you cannot tax the exercise of a right.",

   "Well here we go. SCOTUS has granted the writ, and it will decide the case. I see no way for SCOTUS to avoid giving a definitive answer to the individual/collective right question. I still believe that SCOTUS will use this case to declare that the amendment recognizes an individual RKBA. I see no intellectually honest way for SCOTUS to do otherwise. Fort that reason alone I think the \"gun rights\" crowd will end up owing a big \"thank you\" to D.C.'s Mayor for pursuing the appeal to SCOTUS. \n \n People often talk about getting the \"right\" case before SCOTUS, and of both sides being afraid to pursue appeals because of the belief that the facts of the case are not strong enough in one side's favor. I cannot think of a better case for gun rights advocates than Parker, though. The gun rights plaintiff has \"clean hands,\" and the case does not come before SCOTUS because of some wrongdoing on her part. In that sense, this case is far more sympathetic for the individual right view than Emerson was. The challenged law is better for a gun rights appeal as well. The D.C. ban is both far more restrictive and much less justifiable than the protective order possession violation in Emerson. I am convinced that over the next few months you will see organizations like Brady and VPC complain that this is the worst possible test case for their side to defend. \n \n The real question for me will be how SCOTUS defines the individual RKBA-whether it will be viewed as fundamental or not, for example. SCOTUS will not declare the right absolute, and the most important issue after declaring the individual nature of the right will be establishing the standard by which the government can regulate areas it protects. Will it be the difficult to meet \"strict scrutiny\" test, or will the government only have to meet the far less restrictive \"rational relation\" test? I think the answer to this question will end up being the more important issue in the opinion.",

   "Some scholars point out that in context Blackstone was talking about resistance and self-preservation against tyranny. I haven't been able to find any non-military uses of the term bear arms in searches of the Library of Congress website\n\n \n I have absolutely no problem with stipulating that \"bear arms\" refers to their use in an organized militia function or otherwise in combination (collective action). A primary reason that the right was secured was to enable the people to combine and exercise a last ditch effort to rescind their consent to be governed. Surely, if the people are fighting the present organized force of the nation you and your fellow citizens can be said to be bearing arms; \"the right to . . . bear arms\" in the 2nd Amendment secures to the citizen, the original right of working in combination to say THAT'S IT, YOU ARE DONE, NO MORE! \n \n This is a plainly evident truth when one considers the Miller Court's obvious leaning on Aymette. The Tennessee RKBA case was inspected by the Supreme Court because it exactingly considered why the citizen's right to \"keep\" and \"bear\" arms (as two separate entities) was secured (emphasis added):\n [*]\"The object, then, for which the right of keeping, and bearing arms is secured is the of the public. The free white men may keep arms to protect the public liberty, to keep in awe those who are in power, and to maintain the supremacy of the laws and the constitution. The words \"bear arms,\" too, have reference to their military use, and were not employed to mean wearing them about the person as part of the dress. As the object for which the right to keep and bear arms is secured is of general and public nature, to be exercised by the people in a body, for their common defence, so the arms the right to keep which is secured are such as are usually employed in civilized warfare, and that constitute the ordinary military equipment. If the citizens have these arms in their hands, they are prepared in the best possible manner to repel any encroachments upon their rights by those in authority.\"\n From this language, it is easy to see why the Miller Court cited Aymette on the question of how Miller's sawed-off shotgun should be treated. The Court ruled against Miller for just one reason, because no evidence was presented that demonstrated the weapon, as constructed, was, (quoting Miller) \"any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.\" \n \n It is also important to note that the passage from Aymette absolutely and undoubtedly endorses an individual right, rather than a state power.\n \n It recognizes two separate entities. The \"object\" of the provision and the means to achieve it. The object is why the framers thought it important to secure the RKBA, (which is not created by the provision, merely recognized and \"secured\" by it). \n \n There's two aspects of the RKBA; one philosophical and one actionable. The citizen \"keeps\" arms \"to keep in awe those who are in power\" and he bears them when he ACTS to \"repel any encroachments upon their rights by those in authority.\"\n \n Aymette also exposes where the 2nd Amendment perverters have gone off the rails . . . They have taken Aymette's (and Miller's by extension) simple explanation of the collective \"object\" of the amendment and applied that to the individual right the amendment merely recognizes and secures.\n \n \"[T]he people acting in a body, for their common defence, . . . is \"the object for which the [already existing] right to keep and bear arms is secured.\" That defense is of the nation, the state or themselves or their liberties . . . FROM ENCROACHMENTS FROM THE GOVERNMENT.\n \n So, I agree, \"bear arms\" has a military connotation . . . because the 2nd Amendment ain't about duck hunting!",
