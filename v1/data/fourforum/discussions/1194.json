   "Before we discuss the Abortion and the moral dilemma let's look at the core fundamentals of freedom, individual rights through a purely objective and logical perspective. I'm sure until now, you have looked at the issue through altruistic and/or religious eyes. \n \n Now, consider the issue from our point of view. \n \n\n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n Morals are the acts and respect of the right of the individual. \n The right of the individual is the right to life. \n The right to life means that any individual has the right to exercise any type of action/work or thought to maintain his life and happiness. Each individual holds this right. \n \n Anything any person does against the rights of the individual is immoral. Any person \n (s) or group/entity whom violates the individual rights of another is a criminal, and that includes government. \n \n There are only two types of tyrants, the individual who violates the individual rights of another, and the government which deprives and violates the individual rights of any individual. \n \n The individual is his/her own most sacred and valuable entity. \n \n \n\n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n The Declaration of Individual Rights \n by The Illuminati Order \n \n Each individual has natural born rights, which no other person, entity or government of any kind may infringe. The respect and loyalty to these rights is the moral standard of the rational and just human beings. \n The natural rights of the individual are: \n 1. The right to life. \n 2. The right to the pursuit of happiness. \n 3. The right to own property, intellectual and/or tangible. \n 4. The right to perform any action needed to ensure preservation/ending of the life of the self without damaging the environment of the planet. The environment belongs to all and endangering it violates the individual rights of others. \n 5. The right to earn a living through one's own efforts, mental or physical. \n 6. The right to live his/her life any way he/she likes without causing physical harm to another individual. \n 7. The right to defend his/her life and property and family. \n 8. The rights to have children, ONLY if he/she can guarantee food, shelter, clothing, safety and education for such and provide for any and all medical needs of such. \n 9. The right to conduct business with others based on mutual and/or contractual agreement. \n 10. The right to privacy in all forms. \n These are the inalienable human rights inherited at birth. All whom do not respect these rights are parasites. \n \n \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n \n A woman is an individual, and as such, is sovereign over her own body and person, and it is none of your business to tell another person what he/she can or cannot do with his or her body, nor do you or anyone else have any authority to do so, nor will anyone ever have such an authority! \n \n The individual rights are absolutes. \n \n Hogwash. Aborting a fetus is simply aborting a fetus. \n \n One can hardly call it murder when the thing is nothing but a blob of cells. \n \n Murder is to kill a living breathing person. A fetus is not a breathing person, but merely a person in the making. \n \n Furthermore, even if the fetus was breathing, the individual rights are superior and absolute, and a fetus IS the PROPERTY of its owner. \n \n It is up to the mother. It is her body, her life and her sole responsibility. \n \n It is none of your damn business...to dictate to another individual how to live his/her life and what he/she can or cannot do with their body. \n \n I advocate the sovereignty of the individual. What my personal feelings are about last minute abortions is irrelevant. What is relevant is that the woman has sole right and authority over her body and anything which is inside it and attached to it. \n \n If we do not hold the rights of the individual as absolutes, then we have no standard of value and anything goes. \n \n Society starts rotting away at freedoms like a small drop of water on a piece of iron... It all starts with just a little, and then it erodes like a plant being eaten away by a parasite. \n \n Altruism has been tried and tested and it failed miserably. \n Now, it is time we give Objectivism and Objective reality a chance. \n \n Furthermore, christians and religionists have no authority and are in violation of their own bible's teaching when they get involved in issues such as abortion, and especially when it involves none christians, and on this point they are hypocrites. However, let's leave religious discussion out of this thread. \n \n The question should not be \"is it wrong to have an abortion\" but rather is it right to infringe and/or violate the rights of an individual? The answer is NO! \n \n A woman is not property and her body is hers to do with as she pleases. If she wants to kill the fetus inside of her it is her right to do so. neither you or I have ownership-authority over her person.",

We're all blobs of cells. But what type of blobs of cells are we? Obviously, some organisms can be killed while others cannot. We cannot kill innocent human organisms. The question is now \"What is a human\"? \n \n A human first of all has human DNA, a human genetic code. The DNA is the defining part of determining species. Dogs have canine DNA, cats have feline DNA, humans have Homo sapiens DNA. Secondly, a human is alive. It is able to metabolize, reproduce, grow, and stimulate. Finally, humans are independent. It is not an organ; not an arm; it is it's own being. \n \n The fetus has human DNA. The fetus metabolizes, reproduces, grows, and stimulates. Finally, the fetus is independent. It is NOT part of the mother, as if it were the mother would have two arms, two legs, two different genetic codes, and if the fetus were a boy, a pe nis and vag ina (spaces so that the works aren't filtered). Obviously, then, we can easily conclude that the fetus is human. \n \n \nMurder is to kill a living breathing person. A fetus is not a breathing person, but merely a person in the making.\n\n \n Would it then be murder to kill a person who is not breathing? What about those who are unconscious and not breathing?

Brain death is always ultimately caused by some sort of anoxia to the brain, which results in the death of the brain tissue itself, which is non-regenerative. It is the permanent and non-reversible death of the brain that causes what is known as a vegetative state. People in a coma have a chance of reversal of the state they are in (ie. potential to again be a functioning person), and therefore it should be the families (or legal power of attorney) decision to support or withdrawl care to the patient. Someone in a vegatative state however has no chance of regaining significant cognitive function, and should be allowed to die (or be euthanised as needed).

I am not trying to be hyper-critical, but please pay attention to the terminology that you use. Again:\n \n \nVegetative State: This is state of severe mental impairment which is characterized by irreversible cessation of the cognitive or higher cortical functions of the brain and is most often caused by damage to the cerebral cortex. Only involuntary bodily functions are present and there exists no reasonable expectation of regaining significant cognitive function.\n \n \n I see that you are now saying \"vegatative-type state\". This is still misleading, as anything like vegatative is exactly as stated above, irreversible, no reasonalbe expectation of regaining...etc. In other words, vegetative state= permanent. The woman in Texas fell into a coma, a little different, with a chance of recovery. We do not understand how or why people go into a coma, but science now believes that it is partly due to chemical disturbance at the neural junction after sudden injury, temporary negation of the action potential at the neural junction, or both. The point is, this is reversible. And as far as the FL woman, Terri Schiver, it is not a vegatative-type state, it is a vegetative state. And where do you get brink of death from? Terri's mental status has not changed in 13 years. She has remained confined to a long term care facility in Pinellas Park, near Tampa, without change. She has no chance of recovery, this has been attested to by many doctors taking care of Terri, as well as experts across the country. Terri's brain suffered hypoxia, then anoxia due to prolonged oxygen deprivation and resuscitation following a sudden cardiac arrest. When brain cells die due to anoxia, such as in Terri's case, they do not regenerate. Brain cell death is permanent and non-reversible. Most often, if a person is in a non-permanent unconscious state, it is due to swelling in the brain, either due to physical trauma (ie. bruised brain) or metabolic disturbance, such as hypoxia, acidosis, or alkylosis, all leading to increased intracranial pressure. When the swelling goes down or the metabolic disturbance is corrected, function then returns, although there is usually some neural cell death in the process. These are important distinctions to keep in mind if you are going to use such terminology. \n \n \nI don't think it's necessary to kill brain-dead folk, as they already will die. I also don't see a reason to keep them on life support. However, the fetus should be protected because it isn't brain-dead, is it?\n \n \n That being said (you asked for it), suppose a woman is pregnant, and it is dicovered at 4 months that the fetus only contains a brainstem. (this is an actual case I discussed in philosophy class my junior year) The fetus contains the neccesary item to allow it to breathe and sustain heart activity. Once born however, it will never be able to see, hear, speak, or have any qualities which make it human (other than DNA and form). Now, knowing that there is nothing that will make a difference in this case, should the woman be forced to carry the fetus to term (another 5 months), go through labor, and bring this empty shell into existence? Or in this case does it make sense to abort and allow the woman to try again?",

Being bias is his job, just be bias to him then.. its every persons job who does what he does. (I assume that you think he is bias, because that is what every liberal that i have met has said just because they are afraid that he will prove them wrong.) As all of my relatives have admitted to when they switched to conservative.",
