   "Now the most interesting part of this article is not that a civil war is about to start(it already has started.A Sunni insurgency against a Shia army?)but the control the insurgency has around Baghdad and the possibilty of Shia militias policing Sunni areas.Its widely known,but usually unreported fact in the Western media,that many of the roads coming into Baghdad are unpassable for the US and Iraqi army and that the insurgency seems to have quite a presence in Baghdad considering the continous car bombings there,a capital remember that hosts a large Shia population.The use of Shia militias is a desperate and dangerous ploy that gives more power to al-Sistani and will add fuel to the civil war.\n \n \nWith security experts reporting that no major road in the country was safe to travel, some Iraq specialists speculated that the Sunni insurgency was effectively encircling the capital and trying to cut it off from the north, south and west, where there are entrenched Sunni communities. East of Baghdad is a mostly unpopulated desert bordering on Iran.\n \n \"It's just political rhetoric to say we are not in a civil war. We've been in a civil war for a long time,\" said Pat Lang, the former top Middle East intelligence official at the Pentagon.\n \n Other experts said Iraq is on the verge of a full-scale civil war with civilians on both sides being slaughtered. Incidents in the past two weeks south of Baghdad, with apparently retaliatory killings of Sunni and Shia civilians, point in that direction, they say.\n \n Also of concern were media accounts that hard-line Shia militia members are being deployed to police hard-line Sunni communities such as Ramadi, east of Baghdad, which specialists on Iraq said was a recipe for disaster.\n \n He said the insurgency has been \"getting stronger every passing day. When the violence recedes, it is a sign that they are regrouping.\" While there is a chance the current flare of violence is the insurgency's last gasp, he said, \"I have not seen any coherent evidence that we are winning against the insurgency.\"\n \n \"Everything we thought we knew about the insurgency obviously is flawed,\" said Judith Kipper of the Council on Foreign Relations. \"It was quiet for a little while, and here it is back full force all over the country, and that is very dark news.\"\n \n Lang said there is new evidence that Saddam Hussein's regime carefully prepared in advance for the insurgency, with former Iraqi officers at the core of each group. They are well coordinated and have consistently adjusted their strategy, he said.\n \n Now the 140,000-plus U.S. troops in the country are mainly \"a nuisance\" factor in the insurgents' overall goal of preventing the new government from consolidating.\n \n All the while the insurgents are gaining strength, he said. \"The longer they keep going on the better they will get,\" said Lang, a student of military history. \"The best school of war is war.\"\n\n \n http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/world/ny-woiraq0512,0,4630319.story?coll=ny-top-headlines",
