   "It is appalling how incredibly easy it was for Cho Seung-Hui, who was not even an American citizen, to get the guns he used to kill 33 Virginians this week.\n \n It is because of the toothless gun laws of Virginia. Seung-Hui was completely legal according to the balless Virginia laws.\n \n So, you gun lovers, give all your guns a big fat kiss tonight, because guns ruled this week. The National Rifle Association was God Almighty this week.\n \n Some 33 people are dead. But your guns are all safe.\n \n God bless America! Land that guns love! And thanks above all to God Almighty the National Rifle Association!\n \n And, don't forget to kiss the scrotum of the NRA. Because you signed your own balls over to them.",

   "We shoudl all be thankful that the guy was using a gun. There are 2 good ways to kill a large number of civilians....guns and bombs. If the guy had set a bunch of bombs, there is a good chance that the body count would have been MUCH higher. \n \n Look at the IRA in England. The British started passing draconian gun laws in order to combat Irish violence so the IRA started blowing things up. Instead of killing people a trigger pull at a time, they killed them a building at a time. IF you want to kill a whole bunch of people and yourself, there is no functional difference between a suicide bombing and a gun massacre. While the gun thing would arguably be more fun, in the absence of firearms, I would imagine that these folks could get hteir kicks watching IEDs go off all over the same engineering building, killing scores of people with each blast, before finishing themselves off. \n \n Personally, the aftermath of this as far as the gun control argument is impressive to me....there does not seem to be any from that perspective. After the columbine shootings there was legislation in congress before those poor kids were even buried that did NOTHING at all to prevent future occurances (only in the US do we pass completely unrelated legislation in response to an event). This time around there are certainly calls for new gun control from the lunatic fringe, but for the most part people seem to be disenfranchised wiht the juvenile idea that we can legislate away the actions of madmen. Even more impressive, there seems to be a roughly even number of people calling for a LOOSENING of gun control laws. \n \n This makes sense. There were 2 components to the VA shooting:\n \n 1. Lunatic bent on mass murder\n 2. Helpless victims\n \n People seem to finally be grasping the fact that we can not do away with lunatics bent on mass murder, but we can do away with helpless victims...we just have to give people the chance to NOT be helpless. All we have to do is get rid of the stupid legislation that mandates that people BE defenseless.",

They did not believe in the rule of the British State, to them the laws made by Britian where the Laws of a oppressive Foriegn State.
