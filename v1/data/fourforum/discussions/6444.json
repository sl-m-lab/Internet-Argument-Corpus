For example, when we say that our pet had to be \"put to sleep\" or \"put down,\" the pet has been euthanized.\n\n \n I thought as much..... lets firstly separate animal euthanasia from euthanasia in humans  as there are some important differences between the two.\n \n An animal cannot ask to be euthanised- the decision is always made on its behalf. With a person euthanasia is a conscious request for another person to administer a substance that will cause death- the act of death is administered by a third party.

Euthanasia is the act or practice of killing or permitting the death of hopelessly sick or injured individuals (as persons or domestic animals) in a relatively painless way for reasons of mercy.

   "Bassman is right. Euthanasia is the act or practice of killing or permitting the death of hopelessly sick or injured individuals (as persons or domestic animals) in a relatively painless way for reasons of mercy.\n\n \n In broad terms yes, but specifically there are conceptual differences- see below.\n \n \nWhen you decide to take your own life it is suicide. When someone helps you take your own life that is assisted suicide.\n\n \n No, assisted suicide is where a person still takes their own life, but is provided with help that allows them to perform the act- typically the supply of a lethal dosage of a certain chemical.\n \n \nEuthanizing a human being is taking their life without knowing if they want to die.\n\n \n As I pointed out in my previous post this is an false description when applied to people. Euthanasia is when a person requests that another person ends their life on their behalf.\n \n \nAssisted suicide is taking the life of a human being because they want to die. Allowing someone to die because they want to is neither euthanasia nor assisted suicide. I don't know the word for that.\n\n \n No, again, assisted suicide is the provision of help to a person that allows them to take their own life. Allowing someone to die who wants to depends on the context- if you give them a lethal dose of drugs they use to take their life its assisted suicide, if you inject those drugs for them because they are unable to do the act themselves its euthanasia, if you allow them to die at their wish, ie. if they refuse treatment for a certain illness that is the exersise of free will.\n \n What Bassman is trying to imply by his use of the word euthanasia could perhaps be fitted under the umbrella of eugenics.",

I will stand by my statement that generally speaking, most of those who are pro-abortion subscribe to the religion of secular humanism. You are wrong, there are not many evangelical believers that are pro-abortion. Why? This is because it unbiblical. The bible teaches that murder is wrong.\n \n \nman has invented a god, and endowed him with the purpose of giving purpose to mankind. why the circular route? isnt it simpler for man to just determine his own purpose (which is what he does anyway, even if he's a believer that tells himself that its gods will)\n\n First, you are right not believing in God by all means does not indicate that life is meaningless. This is only true because God exists and has imparted meaning. However, if God does not exist then this BY ALL MEANS indicates that life is meaningless. If there is no God... man is just an unsightly abnormal wart on the face of a meaningless chance universe. If there is no God, there are no absolutes, and man has no objective absolute inherent value or dignity which sets him apart from a piece of dirt. \n Although believing is indeed rooted in faith (just like secular humanism) it is far from rooted in blind faith (unlike secular humanism). There is plenty evidence that God exists and plenty of evidence that Christianity is true. \n -Man has invented many gods. However, man has not invented the idea of God. In fact, man has really never truly invented something out of nothing. In fact there is one true God who exists. Have you ever taken molecular and cell biology? The design and complexity is unfathomable. Keep in mind that these are just a few systems in human atoms and molecules...now add to that the complexity of the soul and consciousness. This is just one microcosm of a numberless amount of systems in the universe. \n \n \n \nplease elaborate. what is the religious foundation for the pro-choice argument? also, your generalization is completely fallacious\n\n I feel my generaliztion is for the most part true. The religious foundation of a majority in the pro-choice movement is that abortion is not morally wrong. This springs from the belief that man is the measure of all things and each man writes his own right and wrong (his own ten commandments so to speak). This is rooted in the belief that God does not exist which is rooted in blind faith. \n \n \n1. the religious has no more regard for human life than the secular\n\n -Wrong wrong wrong. If God exists and if the bible is true, then God created man in His image and bestowed upon each human being objective and inherent value, meaning, and purpose. Therefore each human life has absolute value and dignity.\n \n \n2. the religious has no more moral or ethical weight than the secular\n\n -ah, the glory of moral relativism. Indeed this is a conclusion to secular humanism. You have essentially removed any foundation to say that murder (or anything else: gas chambers, mutilation, rape, torcher) is absolutely wrong. There is no right and wrong - whats right and wrong for you may not be right and wrong for Hitler but hey its all good in the hood because after all...there is no absolute morality and life is meaningless).\n \n indeed, makes sense that those who, due to their chosen faith based religion of secular humanism, can find no basis for the sacredness of human life would have a problem comprehending a view that says that human life is sacred and all people should be treated with dignity and respect.",

We know the problems we have now: unwanted pregnancies, convenience abortions, etc. But we also have self-determination, individual rights, etc. no one wants their daughter to get pregnant without wanting it.

   "please read again and notice that I said there are exceptions. I will stand by my statement that generally speaking, most of those who are pro-abortion subscribe to the religion of secular humanism. You are wrong, there are not many evangelical believers that are pro-abortion. Why? This is because it unbiblical. The bible teaches that murder is wrong.\n\n the bible teaches that sometimes murder is wrong, and sometimes its ok, as long as your priest/king/religious authority says that god says its ok. the bible teaches that sometimes its ok to completely wipe out families, including women and babies. the bible teaches that religious and ethnic purges are good for the people that god has deemed superior. the first commandment, that god is a jealous god, gives the ok for religious wars and the slaughter of the \"infidel\". i'm pretty sure i can find more text in the bible endorsing murder than prohibiting it. want to take that challenge?\n \n \nFirst, you are right not believing in God by all means does not indicate that life is meaningless. This is only true because God exists and has imparted meaning. However, if God does not exist then this BY ALL MEANS indicates that life is meaningless. If there is no God... man is just an unsightly abnormal wart on the face of a meaningless chance universe. If there is no God, there are no absolutes, and man has no objective absolute inherent value or dignity which sets him apart from a piece of dirt. \n Although believing is indeed rooted in faith (just like secular humanism) it is far from rooted in blind faith (unlike secular humanism). There is plenty evidence that God exists and plenty of evidence that Christianity is true. \n -Man has invented many gods. However, man has not invented the idea of God. In fact, man has really never truly invented something out of nothing. In fact there is one true God who exists. Have you ever taken molecular and cell biology? The design and complexity is unfathomable. Keep in mind that these are just a few systems in human atoms and molecules...now add to that the complexity of the soul and consciousness. This is just one microcosm of a numberless amount of systems in the universe. \n\n man's meaning in the universe is whatever man says his meaning in the universe is, whether you believe theres a god or not. for the secular, man determines his own meaning and acts accordingly. for the religious, man tells himself that the meaning he has given to his life (or what his pastor/prophet tells him is the meaning of his life) is given by god (even though god never comes and tells him so-and-so is the meaning of his life) and acts accordingly. ultimately, neither is more morally or ethically superior, because each gets his meaning of his life from inside his own head (except in the case where the pastor/prophet decides your life meaning for you)\n \n \nI feel my generaliztion is for the most part true. The religious foundation of a majority in the pro-choice movement is that abortion is not morally wrong. This springs from the belief that man is the measure of all things and each man writes his own right and wrong (his own ten commandments so to speak). This is rooted in the belief that God does not exist which is rooted in blind faith. \n\n and you have yet to demonstrate how believing that god does exist is not blind faith. your blind-faith based belief that god exists is the reason why so many gullible and mindless church-goers cannot think for themselves. they would rather wallow in the intellectual void of biblical myths and lies than face reality. therefore, they have a false and surrealistic world-view, and are the ones that find it easy to condemn those who think differently. it is the church-goer that shows no regard for the life of others, condemning them to the status of \"lost\" and \"infidel\". to the fundamentalist, the world would be far better off if the secular majority perished in some catastrophic natural dissaster\n \n speaking of which, its really interesting the way believers find comfort in telling themselves that massive and devastating natural disasters are the works of god, and that their purposes are to clean the earth of the evil sinners. christians are smug in thinking that god's \"methods\" of taking the lives of thousands at a time is his way of disposing of the lives of many of these meaningless sinners in a single fell swoop\n \n talk about your \"pro-lifers\"\n \n \n-Wrong wrong wrong. If God exists and if the bible is true, then God created man in His image and bestowed upon each human being objective and inherent value, meaning, and purpose. Therefore each human life has absolute value and dignity.\n\n alternatively, if god doesnt exist and the bible as a 4000 year old boogyman story, then it is evidence humans have a rich and vivid facility of imagination and ambition, and are by far capable of finding in themselves satisfying and meaningful vocations during their lifetimes. therefore human life has value and dignity\n \n \n-ah, the glory of moral relativism. Indeed this is a conclusion to secular humanism. You have essentially removed any foundation to say that murder (or anything else: gas chambers, mutilation, rape, torcher) is absolutely wrong. There is no right and wrong - whats right and wrong for you may not be right and wrong for Hitler but hey its all good in the hood because after all...there is no absolute morality and life is meaningless).\n\n the beauty of god-based morality is that you now have a foundation to say that murder, rape, torture and so on are RIGHT, when you \"recieve in your spirit\" that it is what god wants you to do. hitler himself found the bible to be his main source for justifying his actions. once you have determined that god has chosen you as the superior race, then all other life but yours is meaningless. this is what the entire old testament teaches, and is what still drives the fundamentalist mentality today\n \n \nindeed, makes sense that those who, due to their chosen faith based religion of secular humanism, can find no basis for the sacredness of human life would have a problem comprehending a view that says that human life is sacred and all people should be treated with dignity and respect.\n\n wrong. the secular man tends to find just as much \"sacredness of human life\" as the religious, often times morethan the religious, since the secular man does not condemn the majority of the world based on whether they have faith in a 4000-tear-old boggyman story",

If eugenics is going to have any major influence in the future it is going to be with regard to \"genetic health\" of potential offspring- do you bring a child into the world that is going to suffer from a serious condition that will affect its quality of life?\n \n Now while this poses a whole set of moral dilemas (and scientific ones- are we damaging our genetic diveristy by such activities?) but this is likely to be the future challenge of eugenics as opposed to the elimination of the old.\n \n With regard to slippery slopes, there is some truth in your fear- but remember it takes more than allowing assisted suicide to get to the state of the Third Reich- there are a whole set of factors that were at play there. It is also important to consider that most of the murders the Nazi's carried out were never legalised in law but carried out by offical decree from Hitler- that required a complete eradication of democracy before that could happen.",

If there is one thing i learned, that is cause and effect.\n\n \n That would be ignoring rape and incest (which is often a type of rape, despite consent), which would be outside your reasoning. As to \"why\", there are many reasons a woman would not want to have a child.\n \n \n\n You choosed to have sex, now you have a baby, you choosed to do it so accept the consequenses. \n\n \n Whether or not someone chooses to have sex does not mean they choose to remain pregnant and give birth to a child. Truly told, I don't really understand this \"you must accept the consequences\" argument. Is your philosophy that of revenge? Punishment for irresponsible behavior? Enforced self-lessness?\n \n There are a couple of analogies you should consider. You are in a building surrounded on all sides by streets. You know that there is always a chance that you will be hit by a bus every time you cross the street. One day you cross the street and are hit by a bus, paramedics are called and arrive at the scene. Do they take one look at you and say \"You must accept the consequences of your actions, we will not help\"?\n \n How about another. You are at a bar and drink heavily, wobble home and go in the front door. However, you irresponsibly leave your keys in the door; more than that you leave the door ajar. In the night you wake up to the sound of burglars in your home and call the police, and do they say \"I'm sorry but you were irresponsible and must accept all the consequences of your actions. We will not help\"?\n \n Whether or not one is irresponsible does not mean they cannot change the consequences of their actions, and gives you no right to force responsibility upon them, especially legal responsibility. Pregnancy should not be used as punishment, as a learning tool, or as a beating stick.\n \n \n\n Another oppinion of mine is, to many times we look for the easy way out in life, abortion being one of them. It just shows that your not willing to do your part in life.\n\n \n Not \"in life\". A woman's \"part in life\" is not necessarily to have children. Certainly it is not for you or the gov't to determine her \"part in life\". It means she is not ready to be self-sacrificing, which one must be to bear a child. She is not ready or not willing to share her body. Whether you believe her right or wrong, you have no moral right to force her to.\n \n \n\n And one thing i always here is that there not ready to accept the reasponsibility, Well thats not true, the fact is that you dont want to have the reasponability. Well then do you really need to be having sex?\n\n \n \"not ready to accept the responsibility\" and \"don't want to have responsibility\" are pretty much the same thing. Consenting to sex is consenting to sex, it is not consenting to anything else.

I am a christian and just saying that doesnt mean that i dont beleive in abortion but as far for my stand, abortion is murder.\n \n According to the dictinary the definition of murder is as follows:\n The unlawful killing of one human being by another. \n \n And just by stating that you can see that obviously abortion is murder. But as far as being against it and why I am isnt simply because of it being murder but why take the life of someone that hasn't even had the chance to experience this world. Yea some people say \"well it wasnt my fault i got pregnant. But the fact ithat it was. If there is one thing i learned, that is cause and effect. \n \n You choosed to have sex, now you have a baby, you choosed to do it so accept the consequenses. \n \n Another oppinion of mine is, to many times we look for the easy way out in life, abortion being one of them. It just shows that your not willing to do your part in life. And one thing i always here is that there not ready to accept the reasponsibility, Well thats not true, the fact is that you dont want to have the reasponability. Well then do you really need to be having sex?\n\n OK, superhippo, you are all of 15 years old. Does that automatically ordain you to stand in judgment of women older than you, to decree that they shall be forced to be pregnant when they don't wish to be.

I also have a deeply held religious belief that the greatest wrong a person can do is to bring an unwanted child into this world where we can not even properly care for the children we already have. On the other hand folks like Chloe have deeply held religious beliefs that those 6 cells are a soul bearing, fully vested human being. As a society we need to respect both of those beliefs. Chloe needs to stop calling people like me murders and we need to start respecting the religious beliefs of those who think life begins at conception. We need to find where the majority of people will be content, which is very likely to turn out to be somewhere between 10 weeks and viability, and stop allowing extremists to control the debate. The radical pro and anti choice groups should stop wasting their time and money on this divisive debate that will never be resolved and start showing real respect for LIFE by caring for the kids who have been willingly brought forth onto this planet so they have the self confidence and skills required to live a happy, meaningful life.

Read above.\n \n -theo\n\n thanks for not beating around the bush. i would just like to point out your condescending tone in accusing me of being a murderer and having no moral conscience. my point is that you have no right to be so judgemental to anyone that supports the choice of abortion, because abortion is no more the act of killing an unborn baby than is contraception. abortion is an alternative form of contraception, although you may not want to look at it that way. the purpose of abortion is to allow people to have sex without becoming parents. this entails destroying the cells that would otherwise develop into a baby. the purpose of contraception is to allow people to have sex without becoming parents. this entails destroying the cells that would otherwise develop into a baby.\n \n your view, that it is ok to destroy the material that babies are made of via contraception, yet morally bankrupt to destroy the material that babies are made of via abortion, makes no sense to me, but that is your view and i will leave it as that. however, by what i just said, and by your own admission, you have no right to make judgements about anybody's morality, so please refrain from doing so",

   "Contraception fails. A woman and her partner may have been stringently careful in using contraception and yet a pregnancy results.\n \n Also, in view of the woefully inadequate and incomplete sex education that rabid anti-choice women-hating folk would impose upon young people, it must be remembered that many sexually active people are not adequately informed about contraceptive choices, as well as about STDs, as well as being denied access to contraceptives by pharmacists who think they are above the law and can rule on contraceptive use with the same authority of a judge.\n \n It must also be acknowledged that women are forced to engage in sexual activity without contraception because they are in bullying relationships and haven't been able to leave such relationships.\n \n It cannot be argued that every woman has free and knowledgeable access to contraception, that her relationship allows her such freedom and knowledge. Many major patriarchal religions are opposed to contraception and opposed to knowledge about contraception. These religions will have to be convinced to keep their yaps shut and curb their awesome powers to block the availability of contraception if we are to have a situation where every woman has free and knowledgable access to contraception.",
