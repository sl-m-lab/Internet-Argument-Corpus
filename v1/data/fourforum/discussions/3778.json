   "Well, you say it's human nature to kill. But why? What makes people want to kill?\n \n It's more than just a simple explanation. \n \n First of all, people are territorial. We embrace the concept of ownership and property. Secondly, we are a jealous species. The thing that tempers these instinctive ideals are knowing right from wrong and knowing the limits of acceptable behavior in society. \n \n With the rash of \"permissive\" attitude towards behavior, our society has created a very bad situation where the criminal isn't responsible for his crime... the blame is always laid upon something else. \n \n I'm disturbed by the recent trend against punishment for children. What is easily forgotten is that punishment must be levied out at the basest of levels for a child. I am all for spanking a child who is misbehaving. That is not child abuse. It is teaching a child that bad behavior is not going to be tolorated. Now, if the parent goes to the point of bruising the child or injuring the child then yes, it's child abuse. \n \n Anyway, I am getting off topic. The problems we see today in society are behavioral. Kids see **** on TV (which is the shallowist form of entertainment) and they don't see the consequenses of the actions that are shown. \n \n This is just a few points regarding the problem that leads to crime and violence. And, it goes much deeper than even this. \n \n The liberals want to shift the blame to inanimate objects like guns when the real problem is the fact that kids don't know the difference between right and wrong today. This drives the point home even harder about self defense. Ask any criminal in jail what scares them more, the cops or a citizen with a gun. That is why crime is higher in areas with more gun control. The chances of armed retaliation against a violent act is greatly diminished. \n \n Mike",
