   "Even though I am an Atheist, I found these values intriguing:\n \n \"The core values identify a very specific understanding of what it means to be a disciple of Jesus Christ\"[/B]\n \n Christ-Centered:\n We believe God is the foundation of all wisdom and knowledge. Through Christ we find merciful forgiveness and an invitation to a daily, personal walk empowered by the Holy Spirit. We are led by Christ in our search for truth.\n \nI Corinthians 3:11: \"For no one can lay any foundation other than the one that has been laid; that foundation is Jesus Christ.\"\n\n Passionate learners\n We believe our faith is supported by knowledge. As a learning community, we foster a journey of lifelong learning, encouraging one another to seek truth with fervor. This spirit of academic excellence enriches our relationships, our world and our faith in Jesus Christ.\n \nII Peter 1:5-8: \"For this very reason, you must make every effort to support your faith with goodness, and goodness with knowledge, and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with endurance, and endurance with godliness, and godliness with mutual affection, and mutual affection with love. For if these things are yours and are increasing among you, they keep you from being ineffective and unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.\"\n\n Servant leaders\n We believe that servant leadership is reflected perfectly in the life and person of Jesus Christ. We humbly set aside self-interest for the interests of others, because love for others builds up God's community. By following Christ's example, we create a culture characterized by joyful service.\n \nMatthew 20:26-28: \"But whoever wishes to be great among you must be your servant, and whoever wishes to be first among you must be your slave; just as the Son of [God] came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.\"\n\n Compassionate peacemakers\n As Christian peacemakers, we embrace \"shalom\" - the peace that God intends for humanity. We are committed to build the \"peaceable kingdom\" by practicing loving kindness, restoring justice, practicing anti-racism, loving our enemies and advocating for the dispossessed. We renounce the oppressive, violent destructive powers of this world - and are willing to live our lives as examples of God's peace.\n \nMatthew 5:9: \"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.\"\n\n Global citizens\n As responsible global citizens, we see, encourage and celebrate the image of God in others. We welcome and include the 'stranger' in our midst - respecting differences in world views while seeking common ground. We wish to transcend barriers between people not only through academic teaching and learning, but also in meaningful cross-cultural exchanges. We go into the world offering our gifts and lives in service to others.\n \nII Corinthians 5:18-20: \"All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation; that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting the message of reconciliation to us. So we are ambassadors for Christ, since God is making his appeal through us; we entreat you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.\"\n",

No, I tell you, but division. From now on there will be five in one family divided against each other, three against two and two against three. They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.\" - Jesus, Luke 12\n \n Over one hundred years ago, Catherine Booth said, \"It is a bad sign for the Christianity of this day when it provokes so little opposition from the world. When the Church and the world can jog along together side by side comfortably, you may be sure there is something wrong.\" \n \n Remember what Jesus said in John 15:18 - \"If the world hates you, remember that it hated Me first. If you belonged to the world, it would love you as it's own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you.\"\n \n In addition, an old English preacher by the name of Smith Wigglesworth once said, \"If you leave people as you found them, God is not speaking through you. If you are not making people either mad or glad, there is something wrong with your ministry. If there's not a war going on, you're not doing your job.\"\n \n Another commentator, a gentleman by the name of Arthur Wallis, speaking on the Apostolic style of preaching that we see in the Book of Acts, said, \"Such preaching makes indifference to the word of God impossible - it sets the hearers into one of two camps. It's calculated to either produce a revival or a riot.\"\n \n And with this stiff-necked, Christ-denying crowd it's always a riot.\n \n John 8:24",
