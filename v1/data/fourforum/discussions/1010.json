   "African Americans with a college diploma find themselves unemployed almost twice as often as whites with the same education. Hispanics must get by on only about half of the individual income that Asian Americans and whites divvy up among the bills. \n \n \n And when blacks and Latinos are hospitalized with a heart problem, they are less likely than European Americans to receive catheterization, be sent home with beta blockers, or even be advised to take aspirin to protect their health. \n \n \n While many Americans agree that open racial bigotry is generally a thing of the past, stark disparities in daily life persist, as documented by academic researchers, the U.S. Census Bureau and the Institute of Medicine. \n \n \n Frustrated with theories plainly unable to explain the problem, sociologists increasingly are relying on a new framework to understand racism and develop solutions. \"It's not just Archie Bunker any more,\" says Troy Duster, a sociology professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and New York University who is president-elect of the American Sociological Association. \n \n \n Just in the past six months, at least five books -- including one co-authored by Duster -- have put forward a fresh analysis of racial injustice. They set aside overt prejudice and individual acts of discrimination, which they assert actually may have little impact in today's world. Instead they pull back the covers on social practices and policies sewn into the fabric of work, school and the medical system that favor whites. Even the most well-intentioned white person, they say, benefits from a legacy of accumulated preferential treatment. \n \n \n In part, these scholars hope to inject new ways of thinking into California's debate over the potential value of \"color-blind\" government policies to create a more equitable society. They aim to create new paradigms for pushing beyond historical discrimination in order to understand the roots of ongoing racial injustice. \n \n \n \"Intellectuals lost track of the ability to discuss what racism is after the Civil Rights Act,\" says Andrew Barlow, referring to the landmark 1964 legislation that prohibited employment discrimination based on race, sex, religion or national origin. Research on inequities continued to focus solely on discriminatory acts by individuals, he explains, adding, \"We are really at the beginning of a new era.\" \n \n \n In August 2002, the American Sociological Association took a stand against such attempts to abolish \"race\" as untrue and irrelevant. In a statement, the professional society urged social scientists not to ignore race classifications or stop using them as a research tool, even though they may be biological fiction. \"Those who favor ignoring race as an explicit administrative matter, in the hope that it will cease to exist as a social concept, ignore the weight of a vast body of sociological research that shows that racial hierarchies are embedded in the routine practices of social groups and institutions,\" the society wrote. \n \n Colorblind Racism \n Sally Lehrman\n \n \n \n \n\n There are also abundant survey data documenting the persistence of widespread racial prejudice forty years after the civil rights revolution. Many writers who use polling data to show the decline of racism cherry pick among these surveys and omit this evidence. Some of the most compelling evidence of tenacious prejudice comes from studies of residential discrimination. In 1992, the Detroit Area Survey found that 16 percent of whites said they would feel uncomfortable in a neighborhood where 8 percent of the residents were black, and nearly the same percentage said they were unwilling to move to such an area. If the black percentage rose to 20 percent, 40 percent of all whites indicated they would not move there, 30 percent said they would be uncomfortable, and 15 percent would try to leave the area. Were a neighborhood to be 53 percent black, 71 percent of whites would not wish to move there, 53 percent would try to leave, and 65 percent would be uncomfortable. A more recent study of four cities (Atlanta, Boston, Detroit, and Los Angeles) yielded similar results. Camille Zubrinsky Charles found that more than half of whites in these four cities expressed a preference for same-race neighborhoods, while blacks expressed a strong preference for integrated neighborhoods. \n \n Contrary to the optimism of racial realists, one finds precious little evidence, even in the polling data they use, that many white Americans believe in integrated neighborhoods, especially if that means a neighborhood with more than a very few black families. Pejorative racial stereotypes are not restricted to one's choice of residence. They continue to be fundamental to (white) American culture. When the University of Chicago's National Opinion Research Center asked people to compare blacks and other ethnic groups on a number of personal traits in 1990, they discovered that 62 percent of nonblack respondents believed that blacks were lazier than other groups, 56 percent stated that they were more prone to violence, and 53 percent thought they were less intelligent. Another report suggests that white Americans are still substantially opposed to intimate contact with African Americans. In one national survey conducted in 1978, 70 percent of whites rejected interracial marriage on principle. This hardly represents the significant change in whites' attitudes trumpeted by the proponents of racial realism. \n \n Racial Privilege and Group Position \n Because it extends far beyond individual attitudes, permeating the very structure and organization of American society, race strongly determines the ways in which Americans are treated and how they fare. White Americans, whether they know it or not, benefit as individuals and as a group from the present social pecking order. The social, political, and economic benefits of being white encourage white Americans, argues George Lipsitz, to invest in whiteness as if it were a form of venture capital and to work at increasing its value. When it comes to race, white Americans' social choices are very often molded by the relationship between whiteness and accumulated racial advantages. \n \n \n To see the pervasiveness of white privilege, consider first something as ordinary as consumer trade. As we noted in the introduction, blacks and other minorities are denied mortgages far more frequently than whites with comparable incomes. But even in other situations, including those where market forces would be expected to eclipse racial factors, race plays a powerful role. Researchers studying automobile dealerships in the Chicago area found, for example, that salespeople offer significantly lower sales prices to white men than to women or blacks, even when economic factors and bargaining strategies are held constant. A more recent study shows that in the 1990s blacks paid significantly more for car loans arranged through dealers than whites did, despite having comparable credit histories. Similarly, clerks in retail stores are frequently more concerned with the color of shoppers' skin than with their ability to pay. Cignal Clothing, a subsidiary of Merry-Go-Round Enterprises, for example, stamped an information form on the back of personal checks. The form included a section marked \"race,\" and shoppers were classified \"W\" for white, \"H\" for Hispanic, and \"07\" for black. Sociologist Joe Feagin, drawing on thirty-seven in-depth interviews with middle-class blacks in several American cities, found widespread evidence that black shoppers were treated less respectfully than their middle-class white counterparts. \"No matter how affluent and influential,\" he reports, \"a black person cannot escape the stigma of being black even while relaxing or shopping.\" \n\n Michael K.

That is false. The evidence of this abounds, and these are but two sources. Racism has simply changed, and now masquerades as \"color-blind equality\", and \"concern for white's equal rights\" or cries of \"reverse-racism\".\n\n \n Where minorities are most concerned about racism is in the area of income and advancement in the workplace. I'm short on time now and can't give a detailed response, but Linda Gottfredson has shown that for black and whites, IQ very effectively predicts where you end up in the workplace. Sure, you have white bigots out there (most are lower income people not in charge of hiring and promotion), and you have race preferences as well working the other way. Gottfredson's research implies the two offsetting forces cancel each other out, and what explain lower levels in the workplace among blacks is lower average IQs. All jobs has minimum IQ requirements, and the higher the minimum, the fewer the percentage of blacks with the required IQ. No one can be a competent doctor without a minimum IQ of, say, 115, yet only 2.5% of blacks have IQs at least this high, compared to 16% of whites, and about half of all Askenazic Jews.\n \n And as I wrote in an earlier thread, the argument of IQ test cultural bias does not hold water--for example, why does the average citizen of China that makes less than $1000 a year score a 100 on an IQ test based on pictures, while the average Black American scores an 85?",

   "As a white man living and working with blacks and latinos (<1% white), I find that minorities suffer more from hatred, fear and misunderstanding of whites than they do from discrimination by whites. Those who succeed are alianated and vilified while those who have the greatest negative impact on thier society are idolized (gangsters, drug dealers, pimps, 'playas.' and hustlers). There seems to be a lack of respect for those who succeed on their own. Those who don't repeat the local 'communtiy' propaganda are not ignored, but attacked (as being 'white'). Even those who espouse the worst of society are looked up to in many inner-city locations. Marion Barry DID smoke crack, even if the film was part of a 'right-wing smear campaign.' (It was NOT!) Yet, Barry re-gained his office!\n \n Being a victim is now something to be proud of, as long it is a group that is victimized! It used to be that victims would struggle to have revenge by living better. Now, it seems that those who take on the role of victim gain victory by having the government force others to comply with thier wishes. The result is the creation of a new class of victims! Those who were not treated as fairly as the old-victims are now victims of government bias!\n \n Enforce current laws strictly! Don't treat others differently FOR ANY REASON! Recognize the positive aspects of other races and cultures and EMULATE THEM!\n \n Finally, don't parrot other people's opinions, mold your own. Don't be afraid to change them either!\n emoticon_xgood",

Whites have been intensively indoctrinated for decades that the proper thing to do is forget about color and judge people as individuals. Even as a child growing up in the rural Mountain West 30 years ago, this message was very powerful, convincing me not to question racial preferences for a long time. \n \n During the same period of time, nonwhites have been increasingly indoctrinated that one can only find health, self-esteem, and meaning in life through race loyalty and racial identification. I see this glaring double standard as creating conditions for an eventual white backlash, where whites will begin to imitate non-whites and adopt an aggressive identity politcs. In my view, this can only be avoided if non-whites change course and begin to impose on themselves the same color-blindness they expect of whites.
