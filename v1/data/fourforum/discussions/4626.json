   "I'm not sure if this exactly fits the category, but it seems to fit it best.\n \n The Bible spoke of it; your minister warned you of it, and now it's finally coming. The Battle of Armageddon, if that's what you want to call it, is knocking at our doors. Whether you're religious or not, one thing is for sure: It will be hell for everyone.\n \n Now, I don't mean to be holding up a, \"The End is Near\" sign; I mean only to be a warmonger.\n \n The Facts\n \n \u0095 OPEC is at peak production and oil prices continue to rise.\n \u0095 China and Russia have entered into a military alliance.\n \u0095 China and Russia are both nuclear powers.\n \u0095 China has increased military spending by 12.5% this year.\n \u0095 Studies have shown that whenever a disproportional male to female population exist there have been major wars.\n \u0095 Both the United States and China have a disproportional male to female population.\n \u0095 At present there are no energy sources prepared to replace petroleum.\n \u0095 Vladimir Putin is continuing to take greater control of his government.\n \n The Inferences\n \n \u0095 Oil prices will continue to rise as oil supplies dwindle.\n \u0095 Powerful nations will secure oil sources as prices continue to rise.\n \u0095 China and Russia are preparing to counter the American military.\n \u0095 Any war between the US and the New Warsaw Pact would be fought by proxy.\n \u0095 Any invasion of Han China would result in the use of nuclear weapons.\n \u0095 We are in store for a major war.\n \u0095 Oil sources will be fought for desperately.\n \u0095 Russia and China's governments are bound to go to war quicker than governments controlled by a congress of parliament.\n \n The Predictions\n \n \u0095 The Middle East will be the primary location of WWIII.\n \u0095 The War will be fought of petroleum resources.\n \u0095 The War will be against the United States and the New Warsaw Pact(China, Russia, and Iran.)\n \u0095 Most of South-East Asia will get involved, but the European Union will sit out.\n \u0095 India will join the New Warsaw Pact.\n \u0095 The War will not resort to nuclear weapons unless an invasion of mainland United States, of Han China is made.\n \u0095 The New Warsaw Pact will win, at which point. . .\n \u0095 The European Union will get involved, and lose.\n \u0095 This war will take place in no more than 20 years. My bet is 10.\n In my previous post I have outlined the Chinese threat to America, and other such topics, and my responses have been much like this: What will be the motivation for either side to attack the other; none of them have anything to gain from it. The above is the reasoning. It may seem simple, but what it will all come down to is oil.\n \n We can't ignore the facts. China know that this war will happen, and they are preparing for it. Russia as well. Why do we sit and do nothing? China has shown the clear intention to escalate our countries to war, I say, \"Hats of to 'em.\". Better know than in ten years from now, when their economy and their military-industrial complex will have ours dwarfs. Men, prepare for Armageddon.\n \n -Tysic Cummings\n \n If you would like to read other things I have written, visit my blog, http://tysicip.blogspot.com",

While it doesn't take much political rhetoric from popularly elected officials to put big crowds of little people in the streets, those little people actually have little to gain or lose with proposed independence most likely resulting in Mainland Chinese dominance. Those who do stand to lose substantial wealth if Taiwan is swept back in China's fold by force, the back-room power actually controlling politicians in any democracy, would surely prefer the one country/two system solution to retain their wealth. \n \n The media report on Taiwan's public demonstrations for independence, over a million demonstrators, also reported on Hong Kong sympathy demonstrations for Taiwanese independence, 100 in that crowd.",

   "We have far more nuclear weapons than both Russia and China together. China's only advantage is that they have far better computer systems, and far better ways of counter offense. We launch a nuclear weapon, they launch one back sort of say. Russia, you are to right. I lived in Russia since 1967, and I imigrated to America in 2004. Russia is widely controlled by President Putin. Every day he is trying to restore the old Soviet Union. He is trying to make it communist/dictatorship like. Right now, Russians have almost as much democracy as us. But every day, Putin is trying to take absolute power and make the country soviet again. The ties between Russia and China are true. But we would lose a couple million people, but we would be able to wipe each government out in about two years. Russian military sucks. All they have is a good air force. Americans have a far better naval fleet and a better nuclear program, and our ground forces are far greater than Russia's. They are a bigger country. Doesn't matter. They have a hard time recruiting soldiers as it is. But, they have far less soldiers than us.\n Beleive me, their ground forces suck. We could wipe their ground forces out in just a week. Their air fleet is the only threat. They have better war helicopters and better military bombers that you Americans have never heard about. Anyway, the Russians are easily dealt with. But, the Chinese on the other hand.....\n They have a far better computer network, they have almost as many nuclear warheads as us, and their only advantage in war is their ground forces. America is a mile bigger than China, but as of June 2005, they have 5, 500, 620 soldiers. They have a better advantage. Their naval fleet sucks, and they have no air force. Their hypothesis is that being as their nuclear capabilities and stuff are better than ours, they have no need for an air force.\n Sir, your hypothesis is correct, I beleive their is a threat. I am a doctor at the University of Washinton D.C. and a close political analyst to the White house. I have assignments assigned by the government and I basically tell them my beleifs and what I am seeing and I give them a solution to save the American life.\n Russia, China, and North Korea are the axis of evil North Korea will have a part in World War Three if it takes place.\n North Korea and Russia are allies too. North Korea adopted the old Soviet Union rules and philosophy from Russia, and the Russians support North Korea with nuclear material, weapons, and goods they don't have. I predict that North Korea, Russia, and China will attack America, and Bush beleives it too. I am close friends with Bush, and he beleives it too. The whole government and the CIA knows it. But, we have no strategy. Americans think we are too much better in Military might, that we could squash them. Not true. I know and Bush knows that if they attack us, we stand no chance.\n Sir, thank you for your great hypothesis. You are right. If you would like to e-mail me your future political opinions and want my opinion or knowledge of what the government and I know, give me a e-mail at \n Thank You",

   "Dear Tsyic\n May I ask how you know this stuff about China and Russia possibly going to war with us? I was just wondering. Cause, see, I predicted that once, and my father said that is a bunch of ########. Why would they pick a fight with us? I mean, we are allies with China. We trade, and assist them economicly. Why would Russia attack us? Russia ever since Soviet Russia fell, has become an ally of ours. Why? I know your right, but what gives you this idea? What makes you predict this? Where did you hear this? Did the media discuss this?\n I lived in Russia ever since I was born. I immigrated to the United States of America in 2001. The Soviet Union was a country of hell. I could tell you stories. But, see, when Soviet Republics broke apart, we started developing a relationship with Russia. Vladmir Putin is trying to establish the Soviet Union again, he is taking over his government. I will give you that one. That is true. But, He can't get Ukraine, and the other old Soviet republics to join. But, see, is there like a secret hatred China and Russia have for us? Are they just pretending to be our allies?\n Please reply. I knew this, but I want to know your sources and hear from you.\n America is a superpower. Do you think if we went to war with Russia and China, we would possibly lose or win? I think we would win. See, Russia is famous for it's outstanding airforce. They have airplanes and assault helicopters Americans don't know they have. I know, cause I was a pilot in a Getiv-629.\n Anyway, China is famous for it's nuclear arsenal and outstanding ground forces. But, America has the worlds third best airforce, the worlds greatest naval fleet, and the worlds third best nuclear arsenal. We are third best cause we don't have as many. America i just weak in ground forces. But see, we could wipe a missile out of the sky before it reaches American soil. We have coast guard and people that if a missle came about, they would destroy it before it came to America. We could deploy a missle from the moon to China head on. \n I moved here from Russia when my brother was arrested. My brother is the old president of Yugoslavia that killed a lot of people. His name is Slubgdan Milosevic. I move here and became a close political advisor to the United States. I learned all that stuff from American president Bush. I brought this up to him, and he agrees. But, if a country launched a missle, we would launch a counter offensive with nuclear weapons and wipe the country out. China and Russia, one missle, we launch a dozen back, and invade with an air assault and a shitload of naval ships carrying tamahawks and cruise missles towards their bases and cities. Then we would invade with some troops, and stuff.\n -John Milosevic",

   "I think I have to echo Mr Milosevic`s question here. Why would this war break out? \n \n For dominance on the international scene? That would be such a Pyrhus victory that regardless who won, it would not be worth it. \n \n For oil? Both Russia and Iran are huge producers of oil, as is the US (even though it is a net-importer). Oil will also eventually be replaced, and while this will surely carry significant economic challanges, it will not be more so than a full scale war with other nuclear powers that are evenly matched. \n \n For ideological reasons? Russia is ruled by a madman, but he is a very clever and pragmatic madman. He is concerned with his own power and certainly not chasing some dream of a peaceful and ideal world. The chinese are very pragmatic and unless there is some drastic regime change, unlikely to make rash decissions for no apparant benefits. That leaves India and the US, and I`m convinced that even these countries will not go to war with an evenly matched enemy without some dramatic social and political change. I just don`t see any of these things happening, and even if they do, it is very questionable that they will play out in a way that will lead to another world war. These social and political uppheavals are impossible to predict how they will play out, so don`t even bother is my advice :)\n \n For domestic political reasons? This is the only factor I think could be strong enough to cause a world war. Politicians are pre-dominantly interested in retaining and securing power. That doesn`t mean that they are cruel, imoral or doesn`t care about political issues, but it is a pre-requisite for them to pursue what they believe in as well as the source of the utility they gain from their position. But that would still mean that the domestic political and social climate in the US and India has changed so dramaticly that a suicide war would be thinkable. Putin doesn`t need to wage wars to secure his position. The chinese and iranian governments might, but there are much more viable options than launching a world war.\n \n I simply don`t think it will come to pass. Another world war cannot be predicted as it requires so many factors to come into line at the same time. The cold war was the closest we came to predicting a world war, and you all know how that one played out.",
