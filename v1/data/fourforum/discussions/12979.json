   "Now it seems that sperm can be created from other human cells.\n Some people on this forum believe the human fetus should be seen as nothing but tissue without anymore rights than spilled blood.\n \n If society starts to believe the same, this could result in fetuses being' grown'\n inside women ( and eventually in artificial wombs no doubt) for harvesting cells and eventually organs or even limbs\n\n From Abortion (CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll. Jan. 10-12, 2003. N=1,002 adults nationwide. MoE \u00b1 3.), 84% of Americans would limit third trimester abortions. That means that it is highly unlikely that Americans would support late term fetuses being used for their organs - at least not as they currently exist. That 84% supporting late term restrictions also means that most pro-choice proponents would also limit late term abortions. Though the poll did not ask the reasons for their choice of late term restrictions, most reasons I have heard of here on this forum for such late term restrictions (as supported by pro-choice supporters) are that the late term fetus can have sentience, mental existence, etc. This leads to your second point...\n \nIf science could produce a fully grown human that was not a sentient being eg having the brain extracted or otherwise destroyed whilst a fetus and human parts could be harvested from it would it be a step forward for humankind or the start of a high tech dark age?\n\n Personally, I view that, if that being ever developed sentience or mental existence, then it would be highly unethical / immoral to then destroy that sentience for the sake of the organs of its body. However, if that being NEVER had sentience or any mental existence, then that part of the moral dilema would be aleviated. \n \n Nevertheless, there still remains the question of potential. If it had the potential to become a person and that potential was eradicated by, for example, destroying the brain in early embryonic/fetal development (note: this is still a not-yet-existing hypothetical we are talking about), then a moral dilemma would remain. Namely, what is worth more - that potential or the possibility of saving lives through, say, having a heart to transplant? I have mixed feelings - saving lives is good but purposely creating a potential person for that reason is troubling, even if it never did gain that spark of existence as a person. Of course, if a woman is involved (i.e. that we are not talking about purely artificial wombs in this future hypothetical scenario), then her choices would dominate.\n \n I suppose that the only situation where I would feel little moral conflict is the possibility of an organism being grown that, from its start, would never have had the potential to become a person - ex. its genetic code preventing the growth of a cortex (so that it could never have gained a mental existence). Again, all of this conjecture is in the realm of science fiction but it is not impossible that the future might bring such technologies and, meanwhile, the ethics are interesting to contemplate.",
