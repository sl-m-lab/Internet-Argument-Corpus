   "Obama - Adlutery You Can Believe In\n \n The plot thickens.\n \n From the link below:\n \n Having now spoken to someone tracking the story, I can say: \n \n 1) It's not just a silly little rumor. \n \n 2) It will break in some form shortly. The question is how prestigious an outlet breaks it. (PS, at best, it won't be that prestigious, at least at first, but there's a lot here so when someone finally touches, there is a good chance of an Edwards-like \"Oh yeah, we were working on that too\" pile-on.) Fire is being held as those who know the story try to get someone of import to break it; if they pass, it will be flooded out through secondary channels. \n \n 3) The story has a Fred Baron. Not The Fred Baron. But actually-- an even better Fred Baron. The woman is \"working\" in the Caribbean drawing a salary from.... uhhh... let's say from someone who is a big, shiny part of the dirty Chicago political machine. And it makes no sense that she's doing her supposed \"job,\" for which she seems unqualified anyway, in the Caribbean, of all places. It's unclear how she could possibly do this job at all, never mind from the Caribbean. And she's been there for at least a year. (At least.) This isn't some sabbatical or few months' of \"work\" on an island paradise. \n \n Hmm. How long until we hear about smears? \n \n Read the rest at Ace. \n \n Someone wants to know: Who is Vera Baker? \n \n Who is Vera Baker? \n \n Some people in Chicago claim she was Obama&#8217;s Finance Director for his 2004 Senate campaign. FEC Senate campaign records show she was paid a pretty penny as &#8220;Finance Director&#8221;. \n \n However, people familiar with Obama&#8217;s 2004 Senate campaign say Claire Serdiuk was Obama&#8217;s Finance Director. Looking through everything we can see online for that 2004 campaign, Claire Serdiuk is consistently listed as the Finance Director - because that&#8217;s what she was. \n \n There&#8217;s no mention of Vera Baker&#8230;but Vera Baker was paid as the &#8220;Finance Director&#8221; too. \n \n And then, suddenly, Vera Baker was relocated to New York. \n \n Right around the time Michelle Obama got incredibly angry about something. We know it was hard to tell, because Michelle&#8217;s angry about something on a good day&#8230;but this was EXTRA angry. \n \n And then, even more suddenly, Vera Baker was relocated to the island of Martinique, where she remains. \n \n Obama: Adultery You Can Believe In",

   "Here's more Obama Madness:\n \n EXCLUSIVE: Documents Show Kagan's (Obama's Supreme Court nominee) Liberal Opinion on Social Issues\n \n On abortion, Kagan wrote a memo in a case involving a prisoner who wanted the state to pay for her to have the procedure. Kagan expressed concern to Marshall that the conservative-leaning Court would use the case to rule against the woman--and possibly undo precedents protecting a woman's right to abortion.\n \n \"This case is likely to become the vehicle that this court uses to create some very bad law on abortion and/or prisoners' rights,\" she wrote in the 1988 memo.\n \n She also expressed strong liberal views in a desegregation case. Summarizing a challenge to a voluntary school desegregation program, Kagan called the program \"amazingly sensible.\" She told Marshall that state court decisions that upheld the plan recognized the \"good sense and fair-mindedness\" of local efforts. \n \n \"Let's hope this Court takes note of the same,\" she wrote in the 1987 memo. Just three years ago, the Supreme Court struck down a nearly identical plan.\n \n Kagan also wrote a memo that senators could use to question whether she believes there is a constitutional right to gay marriage.\n \n That memo summarized a 1988 case involving a prisoner serving a life sentence in New York. He argued the state of New York was required to recognize his marriage-by-proxy in Kansas - even though such marriages were illegal in New York. \n \n The basis of his argument was that New York had a duty under the Constitution's Full Faith and Credit Clause to recognize his Kansas the marriage as valid. Kagan told Marshall his position was \"at least arguably correct,\" and recommended asking for a response from New York officials.\n \n Then there was the recently disclosed memo on gun rights. In a case challenging the District of Columbia's handgun ban as unconstitutional, Kagan was blunt: \"I am not sympathetic.\" The Supreme Court took the opposite approach two years ago, striking down the D.C. gun ban as unconstitutional.\n \n Taken together, these documents are certain to provoke considerably more questions than the less controversial papers unearthed before her confirmation hearings for solicitor general.\n \n EXCLUSIVE: Documents Show Kagan's Liberal Opinion on Social Issues - Crossroads - CBS News\n \n Just what America needs - another far left, stiff-necked Obama radical.

   "Too bad Bill Clinton was one of the best presidents we've had who led the country into a new era of prosperity. I'd rather have an excellent president that suffers from zipper failure than a terrible one who stays faithful to his wife (Bush). I don't care what he does in the bedroom and neither should you, as long as he is an excellent leader, which he is.\nSlow down there...Clinton was nothing special, he just seems that way given the president after him. Clinton had little to do with the prosperity of the 90s and if he did we should also put part of the blame on him for whats happening now.\n \n \nIf I had a nickel for every time the conservatives tried to out someone over something that didn't matter...\nThen you'd be as rich as a conservative wanting a nickel for every time a liberal did the same thing.",

Bottom line, Clinton wasn't terrible, and we did pretty darn good under him regardless of factors beyond his control. Bashing him for doing Monica is ridiculous. He did lie, but so did Bush about WMDs and I don't see Easy jumping down Bush's throat for that. Besides, I'll take a harmless lie over one that costs hundreds of thousands of lives and trillions of dollars any day.\n \n \nThen you'd be as rich as a conservative wanting a nickel for every time a liberal did the same thing.\n\n \n Really? Did liberals spend more money investigating Bill's extra marital affairs than they did on 9/11?",
