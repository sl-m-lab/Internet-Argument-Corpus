Not every Republican gets to wear the banner of a saint. During the elction I heard stories from BOTH Republican and Democrats I know who had to deal with property damage and sign stealing. My DEMOCRATIC friend was nearly run off the run by a goon squad of Republican princesses because she had a Kerry bumper sticker (and she had her two small kids in the car - so much for those family protecting Republicans, huh?!) My sister in law was verbally assaulted in a parking lot for her Wellstone bumper stickers. People who do this are fine examples of XXXXXX not either party. \n \n Can you manage to think outside of narrow little boxes? There is a reason I don't belong to churches, clubs, cliques or political parties - and this is it - your dumb post is it.",
