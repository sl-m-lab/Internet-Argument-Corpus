Who do you predict to win the Democratic election?\n \n ----------------------------\n \n My response:\n \n 1. I supported Joe Lieberman, but due to his lack of support I'm closely watching Kerry and Edwards.\n \n 2. If Dean were to be elected I think he would be slaughtered by George Bush for several reasons. But we can get into that later.\n I think Edwards has a good chance of beating Bush and that Kerry would give him a tight race. \n \n 3. I'm predicting John Edwards. Besides of actual logic that I have behind this prediction, I had a dream sometime before Christmas (when Dean was at front-runner status) that Edwards won the election.",

I don't see Conservative Christians jumping over to Kerry. :-\\\n\n Actually, I read in an article in my local newspaper that many Conservative Christians were dismayed with Bush's lack of intervention in the whole gay marriage issue. Also, I don't know if you're living in a cardboard box or whether you're a denizen of Bushworld, but Bush's popularity is declining and even my diehard Conservative parents are doubting his utmost priorities lie within the appropriate area. Many of the alterations sustained by America have been due to Bush's religious ambition and his intention to appeal to the conservative christians. Even with the inclusion of these things you've got to keep other issues in mind that are vital to all walks of life.\n \n Though you're right, Bush seems to favor a less secular and more religious governmental infrastructure, so he'll probably attempt to abolish gay marriage. Even if he does manage to extract votes from certain demographs, I still don't think he'll prevail. Rest assured, Bush will likely lose. His cons outweigh his pros, and can't be disacknowledged by anything else. \n \n \nI don't think Kerry can win. Once Bush and Kerry go at it the polls will shift...

I read in my local paper he was gone for quite some time. This is not a fallacy and I'm sure records - undoctored to the interests of biased conservatives- would vouch for it. \n \n Kerry's smarter, more charismatic, can string together intelligible sentences without faltering and would likely cater to the interests of everyone. I know it's difficult to conceive Bush may lose in the next election so you try to come to his aid. Naturally, you've adopted conservative ideals and such and will do your damnedest to defend him.

Of course he's willing to bend the truth a bit; no-one's willing to intentionally and consciously desecrate the president's image.\n When I see an unbiased article that concisely asserts Bush failed his exam and also missed most of the duties he was obligated to attend based on records and colleague reports, I'm going to believe it. And that's what I read and believed. I usually draw my facts from unbiased reports, regardless of whether they be conservative, liberal or radical. If there's an irrefuted fact I'm going to absorb it. \n The grades don't lie, the media does.\n \n \nIn the end people vote with their wallets... and the economy is only getting better.\n\n \n Notice how the GDP didn't grow as much when we slightly increased the imports? Yeah, exactly. Also, many people don't attribute financial success directly to the president and many don't think the economy is always the working of ol' pres'. There's no reason to believe this will deter potential democratic voters, they've done well handling the economy the past few terms they've been in office and people are also concerned about the deficit and the honesty of the president. I'm also aware of your delusional beliefs that the economy prospered under Clinton because of the leash the republicans in congress held on him, but that's baseless, biased malarkey.\n I guarantee our economy will start lagging once PCE goes down and imports go up and embargos are lifted. It won't be bad, but this phenomenal spurt won't be perpetual, either.",

Perhaps he passed it later or after a few re-tries, but he failed terribly and was often described as inattentive and apathetic to his obligatory duties. Of course, it's difficult to draw any line between the juvenile-minded Bush of the past and the... uh... adult-minded Bush of the present?\n \n \nThe president has almost no real control over the economy... no president has.
