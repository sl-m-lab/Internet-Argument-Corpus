Now, let's think of the great socialist reforms that Roosevelt made. How about we start with Social Security. What a great reform that turned out to be. Isn't that one of the biggest economic problems in this country today? If you take an historical-economic look back into the days of socialist reform, very little of the entire alphabet soup actually made a difference on the economy. It was the war that actually brought us out of the depression. Now, the SEC, FDIC, and Glass-Stegall Act were all reforms that were more or less safeguards from the severity of crashes but were not made to pull the economy out of the depression like the other reforms were. (CCC, NIRA, WPA, etc.) As history tells, legislation is not an economic panacea. It is usually a blight on economies. They stunt growth in order to rebalance money. They sacrifice efficiency with false promises of creating more equity. (If you want me to embellish on this statement I will but not in this post). Let's consider what government does to help make the economy boom. Cutting taxes, not messing with the minimum wage, lowering interest rates (in other words, lowering the artificial rate floor and allowing an equilibrium point to be reached), tax breaks for incentive, etc. All these things are ways of taking government out of the economy and when they do, people prosper. This is completely against socialist thinking because it means government is not giving handouts. It is through growth that the economy is strong and socialism does not cultivate growth. How can you grow when startup costs for a business are way too high because of the minimum wage or taxes being too high. Who wants to expand overseas to a country with higher taxes? No one.

Now how is it that capitalism is a misreable failure?\n\n \n This is pretty typical from the die hard capitalists, and part of the willful ignorance I refer to. France certainly has some problems. Most of them are social problems that are manifesting themselves partially in their economy. Ironically enough, they are the same problems that we have...a \"world owes me\" attitude that has driven their wage expectations through the roof. \n \n the chinese economy is not capitalist. It never will be. It is at best a split system, and in the real world it is something entirely new that seems to incorporate aspects of capitalism, socialism, copmmunism, and fascist style corporatism. \n \n This next section you mis quote me badly\n \n \nAs far as the comment on the US only being prosperous because of the socialist reforms made in the 30's is completely ludicrous.

The US did not grow to be the economic superpower it is today under strictly a capitalist system, it was after depression era social programs that the US really took off as an economic super power. \n\n \n \n I did not say anythign abotu whether the Us was prosperous. There is a WORLD of difference between being prosperous and being an economic superpower. We were not an economic superpower in the 20's. That did not come until aafter WWII.\n \n \nHow about we start with Social Security. What a great reform that turned out to be. Isn't that one of the biggest economic problems in this country today? \n\n \n No, it isn't. Not even close. SS was a self funded program. The problem is not SS, the problem is the fact that the politicians have stolen all the money out of the SS trust fund. SS in and of itself has not ever really casued any problems. What it DID do was allow companies to downgrade payroll because people were not as concerned with being able to save enough money to retire. Post WWII it was a HUGE boon to US companies and Us industry because it took pension benifits out of the picture for all but the dumbest of employers.\n \n \nIf you take an historical-economic look back into the days of socialist reform, very little of the entire alphabet soup actually made a difference on the economy.

Not only that, but crime falls if you do not have people starving to death in the street. \n \n \n Let's consider what government does to help make the economy boom.

How can you grow when startup costs for a business are way too high because of the minimum wage or taxes being too high. Who wants to expand overseas to a country with higher taxes? No one. That is nipping growth not helping. \n\n \n Post WWII, with those terrible socialist programs in place that by your logic should have destroyed the US economy, the middle class in this country grew exponentially. More wealth was created in this country between 1945 and 1965 than from 1945 to our founding. \n \n We have seen pure capitalism at work in this country and it led to a primarily 2 tiered society where the lowest quality goods were pushed at the highest possible prices (as opposed to the other way around which is what capitalist theory claims we would accomplish). People were generally either fabulously rich, or working for somebody who was fabulously rich and barely making enough to keep bread on the table. That is the reality of your capitalist utopia.\n \n The other problem with capitalism also manifests itself in socialism...corruption. Nobody can argue that under our purely capitalist system corruption was not rampant. Those who had the money bought the policians, who helped ensure that they would always have the money, and those who didn't essentialylbecame second class citizens. This has not really changed that much today as our corporations spend billions to ensure that the laws passed in congress will benfiit them, even if it is to the detriment of the population at large. \n \n Face it. Capitalism is flawed. In fact, capitalist theory is flawed from the outset. Capitalist theory essentially depends on infinite growth. Infinite growth is not possible.

The point of capitalism is to find a way for growth. That is what it inspires. When resources are used up, alternative resources are found. When those are gone, new methods are used. Do you think one person back in the early automobile times thought that their cars would run on corn? Or (coming in the future) water (hydrogen cells)? I doubt it. Did the early industrialists think that electricity could come from anything but burning coal? Again doubtful. Now we are searching the winds, sun, water, and even the atoms for that power. When you give people the incentive, they will find a way and that is the fundamental idea behind capitalism. That is why I believe it works. Fundamentally, it is sound.",

   "I believe you would have to look back at the Roosevelt Administration (the other one) to see America emerging on the World's stage. President Theodore Roosevelt strengthened the Great White Fleet - not out of desire for conquest, but as a response to growing German militarism under Kaiser Wilhelm and the demonstrated prowess of the Japanese Naval arm. President Roosevelt negotiated an end to the Russo-Japanese war and prevented an early outbreak of war between Germany and France over possession of Morocco. He understood the strategic value of a canal linking the Atlantic Ocean with the pacific and took over construction from a foundering French effort. \n \n Theodore Roosevelt presided over one of the largest industrial booms in American History. A devoted capitalist, he also saw the need for workforce reforms and used the bully pulpit to mediate a coal worker's strike in Pennsylvania and to break up the Northern Securities Trust. His efforts to create a \"Square Deal\" prevented communism from taking root in America. The Communist system can never take wind in a nation with a healthy prosperous middle class because communist depends on class envy.
