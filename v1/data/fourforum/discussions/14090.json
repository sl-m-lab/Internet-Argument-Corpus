   "Deborah, a prophetess, ... sent and called for Barak ..., and said to him, \"... the LORD God of Israel commanded, 'Go and deploy troops at Mount Tabor; take with you ten thousand men ... and against you I will deploy Sisera, the commander of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude at the River Kishon; and I will deliver him into your hand'?\"\n \n And Barak said to her, \"If you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go!\" ....\n \n Notice first of all that Deborah was a prophetess, a female prophet. The Lord is no respecter of persons, and considers males and females equally (1 Samuel 16:7). As a prophet, Deborah's ministry was to proclaim the messages of wisdom and instruction she received from the Lord. People would come from miles around to hear the wisdom of the Lord, and have Deborah act is a judge in interpersonal disputes. In the course of her ministry, she received a message for Barak to lead a small Israelite army against Sisera, the commander of Jabin's troops.\n \n It was the Lord's intention to not only defeat the armies of Sisera, but also to exalt Barak to the position of military commander over the armies of Israel. However, Barak was only willing to fulfill the Lord's command as long as Deborah came with him. Barak knew that the Lord was with Deborah, but he wasn't totally convinced that the Lord was going to be with him and provide him success in his battle with the armies of Sisera. He had faith, but he also had unbelief, and unbelief lead to fear. Unfortunately, his unbelief, caused him to miss the entire blessing the Lord had planed. Yes, the Lord enabled him to defeat the armies of Sisera, but he was not allowed to personally kill Sisera himself. Instead of Barak getting the full credit for the defeat of Sisera, an obscure woman named Jael was honored as the one who actually killed Sisera. In fact, in the celebratory song of victory after the conflict, Barak had to share accolades with both Deborah and Jael, all because of his limited faith mingled with unbelief.\n\n Deborah and Barak\n \n It would seem that the Barak of the 21st century (now Barack) can safely claim the blessing of God upon him.",
