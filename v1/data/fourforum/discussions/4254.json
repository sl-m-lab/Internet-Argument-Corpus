   "Just finished watching the local early morning news. Another woman was killed yesterday close to my home, she was widowed only two months ago . A man enters her home and rapes her , then slits her throat. I understand that women are generally the weaker sex, in physical strength. I know that most crimes committed by men against women , are quick , and a lot of them without much warning . But what I dont understand, is why SO MANY crimes against women continue to happen in such quantity ? When are women going to instill and BURN in their minds, THEY are a easy prey, a target, a target of deranged males, males that come in all shapes and dress, educational levels, and social status ?? ...\n \n \n When are they going to burn it in to their minds, that the system made up of the police and manmade laws CANNOT protect them . Laws are for prevention , the police are usually put on the scene AFTER the crime is committed. It is only until women become constantly aware of their environment , learn how to \"read\" a situation for \"signs\" of what it may become, and hold within them at least a miniscule distrust for males, will they have at least some defense against this horrific trend in our society. jmo, and end of rant, :(",

A question, Why do abused girls end up in abusive relationships ? My Dad was a bad tempered , violent alcoholic that beat my mother a lot and some of us kids too. As a 9 year old child, I watched him lay his big pocket knife blade across my mothers throat , saying he was going to end her miserable life.

My wife carries a commander length .45 and knows how to use it, and HAS used it on at least one occasion. My wife grew up in the country and was totally lacking any kind of critical awareness when we met. She just naturally assumed the best about everybody. It actually took her getting attacked before she was willing to do anything to safeguard herself.\n \n My mother and sister both worked at childrens mervy hosptial in kansas city for years. Childrens is in one of the worst parts of town. Shootouts in the parking garage are not that uncommon. for years my father tried to talk them into carrying a weapon, but both refused (though my sister did carry a can of mace, he was hoping for somthing a little more extreme). One night while leaving the hospital after a 15 hour shift, my sister got to her car to find it riddled with bullet holes. She went the next day and bought her own gun and took lessons in how to use it.\n \n It seems to me that part fo the problem is that women od not want to take responsibility for their own safety, or they fail to take drastic enough measures. I remember my mom and sistewr telling me about the self defense calsses that the KCMO police department provided where they taught you such worthless things as \"your car keys are an excellent weapon\" or \"pepper spray cna be more effective than a gun\" what a crock.",

It's just something to bear in mind when deciding on carrying a weapon.\n\n \n This is just a matter of training, common sense, and willingness to do more than wave your weapon around. \n \n The first thing any competent self defens einstructor should teach you is to NEVER, EVER allow your adversary to get close enough to grab your weapon.
