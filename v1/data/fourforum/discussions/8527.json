   "Lord Michael Levy, fundraiser of the Labour Party, a long0standing friend of the Prime Minister Tony Blair was arrested on suspicion wheeler-dealer finance. Well, wealthy Brits got political and state ceremonial and posts for great money. By this way we could suppose that some people who got citizenship or political asylum could make use of fundraiser's service. Boris Berezovsky who involved in wheeler-dealer finances and ties with international terrorism have got political asylum suddenly for all. Moreover Berezovsky could make provocative announcements but it got away for him (he got by reproof) any other would have been lost his status. Most likely Berezovsky's and Levy's Jewish origin played in this question and Jewish solidarity as such. In Great Britain not only money is playing important role but origin. I think that leadership of ruling party have some connection with Levy's movements somehow or other. Look, I think that Michael Levy has such post and influential ties that he could begin make more important steps that selling seats in the House of Lords namely accordance of citizenship to international terrorists (I cant understand in what way in this Jewish campaign fall terrorist Zakaev).",
