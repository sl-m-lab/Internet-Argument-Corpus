   "The main reasons I oppose the death penalty are:\n \n #1) It is permanent. If we sentence someone to life in prison, we can always free them at a later time if they are found to be innocent. If we execute someone and they are later found to be innocent, the sentence cannot be reversed.\n And this has happened. Stanford Law School did a study which found that DNA evidence would have proven innocence for 3 people. However, their study covered only 36 cases. THAT'S ONE OUT OF EVERY 12. In Illinois, 13 people have been released from death row, but only 7 have been executed. THAT'S ALMOST A 2 TO 1 RATIO. These two statistics show that the justice system is too imperfect for capital punishment to be used effectively.\n \n #2) It is costly. A death penalty case is likely to be appealed as high as it will be taken. The total cost to put someone to death (an average of $3.2 million) is more than five times the cost of putting them in prison for 60 years. \n \n #3) It is flawed. There is a greater percentage of blacks who are put to death for killing whites than there are whites who are put to death for killing blacks. The numbers are amazing: It's about 5% to .5%. No one will ever be able to convice me that 10 times more blacks deserved the death penalty.\n \n #4) It can be pushed. Lawyers want to win cases, in order to gain a reputation. Detectives want to crack a case in order to gain a reputation. Family members of those killed want a conviction in order to satisfy their own spirit. Add all three of these together with the death penalty as punishment and you have a recipie for disaster.\n The detectives push for evidence (including confessions) that are not 100% accurate. The lawyers take evidence supporting a conviction and maximize it, and the evidence opposing a conviction and minimize it. The family members testify at the trial how their lives have been hurt by the murder. The jury sees partially false evidence which has been biased by a lawyer and the emotions of the family members, and then convicts an innocent person and sentence him to death.\n In Illinois, former Gov. George Ryan ordered a mass commutation for everyone on death row because he learned that in many cases, prosecutors were witholding key evidence which could prove innocence in order to gain a conviction.\n \n Sorry for the length of the post, but I hope it helps you understand why I oppose capital punishment.",

There are only two ways the defendant can confess in court: by pleading guilty or by confessing in a testimony.\n \n If he pleads guilty, there will be no trial, so you'll never get the two witnesses your scheme also requires. Besides, you want to encourage guilty defendants to plead guilty, not discourage them; trials are expensive (and not just in monetary terms).\n \n But why would he confess in testimony? Defendants in criminal cases rarely testify unless their attorney thinks it is likely to help them. In most cases it is likely to hurt them, whether they are guilty or not. Why would one choose to testify in order to confess? And especially why would one do that if it means death penalty would become possible? It would be suicidal.\n \n And if you mean that such a confession would be squeezed out of the defendant by a skillful cross-examination, like in movies, that is not very realistic, and again you are creating powerful incentives against testifying in the first place.\n \n BTW, people actually do falsely confess in court!",

   "Why execute them when you have cheap labor? I agree with Bill O'Reilly... let's build some prisons up in isolated areas of Alaska and have them do labor. It's cheap, I'd say as effective as preventing crime as the death penalty (would you want to spend the rest of your life doing labor in Alaska? Even if you could escape... where are you going to go?), and they have to live with what they've done and regret it.\n\n \n You know, this is a very good idea! I cannot believe this hasn't been considered to a further extent than it has! I gotta start listening to that Bill O'Reilly show I guess. Instead of tax payer money going towards paying for our prisons, the prisoners can go out and make enough money to pay for their prisons to be self sufficient! They could privatize it and Microsoft would make the most brutally efficient and profitable prison in modern history! And if they get out of line emoticon_xkill OK, maybe this is going too far :)",

   "As I skimmed this debate, I realized I failed to respond to one point above:\n \n \nOh, I see. But that is a minimum requirement, not an assessment of what constitutes \"undeniable proof\".\n\n \n And this is also a minimum requirement. It will obviously vary by case, but I think that is a good minimum.\n \n My main point is that a true undeniable proof of guilt is an unreachable ideal. No matter how well the justice system works, we will always risk convicting innocent people.[/quote]\n \n Very true. But we should at least make sure that we have exhaused all possible means before we institute an irreversible punishment.\n \n \n I am going to re-summarize my main argument here:\n \n The US Justice System has some major problems. I dealt with several of them in my first post. When we have problems such as these, we don't need to complicate them by using irreversible justice unless we are sure we are carrying the justice out against the right person.\n \n Under two conditions would I support the death penalty:\n \n 1) It is a case of mass murder. I would define mass murder as either a) The person killed multiple people who had no non-geographical connection or b) The person killed people at multiple times.\n 2) The prosecution has provided enough evidence to make the case undeinable. As I mentioned, I feel that two witnesses to the crime(s) or a confession in court is sufficient. Also, we should exhaust every possible mean of proving a person innocent (ie DNA testing).\n \n When we can perfect the American Justice System more, then I would lend more support to the death penalty. However, until then, we should choose a system that is not permanent.",
