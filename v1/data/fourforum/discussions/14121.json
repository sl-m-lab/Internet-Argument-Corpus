   "Saw this on CNN:\n \n \n A 7-year-old Russian boy adopted by an American family last year was put on a return flight to Moscow this week because of violent and psychotic behavior, according to a Tennessee grandmother.\n \n The child showed up unannounced at Russia's child protection ministry Thursday, triggering an international investigation.\n \n \n Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told a Russian TV channel on Friday that his country has banned future adoptions by Americans until the United States signs a new agreement to regulate them.\n \n \n U.S. diplomats have avoided such an agreement to set responsibilities for the adopting parents, Lavrov said, \"but this latest incident has exhausted our patience.\"\n \n \n \"We are now investigating the circumstances of the boy's return to see if any crimes were committed,\" said U.S. Ambassador to Russia John Beyrle. \"We are also in close contact with the Russian government on all aspects of the case, and we know that he is being well cared for.\"\n \n \n Nancy Hansen, the Tennessee woman who put Justin Hansen on the plane in Washington, insisted she did not abandon the child, but was following instructions from a lawyer she found online.\n \n \n Hansen told CNN that she was concerned about her family's safety after a series of violent incidents and threats.\n \n \n \"I still have energy and I love children,\" Hansen said. \"It wasn't that he was just energetic and wearing us down. It was the violent tendencies and he had to be watched at all time.\"\n \n \n When her daughter, Torry Hansen, adopted the boy from a Russian orphanage last year, she asked the doctor there if he had any physical or mental problems, Nancy Hansen said.\n \n \n The doctor answered \"'He's healthy,' and turned and left,\" she said.\n \n \n Once the child learned enough English, he told his new family about the horrors of his previous life, including being beaten at the orphanage after his mother abandoned him, she said.\n \n \n He also told of an incident in which he burned down a building near the orphanage, she said.\n Russian Children's Rights Commissioner Pavel Astakhov said the child was \"completely healthy, physically and mentally\" before the adoption.\n \n \n \"Nobody withheld anything from her [Torry Hansen],\" he said. \"It's a lie.\"\n Justin told Russian officials he was abused by the American family, Astakhov said.\n \n \n \"There was a grandmother who was at home with the boys,\" he said. \"She used to shout at [Justin] a lot. When I asked how the mother treated him he burst into tears and said she used to pull his hair.\"\n \n \n Hansen said the child had a \"hit list\" of people he was targeting, including her daughter, who he said he \"wanted to kill for the house.\" He threatened to kill her grandson for a videogame, she said.\n \n \n The final incident that convinced Hansen she should send the boy back to Russia was when she caught him starting a fire with papers in his bedroom last Monday, she said. She feared the child might burn down the house and kill her family, she said.\n \n \n Hansen and her family were set to meet with Bedford County, Tennessee, Sheriff Randall Boyce on Friday afternoon but their lawyer asked to reschedule the session for next week, a sheriff's spokeswoman said.\n \n \n \"I'm not sure there's been a crime committed,\" Boyce said earlier. He was asked by the U.S. State Department to investigate.\n \n \n A State Department spokesman said the U.S. government was \"very troubled\" by the incident.\n \n \n \"As parents, my wife and I were deeply shocked by the news of Justin Hansen, and very angry that any family would act so callously toward a child that they had legally adopted,\" Ambassador Beyrle said.\n \n \n Nancy Hansen outlined for CNN the process she followed after she decided Justin must go back to Russia.\n \n \n When the lawyer she found online advised her the adoption could be reversed, Hansen booked the flight and paid the fee for a steward to escort Justin through the airport, she said.\n \n \n She hired a driver in Moscow she found online to pick the child up from the Moscow airport, she said.\n \n \n \n She found \"safe references\" for the driver online, she said.\n \n \n She then prepared a letter for Justin to present to Russian officials, which included a photo of the driver, whom she identified as \"Arthur,\" she said.\n \n \n Justin \"had never been happier\" than when he boarded the plane for Moscow, she said.\n Russian child protection officials were not happy when the child arrived unannounced at their ministry Wednesday. Nancy Hansen said when they called her there was \"a lot of yelling going on.\"\n \n \n But Hansen said after the call she believed the matter was settled and the boy was safe, until she also got a call from the U.S. Embassy. They told her she had set off an \"international incident.\"\n \n \n The U.S. State Department spokesman on Friday said it was up to the Russian government to decide whether it will suspend adoptions by Americans because of the incident.\n \n \n Ambassador Beyrle said cases of neglect are rare among the \"tens of thousands of adopted Russian children who are living happily and lovingly with their American families.\"\n \n \n \"But even one incident like this is too many, and we will get to the bottom of what went wrong,\" he said.\n \n \n The Seattle-based agency which Hansen said her daughter used to coordinate the adoption said it found out about Justin's return only Friday.\n \n \n \"We were alerted to this situation by our branch office in Moscow, Russia, and are shocked and saddened by this turn of events,\" said a spokeswoman for the World Association for Children and Parents.\n \n \n In the 1 percent of the cases where the dissolution of an adoption has been needed, the agency \"has always supported and worked closely with [adoptive] parents to assist the child in moving into a new adoptive family,\" she said.\n \nVery, very sad.\n \n I have to ask - what were these people thinking? Did they think this was like a grocery store, you could just return the spoiled food and everything would be fine?\n \n Just send the kid over on his own to Russia?\n \n These people should be blacklisted by any future adoption agencies. And likely will.",

They obviously wanted to adopt a child very much if they went all the way to Russia to adopt one so for them to return the child after a year means they must have been very frightened at what they saw in him. You may feel justified in judging and condemning them sight unseen, but knowing what I do about the Russian Orphanage system, I am not so quick to judge them.\n \n I remember an undercover show I saw a number of years ago that showed Russian Orphanages which took new borns and placed them in rooms from birth with no human interaction at all other than to feed them. These babies grew into children who were impossible to bond with in any way at all. If this boy was one of those babies then I don't blame the parents at all for returning him, especially since he was threatening to murder them by fire, and if they had other children to protect.

Was that FACT made clear to these innocent people before they adopted this child? Or was he sold like a first quality product whom they could effectively bond with and raise into a contributing member of their family, and society, here? \n \n This child was misrepresented at every level by the russians so they could wash their hands of a seriously damaged child and you seem to think that just because he was adopted by americans, he must forever be america's problem. Maybe now the russians will take seriously the responsibility to first care for their babies in orphanages and then make sure they represent them honestly when adopting them out to foreigners.\n \n \n I'm not suggesting the parents should have tried to soldier on with him alone, but surely they could have sought some professional help for him (in a psychiatric hospital in the US if needs be) before deciding to give up. \n\n \n Why must they commit anymore than the year they did once they clearly saw this child had sociopathic tendencies and couldn't bond with their family? And they did seek professional help for him, with the child welfare professionals in Russia where he came from. Had they done anything more for him here, they would have been strapped with any costs incurred, bankrupted by the bills to the detriment of the rest of their family and all for a child they realized they could never bond with. \n \n Of course to you this is some abstract debate taking place in the ether of cyberspace; but this child is real, the family is real and the costs they would have incurred had they kept him here are very real. By returning this seriously emotionally damaged child to the system which created him, they literally undid a mistake which would have haunted them for generations if they even survived him being a part of their family for the first decade or two.\n \n \n It is nothing to do with left or right. It's about Christian values and unchristian ones. Christians believe that no-one is beyond healing and redemption, certainly not at 8 years old.\n\n \n Our respective interpretations of the issue is definitely about the perspective of the right as compared to the left as our disagreement on what to do proves. And as I said earlier, they didn't deposit this child into a Dump or a hospital for the criminally insane with no hope of a life. They returned him to the very people they adopted him from with an explanation that their promises that they could bond with this child were completely misrepresented which they spent a year attempting to accomplish. For the sake of their larger family, they did the only thing they could do for the greater good. Your solution would have been at the expense of the family for a child which never should have been adopted out in the first place. Especially to a foreign family and a foreign country with a foreign culture. \n \n Just think about it Jo and place yourself in this kids head for a second, this kid was raised for around 6 years in seclusion without ever bonding with a human being in that orphanages squalid conditions in Russia, then without an adequate explanation or choice on his part was picked up and handed over to a couple he couldn't even communicate with and sent to a foreign country without even speaking the language so he couldn't communicate with anyone for the number of months it took him to learn english. Can you see how his confusion could lead to bitterness and a serious sense of abandonment? \n \n Can you see how he wouldn't appreciate being adopted by this loving family but would consider his situation only from a position of needing to do whatever in order to survive? That the other children in his life weren't siblings but were competitors to defeat and irradiate in order to further his goal to flourish? Can you see that it was all about surviving and not about bonding, for such a child? \n Now do the math and tell me this family was wrong for returning that child to sender.",

That didn't happen here.\n \n \nIt's not something you can just shrug off when you decide it's not working out.\n\n \n Boy are you ignorant.\n \n This wasn't a matter of the family finding itself burdened down with responsibilities that they never saw coming, like the kid making it impossible for them to go to their favorite night club, or keeping them up at night with endless crying.\n \n According to news reports this was a matter of life and death. The kid was planning the wholesale murder of his siblings and burning down the home that he was living in. He was intent on going out and killing people for no damn reason! He was the 7 year old equivalent of both Columbine killers!\n \n \nCertainly if the adoption doesn't work, and it doesn't in many adoption cases, sadly, then there are ways of ending the adoption. Just fedexing the child back to where he came from is not how you do it.\n\n \n So this matter wasn't handled in the best possible manner. So what? Maybe if Russia would quit trying to ship rotten children abroad and make them the problem of other nations, they wouldn't be having problems like this going on.\n \n \nAdopting a child, particularly an older child, means taking on the responsibility of the problems they inevitably have, and of addressing those problems. If you live in a country where you have to pay for the treatment your kids need, then don't adopt kids you can't afford.\n\n \n How can people wake up so foolish and ignorant, and not get hit by a bus when crossing the street?\n \n This kid wasn't just damaged, he was broken from the start. Hit lists are not symptoms of acting out or difficulty to adjusting. They're the tools of cold blooded murderers.\n \n \nIf you're going to treat it as a commercial transaction, the words you're looking for are caveat emptor.\n\n \n That works fine. But where was the disclosure of this information by Russia? Why did they intentionally hide these important facts?",
