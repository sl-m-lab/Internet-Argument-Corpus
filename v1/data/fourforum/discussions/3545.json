Flodida is missing 60,000 absentee votes, provisional votes will be challenged, some new machines have no paper trail for recount. If it is close as I believe it will be, it is going to be a circus. Last time we elected a President with 47.9% popular vote, I hope the winner this time wins both the popular and electoral vote.\n Dono",
