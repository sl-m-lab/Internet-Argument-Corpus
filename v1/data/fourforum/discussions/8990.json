   "US Senate had already passed Military Commissions Act of 2006. This document allows continuing CIA secret prisons program.

That means that Bush declared that tortures are most effective weapon of USA in its fight on terrorism.

   "It is so sad as I watch the republic die. The USSR has won in the long run. I never thought I would see the day when a US citizen could be pulled off the street, taken to prison, tortured, not allowed to challenge the imprisonment, and kept in imprison Indefinitely. That has what has happened this week in order to keep us safe we are no longer safe from our own government and our freedoms and rights have been abolished. The constitution no longer exists. It has been torn to pieces by the very people who claim to most strongly support it. The republican are turning more and more Fascist with every passing year. I guess I should expecting the american Gestapo, I mean FBI, to show up.\n \n Either that or by passing this law the republicans are trying to protect Bush from impeachment by the next congress by making it retroactive.",
