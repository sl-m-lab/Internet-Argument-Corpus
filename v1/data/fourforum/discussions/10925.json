It's like we're trying to argue why parts of quantum physics need revising with someone who does not even understand the basic models of force. \n \n I realize that there is something to be had with people who are willing to educate and research and fact check, but against people who seem so stubborn that they will not even bother running an Google search much less go to their local library and crack open a textbook, what value lies in this threads? \n \n You wouldn't discuss the details of complicated marginal taxes to someone who can't understand the idea of taxes, so why are we trying to argue with people who can't even understand the basics of science?",

I very clearly said that although different sciences come to valid conclusions on their own, that combining those conclusions into a practical, rational, provable belief system like evolution claims to be, is impossible to do.\n \n I said here:\n Now I don't even have to prove that the individual scientific studies or results they come to are wrong or in error in order to reject where they are placed as evidence in the evolutionary chart that claims evo is real.\n And here:\n All of the scientific evidence you have that you so forcefully piece together to fit your theory is in fact made up of pieces of the puzzle who's pieces may in themselves be reasonable and rational,\n And again here I admit the sciences are valid:\n So we have Quantum Mechanics, Biology, Geology, Astronomy, Physics, Gravity, Dark Matter, Black Holes, the Big Bang, the births of new Suns in an ever aging Universe, and multiple other studies going on that in and of themselves are valid and very interesting.\n So why are you asserting that I am saying that because we are incapable of placing in proper order the different results we learn from the many varied scientific studies that exist, in order to properly discern what is right and wrong based on our limited perspective, that I am automatically saying \"why bother knowing anything if we can't know everything?\" What i am saying is that only fools would make hard assertions of our origins based on a bunch of unrelated facts that they insist on forcing into a recognizable picture when they have no hope of doing it correctly. At least based on what we currently know. \n To summarize, with any and every mathematical calculation that science cyphers in order to explain some question regarding either the big bang, dark matter or black holes which are basic to really determining the age of everything according to evolutionary theory. They must first determine all of the parameters of the calculation they are pondering. If just one dimension or variable of the calculation is ignored because they don't know of its existence, (And I submit that many unknown variables exist) then the whole calculation is corrupted and any results attained are no more valuable in reality than if it was second graders doing the math.\n\n \n You keep saying we have no way of knowing how the \"puzzle pieces\" fit together. Let's carry your analogy further. If we have a bunch of puzzle pieces, we don't need all the puzzle pieces to see that it's a picture of a kitty-cat. Bluster all you want about how I'm lying about what you say, but you are conveniently accepting all that science tells you, unless it conflicts with your preconceived notions.

Here, try again to comprehend the complete message.\n [INDENT][SIZE=&quot;3&quot;][COLOR=&quot;DarkRed&quot;][Archangel] \n Let me break this down in the simplest possible terms so you two can comprehend what I'm saying here. I liken the ToE to a massive jigsaw puzzle that attempts to draw results from many scientific endeavors in order to explain a single result which is evolution by Random Mutation/Natural Selection. \n \n Now I don't even have to prove that the individual scientific studies or results they come to are wrong or in error in order to reject where they are placed as evidence in the evolutionary chart that claims evo is real. But back to the jigsaw puzzle. All of the scientific evidence you have that you so forcefully piece together to fit your theory is in fact made up of pieces of the puzzle who's pieces may in themselves be reasonable and rational, but they have either jagged or rounded edges that will never perfectly fit with the piece next to them, mainly because we don't know the right order to place them in, and we don't know what the final result should really look like based on the original order these events allegedly occurred in, and we don't know which pieces are central in gaining a clear perspective of the whole picture we are attempting to create.\nAll in all a giant \"just because I say so\" postulation.\n \nSo we have Quantum Mechanics,\nNot Evolution.\n \n Biology,\nSupported by the Scientific Theory of Evolution.\n \n Geology, Astronomy, Physics, Gravity, Dark Matter, Black Holes, the Big Bang, the births of new Suns in an ever aging Universe, and multiple other studies going on that in and of themselves are valid and very interesting.\nAnd which has nothing to do with the Scientific Theory of Evolution. This is what I talked about earlier, about you trying to include what is NOT Evolution in your misrepresentations.\n \n Evolution is not the opposite of Creationism. The opposite of creationism is ALL Science.\n \n But we just don't know enough due to our undeniable infancy in comparison to these infinite scientific studies we are attempting to understand at this early stage of our development, to hope to place them in proper context; line them up in their proper order of function; determine exactly what part they played in our development; and to what extent; and how all these different pieces of information fit together to add up to what actually exists today either in this World or in the Cosmos that we are no more that a speck of dust within. \nTell us how black holes are part of the Scientific Theory of Evolution, then!\n \nBelieving that you are capable of comprehending the origin of all that exists ...\nAnd it is claims like this that makes you look stupid. Evolution has nothing to do with the origin of all that exists, it doesn't even have to do with the origin of life. It ONLY deals with how existing life changes. All the other stuff is part of other Scientific Theories and Models. You persisting in calling these \"Evolution\" is what makes your posts so starkly dishonest and why it isn't worth dealing with endless creationist ignorance and dishonesty. When creationists bear false witness for a living, all we get from you guys is more ignorance and lies.\n \nis likened to a guppy defining all life in all of the Oceans of the World. And yet you two, and the rest of your pseudo intellectual friends around here possess the arrogance and hubris to believe you can not only comprehend it all, but define it in a rational way. If such hubris wasn't so pathetic, it would be funny. \nActually, nobody here have claimed the knowledge you now portray. You are lying again.\n \nTo summarize, with any and every mathematical calculation that science cyphers in order to explain some question regarding either the big bang, dark matter or black holes which are basic to really determining the age of everything according to evolutionary theory.\nThe Scientific Theory of Evolution does not concern itself with any of the things you list.

   " You are a liar, a deceiver and a fraud. It's well documented, even if we just look at this thread.\n \n The vast majority of biblical scholars disagree with you and state the the genesis creation story is an allegory. I'd tend to trust the people who devote their lives to studying the cultural, historical, and lingual history of the biblical authors, rather than a, what do you call me again? Oh yeah, a sanctimonious putz, and a proven liar.\n\n \n \nSince when did Jesus tell you otherwise?\n \n By the use of reason. Explaining the evolution of a microscope cell to a ignorant Israelite who frankly doesn't care is stupid and pointless. We see this with children. Try explain to a 5 year old how a thorium nuclear fast reactor works and see if they understand. That would be idiotic and stupid. Instead, adults make up all kinds of crazy and silly simple stories to explain concepts and occurrences that children cannot understand. Genesis is no different. We even see this with adults. Try explain the impact of dutch disease oil based economies on their people to the average American. That would be futile. \n \n You are a liar, a deceiver and a fraud.\n \n You have used quote mines where the authors were deliberately misquoted. Kitts and Patterson. Patterson even wrote a letter detailing JUST how wrong that quote was. You tried to argue that he was revising history. you ignored the kitts entirely. Another example was your attack on science through bumble Bees and their inability to fly due to fixed wing calculations, yet you ignored Dynamic stalling. Another example was how you use the Freaky Links TV show prop as evidence of creationism. \n \n That's just the tip of the iceberg of your lies, frauds and deception.\n \n You don't want to play this game with me. I remember many of your serious dishonest infractions. And I can go look up plenty more which prove you are indeed a liar, a deceiver and a fraud. One recent one proving you a liar was that you claimed that chimps have weak imaginations and creativity skills DESPITE my posting of a link that disproved you many months and weeks ago. You JUST made that argument AGAIN. Almost verbatim. \n \n Someone who posts something they KNOW to be false as the truth is a liar. You posted something that you were informed was FALSE as the truth.\n \n Come again? Where did I say you were a liar for how you interpret the bible?\n \n Prove to me that I did that. \n \n What I actually said, (hint: here's more evidence of your dishonest qualities) is that you are trying to tie your interpretation to what Christanity actually means without first proving your interpretation is correct. I did not say that your interpretation was dishonest, but the act of tying is. \n \n Try again and cut the dishonesty.\n\n \n Listen, both of you. You are spiritually bankrupt and scripturally illiterates. And I don't care what you think of my knowledge, understanding or beliefs. So please believe what you want to and I will continue to believe what I know is right.. I mean, you're not even smart enough to understand that God can't be proven scientifically which is why your constant demand is for evidence that He exists. But the one fact that is obvious is that it doesn't matter what I say because you guys will always, without doubt, misinterpret it on purpose and twist it into something I never even intended to say. So let me repeat myself one more time and give you guys one more chance to catch my drift. But if you don't? Tough. Because this is all I've got for you because you guys are exhausting in your shallowness.\n [Archangel] \n Let me break this down in the simplest possible terms so you two can comprehend what I'm saying here. I liken the ToE to a massive jigsaw puzzle that attempts to draw results from many scientific endeavors in order to explain a single result which is evolution by Random Mutation/Natural Selection. \n \n Now I don't even have to prove that the individual scientific studies or results they come to are wrong or in error in order to reject where they are placed as evidence in the evolutionary chart that claims evo is real. But back to the jigsaw puzzle. All of the scientific evidence you have that you so forcefully piece together to fit your theory is in fact made up of pieces of the puzzle who's pieces may in themselves be reasonable and rational, but they have either jagged or rounded edges that will never perfectly fit with the piece next to them, mainly because we don't know the right order to place them in, and we don't know what the final result should really look like based on the original order these events allegedly occurred in, and we don't know which pieces are central in gaining a clear perspective of the whole picture we are attempting to create.\n \n So we have Quantum Mechanics, Biology, Geology, Astronomy, Physics, Gravity, Dark Matter, Black Holes, the Big Bang, the births of new Suns in an ever aging Universe, and multiple other studies going on that in and of themselves are valid and very interesting. But we just don't know enough due to our undeniable infancy in comparison to these infinite scientific studies we are attempting to understand at this early stage of our development, to hope to place them in proper context; line them up in their proper order of function; determine exactly what part they played in our development; and to what extent; and how all these different pieces of information fit together to add up to what actually exists today either in this World or in the Cosmos that we are no more that a speck of dust within. \n \n Believing that you are capable of comprehending the origin of all that exists is likened to a guppy defining all life in all of the Oceans of the World. And yet you two, and the rest of your pseudo intellectual friends around here possess the arrogance and hubris to believe you can not only comprehend it all, but define it in a rational way. If such hubris wasn't so pathetic, it would be funny. \n \n To summarize, with any and every mathematical calculation that science cyphers in order to explain some question regarding either the big bang, dark matter or black holes which are basic to really determining the age of everything according to evolutionary theory. They must first determine all of the parameters of the calculation they are pondering. If just one dimension or variable of the calculation is ignored because they don't know of its existence, (And I submit that many unknown variables exist) then the whole calculation is corrupted and any results attained are no more valuable in reality than if it was second graders doing the math.\n Now goodnight...",

You're not adressing the point I made, which is that one of the most prominent interviewees (sp?) is already saying that he's been taken out of context. You're arguing that becaue someone else has made flawed documentaries, that this one must be right? That doesn't make sense to me in the slightest. I can say here and now that I've never seen any Michael Moore documentaries, though I did hear the stink kicked up over his interview tactics a few months back. I have to admit Moore's grudge against the Bush presidency is something i can sympathise with, but not something that means I believe all he says...\n \n Also, I've just noticed, I never mentioned dishonest tactics. I merely pointed out that this was the film by Ben Stein, and that PZ Meyers was interviewed for it... Guilty Conscience AA? Or perhaps you already know it's flawed and want to begin the defense now?",
