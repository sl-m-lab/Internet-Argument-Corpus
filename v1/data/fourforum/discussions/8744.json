I personally think it's hilarious. Maybe it belongs in another area, but I know some people here will appreciate it.\n \n I have yet to understand the mindset of a creationist. I mean there are holes in thier arguments big enough to drop a sun through, yet they can't see them. Maybe this parody will help them to see (although it'll probably just get me blasted).",
