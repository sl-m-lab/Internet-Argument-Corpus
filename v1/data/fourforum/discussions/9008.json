   "I do find it rather funny that southpark had an episode where they could say the S word a billion times lol yet if they had censored it, they wouldve had more viewers. same goes for the reason crime isnt censored, some primetime shows have the best ratings ever because they arent censoring crime, but if we censored crime, i guess there wouldnt be much on the news, eh? lol \n \n \n But, I guess its all a matter of morals and ethics, If someone feels guilty about watching something, they feel like theyre sinners and theyre going to want everything banned anyway, personally if I want to watch a rated R movie, I'll watch it, would I let my daughter? no, not until she is at least 16 and is able to comprehend violence and sex. same goes for MTV, and other shows on other stations. I seriously am NOT in any way uptight but I was a young girl once (ok so im still young im only 25) but as a mother I do not want my daughter watching some of these \"role models\" on mtv, remembering back to my teen and pre-teen days, i always wanted to look and act like the singers on tv, so im pretty sure most young girls now are dressing in less and less because the celebs are doing that and these young kids have no parental supervision during the day to make sure theyre not getting superficial messages from these so called role models. \n IMO i think that its good to have certain things on tv rated but its all in the parenting as well, maybe things wouldnt have to be censored at all if more parents actually \"parented\" kwim?",

   "Who the heck is Kwim?\n \n Anyway, am I the only parent who doesn't find censorship very effective parenting? I have rarely censored. My son is 12 - his father and I answer his sex questions as they come up. I don't keep porn around because I think its trash, but if sex comes up in another program we are watching I don't feel a need to sheild him from it. Same goes for violence. I don't watch stuff where the sole entertainment value is blowing things up (i.e., Rambo), but I don't shut down on all violence. We talk about these things, I answer his questions, and he knows the difference between fantasy and reality. As far as I see it, my son lives in this world and needs to understand the realities of this world - and the reality is that we sexual, we cuss, and we are violent. Of course each parent needs to raise their child as they see fit and within the moral compass they feel is right - - but personally I feel censorship should be used sparingly. The world will not be what we wish it to be, it will always be what it is.",
