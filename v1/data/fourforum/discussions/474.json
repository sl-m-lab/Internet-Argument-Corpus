   "thinkfree informed us that the \"missing links\" were missing. He never did explain what a missing link is or how it could still be missing if it were found. But in that discussion I asked him to discuss the following. He seems to have missed the question. Here is my request that has gone without response.\n \nPerhaps you would be so kind as to discuss the following: Sahelanthropus tchadensis, Ardipithecus ramidus, Australopithecus anamensis, Au. afarensis, Kenyanthropus platyops, Au. africanus, Au. garhi, Au. garhi, Au. aethiopicus, Au. robustus, Au. boisei, Homo habilis, H. georgicus, H. erectus, H. ergaster, H. antecessor, H. heidelbergensis, H. neanderthalensis.\n\n In another thread, thinkfree made the following remark:\n \nthinkfree - the two bears mentioned above are most likely related, but because of the genetic drift, they are now quite different looking.\n\n I asked the following questions that have gone unanswered.\n \nSo now, instead of defining what a kind is and giving examples, you introduce another undefined term. Genetic drift. What is genetic drift? How does that make the two bears look different? Please give several other examples of genetic drift making \"related\" organisms into different species. Please define what you mean by \"related.\" One must suppose that since the bears under discussion are very different looking that the differences must be genetic. What is the source of those genetic differences?\n\n In another thread, Calli claimed that a fossil of Archaeopteryx was questionable. She didn't back up that assertion or even explain what she meant. Since Calli knows enough to make these assertions, isn't it reasonable that she would be able to intelligently discuss the fossils and the reasons for her assertions? I asked in that thread:\n \nReally? Then present your evidence. Which of the Archaeopteryx fossils has been questioned? What was the evidence upon which this was based? What are the other possible explanations for these fossils? Of course, you will present the source of your objections. Also the qualifications of those who presented the questions - were they mathematicians and astronomers or paleontologists and ornithologists?\n \n And then please go on to discuss the fossils themselves. How many are there? What are they? Please discuss the presence or lack of the gastralia, furcula, carina, opposable hallux, fused trunk vertebrae, pneumatic bones, feathers, beak, teeth, tail (of free vertebrae), fibula, clawed digits on forelimbs, preorbital fenestra, and so on, and how these structures relate to birds.\n \n Please detail the \"status\" of these fossils, i.e., how many opinions are there, who holds these positions, and on what evidence do they base the opinion? If those who assert that the fossils of Archaeopteryx are questionable are correct, then what possible questioning of the \"status\" of the fossils can there be.\n\n I'm sure that neither thinkfree or Calli would make such remarks without some specific knowledge of the topic that they were discussing. To do so would be ignorant and mark them as dupes. The only explanation must be that they didn't see the questions.",

But in that discussion I asked him to discuss the following. He seems to have missed the question. Here is my request that has gone without response.\n \n Missing Link is an obsolete term. It means missing or not found. What we prefer is what they mean in their non-scientific thinking. There are thousands of transitional orders, classes, genera, and species. To list them all is a chore taking a few days. Please look at my Post on Evolution where I have the intertebrate evolution and transitional forms, fish to amphibian, reptile to bird as a start. Later I can add reptile to mammal. proto-ape to ape and humans if apes ane humans are not both apes. I like to remind folks that there are an estimated 400 billion ampibians in the world (frogs, salamanders, toads, sirens, and an eel like one. All amphibians are transitionals. They being as eggs in water, have a fish like stage with gills that breathe water, swim like their fish cousins, then metamorphose into air breathing lung equipped 4 legged land animals. What more beautiful example of transitional forms are there than 400 billion amphibians (that is 80 times more than every human in the world.)\n \n In another thread, thinkfree made the following remark:\n \n I asked the following questions that have gone unanswered.\n \n In another thread, Calli claimed that a fossil of Archaeopteryx was questionable. She didn't back up that assertion or even explain what she meant. Since Calli knows enough to make these assertions, isn't it reasonable that she would be able to intelligently discuss the fossils and the reasons for her assertions? I asked in that thread:\n \n There is nothing controversial in that it has bird and reptile characteristics. It is a true transition form, but the argument is whether several different reptile-bird transitionals evolved and which one actually is the ancestor of the birds. Similarly a hominid cousin of man, Australopithecus Boisei is clearly hominid but not our ancestor, Australopithecus africanus is. They were contemporaries. Homo neandertalis is a human, but not the direct ancestor of modern humans.\n \n I'm sure that neither thinkfree or Calli would make such remarks without some specific knowledge of the topic that they were discussing. To do so would be ignorant and mark them as dupes. The only explanation must be that they didn't see the questions. \n \n Missing link is a meaning less term. Transitional forms is more appropriate. Remember I posted 4 reptile bird transitionals but they were not necessarily the ancestors of modern bird. Evolution is far to complex to think that all transitionals were successful long term. Only the best adapted went on to populate the world.\n \n Our dicovery and mapping the genomes of humans and several animals is helping supply and whole new immensity of evidence for evolutionary lines.\n \n Cuchulainn",

   "There is nothing controversial in that it has bird and reptile characteristics.\n\n True, but that's not what Calli was talking about. Calli is parroting something someone told her. There are two \"controversies,\" either of which may be at the foot of her claim. I didn't see any of her previous discussion so I can't say which one she is referring to, and her single vague remark doesn't make that clear.\n \n The first controversy came to a head in 1985. It was brought up because a group of respected scientists was allowed unusual access to the London specimen for a photographic study. They wrote 4 papers, all of which were published in 1985 in The British Journal of Photography. These scientists were two astronomers, a mathematician, a medical doctor, a physicist and a photographer. Creationists don't seem to see any problem in the fact that none of these men had any expertise or experience in paleontology or ornithology. Nor do they see a problem with the fact that the papers were published in a photography journal rather than a journal of science.\n \n In spite of the fact that the claims of forgery made by these \"respected scientists\" were conclusively refuted shortly after they were made, creationists place great stock in them. Creationists are also oblivious to fact that most of these men do not support the Biblical creation but rather panspermia.\n \n Chris Nedin has written a nice treatment of this \"controversy\" at On Archaeopteryx, Astronomers, and Forgery.\n \n The second possible source of Calli's \"controversy\" could be out of context quotes by Alan Feduccia. Dr. Feduccia is a respected ornithologist who has done considerable study on bird origins. He does not agree that birds had their origins from theropod dinosaurs. Some of his remarks in this debate are often used by creationists. They don't seem to be aware that Feduccia isn't arguing for a Biblical origin either, but rather the direct descent of birds from archosaurs rather than from archosaurs through theropods.\n \nIt is a true transition form, but the argument is whether several different reptile-bird transitionals evolved and which one actually is the ancestor of the birds.\n\n Actually, no. A specific fossil cannot be, and probably will never be, identified as the ancestor of birds with any certainty. It is doubtful that the fossil record will ever be so complete as to make that possible. Your remark tends to support the confusion of creationists. They tend to represent the idea of a transitional as ancestral. Since the ancestral status of any particular fossil can't be acertained for any given fossil, and since any given fossil is usually placed in one of the major taxonomic groups, creationists feel justified in claiming that it is just a bird - thus, no transitionals exist.\n \n But if you look at life you will see that it is like a bush with many branches. What is being discovered in China is part of the bush that was the lineage from theropod to avian, as was Archaeopteryx. That bush is what is expected from evolutionary theory. There are several fossils that show a progression from dinosaur to bird. We don't expect a ladder-like chain of a single lineage that evolved until a point that it branched into the birds. There are many lines along that path that went no where but were similar to the one that became the birds.\n \nSimilarly a hominid cousin of man, Australopithecus Boisei is clearly hominid but not our ancestor, Australopithecus africanus is. They were contemporaries.\n\n There were a couple of times when more than one hominid species lived.\n \nHomo neandertalis is a human, but not the direct ancestor of modern humans.\n\n No. Possibly shared a common ancestor. DNA studies have shown that Neandertal man is not ancestral.",

   "An interesting further note to the story is that Hoyle, et al were were actually given samples from a most precious fossil. When these samples were analyzed, a \"foreign\" substance was detected. Hoyle interpreted this as evidence of forgery. When the findings were presented to the Natural History Museum, they were shocked. The \"foreign\" substance that Hoyle (an astronomer) proffered as evidence of forgery was a preservative that is applied to fossils almost universally. Hoyle was livid that he was not informed of the presence of such preservatives. The Museum was shocked that any \"respected\" scientist who undertook a detailed paleontological study would not be aware of the preservatives. Hoyle demanded further samples and the Museum declined on the grounds that samples of irreplaceable specimens should not be supplied to those who lacked the expertise to interpret the results.\n \n Creationists make a big deal about Hoyle et al. and his imagined controversy. They don't point out the amateurish nature of Hoyle's investigation. Nor do they point out that each of his objections have been ansered. There is no question about the authenticity of any Archyopteryx fossil.\n \n But isn't it curious that without exception, every single fraud or forgery has been revealed by real scientists. Isn't it curious that creationists continue to parade these as evidence against evolution (not as evidence for creationism). Since real science has rejected all of these frauds and forgerys, why do creationists still feel that they are meaningful? Since real scientists do not claim that they are evidence for evolution, how is it possible that it is evidence against evolution?\n \n But I am still disappointed. No response from Calli. Does she not wish to explain the presense of grastralia in Archaeopteryx if it is just a bird?",

Gastralia help protect and support the internal organs (like the lungs) in the middle area of the body.
