Over the past 30 years, the VA has expanded from 170 hospitals, adding 850 clinics and 206 veteran centers with an increasing emphasis on mental health. The VA also supports around 300 homeless veteran centers like the ones run by U.S.VETS, a partially non-profit organization.\n\n \n last article\n \nThe United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) estimates that on a given night some 250,000 veterans are homeless nationwide, and that as many as half a million veterans experience homeless in the course of a year; this represents around two percent of all living American veterans. All but 3 percent of homeless veterans are men, and 56 percent are black or Latino. Approximately 45 percent suffer from mental illness, and more than two-thirds suffer from substance abuse disorders. More than two-thirds of homeless veterans served in the armed forces for at least three years, and 47 percent served in the Vietnam War.\n\n 2% of the vet population. yes this is 2 too high but never the less, at any point in time, only 1% are actually homeless. \n \n while we certainly should be taking better care of our vets\n i hardly see this as \"taking a XXXX\" on our vets",

To state his random judgment as to what \"the majority of them\" are illustrates the hypocrisy this pious pretender of faith wallows in. I am not a religious man, but I have read the Bible and the Koran and found a lot of wisdom in the pages. The Bible, which I doubt VoR has read, much less studied, is full of references to the poor and to judgments such as his. The homeless are growing in our country and, contrary to what self proclaimed pundits such as VoR say, they (the majority)are not homeless by choice. The solution? A rising economy would lift all boats, but that is unlikely. Government, up to it's armpits in deficits, is inherently inefficient. Private resources , churches, charities, others are doing a valiant job but are under funded and generally overwhelmed. I don't have a solution, but I can tell you it won't be found in the prattle of VoR, the man on the mountain.",

   "unbiased facts obviously. but normally when they are unbiased i do agree with them because they support what i believe.. occasionally emoticon_xclown\n\n \n wow, so many errors in such a short post. Where to start, I guess that start.\n \n unbiased facts is redundant. A fact is not biased, the telling of it is.\n \n Normally when they are unbiased you agree with them? So does that mean sometimes you don't agree with facts? How do you disagree with a fact?\n \n So if a fact doesn't support what you believe, you don't agree with it? Pretty good stance to have, no wonder you don't believe in evolution.",

If you want to attack our government or its policies, fine. But theres no need to degrade our country, MY country, to make yourself feel better about picking on someones spelling.\n \n Oh, and your spelling of 'obvious' is... interesting.",
