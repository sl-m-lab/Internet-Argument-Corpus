   "A few weeks ago, the TV series to movie \"Dukes Of Hazard\" came out. I wanted to get opinions on this trend of more and more movies coming out based on TV shows from the 60's to the 80's. What are the best and or worse cases of this happening? \"The Hulk\" doesn't count because it's a comic book story brought to the big screen. That would be for another thread. Also, the Star Trek movies don't count because they have the same actors in them as in the series. (If it were me, I would have mentioned that.) This could be \"Wild Wild West,\" \"Lost In Space,\" Starsky & Hutch,\" \"Charlie's Angels,\" \"The Beverly Hillbillies,\" ect. Mainly, I'm refering to movies that got new actors to play the charicters. \n Also, on the subject, what TV show would be good to make into a movie and who might be good for the main charicters?\n Or is the idea of TV shows into movies just stupid?\n I'll say that the best was \"Lost In Space\" mainly because I enjoy Science Fiction and it had the best score (in my opinion.) Anyway, I want to read opinions on this. Also, this isn't limited to the 5 that I mentioned.",

   "As a fan of the 1970's TV series Emergency!, I'd like to see a jump to the big screen. Not as a remake, but as a revisit. i would like to see Randy Mantooth, Kevin Tighe, Ron Pinkard, Tim Donnelly, and Robert Fuller reprise their roles. I would also like to see: Wil Wheaton as FF/PM Bryan Gage (yes, John Gage's son), Carl Weathers as Capt. Anthony Richardson; Station 51, Malcom Jamal-Warner as David Johnson, M.D, Crystal Fox as FF/PM Yvette Johnson, and\n Joaquin Phoenix as Christopher DeSoto, M.D. Whaddyathink??? :) :) :)",

   "This is where I have to be honest. I don't really know to much about some shows in the 70's. Is Emergency something similar in the lines of \"ER\" or \"Scrubs\" today? emoticon_xdonno I know about a year or two ago, they came out with a movie called S.W.A.T. From what I hear, it was based on a show from the 70's. But now that I have heard of the show \"Emergency,\" it would not surprise me if it were made into a movie. Some of the new actors do sound familiar. The \"revisit\" idea is something similar to what the Star Trek series did. And that's sprung off 9 more movies, 3 spin-off series, and 1 prequel series. (I'm sorry, I bring of Star Trek a lot. :) ) It could be cool. Well have to wait and see.",

Then the TV series became so huge that people don't realize (or maybe even remember) that it was a movie first. A similar thing happened (or rather the exact opposet) with \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding.\" The movie was such a phenominal hit that a TV show was created called \"My Big Fat Greek Life.\" It flopped. emoticon_wow \n However, although I never saw it, I think from your post that F.R.I.E.N.D.S. would be the most likely to make it to the big screen simply because of the huge popularity of it.",

   "Hey, what would anyone think about a movie bassed off of Quantum Leap? Only, have the original actors and just bring them back. It was left off with saying that Sam never came home. But what if he did come home and leaped into himself to prevent something from taking place but didn't realize it until it's time to prevent it while he still has this gut feeling that something just isn't right?",
