   "Is anyone else embarrassed about the actions of Nancy Pelosi in Syria ? Anyone else feel she has betrayed our Foreign Policy Goals and our Country ? I'll let this article speak for me for the time being, but does anyone else think she should be arrested for Treason when she gets home ?\n \n \n \n By Ronald Kessler\n \n With her trip to Syria, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi achieved two things: She undercut her own credibility in Washington, and she spotlighted what is wrong with the Democrats' approach to national security.\n \n The spectacle of Pelosi making nice with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in Damascus and accepting at face value his claim that he is ready to \"resume the peace process\" with Israel had a large portion of official Washington tittering.\n \n At the same time, Syrian authorities were telling the local press that there had been no change in its position. And Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert told Pelosi that \"a number of Senate and House members who recently visited Damascus received the impression that despite the declarations of Bashar al-Assad, there is no change in the position of his country regarding a possible peace process with Israel.\"\n \n Pelosi's Charade\n \n Moreover, Pelosi misrepresented Israel's position to Assad, announcing that she had delivered a message from Olmert that \"Israel was ready to engage in peace talks\" with Syria. Olmert quickly issued a statement denying that.\n \n Even the Washington Post saw through the charade.\n \n \"Ms. Pelosi not only misrepresented Israel's position, but was virtually alone in failing to discern that Mr. Assad's words were mere propaganda,\" an editorial in the paper said. The editorial added that \"Ms. Pelosi's attempt to establish a shadow presidency is not only counterproductive, it is foolish.\"\n \n While that is certainly true, the specter of Pelosi naively chatting with Assad and announcing that she had helped achieve a diplomatic breakthrough also highlights all that is wrong with the Democrats' approach to foreign police today.\n \n Syria hosts the exiled leadership of Hamas, as well as other Palestinian radical groups, and is a major supplier of funds to Hezbollah. Syria is also believed to be involved in the assassination of Lebanese political figures and allowing its territory to be used by jihadists fighting against the United States-led coalition and the coalition-backed government in Iraq.\n \n History Repeats\n \n Pelosi's willingness to undercut the president and accept the word of the chief of state of a sponsor of terrorism is on a par with the Democrats' effort to set a timetable for fighting the war in Iraq. It brings to mind the efforts of Joseph P. Kennedy, the founder of the Kennedy dynasty, to appease Adolf Hitler.\n \n As ambassador to the Court of St. James, Joe Kennedy met on June 13, 1938 with Herbert von Dirksen, the German ambassador. The two got along famously, and Dirksen later reported on the conversation in great detail to Baron Ernst von Weizs\u00e4cker, the German state secretary.\n \n According to that report, Kennedy confided to the German ambassador that Neville Chamberlain, the British prime minister, was anxious to have some sort of settlement with Germany. By saying this, he undercut Great Britain's negotiating position with Hitler. Moreover, Kennedy said President Roosevelt was not anti-German and wanted friendly relations with Hitler. However, no European leader spoke well of the Germans because most of them were \"afraid of the Jews\" and did not \"dare to say anything good about Germany . . .\" Kennedy stated.\n \n Even as the two met at the German embassy in London, Hitler was planning to gobble up most of Europe and exterminate the Jews. The following year, World War II began after Hitler invaded Poland.\n \n \"Speaker Pelosi is the Neville Chamberlain of our time,\" said Brad Blakeman, a Republican strategist who was an aide in the Bush White House. \"Cowering to and appeasing the dictator of a terrorist state was a disgrace to the high office she holds. The Sryians used this visit to validate their bad behavior by propagandizing the whole visit and her anti-war stance.\"\n \n The Pelosi visit underscores that, when it comes to dealing with our enemies, the Democrats live in a dream world. Yet when another terrorist attack occurs in the U.S., they will be the first to say President Bush did not do enough to protect the country.\n \n Ronald Kessler is chief Washington correspondent of NewsMax.com",

There is such a thing as rightous indignation, just as Jesus felt and responded with when He threw the money changers out of the Temple.\n \n I realize that you all on the left feel it's your job to demonize andcondemn us on the Right but you needn't exagerate what we stand for by claiming we don't follow what we claim to believe in.

But the jews are being unfair in your opinion right ? Once again, it's wrong and unfair for the victims to do what they must to protect the innocent as all you see is the price the aggressors must pay for unprovoked violence as being oppressed by the victims of their violence.\n \n \nEven without PLO corruption there was never an opportunity to establish a state when occupying forces have control over everything entering of leaving the territories.

A billion plus dollars would have built built a very viable Palestinian State when Arafat was alive and before the Wall went up. Israel would have welcomed living in peace with Palestine and proved it by giving Arafat EVERYTHING the PLO asked for in the last peace talks led by Clinton as his last ditch effort to build a positive legacy. They even offered the impossible request of giving half of Jerusalem to Palestine. Arafat sat their in shock on a Friday afternoon, then asked till monday to take it to the PLO membership. He promised an answer by monday but on Sunday the first suicide bomb attack in 2 years took place killing 13 jews. That was the PLOs and Hammas's answer to a peace plan that offered everything the PLO had ever asked for.

Does this sound like they want to coexist but Israel wont allow it ?\n \n Hamas Charter\n Selected Excerpts\n \n Posted: February 24, 2006\n \n http://www.adl.org/main_israel/hamas_charter.htm\n \n \"Hamas has been looking forward to implement Allah's promise whatever time it might take. The prophet, prayer and peace be upon him, said: The time will not come until Muslims will fight the Jews (and kill them); until the Jews hide behind rocks and trees, which will cry: O Muslim! there is a Jew hiding behind me, come on and kill him...\n \n \"The so-called peaceful solutions, and the international conferences to resolve the Palestinian problem, are all contrary to the beliefs of the Islamic Resistance Movement. For renouncing any part of Palestine means renouncing part of the religion; the nationalism of the Islamic Resistance Movement is part of its faith, the movement educates its members to adhere to its principles and to raise the banner of Allah over their homeland as they fight their Jihad...Since when did the Unbelievers do justice to the Believers? 'And the Jews will not be pleased with thee, nor will the Christians, till thou follow their creed....' There is no solution to the Palestinian problem except by Jihad....\n \n \"In order to face the usurpation of Palestine by the Jews, we have no escape from raising the banner of Jihad. This would require the propagation of Islamic consciousness... We must spread the spirit of Jihad among the [Islamic] Umma... introducing fundamental changes in educational curricula in order to cleanse them from all vestiges of the ideological invasion which has been brought about by orientalists and missionaries.... 'I swear by that who holds in His Hands the Soul of Muhammad! I indeed wish to go to war for the sake of Allah! I will assault and kill, assault and kill, assault and kill'....\n \n \"The various Zionist Organizations which take on all sorts of names and shapes... Islam... will wipe out those organizations which are the enemy of humanity and Islam....\n \n \"The Nazism of the Jews does not skip women and children, it scares everyone. They make war against people's livelihood, plunder their moneys and threaten their honor....\n \n \"The enemies have been scheming for a long time... They took advantage of key elements in unfolding events, and accumulated a huge and influential material wealth which they put to the service of implementing their dream.... [They have] control of the world media [and use their] wealth to stir revolutions... They stood behind the French and the Communist Revolutions... They also used the money to establish clandestine organizations which are spreading around the world, in order to destroy societies and carry out Zionist interests. Such organizations are: the Freemasons, Rotary Clubs, Lions Clubs, B'nai B'rith and the like.... They also used the money to take over control of the Imperialist states and made them colonize many countries in order to exploit the wealth of those countries and spread their corruption therein... they stood behind World War I, so as to wipe out the Islamic Caliphate.... They also stood behind World War II, where they collected immense benefits from trading with war materials and prepared for the establishment of their state. They inspired the establishment of the United Nations and the Security Council... in order to rule the world by their intermediary. There was no war that broke out anywhere without their fingerprints on it... When Islam appears, all the forces of Unbelief unite to confront it, because the Community of Unbelief is one....\n \n \"The clandestine organizations which it has established... strive to demolish societies, to destroy values... It stands behind the diffusion of drugs and toxics of all kinds in order to facilitate its control and expansion....

One of the most important was Resolution 678, passed on November 29, giving Iraq a withdrawal deadline of January 15, 1991, and authorizing \"all necessary means to uphold and implement Resolution 660,\" a diplomatic formulation authorizing the use of force.\n \n The United States, especially Secretary of State James Baker, assembled a coalition of forces to join it in opposing Iraq, consisting of forces from 34 countries: Afghanistan, Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Honduras, Italy, Kuwait, Morocco, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Niger, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, South Korea, Spain, Syria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States itself. US troops represented 74% of the coalition's 660,000 troops in Iraq. Many of the coalition forces were reluctant to join; some felt that the war was an internal Arab affair, or feared increasing American influence in Kuwait. In the end, many nations were persuaded by Iraq's belligerence towards other Arab states, and offers of economic aid or debt forgiveness.\n \n",

   "Here's the PLOs phased plan for Israel destruction.\n \n http://www.iris.org.il/plophase.htm\n \n The PLO's \"Phased Plan\"\n \n In the October 1973 Yom Kippur War, the Arab states launched a surprise attack against Israel on the holiest day of the Jewish calendar. Once again they tried to eliminate Israel, further motivated this time by the desire to redeem their honor after their major defeat in the 1967 Six-Day War. Though Israel was initially caught off guard, it then regrouped and repelled the Arab attack, but not before incurring heavy casualties.\n \n The war convinced the Arabs that they would not be able to destroy Israel militarily within its post-1967 boundaries. Thus they embarked upon a new three-stage strategy for Israel's destruction, embodied in the PLO's 1974 decision commonly known as the Phased Plan (the text of which is below).\n \n The plan in brief:\n \n Through the \"armed struggle\" (i.e., terrorism), to establish an \"independent combatant national authority\" over any territory that is \"liberated\" from Israeli rule. (Article 2)\n To continue the struggle against Israel, using the territory of the national authority as a base of operations. (Article 4)\n To provoke an all-out war in which Israel's Arab neighbors destroy it entirely (\"liberate all Palestinian territory\"). (Article 8)\n Today, the Phased Plan remains relevant. Speaking just after the 1993 revelation of the Israel-PLO accord, PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat announced that the historic agreement \"will be a basis for an independent Palestinian state in accordance with the Palestine National Council resolution issued in 1974.... The PNC resolution issued in 1974 calls for the establishment of a national authority on any part of Palestinian soil from which Israel withdraws or which is liberated.\" (Radio Monte Carlo, 1 September 1993)\n \n It is worth noting that the PLO's term for the self-rule council now in place in Gaza and the West Bank is the \"Palestinian National Authority,\" echoing the language of the Phased Plan.\n \n Also note that Articles 5-6 call for a revolution in Jordan to establish a new Jordanian regime which will ally itself with the Palestinian National Authority. Historically, Jordan comprised the bulk of the Palestine territory, and a majority of its residents are of Palestinian origin. The PLO has never recognized the legitimacy of Kingdom of Jordan as a state independent of Palestine.\n \n THE PLO'S PHASED PLAN\n \n Political Programme\n \n Adopted at the 12th Session of the Palestinian National Council\n \n Cairo, June 9, 1974\n \n Text of the Phased Plan resolution:\n \n The Palestinian National Council:\n \n On the basis of the Palestinian National Charter and the Political Programme drawn up at the eleventh session, held from January 6-12, 1973; and from its belief that it is impossible for a permanent and just peace to be established in the area unless our Palestinian people recover all their national rights and, first and foremost, their rights to return and to self-determination on the whole of the soil of their homeland; and in the light of a study of the new political circumstances that have come into existence in the period between the Council's last and present sessions, resolves the following:\n \n \n To reaffirm the Palestine Liberation Organization's previous attitude to Resolution 242, which obliterates the national right of our people and deals with the cause of our people as a problem of refugees. The Council therefore refuses to have anything to do with this resolution at any level, Arab or international, including the Geneva Conference.\n The Liberation Organization will employ all means, and first and foremost armed struggle, to liberate Palestinian territory and to establish the independent combatant national authority for the people over every part of Palestinian territory that is liberated. This will require further changes being effected in the balance of power in favour of our people and their struggle.\n The Liberation Organization will struggle against any proposal for a Palestinian entity the price of which is recognition, peace, secure frontiers, renunciation of national rights and the deprival of our people of their right to return and their right to self-determination on the soil of their homeland.\n Any step taken towards liberation is a step towards the realization of the Liberation Organization's strategy of establishing the democratic Palestinian state specified in the resolutions of previous Palestinian National Councils.\n Struggle along with the Jordanian national forces to establish a Jordanian-Palestinian national front whose aim will be to set up in Jordan a democratic national authority in close contact with the Palestinian entity that is established through the struggle.\n The Liberation Organization will struggle to establish unity in struggle between the two peoples and between all the forces of the Arab liberation movement that are in agreement on this programme.\n In the light of this programme, the Liberation Organization will struggle to strengthen national unity and to raise it to the level where it will be able to perform its national duties and tasks.\n Once it is estabished, the Palestinian national authority will strive to achieve a union of the confrontation countries, with the aim of completing the liberation of all Palestinian territory, and as a step along the road to comprehensive Arab unity.\n The Liberation Organization will strive to strengthen its solidarity with the socialist countries, and with forces of liberation and progress throughout the world, with the aim of frustration all the schemes of Zionism, reaction and imperialism.\n In light of this programme, the leadership of the revolution will determine the tactics which will serve and make possible the realization of these objectives.\n The Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization will make every effort to implement this programme, and should a situation arise affecting the destiny and the future of the Palestinian people, the National Assembly will be convened in extraordinary session.",

   "And here is the Hezbollah Charter.\n \n http://www.eyeonislam.com/the-hezbollah-charter/\n \n Hezbollah Charter\n An Open Letter\n \n The Hizballah Program\n \n The Jerusalem Quarterly, number Forty-Eight, Fall 1988\n This is a slightly abridged translation of \"Nass al-Risala al-Maftuha allati wajahaha Hizballah ila-l-Mustad'afin fi Lubnan wa-l-Alam\", published February 16, 1985 in al-Safir (Beirut), and also in a separate brochure. It carries the unmistakable imprint of Sheikh Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah, the Hizballah mentor, and is inspired by his book Ma'maal-Quwma fi-l-Islam (Beirut 1979). See also his article in al-Muntalak (Beirut), October 1986.\n \n Our Identity\n We are often asked: Who are we, the Hizballah, and what is our identity? We are the sons of the umma (Muslim community) - the party of God (Hizb Allah) the vanguard of which was made victorious by God in Iran. There the vanguard succeeded to lay down the bases of a Muslim state which plays a central role in the world. We obey the orders of one leader, wise and just, that of our tutor and faqih (jurist) who fulfills all the necessary conditions: Ruhollah Musawi Khomeini. God save him!By virtue of the above, we do not constitute an organized and closed party in Lebanon. nor are we a tight political cadre. We are an umma linked to the Muslims of the whole world by the solid doctrinal and religious connection of Islam, whose message God wanted to be fulfilled by the Seal of the Prophets, i.e., Muhammad. This is why whatever touches or strikes the Muslims in Afghanistan, Iraq, the Philippines and elsewhere reverberates throughout the whole Muslim umma of which we are an integral part. Our behavior is dictated to us by legal principles laid down by the light of an overall political conception defined by the leading jurist (wilayat al-faqih).As for our culture, it is based on the Holy Koran, the Sunna and the legal rulings of the faqih who is our source of imitation (marja' al-taqlid). Our culture is crystal clear. It is not complicated and is accessible to all.\n \n No one can imagine the importance of our military potential as our military apparatus is not separate from our overall social fabric. Each of us is a fighting soldier. And when it becomes necessary to carry out the Holy War, each of us takes up his assignment in the fight in accordance with the injunctions of the Law, and that in the framework of the mission carried out under the tutelage of the Commanding Jurist.\n \n Our Fight\n The US has tried, through its local agents, to persuade the people that those who crushed their arrogance in Lebanon and frustrated their conspiracy against the oppressed (mustad'afin) were nothing but a bunch of fanatic terrorists whose sole aim is to dynamite bars and destroy slot machines. Such suggestions cannot and will not mislead our umma, for the whole world knows that whoever wishes to oppose the US, that arrogant superpower, cannot indulge in marginal acts which may make it deviate from its major objective. We combat abomination and we shall tear out its very roots, its primary roots, which are the US. All attempts made to drive us into marginal actions will fail, especially as our determination to fight the US is solid.\n \n We declare openly and loudly that we are an umma which fears God only and is by no means ready to tolerate injustice, aggression and humiliation. America, its Atlantic Pact allies, and the Zionist entity in the holy land of Palestine, attacked us and continue to do so without respite. Their aim is to make us eat dust continually. This is why we are, more and more, in a state of permanent alert in order to repel aggression and defend our religion, our existence, our dignity. They invaded our country, destroyed our villages, slit the throats of our children, violated our sanctuaries and appointed masters over our people who committed the worst massacres against our umma. They do not cease to give support to these allies of Israel, and do not enable us to decide our future according to our own wishes.\n \n In a single night the Israelis and the Phalangists executed thousands of our sons, women and children in Sabra and Shatilla. No international organization protested or denounced this ferocious massacre in an effective manner, a massacre perpetrated with the tacit accord of America's European allies, which had retreated a few days, maybe even a few hours earlier, from the Palestinian camps. The Lebanese defeatists accepted putting the camps under the protection of that crafty fox, the US envoy Philip Habib.\n \n We have no alternative but to confront aggression by sacrifice. The coordination between the Phalangists and Israel continues and develops. A hundred thousand victims - this is the approximate balance sheet of crimes committed by them and by the US against us. Almost half a million Muslims were forced to leave their homes. Their quarters were virtually totally destroyed in Nab'a, my own Beirut suburb, as well as in Burj Hammud, Dekonaneh, Tel Zaatar, Sinbay, Ghawarina and Jubeil - all in areas controlled today by the 'Lebanese Forces',. The Zionist occupation then launched its usurpatory invasion of Lebanon in full and open collusion with the Phalanges. The latter condemned all attempts to resist the invading forces. They participated in the implementation of certain Israeli plans in order to accomplish its Lebanese dream and acceded to all Israeli requests in order to gain power.\n \n And this is, in fact, what happened. Bashir Jumayyil, that butcher, seized power with the help also of OPEC countries and the Jumayyil family. Bashir tried to improve his ugly image by joining the six-member Committee of Public Safety presided over by former President Elias Sarkis, which was nothing but an American-Israeli bridge borrowed by the Phalangists in order to control the oppressed. Our people could not tolerate humiliation any more. It destroyed the oppressors, the invaders and their lackeys. But the US persisted in its folly and installed Amin Jumayyil to replace his brother. Some of his first so called achievements were to destroy the homes of refugees and other displaced persons, attack mosques, and order the army to bombard the southern suburbs of Beirut, where the oppressed people resided. He invited European troops to help him against us and signed the May 17th, [1984] accord with Israel making Lebanon an American protectorate.\n \n Our people could not bear any more treachery. It decided to oppose infidelity - be it French, American or Israeli - by striking at their headquarters and launching a veritable war of resistance against the Occupation forces. Finally, the enemy had to decide to retreat by stages.\n \n Our Objectives\n Let us put it truthfully: the sons of Hizhallah know who are their major enemies in the Middle East - the Phalanges, Israel, France and the US. The sons of our umma are now in a state of growing confrontation with them, and will remain so until the realization of the following three objectives:\n \n (a) to expel the Americans. the French and their allies definitely from Lebanon, putting an end to any colonialist entity on our land;\n (b) to submit the Phalanges to a just power and bring them all to justice for the crimes they have perpetrated against Muslims and Christians;\n (c) to permit all the sons of our people to determine their future and to choose in all the liberty the form of government they desire. We call upon all of them to pick the option of Islamic government which, alone, is capable of guaranteeing justice and liberty for all. Only an Islamic regime can stop any further tentative attempts of imperialistic infiltration into our country.\n \n These are Lebanon's objectives; those are its enemies. As for our friends, they are all the world's oppressed peoples. Our friends are also those who combat our enemies and who defend us from their evil. Towards these friends, individuals as well as organizations, we turn and say:\n \n Friends, wherever you are in Lebanon... we are in agreement with you on the great and necessary objectives: destroying American hegemony in our land; putting an end to the burdensome Israeli Occupation; beating back all the Phalangists' attempts to monopolize power and administration.\n \n Even though we have, friends, quite different viewpoints as to the means of the struggle, on the levels upon which it must be carried out, we should surmount these tiny divergencies and consolidate cooperation between us in view of the grand design.\n \n \n We are an umma which adheres to the message of Islam. We want all the oppressed to be able to study the divine message in order to bring justice, peace and tranquillity to the world. This is why we don't want to impose Islam upon anybody, as much as we that others impose upon us their convictions and their political systems. We don't want Islam to reign in Lebanon by force as is the case with the Maronites today. This is the minimum that we can accept in order to be able to accede by legal means to realize our ambitions, to save Lebanon from its dependence upon East and West, to put an end to foreign occupation and to adopt a regime freely wanted by the people of Lebanon.This is our perception of the present state of affairs. This is the Lebanon we envision. In the light of our conceptions, our opposition to the present system is the function of two factors; (1) the present regime is the product of an arrogance so unjust that no reform or modification can remedy it. It should be changed radically, and (2) World Imperialism which is hostile to Islam.We consider that all opposition in Lebanon voiced in the name of reform can only profit, ultimately, the present system. All such opposition which operates within the framework of the conservation and safeguarding of the present constitution without demanding changes at the level of the very foundation of the regime is, hence, an opposition of pure formality which cannot satisfy the interests of the oppressed masses. Likewise, any opposition which confronts the present regime but within the limits fixed by it, is an illusory opposition which renders a great service to the Jumayyil system. Moreover, we cannot be concerned by any proposition of political reform which accepts the rotten system actually in effect. We could not care less about the creation of this or that governmental coalition or about the participation of this or that political personality in some ministerial post, which is but a part of this unjust regime.The politics followed by the chiefs of political Maronism through the 'Lebanese Front' and the 'Lebanese Forces' cannot guarantee peace and tranquillity for the Christians of Lebanon, whereas it is predicated upon 'asabiyya (narrow-minded particularism), on confessional privileges and on the alliance with colonialism. The Lebanese crisis has proven that confessional privileges are one of the principal causes of the great explosion which ravaged the country. It also proved that outside help was of no use to the Christians of Lebanon, just when they need it most. The bell tolled for the fanatic Christians to rid themselves of denominational allegiance and of illusion deriving from the monopolization of privileges to the detriment of other communities. The Christians should answer the appeal from heaven and have recourse to reason instead of arms, to persuasion instead of confessionalism.\n \n \n To the Christians\n If you, Christians, cannot tolerate that Muslims share with you certain domains of government, Allah has also made it intolerable for Muslims to participate in an unjust regime, unjust for you and for us, in a regime which is not predicated upon the prescriptions (ahkam) of religion and upon the basis of the Law (the Shari'a) as laid down by Muhammad, the Seal of the Prophets. If you search for justice, who is more just than Allah? It is He who sent down from the sky the message of Islam through his successive prophets in order that they judge the people and give everyone his rights. If you were deceived and misled into believing that we anticipate vengeance against you - your fears are unjustified. For those of you who are peaceful, continue to live in our midst without anybody even thinking to trouble you.We don't wish you evil. We call upon you to embrace Islam so that you can be happy in this world and the next. If you refuse to adhere to Islam, maintain your ties with the Muslims and don't take part in any activity against them. Free yourselves from the consequences of hateful confessionalism. Banish from your hearts all fanaticism and parochialism. Open your hearts to our Call (da'wa) which we address to you. Open yourselves up to Islam where you'll find salvation and happiness upon earth and in the hereafter. We extend this invitation also to all the oppressed among the non-Muslims. As for those who belong to Islam only formally, we exhort them to adhere to Islam in religious practice and to renounce all fanaticisms which are rejected by our religion.\n \n \n World Scene\n We reject both the USSR and the US, both Capitalism and Communism, for both are incapable of laying the foundations for a just society.With special vehemence we reject UNIFIL as they were sent by world arrogance to occupy areas evacuated by Israel and serve for the latter as a buffer zone. They should be treated much like the Zionists. All should know that the goals of the Phalangists regime do not carry any weight with the Combatants of the Holy War, i.e., the Islamic resistance. This is the quagmire which awaits all foreign intervention.\n \n There, then, are our conceptions and our objectives which serve as our basis and inspire our march. Those who accept them should know that all rights belong to Allah and He bestows them. Those who reject them, we'll be patient with them, till Allah decides between us and the people of injustice.\n \n The Necessity for the Destruction of Israel (See ICT Note)\n We see in Israel the vanguard of the United States in our Islamic world. It is the hated enemy that must be fought until the hated ones get what they deserve. This enemy is the greatest danger to our future generations and to the destiny of our lands, particularly as it glorifies the ideas of settlement and expansion, initiated in Palestine, and yearning outward to the extension of the Great Israel, from the Euphrates to the Nile.\n \n Our primary assumption in our fight against Israel states that the Zionist entity is aggressive from its inception, and built on lands wrested from their owners, at the expense of the rights of the Muslim people. Therefore our struggle will end only when this entity is obliterated. We recognize no treaty with it, no cease fire, and no peace agreements, whether separate or consolidated.\n \n We vigorously condemn all plans for negotiation with Israel, and regard all negotiators as enemies, for the reason that such negotiation is nothing but the recognition of the legitimacy of the Zionist occupation of Palestine. Therefore we oppose and reject the Camp David Agreements, the proposals of King Fahd, the Fez and Reagan plan, Brezhnev's and the French-Egyptian proposals, and all other programs that include the recognition (even the implied recognition) of the Zionist entity.\n \n \n ICT note: This paragraph did not appear in the original translation published by the Jerusalem Quarterly. It is possible that this ommision is due to the fact that the source (al-Safir) for the translation did not include this text, which appears in the original Hizballah Program. The original Program was published on 16 February 1985. The organization's spokesman, Sheikh Ibrahim al-Amin read the Program at the al-Ouzai Mosque in west Beirut and afterwards it was published as an open letter \"to all the Opressed in Lebanon and the World\". It should be emphasised that none of Hizballah's web sites have published the full text of the organization's program, and they prefer to publish the 1996 electoraral program which was intended for the specific propoganda campaign before the Lebanese Parliamentary elections in 1996.",

Israel is a scapegoat for Arab regimes to avoid admitting that they are part of the problem of the ME's failures. \n\n \n Wow. Talk about having somethig XXX backwards. Israel is functionally bankrupt and has been for decades. The only reason they can afford to feed their people is US aid. Israel is a LONG ways from being an economic powerhouse. They are an economic failure. \n \n The problem is that Israel counted on a couple of things to make them a wealthy country and neither of them panned out. First, the Zionists believed they would find vast oil deposits under Israel. It seems reasonable since there is oil under virtually every other nation in the region. Things did not work out that way. Second, they counted on the olive oil trade to make them wealthy. At one time, that area was the top olive oil producer in the world. The zionists planned to seize the olive groves from the palestenians who ran them and use their wealth to help build israel.\n \n Unfortunatly (for israel) maintaining and expanding olive groves was far more difficult than they believed. The olive groves had been in the palestenians familes for 1000 years in some cases. that is, unfortunatly, the well of knowledge that was required to make those groves thrive. The palestenians were evicted and the jews moved in, and the olive groves stopped thriving. The palestenains who had been displaced were a much sought after commodity by commercial growers who were willing to pay handsomely for their expertise. Many of those palestenians olive growers died extremely wealthy. Unfortunatly (again, for israel) those guys showed the commercial growers how to make thier orchards more productive and as a result the bottom fell out of the olive oil market. \n \n So, the 2 sources of revenue that were SUPPOSED to make israel an economic powerhouse didn't work out. One turned out to be a pipe dream to begin with and the other they mismanged so badly that they destroyed it. \n \n Currently Israel is the only naiton in the ME that is not self supporting. They loose their aid money, they cease to exist. Other nations in the region due relatively well when you consider inflows and outflows. The problem with them from a \"man on the street prospective\" is that they are essentially run under a fuedalistic economic model and most of the \"men on the street\" are serfs. Serf has never been an especially pleasant profession. Jordan and the UAE are notable exceptions. In both places the government has recycled oil wealth back into infrastructure instead of simply hadning it to a privelaged few. Iran is heading in the same direction. \n \n \nNot surprising. 50 years of scapegoating is similar to political talking heads. Say something enough times and you'll believe it. At this point Arab regimes and people can't really change. \n\n \n Again, you are XXX backwards here. For 50 years Israel has been blaming the Arabs for their failures. When you walk down the street, who is the sucessful one...the beggar or the guy who puts money in his cup?? Israel is a welfare nation in the purest sense of the word. They require charity just to survive as a nation. None of the other nations in the ME have that problem. The sad thing is that Arab violence has very little to do with that. The war ends and Israel has to face the embaressing truth, which is that they simply cannot survive on thier own. This is why they go out of their way to ensure that the war never ends. \n \n Lets say that tomorrow the war ends. There is no question in my mind that to end the violence in Israel, we would haev to disarm them and send in troops to keep the peace (otherwise every time they get close to peace Israel bombs a refuge camp, or an apartment complex, or invades lebanon, or build a big wall that even THEIR OWN courts say is illegal). So, you have peace. Then what? How is Israel going to justify being a beggar nation? Without being able to point to their violence problem, how do they account for the fact that they cannot even feed their people on their own?",

It's all relative. \n \n True, but the economy of Modern Israel is diversified in various different industries and not subject to the massive energy prices shock the rest of the ME faces. \n\n \n This is true. If the cost of oil crashes to $5 per barrel tomorrow, most countries in the ME, with the exception of Egypt, Jordan and the UAE would be screwed. Now that we are done with nonsensicaly schience fiction scenarios, can we move on to a serious discussion?\n \n \nNo nation it the ME is self supporting. At least Israel isn't screwed when energy prices drop. Not to mention its industries vary from textiles to software development. Compare that to its neighbors. \n\n \n Nations in the ME were economically self sustaining when oil was at $10 per barrel, and would be today if it fell back there. The high energy costs are certainly a boon for them, but are certainly NOT a requirement. You seem to be arguing 2 different points in this post:\n \n 1: Nations in the ME are in trouble because they are reliant on energy costs, which may drop\n 2: Nations in the ME are in trouble because they are reliant on energy exports, and their supplies are dwindeling.\n \n You need to step back to economics 101, because these 2 points that you are trying to argue are mutually exclusive. If those supplies are dwindling, their cost will increase as the supply and demand curves cross. If they are not dwindling, there is still no problem for those nations becuase OPEC sets a price floor for oil and enforces it by modifying the demand curve...and OPEC is primarily controlled by ME nations. \n \n \nMaybe. Israel is intergrated into the trading sytem of the world. \n\n \n So is Jordan. So is the UAE. So is Egypt. The difference is that those nations actually have the infrastructure in place to support thier nations. Israel does not. Even if you remove oil profits from those nations, they still show a positive balance of trade. \n \n \n \nYet most of the ME nations economies are heavily dependent on a few things which can be easily manipulated. Furthermore decreasing supplies of these resources are obviously going to shaft them. As few of the nations hve taken any steps of alleviate this problem Israel stands a far better chance at success. \n\n \n Decreasing supplies of these resources will make them the wealthiest nations on the planet. Look at the past effects of oil shortages on market price. Supply shortages (an inversion of the supply/demand curve) have never resulted in linear increases in oil prices. They have ALWAYS resulted in exponential increases. It is a classic \"lifeboat\" economic scenario. Go back to some of the DOEs projections on the effect of snactions effecting the Iranian oil sector. They projected that if we placed oil targeted sanctions on Iran that resulted in a 20% output cut, that Irans oil profits would actually TRIPLE due to none linear price movement in the oil market. \n \n \nDo you have numbers on this or just opinion? Israel has the largest economy in the region with a tiny population, and much of hat economy is not from aid.\n\n \n 28% of isralis are directly employed by the government. 54% are indirectly employed by the government (employed by companies soley contracted tot he israeli government). They have a debt load of 89% of GDP, and have been stacking an additional $2 billion per year on their debt for the last decade, and by all indications that number is expected to grow. The sad part is that the massive loans being provided by the US are not even counted in there, since it is commonly accepted that they will never have to be paid back.\n \n Your country simply cannot survive with those numbers wihtout massive influxes of \"free\" money.\n \n \nYet their economies are in the tank aside from the oil revenues, but even then poverty, inflation, illiteracy, education and the rest of the indicators are anything but good. \n\n \n Yep...they would be in a world of hurt if not for the billions of dollars of daily oil revenue. warren Buffet woudl be in a world of hurt if he was not sitting on $52 billion worht of investments. Those poor, poor people!\n \n \n \nI don't disagree that Israel wants conflict. Conflict allows Israel to ignore its domestic problems, the same way Arab regimes do it to. It was once said that if Hamas gave Israel two months of solid peace, Israel would rip itself apart from domestic problems. However, Arab regimes do blame Israel for their incompetence. That is not in question.\n\n \n Maybe you could give me an example, because I can not ever recall having seen this. I will agree that certain arab regimes use Israel as a PR tool when it comes to thier own people. Israel provides a common enemy. The sauds can rally their people against israel and it helps the people forget that they are living in the most totalitarian nation on the planet. \n \n The difference is that if the war stops, and it ends foreign aid to israel, Saudi arabia just keeps on trucking along like they have been. Israel has an economic collapse. Hopefully at some point int he future the Us would stop supporting the house of saud and the saudi people would have a chance at overthrowing the tyrants that run the place, but that is a whole seperate issue. \n \n Utlimatly diversified and sucessful ME nations are the biggest threat to israel. This is why Irans nuclear program is such a threat. That program is supposed to provide elcetricity for a planned Iranian infrastructure improvement...a plan that would put Iran FAR ahead of israel in terms of industrial capability. It does not matter if Iran ever produces nuclear weapons or not. The increased industrial capability is as big a threat to israel as a nuke. \n \n Viewed in this light, Israels more recent actions suddenly make sense. By their own admission they expected to draw Syria and Iran into a direct confrontation when they invaded Lebanon. Why do it then? Becuase they knew the US had their back and that the economic results would be catastrophic for Syria and Iran, both of which have ben re-investing a significant portion of thier oil profits in infrastructure improvement...and NOT their oil infrastructure. These are nations with a lot of money to invest in improvements, a high level of literacy (70-89%) and a skilled workforce that is willing to work at a reasonable wage. THAT is the real threat to israel, and their unending agression is the only way they seem to be able to find to counter that threat.",

They get some companies like intel there by passing on US loan guarantees so even if their whole operation dies tomorrow, intel does not loose anything, and by putting price caps on labor so the israelis working there make about what mexicans do on a construction site in the US, but for most companies involvement in Israel is simply too risky. \n \n So, we are right back where we started....the Israelis profit from the conflict and cannot survive without it, while the arabs don't really seem to gain anything from it.",

The PCES expressed initial support for the first junta. Other groups, such as the ERP, condemned such impulses as collaborationist and renewed their call for an insurrection. Although some dialogue apparently took place between Colonel Majano and his supporters and some members of the radical left, the erosion of Majano's position within the military and the inability of the junta governments to stem the tide of right-wing violence, not to mention a certain suspicion among the Majanists themselves of the leftists' ultimate goals, worked against any effort to incorporate them into the governmental structure. Some observers have noted this failure to bring the left into the political process as a major shortcoming of the reformist juntas. It appears, however, that the political will to do so was lacking on both sides. This was particularly true of the Marxist guerrilla groups that had expanded their membership and their aspirations since their establishment as urban terrorist cells in the mid-1970s. \n Foreign influences on these Salvadoran guerrilla groups served in large part to convince their leadership of the need to sublimate old ideological quarrels in favor of a coordinated and cooperative effort to arouse the Salvadoran masses. The example of the Nicaraguan revolution served as both an inspiration and a loose blueprint for the Salvadorans. Nicaragua demonstrated the importance of incorporating as many sectors of society as possible into a revolutionary movement while still ensuring the predominance of a Marxist-Leninist \"vanguard\" group within the coalition. In Nicaragua the vanguard role was played by the FSLN, a group that had represented singlehandedly the pro-Cuban insurrectionist left in that country since the early 1960s. In El Salvador, the situation was more complicated. Clearly, several ideologically diverse (Maoist, pro-Soviet, and pro-Cuban) guerrilla groups could not fulfill simultaneously the role of revolutionary vanguard. Salvadorans recognized a need for unity that was not achieved until Cuba's Fidel Castro took a direct hand in the matter. The negotiating process began in Havana in December 1979, some two months after the reformist coup in El Salvador, and was concluded by May 1980, when the major guerrilla groups announced their unity under the banner of the Unified Revolutionary Directorate (Direccion Revolucionario Unificada-- DRU). Despite some continued infighting, the DRU succeeded in coordinating the groups' efforts to organize and equip their forces. \n El Salvador\n Richard A. Haggarty, ed. El Salvador: A Country Study. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1988. \n \n http://countrystudies.us/el-salvador/14.htm \n\n \n \n \n\n Like their patrons in Havana and Managua, the FMIN preaches a \"revolution without borders,\" promising to spread revolutionary violence to all countries in the region. A victory for the FMLN would produce yet another state in Central America dedicated to exporting terrorism; joining Cuba, Nicaragua, and Panama in that deadly enterprise. \"Warsaw Pact of the West.\" But most harmful to U.S. and Central American security would be the expansion of Soviet, Cuban, and Nicaraguan military power to El Salvador. As George Bush apparently told Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, the FMLN is armed and financed by Cuba and Nicaragua. This became indisputable last month when a Cessna twin-engine aircraft originating from Managua crashed in El Salvador. It was carrying to - the- rebels a cache of Soviet-made SA-7 surface-to-air missiles. This arms shipment is part of a larger effort by the Soviet Union, Cuba and Nicaragua to destabilize Central America. Despite assurances by the Soviet Foreign Ministry on September 25 that Moscow had \"since 1988 ceased arms supplies\" to Central America, at least three Soviet torpedo boats and four MI-24 Hind helicopter gunships entered Nicaragua via Cuba in September. The Pentagon reports that East bloc countries delivered over $400 million worth of arms to Nicaragua during the first nine months of this year. Just when the Warsaw Pact seems to be crumbling in Europe, a victory for the FMLN would create a \"Warsaw Pact of the West\" in Central America, consisting of Cuba, Nicaragua, Panama, and a FMLN-dominated El Salvador. These countries could use the arms supplied by Moscow not only to attack Americans and such U.S. interests in theregion as the Panama.\n \n December 5, 1989\n What Is at Risk in El Salvador\n by Holmes, Kim R.\n Executive Memorandum #256 \n \n http://www.heritage.org/Research/LatinAmerica/EM256.cfm \n",

In Islam's version of the last-days, we see that all Christians will either accept Islam or be killed. Certainly, when we look at this final picture, it is impossible to say that Islam has any real affinity for Christians or Christianity. But when analyzing Islamic teaching and traditions about the Jews, one gets a very cold feeling that the only destiny that Islam has marked out for the Jews is that of an absolute and total slaughter. We see in the Islamic traditions a dark and very persistent hatred for the Jews nearly identical to the ideology expressed through Naziism. This ideology of hatred is fully supported and nurtured throughout the Quran and the Islamic traditions. For instance, speaking of Jews, the Quran says:\n \n Amongst them we (Allah) have placed enmity and hatred till the Day of Judgment. Every time they kindle the fire of war, Allah doth extinguish it; but they (ever) strive to do mischief on earth. And Allah loveth not those who do mischief. -Surah 5:64 (Yusuf Ali)\n \n This verse makes it clear that there will be \"enmity and hatred\" against the Jews until the very end of the present age. So much for those who claim that the Quran's scorn for Jews is limited only to specific historical incidences in Muhammad's career. Not only does the Quran portray Jews as those who start wars and cause general mischief in the earth, but it also literally claims that Allah was so disgusted by the Jews, that he cursed them and literally transformed many of them into \"apes and swine,\" assigning them the lowest \"rank\" among humankind:\n \n When in their insolence they transgressed (all) prohibitions, We said to them: \"Be ye apes, despised and rejected.\" -Surah 7:166 (Yususf Ali)\n \n Those who incurred the curse of Allah and His wrath, those of whom some He transformed into apes and swine, those who worshipped evil;- these are (many times) worse in rank, and far more astray from the even path! -Surah 5:60 (Yusuf Ali)\n \n And well ye knew those amongst you who transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath: We said to them: \"Be ye apes, despised and rejected.\" -Surah 2:65 (Yusuf Ali)\n \n Among the more anti-Semitic and vocal Muslims, these verses have become absolute favorites. Walid Shoebat is a former Muslim who grew up in the Palestinian territories. Recalling being taken on a school trip to the Jerusalem zoo as a child, Walid relates, \"The Islamic teacher would tell us, 'this gorilla was originally a Jew.' I look at this now and I think, this is what Naziism teaches - in its worst form. This is being taught throughout the entire Middle East.\"1 Just as the Nazis declared that Jews were subhuman \"vermin\" in order to justify their inhumane treatment of the Jews, so has the Muslim world followed the lead of the Quran in dehumanizing the Jewish race.\n \n Now, at this point, the enterprising Muslim apologist will be quick to argue that while there are many verses in the Quran that speak of the Jews in such a negative manner, there are also other verses that speak of the Jews in a positive manner as well. While this is true it is also highly misleading. In his highly informative book, Islam and the Jews, Mark A. Gabriel, Ph. D, a former Muslim Imam and Professor of Islamic history at the prestigious Al-Azhar University in Cairo, addresses this misunderstanding of Islam's disposition toward the Jews. Gabriel explains that according to Islamic theology, those verses in the Quran that appear to be \"nice\" towards the Jews are understood to be cancelled out (mansookh) by the verses that were revealed to Muhammad later in his \"prophetic\" career. This is based on the idea of progressive revelation in Islam whereby if you have any verses that seem to contradict one another, the newer revelations given to Muhammad negate or cancel out the older revelations. This is an established and well-understood doctrine in Islam called nasik. 2 Many Qurans even include a chart in the back that lists which verses are older and which are newer in order to know which verses are cancelled out and which verses remain. Because the verses which are inflammatory and aggressive toward the Jews are newer verses, they cancel out any that might have a more conciliatory tone. This understanding is well-known throughout the Islamic world.\n \n As we trace the growth and development of anti-Semitism in Islam, we see that unfortunately, it is not limited to the Quran, but rather seems to find an even fuller expression in the infamous Hadith about the final slaughter of the Jews. We have already quoted this tradition more than once, but shall quote it again here one last time:\n \n (Muhammad said:) The last hour would not come unless the Muslims will fight against the Jews and the Muslims would kill them until the Jews would hide themselves behind a stone or a tree and a stone or a tree would say: Muslim, or the servant of Allah, there is a Jew behind me; come and kill him; but the tree Gharqad would not say, for it is the tree of the Jews. (emphasis mine) 3\n \n This apocalyptic belief of a future battle against Israel and the murder of all Jews is a deeply held belief among many Muslims. And we must remember that these anti-Semitic traditions and verses from the Quran are over a thousand years old. These sacred Islamic traditions of a final slaughter of all Jews cannot be attributed to the present day conflict with the State of Israel. As much as many today try to blame Muslim enmity toward Jews solely on Zionism and its alleged \"Nazi-like\" abuse of the victimized and oppressed Palestinians, it simply cannot be done in an honest and informed manner. The enmity of Islam toward the Jews has existed since Islam's inception. It is not a new phenomenon. And today Islam and the Muslim world is undeniably the single most anti-Semitic force on the earth. Palestinians in particular, use the anti-Semitic apocalyptic template as a basis for much of their actions toward Israel and the Jews today. Although this template is in fact one of the primary factors fueling the ongoing present conflict in Israel, it is also the most often overlooked factor by secular observers who attempt to judge the present conflict on the basis of a moral equivalency. The following quotes are all translated portions of sermons from recent years, delivered by Sheikh Ibrahim Madhi, the officially appointed Imam of the Palestinian Authority. Notice the overwhelming reliance upon the previously discussed verses and traditions that are used to justify and support the hatred against the Jews:\n We the Palestinian nation, our fate from Allah is to be the vanguard in the war against the Jews until the resurrection of the dead, as the prophet Muhammad said: 'The resurrection of the dead will not arrive until you will fight the Jews and kill them... ' We the Palestinians are the vanguard in this undertaking and in this campaign, whether or not we want this...\n Oh, our Arab brethren... Oh, our Muslim brethren... Don't leave the Palestinians alone in the war against the Jews...even if it has been decreed upon us to be the vanguard... Jerusalem, Palestine and Al Aksa (The Temple Mount), the land that Allah blessed and its surrounding areas will remain at the center of the struggle between Truth and Falsehood, between the Jews and the non-Jews on this sacred land, regardless of how many agreements are signed, regardless of how many treaties and covenants are ratified. For the Truth is in the Koran, as verified by the words of the prophet Muhammad, that the decisive battle will be in Jerusalem and its environs: 'The resurrection of the dead will not occur until you make war on the Jews...'\n The battle with the Jews will surely come... the decisive Muslim victory is coming without a doubt, and the prophet spoke about in more than one Hadith and the Day of Resurrection will not come without the victory of the believers [the Muslims] over the descendents of the monkeys and pigs [the Jews] and with their annihilation. 4\n \n Oh Allah, accept our martyrs in the highest heavens...\n Oh Allah, show the Jews a black day...\n Oh Allah, annihilate the Jews and their supporters...\n Oh Allah, raise the flag of Jihad across the land...5\n \n Thus, as the world is eagerly awaiting and believing for the peaceful co-existence of the Jewish and the Palestinian people, the Imams, the religious authorities of the Palestinian people, with the full support and approval of the political leadership are ceaselessly beating the drums of \"the final war,\" the final slaughter of the Jews.\n \n Satan's Ancient Hatred For The Jews\n \n When we compare the spirit that we see in Islam with the spirit that we see manifest under the rule of the Antichrist and the False Prophet, it is the same ancient hatred against the Jewish people in both. It is an ancient hatred that originates with Satan himself. From the day that God Himself showed His favor to the Jewish people, Satan has likewise raged against them. Satan's primary vehicles that he has used to do this have been several great world empires. These are the \"beast\" empires that we discussed in chapter ten. Throughout history, we can observe Satan's attempts to exterminate or persecute the Jewish people:\n \n 1. Through Pharaoh, the ruler of Egypt, when he ordered the slaughter of every male Hebrew child. (Exodus 1:5-22)\n \n 2. Through Shalmaneser, the ruler of Assyria, when he conquered the northern kingdom of Israel and carried away and dispersed ten of the twelve tribes into exile. (2 Kings 17:5,6)\n \n 3. Through Nebuchadnezzar, the ruler of Babylon, when he attacked Jerusalem, the capital of the southern Kingdom of Judea, and carried the rest of the Jews off into exile. (2 Kings 24:10-16)\n \n 4. Through Haman, the man appointed as second in command over the Medo/Persian Empire, when he attempted to have every Jew in the empire killed. (Esther 3:9)\n \n 5. Through Antiochus Epiphanes, the Greek ruler of Syria, when he laid siege to Jerusalem in what the Jewish Historian Josephus describes as one of the bloodiest sieges in Israel's history. (Daniel 8:23-25; 1 Maccabees 1-6) 6 \n \n 6. Through Titus, the Roman emperor, who attacked and captured Jerusalem, killing over 1.1 million Jews, and enslaving over 97,000. (Wars of the Jews, VI, ix, 3).\n \n 7. Through various Islamic and Christian empires, which we cannot fail to mention. Even Christianity (albeit in a perverted form) has been far from innocent in the bloody history of the Jewish people.\n \n 8. Through Adolf Hitler, who killed over six million Jews during World War II.\n \n 9. And eventually through the Antichrist and the False Prophet and their future empire, which is prophesied very clearly by the Prophets Zechariah and Ezekiel to attack Jerusalem and kill two thirds of the inhabitants of the nation of Israel. (Zechariah 13:8,9; Ezekiel 38)\n \n Any thinking person at this point must stop and ask: What else can explain such a consistantly bloody and painful history of one people other than an inhuman demonic hatred? Who could instigate such a black and persistent attack against one people who represent such a very small fraction of one percent of the earth's population - no matter where they dwell? Who else if not the very Devil himself? The history of the Jewish people alone is proof to the open mind that Satan exists and that he hates those whom God loves and declares to be the very, \"apple of His eye.\" (Zecheriah 2:8). \n \n Conclusion\n \n Throughout natural history we see willing vessels manifest Satan's hatred for the Jewish people. And even more frightening, in the sacred texts of all three monotheistic religions, we see yet another future attack against the Jews, this one worse than all those that preceded it. In the Bible, it is specifically Satan's pawns, the Antichrist, his False Prophet and all who follow them who carry out the final onslaught. In Islam it is the Mahdi, the Muslim Jesus and as the tradition says, \"faithful Muslims\" who are the ones who carry out such atrocities. Indeed, in this regard, Islam again fulfills one of the primary characteristics of the Antichrist spirit; that of an unquenchable anti-Semitic spirit.\n \n Notes:\n \n 1.

   "Come on now, Daewoo. The reason that the Israeli army didn't wipe up Hezbollah is political, not military. Hezbollah hid amongst the civilians and every time Israel attacked a civilian area, they paid a political price. Israel went through Lebanon like a hot knife through butter last time. The only difference this time is that Hezbollah used guerilla tactics. They popped up, fired some missiles from civilian locations and then relocated. They didn't stand and fight. It was all hit and run.\n\n \n WRONG. Over 80% of hezbollahs troops were hiding in hezbollahs bunkers. That is why destroying the bunkers was so important. Hizbollah knows full well that Israel is in the same situation as the US. We have awesome air power and a #### poor ground capability, so they did the same thing Iran has done (or Iran did it for them :xbanghead ) and built bunkers that were not only storage or C&C areas, but fighting bases. They stage their troops int he bunkers, attack from the bunkers, then retreat into the bunkers. It neutralizes Israels air power and makes ground combat much more dangerous to israels ground troops because the way the bunkers are configured, they can pop troops in and out to hit the israelis where they are weakest. In order to counter that, the israelies would have to put a batallion in fron tof EVERY bunker entrance which would require FAR more than the 6 million people that make up the total population of Israel. \n \n \nDo you actually believe that Jews were \"afraid\" to engage in combat? \n Hezbollah arranged their bunkers among civilians knowing that if they were hit, civilians would die with them. To the credit of Jews, they did not want to kill the civilians. \n Hezbollah, understanding that in actual combat they stood a snowball's chance in hell made the best decision they could. Stay alive by involving the innocent because the weak caring west and the jews respect lives in general. so take advantage of their weakness.\n\n \n Do you do any research at all? There were exactly ZERO Hizbollah bunkers in civilian areas. I am not even going to try to guess what you are thinking of here. The Hezbollah bunkers were all located along the Israel/Lebanon border. Israel expended their entire stock of bunker busters and did not manage to destroy even one fo them. Then the US sent emergency shipments of our IMPROVED bunker busters and they expended ALL of those, and STILL did not manage to destroy even a single bunker. \n \n AFTER they blew al of their bunker busters to no effect but before the US sent them new ones they started bombing power stattions thinking that maybe that would shut down the bunker complexes. I guess that they didn't think that the Iranains knew what a backup generator was (unfortunatly it turns out that they knew full well and the bunkers were unaffected). Basically, israel tried to make a decisive strike against hezbollah, and instead it was a complete failure, so in depseration they started trying to take out secondary targets, which for whatever reason resulted in the bombing of a lot of power plants, factories, and aid convoys. \n \n Interestingly enough, these are the SAME bunker busters that americans who are completely ignorant when it comes to all thing military keep advocating bopping on over to Iran with to take out their nuclear program...which is mostly located in bunkers that are roughly 2-4X as hardened as the hezbollah bunkers were. It is amazing...it is almost like they specified \"not able to be destroyed by bunker busters\" in their construction specification.\n \n The israelis have outkilled the palestenians by over 1000 to one since the inception of the israeli state, so lets drop the \"respect for life\" ####.",

   "You people just prove that the truth is repugnent to you, and that your hatred goes way beyond righting Political wrongs when you can continue to defend the Palestinians in the face of evidence like this that you simply ignore when faced with it. If it conflicts with your preconcieved notions than just ignore it huh ? That's your version of truth isn't it. :xbanghead \n \n \nNobody has perfectly clean hands in any conflict but It has been my observation that Israel has sincerely reached out for peace and been rebuffed violently at every turn.\n \n \n \n Again I must disagree with you but here is an article that explains it better than I can.\n \n http://answering-islam.org.uk/Authors/JR/Future/ch13_islams_ancient_hatred.htm\n \n Chapter Thirteen\n \n Islam's Ancient Hatred For The Jews\n \n While Islam envisions the day when Christians and Jews will convert to Islam en masse, there is a distinction within Islam's end time narrative between the final destiny of Christians and that of the Jews. In Islam's version of the last-days, we see that all Christians will either accept Islam or be killed. Certainly, when we look at this final picture, it is impossible to say that Islam has any real affinity for Christians or Christianity. But when analyzing Islamic teaching and traditions about the Jews, one gets a very cold feeling that the only destiny that Islam has marked out for the Jews is that of an absolute and total slaughter. We see in the Islamic traditions a dark and very persistent hatred for the Jews nearly identical to the ideology expressed through Naziism. This ideology of hatred is fully supported and nurtured throughout the Quran and the Islamic traditions. For instance, speaking of Jews, the Quran says:\n \n Amongst them we (Allah) have placed enmity and hatred till the Day of Judgment. Every time they kindle the fire of war, Allah doth extinguish it; but they (ever) strive to do mischief on earth. And Allah loveth not those who do mischief. -Surah 5:64 (Yusuf Ali)\n \n This verse makes it clear that there will be \"enmity and hatred\" against the Jews until the very end of the present age. So much for those who claim that the Quran's scorn for Jews is limited only to specific historical incidences in Muhammad's career. Not only does the Quran portray Jews as those who start wars and cause general mischief in the earth, but it also literally claims that Allah was so disgusted by the Jews, that he cursed them and literally transformed many of them into \"apes and swine,\" assigning them the lowest \"rank\" among humankind:\n \n When in their insolence they transgressed (all) prohibitions, We said to them: \"Be ye apes, despised and rejected.\" -Surah 7:166 (Yususf Ali)\n \n Those who incurred the curse of Allah and His wrath, those of whom some He transformed into apes and swine, those who worshipped evil;- these are (many times) worse in rank, and far more astray from the even path! -Surah 5:60 (Yusuf Ali)\n \n And well ye knew those amongst you who transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath: We said to them: \"Be ye apes, despised and rejected.\" -Surah 2:65 (Yusuf Ali)\n \n Among the more anti-Semitic and vocal Muslims, these verses have become absolute favorites. Walid Shoebat is a former Muslim who grew up in the Palestinian territories. Recalling being taken on a school trip to the Jerusalem zoo as a child, Walid relates, \"The Islamic teacher would tell us, 'this gorilla was originally a Jew.' I look at this now and I think, this is what Naziism teaches - in its worst form. This is being taught throughout the entire Middle East.\"1 Just as the Nazis declared that Jews were subhuman \"vermin\" in order to justify their inhumane treatment of the Jews, so has the Muslim world followed the lead of the Quran in dehumanizing the Jewish race.\n \n Now, at this point, the enterprising Muslim apologist will be quick to argue that while there are many verses in the Quran that speak of the Jews in such a negative manner, there are also other verses that speak of the Jews in a positive manner as well. While this is true it is also highly misleading. In his highly informative book, Islam and the Jews, Mark A. Gabriel, Ph. D, a former Muslim Imam and Professor of Islamic history at the prestigious Al-Azhar University in Cairo, addresses this misunderstanding of Islam's disposition toward the Jews. Gabriel explains that according to Islamic theology, those verses in the Quran that appear to be \"nice\" towards the Jews are understood to be cancelled out (mansookh) by the verses that were revealed to Muhammad later in his \"prophetic\" career. This is based on the idea of progressive revelation in Islam whereby if you have any verses that seem to contradict one another, the newer revelations given to Muhammad negate or cancel out the older revelations. This is an established and well-understood doctrine in Islam called nasik. 2 Many Qurans even include a chart in the back that lists which verses are older and which are newer in order to know which verses are cancelled out and which verses remain. Because the verses which are inflammatory and aggressive toward the Jews are newer verses, they cancel out any that might have a more conciliatory tone. This understanding is well-known throughout the Islamic world.\n \n As we trace the growth and development of anti-Semitism in Islam, we see that unfortunately, it is not limited to the Quran, but rather seems to find an even fuller expression in the infamous Hadith about the final slaughter of the Jews. We have already quoted this tradition more than once, but shall quote it again here one last time:\n \n (Muhammad said:) The last hour would not come unless the Muslims will fight against the Jews and the Muslims would kill them until the Jews would hide themselves behind a stone or a tree and a stone or a tree would say: Muslim, or the servant of Allah, there is a Jew behind me; come and kill him; but the tree Gharqad would not say, for it is the tree of the Jews. (emphasis mine) 3\n \n This apocalyptic belief of a future battle against Israel and the murder of all Jews is a deeply held belief among many Muslims. And we must remember that these anti-Semitic traditions and verses from the Quran are over a thousand years old. These sacred Islamic traditions of a final slaughter of all Jews cannot be attributed to the present day conflict with the State of Israel. As much as many today try to blame Muslim enmity toward Jews solely on Zionism and its alleged \"Nazi-like\" abuse of the victimized and oppressed Palestinians, it simply cannot be done in an honest and informed manner. The enmity of Islam toward the Jews has existed since Islam's inception. It is not a new phenomenon. And today Islam and the Muslim world is undeniably the single most anti-Semitic force on the earth. Palestinians in particular, use the anti-Semitic apocalyptic template as a basis for much of their actions toward Israel and the Jews today. Although this template is in fact one of the primary factors fueling the ongoing present conflict in Israel, it is also the most often overlooked factor by secular observers who attempt to judge the present conflict on the basis of a moral equivalency. The following quotes are all translated portions of sermons from recent years, delivered by Sheikh Ibrahim Madhi, the officially appointed Imam of the Palestinian Authority. Notice the overwhelming reliance upon the previously discussed verses and traditions that are used to justify and support the hatred against the Jews:\n We the Palestinian nation, our fate from Allah is to be the vanguard in the war against the Jews until the resurrection of the dead, as the prophet Muhammad said: 'The resurrection of the dead will not arrive until you will fight the Jews and kill them... ' We the Palestinians are the vanguard in this undertaking and in this campaign, whether or not we want this...\n Oh, our Arab brethren... Oh, our Muslim brethren... Don't leave the Palestinians alone in the war against the Jews...even if it has been decreed upon us to be the vanguard... Jerusalem, Palestine and Al Aksa (The Temple Mount), the land that Allah blessed and its surrounding areas will remain at the center of the struggle between Truth and Falsehood, between the Jews and the non-Jews on this sacred land, regardless of how many agreements are signed, regardless of how many treaties and covenants are ratified. For the Truth is in the Koran, as verified by the words of the prophet Muhammad, that the decisive battle will be in Jerusalem and its environs: 'The resurrection of the dead will not occur until you make war on the Jews...'\n The battle with the Jews will surely come... the decisive Muslim victory is coming without a doubt, and the prophet spoke about in more than one Hadith and the Day of Resurrection will not come without the victory of the believers [the Muslims] over the descendents of the monkeys and pigs [the Jews] and with their annihilation. 4\n \n Oh Allah, accept our martyrs in the highest heavens...\n Oh Allah, show the Jews a black day...\n Oh Allah, annihilate the Jews and their supporters...\n Oh Allah, raise the flag of Jihad across the land...5\n \n Thus, as the world is eagerly awaiting and believing for the peaceful co-existence of the Jewish and the Palestinian people, the Imams, the religious authorities of the Palestinian people, with the full support and approval of the political leadership are ceaselessly beating the drums of \"the final war,\" the final slaughter of the Jews.\n \n Satan's Ancient Hatred For The Jews\n \n When we compare the spirit that we see in Islam with the spirit that we see manifest under the rule of the Antichrist and the False Prophet, it is the same ancient hatred against the Jewish people in both. It is an ancient hatred that originates with Satan himself. From the day that God Himself showed His favor to the Jewish people, Satan has likewise raged against them. Satan's primary vehicles that he has used to do this have been several great world empires. These are the \"beast\" empires that we discussed in chapter ten. Throughout history, we can observe Satan's attempts to exterminate or persecute the Jewish people:\n \n 1. Through Pharaoh, the ruler of Egypt, when he ordered the slaughter of every male Hebrew child. (Exodus 1:5-22)\n \n 2. Through Shalmaneser, the ruler of Assyria, when he conquered the northern kingdom of Israel and carried away and dispersed ten of the twelve tribes into exile. (2 Kings 17:5,6)\n \n 3. Through Nebuchadnezzar, the ruler of Babylon, when he attacked Jerusalem, the capital of the southern Kingdom of Judea, and carried the rest of the Jews off into exile. (2 Kings 24:10-16)\n \n 4. Through Haman, the man appointed as second in command over the Medo/Persian Empire, when he attempted to have every Jew in the empire killed. (Esther 3:9)\n \n 5. Through Antiochus Epiphanes, the Greek ruler of Syria, when he laid siege to Jerusalem in what the Jewish Historian Josephus describes as one of the bloodiest sieges in Israel's history. (Daniel 8:23-25; 1 Maccabees 1-6) 6 \n \n 6. Through Titus, the Roman emperor, who attacked and captured Jerusalem, killing over 1.1 million Jews, and enslaving over 97,000. (Wars of the Jews, VI, ix, 3).\n \n 7. Through various Islamic and Christian empires, which we cannot fail to mention. Even Christianity (albeit in a perverted form) has been far from innocent in the bloody history of the Jewish people.\n \n 8. Through Adolf Hitler, who killed over six million Jews during World War II.\n \n 9. And eventually through the Antichrist and the False Prophet and their future empire, which is prophesied very clearly by the Prophets Zechariah and Ezekiel to attack Jerusalem and kill two thirds of the inhabitants of the nation of Israel. (Zechariah 13:8,9; Ezekiel 38)\n \n Any thinking person at this point must stop and ask: What else can explain such a consistantly bloody and painful history of one people other than an inhuman demonic hatred? Who could instigate such a black and persistent attack against one people who represent such a very small fraction of one percent of the earth's population - no matter where they dwell? Who else if not the very Devil himself? The history of the Jewish people alone is proof to the open mind that Satan exists and that he hates those whom God loves and declares to be the very, \"apple of His eye.\" (Zecheriah 2:8). \n \n Conclusion\n \n Throughout natural history we see willing vessels manifest Satan's hatred for the Jewish people. And even more frightening, in the sacred texts of all three monotheistic religions, we see yet another future attack against the Jews, this one worse than all those that preceded it. In the Bible, it is specifically Satan's pawns, the Antichrist, his False Prophet and all who follow them who carry out the final onslaught. In Islam it is the Mahdi, the Muslim Jesus and as the tradition says, \"faithful Muslims\" who are the ones who carry out such atrocities. Indeed, in this regard, Islam again fulfills one of the primary characteristics of the Antichrist spirit; that of an unquenchable anti-Semitic spirit.\n \n Notes:\n \n 1.

They're guerrillas.They're very smart\"\n \n Michael Sidorenko, an Israeli soldier fighting in south Lebanon\n \n For the past few days, Israel has been fighting for control of the tiny southern Lebanese village of Maroun al-Ras, located on a hilltop less than 500 metres across the border. \n \n The army said it had taken the village, but gunfire and the blasts of artillery shells could still be heard on Sunday as tanks and helicopters pounded positions inside.\n Officers at the scene confirmed there was still fighting to do.\n \n \"They're not fighting like we thought they would,\" one soldier said. \"They're fighting harder. They're good on their own ground.\"\n \n One soldier said the guerrillas wore olive green army uniforms \"to confuse us\" because Israelis wear the same. \n \n Others said Hezbollah hid underground in reinforced bunkers until they thought it safe to come out and attack. \n \n The Israeli troops prefer to stay away from those bunkers, the soldiers said, instead calling in coordinates so forces massed behind the border can hit them with guided missiles.\n \n \"It will take the summer to beat them,\" said Michael Sidorenko, 21, resting in the shade of a road sign with other combat troops. On the hills behind him, loud gunfire and the constant thud of explosions could be heard.\n \n \"They're not normal soldiers, you know,\" Sidorenko said. \"They're guerrillas. They're very smart.\"\n \n Sidorenko said he saw Hezbollah fighters firing from behind Lebanese civilians.\n \n \"That's why our soldiers are getting killed,\" he said.\n Of the 19 soldiers killed so far since fighting began, five have died trying to gain control of Maroun al-Ras.\n \n To avoid more deaths among its troops, Israel has decided to limit its ground incursions to pinpoint operations near the border. \n \n Tactical shortcomings\n \n But military analysts say this tactic may well be insufficient to achieve Israel's goal of pushing Hezbollah back and destroying its ability to attack Israel.\n \n Not every soldier described Hezbollah as fierce. One said that when Israeli troops show up in vehicles, the guerrillas \"run like chickens.\"\n \n Others wondered why Hezbollah had not yet attacked the nearly two-dozen army vehicles and hundreds of troops camped out in easy striking range below the hill on which Maroun al-Ras sits.\n \n Most believed the guerrillas would rather keep aiming their rockets at major Israeli population centres such as Haifa. Eighteen civilians have died in such attacks on northern Israel.would. \n \n The soldiers said Hezbollah had refrained from attacking them as they approached Maroun al-Ras in tanks and armoured personnel carriers, preferring instead to let troops reach the village and attack them there. \n The fighting, they said, showed the guerrillas had used the six years since Israel withdrew from Lebanon to build bunkers, stockpile weapons and study tactics.\n \n \"They have good knowledge about where we are, what we're doing, what kinds of weapons we have,\" Sidorenko said.\n \n \"But it's better to fight them now than later, when they'd be even stronger.\" \n \n Source: AP \n http://english.aljazeera.net/English/archive/archive?ArchiveId=24673\n \n\n \n \n\n How do they operate?\n \n Hezbollah have perfected the tactic of hit and run which makes it very hard for the Israelis, using traditional warfare techniques, to target them. They work in groups of five to six \"elements\" and each group is totally independent from the next group. Each has a general set of directives and most make their \"plan d'action\" as they go. This way, they are able to operate in the event of total loss of communication with the commanding base and there is no risk of anyone eavesdropping on conversations. And should anyone fall prisoner in the hands of the Israelis, he can only give out the plans of his group.\n \n Each group travels using Cross bikes...this gives them flexibility as well as manageability on the terrain. Armed with light assault rifles and submachine guns and state of the art Chinese anti tank grenade propellers supplied by Iran, they are able to inflict severe damage to the opponent whilst sustaining minimal damage.\n \n An example of how they operate can be given by the way they fire missiles, three bikes are used to perform the action:\n \n One person stays at a distance providing surveillance and looking out for apache helicopters or spy planes \n One group, on a bike, set up the launcher platform, without the missile. Total time: 5 seconds and they drive off. \n One group delivers the missile and leaves. Total time 3 seconds. \n One group sets the missile, fires it and leaves. Total time 10 to 20 seconds. \n The first group comes back to collect the launch pad, if the observer informs them that all is clear, and replaces it in a subterranean hideout, to be used in the next operation. \n All the groups leave in totally different directions.\n \n The bikes are also used to lure the tanks into ambushes set up for them by fighters hiding in tunnels. The same tunnels are used to move between villages undetected and be able to surprise the enemy which relies on aerial images of the fight zone.\n \n This fighting technique has caused great damage to the Israelis in their advance in South Lebanon.\n \n It was observed that the only way the Israelis can counter it is by applying the charred land approach whereby any incursion should be preceded by heavy bombardment of the region by fighter planes, followed by a fine combing using heavy machine guns and helicopters before the infantry troops finally walk in.\n \n Since the guerilla fighters hide between civilians, and operate from within inhabited or industrial areas, they greatly benefit from the coverage and lure IAF planes into bombarding civilians and factories which allows the Hezb to use the media coverage to its benefit.\n \n Israel has had to resort to expelling all the inhabitants of the region out of the area and even beyond the traditional headquarters of Hezbollah namely southern suburbs of Beirut so as to minimize civilian causalities as well as any supportive action the Party of God can benefit from.\n \n http://www.ouwet.com/othello/other/hezbollah-fighting-techniques-and-tactics/\n \n\n \n \n\n Whose War Crimes? \n Evidence from Lebanon about how terrorists use civilians. \n \n Monday, December 11, 2006 12:01 a.m. EST \n \n A few scenes from modern warfare: \n \n Mohammad Abd al-Hamid Srour moved missiles across southern Lebanon under cover of a white flag. Hussein Ali Mahmoud Suleiman used the porch of a private home to fire rockets. Maher Hassan Mahmoud Kourani dressed in civilian clothes, hid his Kalashnikov in a tote bag and stored anti-aircraft missiles in the back of a green unmarked Volvo. The three men, all members of Hezbollah, were captured by Israel during last summer's war.\n \n Now their videotaped interviews form part of a remarkable report by retired Lieutenant Colonel Reuven Erlich of Israel's Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center. Relying heavily on captured Hezbollah documents, onsite and aerial photography and other first-hand evidence, the report shows how the Shiite group put innocent civilians at risk by deliberately deploying its forces in cities, towns and often private homes. \n \n Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch, has accused Israel's military of \"indiscriminate warfare\" and \"a disturbing disregard for the lives of Lebanese civilians.\" Mr. Erlich demolishes that claim, and in the process shows the asymmetric strategy of Islamist radicals. \n \n The most persuasive evidence here is photographic, so we urge readers to access the report itself on the Web site of the American Jewish Congress (ajcongress.org). Hezbollah's headquarters in Aita al-Shaab, for instance, sits in the heart of the village. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah's office and home are in a densely built neighborhood of Beirut. In the town of Qana--site of an Israeli bombing on July 30 that killed 28 and that Hezbollah's apologists were quick to label a \"massacre\"--an arms warehouse can be seen adjacent to a mosque. There are photographs of rockets in the back seats of cars, missile launchers adjacent to farm houses, storage bunkers hidden beneath homes. There is also a trove of before-and-after photography demonstrating the precision of most Israeli bombing.\n The report also shows how the use of civilian cover was explicitly part of Hezbollah's strategy. \"[The organization's operatives] live in their houses, in their schools, in their churches, in their fields, in their farms and in their factories,\" said Mr. Nasrallah in a TV interview on May 27, several weeks before the war. \"You can't destroy them in the same way you would destroy an army.\"\n Exactly what Mr. Nasrallah means is illustrated in the testimonials of the captured fighters. Asked why Hezbollah would risk the destruction of civilian areas by firing from them, Mr. Suleiman replied that while in theory private homes belonged to \"the residents of the village . . . in essence they belong to Hezbollah.\"\n Perhaps that's true; if so, then Human Rights Watch has no grounds to accuse Israel of atrocities when Mr. Nasrallah has effectively declared everyone and everything in southern Lebanon to be his fief. Our sense, however, is that not all southern Lebanese were delighted to have their livelihoods appropriated for Hezbollah's political purposes, even if they were too intimidated to register a protest. Either way, it is Hezbollah, not Israel, that is guilty of war crimes here.\n \n http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110009371\n \n\n \n I'd say that all of the above supports our assertions that Hezbollah fought a guerilla war and used the civilian population for cover in the classic style of Islamic terrorists.",

It still makes the older set sit up and take notice, but the younger generations jsut don't seem to care. It is something a bunch of dead Germans did. They don't seem to understand why we should be paying for it, or why we shoudl cut Israel any slack because of it.\n\n \n I don't deny that the mention of that word: Holocaust produces an automatic response (pity and maybe even guilt) in many of us. Not to defend Israel seems akin to not doing nothing against another impending Holocaust.\n This is logical since Hezbollah and most Palestinians maintain that their goal is the destruction of Israel. However we must make a distinction between Israel (a political entity) and Jews.\n Hezbollah do not want the Jews to be killed, it only wants the restoration of Palestine to the Palestine people.\n Similarly in WWII liberation of German occupied territories did not mean the extermination of all Germans.",

And they were there when the attack started. They have told me first hand about the human shields and the taking over of civilian homes by the hezbollah fighters. I'm not propagating propaganda here but eye witness accounts by those who were there. My cousins friend and his family was ushered out of harms way by Israeli soldiers as Hezbollah terrorists were trying to create more victims to blame on the Jews.\n \n You have no concept about how the arab mind works at all. Their attitude is if they kill faithful moslems while in the process of killing so called infidels, they believe they are just sending those good moslems home to paradise as martyrs. THEY DON'T HAVE ONE IOTA OF RESPECT FOR ANY HUMAN LIFE AT ALL. TO THEM IT'S JUST A MATTER OF SENDING THEM TO HEAVEN OR HELL. THAT IS THE DOCTRINE OF HATE THAT ISLAM TEACHES AND PRACTICES.

   "\n 1. Do you do any research at all? There were exactly ZERO Hizbollah bunkers in civilian areas. I am not even going to try to guess what you are thinking of here. The Hezbollah bunkers were all located along the Israel/Lebanon border. Israel expended their entire stock of bunker busters and did not manage to destroy even one fo them. Then the US sent emergency shipments of our IMPROVED bunker busters and they expended ALL of those, and STILL did not manage to destroy even a single bunker. \n \n Interestingly enough, these are the SAME bunker busters that americans who are completely ignorant when it comes to all thing military keep advocating bopping on over to Iran with to take out their nuclear program...which is mostly located in bunkers that are roughly 2-4X as hardened as the hezbollah bunkers were. It is amazing...it is almost like they specified \"not able to be destroyed by bunker busters\" in their construction specification.\n \n 2. The israelis have outkilled the palestenians by over 1000 to one since the inception of the israeli state, so lets drop the \"respect for life\" ####.\n\n \n 1. I do no research. I catch the news on occasion. If I did do research, I would not be using anti-American and Jew sources. Your constant attacks on anything American disqualifies your opinions for me. Your incessant personal attacks on people who oppose in the slightest your anti-American rants exposes you as pompus and suffering from napolean syndrome (little man). \n You and other anti-Americans continually blame America for every problem in the world and give people who would glady \"saw\" your head off a pass. As though they walk on some moral high ground. They don't. \n 2. Killing more of the enemy than they kill of you is called winning and it is the only reason that Israel still exist. \n Hezbollah started launching Kitusha rockets into Israel for the express purpose of killing Jews. Any Jew. The Jew soldiers may well have struggled and failed to kill the launch sites. But, because of success of someone, Hezbollah was not able to invade and destroy Israel. Which surely was their goal. Why else would you blindly launch rockets into a country? The fact that Hezbollah started a conflict and the only incursion that occurred was that of Jews entering Lebanon suggest that Jews seem to be able to conduct a ground war successfully. Political reasons played a part in not pursuing them and destroying them. Contrary to your suggestion that Jews can't fight a ground battle. What a joke. Even if it were true, and the means of winning came from the air alone, good. Winning is winning regardless of how it is accomplished. Kill more of the enemy than they can kill.",

Hopefully they are not being detained within range of kitusha rockets. \n Killing soldiers in the act of kidnapping surviving soldiers is always an act of war. In the process of planning such an action, one might consider the consequences. Anytime a race of people has a sworn to, unwavering goal of the destruction of your nation and your people, you kill as many of them as possible when they kill and kidnap your people. Or?

And can you prove our invasion of Iraq was illegal with anything other than innuendo and propaganda ? In fact here's your champions speech as she voted in favor of the Iraq invasion. Notice how she refers way back to 98 when regime change was determined to be necessary by her husband, your beloved President Clinton. I post this speech only because it defines so succinctly the valid and legal reasons for going to War to dethrone Saddam Hussein. Note the bolded and italicized.\n \n October 10, 2002\n \n Floor Speech of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton\n on S.J. Res. 45, A Resolution to Authorize the Use of\n United States Armed Forces Against Iraq\n \n As Delivered\n \n Today we are asked whether to give the President of the United States authority to use force in Iraq should diplomatic efforts fail to dismantle Saddam Hussein's chemical and biological weapons and his nuclear program.\n \n I am honored to represent nearly 19 million New Yorkers, a thoughtful democracy of voices and opinions who make themselves heard on the great issues of our day especially this one. Many have contacted my office about this resolution, both in support of and in opposition to it, and I am grateful to all who have expressed an opinion.\n \n I also greatly respect the differing opinions within this body. The debate they engender will aid our search for a wise, effective policy. Therefore, on no account should dissent be discouraged or disparaged. It is central to our freedom and to our progress, for on more than one occasion, history has proven our great dissenters to be right.\n \n Now, I believe the facts that have brought us to this fateful vote are not in doubt. Saddam Hussein is a tyrant who has tortured and killed his own people, even his own family members, to maintain his iron grip on power. He used chemical weapons on Iraqi Kurds and on Iranians, killing over 20 thousand people. Unfortunately, during the 1980's, while he engaged in such horrific activity, he enjoyed the support of the American government, because he had oil and was seen as a counterweight to the Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran.\n \n In 1991, Saddam Hussein invaded and occupied Kuwait, losing the support of the United States. The first President Bush assembled a global coalition, including many Arab states, and threw Saddam out after forty-three days of bombing and a hundred hours of ground operations. The U.S.-led coalition then withdrew, leaving the Kurds and the Shiites, who had risen against Saddam Hussein at our urging, to Saddam's revenge.\n \n As a condition for ending the conflict, the United Nations imposed a number of requirements on Iraq, among them disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction, stocks used to make such weapons, and laboratories necessary to do the work. Saddam Hussein agreed, and an inspection system was set up to ensure compliance. And though he repeatedly lied, delayed, and obstructed the inspections work, the inspectors found and destroyed far more weapons of mass destruction capability than were destroyed in the Gulf War, including thousands of chemical weapons, large volumes of chemical and biological stocks, a number of missiles and warheads, a major lab equipped to produce anthrax and other bio-weapons, as well as substantial nuclear facilities.\n \n In 1998, Saddam Hussein pressured the United Nations to lift the sanctions by threatening to stop all cooperation with the inspectors. In an attempt to resolve the situation, the UN, unwisely in my view, agreed to put limits on inspections of designated \"sovereign sites\" including the so-called presidential palaces, which in reality were huge compounds well suited to hold weapons labs, stocks, and records which Saddam Hussein was required by UN resolution to turn over. When Saddam blocked the inspection process, the inspectors left. As a result, President Clinton, with the British and others, ordered an intensive four-day air assault, Operation Desert Fox, on known and suspected weapons of mass destruction sites and other military targets.\n \n In 1998, the United States also changed its underlying policy toward Iraq from containment to regime change and began to examine options to effect such a change, including support for Iraqi opposition leaders within the country and abroad.\n \n In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including Al Qaeda members, though there is apparently no evidence of his involvement in the terrible events of September 11, 2001.\n \n It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons. Should he succeed in that endeavor, he could alter the political and security landscape of the Middle East, which as we know all too well affects American security.\n \n Now this much is undisputed. The open questions are: what should we do about it? How, when, and with whom?\n \n Some people favor attacking Saddam Hussein now, with any allies we can muster, in the belief that one more round of weapons inspections would not produce the required disarmament, and that deposing Saddam would be a positive good for the Iraqi people and would create the possibility of a secular democratic state in the Middle East, one which could perhaps move the entire region toward democratic reform.\n \n This view has appeal to some, because it would assure disarmament; because it would right old wrongs after our abandonment of the Shiites and Kurds in 1991, and our support for Saddam Hussein in the 1980's when he was using chemical weapons and terrorizing his people; and because it would give the Iraqi people a chance to build a future in freedom.\n \n However, this course is fraught with danger. We and our NATO allies did not depose Mr. Milosevic, who was responsible for more than a quarter of a million people being killed in the 1990s. Instead, by stopping his aggression in Bosnia and Kosovo, and keeping on the tough sanctions, we created the conditions in which his own people threw him out and led to his being in the dock being tried for war crimes as we speak.\n \n If we were to attack Iraq now, alone or with few allies, it would set a precedent that could come back to haunt us. In recent days, Russia has talked of an invasion of Georgia to attack Chechen rebels. India has mentioned the possibility of a pre-emptive strike on Pakistan. And what if China were to perceive a threat from Taiwan?\n \n So Mr. President, for all its appeal, a unilateral attack, while it cannot be ruled out, on the present facts is not a good option.\n \n Others argue that we should work through the United Nations and should only resort to force if and when the United Nations Security Council approves it. This too has great appeal for different reasons. The UN deserves our support. Whenever possible we should work through it and strengthen it, for it enables the world to share the risks and burdens of global security and when it acts, it confers a legitimacy that increases the likelihood of long-term success. The UN can help lead the world into a new era of global cooperation and the United States should support that goal.\n \n But there are problems with this approach as well. The United Nations is an organization that is still growing and maturing. It often lacks the cohesion to enforce its own mandates. And when Security Council members use the veto, on occasion, for reasons of narrow-minded interests, it cannot act. In Kosovo, the Russians did not approve NATO military action because of political, ethnic, and religious ties to the Serbs. The United States therefore could not obtain a Security Council resolution in favor of the action necessary to stop the dislocation and ethnic cleansing of more than a million Kosovar Albanians. However, most of the world was with us because there was a genuine emergency with thousands dead and a million driven from their homes. As soon as the American-led conflict was over, Russia joined the peacekeeping effort that is still underway.\n \n In the case of Iraq, recent comments indicate that one or two Security Council members might never approve force against Saddam Hussein until he has actually used chemical, biological, or God forbid, nuclear weapons.\n \n So, Mr. President, the question is how do we do our best to both defuse the real threat that Saddam Hussein poses to his people, to the region, including Israel, to the United States, to the world, and at the same time, work to maximize our international support and strengthen the United Nations?\n \n While there is no perfect approach to this thorny dilemma, and while people of good faith and high intelligence can reach diametrically opposed conclusions, I believe the best course is to go to the UN for a strong resolution that scraps the 1998 restrictions on inspections and calls for complete, unlimited inspections with cooperation expected and demanded from Iraq. I know that the Administration wants more, including an explicit authorization to use force, but we may not be able to secure that now, perhaps even later. But if we get a clear requirement for unfettered inspections, I believe the authority to use force to enforce that mandate is inherent in the original 1991 UN resolution, as President Clinton recognized when he launched Operation Desert Fox in 1998.\n \n If we get the resolution that President Bush seeks, and if Saddam complies, disarmament can proceed and the threat can be eliminated. Regime change will, of course, take longer but we must still work for it, nurturing all reasonable forces of opposition.\n \n If we get the resolution and Saddam does not comply, then we can attack him with far more support and legitimacy than we would have otherwise.\n \n If we try and fail to get a resolution that simply, but forcefully, calls for Saddam's compliance with unlimited inspections, those who oppose even that will be in an indefensible position. And, we will still have more support and legitimacy than if we insist now on a resolution that includes authorizing military action and other requirements giving some nations superficially legitimate reasons to oppose any Security Council action. They will say we never wanted a resolution at all and that we only support the United Nations when it does exactly what we want.\n \n I believe international support and legitimacy are crucial. After shots are fired and bombs are dropped, not all consequences are predictable. While the military outcome is not in doubt, should we put troops on the ground, there is still the matter of Saddam Hussein's biological and chemical weapons. Today he has maximum incentive not to use them or give them away. If he did either, the world would demand his immediate removal. Once the battle is joined, however, with the outcome certain, he will have maximum incentive to use weapons of mass destruction and to give what he can't use to terrorists who can torment us with them long after he is gone. We cannot be paralyzed by this possibility, but we would be foolish to ignore it. And according to recent reports, the CIA agrees with this analysis. A world united in sharing the risk at least would make this occurrence less likely and more bearable and would be far more likely to share with us the considerable burden of rebuilding a secure and peaceful post-Saddam Iraq.\n \n President Bush's speech in Cincinnati and the changes in policy that have come forth since the Administration began broaching this issue some weeks ago have made my vote easier. Even though the resolution before the Senate is not as strong as I would like in requiring the diplomatic route first and placing highest priority on a simple, clear requirement for unlimited inspections, I will take the President at his word that he will try hard to pass a UN resolution and will seek to avoid war, if at all possible.\n \n Because bipartisan support for this resolution makes success in the United Nations more likely, and therefore, war less likely, and because a good faith effort by the United States, even if it fails, will bring more allies and legitimacy to our cause, I have concluded, after careful and serious consideration, that a vote for the resolution best serves the security of our nation. If we were to defeat this resolution or pass it with only a few Democrats, I am concerned that those who want to pretend this problem will go way with delay will oppose any UN resolution calling for unrestricted inspections.\n \n This is a very difficult vote. This is probably the hardest decision I have ever had to make -- any vote that may lead to war should be hard -- but I cast it with conviction.\n \n And perhaps my decision is influenced by my eight years of experience on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue in the White House watching my husband deal with serious challenges to our nation. I want this President, or any future President, to be in the strongest possible position to lead our country in the United Nations or in war. Secondly, I want to insure that Saddam Hussein makes no mistake about our national unity and for our support for the President's efforts to wage America's war against terrorists and weapons of mass destruction. And thirdly, I want the men and women in our Armed Forces to know that if they should be called upon to act against Iraq, our country will stand resolutely behind them.\n \n My vote is not, however, a vote for any new doctrine of pre-emption, or for uni-lateralism, or for the arrogance of American power or purpose -- all of which carry grave dangers for our nation, for the rule of international law and for the peace and security of people throughout the world.\n \n Over eleven years have passed since the UN called on Saddam Hussein to rid himself of weapons of mass destruction as a condition of returning to the world community. Time and time again he has frustrated and denied these conditions. This matter cannot be left hanging forever with consequences we would all live to regret. War can yet be avoided, but our responsibility to global security and to the integrity of United Nations resolutions protecting it cannot. I urge the President to spare no effort to secure a clear, unambiguous demand by the United Nations for unlimited inspections.\n \n And finally, on another personal note, I come to this decision from the perspective of a Senator from New York who has seen all too closely the consequences of last year's terrible attacks on our nation. In balancing the risks of action versus inaction, I think New Yorkers who have gone through the fires of hell may be more attuned to the risk of not acting. I know that I am.\n \n So it is with conviction that I support this resolution as being in the best interests of our nation. A vote for it is not a vote to rush to war; it is a vote that puts awesome responsibility in the hands of our President and we say to him - use these powers wisely and as a last resort. And it is a vote that says clearly to Saddam Hussein - this is your last chance - disarm or be disarmed.\n \n Thank you, Mr. President.\n \n \n SO ONCE AGAIN, PROVE YOUR RIDICULOUS ASSERTION THAT THIS WAR WAS ILLEGAL AND THAT BUSH IS A CRIMINAL.",

Apparently from what I hear Iran was hijacking Iraqi civilian commercial planes like no body's business and the US actually had a role in giving the Iraqis the plane to train anti-Iranian hijackers. Furthermore, you don't need a actual plane to plan a hijacking. Any training in enclosed spaces will do. Plus it makes you less of a target. Why would you train terrorists in a easily spotted, easily destroyed location? That's just SILLY. Furthermore Saddam had a long standing policy towards putting targets in civilian areas. Knowing that we'd be roaring to blow up a terrorist camp, he'd put it in a highly dense civilian area to video tape us blowing away some civilians when we hit the training camp. The area stated that had the 747 was south of Baghdad in essentially a deserted place. That goes against Saddam's long standing policy of using collateral damage to bash the US. It just doesn't make sense looking at how Saddam placed targets he'd knew we would want to him. That would be like the Soviets changing their long held procedures over night. That does not happen. This is all about organizational theory. Organizations tend to have a rigid method of operation. Military and dictatorships tend to have almost absolute methods of operations. Figure it out and you can essentially predict their next moves. Guess how we found where Soviet Silos were in the cold war? By looking for specific types of wide turns around large fenced in areas. \n \n \nIf you dont care or don't have enough time to look up the link just tell me the name of the paper or on line news service you read this at. You should know better. Arch is giving you links and sources and this is the best you can do? Come on.\n\n \n Arch's sources leave much to be desired, specifically the things he said they say. PM Daewoo. He probably has it. \n \n I gotta say though, obvious seems to be right on a minor point, Arch. Your article didn't explicity say that Atta trained at the exact same place as the 747 hulk. However, this is a minor detail. As it said in the article:\n \n \nObvious, you should consider judging people not just by what they say, but by what they DO.\n\n \n Yeah, funding militants to kill Saddam is pretty much a \"I don't like you\" kind of statement don't you think? Volunteering to defend Saudi Arabia against Saddam is pretty much a statement of \"I don't like you.\" \n \n \nThere may be more dynamics and variables going on which connect sadam and al queda than just their say so.\n\n \n Yeah. When one group tries to assassinate and overthrow another, that's kind of a clear sign they aren't chummy friends. When Saddam tried to assassinate Bush Sr he obviously didn't like him. Likewise when Bin Laden ordered and funded groups to assassinate Saddam, he didn't like him.\n \n \nIn view of the wieght of this evidence, I gotta say I'm more convinced of Archangels point of view.\n\n \n Arch lives in lala land. \n \n \nObvious, you're nit-picking. You need to do some research. Take your time.\n\n \n Nit picking? What else is there to say when Bin Laden funds groups to overthrow and kill Saddam? Do your friends try to kill you \n \n \nThis isn't a fist fight. No one loses.\n\n \n I don't expect arch to reply to me. He doesn't like me. I blew rather large holes in his theological framework. \n \n \nKinda given up on the Sadam-Al Queda connection until now. Might re examine it in light of this new evidence.\n\n \n Perhaps. There's more truth in the connection then there was in WMD.",

South Africa had nuclear weapons. Since they had them in the past, they must therefore have them now, according you asinine logic. Furthermore, as the US has controlled Iraq for over 3 years and had access to everything from physical locations, people, and paper trails why is that we have yet to find any working programs, people involved in such programs or paper trails of such programs? \n \n \nThat is undeniable.\n\n \n It is also massively simplistic ignoring everything important and setting a standard that once someone does or has something they will always have or do something regardless of the actual evidence. \n \n \nHe also used chemical weapons against Iran in his 8 year long War with her, That too is undeniable.\n\n \n A war the US backed both sides. And that war ended over 20 years ago. Taiwan had a nuclear weapons program. I guess they do now since if someone did something in the past, they therefore will do it always in future. South Korea was illegally researching nuclear weapons technology in clear violation of the NPT. Your logic states they are doing it now despite IAEA evidence they are not. Furthermore of the chemical weapons found virtually all of them consisted of degraded Iran-Iraq shells. This would therefore show that the remaining chemicals that were weaponized and still around came from a period prior to Desert Shield. \n \n \nIsn't it the epitome of deceit and denial that the Left insists that Bush lied when every Intelligence agency in the World knew and accepted that Iraq had a working WMD Program, including nuclear?\n\n \n Now that is a outright lie. The Chezks who passed on the primary information for Bush's campagin was from a source they didn't believe was credible. Furthermore, they TOLD the CIA that the source, Curveball was not credible. On top of that, the CIA told the Bush adminstration that they did not believe Iraq had wmd. On TOP OF THAT the Bush adminstration created a specific branch of its power within the pentagon and CIA to force intelligence and analysts to give information that would support their claims. Of all of the white papers and NIEs given they all stress the least likely, most damaging possibility, rather then the most likely which happened to be no WMD.\n \n You are very uninformed. \n \n \nAnd how can they not see how they are defeating themselves and playing right into the hands of our enemies propaganda by now accepting that the weapons never existed rather than the actual truth that they were moved to a friendly Country that aided saddam in hiding them until we came and then left after the invasion?\n\n \n Too bad that's a lie. Where's the evidence by US satellites of a massive convoy of trucks to Syria? Furthermore where is the evidence of a working weapons program? Without a program, Iraq could not have produced anything to ship. Now in the manufacturing industry one must make something to ship it. As WMD fall within that, lacking the ability of manufacturing results in not being able to ship anything. The real enemy is ourselves in overblowing the threat and financially ruining our future economy by sucking out funds for healthcare, R&D and education to fight a enemy that's threat is far overblown. \n \n \nI marvel at the Lefts ability to deny the facts in favor of convenient lies that serve their agenda of appeasement.\n\n \n I marvel at the Neo-con's ability to deny the facts and call everyone, even hardcore conservatives leftsists because they disagree.\n \n It's great that I'm on your ignore list as you won't post a feeble reply.",

   "Hello! Watching the reports of the Boeing 777 crash at Heathrow last week, I couldn't reject a thought that this must be a terrorist act. Indeed, this bird had quite flown all the way from Beijing fault free, until the last 45 seconds of the final when it suffered not just 1 but 2 engine failures, an event which is a pilot's worst nightmare, but also stands as much chance of happening as Santa winning the lottery. As you know, the powered aircraft lost all power and avionics, and became glider at 500 feet... Not nice. Not nice at all. That's only thanks to very good work from the pilot that everybody got out alive which is really a miracle. For 100 per cent that has nothing to do with no \"pilot error\". Than what? I say, that was an unsuccessful terrorist attampt or rather intimidation by some Islamic terrorist group (presumably al-Qaida), which might be their reaction to an improvident statement by certain top-ranking official of British security services who said that al-Qaida plays terrorism propaganda on Internet - that is intimidations of assasinations and terrorist acts, announcement of opening permanent representation of al-Qaida in London, etc. I say that British intelligence services respond inadequately to real terrorist threat of such terrorist networks like al-Qaida. In my estimation, that's result of increasing inability of British secret services to meet changes as they get involved by British government into fulfilling their own political tasks such as confrontation with Russia. Too bad for Britain as such and Brits in general. Their security nowadays is far beneath the mark.",
