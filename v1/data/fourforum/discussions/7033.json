There is no proof that it scares off potential murderers in society, and no other argument even makes sense. I posted a similar argument on a thread earlier, but decided it needs its own.\n \n People always talk about how \"We need to think of John (the murdered), and have them put to death for John's sake.\" The dead don't seek revenge, and revenge can be nothing but meaningless to a person who is dead. Unless, of course, you can prove that revenge does have meaning for the dead, in which case our justice system might have reason to consider it. What these people are really doing is using the dead's name in order to get their own personal revenge. Anyone who uses the dead's name like this is defaming them, and this is absolutely wrong. If you want revenge, ask for it in your own name; don't be a coward. But, if you weren't the one murdered, what right do you have to ask for revenge in your own name? You don't. The only reason you have a right to ask for punishment at all is in the name of protecting society. We punish to ensure future safety by staving off future wrongdoings (again, the death penalty is no more effective than eternity in prison).\n \n From the American people's perspective, what is just about spending more of their money putting a man to death than they would by simply removing him from society for the rest of his life? Both accomplish the same goal of total removal. If it has ever happened that a man convicted of murder was legally released, and killed yet again, one (or even a few) incident is laughable in the face of the number of innocent people put on death row. \n \n The argument that convicted murderers might break free is also a joke. Justice is not put to use by acting under the assumption that its dictates will not be followed through. Similarly, we could assume anything about anyone we ever punished at all. Were I a teacher, I could assume that the child I sent to the corner was going to leave early, and thus escort him straight to the principle's office, just to be prudent. Such reasoning allows virtually any punishment to be extended ad infinitum because the punished might fall out of line with their punishment at any time.\n \n Then there is the argument that flaws in the death penalty lay with the judiciary system, not with the actual penalty itself. While anyone can accept that a \"perfect\" judiciary system would only send real murderers to death row, even if this were the case, it does not negate the problems mentioned before. The death penalty costs the tax payers more and benefits neither the dead, nor society, in any way, and society doesn't punish in order to \"get revenge.\" (In addition, this argument can be flipped and used against the argument that prisoners might escape: \"But that's a problem with prison security!\" Or against the inmate release argument: \"But that's a problem with releasing life-in-prison muderers, not with the punishment itself if it were properly used!\")\n \n But the worst part of it all is this \"machismo\" aura that many pro-death penalty citizens try to emulate. \"They killed so and so, therefore stick it to 'em and let 'em burn!

A perfect judiciary system would not sentence innocent people, and would alleviate all problems with the death penalty. If we had a perfect system and no innocent person was ever sent to death row, we could take them directy from sentencing to a little room beside the courtroom containing a bed and a few drugs, put an IV in them, and carry out the sentence before the jurors got out of the courthouse.

   "Here&#8217;s refutation of at least one lie repeatedly told by anti-death penalty crowds.\n \n http://www.prodeathpenalty.com/Innocence.htm\n \n A thorough review finds that death penalty opponents have lied, extensively, regarding the numbers of innocents sentenced to death, that such risk is extraordinarily low and that the cessation of executions will put many more innocents at risk.\n \n \n I. Innocents Released from Death Row: A Critical Review of the Claims\n \n Death penalty opponents claim that \"Since 1973, 102 (now 114) people in 25 states have been released from death row with evidence of their innocence,\" (1) \n \n That is a blatantly false claim. \n \n The foundation for these claims begins in 1993, when a study, released by US Rep. Don Edwards, purported to find that 48 innocents had been released from death row since 1973 (2). Rep. Edwards concluded that \"Under the law, there is no distinction between definitively innocent and those found innocent after a trial.\"\n \n Rep. Edwards was wrong. \n \n The law recognizes the specific distinction between those legally innocent and those actually innocent, just as common sense dictates. Yes, there is a difference between the truly \"I had no connection to the murder\" cases and \"I did it but I got off because of legal error\" cases. \n \n Rep. Edwards and other death penalty opponents combine these two conflicting groups to increase their \"innocents\" number. This is a continuation of a pattern of deception by death penalty opponents, that had been obvious for years.\n \n In addition, Rep. Edwards selected an anti death penalty group, The Death Penalty Information Center (the DPIC), to conduct the study, thereby negating objective confidence in the results.\n \n The source for the updated 102 innocent number is also the DPIC (3). Richard Dieter, head of the DPIC, has confirmed, again, what their \"innocent\" means:\n \n \". . . according to death penalty opponents, who say they make no distinction between legal and factual innocence because there is no difference between the two under the law and because there is no objective way to make such a determination. 'They're innocent in the eyes of the law,' Dieter says. 'That's the only objective standard we have.' \" (4)\n \n What nonsense. \n \n As this public policy debate is only about the actually innocent, we know why the DPIC fails to make that obvious distinction -- they wish to, deceptively, expand their \"innocents\" claims. \n \n Furthermore, for many years, the United States' courts have repeatedly enforced the obvious, common sense, important distinction between the actually innocent and the legally innocent (5). Mr. Dieter and all of those active in this debate are well aware of this. Death penalty opponents have chosen to be deceptive. (also see Sections IV. OK to Execute the Innocent? and VI. The Innocent Executed, below). This is hardly surprising.\n \n As Dieter and other death penalty opponents make no distinction between the actually innocent and the legally innocent, why don't they claim that over 2500 innocents have been \"exonerated\" from death row? That is the number of legally and actually innocent released from death row since 1973 (6). The answer is obvious. They hoped that the media and others might just assume that the 102 (and the previous lesser numbers) were actually innocent and not ask any questions. And that is exactly what has happened -- a successful deception, aided by the poor fact checking standards of the media. The 2500 number, even for the media, is just too large a number for such blind acceptance. \n \n As this deception has begun to unravel, Dieter \"clarifies\" that all 102 former death row inmates on the innocence list have been exonerated in one of three ways. \n \n \"A defendant whose conviction is overturned by a judge must be further exonerated in one of three ways: he must be acquitted at a new trial, or the prosecutor must drop the charges against him, or a governor must grant an absolute pardon.\" (7)\n \n Dieter is consistent. \n \n None of those exoneration categories establishes, or even suggests, actual innocence. \n \n Acquittal, which is a \"not guilty\" verdict, means that the state was unable to meet the necessary burden of proof, in establishing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. It has nothing to do with establishing actual innocence. \n \n In a case that has been overturned on appeal, the prosecution may drop the charges because of many reasons, the least likely being actual innocence (insert citation). For example, appellate courts may rule that evidence or testimony was constitutionally inadmissible, thereby removing the specific evidence of actual guilt from any prospect of a new trial and, thereby, precluding another trial. \n \n And an absolute pardon may have nothing to do with actual innocence. \n \n Just recall all the uproar over the pardons granted by President Clinton on the eve of his leaving office. I recall only one of those many cases wherein the defendant claimed actual innocence, and I don't recall any appellate judge giving any support to such a claim. Or recall ex-President Richard Nixon, pardoned by President Gerald Ford? Does anyone doubt that President Nixon was actually guilty of obstructing justice? Of course not. \n \n Once again, we have example after example, whereby Dieter tells us that the DPIC standards have nothing to do with actual innocence. And this is simply back peddling on his part. As more and more people observe the extent of the fraud within the innocence claims of death penalty opponents, Dieter and other opponents will continue to change their definitions to justify their deceptive numbers. \n \n And the \"innocence\" standards get worse. \n \n Death penalty opponents have \" . . . included supposedly innocent defendants who were still culpable as accomplices to the actual triggerman.\" (8). The law often finds such criminal accomplices legally guilty for their involvement in murders, even if they, themselves, didn't \"pull the trigger\". For example: Does anyone think that Bin Laden was innocent in the 9/11 World Trade Center bombings?\n \n The DPIC, and other opponents, allegedly so devoted to legal standards in one circumstance -- presumption of innocence -- abandon a legal standard -- the law of parties -- when doing so can further increase their false \"innocents\" claims. \n \n What \"standards\" will death penalty opponents create next to deceptively raise their innocence claims?\n \n As the innocence frauds of death penalty opponents continue to unravel, they are now changing their definitions, as if they never meant that all the cases were actually innocent. In other words, they are just piling lie upon lie. \n \n The evidence is overwhelming that some death penalty opponents were stating that the 102, nationwide, were actually innocent people, who had no connection to the murders. They lied.\n \n Now they are stating it was just some function of release, as related above, or that they were only speaking of the \"presumption of innocence\", the legal standard for defendants, during trial. They have always been lying about the collective innocence claims, now they deceptively change the definitions, as their previous claims are imploding.\n \n The DPIC's newest standard?\n \n \"There may be guilty persons among the innocents, but that includes all of us.\" (9). Good grief. DPIC wishes to apply collective guilt of capital murder to all of us. Or maybe DPIC is about to declare all those sentenced to death and executed as innocent. Take your pick, they could go either way.\n \n A final mea culpa?\n \n Dieter states: \"I don't think anybody can know about a person's absolute innocence.\" (Green). In other words, Dieter won't assert absolute innocence in 1, 102 or 350 cases. Not today, anyway.\n \n Or, Dieter will declare all innocent: \"If you are not proven guilty in a court of law, you're innocent.\" (Green) By this all inclusive (and ridiculous) standard, Dieter would call Hitler and Stalin innocent. \n \n So no one deludes themselves, the innocence concern has always been about convicting the actually innocent -- the \"I had no connection to the murder\" cases -- and what risk that represents for executing an actually innocent person. \n \n Even Dieter has always known (and never disputed, so far) that we don't execute legally innocent people.\n \n Death penalty opponents wrongly state the burden of proof for \"innocents\" is not theirs to make -- that defendants are \"innocent until proven guilty\". This is pure sophistry. The \"innocent until proven guilty\" is a legal standard, that only applies to fact finders in a criminal case. The \"innocent\" claims by death penalty opponents are part of a public policy debate which, allegedly, is concerned with the actually innocent sent to death row and how that may result in an actually innocent executed.\n \n What is the real number of actual innocents released from death row?\n \n A review of the DPIC 102 case descriptions finds that only about 32 claim actual innocence, with alleged proof to support the claim. 12 of those 32 are DNA cases. That is 32 cases out of about 7300 death sentences since 1973, or 0.4%. National Review's Senior Editor Ramesh Ponnuru, independently, came up with the same number for his \"Bad List\" article (10).\n \n When reviewing various case descriptions by DPIC and then comparing them to the actual record, there is an obvious pattern of inaccuracy (11). This provides little doubt that many of the remaining 32 case descriptions by DPIC are also inaccurate. No responsible, objective party would depend upon the DPIC case descriptions.\n \n Furthermore, Northwest U. Law Prof. Lawrence Marshall, a death penalty opponent, who organized the National Conference on Wrongful Convictions and the Death Penalty in Chicago 1998, stated that, \"In a good half of these 75 [now 102] cases, the exoneration is so complete that it erases any doubt whatsoever,\" (12). Prof. Marshall's uncorroborated claims find proof of factual innocence in 38 cases. \n \n Why do death penalty opponents claim that they have proof for half their innocent claims, then claim twice that number as innocent? \n \n This claim is consistent with the 13 innocents/exonerations from Illinois. There appears to be some doubt about an innocence claim in about half of those cases. (13)\n \n California Assistant Attorney General Ward Campbell finds that at least 68 of the DPIC 102 cases do not belong on the innocence list. He has not conceded that all the remaining 34 do belong on the list. (14).\n \n \"On July 1, 2002, in the case of United States v. Quinones, 205 F.Supp.2d 256 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York declared that the Federal Death Penalty Act (was) unconstitutional.\" \n \n \"The federal court based its decision in part on the DPIC List. The federal court itself analyzed the List and applied undefined &#8220;conservative criteria&#8221; to conclude that 40 defendants on the List were released on grounds indicating &#8220;factual innocence.&#8221; However, 23 of the names on the Quinones&#8217; List are names which (Ward Campbell's) study submits should be eliminated from the DPIC List.\"\n \n \"If the Quinones court's analysis of the DPIC List is combined with this critique's (Campbell's) analysis, only 17 defendants should be on the List, not the 102 defendants currently listed.\" (14A).\n \n Furthermore, the Judge in that Quinones case, Rakoff, has since stated that the innocence number might be 30, not the 40 he stated during the case, indicating the combined numbers are, now, most certainly, lower than 17.\n \n Of those 102 DPIC \"innocent\" cases, 24 have been identified by the DPIC as being from the state of Florida. The Florida Commission on Capital Cases conducted a thorough review of those 24 cases. The Commission found that 4 of those might have a credible claim of actual innocence. (15). \n \n That reveals an 83% error by the DPIC in their Florida case descriptions. If the DPIC has a consistent error rate, nationwide, that would indicate that there is evidence for claiming 17 actual innocents within their 102 innocents claim -- or 0.2% of the 7400 sentenced to death since 1973.\n \n It is hardly a coincidence that the same number of likely actual innocents -- 17 -- is also found when combining the Campbell and Quinones lists.\n \n Based upon those three reviews, 17 is the most credible number for actual innocents released from death row since 1973. And 83% seems to be the common error rate for \"innocents\" claims by death penalty opponents.\n \n SPECIFIC CASES\n \n See \"The Innocence Fraud of Death Penalty Opponents\"\n \n Another case on the DPIC list is James Creamer, who was never subject to execution (17). The jury gave him a death sentence, even though there was no death penalty option, because the Furman v Georgia case (1972) had voided all death penalty statutes then in existence Even so, Creamer was sentenced to death on 2/4/73 and then was resentenced to life on 9/28/73. He is still on the DPIC innocents released from death row list (No. 5, as of 6/3/02). \n \n Death penalty opponents (and the media) gave much play to that \"100th case\" - Ray Krone. It is an instructive example. \n \n He was not on death row, at the time he was found innocent via DNA testing. His death sentence was overturned in 1995. He was retried and given a life sentence in 1996 (18). Inmates released from prison sentences, because of innocence evidence, are not \"released from death row with evidence of their innocence.\" which is the DPIC \"standard\" to be on the list. Death penalty opponents do what they can to fraudulently raise their numbers. \n \n Certainly a \"100\" could be considered a milestone. What few realized (or cared to investigate) is that it was a milestone of deception by death penalty opponents.\n \n At least 11 of the cases were not even on death row at the time of their \"innocence\" discovery. 6 of the DPIC listed cases were not on death row when released and were prosecuted prior to 1973, in the pre Furman v Georgia (1972) era and, therefore, have no place in a modern era discussion of \"innocents\" released from death row (19).\n \n And, at least four of the post 1973 convictions, Henry Drake, Jay Smith, Kirk Bloodsworth and Ray Krone, were not on death row when they won their freedom. Krone, the now famous 100th case, had not been on death row for 7 years, when he was found innocent via DNA. \n \n None of those 11 are death row exonerations. They are prison exonerations. Therefore, the 32 cases becomes the 21 \"released from death row with evidence of their innocence.\" And, obviously, no one can depend on the DPIC case descriptions regarding how many more of the 102 (or the 21) cases were not on death row at the time they were \"released from death row with evidence of their innocence.\" Nor should anyone blindly accept the uncorroborated claims of death penalty opponents that all of those 21 are actually innocent.\n \n Professor Marshall stated that \"the exoneration is so complete that it erases any doubt whatsoever.\" If true, where is the independent, objective study which removes all doubt in 21-32 cases? It doesn't exist. Can death penalty opponents present, at least, a review wherein 21-32 cases have a consensus of opinion, whereby the evidence, the prosecutors, defense counsel and the appellate courts agree on the actual innocence issue? If so, it is no where to be found.\n \n How many of those sentenced to death since 1973 have subsequently been released from death row because of actual innocence? It is likely between 15 and 30. 17 being the most realistic number, as it reflects findings in the three most thorough reviews -- Rakoff/Quinones, Campbell and the Florida Commission. \n \n The 102 number means nothing, except as a ruse to fool the press and the public.\n \n In a joint press release, dated May 7, 2002, the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty and the Texas Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty stated:\n \n \"More than 100 people have now been released from death row due to actual innocence.\" (20)\n \n Are such comments part of an organized deception or do they reflect willful ignorance? \n \n THE MEDIA\n \n With remarkably few exceptions, neither the media nor public policy makers have required death penalty opponents to support their claims or to define their standards. \n \n In fact, the rule is that the media repeats exactly what anti death penalty sources tell them, without question and passes it along to their audience. This may be one of the worst \"no fact checking\" examples in journalistic history.\n \n As previously suggested (21), possibly, in the future, both the media and policy makers may inquire:\n \n -- For how many of these claims is there proof of actual innocence? \n ---Were those \"innocents\" completely unconnected to the murder? \n ---Were they on death row at the time their innocence was proven?\n ---Can you provide confirmable, independent support of these claims?\n ---What are the opinions by the district attorneys and the appellate courts for these claims?\n \n All reasonable and necessary questions to ascertain the veracity of the claims.\n \n Isn't it better to be clear and specific? As opposed to unclear, unsure and nebulous?\n \n Does the number matter? Only if accuracy and truth are important in public policy decisions and media reports.\n \n (NOTE -- The DPIC list is now over 102. Their claims are so misleading we have stopped updating at 102.)\n \n II. The Risk to Innocents if We Don't Execute\n \n We have overwhelming proof that living murderers harm and murder again, in prison, after improper release and, as we so recently experienced, after escape. No one disputes that living murderers are infinitely more likely to harm and murder again than are executed murderers. And, there is no proof of an innocent executed within the US since 1900. \n \n Some supporters of a moratorium and death penalty opponents claim that a concern for innocents is why they want to halt executions. Yet, history and reason confirm that an end to executions will result in more innocents harmed and murdered.\n \n Furthermore, any assertion that the death penalty is not a deterrent is false. Those studies not finding for deterrence do not say it doesn't exist. Those studies finding for deterrence state that is does. A statutory challenge caused a temporary halt to executions in Texas, in 1996. The result? \"The [Texas] execution hiatus, therefore, appears to have spared few, if any, condemned prisoners while the citizens of Texas experienced a net 90 [up to 150) additional innocent lives lost to homicide. Politicians contemplating moratoriums may wish to consider the possibility that a seemingly innocuous moratorium on executions could very well come at a heavy cost.\" (22)\n \n This is not surprising, as history, reason, common sense and the social sciences all support that the potential for negative consequences deters or alters the behavior of many, if not most.\n \n Recently, at least three innocent people were murdered by escaped murderers. That is three more than we have proof for innocents executed since 1900. \n \n At least 8% of those on death row had committed one or more murders prior to the murder(s) which put them on death row (23), suggesting that with 7,300 sentenced to death, since 1973, that those sent to death row had murdered at least 600 additional innocents after we failed to properly restrain them after their previous murder(s). Justice Department studies suggest that it is likely that some 2 million innocents have been harmed, 100,000 murdered, since 1973, by criminals while \"supervised\" by US criminal justice systems (parole, probation, mandatory release, furloughs, pre trial releases, etc.) (24).\n \n In any review of criminal justice practices and their failings, we are looking at errors in judgment and procedure. Yet, with such catastrophic harm to innocents, coming from other criminal justice shortcomings, some have chosen to pursue a moratorium on executions -- a criminal justice practice lacking proof of an innocent killed, at least since 1900. Is the priority to protect innocent lives or to get rid of the death penalty? A review of criminal justice realities makes that an obvious question.\n \n It currently takes nearly 12 years to execute those sentenced to death (25). And some elected officials are debating a moratorium on executions. Yet, under all debated scenarios, halting executions will put more innocents at risk.\n \n III. Due Process and The Risk to Innocents\n \n Protecting innocent defendants/inmates\n \n Is there any other criminal sanction, anywhere in the world, where one might find a 99.6% guilt accuracy rate, after 30 years of biased, unverified review by opponents of that sanction, wherein all those allegedly innocents had been secured from their punishments by post conviction review?\n \n The US Supreme Court has stated that those subject to the death penalty in the US receive super due process. It is easy to see why. From 1973-2001, 7096 people were sent to death row. 2523 of those cases, or 35.4%, were overturned on appeal or had their sentence commuted. 749, or 10.6%, were executed (26), after an average of over 10 years on death row (27). The time between sentencing and execution has risen from an average of 8 years in 1989 to nearly 12 years in 2001 (28).\n \n Consideration of error, be it the actually innocent convicted or procedural, is why we have appeals and the commutation/clemency process. The system anticipates error and provides remedy. While the actually innocent convicted is a horrible result, in the subject cases, none have been executed.\n \n Few dispute that death penalty cases have the greatest level of due process protections. Therefore, if your objection to execution is the possibility of irreversible error, such due process concludes that it is much more likely that an innocent sentenced to a life term will die, as an innocent in prison, than it is that an innocent will be executed. Both irreversible error, but one much more likely than the other.\n \n It appears that the US death penalty is that criminal justice sanction which is the least likely to find the innocent guilty and the most likely to correct those rare errors upon post conviction review.\n \n Sacrificing the innocent\n \n The due process protections of the US death penalty are so extraordinary, that we have released over 2500 people from death row since 1973. Although no known study of the harm committed by those so taken off death row has been performed, there is no doubt that many innocents have been murdered or otherwise harmed by those so released. \n \n One group of released death row inmates has been subject to limited review. When the US Supreme Court found in Furman v Georgia, in 1972, that the death penalty, as it was then enforced, was unconstitutional, all death row inmates had their death sentences commuted. It appears that some 12 innocents have been murdered by those Furman releasees, through 1987, in addition to other horrendous crimes committed by that same group. (still finalizing confirmation). We are unaware of any updated review covering the next 15 years, through 2002. \n \n This is not an argument against super due process, but a recognition of one reality of it. \n \n Such due process provides unparalleled protection for the actually innocent, extraordinary generosity to guilty murderers -- relief that turns into suffering for those innocents harmed by those spared murderers.\n \n IV. OK to Execute the Innocent?\n \n Some death penalty opponents have wrongly interpreted that the US Supreme Court decision in Herrera v Collins (113 S. Ct. 853, 870{1993}) found that executing the innocent was quite all right.\n \n \"Justice [Sandra Day] O'Connor's concurring opinion makes clear that Herrera does not stand for that proposition. Justice O'Connor stated, I cannot disagree with the fundamental legal principal that executing the innocent is inconsistent with the Constitution and the execution of a legally and factually innocent person would be a constitutionally intolerable event. As Justice O'Connor stated, the Court assumed for the sake of argument that a truly persuasive demonstration of actual innocence would render any such execution unconstitutional and that federal habeas relief would be warranted if no state avenue were open to process the claim. Id., at 874. That is the holding in Herrera, and any claim to the contrary is simply not correct.\" (Kenneth S. Nunnelley's Congressional testimony, July 23, 1993)\n \n V. Future innocence considerations\n \n The DPIC alleges that 12 of their 102 \"innocents\" were proven actually innocent because their DNA screenings were negative. Based upon the DPIC's standards, we cannot be sure of all such innocent claims because, in some of the cases, \"Non-matching DNA is consistent with the prosecution's theory of multiple perpetrators\" (29) and, therefore, may not signify innocence.\n \n In any future cases, where DNA is determinative of guilt or innocence, any such innocent cases will never go to trial. For many reasons, including DNA testing, the US death penalty, is much safer today than it has ever been.\n \n As the best predictor of future performance is past performance, what will the future risk to innocents be? \n \n Based upon the evidence we have today, using anti death penalty standards and their uncorroborated claims, with the next 7300 death sentences given, nationwide, we may sentence 3-18 actually innocent persons to death, or about 0.2%, (30) and the alleged innocent will all be taken off death row via post conviction review or, otherwise, not be executed. What this doesn't take into account is that many jurisdictions have, for quite some time, already raised the qualification level for defense counsel and prosecutors and some also require two defense attorneys to be appointed in capital cases.\n \n Almost without exception, those few highly publicized death penalty cases, which have caused great public rancor, were prosecuted 15-25 years ago. More recent cases are much less likely to provoke controversy or false claims of innocence. Why? There is a higher quality of prosecution and defense in these cases and new death penalty law, which began after Furman v Georgia (1972), is more settled than it had been from 1973-1987.\n \n Finally, a review of many of those earlier highly publicized cases revealed that many of the anti-death penalty claims were and are either false or deceptive. (31)\n \n VI. The Innocent Executed\n \n It is not at all uncommon for death penalty opponents to make false claims about innocents executed. As of 1/1/03, The National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty (NCADP) claims that \"Twenty three (23) innocent people have been mistakenly executed (in the US) this (the 20th) century.\" (32) This is a common false claim, even though the authors of that 1987 study, in response to a deconstruction of their work, stated, in 1988, that \"We agree with our critics that we have not proved these (23) executed defendants to be innocent; we never claimed that we had.\" (33). The NCADP is well aware of this, yet it doesn't stop their deception.\n \n Barry Scheck, cofounder of the Innocence Project and featured speaker at the National Conference on Wrongful Convictions and the Death Penalty (11/13-15/98), stated that he had no proof of an innocent executed (in the US since 1976) (34).\n \n Not even the nation's leading, biased source for anti death penalty information, the DPIC, says there is proof of an innocent executed. They list 5 \"doubt\" cases (35): Gary Graham, Joseph O'Dell, Roger Keith Coleman, Leo Jones and David Spence. A review shows how deceptive the DPIC case descriptions are (36) and how lacking any proof of innocence is.\n \n The Texas case of Lionel Herrera, like others, nationally, has been labeled, by many death penalty opponents, as an innocent executed. I believe that Herrera, once upon a time, was also included in a previous incarnation of the DPIC list. A comment from Supreme Court Justice O'Connor. \"[T]he proper disposition of this case is neither difficult nor troubling . . . The record overwhelmingly demonstrates that petitioner [Herrera] deliberately shot and killed Officers Rucker and Carrisalez the night of September 29, 1981; petitioner's new evidence is bereft of credibility. Indeed, despite its stinging criticism of the Court's decision, not even the dissent expresses a belief that petitioner might possibly be actually innocent.\" Herrera v. Collins, 506 US 390, 421(1993) (O'Connor, J., concurring)\n \n Of all the world's social and governmental institutions, that do put innocents at risk, I am aware of only one, the US death penalty, that has no proof of an innocent killed since 1900. Can you name another?\n \n VII. Conclusion\n \n No one disputes that an innocent sentenced to death is a horrible result. Appeals and commutation/clemency deliberations are an integral and inescapable part of a criminal justice system that both anticipate error and provide remedy. Both sides of the death penalty debate are equally concerned about the moral implication of executing an innocent. Those of us who support execution recognize that any innocents sentenced to death or executed injure our position.\n \n A concern for the innocent will result in a rejection of a moratorium and more support for executions. Either by a moratorium, or by outright repeal, stopping executions will always put many more innocents at risk. Death penalty opponents knows this. Their alleged concern for innocents is but another distortion based campaign to end the death penalty.\n \n When reason and all the facts prevail, support for executions will rise.\n \n copyright 1998-2004 Dudley Sharp\n \n \n PLEASE REFUTE THESE CLAIMS!!",

   "OP by JT\n By the way, I believe I&#8217;m correct in saying there has not been an innocent person put to death since 1900. At least I think I remember reading that recently.\n \n &#8230;and here it is.\n \n \n \n \n \n The most significant study conducted to evaluate the evidence of the \"innocent executed\" is the Bedau-Radelet Study (\"Miscarriages of Justice in Potentially Capital Cases,\" 40, 1 Stanford Law Review, 11/87). The study concluded that 23 innocent persons had been executed since 1900. However, the study's methodology was so flawed that at least 12 of those cases had no evidence of innocence and substantial evidence of guilt. Bedau & Radelet, both opponents, \"consistently presented incomplete and misleading accounts of the evidence.\" (Markman, Stephen J. & Cassell, Paul G., \"Protecting the Innocent: A Response to the Bedau-Radelet Study\" 41, 1 Stanford Law Review, 11/88). The remaining 11 cases represent 0.14% of the 7,800 executions which have taken place since 1900. And, there is, in fact, no proof that those 11 executed were innocent. In addition, the \"innocents executed\" group was extracted from a Bedau & Radelet imagined pool of 350 persons who were, supposedly, wrongly convicted of capital or \"potentially\" capital crimes. Not only were they at least 50% in error with their 23 \"innocents executed\" claim, but 211 of those 350 cases, or 60%, were not sentenced to death. Bedau and Radelet already knew that plea bargains, the juries, the evidence, the prosecutors, judicial review and/or the legal statutes had put these crimes in the \"no capital punishment\" category. Indeed, their claims of innocence, regarding the remaining 139 of those 350 cases, should be suspect, given this study&#8217;s poor level of accuracy. Calling their work misleading hardly does this \"academic\" study justice. Had a high school student presented such a report, where 50-60% of the material was either false or misleading, a grade of F would be a likely result. \n \n Indeed, Michigan Court of Appeals Judge Stephen Markman finds that \" . . . the Bedau-Radelet study is remarkable not (as retired Supreme Court Judge Harry Blackmun seems to believe) for demonstrating that mistakes involving the death penalty are common, but rather for demonstrating how uncommon they are . . . This study - the most thorough and painstaking analysis ever on the subject - fails to prove that a single such mistake has occurred in the United States during the twentieth century.\" Presumably, Bedau and Radelet would have selected the most compelling 23 cases of the innocent executed to prove their proposition. \"Yet, in each of these cases, where there is a record to review, there are eyewitnesses, confessions, physical evidence and circumstantial evidence in support of the defendant&#8217;s guilt. Bedau has written elsewhere that it is &#8216;false sentimentality to argue that the death penalty ought to be abolished because of the abstract possibility that an innocent person might be executed when the record fails to disclose that such cases exist.&#8217; . . . (T)he Bedau and Radelet study . . . speaks eloquently about the extraordinary rarity of error in capital punishment.\" (\"Innocents on Death Row?\", National Review, September 12, 1994). \n \n Another significant oversight by that study was not differentiating between the risk of executing innocent persons before and after Furman v Georgia (1972). There is, in fact, no proof that an innocent has been executed since 1900. And the probability of such a tragedy occurring has been lowered significantly more since Furman. In the context that hundreds of thousands of innocents have been murdered or seriously injured, since 1900, by criminals improperly released by the U.S. criminal justice system (or not incarcerated at all!), the relevant question is: Is the risk of executing the innocent, however slight, worth the justifications for the death penalty - those being retribution, rehabilitation, incapacitation, required punishment, deterrence, escalating punishments, religious mandates, cost savings, the moral imperative, just punishment and the saving of innocent lives? \n \n Predictably, opponents still continue to fraudulently claim, even today*, that this study has proven that 23 \"innocent\" people have been executed, even though Bedau and Radelet, the authors of that study, conceded - in 1988 - that neither they nor any previous researchers have proved that any of those executed was innocent: \"We agree with our critics that we have not proved these executed defendants to be innocent; we never claimed that we had.\" (41, 1 Stanford Law Review, 11/1988).\n \n http://www.prodeathpenalty.com/DP.html#A.Innocence",

The death penalty costs the tax payers more and benefits neither the dead, nor society, in any way, and society doesn't punish in order to \"get revenge.\" \n \n\n And again:\n \n\n My argument makes it clear that innocent people need not be sentenced to death in order for the death penalty to be unjust.

A number of factors can make a single appeal worthless. Racial bias has been a factor in sending a black man to the execution block and a white man to life. And the whole DNA thing is not a silver bullet. Plus the backlog on the labs is so immense that DAs are banned from sending more then a few samples monthly. A single mistake in handling can render a sample worthless. We need multiple appeals because our system is so fallible and has so many vulnerablities. \n \n \nAlso, when computing the cost of life imprisonment, do they include trial cost? Do they include cost for jail maintenance, construction, and salary for employees? When I compare the two, I compare the cost of simply executing somebody (assuming the decision has already been accepted legally) versus the cost of keeping them in prison for several decades. It is clear keeping them in prsion would be far more expensive in this case.\n\n \n Not really given that many death row inmates spend decades in high security prisons. It costs roughly 60,000 to keep a inmate in a high security prison a year. Even over the course of 50 years that can't compare to a trial or series of trials that costs over several million after discounting the time value of money. Death costs more then life in prison. And it should be that way.",

Like I said, this is an impossible thing to measure accurately; there is simply no good way to apply the scientific method here as there are too many variables.

That isn't an argument, and you haven't refuted anything. In fact, I agree with you. Too often, after the death penalty is sentenced, people sit and sit on death row while the appeals process goes on and on. People have actually died on death row waiting to be executed. The point I was trying to make here, which you seem to have ignored (or cannot address), is that you cite the legal system for being imperfect as far as convicting innocents (which, incidentally, is usually based on a jury). Then you turn around and assume the legal system is perfect when it comes down to handing out and enforcing sentences, which it isn't. I do not make these claims. If someone is sentenced to life in prison without parole and they get out, that is a problem. If somebody is sentenced to the death penalty and they aren't executed, that is a problem. If somebody is completely innocent and they are executed for a crime they didn't commit (which, with forensics these days, probably will never happen again), that is a problem. If somebody is let out of prison and they victimize another innocent person, that is a problem. None of these problems warrent abolishing the death penalty.\n \n \nAnd embryo is not a sentinent being. A person is. Secondly, its a complete contradiction for you to be pro-life and support the DP.

Thats barbaric, and thats hate.\n\n \n I have already explained the purpose it serves. Why do you support the right to bear arms? I'll let you answer that question yourself, and I won't put words in your mouth. However, I will tell you how I see it. If you support the right to bear arms, ultimately you believe that a person should be allowed to kill somebody in self defense. Why doesn't this right translate to the whole of society? Doesn't society have the right to kill people in self defense? Doesn't society have the right to preserve civility and order? I'll go so far as to say society not only has the right, but the responsibility to preserve civility and order. I don't enjoy killing, and I don't want to see executions on TV. Personally, I wish it wasn't needed. To me, it is our right to bear arms as a collective whole. Then you start talking about hate, which makes no sense. You really should leave emotion out of it. I don't want people to be executed because I hate them. I think there are certain crimes that deserve death as a punishment. That is all, plain and simple. My personal emotions have nothing to do with it. \n \n \nThe fact that you condone murder of sentinent beings, yet advocate against a woman's right to choose is puzzling to me, and shows you don't understand either.\n\n \n How do you know a fetus isn't a sentinent being? Do you remember when you were a year old? If not, does that mean you weren't self-aware? Does that mean you weren't a human being? My first memories are around the age of three. Does that mean my mother could have killed me at two years old and that would be okay by you? By the way, I am not against a woman's right to choose. She can choose birth control or even abstinence. Essentially, you believe a fetus should be allowed to be killed simply for existing, while you protect the lives of people who have murdered other innocent people (as murder is generally what a person will get the death penalty for). Doesn't this seem backwards to you? I suppose if you don't understand that a fetus is a life, it makes perfect sense. \n \n \nObviously not protecting the innocent, since the DP serves no purpose.\n\n \n It serves the purpose of punishing people who have committed atrocities against society.\n \n \nThats a stupid and baseless statement. The embryo is not even a sentinent being, therefore there is no \"guilt\" or \"innocence\".\n\n \n Even if that were true, you are conveniently ignoring the fact that the \"sentinent being\" convicted of murder IS guilty and deserves to be punished.\n \n \nThe DP is not equivilant to abortion. It's murdering living breathing humans while abortion does not.\n\n \n If you think that is true, you should read up on abortion. Specifically, late-term abortion. These types of abortions kill thousands more a year than the death penalty ever has. Also, why don't you ever address the fact that we are talking about punishing convicted criminals? You act as if the chance of executing an innocent makes all convicts innocent. Some crimes are so terrible, life in prison just isn't enough.\n \n If you are going to try and bring abortion into this debate, I ask you to answer the questions I have posed regarding the right to bear arms.

That logic is completely flawed and doesn't make sense.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIt serves the purpose of punishing people who have committed atrocities against society.\n\n \n Whats wrong with life in prison?

Specifically, late-term abortion.\n\n \n I'm not for late term abortion.\n \n \n \n \nThese types of abortions kill thousands more a year than the death penalty ever has.\n\n \n What? Since when does the death penalty kill embryos and since when does abortion kill people? Since when is the embryo locked up in a cage like an animal, denied its rights, then put through excruciating pain for an excecution. An embryo isn't even a sentinent being, so all of this is irrelevant. \"Did you know that weeding gardens kills thousands more a year than the death penalty and abortions has put together?\" emoticon_xclown \n \n \n \n \nAlso, why don't you ever address the fact that we are talking about punishing convicted criminals?\n\n \n Because there is a completely viable alternative.

If you are asking me how I an Pro-2A, but Anti-DP, then its because the right to bear arms serves a purpose. It ensures stability in society, keeps crime to a low, and is one of our fundamental civil rights. My positions on matters reflect that I respect individual civil rights and freedoms. None are contradicitions. I am Anti-DP because I respect humans rights, and that they cannot be killed out of anger or hate. I am Pro-Choice because I believe in the individuals right to their own body. I do not believe that the Gov't should make decisions over women's body, since only the women know their circumstances best.

   "You think that because I don't want babies to be killed because of cold hearted irresponsblity of a female who places her social life over the safety of her child and that I demand the death of adults who choose murder as a tool as the resolution to a problem, that my beliefs are antiquated and I am pushing religion? Which verse did I quote? \n Hoping to incite people to do what is right by not indulging in sex until they are prepared to care for the results is unreasonable? Your logic is a grand example of the moral nose dive we are in. \n Animals breed for reproduction purposes and breeding is affected by their enviornment. When food is scarce due to weather or some other reason it effects the activity. When herds of animals overpopulate, the herd suffers even more. Sometimes the herd dies out. \n Humans, thinking they are clever have resorted to killing their young versus excercising self control. One problem they are creating is a major imbalance as a few races abort themselves out of existance, others are mulitiplying in droves. The results should be quite comical. Some races think they are solving overpopulation problems, while others go at it and give no consideration to where their next meal is coming from much less of how to produce enough to feed nations after the clever ones have aborted themselves out of the picture. One group aborting itself into extinction, the other starving and diseasing and breeding themselves out. And all of them blaming some government entity for their woes. \n Duh, I've been georged to death....\n\n \n Other than within belief system dogma who places moral condemnation on sexual relations between two consenting adults who have no desire for reproduction?",

Because back then, the human species was fighting to survive. We needed as much babies as possible. But in the present time, we are actually starting to have an overpopulation problem.

With the first point, why do you assume terminating an unwanted pregnancy is \"selfish\"? An unwanted pregnancy can destroy someone's life, its not just a matter of convenience. Aborting is a wise decision sometimes. Yes, i admit sometimes its not, but most of the time it is, and most women are glad they did. They can move forward, and live their lives now, and a zygote is a small price to pay for someone's well being. Women who do are very brave, in my opinion. They have to walk past the evil pro-life protesters and put herself over other people's hypocritical forced morals, and ignore the pro-life men attempting to violate her body by forcing her to have babies.\n \n Sometimes when i see those pro-life protesters, it makes me want to spray every single one of of them with a paintball gun.

And if you meant \"punishing murder in whatever form in took\" the intelligent way, you would mean: murdering black people is murder, murdering women is murder, murdering children is murder, murdering asian people is murder, or murdering anyone based on their race, sex, or size is murder. If you think removing a zygote parasite is murder then maybe you should rethink your logic.",

   "1. You imply that this is a black and white issue, and that the answer to abortion is to just stop having sex. YOU DON'T KNOW EVERY WOMEN'S CIRCUMSTANCES, and you are in no position to tell them what is right or wrong. For some people, you can't just stop having sex. Sometimes their judgement is impaired (young or drunk) and therefore cannot be held responsible.\n \n 2. Exhibit A, your honor. Claiming embryos and zygotes are \"babies\" when they're far from it. Calling an embryo a baby is like calling a plant an animal. It doesn't work, and its a failing attempt to anthropomorphise an embryo. We're not buying it, and you've only proven further that you have no knowledge of the scientific side of this debate, thus proving you are brainwashed.\n \n 3. You are correct, and do you know why? Because back then, the human species was fighting to survive. We needed as much babies as possible. But in the present time, we are actually starting to have an overpopulation problem. The only reason for opposing abortion would be that it endangeres the human species, but that is not the case now, and I have no idea why any intelligent human being would still think in those terms.\n \n 4. Exhibit B and C, your honor. Trivializing pregnancy and referring to an embryo as a \"child\". With the first point, why do you assume terminating an unwanted pregnancy is \"selfish\"? An unwanted pregnancy can destroy someone's life, its not just a matter of convenience. Aborting is a wise decision sometimes. Yes, i admit sometimes its not, but most of the time it is, and most women are glad they did. They can move forward, and live their lives now, and a zygote is a small price to pay for someone's well being. Women who do are very brave, in my opinion. They have to walk past the evil pro-life protesters and put herself over other people's hypocritical forced morals, and ignore the pro-life men attempting to violate her body by forcing her to have babies.\n \n 5. Sometimes when i see those pro-life protesters, it makes me want to spray every single one of of them with a paintball gun. Ok, i admit that you guys are not brainwashed, the word is unenlightened.\n \n 6. I don't follow you here. Are you attempting to anthropmorphise the fetus again. We live in a society which has set so low expectations for humanity, to the point of pointing to a zygote, then pointing to a human and calling them equal. Why? What is so important, scientifically, about a zygote that makes it a human all of a sudden. Leave your religion and your morals out of it. Scientifically.\n\n \n 1/2. It is black and white. If you're not ready to do what people do naturally when conceiving a child don't do what causes them. People can drink and have sex and that makes killing a child excusable? \n You only call them \"zygotes\" when you don't want the weight of guilt around your neck. \n 3. Agreed. Why would people indulge in the activities, drunk or sober that add to the problems of the world around them. When wondering about decisions of intelligent folks, you may include holding people responsible for their actions instead of holding society responsible for having to decide right and wrong for them. \n 4. Define someone's life being ruined please. The mother in this case, ignore the child for now. \n 5. Why would I be surprised that you would shoot people when killing a child seems acceptable to you? \n 6. By the way, please point out in any post of mine religion or God mentioned as a reason for anything. Also, be advised that I do not wish to legislate against abortion. I would however legislate that girls in the care of their parents can not have an abortion without the express written permission of her parents and that no tax dollars ever pay for the extermination of victims. Or zygotes if it makes you feel cleaner.",

   "5. You often suggest that people's motives are based on religion. A form of dismissing their opinion as the effects of brainwashing. An easy out, popular among folks who resort to belittling another's level of intelligence because they disagree.\n\n I hope you don't mind my jumping into the middle of your discussion, but I would like to address this point of pro-life views being based on religion. I personally am pro-choice but would strongly limit third-trimester abortions since, at that stage, the fetus might start to have a mental existence. The great majority of Americans, on either side of the abortion debate apparently would also strongly limit third trimester abortions (I can supply the poll if you like). However, 2/3rds of Americans would allow abortion in the first trimester. \n \n It is the pro-life view against first trimester abortions that has the least support in non-religioius arguements. I have occasionally asked the question to pro-life supporters: \"What specifically, in that newly fertilized egg, is so precious as to deny the mother the right to her own body?\" The answer I most often get is \"because it is a human life and all human life is precious\". This is a proclamation that, in nearly all cases, seems to come from religion. If there was independent non-religious reasoning behind that proclamation, then nobody who I have debated with has ever presented it. Perhaps you might.",

   "1. It is black and white. Either you believe in it or not. If you do, you are burdened with making the excuses for it.\n\n \n I see we are getting nowhere with this.\n \n \n \n \n \n2. You're weird. You just gave the answer of a 12 year old who got caught with his hand in the cookie jar.\n\n \n Thats your answer to anyone who refutes your odd beliefs? I don't get it, even when I was 12, I couldn't eat cookies. I cannot believe that you've failed to refute that simple argument, I could've see you taking me down piece by piece as that is one of my weaker arguments. But no, Gman gives the \"you got caught\" fallacy and ops out. Oh well.\n \n \n \n \n3. Children are not the slaves of adults, they are kiddies. Adults must feed and clothe and house them and attempt to teach them right from wrong. Part of that process is punishment for being bad. Which includes having sex when the little twerp can't support the child.\n\n \n May I remind you we're talking about a 14-18 year old here and not a 10 year old kid? If someone cannot support the child, then why not have an abortion? Wait a minute, i have an article for you:\n \n http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15173072/site/newsweek/\n \n \n \n \n \n4. If a child can not provide for itself, it has no business having sex. Of course it is physically capable but, it needs to be mentally capable as well.\n\n \n Of course, but many kids are not well educated, and will do it anyway.\n \n \n \n \n \nKiddies are not capable. But you know that. All you care about is that they be allowed to dispose of the result \n and that someone beside them pay for it.\n\n \n Partially correct, however no one pays for an abortion, except maybe the patient's money to the doctor. Why is it so important to you that they have a kid. They were irresponsible having sex, they cannot bear a child, so why the hell should they be parents?\n \n \n \n \n5. Lol. You're weird. You think I should personally donate money to girls who have sex and are not capable of paying for an abortion or support themselves?\n\n \n No, you misunderstood. I'm saying if you really cared about the embryo, you would do something to reduce abortions. One of those things would be to donate money to the poor girls who cannot support children financially, because if they recieve money, they most likely will not abort, and care for the child. But then again, opting out by calling them \"stupid\" shows that you in fact do not care about an embryo.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nHow many of these girls do you support? You don't consider the fact that I pay taxes as enough? Clarify for me my hypocritical statement please.\n\n \n I don't support them because I'm 14 and I don't plan on reducing the number of abortions. You on the other hand...\n \n \n \n \n \n6. Lesson: If you wanna play, you gotta pay.....Refers to the fact that if you do something, there will always be a price to pay.\n\n \n Yes, but why? Why should there be a price to pay? Doesn't paying a price hurt someone, and is that really what we want? We don't want any girls or women to get hurt if they don't have to. Second, since when was pregnancy a punishment.\n \n \n \n \n \nIn this case the price is either the burden of loving and nourishing a child made from love or exterminating it and suffering, for the rest of one's life, doubts about the decency of yourself.\n\n \n Wrong. Studies have actually shown that people regret having the kid much more than they do having an abortion. Many women do not regret having and abortion, and never will, however most women with unwanted pregnancies do regret having their kids. Where did you get that crazy idea?\n \n \n \n \n \n \n7. Calm down. Check your pulse. Take a deep breath. You'll be ok.\n\n \n Opt out #2. I'll give you one more chance to answer this post.\n \n \n \n \n \n8. I can't make sense of your statement. Was it a response to something I said?\n\n \n First of all, welcome to my world. Second, you just opted out yet again. Why can't you reply to these simple posts?\n \n \n \n \n9. Wow. No, by showing them that being pregnant and not disposing of the child does not \"ruin\" their lives.\n\n \n Please, tell me how you propose to do that.\n \n \n \n \n \n10. Putting themselves in the position to have to choose an action that will kill or make themselves feel worse about themselves is wrong. If you deny that, you are simply arguing so as to feel superior.\n\n \n Where is your common sense? A large percentage of women who have abortions do not regret it, and are actually glad they did it. I don't understand what the heck you're talking about here.\n \n \n \n \n11. That answer makes you no more correct in your accusation.\n\n \n Does it? How does it make me no more correct?\n \n \n \n \n12. \"I am not dismissing their opinions or using an \"easy out\".\"\n The statement you follow this with does exactly that. Dismisses.\n\n \n The irony is killing me.\n \n \n \n \n13. You think that a girl, living under her father and mother's roof. Eating their food, using their utilities, wearing clothes provided by them, driving their vehicles has the right to have sex and an abortion without informing them? \n Who, pray tell should pay for this abortion? Tax payers? Or the suckers you want to donate to these poor helpless people?\n\n \n I don't understand the majority of that statement, however i can make out some. Just because you live with someone and they're taking care of you, doesn't give them the right to own you. They are still human beings, and even though their parents are providing for them, they still have no right to steal away all of someone else's liberty.\n \n \n \n \n \n14. I don't wonder why teens commit suicide. I know. \n Teens commit suicide for the same reason moronic adults commit suicide. \n Self centered pathetic visionless wimps.\n\n \n Wow, that was cold. Maybe you should get to know some of these depressed teenagers before you call them \"pathetic\". How many suicidal teenagers do you know?",

   "Dennis Fritz is a man who needs to be noticed more. His Book changed my views about the Death Penalty. He is the Other Innocent Man in John Grisham's The Innocent Man, he wrote a book called Journey Toward Justice Published by Seven Locks Press. A Companion book to The Innocent Man. Dennis Fritz writes his own story about unwarranted prosecution and wrongful conviction and is a true crime. Endorsed on Jacket by John Grisham which he states as Compelling and Fascinating.\n Journey Toward Justice is a testimony to the Triumph of the human Spirit and is a Memoir. Dennis Fritz was wrongfully convicted of rape and murder after a swift trail.\n The only thing that saved him from the Death Penalty was a lone vote from a juror. Dennis Fritz was the other Innocent man mentioned in John Grisham's Book. which mainly is about Ronnie Williamson, Dennis Fritz's co-defendant. Both were exonerated after spending 12 years in prison.\n \n The real killer was one of the Prosecution's Key Witness. Read about why he went on a special diet of his while in prison, amazing and shocking. Dennis Fritz's Story of unwarranted prosecution and wrongful conviction needs to be\n heard. Read about how he wrote hundreds of letters and appellate briefs in his own defense and immersed himself in an intense study of law.\n He was a school teacher and a ordinary man whose wife was brutally murdered in 1975 by a deranged 17 year old neighbor. On May 8th 1987, Five years after Debbie Sue Carter's rape and murder he was home with his young daughter and put under arrest, handcuffed and on his way to jail on charges of rape and murder.\n \n After 10 years in prison he discovered The Innocence Project, a non-profit legal organization. With the aid of Barry Scheck and DNA evidence Dennis Fritz was exonerated on April 15,1999 Since then, it has been a long hard road filled with twist and turns and now on his Journey Toward Justice. He never blamed the Lord and solely relied on his faith in God to make it through.\n He waited for God's time and never gave up.\n I can not add links at this moment But, For more information on Dennis Fritz and many issues in his book google me \"barbara's journey toward justice'. Thank you for reading this and please visit my blog.",

I'm just sayin...\n\n That has been brought up time and time again between the 2 DP threads current. The problem is, there are those who refuse to listen to logic here. \n \n The shamelss self promotion of BJTJ is a fine example (which by the way he has posted the same post 4 times now in different threads). Fritz was sentenced to LWOP, not the death penalty. But did his innocence change the posters mind about LWOP...no, it changed his mind about the death penalty. Don't forget, that Fritz was FIRST found guilty, then sentenced. So shouldn't people really be fighting for change in the trial process, rather than the sentencing process? What absolutely kills me about the anti-crowd is that they could care less about anyone sentenced to LWOP, guilty or not. But add the death penalty, and all of the sudden everyone is innocent and it's a gross miscarriage of justice. What a crock of $hit.",
