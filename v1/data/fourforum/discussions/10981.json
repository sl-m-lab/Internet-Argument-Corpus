   "You know...\n \n It seems to me a quite dreadful affair\n To have ones mind take to such disrepair\n As to think-\n When I drink-\n In the depths of the night\n That I ever could give up the day job and write\n Or could manage the leap back from fire to pan\n And yet when I began... \n \n I thought otherwise then\n So I took up my pen\n And with treacherous confidence pressed it again\n To the page I had bested so often before\n And with Albeniz plucking a musical score\n I compelled it to travel\n The plot to unravel\n With words to bedazzle as never before!\n \n But...\n \n Perhaps it was genius courting my ear\n That inspired uncertainty, nervousness, fear\n Or perhaps it was simply the blank of the page\n That defeated my sage\n I confess at that stage\n To a kind of despair\n An ineloquent rage had me choked in its snare\n As I huddled there bathed in that pitiless glare.\n \n Now I sit as I did with my pen in my hand\n Ever ready to move at my slightest command\n Yet the page still remains \n And the taunting refrains\n Of that damnable Albeniz circle my brains\n Shall I ever be free of their exquisite glee?\n Must I suffer possessing less talent than he?\n Will the nib of my pen yet immortalize me?",
