   "Abortion is not the issue, in the abortion-discussion- the Constitution is, just like slavery wasn't the issue in the Civil War.\n Roe v. Wade held that the Common Law superseded state statutes under the 9th Amendment; this deliberately ignores the soveriegnty of the states prior to the Constitution, and the rights reserved by the people of each state to govern themselves above and beyond any Common Law pre-dating such.\n The Declaration of Independence clearly states that \"We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these united Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States, that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do.\"\n \n Therefore, each state was an independent sovereignty prior to the Constitution and the 9th Amendment.\n \n Even Yale Constitutional Law professor Akhil Amar admits that they were independent nations prior to the Constitution-- though he claims that this is when it ended; in America's Constitution, he writes that \"the United States did not become an indivisible nation prohibiting unilateral state secession...until 1788. Lincoln also stumbled in claiming that none of the thirteen original states had ever been sovereign.\" \n \n The 9th Amendment reads as follows:\n \n \"The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\"\n \n Even conceding a collective context to the term \"People\" to denote those of all states combined: since this was an amendment to the Constitution, then it clearly pertained only to rights retained PRIOR TO the Constitution-- when no such \"people\" existed other than those of the states individually-- i.e. the Peoples of the states respectively.\n \n This therefore pertains to such pre-Constitutional rights retained by the People of the individual states, protecting them against encroachment by federal statutes--, not \"the people\" as a whole against encroachment by state statutes; on the contrary, such prohibition falls under the TENTH Amendment, which expressly holds that \"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the [respective] people [thereof].\" \n Naturally, the people of a state can't \"retain\" a right against themselves.\n \n Neither are the right to \"privacy,\" or to statutorily determine when human life begins for the purpose of protecting it, is anywhere delegated to the federal government in the Constitution-- nor prohibited to the states; therefore the power to protect these rights is reserved to the states respectively, and to the people thereof.\n \n The Supreme Court, therefore, simply usurped state sanctity under the 10th Amendment, via miscontruing the 9th in order to grant it carte blanche to likewise misconstrue any \"right\" it pleased, through pure jibberish.\n Likewise, nowhere else does the Court construe Common Law to supersede state law, but rather reserves this expressly for Roe v. Wade-- Even a first-year law student knows that state statutes supersede common law.\n But by this ruling, the Court opens the door to further misconstruction-- truly to the medieval Dark Ages in upholding ancient laws over modern revision in violation of their basic independence from such.",

White). Otherwise, the only similar right would be the specific enumeration in the 4th Amendment of \"the right of the people to be secure in their homes, papers persons and effects from unreasonable searches and siezures\" etc. However neither is this not a carte blanche, but simply a requirement for express warrants.\n As such, the court simply waved its magic post-bellum gavel, and cooked up a story to grant itself more power against the states.\n \n \nAdditionally, the court in Roe did not decide that common law superseded state statutes; rather, it purported (quite wrongly in this case) to hold that the Constitution superseded state statutes regarding abortion.\n\n Nope.

Wade was decided primarily on the 9th Amendment in stating that \"the enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people,\" protected a person's right to privacy.\n\n No, it wasn't.\n \n \nThis right of privacy, whether it be founded in the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court determined, in the Ninth Amendment's reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.\n\n \n So, the Supreme Court rested its decision not on the 9th Amendment as the District Court had done, but chose instead to base it on the 14th Amendment.\n \n \nSince privacy isn not mentioned in the Constitution, then it wasn't delegated to the federal government-- unless they could claim it as a \"retained\" right-- i.e. from Common Law, once again ignoring pre-constitutional history and state sovereignty (see Texas v.

They referenced pre-American common law (selectively) in order to claim that abortion was legal under such, and that no law recognized personhood as commencing prior to birth.\n\n Not exactly. They used a survey of common law history to conclude that a woman's personal liberty interests outweighed the states interest in protecting the fetus' life, and that a fetus was not a \"person\" within the meaning of the 14th Amendment. This is important because it shows that Roe purportedly rests on the 14th Amendment, and as such, is incorrect because it employed the use of the illegitimate legal doctrine of substantive due process to do so. \n \n The court was possibly correct that a fetus was not a person within the meaning of the 14th Amendment, even though their survey of common law was selective and ultimately incorrect. This isn't what decided the case though, because states have been allowed to regulate things even where constitutional persons were not involved. The court erred in finding a positive individual Constitutional right, through the rubric of privacy, to terminate a pregnancy. The court did not justify its holding that states could not regulate the procedure as they had done since the early 1800s on the text and history of the Constitution; rather, it just made it up.\n \n \nIn any event, this just proves Madison's warning in his Reports on the Virginia Resolutions, that \" However true, therefore, it may be, that the judicial department is, in all questions submitted to it by the forms of the Constitution, to decide in the last resort, this resort must necessarily be deemed the last in relation to the authorities of the other departments of the government; not in relation to the rights of the parties to the constitutional compact, from which the judicial, as well as the other departments, hold their delegated trusts.

Basing a proposition on the penumbras of Amendments, rather than the amendments themselves, is not basing the decision on the Constitution.\n \n\n \n OK-- Article V:\n \n \nThe Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either Case, shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as part of this Constitution.\n\n \n So there you have it: AMENDMENTS ARE PART OF THE CONSTITUTION.\n \n \nSo, the Supreme Court rested its decision not on the 9th Amendment as the District Court had done, but chose instead to base it on the 14th Amendment.\n\n \n NO. The 14th Amendment applies the Constitution to states, and thus the 9th amendment decision was applied to state via the 14th.\n However this is an oxymoron, becaust the 9th Amendment reserved the rights OF the states! So using the 14th to apply the 9th, is basically the states retaining rights against THEMSELVES-- i.e. an oxymoron.\n \n This is the problem, in that the court has usurped complete authority over state sovereignty by construing the 9th amendment as pertaining to a wholistic population angle rather than as pertaining to EACH STATE; and by doing so, it construes English COMMON law, as superseding STATE statutes to the contrary.\n \n \nOr unless they just made it up, which is the route they chose.

The Court looked to British Common Law for that; therefore the court ruled that Common Law superseded state statutes, in applying Common Law definitions of liberty (and everything else, by logical conclusion).\n \n Here, the court claimed that \"The People,\" \"retained\" these rights under the 9th Amendment-- again, contruing \"The People\" to mean ALL persons of ALL states, as a single political group; however this completely IGNORES what I proved above, i.e. that this could pertain to the people of EACH STATE against the FEDERAL government, because there WERE no other \"People\" prior to the Constitution!\n \n However under the current Leviathan empire, the Supreme Court can make up anything it wants, being legally omnipotent-- no matter WHAT the Constitution says.

   "So there you have it: AMENDMENTS ARE PART OF THE CONSTITUTION.\n\n Try a little harder, Joel. Amendments are part of the Constitution. Penumbras are not part of the Constitution. Say it with me now: Amendments are part of the Constitution; penumbras are not part of the Constitution.\n \n \nNO. The 14th Amendment applies the Constitution to states, and thus the 9th amendment decision was applied to state via the 14th.\n\n A little advice for you: try reading the actual text of the case before commenting on it. I gave you a direct quote from the case where the Supreme Court explicitly rested its reasoning in Roe on the 14th Amendment. You saying that they did not is simply not correct. The Court did not merely use the incorporation doctrine; they used the substantive due process doctrine.\n \n Additionally, the majority in Griswold, the case establishing the right of privacy, did not rest its reasoning on the 9th Amendment, but on the penumbras of a collection of amendments. And to repeat, these penumbras are not the Constitution themselves, even though the Amendments are.\n \n \nThis is the problem, in that the court has usurped complete authority over state sovereignty by construing the 9th amendment as pertaining to a wholistic population angle rather than as pertaining to EACH STATE; and by doing so, it construes English COMMON law, as superseding STATE statutes to the contrary.\n\n Yet, surprisingly, the Supreme Court has not used the 9th Amendment very much. You are wrong that they used it in Griswold, and you are wrong that they used it in Roe. Therefore, to advance your hypothesis (which in principle is correct), you need to find some other cases, or make different arguments.\n \n \nBingo-- and thus without state sovereignty, the Supreme Court is Law: hence Madison's warning that it would spell the end of Freedom.\n\n And it was not the 9th Amendment that the court has used to accomplish this. Rather, it is the 14th through various illegitimate legal doctrines such as incorporation and substantive due process.\n \n \nAgain, the 14th Amendment just keeps any state from depriving anyone of liberty-- it doesn't DEFINE that liberty.\n\n But my point is that the Supreme Court has disagreed. Hence the illegitimate legal doctrine of substantive due process, which maintains that the due process clause can be violated even in cases where due process has been given.\n \n \nThe Court looked to British Common Law for that; therefore the court ruled that Common Law superseded state statutes, in applying Common Law definitions of liberty (and everything else, by logical conclusion).\n\n The Court used common law to construe the term \"person.\" It used the 14th Amendment to overturn abortion statutes.\n \n \nHere, the court claimed that \"The People,\" \"retained\" these rights under the 9th Amendment-- again, contruing \"The People\" to mean ALL persons of ALL states, as a single political group; however this completely IGNORES what I proved above, i.e. that this could pertain to the people of EACH STATE against the FEDERAL government, because there WERE no other \"People\" prior to the Constitution!\n\n The 9th Amendment clearly means that the fact that specific rights are enumerated in the Constitution does not mean that other rights were not retained by the people through their legislative processes, which is exactly why the Supreme Court has declined to use it to do what you have said it did.\n \n \nHowever under the current Leviathan empire, the Supreme Court can make up anything it wants, being legally omnipotent-- no matter WHAT the Constitution says. This is why Madison warned this would happen, if the states could not supersede the federal government (Virginia Resolutions).\n\n I would say that you are on the right track, but that some of your facts are not accurate.

   "Here's Joel Henderson unedited from Post #14 on the \"Holo-Myth\" thread in the \"History\" forum. It might just shed some light on his biases:\n \n The issue is not the accuracy of the claims, but the right to QUESTION them; without that right, then it is state-dogma which one may NOT fail to accept under penalty of law.\n And here again, my karma runs over your dogma, in that poetic justice applies in the form of backlash against forced belief-systems-- and people getting tired of Jews and others trying to ramrod beliefs down their throats at state gunpoint; what's wrong for the goose-stepper, is wrong for those who won't let others take a GANDER.\n Here we say \"I'm from Missouri\" to express skepticism; but it seems that one had at least better be in SOME Union-state if they do so regarding the claims of God's Self-Chosen People with strong political connections.\n \n Rather, it's clear that there's an extreme cover-up going on, if they want to silence all scrutiny-- just like no professional legal scholar will dare critique Lincoln's legal methods, because they don't want to end up in soup-lines, since the federal government carefully guards the illegal nature of national authority against discovery; here, they clearly want to bury the evidence, because it will ruin their story if the truth gets out: i.e. that Hitler represented the global majority, not some freak example of ultimate evil with no rational explanation, but the inevitable political causation of systematized global corruption under statism.\n And here, the elite simply don't want their lies questioned, any more than the Roman Cathlic church wanted Copernicus questioning THEIR dogma concerning the world's history and structure.\n \n Finally, one would be hard-pressed to explain why 6 million Jews killed by one group of socialists, are not only more important than 100+ million (assumed) Gentiles people killed by other socialists, but so MUCH more important as to warrant such forced beliefs (since \"denial\" is here defined as mere indication of a failure to accept and BELIEVE it)-- particularly when no living person's RIGHTS are threatned by such denial; rather, it's clear that the DEAD have more rights than the living!\n What we clearly have here, then, is not a mere conspiracy, but a vast political MACHINE at work: a tool of the Leviathan juggernaut, where people are not permitted to judge the facts for themselves, but must kowtow to the truth dictated thereby.\n And that machine is the state power elite that governs the world.\n \n ",

That is terribly annoying, and absolutely unnecessary.\n \n Second of all, the point is this: the right to regulate abortion is a right that might very well be retained by the people. Because the 9th Amendment says that the fact that certain rights have been enumerated in the Constitution cannot be used to deny others retained by the people (the right to regulate abortion, for instance), the court did not use the 9th Amendment in Roe to reverse abortion statutes.\n \n What the 9th Amendment does not mean is that those various rights retained by the people are protected by the Federal Constitution. Rather, they are retained through the principle of federalism, whereby each state had its own laws protecting and securing additional rights not protected or secured by the Federal Constitution.",

That is terribly annoying, and absolutely unnecessary.\n \n Second of all, the point is this: the right to regulate abortion is a right that might very well be retained by the people. \n\n \n Again, it comes down to defining the term \"the people;\" because that defines what rights are RETAINED by such.\n \n The Constitution defines it as the people of the individual states respectively, in their highest sovereign capacity-- i.e. each state is a sovereign nation, which simply delegated (i.e. SUBORDINATED) certain tasks to the fed by voluntary agreement; therefore each state has the right to defend life as it defines it.\n \n Meanwhile the Supreme Court, following the Lincolnian Jihad and Texas v. White, construes \"the People\" to mean those of the UNION, vs. those of the individual states.\n \n If you can't get past that hurdle, you're out of the race.\n \n Now again, even the Lincolnites now admit that each state was sovereign through its people at least prior to the Constitution, while likewise each state was 100% independent from Great Britain-- therefore any rights \"retained by the people\" under the 9th amendment, could ONLY have been \"the people\" of the individual states--- not \"of the Union,\" not of British Commoners-- but of THE STATES, RESPECTIVELY.\n Likewise, by definition, they couldn't have \"retained\" rights against THEMSELVES; therefore the 9th Amendment CANNOT apply to state statutes, but ONLY FEDERAL statutes.\n \n What's so hard to understand about that-- other than that we live under an illegal dictatorship that exists via long-standing totalitarian suppression of the truth, through under an imperial coup d'etat which was effected under the false cloak of legality?\n (I think I just answered my own question-- but ignorance of the law is NEVER an excuse).",
