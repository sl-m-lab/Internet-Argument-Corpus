   "http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/02/washington/02mass.html\n \n October 2, 2006\n Archbishop's Call for Court Blessing Steers Clear of Issues \n By NEELA BANERJEE\n WASHINGTON, Oct. 1 - Speaking to Supreme Court justices, cabinet members, politicians and hundreds of judges and lawyers gathered here on Sunday to celebrate a special Mass marking the start of the judicial calendar, Archbishop Donald W. Wuerl of Washington rejoiced in what he called the resurgence of faith in the shaping of public policy and urged those before him to remain rooted in their religion.\n \n \"What we do and how we act, our morals and ethics, follow on what be believe,\" Archbishop Wuerl told a standing-room crowd at the Roman Catholic Cathedral of St. Matthew downtown. \"The religious convictions of a people sustain their moral decisions.\"\n \n Officially called the Solemn Votive Mass of the Holy Spirit, \"votive\" indicating that it is being celebrated for a particular intention, Red Masses are held all over the country, typically at the start of a judicial year. The Supreme Court's new term begins Monday.\n \n Worshipers ask for the blessing of the Holy Spirit on those who administer justice, in a tradition that goes back to 13th-century Europe. The service is called the Red Mass because of the red vestments clergy members wear. \n \n This year, the Mass was celebrated by the new leader of the Washington Archdiocese, Archbishop Wuerl, to bless a Supreme Court that has a Catholic majority for the first time. The five Catholics on the court are Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, Antonin Scalia and Samuel A. Alito Jr. \n \n All but Justice Alito were in attendance Sunday, as were Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales; several other cabinet members; Mayor Anthony A. Williams; and Lt. Gov. Michael Steele of Maryland, a Republican candidate for the Senate.\n \n Many non-Catholics attend Red Masses, as a sign of respect. Last year, President Bush came; generally, presidents attend at least one during their terms.\n \n A procession of priests and bishops was followed by a police color guard. A Ralph Vaughan Williams hymn was followed by the national anthem. \n \n Having earned a reputation as a skilled diplomat in his previous tenure as bishop of Pittsburgh, Archbishop Wuerl did not overtly talk about issues the church has championed, like prohibiting abortion, although the court this session will review the constitutionality of a ban on a type of late-term abortion. \n \n Instead, he said the values formed by religion could not be separated from the insight and judgment brought to bear on law and policy. \n \n \"The two spheres, church and state, while distinct, are always interrelated,\" Archbishop Wuerl told the worshipers. \"Politics, law, faith are mingled because believers are also citizens. Church and state are home for the same people.\"\n \n For those who may have been looking for some clue to the archbishop's approach to political issues, he strode the range of Catholic social teaching without focusing on a particular topic, as he called for \"speaking out against racial discrimination, social injustice or threats to the dignity of life.\" \n \n Advocates on the right and the left have said that, historically, personal religious beliefs have not necessarily directed the way justices vote on a case. But when Justice Alito was confirmed in January, the news media and others noted the Catholic majority on the court. \n \n Few may have raised the issue of the justices' religion if they had all been Methodist, for instance, said John H. Garvey, dean of Boston College Law School, in a telephone interview. But Mr. Garvey said it was valid to discuss the religious composition of the court because some people would assume the justices voted a particular way because of their Catholic faith.\n \n \"They are not a voting bloc,\" Mr. Garvey said. \"The Catholic Church is a very big tent with people from the far left and the far right in it. The fact that the Catholic members of the court are center-to-right rather than center-to-left says more about President Bush than about the Catholic Church.\"\n \n Lucia A. Silecchia, professor of law at Catholic University of America in Washington, said it was too soon to tell whether the Catholic justices held common views. \"Where it gets complicated is that all five identify themselves as Catholic, but they aren't necessarily consistent with one another,\" Professor Silecchia said.\n \n The Mass ended with \"America the Beautiful\" and the hymn \"O God Beyond All Praising.\" The archbishop descended the altar and left smiling and chatting with Chief Justice Roberts. \n \n Later, on the steps of the cathedral, two young men approached Archbishop Wuerl to have him bless their rosaries and to take pictures with him. \n \n As the archbishop stood with one man, the other, holding the camera, said happily, \"Here's to the union of church and state!\"\n \n The archbishop laughed, but gently corrected him. \"No,\" he said, \"remember, I said they were two distinct spheres.\"",

More like 24.5%, which is roughly about 1/3 of those claiming to be christian.\n \nSeperation of Church and state (a catholic belief) has been twisted to mean catholics cant be in public office unless they ignore there own beliefs...\nDid you mean \"separation?\" Actually, separation of church and state isn't a catholic belief. Such an idea didn't exist through over 1700 years of \"Catholic\" christianity until the foundation of the U.S. The idea came from the philosophers of the enlightenment and the American Deists, like Jefferson, Washington, Madison, Franklin, Paine, etc. Isn't it bizarre how some 219 years after the drafting of the Constitution, which was opposed almost universally by christians, it is being clutched to the breast of modern christians. Every good idea is claimed to stem from christianity. The worst hypocrisy comes from the christian claims of the basis of the Declaration of Independence. It seems to be an example of how christian dogma has been changed by the deist humanism that inspired the foundations of this country. Just read the Declaration while trying to keep christian tenets in mind. Here let me get you started, \"We hold these truths to be self evident.\" Notice that truth isn't revealed in scripture but self evident. How utterly humanistic!\n \nChurch is seperate in that the state has no control over it, but the members of the church are also citizens of the united states who live in a free democratic society and should be able to run their own country according to their own morals if they are appointed or voted for.\nLopsided. The other side of the coin is that elected officials who try to uphold the Constitution do not attempt to impose religion on others. Elected officials can conduct themselves according to their religious morals as long as they do not attempt to impose those morals on others by law. Thankfully, we have the courts to strike down laws enacted by those who feel that they are able to impose their morals because they represent the majority. Thus, prayer and Bible reading in schools or at school events is unconstitutional. Monumental religious erections on public property (such as the Alabama Supreme Court building) are unconstitutional. The display of the Bible outside of the Federal Court in Houston is unconstitutional.\n \n Sadly, two of those \"Catholics\" on the Supreme Court (Thomas and Scalia) have been more than willing to allow the imposition of their religious dogma on others.",

We all knew what he meant...MOVE ON. :xcensored \n \n\n \" Actually, separation of church and state isn't a catholic belief. Such an idea didn't exist through over 1700 years of \"Catholic\" christianity until the foundation of the U.S. The idea came from the philosophers of the enlightenment and the American Deists, like Jefferson, Washington, Madison, Franklin, Paine, etc. Isn't it bizarre how some 219 years after the drafting of the Constitution, which was opposed almost universally by christians, it is being clutched to the breast of modern christians. Every good idea is claimed to stem from christianity. The worst hypocrisy comes from the christian claims of the basis of the Declaration of Independence. It seems to be an example of how christian dogma has been changed by the deist humanism that inspired the foundations of this country. Just read the Declaration while trying to keep christian tenets in mind. Here let me get you started, \"We hold these truths to be self evident.\" Notice that truth isn't revealed in scripture but self evident. How utterly humanistic!\n\n Why not read all of the relevent passages?\n \n\n WHEN, in the Course of human Events, it becomes necessary for one People to dissolve the Political Bands, which have connected them with another, and to assume, among the Powers of the Earth, the separate and equal Station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's GOD entitle them, a decent Respect to the Opinions of Mankind requires that they should declare the Causes which impel them to the Separation. \n \n We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed, by their CREATOR, with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.\n ..........\n And for the Support of this Declaration, with a firm Reliance on the Protection of DIVINE PROVIDENCE, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honour. \n \n\n Interesting. A \"humanist document\" that calls for the protection of \"Divine Providence\", endowed with rights by their \"Creator\" and empowerment based on \"Nature's God\" . emoticon_confused \n \n\n Lopsided. The other side of the coin is that elected officials who try to uphold the Constitution do not attempt to impose religion on others. Elected officials can conduct themselves according to their religious morals as long as they do not attempt to impose those morals on others by law. Thankfully, we have the courts to strike down laws enacted by those who feel that they are able to impose their morals because they represent the majority. Thus, prayer and Bible reading in schools or at school events is unconstitutional. Monumental religious erections on public property (such as the Alabama Supreme Court building) are unconstitutional. The display of the Bible outside of the Federal Court in Houston is unconstitutional.\n\n Explain \"Blue Laws\", which have been upheld by the Supreme Court many times, in light of your above assertion. emoticon_confused \n \n\n Sadly, two of those \"Catholics\" on the Supreme Court (Thomas and Scalia) have been more than willing to allow the imposition of their religious dogma on others.\n\n \n That's YOUR interpretation of it, not mine. I see Thomas and Scalia as being defenders of Congress' rights to make law and the rights of the people to influence those laws. \n \n Oh, and before I forget. Jesus said \"\"Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's.\" This was the first instance of separation of Church and state. And since Catholicism is the most linearly traceable religion back to Christ, it's accurate to call it a Catholic belief.",

It reflected an increasingly common division in death penalty cases between the court's conservative and liberal blocs.\n \n Justice Anthony Kennedy, who was part of the majority, said it was implausible to conclude that jurors failed to take all the evidence into account before settling on a sentence of death.\n \n Mr. Belmontes beat Steacy McConnell to death with a dumbbell bar in the burglary of her Victor, Calif., home in 1981. He was convicted of the crime and sentenced to death, a decision upheld by state courts and a federal judge. The 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, however, twice commuted the sentence. The second time was after the Supreme Court told it to reconsider Mr. Belmontes's sentence under a decision that restored the death penalty in another California murder case.\n \n The appeals court said the trial judge misled jurors about whether they could consider the prospect that Mr. Belmontes could live a productive life behind bars based on his good behavior during an earlier commitment to a California correctional facility for youth.\n \n \"It was mistaken...to find a 'reasonable probability' that the jury did not consider respondent's future potential,\" Justice Kennedy wrote in his majority opinion. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas joined Justice Kennedy's opinion.\n \n In his dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens said the majority opinion reaches a \"strange conclusion\" based upon speculation. \"I simply cannot believe that the jurors took it upon themselves to consider testimony they were all but told they were forbidden from considering,\" Justice Stevens said, also writing for Justices Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and David Souter.\nWasn't the late Pope John Paul II, now headed for sainthood, opposed to the death penalty?",

   "http://www.dailykos.com/story/2004/8/28/154043/126\n \n His mocking of Karla Faye came during an interview by Tucker Carlson for Talk magazine, in 1999. It was in response to Carlson asking him for his impressions regarding Karla Faye's interview on the Larry King show, prior to her execution.\n \n\"He (Larry King) asked her real difficult questions, like, `What would you say to Governor Bush?'\" \n \"What was her answer?\" I (Tucker Carlson) wonder.\n \n \"`Please,' Bush whimpers, his lips pursed in mock desperation, `don't kill me.'\"\n \n I must look shocked - ridiculing the pleas of a condemned prisoner who has since been executed seems odd and cruel, even for someone as militantly anti-crime as Bush - because he immediately stops smirking. \"It's tough stuff,\" Bush says, suddenly somber, \"but my job is to enforce the law.\" \nBut most interestingly (I didn't know this), Carlson continues in the article...\n \nAs it turns out, the Larry King-Karla Tucker exchange Bush recounted never took place, at least not on television. During her interview with King, however, Tucker did imply that Bush was succumbing to election-year pressure from pro-death penalty voters. Apparently Bush never forgot it. He has a long memory for slights.\n",
