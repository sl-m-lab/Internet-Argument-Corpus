A man is continually generating sperm throughout much of his life and so many will be ensouled in America if he is living there, citizen or not (I am assuming we are speaking of America). America gives citizenship to any baby born there, and there is such thing as duel citizenship (being citizens of different countries). \n \n You are worried that the progenitors will act against the cells interests? Irrelevent, really. We give next-of-kin power to make decisions for those in comas and unable to make decisions for themselves. The progenitor is the only one who should have the authority to make decisions for the reproductive cells.

Sperm, at least, absolutely will not survive long no matter what kind of care they are given. Since rights are being reworked to include them I believe they should be given special dispensation for those that are dependent on how long one lives. Since they are physically unable to imbibe alcohol and have no appendages to fire weapons, they would be unable to utilize those rights while still retaining them.

If you, for example, suddenly fall into a coma your next-of-kin would decide whether or not you remain on life-support unless you make other arrangements (such as a will). Progenitors should have the same power to make decisions with the added responsibility of voting in these citizen's stead.\n \n \n\n They do though, some are born so small and weak they can't live very long.\n\n \n And some full term babies are born so small and weak that they cannot live very long as well. However, both pre-term and full-term babies, as a group, have the same life-expectancy, that of 80 some-odd years.

However, these aliens only lived 10 years and matured to be fully adult in 5 years. We may adjust the voting age for these aliens to 5 years old because they, as a group, do not live as long as we do. Yes, there are other differences, but maybe this will help you understand the difference between a group and individual circumstances.\n \n Sperm, as a group, will not survive. That is why they should have special dispensation with voting rights. The fact that individual people do not live very long is irrelevant. As a group, people live 80 some-odd years.\n \n \n\n They wouldn't want that because it's something, and they don't want anything.\n\n \n In fact, even stating that they don't want anything is misleading. The very concept of \"want\" is empty when applying it to sperm and eggs. This is irrelevant, they are citizens and they deserve rights just like everyone else.\n \n \n\n The people will have to vote to save the oocytes, so we would have to move slowly in building oocyte rights, or they won't vote.
