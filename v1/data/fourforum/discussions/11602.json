She takes a quick look into the mirror and hands it to the cop.\n \n The cop also takes a quick into the mirror and hands it back saying, \"Oh, I'm sorry for stopping you, I didn't realise you were a cop.

   "The real intellects want to know \"does the carpet match the drapes?\" ;)\n\n \n Lol! Those intellects are always left wondering, never knowing.\n \n This is my favorite blonde joke;\n \n An attractive blonde woman boards a plane headed for New York. Just as she takes a seat in first class an air hostess asks to see her ticket. The air hostess notices the woman has only purchased an economy seat\n \"I'm sorry Miss but your sitting in the wrong section, your ticket is in economy class not first class\"\n The blonde woman pipes up with \"I'm young, I'm blonde and I'm beautiful! I'm sitting here, first class all the way to New York, and, there's not a damn thing you can do about it\"\n Not wanting to argue, the air hostess moves on to find the supervisor to handle the situation. Soon there is a supervisor standing in front of the blonde woman once again requesting she move to the economy seat. The blonde replies, \"I'm young, I'm blonde and I'm beautiful! I'm sitting here, first class all the way to New York, and, there's not a damn thing you can do about it\"\n The supervisor walks off and enters the cockpit, \"Sorry, but we seem to have an issue with a passenger in first class, a young blonde woman with an economy ticket is refusing to move out of a first class seat\".\n The Captain smiles \"Don't worry, i will take care of this\"\n The Captain walks into first class and over to the blonde woman, he bends over and whispers in her ear. The blonde woman jumps up quickly exclaiming \"Oh gosh I'm so embarrassed, i will move right away\"\n As the blonde woman wanders of to take her seat in economy the supervisor confronts the Captain \"What did you say to get her to move?\"\n The Captain grins, \"It was easy, i told her first class wasn't going to New York\".",
