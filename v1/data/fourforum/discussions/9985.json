   "I found a good article from the Economist which outlines the trends and causes of lower fertility in many European countries:\n http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9334869\n \n With respect to Muslim immigrants, it says:\n \nFrance is one of three EU countries with a fertility rate above the magic replacement level (Denmark and Ireland are the others). It is natural to assume that this is because France also has many Muslim immigrants and Muslims have large families. Because France does not collect official statistics by religion, it is hard to know whether that assumption is accurate. But the country does register the birthplace of parents, so that one can calculate the family size of immigrants; and on the face of it, a study by Laurent Toulemon of the Institut national d'\u00e9tudes d\u00e9mographiques appears to confirm the assumption. He found that immigrant women do indeed have high fertility: 2.5 compared with 1.65 for French-born women. But because immigrants make up only one-twelfth of women of childbearing age, this raises the national fertility rate only slightly.\n \n However, Mr Toulemon also found that immigrants have a peculiar demographic profile: they are much more likely to have a baby during the first year or two after arriving in France than later. Young women, it seems, are waiting to conceive until they get to France. If you adjust their lifetime fertility rate to take account of this bulge of babies on arrival, you find immigrant fertility is about 2.2, not much above average. Immigrants are not pushing up the birth rate as much as they seem to be. \n\n \n It also notes:\n \nAll this is a world away from the other rich country with demographic growth: America. Much American debate focuses on the role of marriage and the traditional family in fostering a healthy society. In Europe, by contrast, only countries with many births outside wedlock and with high female participation rates have reasonably high birth rates. Those that have sought to maintain traditional family ties have seen fertility collapse.\n\n \n Overall, the article analyzes statistics which show that those European countries that have more liberal policies toward working mothers - support for parental leave, availability of day care, etc. - have higher fertility rates than those that try to push traditional family values and do not give working mothers the support they need.",

I do believe that, like us, most common Muslim folks would simply like to be left to live their lives. \n\n Muslims do view America as a rich country and a country of opportunity. There are just a wide variety of views about how the US views Islam. Most well educated Muslims that I have met share their less-educated members views against US support of Israel and against the US incursion into Iraq - or at least against the way it was handled - but certainly do not think that the US is out to destroy Islam in totality. However, Muslims in general hold a wide range of views about the US - many quite extreme. Unfortunately, in the Middle East, the press is not truly free so people are far more open to trusting rumor and conspiracy theories. From what I am told, that helps feed the anti-American feelings. Essentially, though there have been actions we have taken which could justifiably be criticized by Muslims of the Middle East, many - particularly the extremists - vastly exaggerate and distort our actions to make us appear to have evil purposes - thus justifying their terrorist actions in their minds. I don't think there are too many things that we can say or do to prove them wrong - we have no credibility in the Middle East.

However, Gallup adds credence in my view. \n I do not consider it feasible that 1002 people could possibly represent the ideas of 260 million accurately. \n\n That is why there is a 3% margin of error added. If the sample were truly random, then the science of statistics say that the margin of error is 1 / Sqrt (sample number ) = 3%. There is a legitimate point to be made that any type of survey on such issues is not 100% random since often those who will even answer surveys are those that have strong opinions to begin with (already a preselected portion of the population). Nevertheless, the fact is that the same poll (from the same specific group of polled people) said that they would outlaw second term abortions. This should show you how this is not a poll purposely skewed toward the pro-choice side, since the pro-choice side would have kept second trimester abortions also legal.\n \n2.

But, the discussion concerning polls are irrelevant to me. I cannot alter my feelings about stopping the slaughter on what even a majority believes. \n\n I agree with you that one's own opinions need not be directed by the majority opinion. On the occasions when I find my opinion not in the majority (or at least a large minority), then I do question whether there is something that I might be missing and look into the reasons why the majority hold their opinion and judge for myself based on those reasons. \n \n However, in a Democracy, we are ethically obligated to abide by the indirect decision of the majority (indirect since it is filtered by representatives, for better or worse), unless those decisions run counter to the Constitution. There are certainly majority decisions that I disagreed with but have to live with nonetheless. If one disagrees with the majority, then all one can do is to help contribute money or time toward convincing the majority of one's cause.\n \n2.

Many, indeed most, others hold a range of more progressive views. The Constitution is not clear on the subject of when human rights start but there is enough language referring to \"birth\" that that seems to be the official starting point. Also, Abortion was legal during the start of our country. On the other hand, the right to privacy is one that is contentious since it is only spelled out indirectly in the Constitution. The bottom line is that I accept that the Constitution is open to interpretation when it comes to abortion rights. \n \n3. Probably true considering that politicians are by nature pandering cowards. \n Controlled by fear. Their jobs being more important than any real issue that exposes their senses of right and wrong.\n\n I agree that politicians of today often do not vote based on well developed reasons but based on political expediency - a continued source of disappointment. I think that there are various factors from both sides stopping direct legislation about third trimester abortion:\n \n 1. Many on the pro-choice side are afraid of the slippery-slope and would be extremely careful about any language in third trimester abortion restrictions that could be used to open the possibility of restrictions in first and second trimester.\n \n 2. The pro-life side might view a ruling only restricting third trimester abortions as an acceptance of that as the limiting point, which would not be acceptable to them, so they might try to force language into the restriction that would try to push open the gate to first and second trimester restrictions.\n \n 3. The pro-life side might recognize that, if third trimester restrictions were implemented, then a main motivating factor for pro-life momentum (i.e. the sympathy toward late term fetuses) would no longer be relevant since that part would be solved. There might not be enough sympathy toward first and even second term fetuses to sustain further progress.\n \n So, there are legitimate concerns on both sides where third trimester restrictions are concerned. I continue to hope that some of these obstacles can be overcome, but I am not holding my breath.",

Unless one knows the denominator, the ratios are meaningless.\n \n All you need to is how many absolute live births are occurring in one group versus another (and I suppose you also need to consider the infant mortality rate alongside those numbers.) The decision to terminate a pregnancy has the same effect as birth control or abstinence. If one woman has 10 children and 10 abortions, she will end up with more children and a woman who has 2 children and no abortions. \n \n \n I am making no comment on anything but the math. All I am saying is the orginal article does not give enough information to conclude what the title of the thread states. The original article wasn't even discussing Arabs or Muslims, it was talking about immigrants.\n \n As previously stated, worst thread ever.",

In certain countries, women are overruled by law not to go out in public unattended, not to teach or have a job, and have no rights over their own body, but a man does. It's BS. \n \n The difference is, we are given a better sex ed than certain countries and that as women, it ISN'T our duty or only duty to be a baby machine. We are able to hold careers and be independent. (There are independent women within Arabic countries who are educated, who have careers of their own within these countries too, but they come from educated families and aren't as common place, perhaps.). I am not going to start having kids because of someone else's fear that we are being taken over by Islam. In fact there are many parallels between the fundamentalists there and the ones in the west. \n \n I, have been educated that I will have kids when I am damn well ready as a woman to take on that responsibility.
