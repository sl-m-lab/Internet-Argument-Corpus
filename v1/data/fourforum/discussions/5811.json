   "Errrr, I can't quite tell if this is a joke or not. I'm going to assume it isn't, but I'm going to feel really stupid if it is. \n \n Now, reanimating the dead just seems like a horribly bad idea to me. I know that everyone has at least one person they wish was still alive, myself included, but this just seems like going against a lot of ethics, not to mention that it is just creepy. I dont know about you, but zombies scare the shitou of me (which means I have an unnerving desire to watch zombie movies, and thus ruin my psyche even further). I know the dogs aren't slathering monsters loking for flesh to eat (well, the picture makesitlook like they are, but the aricle says differently), but the whole concept just smacks of potential armageddon. \n \n **Still hopng this isn't a joke and I don't look like an idiot**",
