That was a Government action which we the people decried as wrong and ill conceived. \n \n Except for you Leftists of course, you had no compunctions at all about blowing 700+ billion dollars twice for these bailouts which Government mismanagement caused in the first place. And now like the epic hypocrite that you are, you turn right around and blame we conservative americans as if we are behind every stupid decision the government makes. \n \n I can't wait for when the bottom falls out of our national economy due to this unholy healthcare fiasco to see how YOU personally come on here and blame me and all conservatives for it becoming a reality when it has been you defending, endorsing and promoting it for the past year and a half. After all, you make up your own reality as you float through a La La land of your own creation. emoticon_xdonno",

I am glad that the current legislation expands the safety net, because I know (unlike yourself in la la land) that real human beings' lives will be helped.

That's life, or death, for companies, as a matter of course.\n \n It's not America's job to keep them in business, one way or the other.\n \n We do need to provide for the health of all of our citizens, and we should work with the best of what we've already got, and improve on it from there.\n \n I am not into the Mandates and/or penalties. I support expanding the safety network, e.g. Medicaid, but they could do that without all the rest of the garbage, and coupled with mandates, it could become a much worse scenario for lower income Americans should they wish to drop Medicaid because Uncle Sam is such a p.i.t.a.\n \n In single payer, there's expansion of health care, but not at the expense of individual liberties. You can keep your insurance if you like it so much. (And you're all so healthy, so you wouldn't have any problems maintaining one another, right? And think of all the money saved gutting programs like Medicaid. Just open up Medicare for anyone. Do it through taxes.)\n \n \n ---------\n \n They worked in Switzerland, but they had about 95-98% of the population already voluntarily insured. And they voted on it in a referendum.",
