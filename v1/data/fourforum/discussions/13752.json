That and it doesn't pay that well, which again mitigates against the \"greed is good\" element of conservatism.\n\n \n Yes the teaching profession is more left wing not for the reason you think. Its bebause left wingers beget more left wingers. They delude the poor souls consigned or more accurately condemned to their ravings. Critical thinking and questiong attitudes are not found in the left winger's tools. When one embraces moral relativism there is no room for critical thinking as every thing is relative to the situation. No teaching is a safe cushy job protected by tenure and unions so only in the extreme cases of malfeasance can they be terminated. A leftist can no more understand public service than a caveman can understand astro physics. Evidently you have no idea of the pay scales the teachers unions have squeezed out of the public trough.

Then being a leftist you don't deal in reality, only your own make believe fiction. \n \n \"While the firing is effective immediately, Churchill is entitled under Colorado regulations to receive one year's salary, which for him is just under $100,000.\" I would hardly call that not paying well. \n News: Ward Churchill Fired - Inside Higher Ed",

   "Most (secondary) teachers in the UK didn't study education as their undergraduate subject. They studied their academic subject (Maths and Physics in my case) and did a postgraduate teaching qualification. I assure you that the requirements for my undergraduate degree were just as stringent as everyone elses. You can do undergraduate courses that include Qualified Teaching Status but you still (for secondary courses) spend most of your time studying your chosen subject. Entry requirements for courses vary enormously regardless of subject.

Of my friends who trained to be a teachers (many of them with Masters degrees in their chosen subjects), I'm the only one who is currently in a teaching post. It's a tough job.
