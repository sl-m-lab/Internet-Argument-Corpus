   "A BUZZFLASH EDITORIAL \n \n First, Let Us Share Damning Evidence Provided by a BuzzFlash Reader:\n \n Dear Buzz:\n \n Thanks for a great website...in addition to your excellent editorial about Condi the liar [LINK], here's an excerpt from a January 2003 USA Today magazine article written by John L. Scherer, entitled \"Is Terrorism's Threat Overblown?\" \n \n I disagree with his conclusions, however he does refer to several incidents I thought I remembered as well - that terrorists had already attempted to crash planes into buildings & monuments years before 9/11. \n \n Don't the Bushwackers read this sort of thing in their security briefings, or as I did in the papers, or is it that they can't retain anything they don't see on Fox News? \n \n Excerpt: \n \n \"Al Qaeda had planned attacks in London, Paris, Marseilles, Strasbourg, Singapore, and Rome, but most of the conspirators were arrested a short time after the Sept. 11 attacks. Meanwhile, no one had hijacked an aircraft in the U.S. using a \"real\" weapon in almost 15 years, although crashing planes into structures is not new. The Israelis shot down a Libyan jetliner they said was headed for a building in Tel Aviv in the 1980s. A Cessna 150 fell 50 yards short of the White House in September, 1994. French commandos prevented a jumbo jet, hijacked in Algeria by the Armed Islamic Group, from crashing into the Eiffel Tower the following December. In the mid 1990s, terrorist Ramzi Yousef plotted to have his friend Abdul Hakim Murad fly a light plane loaded with chemical weapons into CIA headquarters at Langley, Va., or to have him spray the area with poison gas. A Turkish hijacker attempted to crash an aircraft into the tomb of former Pres. Kemal Ataturk in Ankara in 1998. With enhanced security on at airports and passengers on commercial airliners who will react to any danger, this threat has diminished.\" [LINK] \n \n BuzzFlash Note: But even more damaging is this 2002 CBS News Article, \" Report Warned Of Suicide Hijackings\" [LINK]\n \n \"(CBS) Two years before the Sept. 11 attacks, an analysis prepared for U.S. intelligence warned that Osama bin Laden's terrorists could hijack an airliner and fly it into government buildings like the Pentagon. \n \n \"Suicide bomber(s) belonging to al Qaeda's Martyrdom Battalion could crash-land an aircraft packed with high explosives (C-4 and semtex) into the Pentagon, the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), or the White House,\" the September 1999 report said. \n \n The Bush administration has asserted that no one in government had envisioned a suicide hijacking before it happened. \n \n \"Had I known that the enemy was going to use airplanes to kill on that fateful morning, I would have done everything in my power to protect the American people,\" Mr. Bush told U.S. Air Force Academy football team members who were visiting the White House on Friday. It was his first public comment on revelations this week that he was told Aug. 6 that bin Laden wanted to hijack planes. \n \n CBS Senior White House Correspondent Bob Schieffer reports that other top officials were less forthcoming. The usually talkative Attorney General John Ashcroft just stared when reporters asked him about the terror warnings. FBI Chief Robert Mueller also refused to comment. \n \n White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said the administration was aware of the 1999 report prepared by the Library of Congress for the National Intelligence Council, which advises the president and U.S. intelligence on emerging threats. He said the document did not contain direct intelligence pointing toward a specific plot but rather included assessments about how terrorists might strike. \n \n \"What it shows is that this information that was out there did not raise enough alarm with anybody,\" Fleischer acknowledged. \n \n Bush, Powell and Rumsfeld have been using carefully crafted \"legal\" statements this week in which they say that had they known planes were to be hijacked and flown SPECIFICALLY into the World Trade Center Towers and the Pentagon, they would have taken steps to prevent the incidents. It takes an idiot not to see that they are \"protecting\" themselves from being charged with lying. Lying about what? Claiming that they were not warned about potential imminent hijackings and use of planes as assault weapons in general.\n \n They knew and did nothing. \n \n This is not speculation. This is fact.\n \n They are condemned by their own words.\n \n We don't need a 9/11 Commission.\n \n The truth about the Bush Administration ignoring blatant warnings about an imminent Al-Qaeda attack are already on the record.\n \n To boot, a phalanx of whistleblowers have outed their lies. The only response that the Bush administration has had to the truth is to attack the characters of the truth tellers. They can't refute what these patriots have to say. Because most of it, except for a few salacious details, is on the record. The Bush Cartel has revealed most of the condemning facts, inadvertently, by itself.\n \n One more time then. In August of 2001, after putting the fight against terrorism on the back burner, after being warned by Clinton experts about the danger of Osama, after ignoring the Hart-Rudman report on the urgent need to combat terrorism[LINK], after delegating the formulation of a plan to fight terror to Dick Cheney (who was too busy conducting his secret energy meetings with energy company execs and lobbyists, meetings that included an examination of Iraq's oil fields), after receiving a briefing that alerted him to likely imminent Al-Qaeda hijackings, Bush did nothing: NOTHING! [LINK],\n \n Now, the 9/11 Commission is poised to let Rice get off without testifying publicly under oath -- and the Chairman of the 9/11 Commission can only review the records of the infamous August 2001 warning to Bush while under guard at the White House -- and he must leave any notes about the meeting in a safe at the White House!\n \n BuzzFlash prediction: The 9/11 Commission will end up concluding that BOTH Clinton and Bush could have done more, because the panel is split between Republicans and Democrats and that is the only \"political\" consensus that they will be able to reach. The ferociously partisan character assassination questioning of Richard Clarke by Republican panel members, including the former hack Illinois Governor Jim Thompson, indicates that even so-called \"moderate\" Republicans aren't going to let the truth and national security get in the way of protecting their boy-king incompetent, George W. Bush.\n \n The first crime was Antonin Scalia leading a Supreme Court coup to steal the 2000 election for George W. Bush; the second crime was the Bush Administration's dereliction of duty in not even TRYING to protect the people of America from 9/11; the third crime is that the 9/11 Commission is going to come up with a \"political compromise\" in its findings. \n \n BuzzFlash just interviewed John Dean about his new book, \"Worse Than Watergate.\" He argues that the Bush administration is the worst presidency he has seen at stonewalling, lying, and vindictiveness.\n \n John Dean should know. He was Nixon's legal counsel and informed Nixon that there \"was a cancer\" on his presidency in regards to what Dean was beginning to find out about Watergate at that time.\n \n Now it is worse; the Bush administration is a cancer upon America.\n \n And we are paying for it with our lives: first on 9/11 and now in Iraq.\n \n The truth is before the eyes of the 9/11 Commission. They could stop now and call no further witnesses.\n \n Bush and Dick Cheney failed America. \n \n They failed us because of incompetence, because of their obsession with Iraq. \n \n They failed us because they cannot govern a democracy. \n \n They failed us because in the Bush Cartel, ideology and hubris trump common sense facts and information.\n \n And now the 9/11 Commission is poised to fail us.\n \n It will be another crime against the nation.\n \n A BUZZFLASH EDITORIAL",

   "\"(CBS) Two years before the Sept. 11 attacks, an analysis prepared for U.S. intelligence warned that Osama bin Laden's terrorists could hijack an airliner and fly it into government buildings like the Pentagon. \n \n \n Hey guys...I must have been sleeping for the last 9 or 10 years, can anyone tell me who was in the White House 2 years before the 9/11 attacks? Did this president who was there immediately make a huge stink about it then and work to clamp down security measures at airports? Was it brought to public attention? \n \n Clinton was in office for 8 years prior to 9/11. The intel was there about the terrorists then. Bush was in office for 8 months, and had access to the same intel. Don't turn it into a partisan argument, both parties did nothing extraordinary to stop it. I really don't see how anyone in government can sit back and point the finger of blame now, it seems that we as a nation were wholey unprepared. Both administrations dropped the ball, but seriously, if some people had specific intel about what was going to happen and kept their mouth shut, then they are more to blame than anyone else. If anyone wants to assert so forcefully that they knew what was going to happen, they should have been jumping up and down on national television warning Americans what was going to happen, perhaps we would have been more prepared then. \n \n And let's also try to keep our eye on the ball here: who was responsible for 9/11? THE TERRORISTS. It seems that everyone forgot all about them huh? Perhaps instead of looking for who to blame here, we should keep in mind that we were all attacked, and our government as a whole dropped the ball. The important thing is what can we do to prevent this from happening in the future. That is the one area where Bush has vastly outpaced Clinton.",
