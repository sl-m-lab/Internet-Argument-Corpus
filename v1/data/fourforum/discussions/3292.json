Also the testimonts only say just what is needed and no detail. For examle: When Moses brought down the Ten Commandments, they weren't arched like that. They were rectangular shaped.

The authors of the day had no access to carbon dating and such scientific tools as we do.\n\n \n I think the problem with many religions today is that they cling to the \"literality\" of the Bible by faith and reject the knowledge that science has uncovered. But consider civilization as it was when the Book of Genesis was written. They did not have the knowledge we have today to explain the nature of the universe. They tried of explain it to themselve in terms they could comprehend. What they could not comprehend, they contributed to the supernatural: \"God\".\n \n Take the concept of \"time\". I believe for them, their basic measurement was a \"day\", from one sunrise to the next. I don't think they have any concept of a \"second\" or a \"minute\" or an \"hour\" as we do today. These divisions of time into 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes to an hour, and 60 seconds to a minute were an arbitrary system later developed by man himself when he had a more accurate means of measuring time (the sundial, hour glass. marks on a burning candle). A year was measured by the passing of the four seasons, not by the time it took the earth to make one orbit around the sun. I don't think they could even begin to grasp the idea of millions of years. It was simply beyond their ability and knowledge.\n \n On the whole, I do not think the Bible is a bad book, if it is accepted as nothing more than a history of life and customs of those times in which it was written. It teaches many good concepts on how mankind should conduct themselves in their dealings with other men (and women). Aesop's (spelling?) fables do a similar service in their morals taught by their imaginary tales.\n \n I think the failing of the religions which are based on the roots in the Old Testement (Islam, Judism, Christianity) lies in their befief in the Bible as the immutable work of a supernatural power and their unwillingness to accept the body of knowledge now known within a reasonable framework for their religion. Evolution versus creationism is an example of this. I would personally find it much more realistic if they accepted evolution as a natural order guided by whatever intelligent force created order within the universe.\n \n I also find it extremely disturbing that so many of the traditional religions unbendingly profess to believe in the literality of the Bible and claim that they in no way interpret it, are in fact, the biggest hypocrits of all. They pick and chose from the Bible like an ala carte menu; which scriptures they wish to apply under what circumstances. From a book that, at it's root, teaches humility, tolerance, and love, they arrogantly preach intolerance and hatred. When challanged on the points of their hypocracy based on their supposed literal belief of the Bible, they respond with: \"But that's not what it means\", and then, with a straight face, deny that they in any way interpret the Bible. Any attempt at debate with them is futile. In their minds, they are right and you are wrong. QED. Period. End of dabate.\n \n Many, many scientist are deeply religious individuals. They stand in awe at the complexity of the universe in all it's order, chaos, and grandeur.

   "I think the problem with many religions today is that they cling to the \"literality\" of the Bible by faith and reject the knowledge that science has uncovered. But consider civilization as it was when the Book of Genesis was written. They did not have the knowledge we have today to explain the nature of the universe. They tried of explain it to themselve in terms they could comprehend. What they could not comprehend, they contributed to the supernatural: \"God\".\n\n and because science has discovered the logical and natural explanations for the phenomenon man once considered \"supernatural\", we know that it was not \"God\", but a natural phenomenon. there is possibly no physically observable phenomenon that science cannot provide a reasonable explanation for. nothing is supernatural. nothing is an \"act of God\"\n \nOn the whole, I do not think the Bible is a bad book, if it is accepted as nothing more than a history of life and customs of those times in which it was written. It teaches many good concepts on how mankind should conduct themselves in their dealings with other men (and women). Aesop's (spelling?) fables do a similar service in their morals taught by their imaginary tales.\n\n and like you said, the problem begins when we start taking the content of the bible as a literal recording of events, or a practical tool for how we should live today. the lessons in themselves are fine, but dont expect the events around the stories to have any basis in fact.\n \n \nI think the failing of the religions which are based on the roots in the Old Testement (Islam, Judism, Christianity) lies in their befief in the Bible as the immutable work of a supernatural power and their unwillingness to accept the body of knowledge now known within a reasonable framework for their religion.
