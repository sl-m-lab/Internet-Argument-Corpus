   "Actually all economists are ###### and this should be highlighted. It seems the goals of economists, in part, are to figure out exactly how the economy works so they can control it...or rather have government control it. If this is true than what a faulty way to look at things. For example Keynes says x,y,z (I don't feel like typing it out) therefore we should rack up deficit government spending during a recession. Of course this assumes you can change what naturally occurs and history has proven that is an idiotic concept. It would be like a weatherman knowing a hurricane is coming and proposing to build a big wall to stop it. \n \n Of course the information can be used to predict events and you can prepare for something. The problem with this is that we have numerous economic theories with nobody agreeing on what is correct. So doesn't this make economists worthless? To use the weatherman example again it would be like one weatherman saying it would be cloudy every day of the year and the other saying it would sunny every day of the year. Well both are going to be right sometimes. \n \n Finally, very few truths exist in terms of money/economy. Things like you can't keep adding on debt and expect to be ok. But things that drive supply or demand or an economy....yeah, none of those are really known.",
