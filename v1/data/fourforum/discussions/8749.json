   "Disturbances in France, and explosions in Spain and London, and permanent terrorist threat hanging over Europe... What a nice list of closely related to al-Qaeda Chechen extremist organizations' doings. And how do they get into Europe? - that's the question.\n There is the only country welcoming Chechens and bordering upon EU. That's Georgia. And terrorists are flowing through it into Turkey.\n Such thing happens because of their president Saakashvili. This loony guy hob-nobs with all Chechen militant leaders and readily gives them asylum. He also keeps training camps for those militants on Georgian territory and supplies them with false Georgian documents and weapons.\n No wonder that through Saakashvili's \"philanthropic\" activity Georgia has image of Islam terrorism supporter. Chechen criminals are walking freely on the Georgian territory and they are getting everything they need on demand.\n So Europe has extremist country headed by crazy dictator just hard by. I think that EU has enough power for removing him and placing him by more sensible and honest man.",
