   "From a letter in today's Wall Street Journal:\n \n \nHindus in U.S. Exemplify Capitalism's Basic Virtue\n Francis Fukuyama's formulation of the fundamental criteria of citizenship in European nations -- \"blood, soil and ancient shared memory\" -- captures perfectly the fatal flaw at the heart of European multiculturalism, and reveals the hypocrisy of the European contempt for the American experience (\"A Year of Living Dangerously,\" editorial page, Nov. 2). Critically, what is missing from that formulation, and from Prof. Fukuyama's prescription for cure, is the role of capitalism, and the worship of the almighty dollar.\n \n As Hayek and his disciples have pointed out, capitalism is the most democratic and virtuous of social systems: dollars are not black, white or red. And a society that accords social and cultural respect to those who succeed in the economic sphere is, by definition, more inclusive than one based on any other set of criteria.\n \n Let's take a really (one would think) remote cultural group in America: Hindus. Something like 40% of hotel/motel properties in America are owned by Patels and their cousins. And they contribute to American society at every level: philanthropic, cultural and social -- because of the respect they are accorded for their economic success. One generation: from immigrant to university donor and honoree.\n \n But societies that place economic success well below \"blood, soil and ancient shared memory\" in their pantheon of virtues are fated to spend eternity trying to square the circle: integrating those who do not share in those historical criteria, and never will.\n \n Barry Augenbraun -- St. Petersburg, Fla.\nActually, one could also cite the success of Chinese merchants all over the world, South Korean capitalists in the U.S. and quite a number of other non-Europeans around the world.\n \n Do all of these groups hold values in common? Or, is there a distinct brand of Hindu capitalism as opposed to Chinese capitalism as opposed to South Korean capitalism? And, I'd better not slight the Japanese in this discussion.\n \n I'm not sure I approve of Hayek's take on capitalism, though.",

   "Let's not forget the astonishing success of the Haitian diaspora in this country, either. \n \n I took Hayek's point to be that in a capitalistic society, any individual's race, creed, color, religion, parentage or ethnic background are irrelevant to success. The only relevant characteristics are the individual's competence and willingness to work.",

   "I don`t think this is as much about capitalism as it is about holding economic success virtous. And I think the author has it backwards. It is not because europeans don`t place value in economic success (as in wealth) that give rise to segregation and racism in Europe. It is segregation and racism in europe that makes it harder for immigrants to achieve economic success (as in wealth).",
