True, many, if not the majority of people in marriages do not find a value or sancitity, but that does not mean it has none for all. True, many people do find value or sanctity, but that does not mean it has any for all. The sancitity and value of marriage is a case by case subject that cannot rationally apply to everyone.

It is meant to remind gays and lesbians that we have, and will fight back. The Stonewall riots were the first time that gays fought back against oppression. It started with a bunch of drag queens throwing bricks at the police. It was a way of saying we will not take this any longer. It is the picture of that that gays should remember today! It reminds us that will fought then and we will fight now, until we are no longer harrassed or denied rights based on perceived or real sexual orientation. I remind people again...gay right are not just for gays. They are for everyone. It is not about your real sexual orientation, it is what people percieve is your sexual orientation. 80% of those gay bashed are straight. Somebody thought they were gay. People who are fired from their jobs for being gay may in fact have been straight, someone thought they were gay!",
