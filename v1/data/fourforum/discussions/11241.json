And through that acceptance, they receive the indwelling of Gods Holy Spirit as evidence that they belong to God from that time on, and for all eternity. No amount of manipulation by men can cause that acceptance to happen in a person.\n\n \n I strongly disagree. Many Christians were raised Christian. This does not allow them to be \"receiving\" or have an \"open mind\", quite the opposite in fact. When we were young, our brains were like sponges, soaking up everything that was taught to us. If Christianity was what our brains \"soaked up\", then throughout life they usually believe that Christianity is actually the only religion, and that every other religion is \"fake\" or not real. This is the problem with religion. They claim to have \"accepted\" their religion through the holy spirit (or some other bogus entity), and that is why they believe as they do. Many times, this is not how it happens. They were taught this religion at a young age, and just like all other values and morals that were instilled in them, they think they're right.\n \n \n \nIf anything, manipulation and coercion can only embitter a person against God and His truth. True spirituality is a personal journey that must be sincerely sought to be attained.\n\n \n For something to be \"sought and attained\", it must be taught to you, and priests and nuns are usually very manipulative. I've only been to one church where the priest didn't try to indoctrinate me, and I've been to quite a few churches.\n \n And according to Christians, if you believe in any other religion you will be punished. How is that accepting Christianity on your own? That sounds an awful lot like God threatening to harm you if you do not believe as he wants you to believe.\n \n \n \n \nWho's they? There is only one Holy Spirit, and it is Jesus own spirit which He places within everyone who receives Him so we wont ever be alone.\n\n \n Woops, excuse me while I burn in hell for that.\n \n \n \nFor someone who claims to have escaped brainwashing you don't seem to have a clue about what the true Gospel represents.\n\n \n Au contraire, I have read the bible, and listened to preachers preach, and I've noticed that Christians like to pick and choose what parts of the bible to follow.
