Really at times one gets the impression Polish president is too much into those intrigues which are actually seldom bring any good for Poland but in some mysterious way favor USA. \n BTW there used to circulate rumors that two Lechs (Walensa and Kachinsky) fell out due to the latter's involvement into CIA affairs! Both guys could boast KGB background but Kachinsky as a double agent was too much for not so much sophisticated Walensa. He just couldn't dig into it. Smart and well educated Kachisky used both KGB and then CIA to jump higher into political power. \n I'd love to think his present courtesy with America is just this sort of case. Lech must be after some benefits for Poland. They say he's got huge sum of advanced money for hosting of elements of that much spoken about anti-missile American system. But then came the discouraging news. $40 mln was sent to Ukrainian president Yuschenko to survive hard time.

Only the Green party in this country has raised its voice against American deployment. And it seems only the Greens are fully representative of the people's interests in the Czech Republic!

   "Being friendly with USA comes too costly I should say!\n \n Americans put it plain for Poles. They suggested that both construction and maintenance of the American anti-missile system in Poland should be financed from Warsaw state coffins. It relates not only preparing of the site to start construction works but financial footage of the whole Polish project in general. Well, guarding of the facilities is to be paid from the Poland's defense agency's \"big\" pocket as well. On top of that the construction is meant as tax-free and road insurance of the American military men servicing it lays a burden exclusively on the Warsaw government. \n Thus the logic is obvious. Dividends will go to the higher-ups of the modern world while ordinary European tax payers will be left in the red as always.\n Amusingly, the outcome was predicted by independent experts at the very start of the negotiation process. But Poland and Czechia seemed to be firmly set to pay for safety (in view of the threats from God knows whom) following the example of Japan and South Korea, paying up to relevantly 75% and 50% of the total American bases' maintenance cost. \n In a nutshell, no matter how you slice it, anti-missile systems will ensure American security while Europe has to pay the bill.",

   "You know, I'm astonished at the fact that during an OSCE conference on combating discrimination and promoting mutual respect and understanding that took place in Bucharest early in June, the attendees discussed all sort of things except the flagrant current situation in Poland - this country gains the lead among European countries in violation of human rights in terms of anti-Semitism, racism, hatred to Moslems, xenophobia, homophobia, and discrimination against HIV-positive persons. This fact was evinced in Poland's country report on human rights practices-2006 released by US Department Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. Here I present you part of the report that has relevance to the subject. To put it short, there are quite a lot of people in Poland who suffer persecution - Jews, non-Europeans (Arabs, Moslems, Africans, Roma), persons of alternative sexuality and HIV-positive persons.\n \n \n Societal Abuses and Discrimination \n \n During the year there were reports of several serious anti-Semitic incidents and occasional desecrations of Jewish cemeteries by skinheads and other groups. The Jewish community was estimated at 20,000 to 30,000, including 2,500 registered members listed in the country's statistical yearbook. \n \n The country has made considerable progress in relations with its Jewish communities; however, its politics remained vulnerable to charges of extremism, intolerance, and anti-Semitism. During the year some Jewish leaders expressed concern over reduction of government funding for Holocaust education and the inclusion of two small political parties in the governing coalition, some of whose members have made anti-Semitic statements. \n \n In April and May there were two separate attacks on prominent rabbis in Warsaw. In the first incident, an unidentified assailant accosted Rabbi Shalom Stambler, head of the country's Chabad-Lubavitch community, in the foyer of his office building. The person shoved the rabbi and shouted anti-Semitic slurs in view of security guards, who did not intervene. \n \n On May 16, an antifascist activist was stabbed by skinheads in Warsaw after being targeted by a neo-Nazi website that promotes hatred of Jews and homosexuals. On May 27, the country's chief rabbi, Michael Schudrich, was attacked on a downtown Warsaw street. The assailant, who was apprehended in August, pushed the rabbi to the ground, sprayed him with pepper spray, and shouted an anti-Semitic slogan. A court sentenced the assailant to two years in prison and a fine of $1,300 (4,000 zloty). However, the court suspended the sentence. \n \n On March 27, commentator Stanislaw Michalkiewicz, speaking on Catholic Radio Maryja, made anti-Semitic remarks when he claimed \"Jews are trying to force a ransom from our government which they covertly call restitution\". Michalkiewicz also said the country was being \"humiliated\" by Jews \"at the site of the former death camp Auschwitz\". He was charged with insulting the Jewish community and for denying Nazi war crimes. On August 28, however, prosecutors dropped the charges. Michalkiewicz left Radio Maryja, which has a history of broadcasting anti-Semitic statements, to work for a public radio network, Polskie Radio. \n \n On December 7, a court in Bialystok ordered Leszek Bubel, a self-proclaimed anti-Semite and leader of the Polish National Party, to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. The case stemmed from charges brought by the local prosecutor in August 2005 for an article Bubel published, \"The Polish-Jewish War Over Crosses,\" for which the court sentenced Bubel to six months in prison and a fine of $825 (2,500 zloty) for inciting hostility and slandering Jews. \n \n On November 30, Maciej Giertych, who represents the extreme-right League of Polish Families in the European parliament, dismissed his assistant Leokadia Wiacek after a newspaper revealed a video in which the assistant participated in a 2004 neo-Nazi event, burned a swastika, chanted \"Sieg Heil,\" and gave the Nazi salute. \n \n During the year the government provided grants to a number of organizations involved in tolerance education, including ZIH, which maintained an archive of Jewish-related documents, books, journals, and artifacts. The government also provided grants to ZIH to produce educational materials on Jewish culture, the Holocaust, and religious tolerance. One NGO involved in Holocaust education claimed that their funding through the Ministry of Education was cut abruptly because it was no longer deemed a priority. Government officials denied any connection and claimed that there was no effort to restrict Holocaust education funding. \n \n National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities \n \n There were reports of increasing intolerance that often erupted into violence against racial and ethnic minorities. National and local officials and law enforcement agencies discouraged intolerance and discrimination; however, some minority groups and NGOs noted that the judiciary was lenient in sentencing perpetrators, which contributed to an atmosphere that accepted intolerance. \n \n There were incidents of racially motivated violence and verbal and physical abuse directed at Roma and persons of African, Asian, or Arab descent, as well as Moslems. The small Ukrainian and Belarusian minorities also continued to experience petty harassment and discrimination. \n \n During the year soccer stadiums were scenes of fascist, anti-Semitic, and xenophobic demonstrations and actions by groups such as Blood and Honor, the National Rebirth of Poland, and the All Poland Youth, which is affiliated with a major Catholic political party. For example, in March managers of the Ruch Chorzow team decided not to employ a dark-skinned player from Morocco after receiving several anonymous threats. However, Stal Mielec managers refused to drop two Cameroonians from the team's roster despite receiving complaints from the Association for Polish Football, a football fan club. In the eastern city of Bialystok, fans threw bananas at a dark-skinned player and later beat him up after the match. Additionally, during the March derby in Krakow, fans of the Cracovia Krakow team yelled \"monkey\" at Wisla Krakow player Jean Paulista, a dark-skinned Brazilian. \n \n On May 16, skinheads attacked a journalist in Warsaw with knives after he was identified \"as an enemy of white people\" on a Web site maintained by the Polish Blood and Honor group. On July 5, authorities arrested the Web site's administrator, Bartosz Barcicki, and charged him with disseminating Nazi ideas, xenophobia, and participating in an illegal group. The Web site was shut down but later reestablished. \n \n On November 20, prosecutors in Olsztyn indicted two men charged with assaulting Moroccan long-time resident Abdel Mandili with a dangerous weapon. The men faced up to eight years' imprisonment for their July 23 attack on Mandili. The alleged attackers beat Mandili unconscious at a theater festival in Olsztyn after his group performed a play about the difficulties of immigrants. Eleven other suspects were arrested in connection with the attack but only two have been indicted. \n \n Societal discrimination against Roma continued. In some cases local officials discriminated against Roma by not providing adequate social services. Romani leaders complained of widespread discrimination in employment, housing, banking, the justice system, the media, and education. During the year the IOM began a project as part of an EU-wide undertaking called EQUAL to combat unemployment and improve the situation of \"disfavored\" groups on the labor market. Under the program the IOM established four small Roma-run enterprises which have special legal status and tax privileges. \n \n The Roma Association claimed that more than 50 percent of Romani children did not attend public school out of fear that teachers would try to assimilate them and uproot them from their Roma traditions. The association also noted that the gaps in education made it impossible for Roma to end their poverty; approximately 90 percent of Roma were unemployed. \n \n On October 20, the Silesian community filed an appeal to the Supreme Court to annul the entire judicial process of their application for official minority status, thus ending the matter.\n \n Other Societal Abuses and Discrimination \n \n International NGOs, including Human Rights Watch (HRW) and Amnesty International (AI), and the European Parliament urged the government to end homophobia and to halt attacks on gays and lesbians. In June, HRW and AI separately issued statements expressing concern about possible violence in connection with an \"equality parade\" organized by a consortium of gay rights advocates; the parade was held June 10 without major incidents. \n \n Prior to the equality parade, a Sejm member and prominent member of the Catholic League of Polish Families, Wojciech Wierzejski, criticized the event in remarks before the Sejm, describing gays as \"deviants\" and stating that, when the parade begins, marchers \"should be beaten with batons.\" \n \n On June 15, the European Parliament voted to condemn the rising environment of intolerance and homophobia in the country, with some parliamentarians singling out Wierzejski for inciting violence against gays and lesbians. \n \n There was discrimination against HIV-positive persons. The national AIDS center reported no cases of discrimination against HIV-positive persons in the units supervised and funded by the center. \n",

   "Frankly I don't like they way Poles are doing politics and economics inside EU. \"Cheating\" is actually the word here. \n Take that \"bad Polish meat\" story. Unfortunately it is not just a Russian invention I guess. The other day 123 Polish citizens or so had food poisoning due to the sausages made of the meat infected with trichina worms! The sausages were produced at the Polish \"Rol-Banc\" plant (Be aware!). But I read in the net that Polish food industry is in the habit of buying meat from some other countries, Brasilia and Georgia and other. Frankly it was a revelation for me. Can Polish food stuff be of any good quality when the meat originates with such distant countries? They are not following all the EU standards maybe. Say in Georgia there has been huge raw recently relating hog cholera. Georgia and Poles are close allies. What if that contaminated Georgian pork was delivered to Poland? \n Luckily Merkel refused \"Polish\" meat and we don't face the risk of coming to hospital like they did in Poland herself. I bet you vindictive Poles could well poison us. They still view modern Germans as the followers of the Nazi who killed people in Poland in the last world war.... \n Anyway I think such ways of Poland must be strongly criticized by EU leadership. Cheating isn't the style on civilized European markets. And we must teach Poland manners if we want her as part of EU.",

   "Estonia is facing a disaster able to affect terrifically its livestock industry that is mainly oriented for the EU market. An outbreak of Newcastle disease at a poultry farm in Abja village in Viljani country, Estonia, is now widely believed by Estonian security services to be a diversion by Poland that might be aiming to kick out its competitors. It has already been verified that the Newcastle disease agent was transmitted to Estonian poultry farm by specially trained pigeons through their droppings. \n \n By the way, it is known that Pentagon has been working on using animals for diversionist operations. Perhaps, it is them how shared this know-how with their European protege Poland. As for Poles, they must have used this technology behind the back of their American patrons in order to put competitors out of the way. It may also be that the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Great Britain is a result of unethical competition.",

   "Poland claims leadership in Eastern Europe but in reality she has been huge hurdle in the regional development so far. \n It's not only my vision. It's life. Well, see how it's going on in Ignalina project. Actually it suffered a setback recently when Poland demanded a 1/3 (!) share in of the generated electricity from the new Ignalina nuclear reactor. If refused she threatened to keep Lithuania non-connected to European energy supplying systems. Surely, it was an open energy blackmailing... and ...well....evident challenge to all Europe! I gather it was actually eye opening revelation for many countries. It seems Moldova was among them. The country is set to drop her membership in GUAM organization where Poland is going to play the queen-bee role.\n Don't you think Old Europe should coach excessively ambiguous Poles more intensely in manners and other things so that to escape any Poland's problem in the days to come? What's your vision of the Poland's future perspective in Eastern Europe and EU as a whole? Would be interesting to know.",

   "All Polish people, especially Polish Jews, remember very well how much grief was caused to them by Ukrainian nationalist forces at the time of World War II. Between 1942 and 1944, there were many massacres of Polish Jews, committed by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) that was a branch of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN). Some estimates have put the Polish death toll between 80,000 and 100,000 and many historians, particularly in Poland, use the term genocide or ethnic cleansing to denote the events. \n We hoped that these times have past irrevocably but we were wrong. Though there are no more massacres of Polish Jews, tombs of the victims get desecrated time and again by members of OUN-UPA. This organization still exists in Ukraine and is even actively participating in political life of that country. OUN-UPA and another nationalist movement named PORA were assisting so-called \"orange\" politicians (Yushchenko and Timoshenko in the first hand) in their struggle for power, who, in return, did their best to heroize nationalistic forces. They called them heroes and erected monuments in their honor, despite the fact that they are right-down butchers! \n I think that I will give voice to the general opinion when I say that we need to change that. Nationalism has flooded Ukraine, which is a bad sign. Polish politicians must give a clear notion that Poland DOES NOT support neo-fascists of Ukraine. We want less nationalistic parties come to power so that Poland and Ukraine could build up sound relations.",

   "Hello! As I read czechdaily.wordpress.com/2008/02/05/us-no-visa-as-of-january-2009 , The U.S. administration MIGHT cancel the visa regime for Czechs during the Bush administration, by January 2009 at the latest! The list of the countries who might see the end of the regime include Greece, Cyprus, Malta, Estonia, Hungary and the Czech Republic!! Damn, what about Poland?? Why isn't there Poland in this ####ing list? Did not Warsaw agree to deploy that ####ing missile defense system against the will of the Polish nation and to the risk of the whole country? And waht did we get in return for that? Nothing! Even that trifle of visa-free travel for Poles to the US! What is most annoying me, Czechs are in that stupid list and we are not! It looks like that Washington is not likely to make up for all that risk-taking by Poland coming from deployment of the damned missile defense system! By the way, there is not only the risk of an eventual terrorist attack by Islamites but also an inevitable deterioration of relations with an important trade partner like Russia. You know, at this rate, I believe that Poland might come after Georgia in becoming a huge military base for Yankees while staying beggar. As you may know, the needy Georgia has to do with rare charities from hands of haughty Americans and keeps begging for monetary aid from such marginal EU members like Estonia or Hungary (and they are in the list!). Honestly, recalling the great past time of the Polish empire, I don't think we deserve such future like Georgia!",

   "Another opinion", 
   "As an American of Polish immigrant parents, I have some general familiarity with Polish history. Judging from Polands assumptions and its treatment both by the allies during World War II and now during the Iraq War, Poles often have too naive an approach towards the west in assuming that, if they voluntarily help the West, the West will help them. With the Bush administration, I suspect that there were no pre-arranged agreements of US political or economic aid to Poland - the Poles just assumed that aiding the US in its efforts in Iraq would bring it sound benefits. It is unfortunate that one cannot assume such honorable treatment, but that is reality and one has to understand it and deal accordingly. If I were the Polish government, I would make very sure that any cooperation and benefit it gave to the US would get some level of recompense.\n \n As for the US continuing to restrict Polish visas, my best guess would be that they fear an influx of illegal Polish immigrants - where many Poles do work abroad illegally. I cannot comment on Greece, Cyprus, Malta, Estonia, Hungary and the Czech Republic, but my guess would be that the amount of illegal immigrants to wealthier Western nations from those countries are not as large. If, indeed, the illegal immigrant issue from those countries is equally large, then I would agree that Poland is being treated unfairly in this one point.",

Which means a Brit, German, French visiting each other's countries do not need passports and can live and work freely there.\n \n So, tell me how many countries in the EU have allowed Poles the same privileges ?\n \n Your own European neighbors such as France and Germany have shut the door on your face....and you are whining about America?",

   "Not long ago Jack Chirac had announced about 'menace of new European split' because of Antiballistic missile system problem. All European countries but Poland agreed with it.\n Of course Poles are most special nation. They have their own opinion for every political problem and no EU can lay down the law for him. Polish deputy Defence minister Waszczykowski gladly offered to sign allied agreement with USA, which would guarantee Polish safety.\n In fact Poland announced openly that it is ready to become US base in Europe. Proud Poles practically refused from taking part in building of European collective defence system.\n So it turns out that there would be a bit of America in Europe. I doubt that they'll ask our opinion while placing US ABM system on their territory or God knows what else. If so, what European collective defence are you talking about?\n\n \n \n The fact that Poland choses to rely on the US is no surprise considering its history. Being sandwiched between Russia and Germany is enough to give anybody a nervous breakdown.",
