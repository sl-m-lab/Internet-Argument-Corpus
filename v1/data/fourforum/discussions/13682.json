   "\"Drugmakers' support for health overhaul tested\n \n WASHINGTON - The pharmaceutical industry may have to cough up more than the $80 billion it agreed to contribute to President Barack Obama's health overhaul effort, reflecting pressure from Democrats and their supporters for more money to cover older and low-income people.\n \n Obama and congressional Democrats want the drug industry to remain a crucial ally in the health care fight because of its deep pockets and influence in states where it is a large employer, including New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Indiana. So far, it remains an active backer of the Democrats' efforts to expand a supportive TV ad campaign on which it has already spent tens of millions of dollars.\n \n By many accounts, the health package the House approved last month would count on getting about $140 billion from drug companies to defray additional health care costs over the next decade. Industry officials say the version the Senate is debating may already pluck close to $100 billion from drugmakers - and an expected parade of amendments could boost that by billions more.\"\n \n Full story ...Drugmakers' support for health overhaul tested\n \n Drug companies could do a LOT with $80 billion dollars to help the poor with their meds. But no, they would rather sleep with the socialists. \n \n Nevermind the fact, many drug companies have received billions in grants over the years for research. Grant money from OUR tax dollars.",
