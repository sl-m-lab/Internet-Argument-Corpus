   "According to the article he supports the Jewish settlement in the Holy Land. \n \n \"Only once in human history did God take a country as an inheritance and give it to His chosen people,\" Schoenborn said, adding that Pope John Paul II had himself declared the biblical commandment for Jews to live in Israel an everlasting covenant that remained valid today.\"\n \n He was even challenged on that point by a A Palestinian priest.\n \n This \"born again\" Christian feels Israel is the land God gave the Jews.\n \n As far as \"neocon\" - Neoconservatism refers to the political goals and ideology of the \"new conservatives\" in the United States, characterized by hawkish or jingoist views on foreign policy and a lesser emphasis on social issues and minimal government than other strains of American conservatism. The \"newness\" refers either to being new to American conservatism (often coming from liberal or socialist backgrounds)\n \n I don't have a liberal background. I'm a hawk on foreign policy but also have a big emphasis on social issues. So technically \"neocon\" does not apply.",
