   "Nice try. \n \n http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/wackoattacko/\n \n \nI can guarantee to you, without equivocation, that every fact in my movie is true. Three teams of fact-checkers and two groups of lawyers went through it with a fine tooth comb to make sure that every statement of fact is indeed an indisputable fact. Trust me, no film company would ever release a film like this without putting it through the most vigorous vetting process possible. (...)\n \n Well, guess what. Total number of lawsuits to date against me or my film by the NRA? NONE. That's right, zero. And don't forget for a second that if they could have shut this film down on a technicality they would have. But they didn't and they can't - because the film is factually solid and above reproach. In fact, we have not been sued by any individual or group over the statements made in \"Bowling for Columbine?\" Why is that? Because everything we say is true - and the things that are our opinion, we say so and leave it up to the viewer to decide if our point of view is correct or not for each of them. \n \n So, faced with a thoroughly truthful and honest film, those who object to the film's political points are left with the choice of debating us on the issues in the film - or resorting to character assassination. They have chosen the latter. What a sad place to be. \n",

Documentries have a higher level of honesty and unmaniplulated foothage.\n\n Show me a documentary film that doesn't edit for clarity or to make a point. That is the purpose of documentary film. If you have been watching documentaries your whole life thinking you weren't being \"manipulated\", wake up. Film is manipulative, books are manipulative, people are manipulative. There is not such thing as objectivity. The question is: whose point of view do you want to believe?\n \n That isn't the same thing as outright fabrication. But Moore didn't photoshop Heston's face onto someone else's body, he didn't change Heston's words. Heston dug himself into his own hole.\n \n2) Lockheed Martin builds optical spy and commerical satellites. Why the nukes, bombs, and missiles in the movie?\n\n They were rockets. Rockets that carry.... satellites. Don't you feel silly? \n \n From the same website I linked to above, because some people refuse to go read things themselves-\n \n The Truth: Lockheed Martin is the largest weapons-maker in the world <suntimes_20030617.php<. The Littleton facility has been manufacturing missiles, missile components, and other weapons systems for almost half a century. In the 50s, workers at the Littleton facility constructed the first Titan intercontinental ballistic missile, designed to unleash a nuclear warhead on the Soviet Union; in the mid-80s, they were partially assembling MX missiles, instruments for the minuteman ICBM, a space laser weapon called Zenith Star, and a Star Wars program known as Brilliant Pebbles <lockheed.php<. \n \n In the full, unedited interview I did with the Lockheed spokesman, he told me that Lockheed started building nuclear missiles in Littleton and \"played a role in the development of Peacekeeper MX Missiles.\" <movie.php?mov=lockheed-03< \n As for what's currently manufactured in Littleton, McCollum told me, \"They (the rockets sitting behind him) carry mainly very large national security satellites, some we can't talk about.\" (see him say it here <movie.php?mov=lockheed-01<) \n \n Since that interview, the Titan IV rockets manufactured in Littleton have been critical to the war effort in both Afghanistan and Iraq. These rockets launched advanced satellites that were \"instrumental in providing command-and-control operations over Iraq...for the rapid targeting of Navy Tomahawk cruise missiles involved in Iraqi strikes and clandestine communications with Special Operations Forces.\" (view source here <aviationweek.php<). \n \n That Lockheed lets the occasional weather or TV satellite hitch a ride on one of its rockets should not distract anyone from Lockheed's main mission and moneymaker in Littleton: to make instruments that help kill people. That two of Littleton's children decided to engineer their own mass killing is what these guys and the Internet crazies don't want to discuss. \n \n1) That is a cartoon? Do you believe in cartoons? My nephew believes that things he sees in Bugs Bunny is real.\n\n Well then Moore should have considered your nephew before making this movie! emoticon_rolleyes And you shouldn't let him watch Bugs Bunny, either, until he understands that cartoons aren't real- Bugs Bunny cartoons are awfully violent. \n \n Do you believe everything you see in cartoons are real? Do you believe that the intended audience for this film was little kids? If so, better take a reality check...\n \n \n3) Chuck Heston never said, \"From my cold dead hands in Denver\". (sic)\n \n \n The Truth: Heston took his NRA show to Denver and did and said exactly what we recounted <movie.php?mov=heston<. From the end of my narration setting up Heston's speech in Denver, with my words, \"a big pro-gun rally,\" every word out of Charlton Heston's mouth was uttered right there in Denver, just 10 days after the Columbine tragedy. But don't take my word - read the transcript of his whole speech <heston.php<. Heston devotes the entire speech to challenging the Denver mayor and mocking the mayor's pleas that the NRA \"don't come here.\" Far from deliberately editing the film to make Heston look worse, I chose to leave most of this out and not make Heston look as evil as he actually was. \n \n Why are these gun nuts upset that their brave NRA leader's words are in my film? You'd think they would be proud of the things he said. Except, when intercut with the words of a grieving father (whose son died at Columbine and happened to be speaking in a protest that same weekend Heston was at the convention center), suddenly Charlton Heston doesn't look so good does he? Especially to the people of Denver (and, the following year, to the people of Flint) who were still in shock over the tragedies when Heston showed up. \n \n As for the clip preceding the Denver speech, when Heston proclaims \"from my cold dead hands,\" this appears as Heston is being introduced in narration.  It is Heston's most well-recognized NRA image - hoisting the rifle overhead as he makes his proclamation, as he has done at virtually every political appearance on behalf of the NRA (before and since Columbine). I have merely re-broadcast an image supplied to us by a Denver TV station, an image which the NRA has itself crafted for the media, or, as one article put it, \"the mantra of dedicated gun owners\" which they \"wear on T-shirts, stamp it on the outside of envelopes, e-mail it on the Internet and sometimes shout it over the phone.\" <latimes.php<. Are they now embarrassed by this sick, repulsive image and the words that accompany it? \n \n \n about documentaries- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary\n \n some definitions of \"documentary\" from a filmmaker's perspective- from http://www.realityfilm.com/study/definitions.html\n \n Documentary Definitions \n \n The word \"documentary\" poses many challenges in providing an quick definition. Here are some definitions from various reference guides and textbooks: \n \n \"Documentary is the creative treatment of actuality.\"\n -- John Grierson, Cinema Quarterly 2.1, 8. \n \n \"Documentary defines not subject or style, but approach. ... Documentary approach to cinema differs from that of story-film not in its disregard for craftsmanship, but in the purpose to which that craftsmanship is put.\"\n --Paul Rotha, Cinema Quarterly, 2.2, 78. \n \n \"A non-fiction text using 'actuality' footage, which may include the live recording of events and relevant research materials (i.e. interviews, statistics, etc.). This kind of text is uually informed by a particular point of view, and seeks to address a particular social issue which is related to and potentially affects the audience.\"\n --Paul Wells, \"The Documentary Form: Personal and Social 'Realities,'\" An Introduction to Film Studies, 2nd ed., ed. Jill Nelmes, 212. \n \n \"[A]ny film practice that has as its subject persons, events, or situations that exist outside the film in the real world.\"\n --Steve Blandford, Barry Keith Grant, and Jim Hillier, The Film Studies Dictionary, 73. \n \n \"A nonfiction film. Documentaries are usually shot on location, use actual persons rather than actors, and focus thematically on historical, scientific, social, or environmental subjects. Their principle purpose is to enlighten, inform, educate, persuade, and provide insight into the world in which we live.\"\n --Frank Beaver, Dictionary of Film Terms, 119. \n \n \"A nonfiction film about real events and people, often avoiding traditional narrative structures.\"\n --Timothy Corrigan, A Short Guide to Writing About Film, 4th ed., 206. \n \n \"Film of actual events; the events are documented with the real people involved, not with actors.\"\n --Ralph S. Singleton and James A. Conrad, Filmmaker's Dictionary, 2nd ed., 94. \n \n \"A documentary film purports to present factual information about the world outside the film.\"\n --David Bordwell and Kristin Thompson, Film Art: An Introduction, 5th ed., 42. \n \n \"A film or video presentation of actual events using the real people involved and not actors.\"\n --John W. Cones, Film Finance and Distribution, 154. \n \n \"A film that deals directly with fact and not fiction, that tries to convey reality as it is instead of some fictional version of reality. These films are concerned with actual people, places, events, or activities.\"\n \"A type of film marked by its interpretative handling of realistic subjects and backgrounds. Sometimes the term is applied widely to include films that appear more realistic than conventional commercial pictures; at other times, so narrowly that only films with a narration track and a background of real life are so categorized.\"\n --Edmund F. Penney, Facts on File Film and Broadcast Terms, 73. \n \n \"A term with a wide latitude of meaning, basically used to refer to any film or program not wholly fictional in nature.\"\n --James Monaco, The Dictionary of New Media, 94. \n \n Note that none of these definitions say \"unedited\". That is because at least half of documentary film-making is the editing process.",

   "\n \n \n The Truth: Heston took his NRA show to Denver and did and said exactly what we recounted <movie.php?mov=heston<. From the end of my narration setting up Heston's speech in Denver, with my words, \"a big pro-gun rally,\" every word out of Charlton Heston's mouth was uttered right there in Denver, just 10 days after the Columbine tragedy. But don't take my word - read the transcript of his whole speech <heston.php<. Heston devotes the entire speech to challenging the Denver mayor and mocking the mayor's pleas that the NRA \"don't come here.\" Far from deliberately editing the film to make Heston look worse, I chose to leave most of this out and not make Heston look as evil as he actually was. .\n\n \n YOU LIAR.\n \n You are distorting the truth the same way Moore did. The truth is the NRA event was planned 1 year before the killings in Littleton. The truth is the NRA rally was canceled excpet for the officers meetings which is required by LAW to NOT BE CANCELED. HESTON said \"FROM MY COLD DEAD HANDS\" in North Carolina 1 year later.\n \n \n And what transcript are you talking about? The transcript is posted above. What big pro-gun rally are you talking about in Denver. Do you mean the one that NEVER happened?",

Just in case.\n \n The fear you talk about is a problem with society and should not be solved as a government program or law. You can not legislate good citizenship. At least I can not think of a good citzen anti-gun law that does not violate civil rights. The purpose of law and justice system is to punish and try to fix damages only AFTER a crime. The purpose of government is to not stand in the way of people trying to get by with life, not help or hurt people who are doing just fine. The newest crop of anti-gun good society laws simply do not work(Brady). If the violence is society is not fixed first, such a law will be going against human tide of behavior. If the law in not in the hearts of society and people, then the law is useless. Violence is a behavior problem, not a gun problem. I'll have to give credit where it is due, Brady works in well with the instant background check, but with nothing else.",
