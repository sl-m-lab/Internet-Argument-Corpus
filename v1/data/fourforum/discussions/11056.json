The Conservatives are currently facing a schism with the possibility of a combined reformist-conservative front against the current administration. The populace is generally sick and tired of the current administration's various failures. Bombing Iran would instantly unite these factions which may be the start of the collapse of the political regime and the birth of a new Iran. You people haven't learned anything from Vietnam or the Malaya Emergency. Another huge reasons not to attack Iran is that it proves that the only thing the US fears is a nuclear weapon. Every nation on our hit list will then start building weapons. Third, we can't afford it. Not in troops or money. Invading Iran will put the US into bankruptcy.",

   "@OC\n I think that you are right in saying that the Regime in Iran is not enjoying the support of the entire populous, mostly younger generations, esp. women and college kids as well as some of the better educated 'middle class' that's tired of the govt. spending a bunch of money on things that don't make the people better off. However, I don't really think they will be in any position to do anything about the men that run the country. Even if the sanctions make the situation worse, I don't think you'll ever see a popular uprising (at least not one with any chance of success). Also, there's a good chance that the sanctions could have a similar effect of bringing the country together. It just depends who wins the propaganda war between the govt. and reformers.\n \n But, at all costs we must not let them obtain a Nuc. I think that Israel would take it out anyway, but if not, we'd have to. OC I don't think we should kid ourselves that ALL of our enemies KNOW that we most fear a nuclear weapon and everyone of them would start a program if they could afford it or get away with it. To say that it's some secrete that we're scared of 'weapons of mass destruction' is untenable. \n \n There's no doubt that Iran is a trouble maker. Without Nucs though, their body count will be limited. But with WMDs they'd be a real threat that would have to be addressed militarily.",

And we will pursue nations that provide aid or safe haven to terrorism. Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make. Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists. (Applause.)

Indeed they are indirectly funding Al Qaeda at this very moment by funding radical Sunni groups in Iran.\n \n Then we can take a look at Bush's statement shortly after the Sept 11 attack. He said, \"We will starve terrorists of funding, turn them one against another, drive them from place to place, until there is no refuge or no rest. And we will pursue nations that provide aid or safe haven to terrorism. Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make. Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists. (Applause.) From this day forward, any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime.\"\n \n Yet the nation that was most visibly the supporter of the Sept 11 attack, and is also very visibly the supporter of many terrorist organisations, Saudi Arabia, is still all chummy with the US because the Saudi royals are close friends of the Bush family.\n \n So don't go saying that the US has just propped up a few despots because it was convevient at the time. They have been, and still are funding, supplying and even training terrorists for decades. I realise that this is not easy for you to hear, but it doesn't take a lot of research to find out when and where this support has been forthcoming. Then you will realise why the rest of the world doesn't trust the US.\n \n Smiley\n \n PS don't bother with the \"You would all be speaking German/Russian if it weren't for us good guys\" rubbish anymore. It doesn't work.\n\n \n\n \n As I said, the US has been the 1# protector of the World for a very long time now. Sometimes you've got to pick the 'lesser of evils.' Like where you refer to our support of the freedom fighters in Afgan. Yes, we supported them in their fight against the USSR. Just as now we support them in their fight against the Taliban et. al. It was the right thing to do to support them then and now. We needed Saddam to win (or at least hold off) Iran back in the 80's. All first and second tier countries sometimes have to make decisions like that. The EU countries have done so as well. It's unfortunate that it sometimes has to be done but it does. I shudder to think what the world would be like if the US wasn't doing what it does. Do things sometimes go wrong? Yes. But we are doing our best. And the German/Russian argument DOES hold up--because it is true.",

Those who live by the funding of terrorism, die by the funding of terrorism. You have no cause for complaint.\n \n Smiley",

   "Of course he is not insulting anyone of those nations you mention. He is just saying that they (and their sacrifice) are insignificant in comparison to the US.\n \n Need I say more?\n \n Smiley\n\n \n \n That is a complete misrepresentation of my beliefs. I know that MANY people of both sides (there were innocent Germans etc. that hated what their country had become) died, many in horrible torturous ways. But this argument between me and smiley goes back several threads to Smiley's constant dismissal of the US being responsible for ANYTHING on this planet besides misery, suffering, torture, death, and lies. Smiley thinks (and constantly asserts) that the US isn't a force for good on this planet. He holds the contradictory views that the US has been powerless to affect good changes in the world (we're just a bit player in the 2 world wars, not that much Tsunami relief, etc...) but somehow we have an extraordinary power for evil (he probably thinks we had something to do with 9/11 and that abu-ghraib was White House policy).\n \n Smiley's claimed again and again that the US has had little to do with the victories in WWI and WWII. That our sacrifice was minimal compared to other countries (which is true in body count, but again I contend that these wars were fought because of the 'Old Powers' and their royal intermarriages and secrete and convoluted alliances) and that we didn't even have to fight on our own territories (again because we really didn't have much to do with starting the wars). We went to war and died for the GOOD Ideals we as a country hold dear. It was not like it was some big land grab for the US. We have a philosophy that people should control their own govt. and we're not in the business of taking over other countries (read; colonial powers), we are not the dark seedy shadow creeping over the helpless countryside ready to swallow the world hole. Smiley says that people don't trust the USA because we are a nuc. power and a sponsor of terrorism. This is a ludicrous statement. No one in their right mind thinks that the US is going to give ANYONE (such as a Hamaas type group) a nuc. to carry out our foreign policy.\n \n I and the rest of the country know that there have been many, many others like us fighting for freedom and democracy for a long time (and still today) and I assure you I didn't ever want to diminish their sacrifices and I know I shouldn't let Smiley get under my skin like that. I apologize if I offended anyone in the same way that he offended me (this entire 'thing' is really just a continuation of stuff from a couple of other threads, which many of you on this thread may not have known). That's wasn't my intention, I just was trying to show that the US IS NOW and HAS been a force for good in the world. Danke!",

It can be argued rather convincingly after looking at German casualties per front, the general failure of air bombing, and other evidence that based purely on fighting, the CCCP won the war rather then the United Kingdom, Free French and the United States. But an argument revolving around the issue of funding would suggest that without the United States, the Axis Powers would have eventually been victorious.",

   "From newsmax...\n \n \n \n \n www.newsmax.com \n Headline Story RSS ARCHIVE \n \n Print Page | Forward Page | E-mail Us \n \n \n \n Source: U.S. Strike on Iran Nearing \n \n Monday, April 14, 2008 9:37 PM\n \n By: Jim Meyers Article Font Size \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Contrary to some claims that the Bush administration will allow diplomacy to handle Iran's nuclear weapons program, a leading member of America's Jewish community tells Newsmax that a military strike is not only on the table - but likely. \n \n \n \"Israel is preparing for heavy casualties,\" the source said, suggesting that although Israel will not take part in the strike, it is expecting to be the target of Iranian retribution. \n \n \n \"Look at Dick Cheney's recent trip through the Middle East as preparation for the U.S. attack,\" the source said. \n \n \n Cheney's hastily arranged 9-day visit to the region, which began on March 16, included stops in Israel, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Oman, Turkey, and the Palestinian territories. \n \n \n Tensions in the region have been rising. \n \n \n While Israel was conducting the largest homefront military exercises in its history last week, Israel's National Infrastructure Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer warned Tehran about expected attacks on the Jewish state. \n \n \n \"An Iranian attack will prompt a severe reaction from Israel, which will destroy the Iranian nation,\" he said. \n \n \n He predicted that in a future war, \"hundreds of missiles will rain on Israel,\" but added that Iran \"is definitely aware of our strength.\" \n \n \n In addition to long-range missiles Iran has been developing to strike Israel, Israel's military strategists see the Iranians using terror groups they back like Hamas operating from Palestine and Hezbollah from Lebanon to launch attacks. \n \n \n Iran has supplied Hezbollah with an arsenal that now contains \"tens of thousands of missiles,\" according to the Washington Post. \n \n \n IIsrael's recent war exercises, including preparations for chemical and biological weapons attacks, drew a sharp response from Syria which held its own military drills. The Syrian government accused Israel of preparing for a war which Damascus predicted would be begin anytime between May 1 and the end of June. \n \n \n Former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently told foreign journalists that Israel needs to confront the threat posed by Iran. Privately he has been telling associates his number one priority is have the Israeli military strike Iran if the U.S. is unwilling. \n \n \n The Israeli newspaper Haaretz disclosed that Israel is concerned that North Korea has transferred technology and nuclear materials to Iran to aid Tehran's secret nuclear weapons program. \n \n \n Iran remains intransigent to international pressure that it offer full transparency relating to its nuclear program. On Sunday the head of Iran's nuclear program \"abruptly canceled a meeting with the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, dealing a blow to the U.N. monitor's efforts to investigate allegations that Iran tried to make nuclear arms, an agency official said,\" according to an AP report. \n \n \n \"But a senior diplomat had told the AP that IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] head Mohamed ElBaradei likely planned to use the meeting with Gholam Reza Aghazadeh, the head of Iran's nuclear program, to renew a request for more information on allegations Tehran had tried to make atomic arms.\" \n \n \n A number of signs indicate that, contrary to the belief President Bush is a lame duck who will not act before he leaves office, the U.S. is poised to strike before Iran can acquire nuclear weapons and carry out the threat of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to \"wipe Israel off the map\": \n \n \n \n According to intelligence sources, the administration now rejects the National Intelligence Estimate report issued in December that asserted Iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in late 2003. \n \n \n The French daily Le Monde reported in March that newly surfaced documents show that Iran has continued developing nuclear weapons. In late 2006, U.S. intelligence reportedly intercepted a phone conversation in Iran's Defense Ministry in which the nuclear weapons program was discussed. \n \n \n \n The commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East, Admiral William Fallon, resigned in March amid media reports that he broke with President Bush's strategy on Iran and did not want to be in the chain of command when the order comes down from the President to launch a strike on the Islamic Republic. \n \n \n Democrats suggested he had been forced out because of his candor in opposing Bush's Iran plans, and Esquire magazine contended that Fallon's departure signaled that the U.S. is preparing to attack Iran. \n \n \n \n According to a Tehran-based Iranian news network, Press TV, Saudi Arabia is taking emergency steps in preparing to counter any \"radioactive hazards\" that may result from an American attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. \n \n \n The Saudi newspaper Okaz disclosed that the Saudi government has approved nuclear fallout preparations, and the Iranian network reported that the approval came a day after Cheney met with the kingdom's high-ranking officials, further stating that the U.S. \"is now informing its Arab allies of a potential war.\" \n \n \n \n The American commander in Iraq, Gen. David Petraeus, has stepped up criticism of Iran, telling Congress last week that Iranian support for Shiite militias posed the most serious threat to Iraq's stability. He told senators : \"Iran has fueled the violence in a particularly damaging way.\" Last week, the U.S. said Iran was providing insurgents with missiles that were killing Americans and hitting targets within the U.S. occupied Green Zone in Baghdad. \n \n \n MSNBC Commentator Pat Buchanan said Petraeus' remarks to Congress lay the groundwork for a U.S. attack on Iran. \n \n \n \n President Bush said in a speech at the White House on April 10 that Iran, along with al-Qaida, are \"two of the greatest threats to America.\" \n \n \n He said Iran \"can live in peace with its neighbors,\" or \"continue to arm and train and fund illegal militant groups which are terrorizing the Iraqi people ... If Iran makes the wrong choice, America will act to protect our interests and our troops and our Iraqi partners.\" \n \n \n He later told ABC News that if Iran continues to help militants in Iraq, \"then we'll deal with them.\" \n \n \n Members of Congress are said to have been briefed by the administration about the rising Iran threat. \n \n \n Iran did little to cool tensions when it announced that it had begun installing 6,000 new centrifuges at its uranium enrichment plant in Natanz. \n \n \n Centrifuges can enrich uranium to a low level to produce nuclear fuel or a high level for use in weapons. \n \n \n The announcement of the new centrifuges by President Ahmadinejad came on April 8, Iran's National Day of Nuclear Technology, which marked the second anniversary of Iran's first enrichment of uranium. \n \n \n Iran already has about 3,000 centrifuges operating in Natanz, and the new announcement was widely seen as a show of defiance to international demands to halt a nuclear program that the U.S. and its allies insist is aimed at building nuclear weapons. \n \n \n \n \n \u00a9 2008 Newsmax.

   "Newsmax is Fox entirely stripped of anything remotely resembling journalism and truth. \n \n That article makes little sense.\n \n First of all, Iran only need about 5 missiles to wipe out Israel. Without Tel Aviv and Haifa there really isn't all that much to Israel. It only takes a small yield weapon to take out those cities. Furthermore, Iran probably won't use a missile. Israel's air defense is impressive and Iran's missile technology is pathetic. They will probably just smuggle a weapon in, similar to how any periphery nation will attack a core nation. You don't use missiles. You use a donkey pulling a cart. Furthermore, the SECOND Iran attacks Israel, Israel will nuke every major city in Iran. Israel possess the capacity to nuke the coast cities within three to five minutes. The choke point is the launch times for the harpoon missiles on their Dolphin subs. Why would Iran sacrifice itself? And what makes you think that Saudi Arabia doesn't already have nuclear shelters? You do realize they probably had them since the cold war?",
