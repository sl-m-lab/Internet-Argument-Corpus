   "I think Sharon allready have played his part in the conflict by polarizing the Palestinian society and drawing out the most extreme elements into the light. While this has been done to a terrible price in the loss of lives on both sides, it has also depleted the ranks of the more extreme forces among the palestinians. While I can`t say for sure it has been positive when all is said and don (both for the price paid in human lives, but also by creating and encouraging extremism among the palestinians) I think Israel and Palestine indeed are in a situation where matters can change dramaticly. The intifada is running out of steam, the Palestinians and the Israelis are battle weary and Hamas have been exposed to the rest of the world. But, I think the ambitions of Sharon and Likkud are in the way of any possible sollution. Sharon is not ready to compromise (just like Arafat) and Likkud draw far too much support from the illegal settlers. I`m not certain it must be the labour party who should lead the Israelis to peace, but I don`t think it can be Sharon and Likkud",

   "Allthough he [Abbas] is also the current Prime Minister after having forced Arafat to clean up the security forces and try to rid them of Hamas supporters and terrorist advocates.\n Surely you jest. Firstly, it's no secret that Arafat successfully blocked every attempt to \"clean up\" the dizzying array of Palestinian security forces. If you still think otherwise, please be specific as to what significant concessions you think Arafat has made.\n \n Secondly, Mahmoud Abbas is not the current prime minister. Indeed, it was more than a year ago that he resigned as PM. Why did he resign? Why of course it was his failure to achieve the very thing that you say he achieved. \n \n In brief, there was a public and contentious power struggle between Abbas and Arafat over control of the Palestinian security services. Arafat won that struggle, refusing to relinquish any control to Abbas, and thereby prompting Abbas to resign last year just months after Arafat had appointed him as the first prime minister of the Palestinian Authority. Arafat subsequently nominated Ahmed Qurei to replace Abbas.\n \n Unsurprisingly, Qurei has likewise disputed with Arafat over control of the security forces. Despite your contrary assertion, the fact remains that apart from some minor concessions, Arafat continued to retain control over the bulk of a dozen security services, much to the dismay of his supporters in the EU.\n \n \n \n \nI fear that Arafat was reduced to merely a symbol after the camp David talks and the following Intifada.\nThere's an obvious incongruity to imagining that Arafat was merely a symbol, but even if it were true, why would you fear it? He proved at Camp David he was utterly incapable of transforming his status from terrorist pioneer to elder statesman. His dictatorial rule and the widespread corruption of his regime was a blatant betrayal of his people. Witness the despair and rampant chaos that rule the Palestinian street today.\n \n \n \n \nBut at least Sharon will be forced to consider the Palestinain Government again.\nArafat's demise, in and of itself, cannot force Sharon (or any other Israeli PM, for that matter) to resume negotiations with a non-existent partner. To even suggest such a thing is to contradict your other opinion that Arafat was 'merely a symbol' rather than the substance of real power in the PA. Make up your mind, since Arafat can't be both a mere symbol and a quintessential power simultaneously.\n \n Who do you imagine can now lead the PA? No one from the PLO's founding generation will have control on the ground, where power will likely accrue to such groups as Hamas or local armed gangs. Who exactly do you think can force Sharon or Israel to deal with them? Unless there arises a Palestinian leadership that is both willing and able to dismantle the terrorist infrastructure, Israel will not be forced to give serious consideration to any new govn't.\n \n If a Palestinian partner for peace assumes governmental power, wielding a strong enough hand to face down Hamas and the other irredentists sworn to Israel's destruction, then the Palestinians can possibly save themselves from further anarchy and deepening despair. Short of that, the Israeli people have shown in the last two election cycles that they are no longer willing to engage a Palestinian leadership that continues to fund or condone terrorism. It doesn't matter whether the Israeli government is Labour or Likud.\n \n \n \n \nI think the ambitions of Sharon and Likkud are in the way of any possible sollution... I`m not certain it must be the labour party who should lead the Israelis to peace, but I don`t think it can be Sharon and Likkud\n \nI think you misread the Israeli electorate. Most everyone opposed to Sharon predicted his political demise from the moment he defeated Barak in 2001. Indeed, there were doubts he could even form a government, but the pundits were proved wrong when he formed a 'national unity' coalition by bringing the Labour Party into the government. When Labour pulled out nearly two years later, thereby collapsing the government and triggering new elections, the Israeli people voted overwhelmingly to return Sharon to power. \n \n In contrast, Labour, led by Amram Mitzna, garnered less than 15% of the vote. It's a good thing you're not certain that Labour must lead the way to peace; else, peace would remain out of reach just as the PM's chair remains out of Labour's reach. It's evident that the left-leaning Labour Party has little or no chance to lead Israelis to peace, since the bold steps required can only be implemented by a leader like Sharon. I think history attests to this view.\n \n It was a right-wing Likud government, led by Menachem Begin, that signed the Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty in 1979 that handed the Sinai peninsula to Egypt. It was a Likud government, led by Yitzhak Shamir, that first engaged the Palestinians in 1991 at the Madrid Peace Conference, which was the catalyst for the Oslo Accords. It was a Likud government, led by Benyamin Netanyahu, that signed the Hebron Accord in 1997 which led to Israeli forces withdrawing from one of Judaism's holiest cities where Abraham is buried and King David had his capital.\n \n Though Sharon, in your view, blocks the way to a solution, recent history suggests that a peaceful solution will come only with someone like Sharon at the helm, assuming the Palestinians can likewise field a peace partner to match.\n \n Meanwhile, Sharon's \"Gaza Withdrawal\" initiative appears so uncharacteristic of what people believed him incapable of doing, that even leftist parties are now supporting him, while his own divided Likud seems destined to self-destruct. It is hard to imagine that there is another politician in Israel with the foresight, courage, and strength to carry out such a move.\n \n Do not lose sight of the fact that though it was Labour that brought us the Oslo Accords, the Labour PM Yitzhak Rabin did not dare to evacuate any settlements, not even a single settlement. It is the Likud that is destined for this historic mission. Even at the price of dismantling his own party, Sharon will not be deterred. He is spearheading a change that no other political leader in Israel could possibly bring about.",
