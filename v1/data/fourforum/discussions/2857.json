   "I forgot about Oral Roberts University's biology department.\n \n http://biology.oru.edu/\n \n \"Biology is the study of life and, as such, relates to all aspects of human life on earth. Our students are stimulated to acquire a working knowledge of biological systems to be able to address biological challenges that affects their daily lives. One aim in our program is to integrate our Biblical faith with our study of the biological sciences. The faculty strongly espouse that their faith in Christ does not impede their scientific endeavors; rather, it encourages them to elucidate the majesty and glory of God as revealed through the workings of His biological Creation. Thus, we consider a vocation in biology as a God-ordained calling into the study of the wonders of His Creation. Another goal is to train students to use scientific and critical thinking skills to accurately discriminate between scientific facts and pseudoscience.\"\n \n Are they sure that they are discriminating properly?\n \n At least they have the balls to list some alumni:\n http://biology.oru.edu/servlet/page?_pageid=1750&_dad=portal30&_schema=PORTAL30&dept=BIO\n \n It's good to see that some are doing quite well, mostly in medical professions.\n \n And wouldn't you know it? One is a high school teacher!",

   "First, for me evolution is an obvious and elegant natural process, a scientific fact. It is not a doctrine and it should not be indoctronated. Rather it should be 'discovered' and recognized by each individual. A thorough understanding of such things as embryology and taxonomy (subjects mentioned) provides a basis for understanding and concluding evolution and should be taught before the subject of evolution is brought up more than casually. However by the time one is in college, evolution should be presented as conclusive.\n \n So in this regard, Liberty University is inadvertently laying the foundation. It is up to the graduate to determine whether he or she will remain in the comfort of literal doctrine or will be open to the true wonders of the natural creation. It is erroneous to think that biology cannot be understood or apprecated without evolution. It can be studied and appreaciated as discreet facts. Evolution explains why and how -in the natural world- and adds to that understanding.",

Evolution explains why and how -in the natural world- and adds to that understanding.\n\n \n What for you, are evolutions flaws - if any?\n \n There are studies that suggest that the genes don't contain all that is necessary to account for biological forms.\n \n This is cut and pasted from another thread on the Evolution debate\n \n The mechanistic process in Darwin's idea is disputed by other theories of evolution. Lawrence Henderson wrote \"Fitness of the Environment\" \n You can see a very large tract on it at http://www.members.iinet.net/~sejones/pe06envr.html . The earth seems so suited for life, it can't have been by chance that life came about by chance. The inference is that there's an intelligence/blueprint behind it. This does not mean that the Christian God is proved by it, or God in any definition. BUT it is a form of evolutionary theory that tackles the problems of the holes in Darwin's mechanistic models.\n Michael Denton agrees with when he states that the gene-centric theory of neo-Darwinism - is insufficient to explain all aspects of biology. He states \"Yet by the late 1980s it was becoming obvious to most genetic researchers, including myself, since my own main research interest in the '80s and '90s was human genetics, that the heroic effort to find the information specifying life's order in the genes had failed. There was no longer the slightest justification for believing that there exists anything in the genome remotely resembling a program capable of specifying in detail all the complex order of the phenotype... From being 'isolated directors' of a one-way game of life, genes are now considered to be interactive players in a dynamic two-way dance of almost unfathomable complexity, as described by Keller in \"The Century of the Gene\"\n Michael John Denton \"An Anti-Darwin Intellectual Journey\", in Dembski, W. A. (ed) \"Uncommon Dissent: Intellectuals who Find Darwinism Unconvincing\", p172.\n He gives examples of the folds in RNA which happen consistently, and independently of genetic coding... but these rules governing the folds... \"These laws of protein form are strictly equivalent to the rules that govern the way atoms are combined into molecules or subatomic particles are combined into atoms to generate the periodic table of elements...\n The folds present stunning evidence, perhaps the first clear evidence discovered in biology, that highly complex organic forms can be generated by natural law. With the folds, the impossible has become possible - the basic building blocks of nature are specified in abstract laws of form and are not simply a mechanical program in the genes. They are lawful, emergent, self-organising forms and not contingent 'cleverly contrived machines'. Here is a set of forms that arise directly out of the basic properties of matter, confirming the inference I had previously drawn from reading Henderson, that life might be encoded in the basic properties of matter.\"\n Ibid, pp173-74",
