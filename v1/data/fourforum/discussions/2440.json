   "I think the world is again facing the mortal threat of nuclear war now. And this threat seems to be even more real than that one that existed dozens of years ago. It's because of those mini-nukes, tactical nuclear weapons. Many countries and terrorist groupings can afford them both technically and financially. I guess Americans paved the way for this trend to become a steady one. The US with their strongest conventional forces in the world still insists on having lots of usable nuclear weapons. If my memory doesn't fail me 6000-7000 warheads as 'a hedge against uncertainty' will suit them well. \n So it's no wonder Israel is on this path too. I got to know from some quite reliable sources that Israel is going to test mini-nukes on the Indian proving grounds. In its turn India gets the support of Israel in case of the open hostilities with Pakistan. It's quite a bargain for both sides involved! And it's all due to America. Firstly, it's her general position on the issue. Secondly, it's American particular position on the Israeli moves relating Palestine. Israel was given a free hand and has developed the taste since. \n Is it the end of nuclear non-proliferation policy? If so, the future holds gloomy perspectives for mankind.",

   "Of course the US has also attacked one axis of evil nation because they were supposidly developing WMDs but didn't attack one that had already developed WMDs. That means if you are Iran or Syria you are looking to get nukes as fast as possible right now. That is not a good thing for anyone.\n \n The odds of us facing a nuclear war soon is probably pretty slim. As far as India and Pakistan go they have been at each others throat for some time now and seem to be backing away a little now that India is having some economic success. But then again India is back in the hands of fascists and communists from what I hear. Who knows where that could lead to.\n \n I doubt Israel will be testing any sort of nuclear weapon anytime soon since they maintain that they have no nuclear weapons and although everyone believes that they do, they would be fools to come out and show that world that their suspicions are correct. The UN would jump on Israel right away for having nuclear weapons and I doubt they would let Israel off the hook so easy just because of their alliance with the US. It would be Israel basically slapping the UN in the face if they tested a standard or mini nuclear weapon.\n \n The size of the US nuclear arsenal is about 7000 and Russia has about 10000 plus the ones that are not full decommissioned yet. Both countries are supposed to limit themselves to 1000 nuclear weapons before they complete their decommissioning. Heh, they have both come a long ways since Russia had about 50000 and the US had about 30000.\n \n Nuclear war is a fear that many of us have and that is why the Cold War never became Nuke War 1. Both sides were terrified of each other and what could happen if things got too out of hand. No government that is currently in power wants to have a nuclear war with any other. It would be the end of both of them therefore making the risks way higher than the rewards. Even North Korea knows this. I just cannot see a true nuclear war happening anytime soon.",

   "there is a low risk IMO of there being a leader of a country that is that suicidal. If there was a nuclear attack by a country, its leadership would be killed quickly. There are vary few countries that would not join in assaulting the place that lanched the attack.\n \n The risk of a terrorist group getting a hold of a nuclear weapon is no higher than it was 10 years ago, but the likelihood of it being used in the US is up.\n \n &#8220;mini-nukes&#8221; have been around since the &#8216;50&#8217;s.

   "Just as during the cold war, the retaliatory factor is what provides the balance. For the sake of theory, assume Bin Laden took out parts of NYC with a nuclear device. Any sane US president would immediately remove the entire Afghanistan/Pakistan border and announce that until Bin Laden was presented to the US, dead or alive, all countries with known sympathies to Bin Laden would have their major population centers removed on a semi-weekly basis. By the time two or three were taken out, a mass hoard of citizens would be scouring every hole in the world. Under the threat of mutilating weapons, somebody would give him up. The world just isn't all that big when proper leverage is applied. The same principle holds true for other countries with nuclear weapons.",

A modern nuke would be incredibly difficult to build without specialised equipment. A Hiroshima type nuke could be literally built at home with shop equipmnet that is commonly available (though expensive). What keeps people from doing it is the lack of weapons grade material, whihc is fairly strictly regulated.",
