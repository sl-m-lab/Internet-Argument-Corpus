   "Gilligan,\n I must agree with Suede. I think that you must at least admit the possibility that our souls go to heaven immediately upon death (after being given a personal judgment). The scripture she/he cited Luke 23:43 states that the thief will be with Jesus today in paradise. And the quote from Revelation states that the martyrs were in heaven under the altar. That is, they were already in heaven before the second coming. \n \n Now, the 1,000 year reign to which you refer is in Revelation 20 but if you read it then you will see this, \"Then I saw thrones, and seated on them were those to whom judgment was committed. Also I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their testimony to Jesus and for the word of God...They came to life, and reigned with Christ a thousand years...This is the first resurrection...\" There were some who had already been judged and they had made it to heaven.\n \n Yes, heaven may come to earth as you say but there is clear scriptural evidence that there will already be souls in heaven from earth when this happens (depending on how literally we can take John's revelation).\n \n peace",

   "Silent Poet,\n \n \n +++- It says 1,000 years in the bible, why would you not beleive it?+++\n \n This is actually a prime reason why need to study the Bible, and listen to what Theologians have to say. Sadly out of all respective fields, Theologians are constantly and consistently ingore. This leads to some of the most ridiculous interpretations of the Bible. But, to answer your question. The number, 1,000, is often used in the Bible symbolically, not literally. It's kind of like how now days we might say \"a couple of items\", though we may in fact be refering to more then two items, despite the fact that two is the literal definition of a couple. Also, the verses that surround the 1,000 years in Revelation 20 are symbolic. Even interpreters that take the 1,000 years as literal, don't deny that the other things listed are symbolic. To me though, the 1,000 years would be symbolic to, and when we look at it elsewhere in the Bible, we see that it is used symbolically. \n \n +++- What in the world is taking so long?
