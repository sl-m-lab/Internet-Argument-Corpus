In school they got 9 to 3 and about 12-14 weks off. \n \n I'd love to hear an argument how giving students less vacation will make them worse students or less productive in the adult workforce.\n\n \n \n \n Classroom education is about more than just teaching facts. No one can claim that it doesn't have a blend of facts and philosophy. The recent controversial Obama loving song being sung by school children is only one example of many. I've heard of, and seen several examples of students (often elementary students) being assigned the task of writing letters to editors of newspapers, explaining why we should pull out of Iraq or Afghanistan, or how dirty the environment is, etc. Another thing that can, and is being done in at least some cases, is for a liberal history teacher to focus on only the negative aspects of U.S. history, making children think the U.S. is a pretty awful country, without really encouraging them to ask \"Compared to what?\" It's not really debatable that some of what goes on in school does more harm than good, at least to a large percentage of those who pay the bills, the parents. \n \n Just as an example, let's generously assume that today's students are getting an 80/20 ratio on their education. (80% facts, 20% liberal indoctrination) If they go longer, is there a guarantee that ratio would stay the same? Of course not, but there's an excellent chance that it would shift towards more indoctrination, considering the certain-to-arise claim that children don't have the stamina and focus that adults do, and therefore all their school time must be balanced with more structured play time, or feel-good philosophy time. \n \n But even with all that aside, I believe children with less free time are less likely to appreciate freedom as adults. If their lives are more structured by others as they're growing up, they're going to be more likely to look for structure from others as adults. It would result in less innovation, fewer new businesses. Summer jobs/after school jobs are the best introduction to the real world that students can get. Too many students today in their mid/late teens are creating new mouths to feed without really knowing that money doesn't grow on trees. More classroom time isn't going to help that problem.",

They found that a whopping 66% were experiencing \"symptoms of burnout, including emotional exhaustion and depression.\" Earlier studies by Laschinger reportedly put burnout rates at 58% of nurses who had been working for a wider range of periods, and 54% of nurse managers. \n The piece also includes material on the larger effects of these trends on the nursing profession. Silas notes that CFNU surveys indicate almost one third of Canadian nurses under 30 want to leave the profession. In addition, \"a predicted slew of early retirements\" by the many nurses over 50 suggest the problem is even more urgent. Silas warns that the system will \"crumble\" unless health care management and policy makers (in the reporter's words) \"quit talking about nursing shortages and [] do something about it.\" That's good, though the piece would have benefited from some response from those managers and policy makers, and perhaps some discussion of potential solutions. \n \n \"By far the worst burnout levels I've ever seen\"\n \n",

Parents still had a say in raising their kids. Teachers didn't whine. Kids took brown bag lunches to school.....the state didn't pay for them. Cafeterias still made their own food instead of concession garbage they have today.

   "Obama thinks children should spend more time in school. \n \n \n \n Is this the \"it takes a village\" mentality? Is it beneficial to Democrats to shorten family time for children, and lengthen their time in a controlled, government setting? It's going to be costly of course, additional staff time, and additional meal programs. Not all childrens time away from school is simply 'play time', or goof off time. Many children actually do accomplish things when they're not in school, especially when they get to their teen years. It's important for at least some children, in a free society, to begin to appreciate what freedom actually is - to be able to make some of their own choices about how to spend their time, without having most all their time planned out by someone else. \n \n If today's children need more education, it's in ethics and morals.

   "Classroom education is about more than just teaching facts. No one can claim that it doesn't have a blend of facts and philosophy. The recent controversial Obama loving song being sung by school children is only one example of many. I've heard of, and seen several examples of students (often elementary students) being assigned the task of writing letters to editors of newspapers, explaining why we should pull out of Iraq or Afghanistan, or how dirty the environment is, etc. Another thing that can, and is being done in at least some cases, is for a liberal history teacher to focus on only the negative aspects of U.S. history, making children think the U.S. is a pretty awful country, without really encouraging them to ask \"Compared to what?\" It's not really debatable that some of what goes on in school does more harm than good, at least to a large percentage of those who pay the bills, the parents.\n\n \n Bingo. I'd like to point out how true the bolded is. This description perfectly fits my AP United States history teacher. She was an excellent teacher who's kids both loved her and scored extremely high on the AP test. But, she was extremely liberal and extremely biased. She was also an excellent orator and debater, and she made very good points. Since I'm mostly liberal, I agreed with most of what she said. But, even I could recognize her heavy bias. Nearly all of the kids, even the conservative ones, came out of that class with a radically different (and negative) view of the United States. The biggest problem with it was that everything she said was true, which made disproving any of it impossible. \n \n \n \nBut even with all that aside, I believe children with less free time are less likely to appreciate freedom as adults. If their lives are more structured by others as they're growing up, they're going to be more likely to look for structure from others as adults. It would result in less innovation, fewer new businesses. Summer jobs/after school jobs are the best introduction to the real world that students can get. Too many students today in their mid/late teens are creating new mouths to feed without really knowing that money doesn't grow on trees. More classroom time isn't going to help that problem.\n\n \n Bingo again. I'm not known for agreeing with Marc, but this time he's spot on.",
