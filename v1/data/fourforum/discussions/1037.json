A gain is deciding you are responsible for yourself and not your family, your government, your brother. A loss is allowing your brother to menace you, your family, and others. Think about it. it is one thing if he shoots you by accident... GAME OVER! but what if he shoots your sister, your wife, your son or daughter.
