   "What the hell is' anti-homophobic bullying policies' in faith schools?\n Is this kind of bullying somehow worse than other forms of bullying?\n \n Sounds like goverrnment by passing parents to indoctrinate their own pc dogma to children.\n How will our busy teachers fit this new indoctrination into their busy schedule?They already seem to be struggling to teach our childen basic maths and English.\n \n Having gay characters in British soaps teach children far more about homosexuals than Mr Chips reading from a reference book.\n Cameron is a Blair wannabe trawling for votes ' lets love gays or be ashamed' to be added to our schools' curriculum is probably another stunt like 'hug a hoodie'.",

   "Is sexual responsibilty, racial tolerance and respect for old people 'embedded' in UK schools...hasnt done much good has it?\n Teachers have no place 'teaching' children morals . They are no more qualified to teach others morals as the local car mechanic.\n And that is what it will amount to.\n Gay relationships and civil partnerships should present their own case for complete public acceptance by example, not by people telling us so.\n \n We should not think they are good because the teacher tells us so..we should think they are good because they ARE.\n As for bullying and harrassment, children should be taught that bullying is wrong for everyone, without exceptions.\n \n I can see little Johnny telling the class that his parents disapprove of gay sex and the teacher thumbing through his telephone book looking for the social services number.",

   "As for bullying and harrassment, children should be taught that bullying is wrong for everyone, without exceptions.\n\n \n I agree, except I'd go one farther and say that it should only be condemned to the extent and situation that it disrupts school itself. IOW, their goal should be educating the kids on the basics of education: math, reading, science, etc. If there's a situation where bullying interferes with that, then it should be dealt with. But in terms of bullying in general (even outside of school) I don't think that should be the teacher's problem. He or she should be about the business of educating them rather than indoctrination and/or moral correction. And of course, that means they have no business taking a stance on the issue of gay-relationships (a moralistic matter).",
