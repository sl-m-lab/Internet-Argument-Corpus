Just as today some renounce or try to keep quite about their faith so that they dont feel disrespected, rejected or hated.

You got into your song and dance about deception again. When you accuse people of lying or being deceptive when they aren't, then you should expect that they probably aren't going to want to engage you because they find you to be a dishonest poster yourself. Debate with integrity and honesty staying on topic, and you'll find people will do the same with you. Quite simply, the choice is yours. emoticon_xgood \n \n \nTo get back to the topic, there is nobody on these message boards that I have seen claim that a debater BEING Christian makes his arguments invalid. When I explicitly tell Steeeeve that I do not have that position, and he continues to claim I do, that is false regardless of quibbling over \"lying\".\n\n \n I didn't say they did. What I said was that people are sometimes turned off on the info of someone claiming to be a Christian and that it can color their judgements and perceptions. I didn't say the views of these Christians would be completely rendered \"invalid\" in the minds of others. What's with this taking things to an extreme here? FWIW, I'm speaking out of my OWN experience here, not just giving random thoughts. I try not to \"obfuscate\", but I do tend to cringe when some people find out I'm a Christian because I know due to the prejudice people sometimes have over it, it colors their judgements in a negative way. Maybe YOU don't think that way, but I believe there are plenty of people out there that do, and I've run into a lot of very anti-Christian attitudes right here in these forums.\n \n \nErgo, it seems Steeeeve's reasoning for obfuscating is based on a false belief.\n I find it difficult to believe that the various people I have seen obfuscate their religion have done so based on a belief that people will disregard their arguments JUST because they are Christian. I find this mostly hard to believe because I have NEVER seen anybody argue that somebody's arguments are invalid because the arguer is Christian...\n\n \n Concerning my own views on the topic of this thread (before you derailed it), I've made my opinions clear, and you haven't don't anything to convince me otherwise.

Second, don't worry about skin color, sex, sexual preference, religion, militiary status...etc when trying to prove a point that doesn't directly involve those (I said directly because the \"Gay Forums\" would always be about gays but one shouldn't have to mention their sexual preference when talking about whether an egg toss at the white house is good or bad...for example).\n \n An easy solution to making your posts and then our posts more respectful.\n \n \n\n People believed the earth was flat. They were wrong.\n If you believe that I have an opinion I do not have, then you are wrong.\n I either have the opinion you claim, or I do not. There is no \"gray\" area there.\n Do YOU see a gray area there?\n There obviously is no gray area. Either I am right or you are right. I am not wrong in having a belief though.

Does that make a difference too?\n\n In the context of the discussion, I explained why I brought it up.\n It was pertinent/relevant.\n \n \n \nExpect when I said \"I don't believe you would accept the easy logic that being a Christian doesn't make an argument any less valid.\" of course.\n\n That doesn't acknowledge the fact that I explicitly said THE EXACT OPPOSITE of what you \"believe\".\n \n \n \n \nNah, I got it...although it has already been stated. Your previous asking and bringing up of me being a Christian give you an inherent bias for some reason.\n\n No. That wasn't it.\n It was an issue regarding how Christians are the majority in this country, and whether or not you would be comfortable with the \"majority\" ruling if it believed something against you.\n \n Like take abortion for example. Or gay rights.\n A majority disapprove of both forms of the abortion spectrum. They want some legal form of abortion, and they do not want unlimited abortion.\n Are you comfortable with the \"majority\" vote on that?\n Or gay rights. The majority approve of gay adoption, gays in the military, and gay civil unions.\n \n \n \nIn general, your posting style and lack of respect when posting lead to this. Your \"jump to conclusions\" style of posting is another reason this comes to be. You do it all the time...instead of figuring out if 1) a person is wrong 2) a person was misunderstood or 3) you are wrong you automatically default to lying (as an example).\n\n 1) You are wrong.\n I never said what you claimed I said.\n I do not have the opinion you claim I have.\n You are wrong.\n \n 2) If you claim I said something that I never did, it would be on you to prove your claim. Your refusal to do that demonstrates it's not an \"honest\" mistake.\n When you claim I have an opinion that I do not have, and then repeatedly claim I have that opinion despite the fact that I don't have that opinion, that ALSO is a lie.\n Or maybe I should just start saying that you like raping kids.\n Would that be a \"lie\"? Would it be a \"lie\" if I honestly believed you liked raping kids?\n \n 3) I know what I said.\n I know what my opinion is.\n I am not wrong on those two issues.\n You have done ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to try and present any evidence that I could be wrong.\n Instead, all you do is claim the contrary, despite the evidence.\n \n \n \nSo when you bring up something about me being Christian (as it has no reason to be brought up) the only reasonable assumption is that you do it as a discredit tactic. \n\n \"as it has no reason to be brought up\"??\n This is a falsehood.\n The context of the discussion was given. It was relevant.\n I NEVER intimated that I was using it as a discredit tactic based on you BEING Christian.\n It questioned the consistency of your opinion based on your MAJORITY status. It would just as equally apply if you were Muslim and we lived in a predominantly Muslim country.\n \n \n \nThere is your brief overview of why I don't believe you. I will even go farther and provide a solution.\n\n How about you provide ACTUAL PROOF.\n QUOTE what was said. Quote WHERE I supposedly said what you claimed.\n Nah. You can't do that.\n You'll just sit back and try to pretend black is white and green is red...\n \n And for the record, your \"brief overview\" was b.s. That's not what happened.\n Luckily, I have posted what DID happen, so others can view and comment for themselves.\n \n \n \nFor one, stop calling people liars because you disagree with their assessment.\n\n What would you like me to call it when you purposely state something explicitly false and inaccurate?\n And how do you define \"lie\"?\n \n \n \nYou can say they are wrong but lying is a totally different animal and I doubt many people lie here on these forums (although many are misguided).\n\n Steeeeve, if we have JUST a disagreement of opinion, I will not call you a liar.\n Whether or not I believe something is not an \"opinion\". It's an issue of fact.\n Whether or not I have said something is not an \"opinion\". It's an issue of fact.\n \n \n \nAn easy solution to making your posts and then our posts more respectful.\n\n Another easy solution is for you to stop claiming I said things I never did, and for you to stop claiming I believe things that I don't.\n \n It shows SERIOUS disrespect when you claim I say things that I haven't, and that I don't believe in.\n \n \n \nThere obviously is no gray area. Either I am right or you are right. I am not wrong in having a belief though. If I believe you to be \"x\" than it is true that I have that belief...maybe not that \"x\" is true though. Nevertheless, if you actually follow the above solution I would probably change my opinion...not that it matters.\n\n Ahhh yes. The ol' \"belief\" escape...\n It allows people to ignore \"right\" and \"wrong\".\n It just comes down to a \"belief\", and the factual nature of \"right\" and \"wrong\" can be ignored...\n \n That's rather \"logical\", wouldn't you say?\n < end sarcasm <\n \n Again, to drive the point home, if I claim that I believe that you like raping kids, is that JUST a \"belief\"?\n Can we ignore the \"right\" and \"wrong\" of the issue and just settle for \"belief\"?\n Can we ignore the fact that I present NO EVIDENCE",
