Now they are taking the lottery money and useing it for other things then the schools like it was set up for. I am all done buying lottery tickets because I pay taxes now for the other services. It should not come out of the lottery money. emoticon_angryAlso you have a better chance of getting hit by a bus in your bedroom than winning the lottery.",
