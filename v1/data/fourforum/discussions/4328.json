   "This has been around for some time now, with variations on the bottom line. It still warms the cockles of the heart.\n \n \n This will warm your heart............... Just when you\n have lost faith in human kindness. Someone who teaches\n at a Middle School in Safety Harbor, Florida forwarded\n the following letter. The letter was sent to the\n principal's office after the school had sponsored a\n luncheon for the elderly. An old lady received a new\n radio at the lunch as a door prize and was writing to\n say thank you. This story is a credit to all human\n kind. Forward to anyone you know who might need a lift\n today! \n \n \n Dear Safety Harbor Middle School: \n \n God bless you for the beautiful radio I won at your\n recent senior citizens luncheon. I am 84 years old and\n live at the Safety Harbor Assisted Home for the Aged.\n All of my family has passed away. I am all alone now\n and it's nice to know that someone is thinking of me.\n God bless you for your kindness to an old forgotten\n lady. My roommate is 95 and always had her own radio,\n but before I received one, she would never let me\n listen to hers, even when she was napping. The other\n day her radio fell off the night stand and broke into\n a lot of pieces It was awful and she was in tears. She\n asked if she could listen to mine, and I told her to\n kiss my XXX. Thank you for that opportunity. \n \n Sincerely, \n \n Edna Walters",
