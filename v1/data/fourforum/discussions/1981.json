   "Let us assume the State of Israel has the right to exist as a Jewish state co-existing in peace with her neighbors. This is clearly not the case today. The real question is how are things going to change for the better on both sides so the people can live in peace and have security co-existing together. Accepting the fact that there are three major parts to the War on Islamic Terrorists that the United States Foreign Policies are directly connected too. The first being the current policies and actions of the State of Israel, the second being tyrannical forms of governments of many Middle Eastern nations and the third being our national energy policies. \n \n More specifically our consumption of so much of the world fossil fuel is crippling many of the other developing nations around the world. With many of the developed industrial nations having little to no native fossil fuel reserves. This is putting economic and political pressure on those nations that have substantial oil reserves. The flow of oil and money going into the hands of a very few people has corrupted the system. In many cases what is political and socially correct has been put on the back burner to guarantee a steady supply of Middle Eastern oil. \n \n The perception of the problem to what is right and wrong will vary according to what side a person?s views it from. The religious indoctrination of the people on both sides has polarized the people even the moderates deepening the divide of the people. Without major policies changes on both sides things will continue to get worse for the people on both sides. Only by making friends out of our enemies will we have a chance for peace and security on a global level. For this to happen we will have to reform the system and policies strengthening the universal system of the global community of nations. \n \n Unless the United States and the State of Israel are willing to lead in changing their ways, the violence of terror will continue to proliferate around the world. Without coming to a peaceful settlement in the Palestinian-Israel Crisis there will be no security or trust on either side deepening the divide. As well without major changes in United States energy policies, the evolution of the Middle Eastern Nations will turn to the worst. There will be no winners in the War on Terror as long as it is fought with armies and bombs. This will only heighten the level of tension in turn strengthening the extremists on both sides. Without recognizing the claims of the people on the other side there will be no answers that will work.",

   "The Cold War was over political ideology communism verses capitalism and the domino theory. We were telling the people on our side the commies were trying to take over the world and they were claiming the capitalists were trying to take over the world and we called it propaganda. Less than 25 years after the end of the cold war we are trying to convert the nations of the world to a democratic capitalist system of government. Since the end of World War II the military battles have been fought with the real wars beginning fought on the economics and political fronts. We no longer colonize nations with armies but economic and political trade agreements that control a nations economy. \n \n Today with the United States Foreign Policy clearly dividing the world?s nations and people. Between our military actions and the State of Israel?s military actions and the political rhetoric coming out of both nations. Most of the nations of the rest of the world are feeling threaten by these policies and actions. Most Arab people and nations do not have to look to far or deep in their region to see the scars of what a democratic militaristic capitalist system of government can do to the people. The Israel government being the only democratic militaristic capitalist in the region not making a good Ambassador to the democratic capitalist form of government. \n \n Many of the religiously indoctrinated American Jewish Temples and people are in the forefront of the War on Islamic Terrorist. With a disproportional amount of influence over the United States Middle East policies they are bringing their religious bias into our policies and position. The United States has armed militarily both sides the Israelis and Arab nations to the point of raising the level of tension to insanity. If the people of the world stand-up and condemn the Israelis for their military assassination of Hamas founder and spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin they are labeled anti-Semites. The Israelis raising the level of tension to the breaking point in the Islamic world in the Middle East and around the world by their military offensive actions. Claiming it is in the name of their national security while endangering everybody else in the world. There is no Homeland Security Agency that can defend and secure the American people while supporting the current extremists policies and action of the State of Israel.",

   "How the self proclaimed ?Moral Majority? uses the name of God and Jesus to make their case for profit and politics. The commercial highflying Christen ministries are using the pulpit to install fear of God into the minds of their followers. Many of the extreme religious leaders today are no different than two thousand years ago in their preaching of hate and contempt for other people who believe differently than they do. Using the words of Gods to defend their actions against another people. The European settlers killed the American Indians in the name of God, as are the Israelis and Palestinians today.\n \n The Christen Right and the Zionist Right have formed a bond of unconditional support in any action the people of Israel take against the Palestinian people. All in the name of their God they kill for land and control over another people. Many people with misconstrued minds gain a great deal of power in the commercial religious and political world. The greed and thirst for more power and the paranoia of losing it, keeps their message on edge of the extreme usually creating tension. Out of tension come conflict and tragedy. The Religious leader want you to turn to them for guidance and strength when they are often the ones that at the root of it. \n \n We see some of the religiously misguide Islamic leaders but we can?t see them in the faith of Judaism or the Christianity. Yet, TV preachers such as Hal Lindsey on Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN) leading us into Armageddon, fulfill their scriptures in the Bible for the second coming of Christ for the Christians and the first coming of Christ for the Jewish people. Without all sides willing to take some blame for the pain on both side there will be no peace or security for those involved. Many of the TV preachers speaking with hollow words to divide the people to build their power. \n \n The standards of good and bad should hold true on both sides equally. To rule out of fear with the big stick will only lead to conflict and war as will one people suppressing another people over time. God would never be so arrogant to say; ?If you do not believe in me, you will go to hell.? Only mankind could be so arrogant to say such a thing.",
