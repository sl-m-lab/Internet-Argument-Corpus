   "By JASON STRAZIUSO, AP\n posted: 22 MINUTES AGOcomments: 170filed under: Pirates News, World News\n Maersk Alabama Targeted by Somali Pirates\n \n NAIROBI, Kenya (Nov. 18) -- Somali pirates attacked the Maersk Alabama on Wednesday for the second time in seven months, though private guards on board the U.S.-flagged ship repelled the attack with gunfire and a high-decibel noise device.\n A U.S. surveillance plane was monitoring the ship as it continued to its destination on the Kenyan coast, while a pirate said that the captain of a ship hijacked Monday with 28 North Korean crew members on board had died of wounds.\n Pirates hijacked the Maersk Alabama last April and took ship captain Richard Phillips hostage, holding him at gunpoint in a lifeboat for five days. Navy SEAL sharpshooters freed Phillips while killing three pirates in a daring nighttime attack.\n Four suspected pirates in a skiff attacked the ship again on Tuesday around 6:30 a.m. local time, firing on the ship with automatic weapons from about 300 yards (meters) away, a statement from the U.S. Fifth Fleet in Bahrain said.\n An on-board security team repelled the attack by using evasive maneuvers, small-arms fire and a Long Range Acoustic Device, which can beam earsplitting alarm tones, the fleet said.\n Vice Adm. Bill Gortney of the U.S. Naval Forces Central Command, said the Maersk Alabama had followed the maritime industry's \"best practices\" in having a security team on board.\n \"This is a great example of how merchant mariners can take proactive action to prevent being attacked and why we recommend that ships follow industry best practices if they're in high-risk areas,\" Gortney said in a statement.\n \n However, Roger Middleton, a piracy expert at the London-based think tank Chatham House, said the international maritime community was still \"solidly against\" armed guards aboard vessels at sea, but that American ships have taken a different line than the rest of the international community.\n \"Shipping companies are still pretty much overwhelmingly opposed to the idea of armed guards,\" Middleton said. \"Lots of private security companies employee people who don't have maritime experience. Also, there's the idea that it's the responsibility of states and navies to provide security. I would think it's a step backward if we start privatizing security of the shipping trade.\"\n A self-proclaimed pirate told The Associated Press from the Somali pirate town of Haradhere that colleagues out at sea had called around 9 a.m. - 21/2 hours after the attack.\n \"They told us that they got in trouble with an American ship, then we lost them. We have been trying to locate them since,\" said a self-described pirate who gave his name as Abdi Nor.\n A U.S. Navy P-3 surveillance aircraft \"is monitoring Maersk Alabama and has good voice communication with the vessel,\" said Lt. Nathan Christensen, the Bahrain-based spokesman for the 5th Fleet.\n \"Everything is safe and secure and Maersk Alabama is proceeding to their intended destination,\" Christensen said. The ship was heading for the Kenyan port town of Mombasa.\n Maritime experts said it was unlucky but not unprecedented that the Maersk Alabama had been targeted in a second attack.\n \"It's not the first vessel to have been attacked twice, and it's a chance that every single ship takes as it passes through the area,\" Cmdr. John Harbour, a spokesman for the EU Naval Force. \"At least this time they had a vessel protection detachment on board who were able to repel the attack.\"\n Phillips' ordeal last spring galvanized the attention of the U.S. public to the dangers of operating merchant ships in the Horn of Africa, one of the busiest and most precarious sea lanes in the world.\n Underscoring the danger, a self-proclaimed pirate said Wednesday that the captain of a ship hijacked Monday had died of wounds suffered during the ship's hijacking. The pirate, Sa'id, who gave only one name for fear of reprisals, said the captain died Tuesday night from internal bleeding.\n The EU Naval Force has said the Virgin Islands-owned chemical tanker the Theresa was taken Monday with 28 North Korean crew.\n Pirates have greatly increased their attacks in recent weeks after seasonal rains subsided. On Tuesday, a self-proclaimed pirate said that Somali hijackers had been paid $3.3 million for the release of 36 crew members from a Spanish vessel held for more than six weeks - a clear demonstration of how lucrative the trade can be for impoverished Somalis.\n Phillips told the AP last month from his farmhouse in Vermont that he was contemplating retiring from sea life after his ordeal. He's been given a book deal and a movie could be in the works.\n Phillips was hailed as a hero for helping his crew thwart April's hijacking before he was taken hostage, but he says he never volunteered, as crew members and his family reported at the time. He says he was already a hostage when he struck a deal with the pirates - trading him for their leader, who was taken by the Maersk Alabama's crew.\n \n Any nits in here sin?",

   "EDITORIAL: An anti-pirate policy that works - Washington Times\n \n \nMerchant ships need guns to fight pirates. Seven months ago, Somali pirates attacked the Maersk Alabama and held its captain hostage. Pirates attacked the Maersk Alabama again this week but were repulsed because the Maersk Shipping Line put armed guards on its ships.\n \n Pirates successfully attacked another unarmed ship on Monday, leaving 28 members of its crew dead. On Tuesday, 36 crew members of a Spanish ship were released only after pirates were paid a $3.3 million ransom. But when the pirates got within 300 yards of the Maersk Alabama, the ship tried evasive maneuvers and its security team successfully engaged in small-arms fire. Vice Admiral Bill Gortney of the U.S. Naval Forces Central Command said the actions of the Maersk Alabama were following the maritime industry's \"best practices.\"\n \n Things have changed a lot since the first Maersk Alabama attack in April. As late as the beginning of 2009, it was very rare for ships to have armed security guards. Now about 20 percent of the vessels off East Africa are armed, though they are almost exclusively American ships. Gun-control advocates warned about having guns on ships, pointing to possible accidents or misuse. As with armed pilots on airplanes, the fear of guns on ships has not been justified by experience.\n \n It is not practical to depend on the Navy to protect merchant shipping. Aside from the enormous cost, Navy ships cannot be everywhere all the time, and they generally arrive on the scene after an initial action has taken place. It is far better for merchant ships to defend themselves, but a major obstacle exists. Many foreign ports do not allow armed vessels to dock. The U.S. government can help by using diplomatic channels to convince other nations to allow entry to lightly armed ships.\n \n Gun-control proponents keep claiming that banning guns will make people safer, but we suspect that as more ships are armed, fewer will be attacked. What gun controllers refuse to admit is that gun-free zones are a magnet for criminals, terrorists and even pirates.\n",

   "Arming ships beats UN whining | The Barr Code\n \n \nWhile bureaucrats at the United Nations continue to wring their hands and whine that arming merchant ships in order to defend their crew and cargo from well-armed Somali pirates infesting the waters off the Horn of Africa will only lead to more violence, at least some US-owned ships are arming their crews and actually employing force to repel the increasingly violent maritime invaders. In the latest episode that has been made known publicly, the Maersk Alabama, which was actually boarded and overtaken by pirates earlier this year (until US Navy SEALS mounted a successful counter-operation), employed both lethal and non-lethal force in thwarting a second capture.\n \n Despite the fact that pirate attacks off the Somali coast have skyrocketed since mid-2008, U.N. bureaucrats and even some U.S. officials maintain that arming ships is not a good idea because it may lead to an \"arms race\" with Somali pirates. This argument ignores the fact that these modern-day buccaneers already have access to late-model, powerful arms. \n \n Unlike UN bureaucrats sitting in their offices overlooking New York's East River, US companies shipping valuable cargo - especially Mideast oil - pay a heavy price for doing nothing and simply relying on naval vessels to protect them, or to meet ransom demands. Somali pirate coffers swell - as do those of the arms dealers and countries from which they purchase their arms - as US and other shipping companies have to spend millions for kidnap and ransom insurance. \n \n Fortunately, many US ship-owning and transport companies are exhibiting a resolve not often seen in this day and age, and are taking the bull by the horns. They are doing what should have been done as soon as this problem of Somali pirating first manifested itself nearly two decades ago; and that is, arming their crews and training them to use those arms to repel pirate attacks. Even the US Coast Guard has indicated support for such steps. \n \n Opponents of arming merchant ships fail to recognize that, just as police cannot be expected to protect every citizen from becoming the victim of a criminal act, warships of the United States Navy, and the navies of other countries with merchant ships plying the dangerous waters in the region, cannot be expected to be everywhere they are needed all the time. Sixteen countries, including the US, already have deployed naval ships to the region, but it is impossible to patrol 1.1 million square miles with complete effectiveness. And, as important as each US-flag merchant ship is, there are priorities elsewhere in the world that our Navy must take into account in determing what resources it can deploy to this area. \n \n Hopefully, the example set by the Maersk Alabama, will cause other countries with a stake in defeating these violent pirate elements to grow some backbone (the UN is beyond hope). More importantly, hopefully we will see the US government become more fully engaged in support of such efforts, including bringing our still-considerable diplomatic power to bear in ensuring that ports at which US merchant ships dock to take on or off load cargo or personnel, are not punished or detained simply because they have defensive firearms locked up on board to be used to defend themselves against pirate attacks.\n",

At any rate .50 BMG rounds cannot shred their hulls emoticon_smile\n\n \n Oh really?\n \n \nNo matter if they can hit airplanes or not they should not be legal under any circumstances. I'm in the Navy and my GQ station was gun mount 103 port bow on the USS Mesa Verde. Anyways, these guns are deadly just plain deadly. One round could tear an arm of a man even if the round was 3 feet away from him. It could put holes in destroyers hulls and shred people in a manner of seconds.\n",

Yeah I was referring to automatic 50 cal's not bolt action rifles or other variations.\n \n A .50 cal machine gun could damage a hull but not in that severity that I mentioned. So I admit that I was mistaken emoticon_smile \n \n Oddly enough though I still don't understand why the design on some destroyers have thinner hulls than some of their previous designs.. Is it in the materials used? \n \n I'd like to know the reasoning behind that actually.",
