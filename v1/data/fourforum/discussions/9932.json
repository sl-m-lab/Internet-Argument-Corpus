And yet consider your religion the most \"tolerant\" and \"loving.\"\n \n While modern science, history, geology, biology, physics and textual scholarship fail to convince you that the Bible may be less than reliable, some idiot rolling around on the floor speaking in \"tongues\" is all the evidence you need to \"prove\" Christianity.\n \n You define 0.01% as a \"high success rate\" when it comes to answered prayers. You consider that small percentage to be evidence enough that prayer works. And you think that the remaining 99.99% FAILURE rate was simply God saying \"No.\"\n \n You actually know a lot less than many atheists and agnostics do about the Bible, Christianity, and church history, but still call yourself a Christian.\n",

   "See I see a God and a Jesus that encompasses all faiths.\n \n \n Then you don't see the God or Jesus of the Bible because HE said have no other Gods before me. You speak with a religious ferver yet deny the power that comes with the truth. You deceive yourself as you align yourself with the enemies of God and post anti-christian material while claiming to know Him. Lie to yourself Matt, but don't you dare try to lie to me because I can see right through your sanctimonious facade.\n \n \n\n Jhn 14:6 Jesus said to him, \"I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.\n \n\n \n \nI also have the wisdom to understand that what is my business is my business and if someone else wants to worship a tree that is there choice and none of my busisness.\n \n \n That isn't wisdom Matthew. It's the foolishness of the Worlds system that say's whatever you do is fine, just don't judge what I do either. You blindly tolerate the sins of others as an expression of a non existent love you claim to have for them, as they tolerate your sinful lifestyle in the same manner. Love is honest and shares the truth. It corrects and teaches a different way to live. It doesn't encourage sin and accept what is evil as good. But you can't even recognize that can you Matt. \n \n \n Eze 22:3 Then say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD: \"The city sheds blood in her own midst, that her time may come; and she makes idols within herself to defile herself.\n Eze 22:4 You have become guilty by the blood which you have shed, and have defiled yourself with the idols which you have made. You have caused your days to draw near, and have come to the end of your years; therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations, and a mockery to all countries.\n\n \n \nI do not go around condeming others unless they have condemed me.\n \n \n You see, that's the difference between us Matt, I don't condemn people even when they do condemn me. it is their sins that convict and condemn them and they, like you, hate anyone who warns of the dangerous path they're on.\n \n \nbtw did you not read some of the lines in the posting? The whole point of the post was to point out that to others christianity is just as wacked as some christians believe other religions are.\n \n \n Of course I know and understand that to some Christianity is whacked Matt. Meri is as big a pagan reprobate as you are, only she doesn't hide behind the facade of Christianity as you do. Only you could claim to believe in and speak of Christ's love and post this thread in order to serve the will of those you know hate what Christ represents. The blatant hypocrisy is mind numbing yet you can't even recognize it in yourself.\n \n \nIf you respect that everyone has their own religious beliefs and that religion is a private matter then you have no problem with any of the lines in the post.\n \n \n I don't respect that there are a hundred or a thousand ways to God Matt, because He say's \"there is but on mediator between God and Man, and that is the Man Christ Jesus.\" So why would i respect all the other ways to get to hell if I truly have the love of God in me and Love all people as He first loved me ? Why would I say I love you and then support your false beleifs that will only condemn you ? I wont ever try to FORCE you to accept my God, but don't ever expect me to remain silent and just condone sin.\n \n \nI think you only have a problem with them because they strike at your fear based, judgemental, exclusionary version of christianity;that you see yourself in the post.\n\n \n What is fear based or exclusionary about a God who gave His own Life so that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life Matt ? What is judgmental about God accepting all people exactly as they are and assuring them that there is nothing they must do to be good enough for Him because He Himself has paid the price for them. \n \n All they must do is receive the free gift. Only someone who claims to know Him but knows nothing in reality would slander such a gracious God as this. You have lied about my God and you have lied about my beliefs Matt. You have proven there is no truth in you at all. \n \n \nIt would look like the devils work to someone who believes God is some blood thirsty monster and expects others to adhere to that belief.\n\n \n Anything that is designed to mislead people from seeing and following the truth is the devils work Matthew. So you, while you claim a knowledge and love for Jesus have posted something that is designed specifically to mock christians, christianity, and by default, Christ Himself. If you can't see that, then you are so blind, and in such denial you're not worth even communicating with. And if you reread this post, it is only you who have referred to God as a \"blood thirsty monster\", not me. My God is a God of mercy and Grace.",

I'm glad to see that we agree. The followers of that list are indeed not Christian even though they accuse other Christians of not being 'true.' That clears things up quite a bit.\n \n No, we do not agree.\n \n Let's clarify what you mean by a \"true Christian\".

I assume you mean someone who always succeeds in to living up to the moral standards that are expressed in the teachings of Jesus.\n\n \n Not at all. 'True' Christian is a fallacy. Just like the Scotsman one. Christanity is subject to interpretation. What qualifies as a 'true' is depends on the person. The only one who CAN make a objective distinction is assuming it exists, is God. Furthermore, what Jesus taught is also subject to interpretation as well. We have Christians here who think they are doing a good following Christ yet regularly practice dishonesty, hate and general things most of us don't consider to be the teachings of Christ. As I'm not God, I can't make a objective distinction as to what really qualifies. I have my opinions based on Christian history and doctrine as to what a Christian should be but I'm not going to say with absolute claim that someone is or isn't. It is my fallible opinion that some people here aren't Christians even though they claim to me. \n \n \nNow someone who abandons those teachings in their entirety is obviously no longer entitled to describe himself as a Christian.\n\n \n Entitled? Doesn't mean they can't do it. \n \n \nBut does someone who is trying to live a Christian life yet not succeeding in various respects, deserve to be pilloried as a hypocrite?\n\n \n Depends. As I understand it, Christians are suppose to know they they are hypocrites. They are also suppose to try to stop that behavior. From what I can see of the list followers here, they don't try to do this and actually continue to behave in ways that are hypocritical. Everyone is a hypocrite. But not everyone tries to mitigate and lower that behavior. For instance, Arch has been caught using several known frauds. Yet after he was informed of his incorrect statements, he kept using them and making more without checking his facts. That's not a sign of trying to lower such dishonest behavior. \n \n \nHowever, if you want to stand by it, then it's up to you to show that it's true. I don't think you can.\n\n \n To do so, we'd need to define what a model Christian behaves like and then compare it to those who follow that statement. \n \n [qupte]I don't think your criticisms of Archangel and EZ, as representative Christians here, amount to anything more than your personal opinion or even prejudice.[/quote]\n \n Of course.

   "1. The \"left\" is anything but a meaningless term.\n\n \n The left has come to mean anything someone doesn't like, similar to the right. These terms are meaningless. Furthermore, politics in the US is better described as a four quadrant graph rather then a two point spectrum. A social liberal, fiscal conservative is a libertarian. A social conservative, fiscal liberal is neocon. Very different but often referred to as both of on the right. These terms are essentially meaningless as they assume the right and left are homogeneous. \n \n \nEconomically speaking the president is a lefter. And his abandoning conservative fiscal attitude may cost the Republican party it's life.\n\n \n And he's a social conservative whore who has flip flopped to get votes despite his previous attitudes and current attitudes he keeps in private. If the GOP loyalists knew his actual attitudes on abortion and gay marriage, they'd abandon him. \n \n \n2. Christianity is not an organization that \"assumes\" power over individuals to reel them in.\n\n \n Have you heard of a thing called the Catholic Church? \n \n \nIslam, however, if you get reeled in, it won't be for opposing a woman's right to kill her child or a homo's rights or verbalizing support of Sharia Laws which will kill you for adultery, being homo, ect. ect. To compare the two may make you appear to be a left wing whacko attempting to legitimize your stances with confusion.\n\n \n Apparently you do not understand the concept of 'reel in.' Neither Christanity nor Islam take a noticeable stand against injustices committed in their names. Islam refuses to issue a fatwa against Bin Laden. Goldwater was effectively ignored about his statements about Falwell. Sure neither are monoliths, but the populations of both do very little to at least speak out against the crazies in their ranks. What happened when the Catholic molester was given the position of speaking John Paul II's Eulogy? Very little outrage by the Christian groups. A huge amount by those opposed to the Church. Funny how that works. \n \n \n3. Perhaps you should share your reasons for \"liking Jews\" in a new thread. It would be interesting and probably informative.\n\n \n Because Jews for the most part speak out against the whackjobs in their religion. Numerous American jewry organizations have issues letters and proclamations against the actions of Israel. Good luck finding Christian and Muslims groups that will do that on such a scale. Plus Jews are non-evangelical for the most part. I like that. And they understand their history for the most part. I definitely cannot say that for Islam or Christanity. \n \n \n4. Nor can you control Christianity. Ignore criticism of Islam? What criticism? Your comments have been the only criticism of Islam I've seen by the left.\n\n \n This is my point about the left. You use the term to describe people you disagree with. I'm solidly pro-free trade, anti-welfare, pro-small government, anti-subsidies, libertarian and you consider me on the left. The left is used by people like you as a classification tool to avoid debate. I hate the current administration because it is a bunch of liberals. They defecate and #### on Conservatism every single day and I cannot support their actions. Yet you consider ME to be on the left.\n \n I have a theory: when a republican encounters a conservative, they label them on the left in the hopes that the audience doesn't understand conservatism and can't see that the Republican is a flaming liberal. \n \n \nThe left defends Islam when the west punishes them for killing our people and criticize them only when attempting to compare them to Christianity.\n\n \n You have a warped perception. People criticize the West for its meddling in the East which is partially the reason they hate us. We rebelled against the British because they kept meddling in our business and did not grant us the ability to make our decisions. That is somewhat similar to what the West did in the Middle East. This is also a reason why China's not experience the kind of outright hatred we're getting: they treat things as business and let the governments and people do what they want instead of shoving down our beliefs down their throats. And the West should be free to bomb the #### out of people who threaten us. We just should do it in a non counterproductive way. Kill 15 terrorists but don't create 20 more. \n \n \nChristians will defend themselves and their beliefs in word and most will quietly try to rationalize the ideas of those in opposition more in an attempt to not rock the boat to hard. Try criticism of Sharia law or Islam to a Muslim.\n\n \n Sharia is a abomination. Just like radical Christan theocratic law. And you're forgetting that in early Christian history, the Church dealt with dissenters in much the same way Sharia deals with dissenters. Christanity and Islam are really not all that different when it comes to how they act. Their histories are filled with blood. There's a reason why many on the left support the reformers of Islam. It took Christanity a couple hundred years to move out of the \"dissent and you die\" stage and they are trying to move Islam the same way. This is a reason why many people dislike Bush. His axis of evil speech was a key reason why there's a whackjob in Iran instead of the reformers who were pushing Democracy. Prior to his speech Iran was considered the #1 country to go democratic in the ME. We could have had a friendly democracy there. Now the Theocracy is far stronger then it was a decade ago.",

   "Does this mean that \"true\" Christianity boils down to whatever individual people say or think it is - whether they happen to be Christians or not? In other words, it's just another example of relativist thinking?\n\n \n Sort of. My belief as to what a 'true' Christian is differs from Arch's and differs from yours. A objective understanding would first require the knowledge that Christanity is true and which doctrine is right. As we don't have that, no one except the Christian God (assuming it exists) can know what a 'true' Christian actually is. Everything else is just speculation, hence why those who absolutely state who is and who isn't and what beliefs are and aren't is delusional. \n \n \nIf this were true, there would be no fundamental agreement on what constitutes Christian faith and morals\n\n \n Good job. Welcome to the status of contemporary Christanity. Without the threat of violence, excommunication and execution, there's nothing to prevent Christians from interpreting the religion in their own way to come to very different outcomes. This status existed prior to the fall of the Roman Empire and before the Roman Catholic Church subjugated all the sects it could get its hands on. In many ways, Christanity has returned to its middle-early stage. \n \n \nand no viable Christian institutions.\n\n \n This I disagree with. A viable Christian institution just requires like minded followers. One sect may disagree with another on many points but still believes in Christ. Orthodox Russian Christanity is considerably different from Evangelical Protestantism. Arianism did not accept Catholic Trinity. Marcion's version of Christanity stripped out all of the Jewish aspects. All were viable at some point in time. All you need for a viable sect is just a bunch of people who believe. \n \n \nThe fact that there is a consensus on what most (if not all) Christian beliefs mean and entail, is something you need to explain away.\n\n \n That God of the Bible exists yes. The rest differs from sect to sect. \n \n \nThe question of whether Christians can prove their beliefs are true is logically independent of the question of what is meant by a \"true Christian.\"\n\n \n How so? If we lack the ability to prove that a religion is true, we therefore lack the ability to prove what is specifically is composed of. Without that, we cannot objectively see how people match up. \n \n \n i.e. someone who always succeeds in living up to the moral standards expressed in the teaching of Jesus Christ. I admit that definition might need sharpening up if there appears to be some ambiguity in Christ's message, but at least it's a foundation which hasn't sunk in the swamp of relativism.\n\n \n But we run into a problem, what constitutes the teachings of Christ and how could they be interpreted? Not to mention which lessons are more important? Do some lessons not apply? This is the problem of interpretation. \n \n Plus an Arian could follow everything Christ did and deny Trinity and he'd be considered a Heretic by the Catholic Church. A eastern Orthodox could follow everything but accept some radically different views, such as mysticism which is heretical to some Southern US Christian groups. Groups calling other groups not True Christians despite their following of Christ. Mormons are often not considered Christian despite following Christ even if they follow the teachings. Christian groups themselves cannot agree as to what qualifies as Christian, much less a true Christian. \n \n \nI have to emphasise that many people are doing the best they can to live a Christian life, and we shouldn't expect more.\n\n \n It's not the act of imitation, it's the failure to reduce the acts of rejection. People will fail to emulate Christ. It's just that some people try to reduce this rate of failure. Others will seek to increase it. Constantly lying is not a sign of active attempts to reduce rejection. Especially after being reminded of that lesson of honesty. A company could say that it is try to reduce the control problem in its accounting system. If they constantly fail 404 audits over a long period of time, are they actually trying to reduce these control problems? Not likely. Compliance is much the same way with following Christ. People will fail, it's just that some will try to fail less. And some people will just talk about following Christ without actually doing so.\n \n \nOn a personal note, I don't think I'm entitled to describe myself as a Christian because I don't love my neighbour, I don't forgive my enemies, I don't give money to the poor, and I don't go to church.\n\n \n We share a sizable amount of things, except that I donate stuff and money on occasion. \n \n \nBut I did have a Christian education and I haven't entirely abandoned Christian ethics or my belief in a Supreme Creator.\n\n \n One can abandon the belief in the Christian God without abandoning the morals and ethics.

This is the problem of interpretation.\n\n \n Oh come on. This is what I don't get. Do you really think most of what Jesus said was that vague? Do you really think it's so hard to interpret things like \"love thy neighbor\" and \"pray for those who persecute you\" and do unto others as you would have them do unto you\"? What possible other interpretations of such things can you come up with? It's not like it's vague in what it means. I'll grant you that there are a few things that are less straightforward, such as the oft-quoted-by-critics passage where Christ claims he's here to bring division in the world. But these passages are fewer and far between; just on numbers of his teachings alone the overwhelming share of admonitional teaching is straightforward.\n \n \nPlus an Arian could follow everything Christ did and deny Trinity and he'd be considered a Heretic by the Catholic Church.\n\n \n In that case though, he'd be denying parts of the Bible (the New testament, for that matter!)--which describe God in terms of Father, Spirit, and Son. Again, it's not like that's not easily verified. Want references to God the Father? Want references to the Son of God? And references to the Spirit of God? It's not hard to confirm.\n \n \nA eastern Orthodox could follow everything but accept some radically different views, such as mysticism which is heretical to some Southern US Christian groups.\n \n Arians ...\n \n Mormons ... \n\n \n At this point you've ignored the fact and importance of the fundamentals. Before you give the predictable answer that not everyone agrees on these, I would say there ARE fundamentals that all Christians DO agree on. There are some fundamentals that a person has to hold to be Christian in their beliefs. For instance, they have to believe in God as creator, the Son of God, and the Spirit, and that God's Son came and died for people, and that he rose from the dead. Those are indispensable. If they don't believe that stuff, they essentially are believing in opposition to the New Testament scriptures, and therefore cannot reasonably be called \"Christian\". This is the very reason the creeds were put together to help protect genuine Christian belief from heresy. I've done a lot of studying on early Christian history; the Roman creed, the Apostle's Creed, and later the Nicene Creed were all consistent with the earliest and purest form of Christianity. There is consistency from the 1st century all the way through orthodoxy down through the creeds; the heresies (such as Arianism which you mentioned) were movements away from this. A lot of times critics of Christianity who haven't really read much early church writings make the argument that the heresies might as well have been the true deal, rather than orthodoxy. But it doesn't take a lot of reading of the earliest century writings to realise that this was not the case. The creeds were written to reflect what had been orthodoxy until the heresies threatened it, not the other way around.\n \n \nGroups calling other groups not True Christians despite their following of Christ. \n\n \n But that's what you're doing. You do that every time you say Arch isn't a True Christian (whether he is or isn't). That's why I pointed out earlier that your reasoning invalidates your own argument against him and others.",

If one denies a doctrine that was enforced by the sword, does that make them heretics to the actual religion? This has always been my problem with Trinity. A ideology that was made mainstream by a \"accept or we kill you\" attitude and method hardly smells of truth. \n \n \nAgain, it's not like that's not easily verified. Want references to God the Father? Want references to the Son of God? And references to the Spirit of God? It's not hard to confirm.\n\n \n Same could be said for passages were Jesus talks about God leaving him. \n \n \nAt this point you've ignored the fact and importance of the fundamentals.\n\n \n What do you consider to be fundamentals? (again, back to my point about interpretation). \n \n \nBefore you give the predictable answer that not everyone agrees on these, I would say there ARE fundamentals that all Christians DO agree on. There are some fundamentals that a person has to hold to be Christian in their beliefs. For instance, they have to believe in God as creator, the Son of God, and the Spirit, and that God's Son came and died for people, and that he rose from the dead.\n\n \n I take you have little understanding of the history of Early Christanity eh not to mention how Trinity came to be? \n \n \nThose are indispensable.\n\n \n More like that's what the RCC wanted you to think. \n \n \nIf they don't believe that stuff, they essentially are believing in opposition to the New Testament scriptures, and therefore cannot reasonably be called \"Christian\".\n\n \n So one can only be a Christian if they accept a doctrine enforced by violence? It appears Trinity is your trump card as to what is and what is not a Christian. \n \n \nThis is the very reason the creeds were put together to help protect genuine Christian belief from heresy.\n\n \n No, the creeds were put together to ensure the domination of the Catholic Church as to all matters of Christanity and their secular outputs. It amazes me how badly Christians fail to understand their own religion's history. Arian, Marcion and whole laundry list of others threatened the dominance Catholicism over the growing Christian population. Arianism was even state supported by several late Roman Imperial families. Trinity was nothing more then a tactic to strip challengers of Christianity's leadership of their power. \n \n \nI've done a lot of studying on early Christian history\n\n \n It doesn't look like it at all as you appear to not even understand the basics of how Catholicism's secular concerns governed their actions. \n \n \nthe Roman creed, the Apostle's Creed, and later the Nicene Creed were all consistent with the earliest and purest form of Christianity.\n\n \n According to whom? Catholicism? OF COURSE.\n \n \nThe creeds were written to reflect what had been orthodoxy until the heresies threatened it, not the other way around.\n\n \n And you learned this where? Catholic school yes? Not surprising. \n \n \nBut that's what you're doing.\n\n \n Not at all. I don't know what a true Christian is. I don't even know what a Christian is beyond a follower of Christ. \n \n \nYou do that every time you say Arch isn't a True Christian (whether he is or isn't). That's why I pointed out earlier that your reasoning invalidates your own argument against him and others.\n\n \n Based on a history of Catholicism justifying its own actions while ignoring what they were really for.",

   "Sort of. My belief as to what a 'true' Christian is differs from Arch's and differs from yours. A objective understanding would first require the knowledge that Christanity is true and which doctrine is right. As we don't have that, no one except the Christian God (assuming it exists) can know what a 'true' Christian actually is. Everything else is just speculation, hence why those who absolutely state who is and who isn't and what beliefs are and aren't is delusional. \n \n Whatever you mean by \"objective understanding\" - and I've assumed it means something like seeking an objective assurance - it evidently omits the role of faith. While the sociology of religion has among its goals an objective understanding of religious behaviour etc., a religious account of our place in the world from the believer's perspective, resists scientific enquiry because it deals with questions of purpose and meaning. Christians don't acquire their religious belief on the basis of a sociological analysis of its functions etc. When people set out in search of meaning and purpose, it is not an objective, scientific, analytical, statement that they require. \n \n \nWelcome to the status of contemporary Christanity. Without the threat of violence, excommunication and execution, there's nothing to prevent Christians from interpreting the religion in their own way to come to very different outcomes. This status existed prior to the fall of the Roman Empire and before the Roman Catholic Church subjugated all the sects it could get its hands on. In many ways, Christanity has returned to its middle-early stage. \n \n This I disagree with. A viable Christian institution just requires like minded followers. One sect may disagree with another on many points but still believes in Christ. Orthodox Russian Christanity is considerably different from Evangelical Protestantism. Arianism did not accept Catholic Trinity. Marcion's version of Christanity stripped out all of the Jewish aspects. All were viable at some point in time. All you need for a viable sect is just a bunch of people who believe. \n \n I don't think it's true that no consensus exists on what it means to be a Christian. Your characterization of contemporary Christianity is a travesty propelled on a rising crescendo of nonsense. If the Christian religion was as incoherent as you pretend, then communities of believers with a shared understanding of their faith couldn't exist. \n \n The fact that Christianity has splintered into many sects does not mean that the core values or principles of the Christian message are always understood or acted upon in contradictory ways. For example on theological matters, there is a lot more that unites members of the Anglican church with Roman Catholics and Greek Orthodox than what divides them. \n \n \nBut we run into a problem, what constitutes the teachings of Christ and how could they be interpreted? Not to mention which lessons are more important? Do some lessons not apply? This is the problem of interpretation. \n\n It seems trite to say this, but what constitutes the teachings of Jesus is recorded in the gospels. If you want to cast doubt on the authenticity of the gospels, then this discussion will go off on another tangent. The problems of interpretation where they arise, are grist to the mill of religious scholarship.\n \nIt's not the act of imitation, it's the failure to reduce the acts of rejection. People will fail to emulate Christ. It's just that some people try to reduce this rate of failure. Others will seek to increase it. Constantly lying is not a sign of active attempts to reduce rejection. \n\n Why should trying to reduce the rate of failure (to imitate Christ) be grounds for criticism? Others seeking to increase failure? Constantly lying? It's not at all clear what points you're making here.\n \n \nWe share a sizable amount of things, except that I donate stuff and money on occasion. \n \n One can abandon the belief in the Christian God without abandoning the morals and ethics. You make not like the restaurant, but its food is still good.\n\n As I explained I don't live a Christian life, but I believe I'd be a better person if I did. \n \n James.",

Every Christian I know bases their belief in the trinity on what the Bible says, not what the RCC says or what they did after Constantine.

To deny any of those three is to deny the New Testament scriptures and things that Jesus Himself talked about.\n \n \nNo, the creeds were put together to ensure the domination of the Catholic Church as to all matters of Christanity and their secular outputs.\n\n \n Well sure, why shouldn't it?

Do you see a serious conflict here?\n \n And the groups that disagreed with Trinity were using the same texts, the same words, the same everything and came to a different conclusion, 'of like but not the same.' This leads back into my interpretation issue.\n\n \n Look, the Bible says what it says, and in this case it really does describe God in terms of Father, Son, and Spirit. That's not the RCC talking; that's the Bible. And, regarding any counter-argument, there is nowhere I know of in the Bible where it says God is NOT Father, NOT son, and NOT Spirit. I don't see how a different conclusion could possibly be reached other than God being Father, Son, and Spirit. What are these so-called 'different conclusions' and what are their scriptural basis? You have to understand that the scriptures used to support God as Father, Son, and Spirit were universally accepted for the most part, other than maybe by fringe groups. We're talking about books like the gospels, and, say, Genesis, for goodness' sake, not some rogue books.\n \n Now you've brought up yet another independent issue, that of the scriptural canon. One of the specific tests for canonicity was that it had to be a book that was universally accepted by individual Christian groups already. That's why when someone brought an obscure book to the table that, say, only 10% of churches used, it probably didn't make it into the cannon. There were other tests too--I've outlined all the tests in posts here before, more than once I believe. Now what would you have them do? Accept even obscure books rather than books that held to more universal orthodoxy? Someone's views had to win the day--it only makes sense that universal acceptance and general orthodoxy do so. Now again, that's not to say that abusing power was ok; that's a different issue than the debate over the canon. Of course ethical standards should always have been followed, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't have used the books we now accept. \n \n There's been a lot of historical revisionism that has gone on that vilifies the early church, and I think you've apparently fallen prey to it a bit too much. Yes, the institutional RCC that happened after Constantine got out of control and abused it's power at times. But we need to not let imagination carry us away in terms of what happened, either. Abuse at certain times doesn't mean there wasn't mostly universal acceptance over most of the books in our canon (and there was). Arianism was wrong, because it flat-out ignored what the accepted scriptures said, in that Arius believed the Son was inferior to the Father and that he had not eternally been existent with the Father. This flat-out ignores John chapter 1, and John was clearly written before 150.",

If Trinity was so inherent, why did the RCC have to resort to what Islam did to convert people?\n \n A doctrine enforced by violence is often not true.\n\n \n There are many answers to this, we many not know the actual truth.\n The one pushed by 'bible' Christians is that many wolves posing as Christians would arise from many sources, even from the ranks of their own congregations to lead many astray.\n Paul rants about the 'Super Apostles' who went about, claiming to be Christian but merely being self serving aspostates milking their brethern for 'filthy lucre'. It is believed that some were gnostics.\n Even one of Jesus own desciples, Thomas (the doubter IIRC) was a gnostic who had a different view of whom Jesus was. \n \n Church leaders and followers were constantly told to shun such people even though they claimed to be Christian too for they actually weren't. But, like many of their kind today, they are very glib and have personal magnatism.\n Where right or wrong, with heirarchial approval or not, eventually some felt they could not simply shun them or cast them aside. Loopholes and even edicts led to conflict.\n The councils to decide what books went into the bible had several determiners on what would be accepted and what would be discarded. The fact that they even felt the need to form a bible shows that there WAS division in the Church over what to believe and what not too. Heretics and Orthodoxy wasn't as clean cut as you seem to be aware of. When you have some demogogue rousing the followers down what is believed a blind path, you set forth to have an 'official' rule book to help combat this. Thus the books of the bible were selected. In them, the 'definition' of trinity is spelt out. \n Those who disagreed with the selected books or who had a conflicting tradition would come into conflict with each other as they sought to convert from the same pool of people.\n Nothing different than similar conflicts over resources and the age old us vs them thing that often leads to bloodshed regardless of intentions.\n A few fights lead to reprisals and counter reprisals...\n You could (and it was) easily justify a little blood on your hands and committing a 'smaller' sin to save countless souls down the road. \n I recall one crusader who forced the conversion of ~100,000 Muslims to Christianity then had them all killed so they wouldn't 'backslide'. Pretty big sin, murdering and all...but, by his logic, he ensured all those new Christians a place in heaven. \n \n Whether you desire to believe in the nonsense in any form is one up to you. \n \n I'm just commenting on what the (current) bible actually says and pushes.\n \n The same arguements could be brought up over Judas the Iscariot. Was he a corrupt individual who had Satan enter him so as to betray the Christ as the bible says or, was he a trusted ally of Jesus who undertook a harsh request to turn his master in so that scripture could be fulfilled which (IIRC) is the story pushed in recently deciphered Koptic texts.\n \n For all anyone knows, the truth of Jesus could have died with one sect nearly 2,000 years ago as you imply.\n \n And personally, any doctrine enforced with violence IS truth...because at the heart of all matters, Might Makes Right. emoticon_xangel",

It does matter if you murder one person, let alone 10 million. Christians believe in the possiblity of God's forgiveness and redemption for those who truly repent. \n \n Socialism isn't a necessary evil. It's a political and economic theory which lacks the pragmatic character of conservatism. \n \n \nSomeone who has been shown to be spreading falsehoods keeps spreading falsehoods at the same or increasing rates, have they strove to be like Christ? \n \n No.\n \nNot true. I didn't say that. I asked YOU what YOU thought of the message. Big difference.\n \n I haven't the leisure to comb through all of your posts in this thread, but here's a sample from three of them\n \n \nAnd what per se IS the Christian message my dear? (#81)\n \n But we run into a problem, what constitutes the teachings of Christ and how could they be interpreted? (#53)\n \n I have no idea what a true Christian is. (#44)\n\n \n In order to enlighten you, I referred you to the gospels in general and to the Sermon on the Mount in particular. Find out for yourself. If I could supply my understanding of the Christian message (in its entirety?), I guess, on previous form, you would immediately respond that it was merely my interpretation and that there are many others.....etc.....etc. So I'll save you the trouble of making that riposte. \n \n I think we've reached a point where we are beginning to bore each other, and your continuous changes of tack, non sequiturs, and amusing irrelevancies have lost their novelty value.\n \n Thanks for the discussion but I'm going to retire from this thread now, and leave you to conclude by going off at the most bizarre tangent you can devise. \n \n James.",

   "If they don't attempt to save themselves from falls (or what Christians call \"sin\"), then they are failing in their Christian obligations and must, with a firm purpose, amend their ways.\n\n \n Does a failure still get into Heaven? What is someone does not wish to amend their ways? \n \n \nChristians believe in the possiblity of God's forgiveness and redemption for those who truly repent.\n\n \n True socialism. \n \n \nSocialism isn't a necessary evil. It's a political and economic theory which lacks the pragmatic character of conservatism.\n\n \n Are you saying that Socialism in itself is not evil? A political and economic theory can be evil in what it describes. \n \n \nI haven't the leisure to comb through all of your posts in this thread, but here's a sample from three of them\n\n \n The first is as I have stated, a question to you about what the message is. \n The second is similar in that interpretations may differ. My belief of the message is very different then AA. How do we know who is right? \n And the last doesn't mean I do not have a idea of what the message is, just that the 'true' aspect is unknowable. \n \n Of all people, how can you not see the big differences? Furthermore, I have already stated what I believe the message to be. I have also stated I do not know for sure that it is the actual message. I have clearly stated it was my opinion, not fact or absolutist like AA does all the time. \n \n \nI guess, on previous form, you would immediately respond that it was merely my interpretation and that there are many others.....etc.....etc. So I'll save you the trouble of making that riposte\n\n \n That is my point. I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm not saying anyone is wrong (outside of literal genesis). My whole argument revolves around the inability for us to know exactly what the message is, what the religion describes and what the correct interpretation is. Therefore without this knowledge, no one can make absolutist statement about what a 'true' Christian is. Anyone who does is delusional. \n \n \n and amusing irrelevancies have lost their novelty value.\n\n \n I could say the same about you. Not to mention your inability to stay on the major point of lack of knowing the 'truth.'\n \n So you consider constant referrals to the original argument bizarre tangents?\n \n Right.......",
