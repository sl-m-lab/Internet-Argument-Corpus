I would be gone in a flash if I had them.) Homosexuals in general have been persecuted by and large throughout history, and as a result, we're rather touchy about such things, as a Jew would be about a neo-nazi rally in town. We are people too, and when others start to try to deny that, it's quite the thorn in the side.\n As an aside, to answer your point about how we gays are making such a stink about things, let me take things to the playground.\n On the playground, a child is bullied by another kid, and this has been going on for a long time. Let's say that the kid being bullied is named X and the bully is Y. X has been bullied for years and years, and has kept relatively silent because all of his teachers through the years were unreceptive to his comments.

It's true that religious faiths are rather disapproving of homosexuality, but if you take into account that these religions came into existence at a very early period in human history when not much was known about anything, that will explain why. Homosexuality was seen as a sin because, according to the bible, it would contribute to wasted seed, as in a man's sperm, and if it wasn't used to create new people, it was a waste. So masturbation was also another no no; but nowadays it is for the most part acceptable. (You just normally don't bring it up over dinner, though.)\n And it's not unnatural, for the umpteenth time. Other beings than humans have exhibited homosexuality, most notable are penguins and monkeys. \n And about the non-religious people who think it's unnatural: More often than not you see that they are uneducated, or have inherited prejudices from their parents or peers, or from the world around them. Do little kids start off thinking homosexuality is normal? They don't even know what it is! There was a thread were the author was complaining about how Spongebob is gay. Kids can't tell the difference! They're taught these prejudices, taught bigotry. It is not ingrained into human nature to hate one thing or another; we are molded by our society.

Science has no business guiding moral values; in fact in many cases science itself needs to be guided by moral values (e.g. ethical oversight). It may be easy for someone who doesn't believe in God to just throw the moral views of the Bible right out the window as soon as something comes along indicating the behavior in question might be genetically influenced. But for many of us who believe in a higher power, we feel people are not slaves to their genetics and morality is not based on genetics or what feels natural to a person. There are many examples of behavior that might feel natural to people but that doesn't mean it's acceptable or right behavior.\n \n \nHomosexuality was seen as a sin because, according to the bible, it would contribute to wasted seed, as in a man's sperm, and if it wasn't used to create new people, it was a waste.\n\n \n I don't think the Bible ever gives this as a justification for it's view of homosexual behavior being a sin. \n \n \nAnd it's not unnatural, for the umpteenth time. Other beings than humans have exhibited homosexuality, most notable are penguins and monkeys.\n\n \n Well, it might not be unnatural for animals, but there are many behaviors that various animals exhibit that we in the human race would consider to be unnatural for humans to do. So the argument that \"the animals do it, so it must be normal for humans to do it\" is not very compelling at all.\n \n \nDo little kids start off thinking homosexuality is normal? They don't even know what it is!\n\n \n Actually, in my experience, they often seem to understand by default that men and women get together as a couple. The idea that men and men might be a romantic couple comes as a surprise to them, in many cases. Now, one could argue it's simply because they see man-and-woman couples more around them, but who knows? Either way, its been my experience that little kids don't start off thinking of 'homosexuality' (at least in terms that can understand that concept) as natural.\n \n \n There was a thread were the author was complaining about how Spongebob is gay. Kids can't tell the difference! They're taught these prejudices, taught bigotry.\n\n \n I would argue that it's not so much a prejudice issue, but what comes and seems natural for the human race. People don't just disapprove of homosexual behavior because they've been taught it, but because they simply know its beyond the scope of normal human behavior.",

To continue to do so while claming to be \"pro-gay\" is nothing short of deranged.",

Jyoshu or whoever, you can't pretend to be someone friend and attack who they are. It's the oldest trick in the book. You are contributing to the violence against homosexual people and you play a role in destroying children lives. I'm not trying to attack you, but you feed people bait to attack othes. You have contributed to the recent violence against homosexuls in New York City. Many have given up on life because their parents and family members hate them and you contribute to this. Thus they engage in unsafe practices and use drugs because know one cares about them. Jyoshu, how do you feel about this? Violence is terrible but people are also being mentally persecuted. That's what make the homosexual struggle worse than any struggle. We don't have the support of our family and clergy and others had that support.",

   "VANCOUVER -- Criminologist Doug Janoff says violence against homosexuals in Canada is more \"frenzied\" and intense than that perpetrated against other victims of violent crime. \n \n \"The violence is real, it is intense and it really needs to be taken seriously,\" Janoff says. \n \n In his new book, Pink Blood: Homophobic Violence in Canada (University of Toronto Press), Janoff says the gay community has to work to ensure that the law is applied to those crimes in the courts and by police forces. \n \n \"There's no watching the protectors, the police who are supposed to be protecting us from this violence,\" says the Ottawa-based author, who has a master's degree in criminology from B.C.'s Simon Fraser University. \n \n \"We need to start asking very hard questions . . . demanding that these laws that are supposedly in place to protect us are actually going to be utilized.\" \n \n The book opens with a list of 100-plus homosexuals who have died violently in the past decade. Janoff says he fears some people may not be able to get past the details of some of the deaths. \n \n \"They have a really hard time sitting there and reading about the bodies being burnt beyond recognition, or the body being kicked to the point where the victim was no longer recognizable, or the body being mutilated and thrown into a garbage dump,\" he says. \"I need to present that evidence so people can take it seriously.\" \n \n Perhaps the most horrific death was what Janoff calls the \"frenzied killing\" of David Curnick of Vancouver. The 54-year-old teacher was found dead in his apartment in 1994 after being stabbed 146 times with his own kitchen knife. \n \n Janoff likens the situation that homosexuals face in court to that of women who are sexually assaulted. \n \n \"What you see a lot of is almost demonization of homosexuality once it gets to the courtroom,\" he says. \"(It's) not dissimilar to the way women who are sexual assault victims can be victimized in the courtroom with questions about their own morals or sexuality.\" \n \n Violent assaults against homosexuals are often not framed as hate crimes, and \"the whole question of sexuality is lurking beneath the surface,\" Janoff says. \n \n He adds that almost no judges take advantage of legislation allowing for stiffer sentences for hate-motivated crimes. \n \n \"We have this problem of the inability of the system itself to even acknowledge the homophobia that is inherent in many of these crimes,\" Janoff says. \n \n Sociologist Gary Kinsman of Laurentian University, one of Canada's foremost researchers on gay issues, says Janoff's book is unique. \n \n \"There's been a fair amount of research in the States but very little in Canada,\" Kinsman says. \"This . . . (is) the first book-length treatment of this topic in the Canadian context.\" \n \n Kinsman says homophobic violence is \"a widespread, pervasive social problem.\" \n http://www.canada.com/entertainment/books/story.html?id=01c6f063-d352-421f-99c1-aec20e402df6 \n So much for \"rare, isolated.\"",
