They already pay more than the minimum wage, so the rise won't directly affect them.\n \n But if they raise it they can drive smaller competitors who can't afford it (but have other benefits in place which already attract employees such as proximity to home and a relaxed working style) out of business, and thereby increase their market share.",

The only wage that counts is the real wage - the number of goods that any given wage can purchase. With no minimum wage, entry level jobs will pay about one lunch at McDonalds per hour. With a high minimum wage, prices will soon rise so that one hour of entry level labor will still only get you a lunch at McDonalds. It has always been thus. Make a proposal that means something.",
