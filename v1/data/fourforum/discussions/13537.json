   "\n \n By ABBY GOODNOUGH\n Published: November 4, 2009 \n For gay rights advocates, who suffered a crushing loss in Maine on Tuesday, the road forward seems more complicated than ever. \n \n A Setback in Maine for Gay Marriage, but Medical Marijuana Law Expands (November 5, 2009) Proponents of gay marriage had more money, volunteers and political support, and geography was on their side, given that New England has been more accepting of same-sex marriage than any other region of the country. Yet voters decided to repeal the state's new law allowing gays and lesbians to wed, setting back a movement that had made remarkable progress nationally this year. \n \n The loss is likely to further splinter a movement that has been debating the best tactics for success.\n \n In Maine, advocates stuck to a familiar path: Using their own personal stories, they tried to persuade votes that gay people were no different from their straight neighbors and deserved equal treatment under the law.\n \n Now, many will argue that that approach is not enough. Some are already pressing for more aggressive tactics, like speeding up a ballot measure to reverse California's ban on gay marriage next year, instead of taking more time to build support. Others want to focus on swaying federal lawmakers to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, which Representative Barney Frank, the nation's highest-ranking openly gay politician, has called foolish at this point. \n \n \"The state-by-state strategy that looked clever a few years ago has run its course,\" said Richard Socarides, who advised President Bill Clinton on gay issues. \"The states that were easy to get have been gotten.\"\n \n This year, three other states - Iowa, New Hampshire and Vermont - joined Massachusetts and Connecticut in allowing same-sex marriage, but only through court rulings and legislative action. Maine, with its libertarian leanings, had seemed to offer an excellent chance of reversing the long national trend of voters rejecting marriage equality at the ballot box. \n \n Instead, Maine became the 31st state to block same-sex marriage through a public referendum. With 99 percent of precincts reporting on Wednesday, the repeal proposal had 53 percent of the vote, even though polls had indicated the race was a dead heat. \n The tactic of using personal conversations to press for marriage equality will not be abandoned after Tuesday's resounding vote, and several advocates said that, if anything, the defeat called for more such conversations around the country.\n http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/05/us/05marriage.html?_r=1 \n\n \n \n When placed on the ballot instead of being rammed down the public's throats by activist courts and out-of-touch legislators, gay marriage has a ZERO - 31 record. The fact is that the public, when it exercises its Constitutional Right to decide via the ballot box, has decided against gay marriage EVERY TIME.\n \n Gays can't blame the Christian Right and the Mormons for spending $Millions on this one. In fact, gays spent a ton on this one....and it didn't matter.",

   "Another state affirms the obvious that a marriage is between a man and a woman, everything else is not. Period.\n \n Why has an isolated, rural state with a population of just 1.4 million become ground zero in the fight over gay marriage in the US?\n \n Earlier this year, Maine's governor, John Baldacci, reluctantly signed a law allowing same-sex couples to marry. But a group opposing gay marriage, Stand for Marriage Maine, has forced a statewide referendum to overturn it - a \"people's veto\" - which will be held today.\n \n Government restrictions on who can get married have long been part of US history. Maine barred whites from marrying blacks or Native Americans until 1881, and it wasn't until 1967 that the US supreme court ruled such anti-miscegenation statutes unconstitutional. Laws barring sodomy were overturned in 2003. But gay couples still struggle to attain this last legal equaliser. \n \n Currently, four other states allow same-sex couples to marry: Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts and Vermont. New Hampshire will join them next year. What makes Maine unique is that, if the ballot measure is defeated, it will become the first popular referendum in the country approving gay marriage. Initiatives expanding gay rights are also on the ballots in Washington and Michigan.\n \n Stand for Marriage Maine has received strong support, to the tune of nearly $350,000, from well-known opponents of gay marriage, including the Catholic church and National Organisation for Marriage. Opposing them, and the ballot initiative, is a consortium of gay rights advocates called NO on 1.\n \n The fight between the two groups has picked up where the battle over Proposition 8 in California left off last year. There, voters succeeded in overturning the California law allowing gay marriage. And so Stand for Marriage Maine has taken not just a page but the entire playbook used out west. It hired the same public relations firm for its campaign and has even run exact copies of television ads, harping on the same theme that proved successful in California: that allowing gays to marry would lead to \"teaching\" about it schools, preying on fears the public may have.\n \n But NO on 1 is also drawing on the experiences learned in the bitter Prop 8 loss. The campaign has been prepared to refute the claims that allowing gays to marry will affect school curricula (it will not). Its message has been a consistent portrayal of gay families as what they are, and makes one wonder what the fuss is about - they lead the same boring lives as the rest of us.\n \n In Tuesday's election, the people's veto will likely be defeated and the law allowing same-sex marriage will stand. Supporters of gay marriage have raised almost twice as much money as opponents and enjoy strong support in the more urban and liberal southern part of Maine. Most people living here don't care much about the private lives of others and instead value the contributions each of us makes to our communities, our schools and our workplaces.\n \n In a country where 30 states have voted that \"marriage\" is between one man and one woman, a vote in favour of gay marriage would be a first - a turn of the tide that will allow gay rights advocates in other states to take heart. Hopefully the old political adage \"As Maine goes, so goes the nation\" will ring true again.\n \n Putting gay marriage to the test | Gerald Weinand | Comment is free | guardian.co.uk\n \n I wonder why sodomites, homosexuals, whatever call themselves 'gays' when they always seem so angry,",

Especially since our most liberal states DID vote against gay marriage when allowed to choose for or against it. \n \n And as JP made clear, once again as Jake is attempting to claim some imagined minority status, this allows them to assert some justification for special rights when all that separates them from us is their desire to practice what is undeniably an unnatural sexual proclivity. Are pedophiles a legitimate minority deserving of special rights? How about adulterers and fornicators? Surely they too deserve special protections since society frowns upon their practices which destroy families. \n \n So ones sexual habits don't translate to a minority status like race does. But for decades the homosexual agenda has attempted to liken itself to the civil rights movement in order to appear legitimate.

   "No. Drinking and driving hurts people.\n \n\n \n So does homosexuality. Their life expectancy is far shorter than heteros just as their actual numbers are far less than declared. Here is some evidence of that. An excerpt:\n \n Federal Distortion Of Homosexual Footprint (Ignoring Early Gay Death?)Non-reporting, Exaggeration of Homosexual Prevalence. By ignoring the paucity of older homosexuals, Federal bureaucracies in three countries exaggerated the size of the homosexual footprint. In 2003, Statistics Canada reported on a random sample of 121,300 adults, reporting 1.7% were bi/homosexual. Because of a decline in incidence from about 2% of adults aged in their 20s and 30s to a third of one percent among the old, inclusion of respondents aged 60+ yields a revised estimate of 1.4%. In 2005, the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics interviewed a random sample of 11,571 younger adults, but misreported findings to indicate more frequent same-sex sexual experience. In 2005, the British Department of Trade and Industry said &#8220;a wide range of research&#8221; indicated &#8220;lesbian, gay and bisexual people constitute 5- 7% of the total adult population.&#8221; Yet surveys which included adults of all ages put the prevalence closer to 1-2%. Curious mistakes and omissions for well-funded bureaucracies charged with &#8216;reporting the truth.&#8217;\n Link to Early Death. Exclusion of older adults increases the reported size of the homosexual footprint, and also tends to obscure the apparent early death of those engaging in homosexuality. Median ages of death in &#8216;gay marriage&#8217; for 561 gays and 91 lesbians in Denmark (1990&#8211;2002) and 31 gays and 6 lesbians in Norway (1997&#8211;2002) were similar to U.S. gay obituaries during the same period: 52 yr. for 710 gays who ostensibly did not die of AIDS, 42 yr. for those 1,476 who supposedly did; and 55 yr. for 143 lesbians. On average, ever-married men outlived the ever-homosexually-partnered by 23 years in Denmark (74 yr. v. 51 yr.), and 25 years in Norway (77 yr. v. 52 yr.); ever-married women outlived the ever-homosexually-partnered in Denmark by 22 years (78 yr. v. 56 yr.), and in Norway by almost 25 years (81 yr. v. 56 yr.).\n Implications. By not sampling (U.S., Britain) or reporting on (Canada) those aged 60+, the objectivity of central bureaucracies is called into question. That the ~2% of adults who engage in homosexuality have life spans at least 20 years shorter than the general adult population in countries contributing relevant data has implications for social policy: e.g., &#8216;gay rights&#8217; (the decrement in the gay lifespan appears similar in societies that legally protect homosexuals or don&#8217;t, suggesting &#8216;discrimination&#8217; does not cause their earlier death); gay marriage (which unlike man-woman marriage appears not to increase longevity); adoption (children of homosexuals are more frequently orphaned); favorable depiction of the homosexual lifestyle in schools (which is inconsistent with condemning the lesser harm of smoking); special protections for those who engage in homosexuality (why not also protect others whose sexual choices &#8212; such as polygamy or adultery &#8212; cause disruption and extra costs?); and equitable allocation of social resources (why spend excessively on HIV when cancer, heart disease, etc. afflict many more citizens?).\n Eastern Psychological Assn Convention, City Center Sheraton, Philadelphia: 3/23/07\n \n Federal Distortion Of Homosexual Footprint (Ignoring Early Gay Death?)\n Under political pressure rather than the weight of empirical findings,1 the &#8216;soft&#8217; disciplines (e.g., psychiatry, social work) did an about-face on homosexuality. Seventy years ago they attempted to &#8216;treat&#8217; those who engaged in same-sex sex, directing them toward conventional married, child-bearing productivity. Today these disciplines seek the social acceptance of gays and lesbians, even though homosexuals contribute less (e.g., less frequent child-bearing, less economically productive) and cost more (e.g., AIDS, STDs, substance abuse, smoking) than non- homosexuals.2\n Federal or central government agencies are supposed to be different. In theory, aloof from politics and social fads, their sole function is to &#8216;gather and tell facts.&#8217; It is therefore of concern when they depart from their &#8216;fact-telling&#8217; mission to indulge in politics.\n Kinsey&#8217;s 1948 claim3 that &#8220;37% of all men&#8221; had had a homosexual orgasm began a series of extravagant claims by gay activists about the prevalence of homosexuality. Three recent reports suggest national bureaucracies may have joined with activists in exaggerating the size of the homosexual footprint:\n &#8226; Great Britain&#8217;s Department of Trade and Industry4 declared in 2005 that &#8220;lesbian, gay and bisexual people constitute 5-7% of the total adult population.&#8221; This announcement made Britain the first country to officially estimate its homosexual footprint and was most certainly news. But the uncertainties the department expressed about this estimate &#8212; e.g. &#8220;[t]here is very little reliable data about the size of the LGB population;&#8221; &#8220;[w]hilst no specific data is available, a wide range of research suggests&#8221; (p. 13) &#8212; is cause for concern. Why 5-7% when so many surveys have reported significantly smaller fractions of &#8216;homosexuals?&#8217;6,7,15,18 The research the department cited did not involve a new random sampling of all adults from Britain, but instead utilized studies with sampling frames from different countries that excluded anyone above the age of 44 or the age of 59. A sampling frame that stops at age 59 ignores about a quarter of adults. If homosexuals are less frequently represented among the older,8 the best estimate might be significantly lower than what was reported.\n &#8226; In September, 2005, the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics [NCHS] reported5 &#8220;[a]bout 6.5 percent of men 25-44 years of age have had oral or anal sex with another man... 11 percent of women 25-44 years of age reported having had a sexual experience with another woman.&#8221; These statements were inaccurate, since the questions that generated these statistics were about lifetime same-sex sexual activity, not merely sex with adults (e.g., for men &#8220;ever done any of the following with another male&#8221; [6% &#8216;ever&#8217;, but 2.9% in last 12 months; 1.6% reported such behavior &#8216;only&#8217; with men], and for women &#8220;ever had any sexual experience of any kind with another female&#8221; (p. 9) [11.2%; 4.4% in last 12 months; 1.3% &#8216;only&#8217; with female(s)]).\n \n In June 2004, Statistics Canada announced9 that for its random sample of 121,300 adults, &#8220;1.0% of Canadians aged 18 to 59 consider themselves to be homosexual, and 0.7% considered themselves bisexual.&#8221; The 1.7% figure was employed both by Statistics Canada and the press. Yet, with older respondents (aged 60+) included, the figure drops 16% &#8212; from 1.7% to 1.4%.http://www.lifesite.net/ldn/2007_docs/CameronHomosexualFootprint.pdf\n \n And here:\n http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1805593/posts",

   "Archangel: We've been through this a million times. Paul Cameron's research is not reliable. He's been kicked out of many major psychological and sociological organizations and censured by a federal judge for his garbage research methods. He has a track record.\n \n On Cameron's research methods:\n \n \"What do vital-statistics buffs think of this technique? Nick Eberstadt at the American Enterprise Institute sums up the reactions of several of his fellow demographers: \"The method as you describe it is just ridiculous.\" But you don't have to be a trained statistician to spot the fallacy at its heart, which is, to quote Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statistician John Karon, that \"you're only getting the ages of those who die.\" Gay men of the same generation destined to live to old age, even if more numerous, won't turn up in the sample.\n \n Other critics rattle off further objections. The deaths reported in these papers, mostly AIDS deaths, will tend to represent the community defined by such papers or directly known to their editors. It will include relatively more subjects who live in town and are overtly gay and relatively few who blend into the suburbs and seldom set foot in bars. It will overrepresent those whose passing strikes others as newsworthy and underrepresent those who end their days in retired obscurity in some sunny clime.\n \n Bennett is a busy man, but even he has access to the back of an envelope. A moment's thought might have suggested a few simple test calculations. Suppose he assumes--wildly pessimistically, given current incidence data--that half the gay male population is destined to catch the AIDS virus and die of it. The actual average age of AIDS patients at death has been about 40. (Presumably protease inhibitors will extend average longevity, but that will only increase Bennett's difficulty.) For the number 43 to be the true average death age for the entire population of gay males, HIV-negative gay men would, on average, have to keel into their graves at 46. Looked at another way, if even half the gay male population stays HIV-negative and lives to an average age of 75, an average overall life span of 43 implies that gay males with AIDS die at an implausibly early average age (11, actually).\n \n Against this, Cameron and his supporters argue that, according to their survey of obits, even if they don't have AIDS, homosexual males tend to die by their mid-40s (and lesbians by their late 40s). Some downright peculiar results followed from this inference. One is that--contrary to the opinion of virtually everyone else in the world--AIDS in fact hasn't reduced gay males' life expectancy by that much--a few years, at most. Moreover, the obits also recorded lots of violent and accidental deaths. From this Cameron and company concluded not that newsworthy deaths tend to get into newspapers, but that gays must experience shockingly high rates of violent death. With a perfectly straight face they report, for example, that lesbians are at least 300 times more likely to die in car crashes than females of similar ages in general.\"\n \n William Bennett, Gays, and the Truth - By Walter Olson - Slate Magazine",

You want the bennies of marriage, meet the criteria.\n\n It's amusing to watch the anti-gay side try to play the shell-game where they try to RELABEL the discrimination, and pretend that it is somehow automatically allowable if all they do is give it a different name like \"criteria\".\n \n Even more amusing to note that racists in the 1960's (and before) tried the same tactic with miscegenation. If you read Loving v Virginia, you can clearly see where SCOTUS rejected the attempts that are tried time and time again on this forum.\n \n There also, the racists argued that people were \"free to marry a member of their own race\".\n But pointing to how the discrimination allows some legal form of enjoying the right DOES NOT justify the gender restrictions placed upon the right.\n \n \n \nWhat part of the term HYPOTHETICAL isn't passing through your starch-filled cranium?\n\n Puh-leaze.\n Let's not insult your intelligence by you pretending that your comment has no correlation to a variety of gay subject matter...\n \n Cause even though you want to play the part of the emperor insisting \"these are hypothetical\" clothes, it doesn't stop anybody else from recognizing your nudity...\n \n \n \nTax breaks aren't rights. \n\n As long as SPECIFIC tax breaks are associated with marriage, they most certainly are related to rights.\n If you and your anti-gay crew were to remove all tax breaks as legally required benefits for married couples, then those tax breaks would most definitively stop being an issue of 14th amendment requirements...\n \n \n \nIt's only woefully incomplete if your attempting to weasel out of the obvious answer. I could have added all sorts of cavaets but it wasn't necessary. \n\n Oh puh-leaze!\n You avoided adding more caveats cause there is only so far you can stretch the parallel and still have some semblance of matching with the gay community.\n You AVOIDED including caveats which would eliminate the parallel.\n You AVOID ADMITTING the significance of caveats which would make the answer more clear.\n \n \n \nApples to oranges again. Gays aren't a protected class.\n\n 1) I have already documented that according to California courts, they most certainly are...\n \n 2) The phrase \"protected class\" is virtually irrelevant to this issue.\n The 14th amendment applies to gays, PROVIDING EQUALITY PROTECTION.\n That is what is relevant.\n \n 3) Don't cowardly drop out of the object lesson based on that distinction.\n To take your parallel further, would YOU think it relevant \"to reward that group\" by allowing them to be considered as a \"protected class\" if they truly were passing along the disease at such extreme rates???\n \n Such an obvious distinction would (in your desire for prejudice) obviously be a clear denotation towards having the \"group\" in question NOT be considered a \"protected class\", would it not?\n \n \n \nNow, back to my analogy. I never mentioned what that group was, nor what the disease they were spreading was. Neither were part of MY scenario, so stop trying to rewrite my analogy to fit YOUR purpose.\n\n JPSartre12, Puh-leaze!\n We ALL know where you want to go with this.\n It's on the \"gay\" forum section.\n So don't try to play stupid here...\n \n As it is, my answer would have to be a definitive \"too little information to draw a conclusion\". emoticon_xdonno\n \n It's funny to watch some people try to EMBRACE the darker lies of bigots out there, while at the same time trying to pretend they aren't...\n \"Funny\" in that they fool nobody but themselves into believing their tactics are sound...",

It has an anti-gay agenda, and an agenda of propping up liars like Cameron. Birds of a feather.

The heterosexual sample has been accumulating under-forties for an entire century. (In 2005, the average age of the groom was 37.4 years; for the bride, 34.7 years.15) But registered same-sex partnerships have only been available in Denmark since 1989, which means the gay sample got a late start. And if the typical age of someone entering into a same-sex partnership is around forty, then it stands to reason that the typical age at death of someone who has died so far would be similarly young. \n ...............\n In other words, Cameron&#8217;s sample only captured those who died so far, out of a sample that continues to live and grow older without dying.\"\n \n Paul Cameron's Footprint\n \n We've already discussed the problems with the U.S. sample.",

And according to Jefferson, it would be punishable.\n \n Considering the majority of today's American populace, gay marriage is not to be approved.\n \n And, considering the Word of God, gay sex continues to be a sin, a perversion, and an abomination. \n \n Repent.\n\n \n You know I rather grow tired of your childish emotes such as \"flush\" or \"yawn\" Easy. You do not see other posters doing such to your outrageous remarks...\n \n Regarding your off the wall commenting yet again, The majority of Americans actually side FOR gay marriage. The margin is very very slim Easy. And also considering the word of god, it has many interpretations, not everyone believes it, and American laws regarding basic human rights should NOT be dictated by it or any other belief. Period.\n \n And furthermore, some would argue that the word of god speaks FOR gays and lesbian, not against. Your fundamentalist literalism holds little sway especially when it is cold and calculated attacks upon the hearts and lives of thousands seeking to love those whom they cherish.",

At the same time he was stupid enough to promote the lowering of the age of consent to 14. So we have a popular gay activist suggesting that young boys should start to learn the joys of sodomy ay 14 years old . \n \n \n \nOh my goodness. You're obsessed over one type of sex, especially if a male is in the \"submissive\" position. You also see females as weak, submissive and perpetual victims. What if your daughter had \"buggered\" a boy? This seems to be an issue of your own hangups.\n \n Where did Thatchell specifically say he wanted boys, girls, or anyone else to be \"buggered\" or anyone specifically to do the \"buggering\"? ...\n\n \n My daughter buggering a boy..are you really that stupid?\n You really dont know much about girls do you?\n I never suggested girls are weak, submissive victims, where did that pop up in your head?\n What do you think that the age of consent means?\n Tatchell knows full well what buggering means even if you dontemoticon_xclown\n \n \n \nIf you change the age of consent a young person could have consentual sex with an older person. This change can't happen without the support of the Parliament, the majority of which are heterosexual. I'd hardly call those advancing this in parliament part of a heterosexual agenda. Nor other heterosexuals who support it. I've also shown you that gay marriage can be a reality without later lowering the age of consent, but in fact raising it, as in the Canadian example. Britain doesn't even have same-sex marriage.\n\n \n \n Gay marriage is just another step in the promotion of gay sex by gays..you admitted it.\n What started as showing compassion and tolerance to men who indulged in homosexual sex has turned into a veracious gay pressure group intent on normalising the far from normal.",

What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union.

The deeper question I see is whether or not slavery was at the foundation of his concern for the survival of the Union. It was after all the issue which was motivating the south to threaten secession after all. \n \n I mean, if Lincoln saw no problem with slavery existing, and he didn't see it as threatening the future survival of the country, then surely he wouldn't have plunged us into war over it. Your quote is very enlightening though and I never realized he personally had such a laze faire attitude about the plight of slaves in this country. Remember my friend, Lincoln also made these statements:\n \n  \"I am naturally anti-slavery. If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong. I \n can not remember when I did not so think, and feel. And yet I have never \n understood that the Presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to \n act officially upon this judgment and feeling.\"\n Abraham Lincoln\n Source: April 4, 1864 - Letter to Albert Hodges\n \n \"If as the friends of colonization hope, the present and coming generations \n of our countrymen shall by any means, succeed in freeing our land from the \n dangerous presence of slavery; and, at the same time, in restoring a captive \n people to their long-lost father-land, with bright prospects for the future; \n and this too, so gradually, that neither races nor individuals shall have \n suffered by the change, it will indeed be a glorious consummation.\"\n Abraham Lincoln\n Source: July 6, 1852 - Eulogy on Henry Clay\n \n \"The Autocrat of all the Russias will resign his crown, and proclaim his \n subjects free republicans sooner than will our American masters voluntarily \n give up their slaves.\"\n Abraham Lincoln\n Source: August 15, 1855 - Letter to George Robertson \n \n \"You know I dislike slavery; and you fully admit the abstract wrong of it.\"\n Abraham Lincoln\n Source: August 24, 1855 - Letter to Joshua Speed\n \n \"The slave-breeders and slave-traders, are a small, odious and detested \n class, among you; and yet in politics, they dictate the course of all of you, \n and are as completely your masters, as you are the master of your \n own negroes.\"\n Abraham Lincoln\n Source: August 24, 1855 - Letter to Joshua Speed \n \n \"I believe this Government cannot endure, permanently half slave \n and half free.\"\n Abraham Lincoln\n Source: June 16, 1858 - House Divided Speech in Springfield, Illinois\n \n \"A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government \n cannot endure permanently half-slave and half-free.

   "AM I peeping into your bedroom window? Am I chasing after heterosexual men or preying upon others? No. So don't call me a pervert just because all you can think of when it comes to gay people is sex.\n \n And I never said accept the love me and my partner share. I could care less if you accepted anything! You think I am trying to change your mindset? Certainly not. Only from oneself can the heart be changed in all matters..\n \n Yes but you certainly said make homosexuality illegal which was exactly done in the days of Hitler and Franco resulting in the deaths of thousands upon thousands of gay people!\n \n And once again there with the sex.. You know I just have to wonder why are you so obsessed with what I do behind closed doors? Why do you make it a point to fling that little tidbit out at every turn? Have I ever said what I have done in the bedroom? No!\n \n Have I ever implied having others accept what I do privately? Of course not.. But then again this is only one element. And all you rant about is the sex part. Have you not read my previous posts saying that my partner and I have not engaged in sexual intercourse? Due to our own personal reasons for each other and that we value our relationship on a deeper level than that?\n \n I guess you skipped over that part.. Seriously I think you and Easy both need some form of counseling on your obsession of sex. And not just sex but same gender sex.. \n \n In all my time on these boards you two are the most who have at every turn of every post made some reference to intercourse... I wonder if there is not a deeper underlying reason for this...\n\n \n When the gays paint themselves into a corner they always come out with the old chestnut that I you criticise gay sex you must be gay...yawn.\n \n I have stated that I believe gays should be allowed to do whatever they want to each other but should not be allowed to 'marry' or encourage anyone else to engage in their own perverted life style.",

   "So speaking as a Mormon, Gay marriage isn't what bothers me. In fact, we believe in a separation of church and state, and being subject to the law. The \"Articles of Faith\" are 13 major points of our religious beliefs. This is number 12 \"We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law.\" \n \n According to the Constitution, I don't see how we can deny gays the right to marry. It doesn't seem Constitutional to refuse. Having said this, very many people are saying, \"Why are you against gay marriage, then? It's not like it hurts YOU at all if some gay people get married!\" Oh, but it does. The reason that we \"Mormons\" opposed gay marriage so vocally is that giving gays the right to marry is that it endangers the traditional family. \n \n It means that the government recognizes gays as a family, and must protect them legally. Why is that a problem? Here's an example: A Mormon family in New Hampshire, where gay marriages are legal, almost got their kids taken away. Their kids were assigned to read in school a book about how gay marriage isn't wrong. According to our religion, gay marriage is wrong. The kids read it, and then when the teacher asked opinions on the book, the kid said, \"I don't believe it's right.\" When they found that the parents taught their kids as many of us do, \"We don't believe it's right, but they are free to choose as they like,\" (we also say this about smoking, pre-marital sex and many other things,) they had social services investigate the family for teaching them such insidious things. IT'S MY RELIGION. I believe gays should have the freedom to marry, as long as it doesn't inhibit my FREEDOM OF RELIGION.\n \n Here's another example: religious adoption agencies loose state licensing. Right now, both our church and the Catholic Church have adoption agencies for Mormons/Catholics respectively who want their child to be raised in their religion. Neither considers gay couples, because both churches believe homosexuality to be a sin. (i.e., they will not be members of that church.) With the recognition of gay marriage, they would be forced to change that policy or close. (happened twice to Catholic institutions in New England.) Also, there's the point about our clergy being forced to perform marriages that they believe are wrong, in our churches. That's as good as asking an animal rights activist to stomp a puppy to death. Also, because of policies regarding gays, several churches have lost tax exempt status, costing them millions every year.\n \n I come from Atlanta. It's a big gay city. I have many very close and dear friends who are gay, including one of my three best friends from growing up. I have my beliefs, but I also believe that we are all children of God, and are all sinners, so we are in no position to judge. I treat all the gays I know just like anybody else. They do not deserve to be hated, ostracized, discriminated against, or PROHIBITED TO MARRY! However, I can't see a way of allowing gay marriage without giving up a large part of my religious freedom and my right to raise my children as I believe is right. I am for gay marriage, but can't see a way for it to happen until safeguards are put in place protecting traditional families and any religions that feel that gender is an eternal and spiritual thing.",

Two people committing themselves in a monogamous private relationship does not harm your kids... \n \n What you envision as a traditional family is just another extension of what family may or may not be. You have single mothers, single father, various homes that are different where kids are raised just fine...\n \n Many gay couples raise children in a loving caring home, and frankly your view of traditional is just sadly another fabricated image painted to you...\n \n \n \n \n \n \nIt means that the government recognizes gays as a family, and must protect them legally. Why is that a problem? Here's an example: A Mormon family in New Hampshire, where gay marriages are legal, almost got their kids taken away. Their kids were assigned to read in school a book about how gay marriage isn't wrong. According to our religion, gay marriage is wrong. The kids read it, and then when the teacher asked opinions on the book, the kid said, \"I don't believe it's right.\" When they found that the parents taught their kids as many of us do, \"We don't believe it's right, but they are free to choose as they like,\" (we also say this about smoking, pre-marital sex and many other things,) they had social services investigate the family for teaching them such insidious things. IT'S MY RELIGION. I believe gays should have the freedom to marry, as long as it doesn't inhibit my FREEDOM OF RELIGION.\n\n \n That's an issue with social services not gay marriage.... Your blaming gays getting married for something taught by the state.... Personally I don't think such books are necessary, and I think it's fabricated....\n \n A child being taken away because they have a difference of opinion? I highly doubt that... And even if it is true, Once again it is a matter of the state, not the gay couples wanting to get married.\n \n I don't want their kids taken away, and I feel parenting and teaching should be left up to the family. And if you so worried about what your kids learn, perhaps you should learn to teach them better as parents, not force the state to teach only to your views....\n \n \n \nHere's another example: religious adoption agencies loose state licensing. Right now, both our church and the Catholic Church have adoption agencies for Mormons/Catholics respectively who want their child to be raised in their religion. Neither considers gay couples, because both churches believe homosexuality to be a sin. (i.e., they will not be members of that church.) With the recognition of gay marriage, they would be forced to change that policy or close. (happened twice to Catholic institutions in New England.) Also, there's the point about our clergy being forced to perform marriages that they believe are wrong, in our churches. That's as good as asking an animal rights activist to stomp a puppy to death. Also, because of policies regarding gays, several churches have lost tax exempt status, costing them millions every year.\n\n \n Oh please.... Equating a puppy being stomped because churches can't discriminate against others..... What a sad excuse.... In my opinion these couples shouldn't even bother with your church I'd tell them to go somewhere else....\n \n And if they lost their tax exempt status so be it.... I don;t know the statute on New England's tax status but once again, a matter of the state....\n \n \nI come from Atlanta. It's a big gay city. I have many very close and dear friends who are gay, including one of my three best friends from growing up. I have my beliefs, but I also believe that we are all children of God, and are all sinners, so we are in no position to judge. I treat all the gays I know just like anybody else. They do not deserve to be hated, ostracized, discriminated against, or PROHIBITED TO MARRY! However, I can't see a way of allowing gay marriage without giving up a large part of my religious freedom and my right to raise my children as I believe is right. I am for gay marriage, but can't see a way for it to happen until safeguards are put in place protecting traditional families and any religions that feel that gender is an eternal and spiritual thing.\n\n \n Protect what? Marriage should be a matter of the state not the church in my opinion. If we did away with the church's involvement we wouldn't even be in this position to begin with...\n \n \n I just think that this whole notion of \"protect\" traditional families is just more pork to feed people who are ignorant and fearful of gays, or even have prejudiced views toward it....",

   "JazyJason, MrWriteLA, did either of you even read my post at all? Please at least read all of this one. I'm sorry, I know it's really long.\n \n MrWriteLA:\n \nShould a Muslim family protest if their kid's public school has pictures in their textbooks featuring women without their faces covered? A Jewish family protest because the books say eating pork is okay?\n If you'll read what I wrote, I have no problem with kids meeting gay people, or reading books that tell them not to discriminate against gays. No problem there. That's called \"reality in the world around us,\" I couldn't agree more. Try to listen less to what you expect me to say, and listen more to what I actually say. What I object to is that when questioned, the kid held by a religious belief, WHICH IS PROTECTED BY THE SECOND AMENDMENT. Voicing that belief in a non-violent way got his family investigated by social services. It's called freedom OF religion, not just freedom AGAINST religion. I have no right to force my views on others, and that's fine. But shouldn't they not be allowed to force their views on my children? I teach them that I believe we are all given free will, and some people disagree with what we believe, but that's their choice, not ours. I teach them to love all people, and to understand that each must live in what way they feel is right. I teach them to accept people as they are. Shame on me. \n \n \nWe don't pass laws telling women to cover their faces or prohibiting the sale of bacon simply to preserve the traditions of particular religious groups,\n To use your metaphor, I'm not asking that the sale of bacon be prohibited. I'm just asking that my child not be forced to eat it. the existence of gays and gay couples is not offensive to me. My child being told that it is a fundamentally correct choice when I respectfully believe otherwise is offensive to me. It's just as wrong for you to force your ideas on me and my child as it would be for me to try to force mine on you. I'm not trying to abolish gays. I'm even trying to find a way for gay marriage to work out to everybody's satisfaction. \n \n JazyJason:\n \nThat's an issue with social services not gay marriage.... Your blaming gays getting married for something taught by the state.... Personally I don't think such books are necessary,\n I'm not blaming gays for it, I am TOTALLY blaming legal. I couldn't agree with you more, it's not the gay's fault. BUT! It is still a problem that results when Gay marriage is legalized. When something like legal gay marriage is introduced, if there are anti-gays who are violent about it, it causes issues (once again, NOT the gays' fault). To try to prevent such issues in future, the state teaches children about all different types. \"Diversity Week,\" or something like that, and they teach about different types of families. Here is the \"traditional family,\" (legal term, not my term,) with a mother, father, children. Here is a single-parent family. Here is a gay family. Once again, I have no problems so far. But when they try to force a child to their views that contradict religious ones, the second amendment is violated, not to mention the first amendment. Imagine if you will, somebody trying to force your child to stand up and condemn gay marriage as a wrong and sinful practice. (not terms I use when teaching my kids to respect their gay peers,) It's terrible, isn't it? It's the exact same for me when a teacher threatens to call social services when my kid won't say that his personal view is complete and total acceptance. \n \n You don't believe that it's really become school curriculum? Check for yourself: Gay Curriculum Proposal Riles Elementary School Parents - Local News | News Articles | National News | US News - FOXNews.com \n Don't believe that it's widespread? Google \"Gay curriculum\" and check out stories of cases in Massachusetts, California, and New Hampshire. I think there were more, but that was the first page I got. Once again, I have NO PROBLEM with my kids being required to read them. I just have a problem with them being forced to agree. They are allowed to hold their own beliefs about the theory of relativity, but not sexual preference. \n \n \nAnd if they lost their tax exempt status so be it.\n Okay, even I'm not that close-minded. I'm not saying, \"If they can't legally get married, so be it.\" What is the difference, really? None that I can see, except that you like yours. (That seems to me to be the definition of a double-standard) If expect others to care about YOUR issues, you should really try to care about theirs. Equality is a two-way street. If the majority overruns minority, it's terrible, and you get discrimination. If the minority overruns the majority, it's the same, except that there is usually a lot more violence. Not saying it's right. That's just how it is. Martin Luther King didn't have your attitude. His way was \"United we stand.\" Unite with us, don't try to push under to get what you want. Equal is equal, friend. \n \nOh please.... Equating a puppy being stomped because churches can't discriminate against others\n Disliking the metaphor doesn't answer the question, but you are right that it was extreme. How's this for a better one: It's like forcing a Jew to slaughter the animal and cook up the bacon. It's forcing somebody to change their religious beliefs because of a law. What's next, a law saying that my religion can't preach against alcohol or chastity before marriage? LAW SHOULD NOT DICTATE RELIGION. Religion is about God, not the Senate, or the Supreme court, and the first and second amendments support that. If separation of church and state actually exists, then state shouldn't rule church just like church shouldn't rule over state.\n \nTraditional.... Let me explain something to you. Gay marriage in NO WAY endangers your children in any way.... Two people committing themselves in a monogamous private relationship does not harm your kids... \n The rest of my post went on to explain how it endangers my family. Having my kids being taken away is a danger. Not gays' fault, but it can happen anyway. You don't believe it. Google it. I'll see if I can find the report I was looking at yesterday, and post it before the end of the week.\n \n It seems to me that you hate us. I know that there are many many many very judgmental believers out there that hate gays on principle. There are also anti-gay nutjobs who are all for violence. You are understandably defensive. You probably figure that I'm one of them, but I'm not. I'm a true Christian, trying not to be one of them. Ghandi once said, \"I like your Christ, but I do not like your Christians. They are so unlike Christ.\" I think that for the most part, he's right. Christ taught love and acceptance of all people as incredibly valuable children of God, all equal in His sight. So many Christians seem to think that that applies to everybody except gays. They are wrong. Very wrong. \n \n HOWEVER, those nutjobs still exist, and as long as they do, the hyper-defensive, don't-care-what-happens-to-you attitude is getting you no closer to winning them over. Why do you think that every time gay marriage is put to public vote, the majority votes against? It's because those nutjobs stand in the way. Until you try to understand them, they will make no effort to understand you. They aren't going away. They are going to stand in the way every time until you prove to them that you care just as much about their problems as you want them to care about yours.\n \n SUMMARY: I am not blaming gays. I'm saying we have some legal issues to clear up, but I think that gays are in the right. The gays are not the problem. The state is the problem; but until we clear up the problem, we will have big-time unrest. That is what I tried to say with the first post. Also, try to recognize an ally when you see one. I am not trying to stop gay marriage. I'm trying to clear the path so that nobody will be able to hold it back. Right now the legal system has too many potholes.\n \n I'm tired and I hope that this post doesn't come off harsher than I mean it to sound. I'm just trying to be painfully clear. I wasn't clear enough in the last post, and I think that it upset people. I'm trying to be clearer this time. I mean no offense. I look forward to the day when we are all united on this issue. I really want to work to make that happen.",

   "And if they lost their tax exempt status so be it.\n It occured to me that you might not know why this is a problem, which would mean that I totally misunderstood this comment.\n \n Loosing tax exempt status means that they are taxed as a business. If you hadn't noticed, business taxes are going up in leaps and bounds. In many churches this would be a problem. In my church, it would be a HUGE problem. We don't have paid clergy. Nobody makes money on our church. The money collected goes to building churches and maintaining them, but also to the many humanitarian efforts worldwide that we have. We buy wheelchairs, make \"disaster packets\" with food, clothing and hygiene kits for people in disasters like the Indonesia tsunami, or the Hati earthquake. We send food all over the country and all over the world to the needy. Millions of Mormons donate hours for free in church-owned canneries to do that. Those canneries were bought and are supplied by the money we have as a tax-exempt church. All those programs are run because we are a tax-exempt church. That's why I think it's a problem.",

And if someday there's enough of us to make America into a Christian nation via a Constitutional Amendment, we can do that too (though no one I know is really thinking seriously about doing that).\n \n \n \n We certainly aren't a secular nation. And unless we want to lose America we need to keep God as our Lord and Protector. Otherwise we'll go down the tubes like so many godless nations before us.\n\n \n And homosexuality being a sin has no bearing on the laws of this country.\n \n See above.\n \n We certainly dont nor should we base any laws on religion. Separation of church and state after all. And no matter how many people want this country to be a Christian country doesnt matter. The constitution forbids it.\n \n We most certainly are a secular nation. Nor does our country need god. Please show why you believe America is a non secular nation.\n \n 1st Amendment - Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.",

   "Yup. Sorry if I didnt make that clear.\n\n \n No problem.\n \n \nOnly if someone is hurt by the marriage somehow or one of the parties is not giving consent.\n\n \n Yet, government does not recognize marriages between close relatives, even though adult relatives are perfectly capable of giving consent. The argument, as you stated, is problems with children. However, a marriage does not mean there will be children nor does denying government recognition stop them from having children. The government also doesn't recognize polygamist marriages. Point being, government can choose which marriages to recognize, subject to the will of the people.\n \n \nSimple. Gay people cannot marry someone who they want to spend the rest of their life with like straight people can. Most of the benefits that are offered in marriage only benefit couples. Like being able to make decisions for their spouse if they are in a coma or other something similar to that.\n\n \n Polygamists and siblings are in the same boat with regards to marriage, because the marriage rules apply to each \"individual\" equally. Nobody can have a government recognized marriage with whomever they want, the marriage has to comply with the rules, same rules for everybody. What your looking for is civil rights for couples, but it doesn't work that way, each individual has civil rights. As for making decisions, no marriage is required. In most cases a living will or other such documents do just as well.\n \n \nMarriage is one of the \"basic civil rights of man,\" fundamental to our very existence and survival.... To deny this fundamental freedom on so unsupportable a basis as the racial classifications embodied in these statutes, classifications so directly subversive of the principle of equality at the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment, is surely to deprive all the State's citizens of liberty without due process of law. The Fourteenth Amendment requires that the freedom of choice to marry not be restricted by invidious racial discrimination. Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State.\n\n \n Loving v. Virginia was written at a time when a marriage between people of the same sex wasn't even a consideration, it wasn't even thought of as a possibility. LvV was written within the strict bounds of racial discrimination and cannot be used as an argument for same sex marriage because the judges issuing the ruling were not taking that into account. Below is part of a ruling by the New York Court of Appeals illustrating this point:\n \n \nBut the traditional definition of marriage is not merely a by-product of historical injustice. Its history is of a different kind. The idea that same-sex marriage is even possible is a relatively new one. Until a few decades ago, it was an accepted truth for almost everyone who ever lived, in any society in which marriage existed, that there could be marriages only between participants of different sex. A court should not lightly conclude that everyone who held this belief was irrational, ignorant or bigoted. We do not so conclude.\n",

   "Gay marriage is not a right under the Constitution. Nor is pedophilia or polygamy. I'm sure they think they have their rights too.\n \n \n \n See above.\n \n \n \n People vote against gay marriage in election after election, and so far no one has said they can't do that. So you're contention that gay marriage is a right doesn't fly with the majority of Americans, or the Constitution.\n \n Here's what God says about gay sex:\n \n Leviticus 18:22 - \"Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable.\" \n \n Leviticus 20:13 - \"If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.\"\n \n Romans 1:26-27 - \"Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.\"\n \n 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 - \"Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.\"\n \n 1 Timothy 1:8-10 - \"But we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully, knowing this: that the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine...\"\n \n Jude 7 - \"In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.\" \n \n There's no gay marriages in the Old Testament; No gay marriages in the New Testament; no gay sex approved anywhere in the Bible. Just the opposite - gay sex is condemned in both testaments. God is consistent on that.\n \n And to close:\n \n \"Whosoever shall be guilty of Rape, Polygamy, or Sodomy with man or woman shall be punished, if a man, by castration, if a woman, by cutting thro' the cartilage of her nose a hole of one half inch diameter at the least.\" - Thomas Jefferson, Amendment VIII: A Bill for Proportioning Crimes and Punishments\n\n \n Do you love Jesus Easy?",

   "Enlighten me JJ.Explain further...\n\n \n Essentially there are certain rights that a full marriage has that a civil partnership does not. Here is a quote outlining the basic differences.\n \n Difference Between Civil Union and Marriage - Civil Unions vs. Gay Marriage\n \n \n The Difference between Gay Marriage and Civil Unions\n \n by Kathy Belge\n \n You hear the politicians saying it all the time. \"I support Civil Unions, but not gay marriage.\" What exactly does this mean? Some even say they support equal rights for gays and lesbians, but not gay marriage. Is this possible? And why do gays and lesbians want marriage so badly when they can have civil unions?\n \n First of all, What is Marriage? When people marry, they tend to do so for reasons of loveand commitment. But marriage is also a legal status, which comes with rights and responsibilities. Marriage establishes a legal kinship between you and your spouse. It is a relationship that is recognized across cultures, countries and religions.\n \n What is a Civil Union? Civil Unions and Domestic Partnerships exist in only a handful of places like New Jersey and Washington and Oregon.\n \n Vermont was the first state to create civil unions in 2000 to provide legal protections to gays and lesbians in relationships in that state because gay marriage is not an option. The protections do not extend beyond the border of Vermont and no federal protections are included with a Civil Union. Civil Unions offer some of the same rights and responsibilities as marriage, but only on a state level.\n \n What about Domestic partnership? Some states and municipalities have domestic partnership registries, but no domestic partnership law is the same. Some, like Oregon's domestic partnership law comes with many rights and responsibilities. Others offer very few benefits to the couple.\n What are some of the differences between Civil Unions and Gay Marriage?\n \n Recognition in other states: Even though each state has its own laws around marriage, if someone is married in one state and moves to another, their marriage is legally recognized. For example, Oregon marriage law applies to people 17 and over. In Washington state, the couple must be 18 to wed. However, Washington will recognize the marriage of two 17 year olds from Oregon who move there. This is not the case with Civil Unions and Domestic Partnerships. If someone has a Domestic Partnership, that union is not recognized by some states and not others. Some states have even ruled that they do not have to recognize civil unions performed in other states, because their states have no such legal category. As gay marriages become legal in other states, this status may change.\n \n Immigration:\n \n A United States citizen who is married can sponsor his or her non-American spouse for immigration into this country. Those with Civil Unions have no such privilege.\n \n Taxes:\n \n Civil Unions are not recognized by the federal government, so couples would not be able to file joint-tax returns or be eligible for tax breaks or protections the government affords to married couples.\n \n Benefits:\n \n The General Accounting Office in 1997 released a list of 1,049 benefits and protections available to heterosexual married couples. These benefits range from federal benefits, such as survivor benefits through Social Security, sick leave to care for ailing partner, tax breaks, veterans benefits and insurance breaks. They also include things like family discounts, obtaining family insurance through your employer, visiting your spouse in the hospital and making medical decisions if your partner is unable to. Civil Unions protect some of these rights, but not all of them.\n \n But can't a lawyer set all this up for gay and lesbian couples?\n \n No. A lawyer can set up some things like durable power of attorney, wills and medical power of attorney. There are several problems with this, however.\n \n 1. It costs thousands of dollars in legal fees. A simple marriage license, which usually costs under $100 would cover all the same rights and benefits.\n \n 2. Any of these can be challenged in court. As a matter of fact, more wills are challenged than not. In the case of wills, legal spouses always have more legal power than any other family member.\n \n 3. Marriage laws are universal. If someone's husband or wife is injured in an accident, all you need to do is show up and say you're his or her spouse. You will not be questioned. If you show up at the hospital with your legal paperwork, the employees may not know what to do with you. If you simply say, \"He's my husband,\" you will immediately be taken to your spouse's side. \n \n Defense of Marriage Law\n \n Even with lesbian and gay marriages being performed and recognized in some states, the Federal Defense of Marriage Law prohibits the federal government from recognizing gay and lesbian relationships. This puts gay and lesbian couples who are married in a legal limbo. How do they file their tax returns? Do they have to pay the tax on their partner's health insurance? How do they fill out legal and other forms, single or married?\n \n Creating Civil Unions creates a separate and unequal status for some of America's citizens. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial court ruled that creating a separate class for gay and lesbian citizens is not permissible and that is why they have voted that only marriage equals marriage. The precedent was set with Brown v. The Board of Education regarding segregation in public education. Ironically, Massachusetts marriage law went into effect on the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education.\n \n The United States Constitution guarantees equality for all. As you can see, marriage and civil unions are not the same. Creating equal access to marriage is the only fair way to ensure equality for gay and straight couples alike.",

   "They are not just labels. Marriage is an institution. Hell even the anti-gay marriage people agree with that. But can you give me an example of acceptable different labels?\n\n \n Well, the examples I've already given are \"black\" and \"white\" as labels for races. \"Gay\" and \"straight\" are labels. Legally speaking, the word \"marriage\" refers to a pooling of assets. Tbh, I'm not sure what is meant by calling it an \"institution\".\n \n \nThere was gay marriage in ancient Rome and Greece. There was also forms of gay marriage in Africa and Native America. However the Supreme Court did not say that marriage is fundamental to our existence and survival as a species. They said it was fundamental to our existence and survival as a nation. In fact marriage didnt exist when man first walked the earth and is bad for our survival in that instance. And this has nothing to do with political correctness and everything to do with equality under the law.\n \n See above for the existence and survival thing.\n\n \n As we've established, equality already exists. The fact that no one can wear goth shirts is equal treatment, even if it impacts those who want to wear goth shirts more than those who don't. If you would, what did the court mean by the \"survival of the nation\"?\n \n Ancient Rome and Greek treatment of homosexuality does not really help your case. The Lex Scantinia is the first instance of recorded Roman law that regulated sexual behavior which including pederasty, adultery and passivity and potentially legislating the death penalty for homosexual behavior among free-borns (slaves could be used for any sexual activity, it seems, and frequently were used for homosexual sex). Even the Roman philosopher Gaius Musonius Rufu, who expressed progressive views on women becoming philosophers, described homosexuality as \"against nature\" even though he seemed to consider adultery as the most illicit of sexual activity.\n \n Of course, the Roman idea of masculinity was associated with penetrative sex. A free-born who was penetrated had been \"feminized\". In Craig Williams' book \"Roman Homosexuality\", he describes a court case of a Roman soldier from an author of the era: \n \n This soldier had been propositioned by his tribune, a relative of the commander Marius, during the war against the Cimbri in 104 B.C.; not only did he reject the tribune's advances, but he killed him in outrage, and despite the fact that the dead man was his relative, Marius ruled that it was a case of justifiable homicide. Defending the soldier's action, the speaker in Calpurnius' declamation first poses a rhetorical question to the slain tribune: \"Is he not yet a man to you, though he is already one of Marius' soldiers?\". That is, the speaker is arguing that, in trying to violate the soldier's sexual integrity, the tribune had disregarded his manhood.\n \n Among the free-born, being penetrated was disgraceful in a man. Homosexual relationships, then, could not enjoy equality with heterosexual relationships.\n \n \n\n Investing in their offspring does not mean monogamy. It just means taking care of the kid they had. They can still sleep with other women and have kids with them and then invest in their offspring with the other woman as well. Basically its a cost benefit analysis. Females are more likely to be monogamous while males arnt. And in todays society monogamy is kind of going away.\n\n \n It is a cost-benefit analysis. A male only has so much investment he can spread around. While both sexes have a genetic incentive to commit adultery, they also have a strong genetic incentive to ensure their partner is monogamous. A male would not wish to waste investment on another man's child and a woman would not want her mate to invest in another woman's child. Thus, monogamy would be selected for over evolutionary time while adultery would be an opportunistic strategy in a similar way rape is an opportunistic strategy.\n \n A woman who has a mate that has indescriminate sexual appetites gains less investment in her children and thus her and that male's reproductive fitness is reduced. A woman who is in a life-long monogamous relationship maximizes the survival of her own offspring and the offspring of that male. The ideal situation for the male is to commit adultery in secret and have another male raise his mistress's children while he raises his wife's. The ideal situation for a woman is to have a male that will invest in her children and no one else's even if the children are not his. The ideal situation for the couple is to be in a life-long monogamous relationship where their genetic interests are tied up in their common children.\n \n \n\n Homosexuals do raise children however and we dont live in the stone age anymore. Marriage has always changed and so have we. Marriage is a legal contract between two people to provide benefits to the couple that are relevant to monogamous couples. Nothing more. That is all marriage is legally. And homosexual couples can benefit from those benefits just like straight couples can.\n\n \n Marriage means more than that to most people, I daresay, though I agree that is all it is legally. \n \n Any two people can stand to gain from marriage benefits. Heck, when you strip any meaning from \"marriage\", why are there any restrictions at all? Why are there age limits? Why are there species limits? Why is it limited to couples only?\n \n The reason there are limits is that marriage is meaningful to us. When you change that meaning you will meet resistance. \n \n \n\n So yes homosexual attractions have the same amount of significance as heterosexual attractions and homosexual relationships should be legally equal to heterosexual relationships if we want to live in a country were all are equal under the law.\n\n \n Heterosexual attraction is the basis of reproduction. That is significant. Homosexual attraction is not the basis of reproduction. It cannot have the same significance.",

Homosexual relationships, then, could not enjoy equality with heterosexual relationships.\n \n \n \n It is a cost-benefit analysis. A male only has so much investment he can spread around. While both sexes have a genetic incentive to commit adultery, they also have a strong genetic incentive to ensure their partner is monogamous. A male would not wish to waste investment on another man's child and a woman would not want her mate to invest in another woman's child. Thus, monogamy would be selected for over evolutionary time while adultery would be an opportunistic strategy in a similar way rape is an opportunistic strategy.\n \n A woman who has a mate that has indescriminate sexual appetites gains less investment in her children and thus her and that male's reproductive fitness is reduced. A woman who is in a life-long monogamous relationship maximizes the survival of her own offspring and the offspring of that male. The ideal situation for the male is to commit adultery in secret and have another male raise his mistress's children while he raises his wife's. The ideal situation for a woman is to have a male that will invest in her children and no one else's even if the children are not his. The ideal situation for the couple is to be in a life-long monogamous relationship where their genetic interests are tied up in their common children.\n \n \n \n Marriage means more than that to most people, I daresay, though I agree that is all it is legally. \n \n Any two people can stand to gain from marriage benefits. Heck, when you strip any meaning from \"marriage\", why are there any restrictions at all? Why are there age limits? Why are there species limits? Why is it limited to couples only?\n \n The reason there are limits is that marriage is meaningful to us. When you change that meaning you will meet resistance. \n \n \n \n Heterosexual attraction is the basis of reproduction. That is significant. Homosexual attraction is not the basis of reproduction. It cannot have the same significance.\n\n \n Black and white or gay and straight are indeed labels. However they are not institutions.

Separate is not equal. But the point I was making with the gothic clothing example is that even if give people the exact same laws they arnt exactly equal. Dont you think it would be wrong to ban a style of clothing?\n \n Well kind of. Here is what that law really did.\n \n The earliest Roman law regarding homosexuality appears to have been the Lex Scantinia that was passed by the Roman assembly at some point in the Roman Republic (perhaps in the second century BC). Although the text of this law itself has not survived, later Roman jurists of the second and third century AD describe how it outlawed the homosexual rape of young male Roman citizens. Consensual male or female homosexual unions apparently were not legislated against. Although there is scholarly debate, Roman literature of the republic and early empire suggests that men who engaged in consensual liaisons were often mocked as unmanly, but consensual homosexual sex itself was not illegal.\n Why the Romans Are Important in the Debate About Gay Marriage\n \n I wont argue that homosexuality wasnt looked down on in Rome because it certainly was. But there was gay marriage in Rome.\n \n What exactly do you mean by investment?\n \n I agree marriage means more to people. But legally that is all it is. \n \n Those benefits dont always apply to those who arnt in a romantic relationship.

Thats why we want to get married. Changing the current state of marriage to allow same sex marriage will not effect straight marriages at all.

I find nothing wrong with that. On a national level it still would not be wrong, though this is a value judgement and would vary person to person. Clothing just isn't very important to me. However, it would be unconstitutional and therefore I would not accept such a restriction even if I did not care what the restriction was.\n \n \n\n Well kind of.

But there was gay marriage in Rome.\n\n \n There was only heterosexual marriage. Homosexual liasons were allowed with slaves because slaves were considered acceptable sexual objects (no matter the gender), but any free-born Roman besides his wife was off-limits. To further complicate matters, freed-men and -women (as opposed to free-born) occupied a third level of sexual allowance. Those who freed them were considered to be \"owed\" a duty (which may have included sexual services), but were off-limits to everyone else as a free-born would be.\n \n Also, if a free-born man was penetrated even by a slave that man was considered degenerate. A \"real man\" only penetrated others. True homosexual relationships did not openly exist.\n \n \n\n What exactly do you mean by investment?\n\n \n Time and effort, money and resources. When you raise a child you invest your time, effort and money into that child.\n \n \n\n I agree marriage means more to people. But legally that is all it is. \n \n Those benefits dont always apply to those who arnt in a romantic relationship. Benefits such as inheriting all of your spouses property when your spouse dies or making medical decisions for your spouse when they are unable too. Benefits that would protect against things like this.\n\n \n Of course they would still apply. Who cares if those involved are in love or not? It's just a contract between any two people. If I want my best friend to inherit or to make medical decisions, I could marry them. I don't have to actually have any romantic feelings, since it's just a contract.\n \n \n\n But there are age limits to many things such as signing for a loan, driving, owning a weapon, ect. The reason is because they are not old enough to give consent yet. And there is species restrictions because animals cannot give consent.\n\n \n Age of consent is a legal construct just as marriage is. We can change that :)\n \n As for animals, who cares if they can consent? They're animals, not people.\n \n \nMarriage is meaningful to me and other gay people too. Thats why we want to get married. Changing the current state of marriage to allow same sex marriage will not effect straight marriages at all. So whats the big deal with not allowing gay people to be married to someone they love?\n\n \n The big deal is basically what you've said in this post. Marriage is meaningful. It has been a custom that has not included homosexual people (with rare if any exceptions). You want to change that meaning, this custom. When you change the meaning of something that is actually very meaningful to a great deal of people don't be surprised if you tick off a portion of that population.\n \n If your dad took you for walks through a certain park and then died, and you wanted to do the same with your children only someone wants to come in and turn it into a strip mall wouldn't you try to stop them? \n \n \n\n I dont base the significance of ones relationship based on their ability to procreate. So what do you think about couples that are sterile? Does their relationship have the same significance as non sterile couples? And what about gay couples that do end up raising children through adoption, surrogate mothers, or artificial insemination?\n\n \n Your confusing two different points. I said heterosexual attraction is the basis for reproduction. This is true whether or not any particular couple reproduces. Though while we're on the point: Evolution requires reproduction. Any particular person who does not reproduce is an evolutionary dead end, regardless of sexual orientation. \n \n Those who are offended by that statement don't really understand that statement.",

Without it there can be no virtue, and without virtue there can be no liberty.\"\n \n Don't miss the force of that last statement, \"....without virtue there can be no liberty.\" The principle is clear - a lack of virtue engenders bondage.

That is tragic, and I truly sympathize. But speaking about marriage in terms of rights is, imo, erroneous. Love is not a right (at least, not one the gov't can help with).

But to allow homosexual people to get married and obtain the same marital priveleges once married.\n\n \n In the current state of affairs, unmarried homosexual people can marry the same people that unmarried heterosexual people can and obtain the same benefits.

This renders the entire \"gay rights\" argument, as I know it at least, null since the current state of affairs is equal in terms of rights.\n \n \n\n I'd say the majority of gay marriage protestors are against because they feel that their beliefs are morally superior. I don't think many of them are thinking about this in terms of rights ang legal priveleges but in terms of misplaced fear and misundertanding.\n\n \n Oh, I don't think there is much if any misunderstanding or even fear. \"Disgust\" is more likely the emotion involved since disgust is an other-condemning emotion in one of the three moral spheres. It would be similar to the instinctual repulsion toward sex with siblings, which would inspire a \"disgust\" reaction. The only fear that would manifest would be a fear of contamination, since that is why the emotion of disgust evolved in the first place. That is not to excuse the reaction, merely to explain it.\n \n I think there are combination of forces. On an instinctual level I would hazard that heterosexual relationships enjoy the perception of purpose and meaning where homosexual relationships do not. On an intellectual level, as I explained, arguing in terms of \"rights\" seems to be the wrong question to be asking in the first place.\n \n \n\n I agree that this the tradition that has been supported on our society. But I do have to ask, does having children make your love more valid than someone who doesn't?\n\n \n Between heterosexual and homosexual, yes... in a sense. Perception wise, sure.\n \n Consider this: The male sexual mind is easily aroused by a possible sex partner -- indeed, by the faintest hint of a possible sex partner. Zoologists have found that the males of many species will court an enormous range of objects having a vague resemblance to the female: other males, females of the wrong species, females of the right species that have been stuffed and mounted to a board, parts of stuffed females such as a head suspended in midair, even parts of stuffed females with important features missing like the eyes and the mouth. The male of the human species is aroused by the sight of a nude woman, not only in the flesh but in movies, photographs, drawings, postcards, dolls, and bit-mapped cathode-ray-tube displays. \n \n It could be that homosexual love or attraction is seen as having no more meaning, purpose or significance than a creature courting a stuffed animal, in comparison to heterosexual love or attraction. Homosexuality might be seen as a variation that occupies the fringes in the normal distribution of human sexuality.\n \n In that case heterosexual courtship and marriage is seen to have a purpose that is considered beyond the proximate desire for sex, namely creating new life in the form of children. Even if that purpose is ultimately unrealized if the couple has no children, the attraction is still as valid. If two roomates have an equal desire for sex but only one leaves to seek out sex, neither desire for sex is any less valid than the other just because one roomate acted upon the desire and the other did not.\n \n The fact that homosexuals love their partners is irrelevent in this context. There are people who fixate on video game characters, claim to love them and actually attempt to marry them. I believe some successfully have, in other countries (one married his body-pillow with a videogame character on the pillowcase). Also, zoophiles claim to genuinely love their animal partners and I would be hard pressed to say either of these groups are wrong because love is a personal experience. However, I would hazard that the attraction to real females is seen as somehow more 'valid' than the attraction to a videogame character.",

Equality under the law only cares whether everyone can marry the same people. Because that's equal. Truth be told, I have a better chance arguing equality to allow siblings to marry than homosexuality has in arguing its case, imo.\n \n You may want to change marriage so you can marry a member of the same gender, and that may or may not be the morally correct thing to do. But you don't have a right to it.\n\n \n This is common and non-sensical argument. I am suprised anyone actually states this with a \"straight\" face (nyuk). Because the law does not not distinguish between heterosexual and homosexual is precisely the reason equality does not occur. Equal treatment under the law is intended to promote equity and fairness. This does not.\n \n If the law only allowed same-sex marriages, then would that be considered equality? Maybe in some silly rigid sense this is equal, but it is not equitable. When anti-miscegenation laws were on the books, there was equality - everyone was allowed to marry within one's own race. Do you consider that equality?\n \n I am not arguing that marriage is a right - separate issue. But to suggest that the current situation, barring marriage for gays, is an example of equality is absurd. It is only true in the strictest sense of the word, and not in any sense of the spirit of equality. You may argue other reasons to be against gay marriage, but to suggest that the status quo represents equality is silly.",

You cannot marry someone who is already married, an animal, a minor or a sibling. Or someone of the same gender. Or a video game character. Or an inanimate object. Even if you love them. You have to follow the rules to get the benefits. Even if homosexuals can marry it will never be \"you can marry whomever you want\".\n \n \n \n I'm honestly not sure how standing works in the court system. I could only say that white people could not marry the same people that black people could marry.

Now can you answer my question?\n \n How have you shown it is different? \n \n I would still have to say we are still treated unequally.\n \n It depends on what you mean by purpose. And then the idea that since gay people cant reproduce they shouldnt be allowed to marry has already been disproven due to the fact that sterile couples still are allowed to marry.\n \n Let me change my statement then. It is a right to choose who you marry unless the person you want to marry cant give consent.\n \n Im sorry but that doesnt answer my question. Which group was being denied their rights.

   "I've pointed out the biology before. Indiscriminate sexual appetites would be selected against by evolution.\n \n If you think about it the answer should be easy. Heterosexuality represents the vast majority of all people. That would be a bit harder to restrict than, what, 10% of the population that is homosexual? I'm not entirely sure of percentage. We don't allow or deny rights because it's hard or easy but, as I've shown, homosexuals are not denied any rights. You could argue that they are denied acceptance, though\n \n \n \n I'm really not against it. I'm just not really for it either. I haven't been convinced it's a good idea and, imo, that's because any real national discussion can't take place as long as gay-rights proponents insist they are denied rights because they are homosexual. \n \n It could be that it is morally correct to allow homosexual marriage. I don't know if we'll ever know.\n \n \n \n There is also reason to deny it. As I've mentioned, heterosexual relationships are percieved as somehow more valid or as having a purpose that homosexual relationships lack. Imo, ignoring the historical and cultural relevence that heterosxuality has had on not only in the context of marriage but on our species as a whole, since reproduction is the sole reason we exist today, smacks of disrespect. I think that view has some merit.\n \n Of course, you'll reply \"we don't deny rights on this basis\" and then I reply \"it isn't about rights, it's about perception\" etc etc and then we don't actually discuss the issue at all :P\n\n \n However we arnt.

I can also say they have a valid point to make.\n\n \n Obviously we don't no for certain anything that will happen in the future, because we as humans cannot predict it. The purpose of a debate forum is to express your opinion.\n \n \nSince I have said nothing of the sort (sqeamishness?) I cannot really respond to this. However, the concept of homosexual marriage is a very recent one so the claim of sudden and utter misery does not resonate with me, nor would the claim of utter misery since the beginning of time.\n\n \n Where did I use the word \"sudden\"? Homosexuals have been utterly miserable due to persecution of this sort for thousands of years.\n \n \nNo. I don't usually subscribe the the utilitarian viewpoint where an action is moral or immoral based upon the utility (happiness vs unhappiness) gained or lost from the situation. That sort of view can, too often, justify atrocities if it benefits the majority of people.\n \n Besides, I cannot judge whose unhappiness is more worthy of protection.\n\n \n Isn't this hypocritical? Because sacrificing the happiness of the few for the comfort of the many is exactly what you're doing. Correct me If I'm wrong, but am I not the one arguing for the protection of the minority from mob rule?\n \n \nYes, but so what? The traditional view of marriage doesn't necessarily conform to the legal definition. The traditional view of marriage includes sharing children between the couple, meaning reproduction. This view necessarily does not include homosexual relationships.\n\n \n What do the means in which the children come about matter. Homosexual couples can have children. They can't produce them, but they can have them. Therefore your argument is moot.\n \n \nIt matters a heck of a lot if homosexual people have the same rights as heterosexual people. You cannot show that discrimination prevents the exercising of rights that homosexual people have because no one has the rights you claim are being withheld.\n\n \n Yes, I can. Homosexual people are prevented from marrying the ones they love by the government, heterosexuals are not. This isn't a hard concept. The fact that love is not in the legal definition of marriage is irrelevant.\n \n \nThe entire position of the \"gay rights\" position rests on empty air.\n\n \n The opposition rests on something even flimsier. You claim that homosexuals have the same rights as heterosexuals because homosexuals can marry women is totally preposterous. It is not in anyone's nature to marry someone they're not sexually attracted to, despite the fact that there are exceptions (but there are exceptions to everything). Love is the core of marriage, and if you cannot marry the one you love, you cannot marry.\n \n I'm still unclear of your position. You're saying that because homosexual men can marry heterosexual women (and vice versa), everything is dandy and there are no problems?",

Now show me how \"sexual barriers\" are the government's responsibility to remedy.\n \n \n\n Is the person in the wheelchair denied the right to use the stairs?\n\n \n Reasonable equal access to public buildings is the responsibility of government to provide. Since wheelchair-bound people would find it a large physical burden to access these buildings with only stairs, reasonable steps are needed to ensure equal access.\n \n However, in our situation, homosexual people are physically capable of using stairs but they don't want to. To demand escalators under \"equal access\" would not be reasonable. You have equal access, even if you hate stairs with a passion and refuse to use buildings with stairs, because how much you like using the stairs is not the responsibility of the government.\n \n \n\n Veterans have worked hard for their benefits, but heterosexuals were simply born heterosexual. I get what your saying, but benefits shouldn't be given or denied to someone based on the way they are.\n\n \n It isn't automatically ganted for being heterosexual, otherwise you would be right that homosexual people are denied rights. It is not heterosexual versus homosexual, then, it is married versus unmarried. Unmarried people include hetersexual people and homosexual people both, and they have equal rights as well.\n \n Yes, of course I recognize that for heterosexual people they can marry the object of their attraction and homosexual people cannot. However, to whom you are attracted is not within the purview of the government. The government does not care to whom you are attracted.",

   "By no means.\n \n If, for example, I listed dire, but not illegal, consequences if you are allowed to speak your mind you should reply \"it doesn't matter what the consequences are because I have the right to do it\".

   "Shooterandproud, sorry it's been so long for the reply :P\n \n \nYou misunderstand. I am justifying why it is a right.\n\n \n As I understand it you believe marrying whomever you wish should be a right because you don't like the consequences if it is not. That isn't the same thing as this being a right. Whether it should be a right or not is a bit immaterial, since it is very clearly not a right. This can be demonstrated.\n \n \n\n All traditions are meaningful to some people. That doesn't mean we shouldn't change them. You are being sneaky by not picking a side but still attacking my arguments. You're stating fragmented opinions without forming a conclusion on whether gay marriage should be allowed.\n\n \n Yes, traditions can be meaningful! While of course you're right in that we cannot avoid changing traditions on that basis, neither can we ignore that resistance to changing a meaningful custom is reasonable. Given the size, scope, and historical significance of this particular custom, it surprises me not at all that gay right's proponents have had the trouble they have. \n \n I'm baffled why gay proponents are surprised by the resistance, and offended by their characterizations of those who oppose them. I'm attacking your arguments for assumptions you should not be making.\n \n \n\n Sorry, I should've specified. IF it were allowed, what prevents you from marrying another woman?\n\n \n I assume I'm a woman in this scenario.\n \n I'm not sure the thrust of the question. The only barrier to recognition by the government is... recognition by the government. \n \n \n\n They're not. The government has no business dictating who marries who.\n\n \n Well, the problem is that it's pretty well accepted that the government can dictate whom we may not marry. Multiple partners, close relatives, same-sex partners, non-human partners and underage partners are all not recognized as legitimate by the government. There is no clear reason why the government has \"no business\" in one of these but is perfectly legitimate in another of these. In other words, if the government can legitimately regulate what is a recognized relationship in any area, you can no longer keep the government out of relationships entirely.\n \n \n\n And you don't think it would be a \"large burden\" to marry another woman? You stated a case where the government had to make special accommodations for someone who is different. Why does this standard apply to certain types of people and others not?\n\n \n Because access to public buildings is a right that everyone has, therefore the government has the responsibility to ensure that reasonable access exists. There exists no right to marry whomever you love, therefore the government has no responsibility to ensure you can marry whom you love. As long as you have the same access to marriage that everyone else has (namely, the same rules apply to everyone equally), then the government's responsibility ends.\n \n \n\n Homosexuals are incapable of having a happy and successful marriage with someone of the opposite sex. This falls under \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\". Since heterosexuals are provided the means to have a happy marriage and homosexuals are not, homosexuals are not equal to heterosexuals.\n \n Loving marriages are not a right, but the means to have them are.\n\n \n I deny that is so. At the risk of belaboring our poor wheelchaired man, he has the right to reasonable access to the public building but has no real right to how this is accomplished. If either a ramp or an elevator provide equal access then it would be the discretion of the government which was used.\n \n I must point out that marriage, as it is currently thought of, pre-dates the government. The government never provided marriage, it simply gave marriage legal standing. The same wouldn't be true for homosexual unions.",
