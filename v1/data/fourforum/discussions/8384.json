What will end up hapening is that the world will get two Irans as Iraq turns from a secular nation under Sadam to a theocracy under the muslim religious leaders. We haven't liberated anyone just changed the dictator. Why was Sadam ok and supported by the US in the 80's under Reagan but now he becomes a \"a dictator with a Napoleon complex \"? The US knew what he was when we put him in power years ago. I sense the power of the Shrub is at work in your opinion.",

Traditionally balance of force has maintained peace, not destroyed it. N Korea and Iran neither one are going to use nukes unless attacked, and we will not attack as long as they have nuclear deterrents. \n \n Nuclear weapons have never been particularly good military weapons. They are good deterrents, but that is about it because nobody dares use them. They are EXCELLENT weapons for terrorists, and the war in IRaq has spawned a new generation of terrorists that is better trained and more dangerous than ever before.",
