Then you have the audacity to accuse Liberals of being divisive. Stunning.\n \n What's worse, not only do you not justify your refutations (such as they are), but you don't even warrant your constructive. You didn't give a single example of a mainstream liberal saying this election was \"illegitimate.\" Bush WON. We all admit this. Even the hard left sites I've visited (Daily Kos, Mydd, Atrios, Talking Points Memo) have admitted this. We aren't HAPPY about it, but nobody is claiming its illegitimate. And guess what? Democrats are now the opposition, minority party. So, what will we do? We will--survey say--oppose things. That's what the minority does; it acts as a check against the overzealousness of the majority. I'm perfectly willing to join with president Bush if he is willing to work in favor of justice and equality for all Americans. If he isn't, then I will oppose him. Since this is a democracy and it appears I'm in the minority, I might well lose my battle. But to claim I have no right to fight it, well, that's morally abhorrent and plunges a dagger into the heart of what it means to be a loyal, but dissenting, American. Your partisanship is a sad commentary on the state of America, one in which bipartisanship is seen as traitorous and dissent betrayal. That isn't an America that anyone, liberal or conservative, should support. We are strongest when we are free to express all of views, from the most rocksolid majority to the most dested party. Certainly, 47% of the voting population can't all have gone insane, just as 51% of Bush voters aren't mad. The polemical venom that is being espoused here is not only a distortion of reality, but a political cancer that only makes America weaker and an easier target for those who wish to do away with the American ideals of liberty, justice, and equality under the law.\n \n And finally: Barack Obama '08.

Bush has had a Republican Congress for the last 4 years but unfortunately not enough of a majority to guarantee that all credit or blame can be put on him, and that hasn't changed for the new Congress either.

Wanting to see failure and expecting to see it are two entirely different things. Much as I thought Kerry could have been one of the greats, the time was wrong. Reality is that he'd have been facing a Republican Congress and a daily fight - gridlock. His would have been a 1 term presidency. I expect Iraq to get uglier by the day and nobody can stop what's rolling down hill. Terrorism (an entirely different subject) -- we've barely addressed it. We're 3 years late in effectively starting. Securing our borders is a myth. If little Israel, after pouring their heart and soul into it, can't do it, we certainly can't. Sheer size alone shows that. What was that number? 4,000 a day from Mexico. The only thing that's holding the terrorists back is us on the lookout for skin color and an accent. As soon as the terrorists decide to target us using the same tactics as Israel (malls and restaurants), attitudes will change real quick. Roadside bombs in the heartland. Think about it. A couple of those in Montana. Stop thinking of the dramatic. Total randomness - probably in the red states. OBL watches the election returns too. Remember what a couple of snipers did last year? Did they ever catch the anthrax people? That's terror. We have yet to really taste it. It wasn't politically correct for either candidate to tell the truth about that. The next 4 or more years are going to be violent, bloody, and scarey. I think that the philosophy that we can fight the war over there instead of over here has to be allowed to play out to it's logical conclusion. Only then can it be put to bed -- when we're too concerned about ourselves to paint rosey pictures about spreading democracy. The fact is that we're in this pickle because of our desire to control foreign governments. Both parties have been guilty of that. Thus far, our response has been to send in the troops and beat them into submission. And the \"them\" isn't even the right \"them\". Four years from now, my vote will go to whomever seems more likely to keep his nose clean in foreign affairs - just as it did this time. We have a policy of not dealing with terrorists. All they asked was for us to go home. Seems pretty easy to me. We're all bent out of shape because they didn't ask nicely. Well, nicely didn't work. That's why I say \"ours isn't such a bad spot\". The result, I hope, of one party, with unfettered control will ultimately be the shortest distance between the two points.

I can't tell if you're disagreeing with your own city school board or the rural school boards.\nWho yells? Residents. All of them. Residents want local control. And the school boards are in way over their heads. A very high percentage of school funding comes from local property taxes. That's why rural areas have such a hard time. They can't raise the $ out there. The amount of money per student per year can swing by thousands depending on what town you live in. Things as basic as graduation requirements can differ from one district to the next. Although they stabalized somewhat when the state started requiring 9th grade proficiency tests. You heard it right. 9th grade. That was about 1990. In my district, the optional 12th grade test got you an honors diploma. This is what plumbers are figuring out. They're not just playing with the petty cash. They're not deciding whether to paint the gym or buy a new monkey bars. They're deciding whether to give the teachers a raise or require 10th grade math. Teachers tend to win by the way. Or better yet, they're plotting how to arm twist the residents into another levy. They like to threaten to cancel the school buses if they don't get more money. These school boards need guidance. I've seen administrators that need a firm hand. They're setting policy for corporal punishment in their own district. Dr. Phil is their best resource. Oh yeah. Rules for hitting children is in the handbook. After all, if we get sued it's our own money. In this state, you'd better know something about the school district before you move in there.

   "Actually, I've always advocated more control at the state level and less at the local level - including money. I was a lone voice BEFORE our method of school funding was declared unconstitutional. I for one think that somebody's plumber father who ran for the school board isn't qualified. I'm sure he's a fine plumber - so plumb. Leave education to the educators. As a city slicker, that was my thoughts on the subject -- and it had nothing to do with my own town's school financing. That train of thought meets with great resistance. In unison, they yell we want local control. What they want is local control but state money. Local people like to think that their problems are special. They're not special. A city school is a city school. A suburban school is a suburban school. A rural school is a rural school. Actually, these all powerful school boards are just a bunch of unqualified people stumbling around in the dark attempting to reinvent the wheel. So that's the insurmountable problem. Too much control at the local level and nobody wants to give up their little power base OR THEIR MONEY. And the other 49 states are just itching to join us in our local control problems.\n\n \n Federal control of school is definitely the wrong way to go. State control MIGHT be better, but only marginally. Once you get beyond the local level, you get the \"everybody should have equal education opportunity\" mentality but with a lot of short-pocketed participants. As a result, the wealthier school districts pay a disproportionate amount of their property taxes to the have-nots who choose to live where running water is a luxury. ;)\n I live in a moderate sized city with our local school board controlling a budget of over $100Million per year for 14000+ students. Nine years ago, I ran for a position on the School Board. I quickly found out that local school boards in a unionized district are typically teacher union puppets recruited from the ranks of PTA members. I didn't fit that mold, so the union went after me with a vengence. I actually used the \"A\" word and it scared the Hell out of them. The \"A\" word....accountability.",

I didn't fit that mold, so the union went after me with a vengence. I actually used the \"A\" word and it scared the Hell out of them. The \"A\" word....accountability.\nYou understand the issues. You just haven't seen it taken to the extreme that Ohio has taken it. I've never advocated federal control, but the states aren't doing so well. I grew up and was educated in New York State. I raised my kids in Ohio. The school differences are night and day.\n \n New York keeps an iron grip on the schools. The vast majority of the $ comes from the state and the schools toe the line. They can't afford to open the doors without state money. The one bad thing that I remember there was the problems involved in a snow day. Lost revenue. They'd rather transport us and send us home early rather than not open at all. No child left behind probably had no great impact on them. They've been doing Regents testing since god made little green apples. Rural kids there get educated, too. Granted, they may not have all the extras that come from local property taxes. But minimums are met and the minimums are fairly high from an educational point of view.\n \n The problem in Ohio is that it's the state that's charged with the responsibility of educating children. Ohio has pushed too much of that off on to the localities. We have, to the max, what everybody THINKS they want. My local property taxes support my local schools and the money is controlled by my locally elected \"officials\". That would be the plumber that I referred to earlier. He's the guy holding the entire tax base hostage. And you're absolutely correct that these school boards are puppets for local administrators and unions. There's some state money. But not enough to build that school for the 100 kids you referred to. There's a huge disparity in educational opportunities not only between rural and city but between towns. So the state simply set the standards low enough to accomodate the poorest districts.\n \n The point of this conversation was to answer the question \"What have the cities given to the rural areas besides a market place and a hard time?\" Eviidently in the other 49 states, enough money to educate their children. I can jump to that conclusion because the other 49 aren't unconstitutional.\n \n Having lived in both New York and Ohio, I quickly came to the conclusion that the wastefulness of this locally controlled school system must be outrageous. New York, long known as land of taxes, charged me the same thing that I pay in Ohio. Only the quantity and quality of services aren't even close to equal. Ohio state taxes are lower, but the localities more than make up for it.\n \n I personally think that what I've seen here indicates only the positives in controlling education at a level higher than localities. There's lots of $ involved. When control of that money is raised to a level (such as the state) where the decisions can be made without a personal vested interest, better decisions are made. When there's a way to personally profit, such as teacher salaries, and number of paid aides who make the teacher's lives easier, good judgment and the best interest of the children can go right out the window. We actually have districts in this state that are closing their cafeterias to save the cook's salary. And we have districts where teachers can make $80,000 a year. Somebody made a wrong turn somewhere.\n \n I can't agree with you that rural kids somehow deserve less education. I will agree that if they don't want to pay for a pool and swimming lessons during gym, no great loss. However, they deserve a calculus class. They deserve the opportunity to choose their path in life - including moving to the city WITH an education.\n \n Word on the street (from my daughter-iin-law who is a teacher) is that not a teacher in Ohio voted for GWB. We've got enough problems here without his unfunded interference.",

   "You understand the issues. You just haven't seen it taken to the extreme that Ohio has taken it. I've never advocated federal control, but the states aren't doing so well. I grew up and was educated in New York State. I raised my kids in Ohio. The school differences are night and day.\n\n \n I grew up in NJ and raised my kids in Michigan. My kids' schools are infinitely superior to the \"Combat High\" that I attended in NJ. (My HS was used in the movie Jersey Girl). It's a small HS that had ~1000 students from 4 small towns combined. \n I've found that education is highly dependent on location here in Michigan. We go from bankrupt schools that the state has to bail out to World Class Blue Ribbon Schools (like the one my kids attended). Property values are highly dependent on the local school district and many people use the school district as a big selling point for houses. For example, if there are two near identival properties on opposite sides of the street that divides school districts, the one in the better school district can cost $10k more for that fact alone.\n \n\n New York keeps an iron grip on the schools. The vast majority of the $ comes from the state and the schools toe the line. They can't afford to open the doors without state money. The one bad thing that I remember there was the problems involved in a snow day. Lost revenue. They'd rather transport us and send us home early rather than not open at all. No child left behind probably had no great impact on them. They've been doing Regents testing since god made little green apples. Rural kids there get educated, too. Granted, they may not have all the extras that come from local property taxes. But minimums are met and the minimums are fairly high from an educational point of view.\n\n I'm a ig believer in standardized testing to monitor a school's performance. That's one of the reasons that the local NEA put up $10k to defeat me in a school board election. :)\n \n\n The problem in Ohio is that it's the state that's charged with the responsibility of educating children. Ohio has pushed too much of that off on to the localities. We have, to the max, what everybody THINKS they want. My local property taxes support my local schools and the money is controlled by my locally elected \"officials\". That would be the plumber that I referred to earlier. He's the guy holding the entire tax base hostage. And you're absolutely correct that these school boards are puppets for local administrators and unions. There's some state money. But not enough to build that school for the 100 kids you referred to. There's a huge disparity in educational opportunities not only between rural and city but between towns. So the state simply set the standards low enough to accomodate the poorest districts.\n\n I'm a believer in local control of curriculum, but have more pragmatic concerns with fiscal control for the reasons enunciated before. \n \n\n The point of this conversation was to answer the question \"What have the cities given to the rural areas besides a market place and a hard time?\" Eviidently in the other 49 states, enough money to educate their children. I can jump to that conclusion because the other 49 aren't unconstitutional.\n\n Living in a city, I see most of my money heading out of my county and into poorer ones.\n \n\n Having lived in both New York and Ohio, I quickly came to the conclusion that the wastefulness of this locally controlled school system must be outrageous. New York, long known as land of taxes, charged me the same thing that I pay in Ohio. Only the quantity and quality of services aren't even close to equal. Ohio state taxes are lower, but the localities more than make up for it.\n\n Be careful with your generalities. I remember seeing exposes on NY school janitors/maintenance workers who get paid outrageous salaries and rarely show up for work as well as huge theft problems from school supply warehouses in NY.\n \n\n I personally think that what I've seen here indicates only the positives in controlling education at a level higher than localities. There's lots of $ involved. When control of that money is raised to a level (such as the state) where the decisions can be made without a personal vested interest, better decisions are made. \n\n I totally disagree. The farther from the grassroots that educational decisions are made, the more impersonal and bureaucratic they tend to be. Show me one function that the Feds can do more efficiently than local municipalities.\n \n\n When there's a way to personally profit, such as teacher salaries, and number of paid aides who make the teacher's lives easier, good judgment and the best interest of the children can go right out the window. We actually have districts in this state that are closing their cafeterias to save the cook's salary. And we have districts where teachers can make $80,000 a year. Somebody made a wrong turn somewhere.\n\n That is the area that you and I agree on. Local school district control of salaries is highly suspect here in MI. The school board puppets do what the unions expect them to do...grant raises in excess of inflation. In my district, teachers were getting double digit raises when workers in industry were getting 2-3% raises at best. \n \n\n I can't agree with you that rural kids somehow deserve less education. I will agree that if they don't want to pay for a pool and swimming lessons during gym, no great loss. However, they deserve a calculus class. They deserve the opportunity to choose their path in life - including moving to the city WITH an education.\n\n In Michigan, funding WAS strictly a local issue and when it was many rural districts continued to vote against local millage increases to fund education. As a result, their schools deteriorated as did their property values. I think that it was wrong for responsible property taxpayers to have to pick up this burden because others were too cheap to fund their own schools.\n With Michigan's newer funding process, schools are guaranteed a fixed amount that is sufficient to provide for basic education. Any additional funding is handled by local millages.\n \n\n Word on the street (from my daughter-iin-law who is a teacher) is that not a teacher in Ohio voted for GWB. We've got enough problems here without his unfunded interference.\n\n \n I'm not surprised. In a big NEA state like Ohio, they are heavy supporters of liberal Democrats and represent one of the DNC's largest PACs. \n :xcensored",

The farther from the grassroots that educational decisions are made, the more impersonal and bureaucratic they tend to be. Show me one function that the Feds can do more efficiently than local municipalities.\nEfficiency isn't the issue. Nor do I think that efficiency is lost if it's a state board that says 9th grade Engilish consists of grammar. 10th grade is composition. Etc. Quite to the contrary, I don't think that local somebody's should make the decision to change methodology in teaching reading from phonics to that sight word memorization method that was such a dismal failure. If you're asking me can and should locals make decisions regarding Home Ec and Shop class - fine. That's frills. Just what are these huge educational decisions that are better decided at a local level? Why does a kid in one town need less math and english than a kid in another town?\n \n \nThat is the area that you and I agree on. Local school district control of salaries is highly suspect here in MI. The school board puppets do what the unions expect them to do...grant raises in excess of inflation. In my district, teachers were getting double digit raises when workers in industry were getting 2-3% raises at best. \nSame here. This is where the huge wastefulness comes in. The amount of money far outweighs anything that a janitor stole in NY. In combination with what you said about property values, taxpayers have their feet to the fire. The school board has it within their power to ruin the reputation and sale value of an entire town. It's nothing short of extortion.\n \n \nIn Michigan, funding WAS strictly a local issue and when it was many rural districts continued to vote against local millage increases to fund education. As a result, their schools deteriorated as did their property values.

Any additional funding is handled by local millages.\nBasic education. That's the key phrase. I'm just of the opinion that that's the way to go. Frills only should be locally funded. If the voters want to pay for it, feel free. I can't make generalizations about what makes some towns to cheap. Some towns have had their major employers close and the town, as a whole, is broke. Should that start a trickle down to their children where the next generation is ignorant? That's not in anybody's best interest.\n \n \nI'm not surprised. In a big NEA state like Ohio, they are heavy supporters of liberal Democrats and represent one of the DNC's largest PACs. \n :xcensored\nThe problem here is strictly a money issue.

   "Just put the party differences aside and support the President in his efforts to improve the country and protect the people in it.\nJim, It has nothing to do with parties. I've said before that I'm a registered independent. That's appropriate and correct because that's what I am. I've never voted a party ticket, until this year. And I didn't do it now for party reasons. I did it in a small effort to try to restore the balance of power.\n \n What I can't put aside is ideological differences - not between the parties but between GWB and myself. I actually believe that America is a better place when we educate ALL of our children - even the ones on the farms. The president said he believed that too with NO child left behind. I can't justify tax cuts when there are kids who are loosing the cafeteria in their school - and that doesn't even touch on poor test scores and class sizes that are too large. If he could do it all, I'd try to support him. But I don't see where he makes an effort. He speaks to the greedy and runs on a family values platform. What's more family values than education.\n \n I was honestly confused for a very long time. I didn't understand that family values means my own family - not all families. GWB's plan is for those who can afford it to send their kids to a private school while the rest go hang. That's not making America better. It's not even making it better for the kids in the private schools.\n \n My sons, during their high school dating years, both swore off of dating girls from private schools. It became a hard and fast rule for them. They had some bad experiences. Every one they dated turned out to be a druggie or a slut. I remember one girl in particular. My son invited her to homecoming. She was adorable. Cute little brunette in a black and white strapless. She was Eddie Haskel. Between the invitatiion and the dance, he found out about her drug usage when she offered him some. He took her to the dance anyway since she'd already bought her gown and was home by 11:00. Certainly, that's a generalization, and I'm sure there are lots of nice girls there. But it's the conclusion they came to from first hand observations -- and it is, at least in my mind, confirmation that all is not wonderful there either. I can still her on my door step. Who'd ever guess. She looked like a cheerleader. So, where are we going to be when the public system shrinks and is no longer equipped to handle education for all, and the private system isn't what it was held up to be.\n \n Maybe my kids just told me too much for me to have my head in the sand.

Should we judge those teachers differently? \n \n I reccomend that teachers are rated on: 1) their observations (random) by their administrators 2) their peers opinions of their work 3) comments by parents 4) and finally their students improvement (or lack-there-of) on test scores.\n \n Finally, on the subject of testing...... If you can't measure it, how can you fix it?\n \n regards..... (p.s. I don't have a spell checker, and I know my spelling stinks, so please excuse any spelling errors!)\n\n \n Where were you 10 years ago when I ran for school board in an NEA-controlled school district and preached just what you said above. The local NEA thought I was the anti-Christ. \n emoticon_rolleyes",

   "Quite simply, any service paid for by tax dollars will have a tough time keeping pace with it's private industry counterpart. Education is funded by tax dollars and people will always be against tax increases.\nNo. I don't think that people are automatically against tax increases for education. We're on the right track when we talk about accountability - but the wrong train. What we lack is financial accountability. We all understand that we get what we pay for. The problem comes in when we're not sure we're receiving good value.\n \n To Faeden. Teachers, especially grammar school, joke about what they hear of home life. Nothing is private. What teachers have chosen not to see is that information highway goes both ways. What I'm trying to say is that parents have complaints. Unfortunately, the voting booth is our way of expressing them. My kids had many good teachers. They also had some terrible ones. Boy could I tell some stories.\n \n How about the 4th grade teacher and the music teacher that were making out in the bathroom. And the kids knew it. They're not stupid. My son was an aid in the cafeteria. First one teacher would go in. Then a few minutes later the other one. The kids noticed that nobody came out in between. We were in the principal's office screaming. She did her best to shrug us off. Maybe it was her form of damage control. But I'll never know if that impacted either of their employment situations. It certainly should have. But I have no reason to think it did. I know the music teacher got promoted.\n \n How about the 11th grade Chemistry teacher who told the class they were going to pair up on their lab reports (and share grades) so she could grade half as many papers. What was she thinking.\n \n The kids come home and tell it all.\n \n I wish I had some good stories to tell. It's not that they don't exist. It's just that they aren't remarkable. They went to school. They came home happy and knew something that they didn't know when they left home. That's what's supposed to happen.\n \n Certainly, we complain more than compliment. I'd like to see some formal way for parents to evaluate teachers. We know more than we're given credit for. Our information is quite likely invaluable. When we have issues, each one of us feels alone. We wonder if there's been a string of people with the same complaint being ignored. And sometimes we keep quiet for fear of retaliation. We want a voice. And we want it to be heard. Until we get it, there's going to be trouble at the polls. As it stands, dealing with the school system can be about as much fun as motor vehicles.",

One of my favorites is \"Statutory Debt Limit\" (SDL) which purports to limit the amount the government can borrow. The Gov goes its merry way spending by the bucketful until the magic number is reached, then they simply raise the number and, Presto!, a new limit, and they go back to spending. Instead of being one of the checks and balances, it becomes a blank check. I would purpose to eliminate this fruitless exercise with a new statute, \"Statute To Unlimited Plunging Into Debt\" (STUPID), which would save the time and expense of the current system. This statute could be included in a spending bill and would therefore not be subject to veto. When asked about the veto recently, the President replied that he loved Italians. Another aid in our fiscal dilemma would be a national lottery to pick when the debt will reach $8 trillion and if everybody bought a ticket we could offset a few hours of interest.

That's why a $500k 9/11 costing us untold trillions and the financial sinkhole of Iraq makes them successful. They know domestic spending by both parties will continue regardless of who happens to be in office due to our ever-expanding social ills and pathetic attempts to develop a one size fits all society based on hypocritical Christian values. Aggressive military spending with little or no economic return has been the downfall of most empires.\n \n I view no difference between either party's spending habits. Both have always known the easiest way to popularity is spending public money, supposedly on the public to 'protect' them or 'assure their quality of life'. As a life-long Republican I fail to see any traditional conservative values displayed by the current administration. They've expanded the size of the federal government at a record rate, pushed federal spending programs to state levels complete with federal compliance strangleholds to increase conventional military spending at record rates when threats against us are non-conventional, initiated social programs that would put any Democrat to shame and displayed complete fiscal irresponsibility in cutting taxes in a time of reduced revenue to buy votes. We're our own worst enemy.\n\n \n If we increase military spending to the point that our enemies are defeated, they won't be succesful. \n \n Since one party seeks to tax more than the other, I see a difference in the party's spending habits.

No wonder why conservatives/republicans creamed their jeans in 2004...their president finally won not only the popular vote but managed to attain it after spending record deficits, losing the lives of 4,200 Americans, distorting his way into a war, destroying the WTC, failing to capture bin Laden, doing a complete 180 on nearly all of his campaign promises while condemning Kerry as a flip-flopper and etc..\n This is indeed quite an accomplishment. However to not to any moral or political sense. \n Congrats to Limbaugh and other conservative propaganda artists and spin masters!\n \n \n \"Liberalism is Dead; Long live the Constitution.\"\n \n Liberals wrote the Constitution.",

The 1930's great depression ended in a society that was nowhere near bogged down in the massive domestic government that we have today. With things like emissions testing, endangered species acts, and all our emotional safety and environmental concerns, I don't think we are going to have the flexibility to work our way out of another depression as well as we did that one.

   "Not kidding at all. Powell is a strong advocate for affirmative action, for example. That's certainly not a Conservative position. He's more of a social moderate. And, despite all the good he's done, I can't help but fault him for NOT pushing for the removal of SH at the end of Gulf War 1. he allowed the US to cave in to the UN and NOT do what was in the world's best interests. As a result, we had to fight Gulf War 2 at a much greater human and financial cost.\n\n All the military leaders then (as well as the pres) thought that removing SH would have led to the very situation we are in now, an intractable quagmire. The current neo-con administration did not have the forsight to realize this. \n \n [EDIT: Here is a quote from Colin Powell in 1992:\n \n\"Saddam Hussein is a terrible person, he is a threat to his own people. I think his people would be better off with a different leader, but there is this sort of romantic notion that if Saddam Hussein got hit by a bus tomorrow, some Jeffersonian democrat is waiting in the wings to hold popular elections. You're going to get -- guess what -- probably another Saddam Hussein. It will take a little while for them to paint the pictures all over the walls again -- but there should be no illusions about the nature of that country or its society. And the American people and all of the people who second-guess us now would have been outraged if we had gone on to Baghdad and we found ourselves in Baghdad with American soldiers patrolling the streets two years later still looking for Jefferson.\" -Colin Powell, chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 1992.\n sorry, but if that's not prophecy...]\n \n \n On the affirmative action deal: I think the reason Powell is in favor of it is because he is a result of it:\n http://slate.msn.com/id/2097/\n \nShe offers as an example Powell's promotion to brigadier general by President Carter's Secretary of the Army Clifford Alexander. When originally sent an all-white list of candidates for the position, Alexander rejected it, demanding a list that included some blacks. From the revised list, Alexander chose Powell.\n\n \n And even folks like Bush and Kerry are the result of affirmative action of sorts. They both come from money and priviledge. This (despite appearances) puts them at the top of the list when it comes to Ivy League admissions or capital investment.\n \n \nI never said Bush was a conservative.

   "we have a $7 Billion EPA, but 3 years after 9-11-01 it's the MILITARY who is the source of alllllllll our financial problems!!!!!!\n\n I just wanted to make sure that this was well seen.\n http://www.military.com/NewsContent/0,13319,FL_cost_111804,00.html?ESRC=eb.nl\n \nIraq War Topping $5.8 Billion A Month\n United Press International\n November 18, 2004\n \n WASHINGTON - The Pentagon is spending more than $5.8 billion a month on the war in Iraq, according to the military's top generals.\n \n That is nearly a 50 percent increase above the $4 billion-a-month benchmark the Pentagon has used to estimate the cost of the war so far.\n \n The Army alone is spending $4.7 million a month while the Air Force is spending $800 million a month transporting soldiers and flying combat missions. The Marine Corps is spending $300 million a month, the four service chiefs told the House Armed Services Committee Wednesday.\n \n Since 2003, the Pentagon has received some $160 billion for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in supplemental funding -- that is, in addition to its annual budget. It will be requesting another multibillion-dollar supplement early next year to cover the continuing cost of the war. \n\n So the EPA has an annual budget of $7b, while the war in Iraq has a monthly budget of almost that.\n \n \nOur enemies want to bleed us out all right. They would like us to cut back the military enabling our enemies to grow, and increase useless domestic spending to bleed us out. Just like the Democrats. Can Democrats point out any differences between themselves and our enemies?\n\n Yes, the more we use our military in offense, the more our enemies grow.\n \n \nI disagree. I'm guessing that the 2,000 terrorist bodies taken out of Fallujah this week had an impact on international terrorism and terrorists.\n emoticon_rolleyes\n\n Then George Washington was a terrorist.\n \n And no, the people we murdered in Fallujah only helped to increase the numbers of arabs and muslims that hate the US and are willing to take up arms and fight us.\n \n \nWe've proven in the past that we don't extend our country.\n\n We don't annex land per se (since 1867), we have a different kind of empire. We put up military bases. We don't need to annex land and set up expensive and hard-to-control colonial govts when all we have to do is intimidate people with our military and (waning) economic might. \n \n \nAny Iraqi should know that the less they fight us the sooner we'll pull out.\n\n They are smart enough to realize that we will never \"pull out.\" Our bases will always be there to \"protect the interests of the Iraqi people\" which means protect the oil exports. The govt will be mostly a puppet of ours. They realize this and want no part of it. They are rebelling against tyrrany.\n \n \nInstalling a democracy there wasn't our number one mission, removing Hussien and fighting a WAR ON TERROR was.\n\n Ok, if removing SH was our #1 priority, what was supposed to go in his place? \n So part of the #1 priority was most definitely to install a puppet govt (i mean a democracy, of course). \n \n Or maybe you're right. Maybe the admin had no idea what they were going to do once they removed SH. Maybe their plan was to just keep \"FIGHTIN' The War on Terra.\" Looks like their plan is going swimmingly then.\n \n \nIf Iraqi's choose to allow themselves to be recruited by terrorists, then they are terrorists. A large percentage of Iraqi's WANT a democracy.\n\n \n When someone takes up arms and fights an organized army that has far superior weapons you can hardly call him a terrorist.

   "In response to anyone who said that a majority of Iraqis support the occupation:\n \n http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5217874/site/newsweek/\n \n \nJune 15 - The first survey of Iraqis sponsored by the U.S. Coalition Provisional Authority after the Abu Ghraib prison scandal shows that most say they would feel safer if Coalition forces left immediately, without even waiting for elections scheduled for next year. An overwhelming majority, about 80 percent, also say they have \"no confidence\" in either the U.S. civilian authorities or Coalition forces.\n \n Sixty-seven percent of those surveyed also said they believed violent attacks have increased around the country because \"people have lost faith in the Coalition forces.\"\n \n The poll numbers were reflected in the anger seen in the streets of Baghdad after a series of car bombings on Monday. While U.S forces and Iraqi police hung back, crowds set some of the vehicles on fire, threw bricks and shouted insults at U.S. soldiers. According to the poll, a mere 1 percent of Iraqis now feel that the Coalition forces contribute most to their sense of security; only 18 percent described Iraqi police the same way. By contrast, a total of 71 percent said they depended mostly on their family and friends and neighbors for security. \n\n \n http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2004-04-28-poll-cover_x.htm\n \nPoll: Iraqis out of patience\n By Cesar G. Soriano and Steven Komarow,USA TODAY\n BAGHDAD - Only a third of the Iraqi people now believe that the American-led occupation of their country is doing more good than harm, and a solid majority support an immediate military pullout even though they fear that could put them in greater danger, according to a new USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll.\n ...\n The poll shows that most continue to say the hardships suffered to depose Saddam Hussein were worth it. Half say they and their families are better off than they were under Saddam. And a strong majority say they are more free to worship and to speak.\n \n But while they acknowledge benefits from dumping Saddam a year ago, Iraqis no longer see the presence of the American-led military as a plus. Asked whether they view the U.S.-led coalition as \"liberators\" or \"occupiers,\" 71% of all respondents say \"occupiers.\"\n\n They must just be ungrateful, or maybe they've been listening to Michael Moore. emoticon_rolleyes",

One difference between this one and WW2 however, the Axis powers never attacked the U.S mainland with the severity that terrorists did 3 years ago.\n \n \n \nWhy isn't a person that fights against an organized army NOT a terrorist? That's your question? If a person straps a bomb to himself and kills soldiers in the middle of a war then by definition he is NOT a terrorist, but a resistance fighter (if he's not to be called a soldier). Terrorists kill civilians for political purposes. \n\n \n When \"resistance fighters\" become allies with terrorists, then they become the enemy.\n \n \nYou think I watch that carp (or believe it anyway)? \n\n \n I just assumed you did. Guess I was wrong. You assumed at the other forum that I watch a lot of television. You were wrong too - I seldom watch television.

Seems \"situational ethics\" is alive and well on both sides .... as always.\n Dono\n\n \n Ordinarily, I'd agree with that assessment, but if you peel back the sound bytes, you find that the prosecutor involved has a history of unfounded indictments. This is the same prosecuter, Ronnie Earle, that went after Sen. Kay Baily Hutchinson and had the charges later dropped.\n \n \n \n Putnam Backed GOP Rule Change\n \n By Bill Rufty\n The Ledger\n \n LAKELAND -- U.S. Rep. Adam Putnam, R-Bartow, said he voted for the compromise in Republican House rules covering suspension of House GOP leaders, who are indicted in state courts, but that he would not have voted for the proposal that would have totally exempted committee chairs and other leaders from state indictments.\n \n The issue has arisen because of a potential Texas grand jury indictment on political corruption against Majority Leader Tom DeLay.\n \n \"It would have been to me rather hypocritical to have said that we are above state law, but not above federal law,\" Putnam said. \"The initial package stated that House Republican leaders would be excluded from state courts, but not federal courts. But there is total agreement on the final package (with the compromise),\" he said.\n \n The final rule unanimously approved by the Republican Conference, made up of all Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives, requires the Conference's steering committee to investigate any indictment of a party leader in the House within 30 days and present a recommendation to the entire Republican House Conference, which would then decide whether to remove that leader.\n \n Putnam said that this is a GOP conference rule and not a rule of the whole House of Representatives. The Democrats, he said, have no rule regarding their leaders being indicted.\n \n \"There is an agreed upon solution, but it is a lousy way to start the year,\" Putnam said. \"The rationale for this (pending indictment against Delay in Texas) appears to be the action of a rather partisan-driven state attorney, who has a history of indicting political figures, particularly Republicans. He even pushed an indictment against (Republican U.S. Sen.) Kay Baily Hutchinson that was summarily dismissed.\"\n \n Republicans had a rule on the books since 1994 requiring the suspension of party leaders within the Congress who receive criminal indictments.\n http://www.theledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?Date=20041118&Category=NEWS&ArtNo=411180486&SectionCat=&Template=printart\n \n",

In honesty I must admit that some of the changed districts were previously gerrymandered by the Democrats.\n \n \nI think they changed the rule to require a federal indictment for removal.

   "So the authority of the UN trumps the authority of the U.S.?\n\n Of course not, we have veto power in the UN. The US always trumps the UN. Less powerful countries get trumped by the UN (via the US).\n \n The UN is OUR tool (for the most part). \n It ultimately (not entirely) protects the interests of 5 countries.\n This time 2 of the five countries had different goals that the other 3.\n \n And besides, you are the one saying that we should have invaded based on what the UN said. I was just extending the logic.\n \n \nI did read the article, but it didn't break things down very far to make the figures more believable. They may have had some tricky way to come up with those astounding figures that are misleading. It wouldn't be the first time. What would be interesting would be to also show the total amount the Federal government takes in in taxes, in one month. Then to see the total amount the Vietnam war cost per month in, say 1968. Then show the total amount the Federal government collected in taxes per month in 1968. I'd bet those 4 figures together, instead of one sensational figure, would go a long way in showing how wasteful our domestic spending has become.\n\n I don't know where they got the numbers. They probaly used a calculator or something.\n \n And you really want to champion some kind of slashing of domestic spending, don't you? There's pork everywhere, why start at home? Cut the pork from the defense budgets and watch the money roll back in. Everything has pork, not just domestic spending, but defense pork totally blows domestic pork out of the water. A lot of stuff isn't even classified as pork, but in my book when ONE plane costs $1billion, that's porkish.\n \n\n You can keep saying it over and over, but that doesn't make it more true. No one person is almighty enough to know that for sure. Plenty of people disagree with it.\n\n Plenty of people disagree with the fact that our soldiers are dying faster and faster? Plenty of people disagree that AQ has GROWN in size and funding despite the fact that we have captured or killed thousands of their followers?\n It must be the old head in the sand thing again.\n \n Look, you can disbeleive all you want, but it's a fact that more muslims hate us after the Iraq invasion than before.\n \n \nThis, and your following quote from another forum, seem to indicate that you don't agree with hardly any major event in this country since 1776. It's no surprise that you disagree with the current administration.\n\n Huh? You said the last 6-7 decades. I said that I disagree with our foreign policy in certain places. Those were the places where our policies favored brutality and fascism and opposed democracy and freedom. Now, you say I disagree with everything we've ever done as a country? LAME.\n \n \n \nWhat a crime THAT is LOL!\n \n\n That was nice of you to try to mix up posts like that. \n \n Here's the original:\n \nHmm, something tells me they don't want either. Actually, the Sunni minority supported SH. The Shiites want a Shiite govt. The Kurds want their own govt, and pretty much have that now. Now, do they just get a choice between the lesser of 2 evils? They are becoming more like America every day.\n\n Here I was saying that we Americans are used to picking the lesser of two evils in elections and then suggesting Iraqis will soon be doing the same (if all goes according to plan).\n \nWhat a crime THAT is LOL!\n \n\n It may not be a crime but it is tragic.\n \n \nI think there is - there are many similarities. I think this one is just as winable, and can have the same closure. It's more comparable to WW2 than it is Vietnam, because we learned from the mistakes we made in Vietnam. One difference between this one and WW2 however, the Axis powers never attacked the U.S mainland with the severity that terrorists did 3 years ago.\n\n You are truly deluded.\n Japan attacked US territory using it's military as a pre-emptive strike because of actions taken by us in the pacific that were threatening to them. Afterwards, Hitler declared war on the US. He was going to wait until he conquered England and Russia, but saw an opportunity when the US had to fight on 2 fronts. \n \n Now, \"the terrorists\" of which you speak were from Al-Qeada (remember?)\n \n Now, what did AQ have to do with Iraq? O yeah, they were enemies.\n \n This war is like Vietnam. It was started by us for colonial interests all under the guise of protecting America from a phantom threat (WMDs in this case, communism in vietnam). \n \n In WWII, our very survival as a nation (and the rest of the world's too) was at stake. This was not the case in Vietnam or in Iraq, but the politicians told us so anyway.\n \n \nWhen \"resistance fighters\" become allies with terrorists, then they become the enemy.\n\n You got proof that any of these people are allied with actual terrorists?\n You can say the name zarqawi, but you won't convince me that he is anything real.\n \n \n \nI just assumed you did. Guess I was wrong. You assumed at the other forum that I watch a lot of television. You were wrong too - I seldom watch television.
