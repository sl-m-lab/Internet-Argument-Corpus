The reasonable person can say that we need to have a family that is compost of both sexes to create stable children. It is a fact that children without involved fathers are more likey to have problems as adults, and I would be safe to venter the same is true if they do not have active mothers. And with out a mother to play the mother role and the father to play the his role how does anyone expect our socitiy to build strong families. Normaly in such relations of homosexualty there are more or less domian roles, but not in the same method that they are in a hetreosexual family. To the child, the lines are not as ovbious, and may be confusing. Confusing children is the starting process leading them down the wrong path. For some reason, nature as desided this one for us, and we can not be what we are not, and therefor we must promote the cavepeople apoarch (Many may think I am a caveman for saying that women should be the mother and men the father, I guess I was one of the last beaver cleavers). Its even more important in todays socity where it is so easy to get sucked into trouble with just one wrong move.\n \n However (if this message is not long enough), people do have the right to fredom of assoation, so therefor this is nothing wrong with homosexual reationships, but they can not be promoted by the state, becuase the state has no betift in doing such.",

This is the flaw in the conservative interpretation of the constitution. They are so obsessed with what is not explicitly a \"right\" (there is no right to look at pornography, there is no right to engage in homosexual conduct) that they forget the fundamental rights that banning these actions violate (right to privacy/speech, right to privacy/association).\n I sincerely doubt that these children will grow up \"Confused\" about the roles of men and women (even assuming that we should teach them to be locked into \"roles\" in the first place).

So saying that Jesus is not here to condemn is completely different than saying he is not here to judge. This follows through in every verse, one says condemn one says judge.\n \n 2. I don't rightly know with this one. Good point and I will get back to you later.\n \n 3. When God said that a couple getting married became \"one flesh\" did he actually mean that they were to become the same person. When God commands me to to become \"one with Him\", did he actually mean for me to become God, or worse, Him become human. The idea of a \"oneness\" is prevalant throughout the Bible and in no instances does it mean that two seperate objects become one object, it means that they become one in person and spirit. If Jesus and God were the same thing than Christianity is useless in the fact that Jesus WAS human. And if he was anything less or more than Christianity is a lie. If you;ll notice in the preceding lines in John 10:30 verse Jesus speaks on all Christians becoming \"one\" in Him. Does he mean that they all become the same person or entity?

It is so full of facts and watertight arguments, that really lead to evidence, that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior of the world. \n \n Let me tell you a story.... a true story. There was once a lawyer, who wanted to prove that the Bible could not possibly stand up to strong tests. It must fail, or so he thought. He read the whole New Testament through, testing it the whole time, to the best of his human ability. When he had finished, he knew that the Bible was the infallible Word of God. There was no doubt. No test could stand up to the Bible. It broke down everything. He went on to write Ben Hur, the Story of the Christ. \n \n That's all I have to say. I continue to hope that, someday, you will be drawn to Jesus, and believe. He is your Creator, He made you, He knows, and has already determined what will happen to you. It could be that in His will, you will be saved from hell. I hope so.\n \n LovetheSouth",

( I think I spelled that wrong)\n \n \n No, I have not read the Bible, I am in the process of reading it. But I wouldn't exactly call the Bible the most trustworthy of sources. It has a lot of contradictions, and was written in a time of different social and religous taboos, and so must be taken with a grain of salt, or perhaps a few grains. \n \n Supposing, that this is the Gay Marrige thread, I would venture to assume that we are argueing about the Church's view on gay marriges. The United States may have been founded by God fearing people, and one of the first settlements may have been Puritan, but the fact remains that the government is specifically told that it is not a church, and whether gay people will or will not go to Hell in the afterlife, before they are dead the government has not right to tell them whether they can get married or not.",

Therefore, (if we do seomthing else stupid and base our system on religious ideas by having any government influence peoples \"unions\") two men or two women should be able to begranted the same union as a man and a woman.\n \n We should drop the use of the word \"marriage\" from government matters entirely, as it is a religous word. Then, religious groups can form their own form of marrying people which each can decide on their own who deserves this priveledge.\n \n The consideration of how people are unionized or if they are by others, the social view of marriages, is simply up to each person. You should be able to think of other people grouping however you want.\n \n But, all people should be quaranteed equal rights to form a union.\n \n Marriage should be left the the relgious system.",

She is my life. I would do anything for her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. She makes me so happy. She protects me. I protect her. She loves me. I love her. Silences are never awkward - only comfortable. We are in love. We are loyal, kind, loving, considerate and treat each other with so much respect. We defy anyone to upset the other. We crave each other. We are spontaneous. We are very strong as a couple. No one and nothing can stop that. I love her and am in love with her. She loves me and is in love with me. We have the most amazing relationship. IT IS SECOND TO NONE. There are two years age difference between us. She is beautiful. She says I'm quite fit too LOL. I'm proud of her and she is of me. We will swear black is white for each other. We back each other 110%. \n \n Sounds like a damn good relationship... wouldn't you agree? Excuse the short sharp sentences but they are just a tiny few of the feelings that my girlfriend and I feel for each other. Now, should we be allowed to get married? Just by these feelings? Who should be allowed to judge whether or not we marry? What gives them the right to decide? Who gives them the right to decide? \n \n I do have a point that does relate to the original question but please let me see your replies first before I complete my point.

   "emoticon_xbouncer Well, to be honest I thought that this forum was used a little bit more. The point is that when you read my last post you don't actually know which gender I am. I very much doubt that this feelings can be distinguished that easily. So if I am a female does that mean that what I wrote cannot be true because I would then be discussing a same sex 'happy family'? If I am male then there would probably not be many reasons to doubt what I have written BECAUSE as some of you would put IT IS NORMAL.\n \n So, back to my point, If two people are totally commited and happy with each other then I truly believe that they should be allowed to not just marry but to share pensions, be next of kins etc etc. \n \n There is a film available in the UK (I am not sure if it is in America) called \"IF THESE WALLS COULD TALK 2\" it is QUOTE \"an intimate look at the lesbian experience in America in different social and political climates from the sixties to the millennium\" Perhaps this may be worth a viewing by some of you. If any of you have seen this I would like to see your comments and if you haven't and have given reasons as to why gay marriage should NOT be legalised then please watch it and see if it changes your opinion. This is about being open minded. It's about accepting change. LMAO god forbid if 'the gays take over' and make hetrosexual sex illegal!!! or turn some of you into outcasts!!! Hehe only kidding. BUT if you met me in the street and didn't know my sexual preferences you would like me. Then when we became friends could you be the type of friend that suddenly says URGH and doesn't want to see the same person happy? - That would make you very shallow, eventually possibly, very lonely too.\n \n I AM A LESBIAN and very proud of my life. I am happy and wouldn't change any aspect of my life with my girlfriend. How many of you are totally happy in your relationships? How many of you can marry to prove it? I can't marry because some one (and who the hell do they think they are) says I can't. If I have a serious road traffic accident, the one that loves and cares for me is not necessarily going to be the person that gets the telephone call to be by my bed if I die. Then if I die.. Where does my pension go? NOT to who I want it to go to! BUT I pay the same pension as anyone else. AND they have the right!! Is that fair? \n \n Perhaps I am too attached to this particular debate that you are having but if you actually have a sensible argument against gay marriage then please give it your best shot emoticon_xkill here. I look forward to reading your comments. :xbanghead",

   "One who is agnostic has no faith at all; one who is atheistic needs only enough faith to know in his heart that God does not exist. \n\n \n No, that is a fallacious definition of atheism. Atheism means exactly what the word literally says: absence of belief in any god(s).\n \n An atheist does not claim to know that God does not exist, nor does he need to know that any more than he needs to know that wizards or hobbits do not exist.\n \n \nThere is no proof that god exists, thus belief in god is a matter of faith.\n \n \n Obviously. And an atheist is one who does not have that kind of faith.\n \n \nBut a true scientist without any faith would not be an athiest, for a true scientist never assumes anything in his heart. \n\n \n Science and religion deal with different questions. There are no truly religious beliefs that a \"true scientist\" could not hold. (I do not count pseudoscience such as creationism among truly religious beliefs.)\n \n \nTo assume nothing, to have a complete absence of belief and opinion and faith, would make you agnostic, \n\n \n This is multiply wrong.\n \n First, I hope you actually mean \"belief\", \"opinion\" and \"faith\" to refer only to the issue of existence of a supreme being. Of course, both atheists and agnostics can have all 3 of those in other issues, including issues that are religious in essence.\n \n Second, while I respect the choice of individuals who call themselves agnostic, I do not know of any consistent definition of agnosticism that is not a subset of atheism. Of course, there are atheists who are not agnostics, i.e., who claim to actually know that there is no god. But I don't see how one can be an agnostic and at the same time not an atheist. That is logically inconsistent.\n \n Third, if there is such thing as agnosticism that is not atheism, it must by definition involve some degree of belief or faith; if it did not, it would be atheism. Now I am not sure what you mean by \"opinion\" in this context. Perhaps that an agnostic is one who simply has no opinion on matters of belief in god(s)? Well, that is not the standard definition (according to which an agnostic is one who disclaims any knowledge regarding the existence of god(s)), but it may be a pretty accurate description of the practical criterion people use to classify themselves.\n \n \nfor athiesm is the belief that god will never be proven to exist, and we don't know that. \n\n \n Now this is a wrong definition I have not seen before. I have often heard that an atheist is one who positively claims that God does not exist (roughly the \"atheist who is not agnostic\" subset I described above). That is wrong, but it is at least a fairly standard definition of \"strong atheism\" or (more properly) \"antitheism\". Your definition is also wrong, but it is also quite interesting.\n \n The missing piece is the definition of \"god\" that atheists allegedly claim will never be proven to exist.\n \n If it is any particular god defined fairly precisely by the dogmas of a particular religion, then I would be perfectly comfortable saying not only that he will never be proven to exist, but also that I can easily prove that such an entity in fact does not exist.\n \n But if it is just some undefined supreme being, or even the very vaguely defined God of the more liberal Christian denominations and Reformed Judaism, then I would not make any statemens about the prospects of a proof or disproof of His existence; any such statement would be meaningless.",

   "bumping this up.\n\n \n \n Thanks Ladywolf\n \n Actually my mother and I were just talking about the \"defintions\" just the other night. Being My mother, she is all for Gays having the same exact ACCESS to civil rights and couples' protections and any opposite couple. The problem is when the law gets involved with matters of the heart. When emotions are what is the driving force behind a definition of a word, those emotions will manipulate that word to fit the emotions behind it. \n The thing is that the LEGAL contract of which two people apply for is just that, a legal document stating their union will be charged with rights, protections and responcibilities equal to that which is charged to others entering into the same exact contract.\n The idea to bar gays from such a contract is gender descrimination at best. \n \n My partner and I are \"Married\" in the sence that we have an emotional bond with each other. We are \"married\" in the sence that we raise a family together. We are \"married\" in the sence that we share financial burdons as well as profits equally. \n What we do not have are RIGHTS! Rights, protections, recognition and justice. In the LEGAL SENCE~!\n \n What is a marriage? It's an emotional bond between two people who choose to share their lives together and who agree to define their relationship as such. What those two persons to in the privacy of their home is no one's business. How they define their \"marriage\" is up to them as long as neither is endangering the other in anyway. \n What is a LEGAL Marriage? \n That's where we get into the quagmire. \n Legal marriage allows for rights, protections, liberties, responcibilities and recognition of which those who do not have such a legally binding contract are not privy to. \n To deny any Concenting, Adult, human being from that or to regulate which parties are allowed to enter into such a contract, apart from public safety, is an overstepping of the law into every citizen's lives.",

Different religions / religious sects withing the same religion interpret the word \"marriage\" differently. Merely as examples: Southern Baptist may define it as the union between one man and one woman; certain sects of Islam may define it as a union between one man and an indefinate number of women; the Metropolitan Community Church (a Christian denomination) may define it as the union of any two individuals. Please keep in mind that these are \"religious\" interpretations of the word \"marriage\".\n \n One of the cornerstones of the Constitution of the United States of America is freedom of religion and the government's non-imposition of religion. Can we agree on that? If so, feel free to parctice whichever religion you see fit and consider your \"marriage\" under whichever interpretation your choice of religion wishes. If you chose the \"one man, one woman\" religion, so be it. You are free to do so. If you chose the \"one man, indefinate number of women\" religion, so be it. If you chose the \"union of any two individuals\" religion, so be it. Your \"marriage\" will be duly recognized by your particular religion. Or you may chose to not have any religious interpretation at all. So be it. Let us leave the word \"marriage\" as a religious term.\n \n Another cornerstone of the Constitution of the United States of America is equal rights and equal protection under the law for all individuals.\n \n So, here's my proposition:LET'S DO BOTH!!!!!!! Let's preserve religious freedom AND civil rights.\n \n How do we do that? Quite simply: get government out of religion. Instead of passing a constitutional ammendment (as currently proposed) to specifically deny civil rights to a particular group of individuals ( can you imagine that!?!?!?!?! A fundamental change to the constitutional to deny civil rights?? Our founding fathers must be rolling in their graves!!! ). Instead, lets ammend all current federal law to remove any reference to the words \"marriage\", \"marry\" or any derivation thereof and replace it with \"civil union\" or a derivation thereof. \n \n The result?

The APA looks at the symptomology, diagnosis, and treatment of psychiatric disorders. They use something called the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual) to classify disorders. Search for it on the web, you can get a good idea of the number of different disorders there are which relate to pedophilia. But again, it is not their job nor is it their desire to choose sides over these issues, only to identify disorders, and treat them accordingly.

Gates said the relatively high number of gay and lesbian couples getting married probably reflects pent-up demand.\n \n \"You have to remember that same-sex couples haven't had the ability to marry, so you would expect a surge that probably would not be sustained over time as it becomes a much more normalized process,\" Gates said.\n \n In Provincetown and Northampton, same-sex couples made up the majority of people who received marriage licenses in the last six months.\n \n In Provincetown, 912, or 97 percent, of the 937 couples who have applied for licenses since May 17 are same-sex couples. In Northampton, 325, or 66 percent, of the 494 couples who got licenses were gay or lesbian.\n \n In Provincetown, 225 of the same-sex couples applied for licenses during the first week after May 17, and in Northampton 114 did. Other cities and towns also had relatively high percentages of same-sex couples applying: In Somerville 32 percent of the applicants were gay or lesbian couples, and in Springfield the percentage was 12 percent.\"\n \n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=3756\n \n \nGiven that homosexuality is a way of life inseperable from promiscuity and twisted means of sexual gratification, one can't really be surprised that millions of gay people really could care less about marriage, even though they acted as if they did.\n\n \n Given that heterosexuality is a life inseperable from lack of comitment, promiscuity and twisted means of sexual gratification, one shouldn't be surprised that there is such a high heterosexual divorce rate.",

Just in time too, a new year starts soon.\n \n How about this one jyoshu:\n \n Given that religion is a way of life inseperable from ignorance and irrational beliefs and behaviors....\n \n #1 being homosexual does not lead to promiscuity. \n #2 Promiscuity is a personal choice, there is no justification for legislating against what consenting adults do with one another and how frequently.\n #3 It sounds, yet again, like you're trying to tell people what is and is not right, based on religion (which is absurd).\n If promiscuity were linked, inseperably (which it's not), to sexual gratification......\n \n so what? What do you choose...religious gratification? That's somehow better? Nonsense. \n \n http://www.dearpeggy.com/affairs.html\n Conservative estimates are that 60 percent of men and 40 percent of women will have an extramarital affair. These figures are even more significant when we consider the total number of marriages involved-since it's unlikely that all the men and women having affairs happen to be married to each other. If even half of the women having affairs (or 20 percent) are married to men not included in the 60 percent having affairs, then at least one partner will have an affair in approximately 80 percent of all marriages.  \n \n Looks like hetero marriage and faithfulness don't go hand and hand either.\n \n -Mach",
