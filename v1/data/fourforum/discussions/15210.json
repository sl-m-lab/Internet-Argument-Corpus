   "How Ignorant Are Americans? - Newsweek\n \n \nThey're the sort of scores that drive high-school history teachers to drink. When NEWSWEEK recently asked 1,000 U.S. citizens to take America's official citizenship test, 29 percent couldn't name the vice president. Seventy-three percent couldn't correctly say why we fought the Cold War. Forty-four percent were unable to define the Bill of Rights. And 6 percent couldn't even circle Independence Day on a calendar.\n\n \n Wow. That is more than a little pathetic. \n \n And this has some pretty serious ramifications. They give a good example in the article:\n \n \nThe current conflict over government spending illustrates the new dangers of ignorance. Every economist knows how to deal with the debt: cost-saving reforms to big-ticket entitlement programs; cuts to our bloated defense budget; and (if growth remains slow) tax reforms designed to refill our depleted revenue coffers. But poll after poll shows that voters have no clue what the budget actually looks like. A 2010 World Public Opinion survey found that Americans want to tackle deficits by cutting foreign aid from what they believe is the current level (27 percent of the budget) to a more prudent 13 percent. The real number is under 1 percent. A Jan. 25 CNN poll, meanwhile, discovered that even though 71 percent of voters want smaller government, vast majorities oppose cuts to Medicare (81 percent), Social Security (78 percent), and Medicaid (70 percent). Instead, they prefer to slash waste-a category that, in their fantasy world, seems to include 50 percent of spending, according to a 2009 Gallup poll.\n \n Needless to say, it's impossible to balance the budget by listening to these people. But politicians pander to them anyway, and even encourage their misapprehensions. As a result, we're now arguing over short-term spending cuts that would cost up to 700,000 government jobs, imperiling the shaky recovery and impairing our ability to compete globally, while doing nothing to tackle the long-term fiscal challenges that threaten ... our ability to compete globally.\n \n\n \n Here is the quiz for those who are interested:\n \n Take the Quiz: What We Don't Know - Newsweek\n \n I missed one. Where they asked what kind of economic system we use in this country I knew they were looking for \"capitalism\", but that answer is wrong. We have a fascist economic system. \n \n 81% could not name a power of the federal government (there are only 4 of them)? That explains a lot. \n \n I cant help but wonder if the 73% who did not know what the cold war was for thought it was a war over global warming????",

   "Most 'ordinary' people dont want the burden of knowledge.\n I dont think Americans are any more ignorant than any other nation.\n\n \n From the article:\n \n \nTo appreciate the risks involved, it's important to understand where American ignorance comes from. In March 2009, the European Journal of Communication asked citizens of Britain, Denmark, Finland, and the U.S. to answer questions on international affairs. The Europeans clobbered us. Sixty-eight percent of Danes, 75 percent of Brits, and 76 percent of Finns could, for example, identify the Taliban, but only 58 percent of Americans managed to do the same-even though we've led the charge in Afghanistan. It was only the latest in a series of polls that have shown us lagging behind our First World peers.\n\n \n Sorry....looks like Americans are, indeed, more ignorant than those in other nations. \n \n The article DOES note that if they focus only on well-off, native born respondents the US actually holds its own against Europe. We can assume that it is the \"well-off\" that makes the difference since the non native born respondents already had to pass this test. \n \n I think this is why nitwits like Palin find a following. People dont want to have to deal with the fact that we live in a complex world, and a lot of the issues we have to deal with on a national level are complex issues. You get somebody like palin with her folksy, simple answers and it appeals to some people. The fact that her simple answers to complex problems are completely ignorant and nonsensical does not seem to matter...the people can get their heads around them without having to actually THINK or KNOW ANYTHING so they are willing to go with it.",

   "I'm am surprised that there is such a difference between Europeans and Americans.\n I know so many Brits that think 'they' ought to do something about 'it' without being at all clear who 'they' are and what 'it' is.\n \n \n How would you compare Ms Palin with Ronald Reagan?\n He was seen as a simpleton ( at least in the UK) before he was elected but his simple folksy style seemed to work.\n Hes seen as a bit of an icon in the States now,I believe\n\n \n Yes and no. Most intelligent people have come to recognize Reagan for the trainwreck that he was. His economic theories have been completely and totally disproved and are dismissed by all but the scarily ignorant as a bad joke. The arms race turned out to pretty much be a steaming pile of Reaganesque fantasy...it turned out we were the only ones running it, and at enormous cost. And as far as most of his foreign policy, like training the taliban to take down a superpower in an attempt to annoy the soviets...yea...we have all seen how well that has worked out. \n \n It was not that long ago that Dick Cheney said \"reagan showed us that deficits dont matter\". At the time a lot of americans smiled and nodded. Today, depending on whose polls you like, anywhere from 80-95% of americans consider our deficit to be an urgent matter.\n \n Reagan did well with his folksy attitude. Palin does not do nearly so well because while americans are apparently mind numbingly ignorant, they have seemed to figure out that our problems are complex, and simple answers will not suffice. \n \n One thing I have found interesting is that it seems like most...in fact almost ALL...Americans seem to feel that there is something DEEPLY wrong with our country. A lot of them cannot even articulate exactly what it is, but they will tell you \"Something is VERY WRONG here\". Personally I think that explains some polls we have seen in the last few years. For example, 80% of americans opposed the wall street bailout EVEN IF IT DESTROYED OUR ECONOMY. Recently there have been a lot of polls about raising our debt ceiling and Americans are opposed to it by a wide margin, even if it destroys our economy and/or government.\n \n I hate to say it, but I am with them. This place is completely screwed up. Burn it down and we can see what we can build in its place. The problems we face are too complex and too fundamental. It is not worth it to save a fascist state.

Fix that and then we can worry about the other stuff. If we DONT fix it, none of the other stuff will matter one bit. There are other issues that I generally care about, but when it comes to the economy right now we are absolutely on the brink.

The next 12 months will decide if there even IS an america for my children to grow up in, and if there IS whether it is the worlds largest third world country.",

It seems like most Americans I know really, truly believe that pretty much no matter what the government does, it is going to screw them personally.
