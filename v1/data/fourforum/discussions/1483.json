   "I love these types of threads. Trying to predict the future and all even if it really isn't all that likely that any of our predications will come to pass. Anyways, here is a list of my predictions.\n \n China and the US will engage in a cold war after China takes control of Taiwan. China will have to revert back to communism as much of the globalized world will place sanctions against them after the invasion of Taiwan. North Korea will collapse and merge with China after the US cuts all aid to the country. South Korea will become similar to Japan in their support for the US and will allow the US to place bases in the region. That country will be the focus of the entire world as China and the US sit at the edge of an all out war. China will face a collapse similar to the Soviet Union but will not go down as quietly. The first nuclear war breaks out between China and the US and their allies. Soon after China breaks up into many separate countries as rebellions for Tibet and Taiwan lead to the collapse of the Chinese government.\n \n Canada stands as one of the few western nations uneffected by the war and eventually becomes one of the few sources of clean water in the entire world. This leads to them becoming a superpower and they begin by helping to rebuild much of the US.\n \n Arab countries rally around a comparitively technologically advanced Egypt to form their own superpower block. With much of Africa, Europe, and Asia now in ruins the arab states begin to expand while Canada and the remaining Western states starve for oil. WWIV breaks out between the two powers in a fight to control the oil reserves. Inefficient and expensive forms of alternative energy are utilized out of sheer necessity by the western powers allowing them to carry out much of the war and defeat the arab nations.\n \n Canada's military becomes unmatched throughout the world after the US and Canada become one nation. So 50 years from now after 2 more world wars, peace is again assured with the existance of the unlikely superpower of Canada.",

   "O.k., in fifity years the world, barring an amazing breakthrough in agriculture and energy production, will be overpopulated and starving. America will be slowly dying as its super-high paid workers go on strike across the board as the world struggles to keep the masses feed. China quickly declares martial law and consripts most of its able population. The Chinese take over most of Asia, and then India follows suit. China and India declare war in about 2069 and most of the fighting is concentrated on the Tibetian Plateau. In 2074 India is agiasnt the wall, they have been boxed in by the suicidial chinese forces and know the chinese will stop at nothing to get their farmland. Meanwhile in the western world the goverment has been overthrown and the populace has gone into a kind of mob-divided, Mad max rule, with few goverment laws inforced. \n \n After 20 years of fighting, India launchs tactical nukes agiasnt China, the Chinese, not expecting this, are caught off gaurd. The war continues, though with 50 million less chinese soldiers. \n \n The year is 2089 and the world has completley come apart. The Marsion Coloneys have been abandoned, the moon launching station now houses a vacumm. the world no longer has countires, except reminates of the Indian and Chinese armies who are still fighting one another. \n \n IN 2095 the very final american president orders all the remaining nuclear missles in america be used to thin the population. this genocidal campgian is aloud to continue because of the lack of any other real threat, and billions die. \n \n Three full years after the nuclear winter ended, the world is a mix of barrien wastelands, and radiation. Most of the Human race was killed and surprisingly two factions form, and begin to fight over ownership of Australia(the area lest effected by the nukes). Eventually one pervails and form the basis for the new world.\n \n This is generally what is going to happen in the next fifty-to-one hundred years if changes aren't made. the players wil be diffrent, and events may not happen the same, but humanity is about to go through a dramatic change if we don't stopped it. And trust me, we won't have a population of 6 billion for long if we let this change take place.",

   "Draconis, your excessively bleak future outlook is unfounded. The theory that we will run out of food doesn't make sense as there is more than enough food in the world to feed everyone as it stands today and it will remain that way. The reason there is hunger is because of poor distribution in some nations. The US, Europe, China, and India shouldn't have to deal with the masses starving unless their governments/system break down. They are all efficient enough to be able to coordinate and feed their people. Also note that the powers of the world are actually decreasing in population growth and if this trend continues their populations will actually begin to fall all over the world. In short the 1st world countries shouldn't have to worry about running out of food anytime soon.\n \n Furthermore the China v India theory probably wouldn't stand up. Russia has too many nukes to allow China or India to take them just as Japan has too many allies to fall without starting a world war. Pakistan and India would have a massive nuclear war if they ever had to do battle ending any hope that either could ever take over much after that war ended. MAD is enough to stop any one country from taking over a bunch of other countries ever again. Considering globalization as well, China and India would suffer economically if they wished to expand as they would be shunned by the West politically and economically.\n \n The worst part of your prediction is the part where the US nukes themselves to drop their population. That is just stupid for many reasons not least of which is the fact that the government could impose a Chinese type law stating that families are limited to the amount of children they can have. If anything like that was actually enforced population growth could be brought to a steep decline over a matter of 20-25 years.\n \n \"This is generally what is going to happen in the next fifty-to-one hundred years if changes aren't made\"\n \n Who exactly says that this is what is likely to happen other than yourself? Who says it is likely that nukes will be used purposely as population control? That is stupidity! It is far more believable that we will destroy this planet in a nuclear war or with a new weapon that we develop and don't fully understand or that a new virus withers our numbers. Starvation is possible but based on the current trend we are able to make far more food than we have ever been able to make before and our population growth is slowing. I don't buy into your predictions at all much less believe that prediction is what is generally accepted as what will happen in the next 50-100 years.",
