What he is saying here is that we just have not seen it yet. This is also part of Bernankes \"soft landing\" bs. He sat in front of congress not long ago and said that the economy had absorbed the housing slump well and he did not think it would be a problem. here is Greenspan saying \"we have not even seen it yet\".\n \n Anybody who has studied economics already knew that Bernake was just blowing hot air when he said that. Single sector slowdowns like we are seeing in the housing market typically take 4-6 quarters to spill over into the wider economy. This is because most purchasing done in large quantities (the purchasing that REALLY matters) is typically done on contract, not on a cash and carry basis. The effect of prices fluctuations and slowdows does not become apparent until current contracts have expired. \n \n In many areas, like unemployment spillover, construction is especially problematic because traditionaly construction companies will pare hours company wide before they will start laying people off. This keeps unemployment numbers steady, but drives down payroll figures, which also does not become apparent as a pattern until several months later.\n \n I bet Bernanke is FURIOUS with greenspan right now. He already has some SERIOUS credibility problems when it comes to his role as an inflation fighter. Now he has Greenspan, who is still respected (probably more then Helicopter Ben) getting up and making these blunt public comments that directyl contradict Bernankes BS. \n \n On the other hand, I guess Bernanke now knows how Greenspan felt when Volker would open his mouth....like following the dot com crash when Volker warned that pumping excess liquidity into the market would just lead to an even bigger equity bubble in the real estate market.",
