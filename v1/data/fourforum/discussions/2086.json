   "On June 31 the United States must be willing to turn the governing of Iraq over to the United Nations who will help install a temporary Iraqi Commission to start-up and run day-to-day government operations. A three state one nation is the most logical solution to Iraq for political, social and geographic reasons. The United Nations and the Iraqi Commission should first focus on forming local government in the villages and cities. At the same time the details to the form of the three state governments will be finalized with local governments selecting temporary state representatives until the next state election. After the first three state Iraqi elections the state officials will appoint the first representatives to Iraq?s national government. \n \n The United Nations will have two major and separate roles. With the first being the overseeing of the Iraqi Commission and the second part coordinating the NGO?s and foreign governments humanitarian aid to Iraq. The United States and NATO will help supply security to the Green Zones that will be created for the NGO?s and international humanitarian workers. They will also help train the new local police, security forces and Iraqi National-guard. \n \n Iraq having more fresh water, fertile land and oil than any other Arab nation is in a unique situation. Developing Iraq?s natural resources with the engineering knowledge of the twenty-first century. Farming Middle Eastern specialty crops and livestock creating jobs and businesses for the Iraqi people. Only by developing a large and independent private sector will there be stability in the Iraqi society. With many of the International NGO?s working with the Iraqi people to develop cottage industries throughout the Iraqi society. Starting at the local level will help the most families the fastest. \n \n By developing the state and local platform rule of laws first will help the nation of Iraq develop a balance and trusted national government latter. The method of operations between the leader of cities and villages around the world does not very too much from on nation to another. The same could not be said about the federal government systems and priorities one nation to another. \n \n To help defer some of the United Nations and NGO?s humanitarian expenses an off shore oil zone will be created running along the Kuwait border in Iraq. The League of Arab Nations will over see the United Nations in this operation as a way to help support humanitarian work in Iraq and other Middle Eastern nations over a long period of time. Bringing the Iraqi conditions back to a normal state with people working in a peaceful society without an obvious foreign military presents. Letting the seeds of opportunity grow in the fertile land of Iraq society. Let us not re-create what the Israeli have created in Palestine and show them the way to peace.",

   "Even briefer outline:\n \n Pack up your soldiers + tanks and leave. Should take a month tops.\n\n Unless our leaders are willing to annihilate the Muslim populace. If they do that then we can develop Iraq into a modern-day country. We can install democracy and teach those few that are alive how to become one nation under God, like we are. We can also show them how to use toilet paper, how to install water and sewer lines. Now, they have pumper trucks hauling sewage out of the beautiful city of Baghdad and spraying it in and on the outlying areas. Oh, and never try to shake hands left-handed until this is implemented&#8230;it is an insult to them since they do not use toilet tissue, but a bare left hand to clean themselves after a fecal session.\n Right now, as we speak, there are many Muslims working with our military and our civilian contractors to restore areas destroyed, both in the recent battles and from older, interwar barrages. But, these nonconformists that are helping us get killed by their fellow Muslim &#8220;brothers&#8221; for trying to rebuild the country, so, hey, what&#8217;s the Big Cheese?\n So, unless we are willing to commit mass genocide, we are there, doing just what we are doing now, forever.\n \n Side note: The Hajjis (I don&#8217;t really know why they are called this) that want to get along with our people get harassed daily, their money stolen, and are sometimes wounded and killed by a fellow that was a Hajji last week. Religion will win, not politics &#8211; unless you want to settle for the appearance that it is.",

I just can&#8217;t believe everyone of those tales. But, by the same token, I can&#8217;t believe all that I have heard from journeyman that I have talked to that have returned. I can say this with all confidence: The Iraqi people, for the most part, hate our guts and liver&#8230;literally. I have only talked to eleven people that have returned. Of the 11, 9 says the same thing that I have learned from other reports on TV, magazines, new articles in that we are playing the wrong hand. One guy thinks we should be there, but he was never in the thick of things, just a gopher that sat on his haunches in a motel; the other guy was unsure. Seven of the nine have seen bloodshed, the gruesome kind, body-exploding stuff.

   "Why should we pack up? What would that accomplish? \"Our soldiers will be home where the won't get killed\". True, but then soldiers (especially the Marines) live for the fight. How many people have you talked to that have been to Iraq, killed a man? How many of these soldiers who you care so deeply about have you interviewed found their opinion on the situation they're in. I've talked to a couple I can honestly say, and they want to be there, they feel they have a purpose. I don't understand why everybody is whining about our soldiers being over there when it has no positive effect whatsoever. How can this make anything better for our troops who are the ones who have to pick up the guns, when they know the country the love is doing nothing but b**** about what they're doing. \n \n Should we be over there? Well, that's another debate and another thread. Should we leave, that's the question. My answer is no, because withdrawal will do nothing but confirm that we aren't committed. We leave now, can the free Iraq defend itself from the would be despots and war lords? Yes, but only if you're dellusional. We could leave it up to UN troops, but then again, they don't exactly have a resume you can be confident in. Isn't there a saying that if you want something done right, then you got to do it yourself? I agree that the UN should play some part the rebuilding of Iraq, but please, let the big boys be the ones who do the fighting.",

YOu have 3 different ethnic groups at each others throats all the time, all plotting how they can most effectively do away with the others and sieze power.

He needed a military of 400,000 and a secret police force of 15,000 to control the country and keep the various groups from killing each other off in an attempt to seize power.\n \n I realsie this is a foreign concept for Americans, mostly because we have not been a country long enough to have had any long running anamosity towards any otehr nation or group of people. 250 years is nothing when compared tot helength of time you are talking about the dispute between the kurds, the shia and the sunni.\n \n \nYes, in perspective, the hardest part is more than likely over, with only groups of renegades and insurgents left to cause trouble and take lives. We aren't the UN; we don't leave just because we're in harms way. \n \n \n \n Obviously not, the UN would not have illegally invaded. THe easy part is now over, the hard part is just beginning. Over running the Iraqi army was nothing. They had poor equipment, were not well trained, and were not well supplied. We hit them from the air, and hit them from long range. It was shooting fish in a barrel. Now we have to deal with an enemy that is interspersed with the general population, fairly well armed, fairly well organised, and operating in an environment where they enjoy wide spread support of the population at large. \n \n By contrast, the US military has shown itself to be ill equipped to deal with an urban combat situation. They are operating in an environment they are not familiar with, dealing with people who don't speak their language, and they do not enjoy popular support. Unfortunatly, from the start, the American media has backed the Bush administrations fantasy of widespread support from the Iraqi people and has modeled their reports to lead the American people to believe the lies we have been told. A good example is the video of the Americans being killed in falluja. The us media showed a 2 or 3 minut clip of close angle shots. I watched the same footage on al-jazeera in its entirety (roughly 25 minutes). There were HUNDREDS of IRaqis in the street yelling \"death to America\" and tearing those guys to pieces. Even by the Bush administrations accounting, this was a spontaneous riot. Hundreds of people took to the streets in a matter of minutes. People who were so passionate about hteir cause that they not only killed, but desecrated the bodies of those guys.\n \n Sadar has been around for years, and while he makes a convenient scape goat, he has NEVER had the kind of power or influence they are now attributing to him. He is a minor Shia cleric. Under saddam, he was nothing at all. He has no money, a limited number of loyal followers, and that is it. \n \n I know a few people in IRaq (Iraqis) one of whom I happen to know has been orchastrating attacks on the American troops there. His wife and three daughters were killed by an American cruise missile and he is more than a little miffed. He is in Baghdad, where they have phone service, and even internet service part of the time, and he had absolutly no idea who sadar was when I last communicated with him (4 days ago).\n \n \nWe are America, and we stick things out to the end.

How long do you think it takes for a country to build an army, to learn the art of soldiering and use it effectively? \n \n \n In the case of the Iraqis, where every man of military age has recieved some military training, not very long.

There is no \"Creating a New Democracy for Dummies\" book out there. If something is worth doing, then do it right. Write the check, please. Spoken like a true liberal.\n\n \n Actually I am a die hard conservative. I think that if you invade another country on a false premise, destroy their industrial infrastructure, kill thousands of civilians, and shell their cities, you owe them something. And forcing your government down their throat is not my idea of payment. They don't want our government, they don't want our help, they don't want our troops traipsing around their country. They sure as hell don't want the permanent military bases we ar building there. I am sure they would take our money, though. \n \n Odds are we will repay the blood spilled ten fold over the next several years as the hundreds, if not thousands of new terrorists we have created during the course of this fiasco get organised an launch attacks on our civilian population, especially since the ill will we have fostered with so much of the rest of the world gives the terrorists more places to hide than ever. We should at least pay them for the buildings we blew up.",

Yes, there are different parties trying to gain all of the power, but there are parties here doing the same thing with different groups and organizations all scrambling for their piece of the pie (granted, not with an AK-47). All they have known is dictatorship, extreme rule with the gun, and I'm almost positive it takes more than a year to overcome that. \n \n \nI realsie this is a foreign concept for Americans, mostly because we have not been a country long enough to have had any long running anamosity towards any otehr nation or group of people. 250 years is nothing when compared tot helength of time you are talking about the dispute between the kurds, the shia and the sunni. \n\n \n It is, but then what do we do about that? Leave them to slaughter each other because that's the way it's always been? Why should they live in a barbaric society, when there is something better for them? Do you understand it, being an American?\n \n \n Obviously not, the UN would not have illegally invaded. THe easy part is now over, the hard part is just beginning.

On what assumption do you make that? Because we haven't foudn weapons yet? I refuse to believe that Sadaam was clean as a whistle and he wouldn't let us inspect for other reasons. Men are never truly innocent, especially those with the mentality of Sadaam. Even if weapons were found during an inspection, the UN would have done nothing and in the unlikely case that they did, would have cut and run at the first sign of serious trouble. We did bomb and we did commence air strikes but that was only the beginning. Our army moved through Iraq and took out anything in its path to Baghdad. And I'd like to point out a few things. One, the enemy now is nothing more than a group of cowards hiding behind women and children and taking refuge in holy places in a futile attempt that we won't kill them there. If the Iraqi army is gone, then who are we fighting now? Those who want to take the power, and who fear the US less than Sadaam. Two, the general populance does not hate us. Where do you get this information? I've talked to actual SOLDIERS who have been over there, and they still communicate with those over there, and from that I know that the general public is glad we are there. Furthermore, these same soldiers are disgusted at how the media is skewing the picture of what is really going on. \n \n \nBy contrast, the US military has shown itself to be ill equipped to deal with an urban combat situation. They are operating in an environment they are not familiar with, dealing with people who don't speak their language, and they do not enjoy popular support.

People who were so passionate about hteir cause that they not only killed, but desecrated the bodies of those guys.\n\n \n Ill equipped? Do you even know what military you're speaking of? The US military is the best trained in the world, and they can adapt to any situation, especially any special forces teams. This I know for a FACT. If you're getting at the losses in life, they are nothing. This is not Vietnam, we are not be slaughtered. We could go in and perserve the lives of our troops more effectively by having no regard for the surroundings and fight battles which left nothing but rubble in the place of cities, but we're not about that. And I don't trust Al jazeera, so I'm not going to take their word on all Iraqis hating the US. And I like the little spin on the end of this to make it seem as though they were just and civil. \"Passionate about their cause\"... HA! Those are nothing more than rats going for the wounded.\n \n \n \n I know a few people in IRaq (Iraqis) one of whom I happen to know has been orchastrating attacks on the American troops there. His wife and three daughters were killed by an American cruise missile and he is more than a little miffed. He is in Baghdad, where they have phone service, and even internet service part of the time, and he had absolutly no idea who sadar was when I last communicated with him (4 days ago). \n\n \n You know somebody who is taking it upon themself to kill American soldiers...? Wow, either you're full of BS (which for you're sake I hope so) or you're somebody the military should have a sit down discussion with.\n \n \n In the case of the Iraqis, where every man of military age has recieved some military training, not very long. They seem to be making a fine account of themselves against us. You are right, though, we are America, and we will keep making hte same mistakes until we are forced to stop. \n\n \n Knowing how to fire a automatic weapon is not considered military training.\n \n I was going to continue this argument and prove my point even further, but seeing as I now know the sort of person you are, there's really no point. And I sincerly do hope that you're lying about knowing and having discussions with the enemy. But if you're not, forgive me for not having any remorse when a SAW gunner turns his insides into porridge for the vultures to feast on. As for the bloodshed ten fold, illegitimacy and all of that pile, there's no substance to it. We make mistakes, but then again we are learning from them and taking steps to making sure they do not happen again. What are these mistakes that we are making that should force us to stop? Really, do you have anything? Your slanted view of the reality of this war (do you really think they stand a chance against us?) is almost comical to be quite honest. Please excuse me while I have more faith in the country I love, the military that fights for it, and those who serve than someone like you. Thank you.",

   "As long as we need to until the area is secure and the Iraqi military is effective and well trained. Yes, there are different parties trying to gain all of the power, but there are parties here doing the same thing with different groups and organizations all scrambling for their piece of the pie (granted, not with an AK-47). All they have known is dictatorship, extreme rule with the gun, and I'm almost positive it takes more than a year to overcome that. \n\n \n IRaq will never see securty while under seige by US troops. It is just not going to happen.\n \n \nIt is, but then what do we do about that? Leave them to slaughter each other because that's the way it's always been? Why should they live in a barbaric society, when there is something better for them? Do you understand it, being an American?\n\n \n No, we let them elect the government they want, from the pool of canidates that they designate, then we draw our troops back and let THEM run THEIR country.\n \n \n \nIllegally invaded? On what assumption do you make that? Because we haven't foudn weapons yet? I refuse to believe that Sadaam was clean as a whistle and he wouldn't let us inspect for other reasons. Men are never truly innocent, especially those with the mentality of Sadaam. Even if weapons were found during an inspection, the UN would have done nothing and in the unlikely case that they did, would have cut and run at the first sign of serious trouble.\n \n \n NO, the UN inspected for years, found no viable production facilities and nothing but dismantled/decomissioned carriers (munitions). Before we went to war, the UN inspectors requested 2 more weeks to finish their inspections. There were three more facilities they wished to inspect before tendering their final report. None of those 3 were suspected production facilities, all three were psooible storage facilites. Kays team already inspected those facilities and declared them clean. \n \n If saddam actually had the WMD's, he owuld have used them. We stated before we went in that our objective was to completely take Iraq and oust saddam. He had nothing to loose by using chem or bio weapons, they were the only real chance he had. He has already demonstrated that he is willing to se them, he was just not ready or able.\n \n \nWe did bomb and we did commence air strikes but that was only the beginning. Our army moved through Iraq and took out anything in its path to Baghdad. \n \n \n Wrong. We had close ari support and strategic strikes right up until the end.\n \n \nAnd I'd like to point out a few things. One, the enemy now is nothing more than a group of cowards hiding behind women and children and taking refuge in holy places in a futile attempt that we won't kill them there. If the Iraqi army is gone, then who are we fighting now? Those who want to take the power, and who fear the US less than Sadaam. \n \n \n They are called \"guerilla fighters\" this is how smart people combat a vastly superior force. We are fighting Iraqi citizens who have banded together agais the US forces. For some reason, people have trouble understanding that when you kill 10,000 civilains invading, there is going to be backlash. Those folks all had relatives and friends who are ticked.\n \n \nTwo, the general populance does not hate us. Where do you get this information? I've talked to actual SOLDIERS who have been over there, and they still communicate with those over there, and from that I know that the general public is glad we are there. Furthermore, these same soldiers are disgusted at how the media is skewing the picture of what is really going on. \n \n \n ANd I have talked to actual Iraqis over there. You are talking about people who for years have lived under a governmet that killed you for dissent. People who have spoken out against the Americans have been dragged off to prison as \"suspected insurgents\" and detained (And apparently tortured). These people do waht people all over the world do in such a situation. They smile at the invaders, then go home and polish their AK. This is how guerillas function, this is how guerillas have ALWAYS functioned.\n \n \nIll equipped? Do you even know what military you're speaking of? The US military is the best trained in the world, and they can adapt to any situation, especially any special forces teams. This I know for a FACT. If you're getting at the losses in life, they are nothing. This is not Vietnam, we are not be slaughtered. We could go in and perserve the lives of our troops more effectively by having no regard for the surroundings and fight battles which left nothing but rubble in the place of cities, but we're not about that. \n \n \n The best military in the world when it comes to urban combat is the british, due to their experiences during the irish conflict. Even the US commanders in Iraq have said this when they assigned the british troops to take basra, after an urban combat situation broke out there at the beginning of the invasion. Your average American soldier get ONE DAY devoted to urban combat during basic.\n \n You need a whole different set of tactics and weapoins for urban combat than for standard military combat. When fighting in an urban envirnment, a standard M16 is a poor choice of weapon. You need to be able to acquire your target quickly, you want to fire a heavier bullet if possible (even if it does mean a slower round). A sub machine gun (automatic or burst weapon that fires a pistol cartrige) is a much better choice. THe military has finnaly caught on tho this and is issuing SBR (short barrels) versions of the M-16 with a collapsible stock. The big question is, will they be able to get the guys armed with them quickly enought to make a differenceYou want to keep your men on foot and mobile, as a vehicle is easy to trap, then you just launch RPGs or toss grenades at it until you penetrate the armor (Assuming it is armored).\n \n YOu also want to keep your guys in squad sized groups and seperate them if possible. THis is because in an urban combat environment you have far more cover available and it is incredibly easy to get flanked during a fire fight. YOu want to be able to call in other guys to flank the force that has flanked you, otherwise you are dead. Finally, you want a few heavy columns (heavy in manpower, not armor) on the outskirts of the city. These are usually called a rapid response force. They are for when you get in enough hot water that you cannot hope to extricate yourself. \n \n The closest I can come to a comparison of the situation is Falluja is the seige at freetown (sierra leone). Rebels moved into a part of the city and clamped down on it. It took 600 battle hardened mercenaries supported by 40,000 ecomog troops doing a room by room search of the entire city to root out the rebels.\n \n I am not saying the Army is a bunch of bafoons. They are simply not generally well trained (with the exception of some special forces units) or well equiped for urban combat. We did learn some lessons from somalia and our experiences in Bosnia and the standard loadout was changed a little and the idea of issuing SBRs was considered (some lucky guys even got them). Right now, we are simply trying to contain the problems in the city. We are not using mobile forces there, our guys are hunkerd down in secure locations. This will not regain the city.\n \n \nAnd I don't trust Al jazeera, so I'm not going to take their word on all Iraqis hating the US. And I like the little spin on the end of this to make it seem as though they were just and civil. \"Passionate about their cause\"... HA! Those are nothing more than rats going for the wounded.\n \n \n \n I would like to remind you (though most don't like to be reminded) that these are the same folks that Bush personally commended for their unbiased reporting during the war in Afghanistan. I have challenged many people to show me a story by Al JAzeera that is factually inacurate. None have managed to do so. Besides, I am not talking about anything that requires any faith in their reporting. THEY SHOWED THE VIDEO. You got to see it with your own eyes. Whether I trust them or not, I trust my eyes. \n \n They are passionate about their cause. Bin Laden is passionate about his cause. BEing passionate about your cause does not say anything about the civility of the cause or the methods employed. \n \n \nYou know somebody who is taking it upon themself to kill American soldiers...? Wow, either you're full of BS (which for you're sake I hope so) or you're somebody the military should have a sit down discussion with.\n\n \n I already passed it along to intel. I decided it was a no win situation. I don't want to see US soldiers killed, and I don't want to see my buddy killed. I decided it would be much better if he was sitting safely in a prison until the whole mess is over. Of course, that is before we got confirmation for some of the hundreds of cases of torture that have been reported. HE is probably better off there anyway (assuming they can catch him).\n \n \nKnowing how to fire a automatic weapon is not considered military training.\n\n \n Pretty much. What all do you think a private in the US military knows how to do ? THey know how to follow orders and operate their equipment. Higher ups make decisions and devise tactics. \n \n \nI was going to continue this argument and prove my point even further, but seeing as I now know the sort of person you are, there's really no point. And I sincerly do hope that you're lying about knowing and having discussions with the enemy. But if you're not, forgive me for not having any remorse when a SAW gunner turns his insides into porridge for the vultures to feast on. \n \n \n So far, you have proven that your knowledge of what is going on within the ranks of the Iraqi people come from talking to US soldiers, who most likely do not speak the same language as those Iraqis. You have also proved an ignorance when it comes to urban combat tactics. You have also managed to prove rather nicely that your world view comes from the US media. Personally, I think that if you are trying to figure out what is going on in other parts of the world, local media is a better option. Sure, they have a different spin and a different take on what is going on, you just have to be smart enought to seperate the propoganda from the news. \n \n If he gets killed before he gets caught, I won't feel sorry for him either. I rarely feel sorry when volunteer soldiers get killed in a combat zone. They are there because they chose to be. If they get killed, it is because that is the risk they chose to take.\n \n \nAs for the bloodshed ten fold, illegitimacy and all of that pile, there's no substance to it. We make mistakes, but then again we are learning from them and taking steps to making sure they do not happen again. What are these mistakes that we are making that should force us to stop? Really, do you have anything? Your slanted view of the reality of this war (do you really think they stand a chance against us?) is almost comical to be quite honest. Please excuse me while I have more faith in the country I love, the military that fights for it, and those who serve than someone like you. Thank you.\n\n \n Your faith is great. Now, can you give me one historical example of a single time in all of history that terrorist have been beaten except by compromise? It has never happened. NOt once, not one single time, EVER in the historyof the world has a terrorist group actually been destroyed through military action or intelligence. Terrorism is a nasty business. You are dealing with an enemy that is not well defined and is interspersed with a civilian population. It is simple impossible to defend your entire country against terrorism. THis is not a failing of the US, this is just one of the problems with terrorism. YOu cannot fight an actual \"war\" against terroism, becasue there is no army for you to fight, and they hide in the shadows and hit your civiians when you are not looking. We have apparently foiled some attacks. THat is great. Right now, we probably still have some viable informants within the various terrorist groups. WE are already starting to see Al Queda closing its ranks and vetting its membership to plug these leaks. We can expect them to be much more tight lipped and much more selective when it comes to their membership. THe days f walking up and saying \"I want to join up\" are over.\n \n While you are trying to think of a single tiem when terrorists have been beaten purely by force, you can perhapse think of a time when America has prevailed in a guerilla war. That is something else that has never happened. This is another one of those \"problem most likely made worse by the solution\". In the case of guerilla warfare, you are talking once again about an enemy that is interpspesed witht he civilian population. THe big difference between these folks and the terrorist are that they are almost always fighting on their home ground and always have the support of the civilain population. WIthout support of the local population, guerilla fighters could not survive there for any length of time because they would have no where to hide and would have no means of resupply. THe problem is, you kill one, you create 2. You kill a civilain while going after the guerillas, you create 4 more guerillas. This is why they keep talking about \"winning the hearts and minds\". This is how you can beat guerillas.\n \n We could probably do it also if we had enough troops in Iraq, but I don;t think the American public is willing to suppy the extra 200,000 troops we would need (this is just my opinion, I was debating this with a retired Army general the other day who thinks we need 300,000 more troops). Considering we only have 500,000 combat troops, that means effectively assigning over half our combat troops to Iraq (And that is if you use my more conservative number). We don't have enough men to do this, especially since we still have troops in Afghanistan (and need more there), Korea (where we beat the tar out of the guerillas, right?), Bosnia (another place we are still fighting guerillas). We just don't have the manpower.\n \n I am glad you have faith in the US military and its abilities in this area. Having seen urban combat more than once, I personally doubt their tactics. KNowing several officers in the US military, and being VERY familiar with the standard training, loadout and being familiar with the standard weaponry issued to US troops, I will stick with my opinion that we are not well suited for urban combat. HAving studied history and politcs fairly extensively (especially the history of politics) I will also stick to my guns when it comes to guerilla warfare and terrorism.",

   "1. iraq had fired on our jets numerous times, breaking his treaty with us giving us every right to go in\n\n \n The only time we had the right to fly over Iraq was in enforcing the no fly zones. We were never fired upon while our planes were in the no fly zones. WE did not have the authority to overfly IRaq in general. Any nation is justified in firing at an armed warplane that is illegally overflying their territory.\n \n \n2. of course sadar had no power under saddam, he kept his head down for fear of having it chopped off\n\n \n It is not just that he had no power, it was that nobody had ever heard of him except for those in his small, local congregation. Besides, most of the major violence we are seeing is in sunni controled areas. Sadar is a shiaa cleric. YOur eally think that Sunni militants are taking orders from a Shia cleric? Pretty unlikely. If that is what is going on, it means that we managed to do what years of cruelty under saddam could not; unite the Sunni and the Shia to destroy a common enemy.\n \n \n3. who told you they all had military training, if they have its been poor, a personal friend just got back from iraq where he sat on a hummer and was shot at, he told me they were horrible shots and couldnt even control their AK-47s. interesting story too.........\n \n he saw this arab guy come running around a building yelling, exactly like you see in the movies, he stopped, planted his feet, pointed the ak and blaaah, wasted the entire 30 rnd mag up the side of a humvee, hurting nobody and only skinning the paint up a bit, he didnt get a second chance needless to say if he had training then it was pretty poor, this is only one example but he did say they were very bad shots overall, he was there 8 months i think\n\n \n Iraq did not have a volunteer army. Every Iraqi male was a potential conscript and te vast majority of them were required to report for training (there were some exceptions). The Iraqi in the story above panicked. People do this in combat or when they are being shot at. Troops in every army do this, in fact, this is why we switched the M-16 from a full auto weapon to a three round burst. When they studies why our troops in Vietnam were dying, they found that most of them dies with empty weapons. They would empty clip after clip into the brush wthout even looking at what they were shooting at. The VC sould wait until our guys were out of ammo, then stroll up and shoot them.\n \n AS far as the story, I have seen what a clip of 7.62x39 does to the side of a hummer, and it is a lot more than just \"Scratch the paint\" even if it is an armored hummer. The guys in that vehicle are lucky they werent killed. The armor generally mounted on Humvees is designed primarily as blast armor as opposed to being meant ot stop small arms at short range. IF the guy has been using steel tipped rounds, there is a better than average chance your buddy would be a corpse.",

I'm more than a little sure that our military wouldn't use assault vehicles that were vulnerable to AK fire.\n\n \n There are several types of armor used on military and civilian vehicles, generally divided into two classifications, armor repellent and armor proof. The difference being that repellent offers protection from projectiles such as low-velocity shrapnel or handgun rounds hitting that surface at an angle but will not stop a high-velocity projectile while armor proof will deflect higher velocity projectiles up to a rated projectile velocity and size. \n \n To my knowledge the armor on standard military Hummers and most civilian vehicles equipped with armor is repellent level armor and will not stop a high-velocity round. As an example, the Beretta 92 handgun variations fire a round at around 1000FPS while the standard 7.62x39 is loaded to 1600FPS, or over 40% more velocity.\n \n If I was in a Hummer and someone accurately fired 30 rounds of 123-grain steel jacketed bullets traveling 1600FPS at me I would be dead. And the lack of bullet proof Hummers used in Afghanistan and Iraq, as with our inadequate bullet repellent body armor, has long been a bone of contention. Many troops have upgraded their body armor on their own, but its tough for them to refab a Hummer.",
