   "In response to \"Why are you Anti-Christian?\"\n \n The question arises as to what a christian actually is.\n \n Unlike Mohammed, there isn't much information about Jesus in a mundane personal sense. What was his personality like? What kind of sense of humor did he have? What was his favorite food? What did he do in his \"spare\" time? Just because he was God in the flesh doesn't mean he wasn't human.\n \n What does this have to do with anything? Well, I have heard from more than one source that being a christian means following Christ and trying to be more like him, as he was on earth. Recently we have seen \"WWJD\" on liscence plates, necklaces, stickers on guitar cases, etc. I take it to mean that the folks that ask \"WWJD\" assume that Jesus would do the perfect thing in whatever case arises. Despite this, it's difficult to speculate on WWJD in most given situations.\n \n In other religions, most of what is required of you is spelled out plainly. In Islam (or \"submission\") you are expected to submit to the will of Allah. There are various conventions as a part of doing this: praying toward Mecca 5x a day, washing, etc. In Hinduism, there are also various prayers and rituals, and doing these while believing makes you a Hindu (any Hindus out there need to clear this up for me if I'm wrong.)\n \n Ok, I understand that to acheive salvation you must accept Christ in your heart as your personal savior and be baptized by the Holy Spirit. OK, fine, that's how you get saved. That's how you get into heaven. But, that's not the question. \n \n What I am asking is: What does it take to live as a christian?\n \n After your \"saved,\" then what? You've got the whole rest of your life to live. What kind of life should you live to be considered a christian? Should it be Christ-like and what does Christ-like mean?\n \n Thought this might be a nice topic.\n \n \n \n emoticon_xhoho",

   "Well, I'm an athiest myself, but I'm willing to toss in a definition and see how people like it.\n \n A Christian is someone who believes that Jesus is divine.\n \n There are hundreds of branches of Christianity, and half of them point at the other half and say \"They aren't real Christians because they don't believe this certain theological point that I believe.\" The only thing that they all have in common is a belief in Jesus's divinity. Since that's the one factor they have in common, I'd call it the defining factor.",
