   "Gun registry hasn't 'saved a single life'\n \n As Parliament breaks for summer, the opposition is mobilizing to stop a private member's bill to scrap the long gun registry. Yet there is no convincing research showing that the gun registry has saved a single life.\n \n The homicide rate had fallen impressively before 2001, when the long gun registry started, but has remained relatively stable since. In 1991, the homicide rate was 2.7 per 100,000, in 1996, the homicide rate was down to 2.1 and by 2000, it had slid to 1.8. By 2005, the homicide rate had risen to 2.0.\n \n The gun registry had no impact on suicide rates either, even if Canadian suicide rates have declined both before and after 2001. The national suicide rate was 12.6 per 100,000 in 1991, 13.3 in 1996 and 11.7 in 2000. Since 2001, the suicide rate has declined very little; it was down slightly to 11.6 in 2005.\n \n It is time to pull the plug on the long gun registry. The present Canadian firearms program was misdirected from the beginning. It focused exclusively on normal law-abiding people who happened to own firearms, rather than on violent criminals. It should come as no surprise that it hasn't been effective in either saving lives or in combatting criminal violence.\n \n Gary Mauser, professor emeritus, Institute for Canadian Urban Research Studies, Faculty of Business Administration, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, B.

In the UK the police have been caught knowingly massaging the annual crime figures to make the various nations look safer than they really are. And just recently the myth that 90% of all guns found in Mexico and used by the drug cartels came from America, was created by government bureaucrats.

Absolutely nothing.\n \n Wow, question shift.

I could go out, steal a semi truck and crash through the local Wal-Mart, but that doesn't mean that I've actually done something like that, or that I would.\n \n \nThat's something that a registration system has the power to reduce, as either the murderer will have registered their gun (which helps police in their 'major operations'), or they won't (which gives police a chance to prevent it by snagging the murder with the 'paperwork violations' that you dismissed earlier).\n\n \n This whole argument of yours hinges entirely on the mistaken belief that criminal individuals buy their guns from legal revenues. The vast majority of criminals aren't getting their guns from local gun stores, but rather through the black market. Even with straw purchasers your registration agenda is easily defeated by the straw purchaser simply saying the gun was stolen ten minutes after they got it. If they report it stolen before the registration, your plan fails. If they report it stolen after the registration, you now have a police report about a gun being stolen and the last known buyer calling it in.\n \n Simply put there's absolutely no way any registration scheme you can concoct, can be implemented in a practical and workable manner. The Supreme Court has already ruled that no criminal can be compelled to register their guns (which they can't legally have in the first place) so your proposal shifts the focus away from the law-breakers to the law-obeyers. In supporting such a position you're basically coming out and stating that you don't feel regular people can be trusted under any circumstances.\n \n Registration doesn't work, at all. It can only focus on one specific group of people; those who don't break the laws. And focusing on those who are the victims rather than the victimizers makes no sense.

You may not find this 'convincing evidence' - but it is evidence.\n \n With regards to a crime committed with 'your favourite pistol' - the cartridge casings must have come from a certain type of gun; something the police will know. That means they can immediately flag up all the people in the local area who are registered as owning that type of gun; something which is impossible by NATO's 'trace the gun from the manufacturer' approach, as that one does rely on a gun being recovered. If someone has recently reported that gun as being stolen, there is a chance the two crimes are linked; more trails to follow. The fact that you could 'melt down' the original gun has variable impact (depending on the depth of the required registration) - but the fact is, the police would then know that you own a gun which could have fired the casings.\n \n \nSurvey, opinion piece, whatever. A survey is nothing more than a questionnaire, filled out with a person's opinions, and there's no way to verify that they're being accurate in their statements.\n\n This is really quite important. You seem (and come to think of it, I've seen you do this before) to be missing out on some vital knowledge on the nature of statistics and accuracy.\n \n A survey is exponentially more accurate than an opinion piece. A survey aims to be a comprehensive summary of all (biased) opinions across the sample; it should accurately reflect the opinions of the whole, something which a single sample (such as an opinion piece) cannot do. When a restaurant is trialling a new dish, they don't ask the opinion of just one customer - they perform a more accurate survey and ask the opinion of a wide range of customers. All customers will have their opinions, but on a collective scale, those opinions are relevant. For example, if most of the customers don't like the dish, there's probably a good reason for it; maybe a 'chocolate ketchup milkshake' wasn't such a great idea. In our example, most of the people who use the gun registry system to solve crimes consider it to be 'beneficial'. There's going to be a reason for that.\n \n \nYou'll have to excuse me if I refuse to blindly accept a survey or opinion piece released by the government when they have an agenda to achieve.\n\n ...and yet you post the opinion of a single person, who has already declared that he 'represents the NFA', as a worthy example of something to 'blindly accept'?\n You shouldn't be blindly accepting either - you should be questioning the biases and methodology of both. In the case of my survey, this means finding a methodological flaw with the survey, or showing that the government has falsified the figures. Simply saying 'well, they've done it in the past' is not relevant to what they are doing now. It's another reason for looking deeper into their methodology (cf Kellerman), but it's not a reason for discarding it out of hand.\n \n \nAnd many mayors and police chiefs have, for years, claimed that the Tiahrt Amendment was inhibiting their crime fighting abilities, while all of the patrol officers said that this statement was an outright lie (which it was). The ATF and the FBI didn't want the firearms trace data to be released to the general public and used for lawsuits against the gun industry, because it would threaten ongoing undercover operations and put the lives of officers at risk. That's why the Tiahrt Amendment was created. So the police chiefs and mayors being in favor of it going away and letting that information be accessed by anyone, they care more about politics and appearance than actually doing their jobs.\nThe problem with your argument here is that the 'police chiefs and mayors' weren't the people filling in the survey. I listed the people who filled in the survey before; they were: \" 262 general duty patrol officers, 64 criminal investigators and 82 supervisors.\"\n \n \nI've looked for information on the Canadian long gun registry. I've looked on Yahoo, I've looked on Google, and I can't find one single story about the effectiveness of the registry in solving a single crime. There are no stories about murders being solved by consulting the registry, nothing about how the culprits of a drive-by shooting being finally apprehended because they registered their guns before committing their crimes, nothing about how the thug who held up the local convenience store was nabbed because his gun was traced back to him. Absolutely nothing.\n\n Like I said, the police don't tend to publish in-detail reports of specific crimes. If criminals knew the methodology by which they were to be investigated, they would probably be able to better beat the system.\n \n Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.\n \n \nCan you show me any proof that the 50% you refer to actually have or did buy guns before committing a crime? Simply being able to do something doesn't mean that they did. I could go out, steal a semi truck and crash through the local Wal-Mart, but that doesn't mean that I've actually done something like that, or that I would.\nWell, a significant proportion of the violent crimes and murders involved guns, so it's safe to say that those people who (for example) shot someone, had a gun. Whether they obtained it legally or not is another (not evidenced) question, but it's safe to say that they could have.\n \n \nThis whole argument of yours hinges entirely on the mistaken belief that criminal individuals buy their guns from legal revenues. The vast majority of criminals aren't getting their guns from local gun stores, but rather through the black market.\nDo you remember this post? More specifically, this link within that post?\n \n To quote: \"This states that of the sources of illegal guns, most come from straw purchases, the second most frequent method is illegal purchase from a licensed seller, and the third most frequent is someone acting as a middle man who obtains his weapons by one of the first two methods. In short, the vast majority of weapons used in crime have their source in a licensed dealer.\"\n \n Straw purchases are the main way criminals get guns.\n \n \nRegistration doesn't work, at all. It can only focus on one specific group of people; those who don't break the laws. And focusing on those who are the victims rather than the victimizers makes no sense. The whole \"no one is to be trusted, everyone is to be suspected\" approach doesn't work, and it's not legal either.\nWhy do you have to but insurance on a car?

Whether or not ALL police officers were involved remains to be seen. Remember this is a government survey. The government has a vested interest in supporting their billion dollar plus boondoggle that is yet to be complete. It has been demonstrated over and over that governments can and do lie. The canadians did on the registration scam to keep sucking more money down the rathole. It is the typical liberal excuse at work here. Its not working because its not getting enough money or we aren't doing enough of it. Now the subject of this thread is registration has failed to save one life. \n \n As to my hypothetical crime. How do the police know to \"flag\" all the LOCAL people? Perhaps it was from a different area. Plus you are assuming that ALL people will comply with registration. I think most people here would opt for civil disobedience until we could get such laws revoked. Have all Canadians complied yet? I don't think so. Your registration scam is flawed badly. Without total compliance it is worthless. How do you achive that? A further revoking of civil liberties? The \"fact\" that the police know I have a gun or guns of a certain caliber is worthless unless they can produce the murder weapon. Do you have any idea of the number of .45 autos in existance? If I trot out all my registered guns and they are all present and accounted for what then? I have several .45s that not in any registry. One that no one could trace since it came home from WWII and the partys involved have since passed on. Marlin firearms made a camp carbine in .45 auto. One can buy an old rolling block rifle and have it rebarreled for .45 auto. Or if you have the skills do it yourself. Your whole idea of registration hinges on total compliance. You fail to even consider the loss of government weapons such as those sold by soldiers or stolen from the alphabet agencies. \n \n Sadly your registration scam is a giant waste of money. Feels good, does nothing. neither prevents nor solves any crimes. otherwise the media would be trumpeting those facts from the highest rooftops. The two or three claims that they did solve are dubious as other methods were involved. Instead we get the pathetic whine of guns flowing from the US causing crime problems in canada, mexico and even Jamaica.",

   "Gary Mauser & Dave Kopel on Canada & Gun Control on National Review Online\n While the homicide rate in Canada has been gradually declining since the early 1990s, before the gun registry law was introduced, criminologists believe this is probably due to the aging Canadian population. The percentage of homicides involving handguns has doubled in the same time period, as have gang-related homicides. Overall firearms homicides have risen 15 percent in the last five years. Toronto is suffering an unprecedented wave of gang murders.\n \n Gun prohibitionists shrug off rising problems with gang violence, saying that this legislation was targeted at normal people who misuse firearms, not criminals. But in fact, spousal homicides, which had also been slowly declining, suddenly jumped in 2001. The spousal homicide rate is now higher than it was when the firearm registry was introduced in 1997. \n \n The real success of the Canadian registry is not seen in reducing crime, but in fueling a culture war against men. The Coalition for Gun Control (the Canadian gun-prohibition lobby) views reducing gun ownership as a good in itself. The government, along with its coterie of \"women's\" groups, takes the misanthropic view that gun ownership is emblematic of male values that must be destroyed in the new Canada. \n NewsWires: CANADA'S GUN REGISTRATION FAILURE: VIOLENT CRIME RATE DOUBLE THAT OF U.S.\n Canadian Gun Control\n Why Gun Registration has Failed in Canada by Don H.

   "You give us an article about a 1994 report. \n   From your link \n The report states that \"of the 120,370 crime guns that were traced to purchases from the FFLs then in business, 27.7 % of these firearms were seized by law enforcement in connection with a crime within two years of the original sale.\n \n The BATFE published it's most current figures. \n   2007 trace data by the BATFE. \n Page 7 of the Ohio report.\n \n 1/1/2007 to 12/31/2007 National average time to crime 10.33 years. \n \n And they have been very active here.\n   Number of Gun Dealers in U.S. Drops Almost 80 Percent-From 245,628 to 54,902-Since 1994, New Violence Policy Center (VPC) Report Reveals \n \n Your problem, as you so aptly put it to Nato, is, that given the information, the BATFE and law-enforcement, in general, fixes the problem. However, you guys seem to want to claim that it is still a problem, and that can ONLY be fixed by gun control! Or something similar. \n \n We have a great law-enforcement cadre, and allowed to do their jobs, they generally fix many of the problems they are asked to do. And note I said many. Drugs being the exception.",

They should listen carefully to his advice,\" says Linton.\n \n Mauser has studied the fiasco of the clumsy attempt to register firearms in Canada, the evidence showing it is a financial calamity threatening to engulf the current Canadian Government:\n \n Costs have escalated from a projected $2 Million to a current $2 Billion, and no evidence can be found to show that the Gun Registry has accomplished anything of value.\n \n Violent crime & suicide rates remain constant in Canada, even though they are falling in the US. The homicide rate is falling faster in the US than in Canada.\n \n \"The only thing Gun Registration has achieved in Canada is to squander valuable Police resources and $2 Billion of taxpayers hard-earned money,\" claims Linton.\n \n Linton further states that the results of the Canadian experience with gun control mirror those of our western neighbour, Australia, where violent crime has increased 45% since the Australian government imposed \"draconian gun laws by decree.\"\n \n New Zealand Police should be applauded for the decision they made in 1982 to abandon Gun Registration which was a blight on their resources, and had a 40% error rate.\n \n Linton concludes that \"gun control is not crime control. In fact, it is the reverse.\"",
