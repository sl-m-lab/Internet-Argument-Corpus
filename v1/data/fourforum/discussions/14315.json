   "YouTube - Helen Thomas tells Jews to go back to Germany\n \n More BS from the anti-semite hag. She holds a double standard based on subtle antisemitism that has been infecting society for hundreds of years. \"Jews should leave Israel because it's Palestinian land!\" I'm not sure if the argument is \"only Palestinians are entitled to be in Israel\" or \"Jews should stay in their 'home country'\", but either way it's a double standard.\n \n Other than racists, who's saying that Whites, Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians in America, Europe, Australia, etc. should go back to their \"home\" countries? And what about people who are racially or ethnically mixed? \n \n If the argument is \"only Arabs should be in Israel,\" then why is it that Arabs can be in Israel and wherever else they want, but no other race can be in Israel?\n \n And of course, we all know how a Muslim theocracy is so much better than an alleged Jewish theocracy, as demonstrated on September 11, 2001.\n \n So why is it that Jews have no right in Israel because it's supposedly not their home country, but all other races have a right to be wherever they want? Why does this standard only apply to the Jews?",

I refuse to believe that you just think Jews should leave just for the hell of it, especially after you've already asserted that they're not \"God's chosen people.\" That implies that you think Israel is a land for \"God's chosen people.\" I don't see what else your statements can mean.\n \n \nGod's chosen people are those who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.\n\n \n And why, exactly, is that statement any more valid than a Jew saying \"YHWH's chosen people are those who believe in YHWH\" or a Muslim saying \"Allah's chosen people are those who accept that there is no God but Allah?\" In a world filled with people with religious views, why should I take your views more seriously than any of theirs? Why should I care who you think \"God's chosen people\" are?",
