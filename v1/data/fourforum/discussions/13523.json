   "Dr. Margaret Flowers and Mr. Charles Loubert, age 81, who were arrested on Thursday in the most recent wave of actions sweeping the country regarding health care for all, are still jail. \n \n Dr. Flowers and Mr. Loubert are staying in jail until the CEO of CareFirst meets to discuss redirecting lobbying funds to pay for patients' care.\n \n \nBaltimore, MD &#8211; Two physicians and two supporters were arrested today at a sit-in at a Baltimore CareFirst health insurance office. The sit-in is part of a national groundswell of citizens and health care providers demonstrating for meaningful health care reform at insurance company offices.\n \n Doctor Margaret Flowers, a pediatrician who has testified before Congress on the need for meaningful health care reform, was arrested and intends to stay in jail until the CEO of CareFirst has a public meeting with her. She is joined by Charles Loubert, 81, a Baltimore resident and former teacher who was also arrested, and who was denied health care several years ago by his insurer. Both Flowers and Loubert are refusing to give information to the Baltimore police that would lead to their release until Chet Burrell, the CEO of CareFirst, agrees to meet with them publicly to discuss CareFirst redirecting all funds that go to lobbying, advertising, or political contributions to pay for the care of clients who need it.\n \n Physicians and supporters arrested at CareFirst health insurance office to call for real health care reform &#8211; Healthcare-NOW!\n\n \n Here is the full statement from Dr. Flowers:\n \n \nLet me begin by saying that I don&#8217;t have any desire to be arrested. I am a pediatrician with 3 teenagers and a husband who would prefer that I do not spend time in jail. I have never actually spent the night in jail and I imagine it is not very pleasant. To be honest, I am a bit frightened. But, I expect that these are normal feelings and I am dedicated to act despite my reservations because there comes a time for action. That time is now (or &#8220;way past now&#8221; as doctors and patients whom I&#8217;ve met in my travels have told me).\n \n In short, I am going to be arrested again because I believe that it is my professional responsibility to advocate on behalf of those who can&#8217;t and because it is clear that the other traditional advocacy tools are not working. The phrase that runs continuously through my mind is &#8220;To be silent is to be complicit.&#8221; I cannot be complicit in the face of an industry that profits at the cost of human lives and in the face of an administration and Congress that are too dysfunctional to stop this practice.\n \n I have traveled on a unexpected and eye-opening journey this year. In January, I celebrated the inauguration of a new President who I hoped would be the agent to create real change in America. I hoped that we would see changes that benefited the people of America (more than the corporations). I joined the steering committee of the Leadership Conference for Guaranteed Health Care because I believed that if we built the grassroots movement for real health care reform: a national publicly-financed health system that was truly universal and accountable, then we would provide the political cover so that the new administration and the Congress could pass it, or at the very least discuss it. I believed when the administration said that it wanted to hear from the Americans, that we would actually have a debate about how to improve health care in this nation.\n \n Early in the year, I lobbied with many other members of the LCGHC who represented health professionals, patients, labor and faith groups. We had two simple requests: include advocates of single payer in the hearings and do an economic study of single payer legislation so that it could be compared to the plans being put together in Congress. We were assured by members, such as Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, that this would happen. However, before long, we started seeing quotes from the leadership that essentially said all options were on the table except single payer. Ever the optimist, I thought this was simply a signal to work harder. &#8220;OK,&#8221; I told myself, &#8220;they aren&#8217;t going to make this easy. No surprise there.&#8221;\n \n We continued to meet with members, we pressured the White House to invite single payer representatives to the Health Summit in March (which they did) and we continued to reach out to organizations to join our movement.\n \n We thought the health care debate would include the stakeholders (health providers and patients), but found that only the stockholders were invited to the table. When it came time for the first series of public hearings on health care, which were held in the Senate Finance Committee, we requested that one single payer advocate be included with the 41 other witnesses (many of whom represented the private insurance industry, pharmaceutical corporations and big business). Despite thousands of calls and emails from across the country, our request was denied. That is when it became clear that we would have to use stronger tools. On the day of the second hearing, May 5th, 8 of us traveled to Washington to attend the hearing. As it began, we stood up one by one and requested a seat at the table. And one by one we were arrested to the sounds of nervous laughter from the members of the committee and audience. It reminded me of a quote from Gandhi, something like &#8220;first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you and then you win.&#8221; We returned the following week with nurses and more people were arrested in the committee. This time there was no laughter. I guess that meant we were on to phase three: the fight.\n \n For decades, health providers have found it more and more difficult to provide quality health care. The private insurance industry placed more and more obstacles in the way of providers and patients &#8211; co-pays, deductibles, networks, uncovered services, the need for authorization, pre-existing conditions, rescissions, rapidly rising health insurance premiums,etc. And we, the doctors and patients, did our best to comply with the complex and confusing maze of requirements. We saw medicine turned into a business rather than a healing art. Patients became consumers and health care became available only to those who could afford it or were eligible for government programs. Doctors became frustrated and started leaving practice or opening &#8220;boutique&#8221; practices. Many of the doctors I spoke with this summer said things like, &#8220;well, up until about five years ago I could still get care for my patients, but now, I can&#8217;t.&#8221;\n \n For decades, legislators at the state and federal levels have tried incremental health reform. I have heard legislators and health advocates say over and over again, that they are &#8220;diehard incrementalists&#8221; or &#8220;political pragmatists&#8221;. Despite patchwork efforts to expand Medicaid, provide tax credits or subsidies towards the purchase of private insurance or to provide competing public insurances, the number of uninsured and underinsured has continued to grow. The cost of health care in this country has increased faster than wages, inflation and the GDP. How practical is it to keep trying the same thing and expecting a different result?\n \n We, as a nation, have put off the fight we know we will have to wage if we want real health reform. The fight is against the market model of health care and the foe is formidable. The medical-industrial complex has billions of dollars and strong influence over the politicians. The revolving door between the M-I complex and the Congressional staffers is spinning so fast that it is hard to keep track. For instance, Liz Fowler worked for Sen. Baucus, then became Vice President of Public Policy for Wellpoint (one of the largest health insurers) and then returned to the Senate Finance Committee this year to oversee the legislative process for the health bill. There are 6 health insurance lobbyists for each member of Congress and at least 350 of these lobbyists were former staffers. The industry is spending around $1.4 million each day on lobbying.\n \n We are the only industrialized nation to use this market model for health care and it has failed to be either universal or affordable for a very simple reason: the business of private health insurers is to make a profit for their investors which is done by charging high premiums, avoiding the sick and restricting and denying payment for care. Decisions are made based on what is best for the bottom line, not the health of the patient.\n \n The United States ranks at the top in only one area when it comes to health care and that is for how much we spend. We spend twice as much or more per person than any other industrialized nation and for that we are ranked 37th in the world on health outcomes. We have high infant and maternal mortalities, growing health disparities and low life expectancy. The other industrialized nations guarantee health care to almost everybody living on their soil. We leave at least 46 million out entirely and have millions more who are insured but unprotected and so they lose their home or go bankrupt trying to pay for needed health care. We rank the highest of the top 19 industrialized nations for the number of preventable deaths, estimated at 110,000 per year in 2007.\n \n It doesn&#8217;t have to be this way. We have a model that does work for the population it serves, those 65 years of age and over and the disabled. It is traditional Medicare. Medicare is already nationwide. It finances health care with a very low overhead (3% instead of the 31% spent on private insurance) and allows doctors and patients to make medical decisions without jumping through numerous hoops (like private insurers do). The politicians know this, but they try to shut it out because adopting Medicare for all means giving up those generous campaign contributions.\n \n There comes a time when we must ask ourselves if we can continue to delay doing what we know is right. Can we be silent and allow thousands of our fellow Americans to die each year? Is it acceptable to close our eyes and pretend we don&#8217;t see because we may believe that we have &#8220;good insurance&#8221;?\n \n A dear friend of mine recently wrote a song about the health care situation that contains the question &#8220;Isn&#8217;t this America?&#8221; And I ask the same question. If we are spending the most, why aren&#8217;t we trying to be the best? Or at least in the top ten? A national single payer health system, such as Medicare for All, is civilized medicine. It is what civilized societies do for their people. It allows people the freedom to go to school, change jobs, open their own businesses, and provide for their families without the stress of worrying about losing everything if they become ill.\n \n I have decided to join other doctors and citizens in the mobilization for health care reform &#8211; a nationwide coordinated nonviolent civil disobedience campaign for Medicare for all. As we saw in other social justice movements such as women&#8217;s suffrage and civil rights in the 1960&#8217;s, change will not come unless we take a stand. I do this reluctantly because I am still on probation from my arrest in May and so I will likely have to stay in jail. But I do this with resolve for those who would like to act but cannot &#8211; the patients who are suffering and the doctors who are trying to provide care. And I hope that others will join and support the campaign in whatever way they can.
