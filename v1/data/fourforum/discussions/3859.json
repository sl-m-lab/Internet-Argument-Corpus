   "\"Among the repulsions of atheism for me has been its drastic uninterestingness as an intellectual position. Where was the ingenuity, the ambiguity, the humanity of saying that the universe just happened to happen and that when we're dead we're dead?\" ~ John Updike ~\n \n \"I would rather live my life as if there is a God and die to find out there isn't, than live my life as if there isn't and die to find out there is.\" ~ Albert Camus\n \n \n \n These along with the title were given by richbee in the forum \"I don't have enough faith to be an atheist.\n \n I'll start with the first quote by John Updike.\n \n First off this is not an accurate depiction of atheism. Atheism doesn't dictate how the universe was created or what happens after death. It just says that there is no god. Other than that it's up to you to think, use your brain. This is also why the thread title: \"I don't have enough faith to be an atheist\" is not accurate. All you have to do is believe that we weren't created by God. It doesn't in any way relate to evolution, the big bang, etc.\n \n Now his signature, this shows great thought. It's like thinking: \"The church threatened me and if I listen to them the worst thing that can happen is I'll stay the same way I am now\". A more accurate description would be that all you will lose is your freedom of thought. And you will be living your life out of fear. The whole basis of your life will be a fear of going to hell. I respect believers who believe because they actually believe, not were scared into it by the church.\n \n Now the title of this thread, proposed by richbee. You reject a theory of multiple universes because of no proof, this is all agnosticism is. They say there is no proof of god so I don't believe for sure that there is one. They also know you can't prove there is no god so they are not convinced one way or the other. It's a lot better logic than you tried to use. Maybe you should just respect others' beliefs and realize that they've actually thought about their decisions and can do more than just quote a book and other people. You should be able to post quotes but you should actually put a little of your own knowledge and thought into posts as well. I doubt this will have any effect on you at all, but oh well I tried.",

That was the world in which rabbis wrote the Talmud, and in which, earlier, the Bible was written. Asked what is the single greatest revelation I have derived from all my researches, I always respond, \n i &#8220;That there had to have been divine revelation to produce the Torah.&#8221; \n \n The Torah was simply too different from the rest of the world, too against man's nature, to have been solely man-made. \n \n The creation of Western civilization has been a terribly difficult and unique thing. It took a constant delaying of gratification, and a re-channeling of natural instincts; and these disciplines have not always been well received. There have been numerous attempts to undo Judeo-Christian civilization, not infrequently by Jews (through radical politics) and Christians (through anti-Semitism). \n \n The bedrock of this civilization, and of Jewish life, has been the centrality and purity of family life. But the family is not a natural unit so much as it is a value that must be cultivated and protected. The Greeks assaulted the family in the name of beauty and Eros. The Marxists assaulted the family in the name of progress. \n \n Judaism&#8217;s Sexual Revolution: Why Judaism (and then Christianity) Rejected Homosexuality - Click Here",

So these monotheists claim that God cannot be detected.\n\n Yes and no. Typically, the God of Classical Theism (GCT) cannot be fully comprehended. Indeed, it is quite absurd to propose that one can completely comprehend an omniscient entity; they would be omniscient themselves.

   "That is untrue. Furthermore, I'm not making the distinction; I'm telling you the meaning of the words. Someone can believe something might be the case, but not know it. Remember, the problem of induction? I believe that when I drop the hammer it will fall to the ground, but I do not know it. I know that a=a. \n\n dreamweaver, a theist will tell you that they KNOW that God exists, and an athiest will tell you that they KNOW that God doesnt exist. because they are talking about knowledge, does that make them agnostic?\n \n and what do agnostics know? you keep saying that agnosticism talks about knowledge. see the little \"a\" prefixing the word? it means without knowledge. as opposed to theists and athiests, agnostics dont know if God exixts.\n \n \nI'd recommend that you didn't presume that I misunderstand the term, when I've told you the actual meaning of it. You say it's vague: shoot, and tell me why. As far as I see, it could not be clearer; I used precise terminology. \n\n ok, again, let me tell you exactly why your definition is vague. you say that God can do everything possible, and he knows everything. without specifying the limits of \"possible\", nor the limits of what can be known, you leave gaps that need to be filled. questions that probe the clarity of your definition, such as \"can God turn chalk into gold?\" or \"can God know what will happen before it does?\" cannot be answered, because the definition itself isnt clear enough. got it now?\n \n \nNo, let me help you. The words are both Greek; not only am I Greek and know them both, but I have researched the matter and read both Huxley's thoughts on the matter, and that of others'. It is a very common erroneous presupposition, this one that you're making. Check any decent website out there. Preferably a good atheist one; they tend to get the terminology right. If you can't find them, then I'll provide you with the links.\n \n Common talk has brought this problem upon you. Agnosticism talks about knowledge. Someone who \"doesn't believe either way\" is an atheist. The prefix \"a\" is the same as the English \"not\"; an atheist is a non-theist. A theist being someone who believes in the existence of a deity. \n\n and there you have it. a theist believes in the existence of a deity, an atheist believes in no existence of a deity. what is the problem?\n \n \nI'm guessing you didn't read the whole of my post. \n \n Well gee, I'm sorry that you don't know the meaning of \"possible\", but I'll help you out here. I'm talking of metaphysical possibility, not epistemic possibility. I have defined \"possible\" for you time and time again. Something is possible where it is not logically impossible; something logically impossible is something that is incoherent with the laws of logic. There.\n\n saying much and not answering the question. it is logically concievable (but physically impossible) for chalk to turn into gold. similarly it is physically impossible for food to fall from the clouds, or for water to spring from a solid rock, or for someone to walk on water.\n \n can God do the physically impossble?\n \nGeez unkerpaulie, I wish debating with you wouldn't be such a hassle all the time; the hostility (mutual at the moment, I'd say), doesn't really help either. But how about we do something from now -- at least assume the other's intelligence. \n \n Yes; since, your last statement about \"asking atheists\" seems to imply that you are not one; if you are, I should like to ask you the question. Though I imagine you probably wrongly consider yourself a plain agnostic (there's no such thing), I'll wait till I here what you have to say.\n\n what exactly is a \"plain agnostic\" and why is it that there is no such thing? suffice it to say that i have never professed to be an atheist, agnostic or theist. maybe my position shifts around from time to time. \n \n \nRarely, but thanks for assuming that I did. Evolution means \"change\" (in general usage), by \"more evolved\" are you implying \"more changed\"? I certainly think not!\n\n ahh, dreamweaver, you make up in fervor where you lack in imagination. from a baby, an adult is \"more changed\" than a toddler. see how easy that was?",

   "[QUOTE=unkerpaulie\n \n dreamweaver's definitions:\n 1. Agnosticism -- Someone who does not know whether a deity exists or not\n 2. Theist -- One who believes in the existence of God(s)\n 3. Atheist -- someone who does not believe in the existence fo a [any] deity\n 4. There is no such thing as a \"plain agnostic\" since an agnostic is always either an agnostic-atheist, or an agnostic-theist.\n 5. Agnosticism speaks of knowledge, not of beliefs. \n \n based on the premises that 1, 2 and 3 are correct, and 2 and 3 speak of belief, then either the terms \"agnostic-atheist\" and \"agnostic-theist\" are self-contradictory (both involve simultaneous states of beliefs and not-beliefs) or statement 5 is wrong\n i think statement 4 is totally unfounded and most likely the easiest to be eliminated. statement 5 is inadequate because \"speaks of knowledge\" is much too vague\n qed[/QUOTE]\n \n Those definitions are correct, except #1 agnostics don't generally say \"I don't know\", they say \"it cannot in principle be known\"..by anyone is the implication.\n \n regarding 4. Logically you either believe, or do not believe. There is no other option. If you argue that the object of the belief is \"unknowable\", super, but you still either believe or do not believe. So choose, either you think contradictions can be \"believed in\"..i.e. can exist, or you think they cannot, and thus, do not believe.\n \n regarding 5. Agnosticism is philosophical position...namely the skeptic position on things divine. It's redundant as DW points out, and as I pointed out on the last thread about this topic, and ultimately it confuses people (as evidenced by this long thread where it's STILL not clear to everyone). Most agnostics are by definition, atheists, if they aren't atheists, they are theists.\n \n Atheism does NOT require one to claim GOD DOES NOT EXIST. It only requires \"no belief in god\".\n \n \n I do not believe a square circle exists.\n For that matter...\n I do not believe a square exists.\n \n I use this concept of a square all the time, we can discuss it, draw it, etc., but I DO NOT BELIEVE a square exists. A square circle is a contradiction, and likewise, I do not believe such a contradiction exists.\n \n Unless you can show (and maybe you can) that speaking of \"belief\" when discussing a square circle is nonsensical, then you're stuck with the definitions DW gives. Notice the agnostic position reduces to:\n \n One cannot know XYZ (a diety in this case)\n << If one cannot know XYZ, can one logically believe in XYZ?\n No. So agnostics are either confused atheists (without belief in a diety), or confused theists.\n \n -Mach",

Read the above defintions dreamweaver gives for agnostics. They all have something in common - all are irrational positions, or positions synonymous with ignorance.\n \n Logically, there is no god, to ask for proof, as you do, of the illogical, is fallacy. To suggest we cannot know for sure there is no god, is illogical. By the run of the mill definition, claims with regards to god are illogical. There can no more be a god that exists than there can be a square circle that exists. This is why the god issue is not unanswerable, but often misunderstood. This is why there must be a phenomenon called faith, in opposition to reason, a word that describes the process of denying reality.\n \n I believe a man can be ressurected by a supernatural being based on [a denial of reality]. Yep, it works!\n \n Stating that atheism is not \"proven\", and that agnosticism is proven, is like saying:\n \n Atheism: I believe the concept of knowing the unknowable is a logical contradiction.\n \n Agnosticism: I believe we should prove the unknowable, through logic, and thus, know it, but we simply have not yet.\n \n Theism: I believe we can know the unknowable (based on faith).\n \n Atheism is the only rational choice.

It's the same as claiming \n \"Prove that all circular squares have four corners.\"\n It's a nonsensical question, it's a logical contradiction.\n \n Supernatural is defined as \"beyond the observable universe\".\n Which is, not knowable, by definition. You then claim \"I know something of the unknowable\", a logical contradiction.\n \n Logically, there are no contradictions.\n \n It doesn't just apply to god either, a great many proposed \"insightful\" or \"philosophical\" questions are bogus logical contradictions. You don't prove existence or non-existence of god, you don't get to even rationally have that discussion. If your claim involves knowledge of the unknowable, your contradiction is thrown out as fallacy. We aren't discussing thoughts/concepts in the mind, we're talking about people claiming a god exists/created the universe, etc., etc., a god of reality.\n \n Making claims as true, about things which we define as \"unobservable\", or \"unknowable\", is contradictory, in that everything we know, is through observation, either direct or indirect, in the universe. These claims about knowledge of things outside the universe, or outside of reason, or outside of logic, or outside of observation, are all logical contradictions. Knowledge itself requires justification, and again, you cannot say you have knowledge of \"something that cannot be proven true or false\". It's a contradiction.\n \n \n So yes, it then follows that agnosticism is either:\n \n An incorrect position that is founded in ignorance...that is, lacking knowledge of the contradiction they ponder. (see \"I don't know\")\n \n OR\n \n Intentional denial that they are pondering a contradiction despite evidence to the contrary, which is irrational/illogical/insanity (see theology).\n \n Either way, they are ignorant, either through choice, or by accident. Atheism is the acceptance of the rational/logical, either ignorantly (if somone hasn't bothered justifying their belief), or reasonably, with justification. I prefer justified beliefs. \n \n Logically, there can be no meaningful claims of knowledge with regards to things beyond knowledge, by definition. \n \n -Mach",

   "That was the point of my proof. If God is defined as unknowable (undetectable is the word I used,) then atheism is proven. \n \n However, there are other definitions of God. Polytheistic religions, for example, revolve around gods who live in volcanos, in the sky, etc. In my opinion, the unicorn principle applies to those gods. We haven't detected unicorns, though they are defined as detectable. The positive claim (i.e. the claim that \"Zeus exists and lives on top of that mountain!\") has the burden of proof in these cases. It is irrational, however, to claim that a possible being (like unicorns or Zeus) is completely impossible. Sure, these things are improbable, but they aren't like round squares.\n \n That said, I am both an atheist and an agnostic, depending on what definition of God is used.\n\n \n I agree. But go the one step further and correctly classify yourself as atheistic on both counts. Atheism is not about probability or impossibility, it's a statement of belief or non-belief. You have no belief that Zeus exists, and your definition of zeus as \"never having been observed\" would then mean logically that if you DID believe in Zeus, you'd be insane/illogical. You MUST accept that you either:\n Claim that Zeus exists.\n Claim that Zeus does not exist.\n Claim that the word Zeus has no meaning to you.\n \n #1 is theism\n #2/#3 are both atheism...i.e. no belief in \"Zeus\", since it's a meaningless statement.\n \n I like your hard-line stance on skepticism, and I agree with it, yet we're still atheists. And we have different definitions of belief, that aren't necessary to distinguish though, because if you are a hard-line skeptic and belive only in existence, and think of everything else in terms of probability, then you are still an atheist, because by definition you do not believe in a god.\n \n -Mach",

   "You claim I'm incorrect, based on..well, nothing so far. \n\n There's simply no limit to your wit! \n \nThought, in and of itself, implies at least existence and consciousness, self, and language (English)\n\n This is a very large debate in and of itself. You'd have to clarify what you mean by language, but I would certainly disagree. I wouldn't say that thought is contingent upon thought; in fact, I'd say the exact opposite. Thought isn't slave to language. \n \nWe miscommunicate here.\n\n Perhaps; you misunderstood me. I never suggested that you disagreed with me. I merely said that if you did, then...\n \nThe reason I mention this is because while you believe those definitions are correct despite others disagreeing (I agree they are correct), you reject the definition of supernatural, on no grounds.\n\n Now this is a strawman. Show me where I rejected your definition. \n \n Funnily enough, I wouldn't think your definition of supernatural is appropriate, but I'd be willing to assume it for the argument. You see, your definition doesn't allow for \"supernatural intervention\", and I don't know of any theists that would consider that to be the case apart from some deists, probably. The other definition on there would probably suffice: \"Attributed to a power that seems to violate or go beyond natural forces.\" Above all, I still prefer the definition at Wikipedia: \"The supernatural refers to conscious magical, religious or unknown forces that cannot ordinarily be perceived except through their effects. \"\n \nAppropriate platform? It's part of your defense, either we discuss it or we throw it out.\n\n Hah! Just nothing gets by you. Sneaky evil dreamweaver planned this all along. Stop making palpably frivolous points. I already said it will probably suffice, and I'm willing to discuss it. You have thrown it out by not answering my question. \n \nStraw man. I claim to have knowledge of something that EXISTS, requires perception (and the above mentioned thought/existence/self, etc.). Perhaps this is your fatal flaw\n\n Indeed. But this claim is wilder than I thought; no worries.\n \n Ok. You've made the claim; now let's see the justification for it. Your sentence above is a little tricky grammatically, but let me go ahead and assume that you're saying \"we can only have knowledge of things existing that we can sense through perception\". If you don't agree with this, then don't respond, and merely clarify your position with a clearer statement.\n \n Anyhow, the objection:\n (i) Why can we not reason, using our current knowledge, to see whether a being exists? For example, Aristotle's Cosmological argument that speaks of potentiality and actuality; that solely reasons whether a being can exist and doesn't rely upon us \"perceiving\" the being. Other arguments as such include the Teleological Argument and the Modal Ontological Argument.\n \n Note I'm not claiming the truth of these arguments, and neither do I need to. They're examples of ways in which one could, in theory, prove the existence of another being. The arguments wouldn't fail because of your criticism above, if they did. \n \n? the knowledge of physics is founded on, among other things, logic. Ah, I see now, directed to Zach. Still stands, physics is consistent with logic.\n\n Weird point. I never denied it. But still, the laws of physics and the laws of logic are not the same. The one is based upon induction and empirical methods of verification, while the latter is a deductive axiomatic system based on apodictic truths. \n \nReligion, of course, is not. Religion is essential sophistry, it is founded both on the logical, and the illogical, and makes no effort to reconcile the two.\n\n More incredibly wild, unsubstantiated, and ungrounded claims.",

Just like atheism, and theism. \n Your definitoin of supernatural is synonymous with extraordinary, which is natural...i.e. not average. A woman surviving a fall when her parachute doesn't open. Not ordinarly observed, but certainly not \"beyond the natural\".\n If you mean that supernatural literally means a natural event, caused by something that cannot be sensed, then you're back to my definition, back to unknowables. To claim something natural was CAUSED by something supernatural, takes us back to accepting (on faith) that there was something supernatural to cause it, and you know it can cause natural things to occur. Knowledge of the unknowable. \n \n \nOk. You've made the claim; now let's see the justification for it.

The arguments wouldn't fail because of your criticism above, if they did. \n \n Ah, but no skin in the game? You're sounding agnostic in your avoidance of the issue. If you don't offer them as truths, why would I need to look at them? But I will anyway, as I mentioned above.\n \n In reading old posts of yours, many months ago, I was inspired by your rigid adherence to logic...so don't think I don't appreciate your posting, you've already contributed to my character.\n \n -Mach",

   "Here's another definition from dictionary.com which seems to coincide with this definition:\n \n Of or relating to existence outside the natural world. \n Attributed to a power that seems to violate or go beyond natural forces. \n Of or relating to a deity. \n Of or relating to the immediate exercise of divine power; miraculous. \n Of or relating to the miraculous. \n \n \n So basically superenatural is outside the world that we can sense.

   "Yes, big philosophical issue according to the wide array of beliefs on the topic. But I bet there is a reasonable answer, and a lot of illogical ones. There would have to be..right?\n\n Array of beliefs doesn't seem to be too wide to me, but with regard to your question -- I think so; and I'm quite sure it's not the one you seem to hint at. Willing to debate this if you make the thread; it's quite off-topic here. \n \nBut you know these all must point to either natural, or beyond the natural, in principle. Just like atheism, and theism.\n Your definitoin of supernatural is synonymous with extraordinary, which is natural...i.e. not average.\n\n Not at all.

They were just examples that I thought you'd be familiar with, but it doesn't matter. The main point still stands. Why can we not determine whether something exists by reason, and why should we restrict it to only that which we perceive?\n \n But, there are thousands of websites dealing with each of those arguments. Feel free to look them up, of course.\n \nAh, but no skin in the game?\n\n Geez, I wish you wouldn't always presume that I'm \"side-stepping\"/not-commiting.

Sure enough, I am an agnostic[-theist].\n \nIf you don't offer them as truths, why would I need to look at them? But I will anyway, as I mentioned above.\n\n I stated the reason above in the \"Note\", and again here in the post. It's the principle of the arguments. What they aim to do; but, more importantly, how they go about it.\n \n The fact of the matter is, Mach, you think you've stumbled across some \"loophole\" in definitions and consequently that all agnostics [over the millenia] are silly, ignorant or illogical people.
