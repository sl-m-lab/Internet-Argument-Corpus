   "I responded in the Gay Rights forum to a comment about the golden rule not being unique to Christianity and existing in most major religions and cultures. I've seen that claim before, but I think it really completely misses the point of what Jesus is saying. I'd like to elaborate on this here. I think Jesus' form of it IS unique, at least for the most part, at that time (and most subsequent examples were probably influenced by him).\n \n Wikipedia lists several examples of 'the golden rule' from it's page on \"Ethic of Reciprocity\" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethic_of_reciprocity) which was linked in the other thread by the poster who prompted the response. Here are some examples ...\n \n  * \"Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself: I am the lord.\" - Torah Leviticus 19:18\n * \"When an alien lives with you in your land, do not mistreat him. The alien living with you must be treated as one of your native-born. Love him as yourself, for you were aliens in Egypt. I am the lord your God.\" - Torah Leviticus 19:33-34\n * \"This is the sum of duty; do naught unto others what you would not have them do unto you.\" - Mahabharata (5:15:17) (c. 500 B.C.)\n * \"What you do not wish upon yourself, extend not to others.\" - Confucius (ca. 551 - 479 B.C.)\n * \"What is hateful to you, do not to your fellow man.\" - Hillel (ca. 50 B.C. - A.D. 10)\n To repeat what I said in the other forum, in most every case listed in the Wikipedia listings (particularly the pre-Jesus ones), the wording is \"do not unto others\". \"Or do naught unto others.\" In other words, the message is: don't harm others because you wouldn't want it done to yourself. However Jesus' version goes a significant step further and changes it (in keeping with the gist of the whole Sermon on the Mount) by saying what you DO, \"DO unto others as you'd have them DO unto you.\" The negative is changed to a positive, from not just the absence of doing bad to actually doing GOOD toward others. He clearly intentionally changed the golden rule (as it was already known) to not just be about 'not-hurting-people' to be about doing good. In other words, he up'ed the ante on the Golden Rule. This is consistent with the rest of the Sermon on the Mount, where he takes things like having to carry a cloak for a soldier to taking yet an extra mile over and above what is expected. The whole sermon is about up'ing the ante from the standards of society to a morality that goes beyond it. That's why it's ironic when people claim the Jesus' golden rule was no different than what was already in place in \"virtually all major religions and cultures\"; it's not the same. It's about going the extra mile, beyond  those very standards of culture.\n \n I often hear the claim made that the golden rule appears in supposedly nearly every culture and religion, a claim no doubt made sometimes because some can't stand the idea of the Bible possibly actually having a novel and superior uniqueness when it comes to a moral code. While it may be true that the \"golden rule\" has been around a lot longer than the Bible, that's not necessarily Jesus' form of the golden rule, which definitely goes farther. The very few non-Christian examples I saw in the list of the \"DO unto others\" approach were post-Jesus rather than pre-Jesus, and were well after Christianity had spread, so it's very possible that the changes were influenced by Jesus' brand of golden rule.",

I think that's somewhat iffy. It's pretty vague compared to the version Christ gave. In fact it reads more like an ulterior motive kind of passage--\"wishing to be established himself\".

And thats with the twisting that yours needs to do being included - without the twisting, the sentence is reduced to utter gibberish.\n \n Now, let's go through it using the definition that actually makes sense:\n \"We should conduct ourselves toward others as we would desire they should conduct themselves toward us.\"\n \n Please, look this over, in a calm, rational way, before you continue.\n \n \n Your point on the other possible meanings of 'bear' is taken however. \n\n I should hope so, given that your meaning makes no sense whatsoever unless you twist the quote entirely!\n \n\n Though it's still more vague than Jesus' version.\n \n\n Only because you seem to want it to be.\n \n \n\n But we don't know the context of Plato's statement.

He first says something aboutpeople not touching or removing things without his consent. Then, after a semicolon (in it's own independent clause), he states his version of the \"Golden Rule\". The part you bolded is not a part of the reciprocity (because there is no reciprocity involved) - the reciprocity is in the part you didn't bold (the part originally quoted). Also, he states that it is part of the principle, and then lists TWO DIFFERENT THINGS (with the semicolon and the \"and\", this makes it pretty clear) that make up that principle - one of not allowing others to touch his things, and one of reciprocity.\n \n And as Kronus said, three counter examples have been given.

(I'm feeling a bit lazy right now :))\n \n The reason your definition was absurd was because, as you yourself pointed out, context always matters. In the context of the given sentence, \"bear\" could only mean one thing. It would be absurd to think it meant \"tolerate\", no matter how common that usage; that would make absolutely no sense, the sentence wouldn't parse. It could only mean \"to conduct\" in context. In fact, \"bear ourselves towards\" is nothing more than a different way of saying \"do unto\". Which, of course, makes it right on par with what Jesus said, only 300+ years earlier. Your point was simply incorrect, and the simple fact is that Aristotle said it well before Jesus.",
