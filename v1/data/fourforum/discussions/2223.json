   "Mordechai Vanunu was released today after spending 18 years in prison at Ashkelon's Shikma Prison at 11 am local time.\n \n Well a secret seems to have slipped out today, literally, but not without bruises. Vanunu has said he \"had been subjected to cruel and barbaric treatment during his incarceration.\" \n \n Well that doesn't sound like the Israel I know. To wrongly convict a man and treat him badly while in their holdings. Hogwash I say.\n \n Israel doesn't have nuclear programs or anything of the sort. Because that would intensify the hypocrisy when they point fingers at their neighbors and yell to the west to take action. You see if Vanunu was telling the truth then all these non-proliferation pacts that Israel hasn't signed would be necessary and I for one believe Israel. Why? Because they are democratic and fair and free and that is just one more reason why they treated Vanunu with the utmost delicacy. What a liar he is.\n \n And he's also saying that he wasn't apprehened by the infamous Mossad, but by a CIA or FBI operative, but that would mean that the U.S. was in bed with Israel to cover up their nuclear programs and the lies that followed, preposterous!\n \n Listen Israel is at a crucial point in time where security can not be taken lightly. This man and his followers are a bunch of propaganda spinning liars, I think. Anyway we must restrict his words because now is not the time for the truth. In the name of Israel we must be careful what we say, this is democracy damnit and we need to keep it. So hush hush little Vanunu, come back to us in another 18 years when we have a little more of the West Bank and then we can talk about truth.\n \n Nuclear arms? Why would Israel want those crazy things anyway? We have America on speed dial and they told us we have some within 24 hours if we pinky swear that we only hurt the bad guys.\n \n Oh here are a couple links with the actual story\n http://www.haaretzdaily.com/hasen/spages/417702.html\n http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/mi...ast/3640613.stm\n \n Remi",
