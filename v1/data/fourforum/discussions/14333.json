   "Sorry if this has been asked before but search turned up no results specific to my plight. I have a Motorola RAZR2 V9 cell phone, got it few weeks ago. Everything is working well, but it is not being detected by MPT 5.1 using the USB data cable. I want to get all of my contacts from Outlook 2007 into Razr2 V9. Can anyone help me to make it work properly?\n \n Thanks in advance.",
