   "Before anyone points out this is in the wrong forum, I know. I didn't post it in the correct forum because it's ridiculous having 50+ forums/subforums while many users only browse 2-3. (That's also the reason I use the 'new posts' button rather than usual browsing).\n \n Anyway.\n \n I've got to enter a debate with 3 other people. The format is fairly simple.\n \n Vote is taken as to how many of the floor approve/oppose/are neutral about the motion.\n \n 1st speaker is FOR the motion \"This house would introduce compulsory ID cards for all British citizens\".\n 2nd speaker (my partner). He gives reasons against ID cards (civil liberties, cost etc.)\n 3rd speaker is FOR the motion. \n 4th speaker: ME! I'm against ID cards.\n \n Then 1st/2nd/3rd/4th speaker can ask each other Qs.\n \n After this the floor can ask us any relevant questions they want.\n \n Vote is taken as to how many of the floor approve/oppose/are neutral about the motion.\n \n The 'winner' is decided on how the floor swings.:)\n \n The debate is on Tuesday.\n \n Our current plan is for my partner, speaker 2, to give a list of reasons why we shouldn't have ID cards. These will centre around ID cards' cost (\u00a310-\u00a319bn according to LSE), intrusion of privacy and the point that a biometric passport (already being introduced here) can theoretically do everything an ID card can, so what's the point of ID cards? There are of course more reasons not to have them, but we're concentrating on the above. We'd rather have a few water-tight points than dozens of weak points.\n \n My 'speech' will be a little different. I'm going to list the reasons for ID cards and then try to take each of them apart. I'm predicting that the main reasons for ID cards will be:\n \n Identity Theft (actually, in Australia ID theft increased since the introduction of similar identification measures)\n \n Illegal immigration and working (People don't work illegal because of fake ID. They work illegally because the employer knows they're working illegally so can treat them like dirt. ID cards won't stop illegal immigration for blindingly obvious reasons.)\n \n Misuse of Public services ('Health tourism' doesn't really exist in the UK. People LEAVE the UK to get treated because the NHS is so XXXX. Boy saving 30p ion bus journey is misuse of public services, but Government spending \u00a310-\u00a319bn isn't?! What the f***?)\n \n Organised crime and terrorism prevention. (Ex MI5 chief said this was utter rubbish. Terrorists operate illegally, ID card won't stop this. Money should be spent on counter-terrorism instead. Didn't help with Madrid bombings.)\n \n \n http://www.identitycards.gov.uk/library/Id_Cards_Briefing.pdf\n \n Those are the 4 main reasons given by the government, so I figure they'll be the main ones used.\n \n I'll post my planned 'speech' soon. It will be fluid though, so I might change it in accordance of what they say.\n \n Advice/comments welcome.\n \n -Wez",

   "'Speech' which I'll adapt as the debate goes on. I'll cut any points out they don't mention, so as to not fight strawman arguments. Please bear in mind everyone involved in this is 16-18.:)\n \n \nGood afternoon.\n \n The Government, Hannah and [partner's name] have given some appealing reasons for introducing compulsory ID cards. Rather than restate Jonnie's strong arguments against ID cards, I'll go into the reasons Hannah and partner gave as to why we SHOULD have ID cards and shed a bit more light on them.\n \n [possible cases they'll make for ID cards]\n \n Identity theft\n \n I'll start with the claim that ID cards will help to reduce 'Identity theft'. The obvious problem with this claim is that 'identity theft' is not actually a crime. When someone says \"identity theft\" they can mean just about anything. Credit card fraud, insurance fraud and benefits fraud all qualify as \"identity theft\". I don't see how ID cards can stop any of these though. How can an ID card stop someone from stealing your credit card? It can't. How can an ID card stop someone from faking an accident and claiming insurance? It can't. How can an ID card stop someone from collecting unemployment/ pension benefits while they're secretly working? Once again, it can't. The government even admits this. Their own figures state that of the \u00a31.3billion Identity theft costs the nation, ID cards could, at most, tackle \u00a335mil. Yet ID cards would cost \u00a310-\u00a319bn. The maximum they can save is about 2% of what they'd cost to implement.\n \n If anything, ID cards will increase \"identity theft\". Even the most hi-tech and advanced ID cards can and will be faked. The more the card is needed, the more it is worth to someone who can forge it. The Australians found this out the hard way. Within two months of their new high security hologram Bank and ID cards being issued, forgeries starting coming into circulation. Fraud cases rose by, according to the Australian Institute of Criminology, 18% in between 1995 and 1999 after the ID cards were introduced. The reason for this is simple. An ID could be used for anything. Before, people had to have several means of identification, so forging meant a lot of hard work and cross-referencing, while once an ID card (Tax File Number) was introduced, you only had to produce one counterfeit document.\n \n As I've shown, in this case, the introduction of ID cards did the exact opposite of what it was supposed to do and people paid dearly for this, while criminals reaped the rewards. Personally, I think we should learn from the mistakes of others.\n \n Illegal immigration and working\n \n Hannah and partner claimed that ID could help combat illegal immigration. I don't see how they reached this conclusion. The whole point about illegal immigration is that the immigrants don't register with the Government or local authorities, so won't register for ID cards. The only way ID cards could be used to counter illegal immigrants, is by finding the illegal immigrant, stopping him and asking him for ID. The problem is the police can't even find the illegal immigrants in the first place and if somehow they do, how can they tell the difference between someone who is here illegally and someone who has lost their ID card or left it at home? They can't.\n \n ID cards wouldn't tackle the problem of people working unlawfully. People who employ illegal immigrants KNOW that they're employing illegal immigrants. That's why they employ them. They can treat the immigrant like dirt and pay them next to nothing. How is an ID card going to stop this? Clearly it isn't.\n \n If you really wanted to stop illegal immigration, instead of wasting money on ID cards, money should be spent on border controls to make sure people don't get in, rather than let them in and then try to evict them.\n \n Misuse of Public services\n \n It was asserted that ID cards could be used to combat misuses of public services. The Home Office in its \"Identity card briefing\" claims that ID cards could be used to minimise \"wastes\" on \"public resources\". I find it ironic that the government wants to crack down on 'wasting public resources', but is prepared to spend \u00a310-\u00a319 billion on an ID card scheme, money that could have been put into educational, medical and security services.\n \n Hannah/partner/ The government claimed ID cards could also stop 'Health tourism'. For those that don't know, health tourism is defined as \"A holiday to take advantage of health-care services\". That sounds like a serious threat to the NHS, but wait minute. The Island we live on is surrounded by Germany, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium and Holland. All these countries have better health services than we do. Why on earth would anyone cross a large stretch of water to receive our health service, when they could stay on the continent and get far better treatment? Ironically, the NHS actually sends thousands of Britons abroad every year for vital treatment due to long waiting lists in the UK.\n \n If you (*looks at Hannah/partner*) really care about our nation's health, then why not spend the \u00a310-\u00a319 billion ID cards would cost on the NHS? \n \n Terrorism\n \n One of the oddest claims the Government, Hannah and partner made was that ID cards could somehow combat terrorism. To me this makes no sense at all. The Home Office, according to its own figures, admits that the vast majority of terrorists don't use, want or need fake ID. The London Bombers didn't need it; they were British and would have been able to legally register for an ID card and then commit the atrocities. Likewise the Madrid bombers managed perfectly well to commit their terrorist attacks despite Spain already having ID cards. The reasons why ID cards can't combat terrorism are simple. You don't need an ID card to enter the country illegally, you don't need an ID card to purchase explosives unlawfully and you don't need an ID card to blow yourself up.\n \n The intelligence services agree that ID cards wouldn't help counter terrorism. In November 2005 Dame Stella Rimington, former Director General of MI5 said:\n \n \"ID cards have possibly some purpose. But I don't think that anybody in the intelligence services, particularly in my former service, would be pressing for ID cards\"\n \n Or how about former home-secretary David Blunket, who said \"ID Cards won't stop terrorism\". Or maybe the current home secretary, Charles Clarke who, the day after the London bombings, when asked if ID cards could have prevented the attacks said \"I doubt it would have made a difference.\" \n \n So the intelligence services believe ID cards wouldn't counter terrorism, the home secretary believes ID cards wouldn't counter terrorism and we even have evidence in the form of the Madrid bombings that ID cards can't stop terrorism. If you really care about saving lives, why not spend the \u00a310-\u00a319 bn ID cards would cost on counter-terrorism units?\n \n Restate Jonnie's reasons why ID cards are bad\n \n *need to wait for what jonnie's saying*\n \n Conclusion\n \n *need to wait for what jonnie's saying*\n\n \n Comments welcome. I think I may need to shorten it a bit.\n \n -Wez",
