However deficits depend on both increased spending and lower revenues. Bush has done both with large tax cuts and large discretionary spending increases. And even the conservatives are beginning to criticize him for being a big spending president. Over the past 23 years, 'conservative' administrations have increased the deficits and 'liberal' administrations have decreased the deficits. So yeah it looks to me like left wing is against deficits and right wing is for deficits.",

There is even much less support for legally recognizing those relationships in any way shape or form. In fact, I don't know of any major national polls done on these issues, if any have been done. I suppose this is because it is so obvious there would be very miniscule support for pedophiles or polygamists, either no one does the polls, or the polls are not widely reported on because they represent no change in attitudes.\n \n Gay marriage has much more support. I don't believe it has to be a 50% plus one majority. The poll numbers are taken often, and change often.

You all basically support stifling free speech when that speech is opposed to gay marriage, etc...\nI don't think they have a problem with you voicing your opinion, the problem comes when you want to force those beliefs upon the rest of society. Two people have the right to enter into wedlock with one another if they wish, regardless of gender. By allowing gay marriages we still allow straight marriages. We do not have to choose one or the other, we can accept both. Does it cause you any harm to allow gay marriages if it does not go against your rights? No, it does not. You can still denounce their marriage and tell everyone how much you hate it, because you have that freedom.\n \n \nThat's why you and Charchump inject the words bigot, homophobe, etc...People like you and Charchump slur others and try and label them when people post stuff that runs counter to what you want.\n\n It sounds as if you wish to abolish a few descriptive words. If they call you a bigot, they, most likely, feel justified in what they say. The same goes for homophobe. And it seems to me that you do classify as a person suffering from homophobia. In the dictionaries I have looked under that means having fear or contempt for lesbians and gay men. You certainly seem to have contempt for homosexuals from what I have seen.\n \n It seems, though, that you have a problem understanding that word; homophobe. Fine. I'll put it another way. You act as someone who considers homosexuals inferior. You seem to hold contempt for homosexuals. For me, you classify as a homophobe.\n \n \nAt least Rank only resorts to playing word games and games of semantics. They are still games nonetheless. He didn't refute my points, and others reading the post will know what I meant, so it really doesn't matter.\n\n It seems, to me, that he did make a few good points, and even refuted a few of your own. Perhaps you would like me to refute them as well? Of hope that by making that contradicts your own you do not suddenly claim it moot because, quite suddenly, I've gotten involved in a game or words.\n \n \n \nActually we have a constitution that states what our freedoms are. The Constitution gives the people the right to implement a Constitutional Amendment to, as in this case, keep the notion of traditional marriage being takem away from the majority of Americans who oppose gay marriage. Gay marriage hasn't presently been legalized.\n\n The constitution never stated sexual freedoms. When it comes to matters such as that, I believe Americans rely on the Supreme Court to interpret the constitution and law to make a decision that will continue to protect our rights without descrimination.\n \n As for a majority of Americans opposing gay marriages. America has a little something called minority rights, where the minority will not suffer a loss of freedoms due to the majority. Gay marriage will not become mandatory, you will not find yourself forced into it by a majority or minority. Gay marriages exist as a choice between two people of the same sex who care deeply for one another and wish to express their love through matrimony. Their choices for entering marriage aren't mush different than heterosexuals' choices for doing the same thing.\n \n \nSo for the courts to force gay marriage upon the majority of Americans would be taking away something from them.\n\n The legalization of gay marriage would take nothing away from the majority. They could still marry with the opposite sex if they wished, and they could still tell everyone about the wrongs of homosexuals and homosexual marriage.\n \n \nSo in your opinion, if it comes down to it and its either going to be the minority or the majority who gets their way, it should be the minority that gets what they want?\n\n What if the majority believed we should execute all homoesexuals? Should we still choose their beliefs over that of the minority? No. When the choices get made all sides of the argument should be kept in mind, but the choice that continues to protect the freedoms and equality of all, and does not bring harm upon others should be the choice made.\n \n Please excuse me for any words cames I might have unkowningly played. I hope it does not justfiy your continued use of name calling to the opposing debaters.\n \n Goturuge",

   "might i just make an point regarding the harms principle? Because I think it solves for alot of the issues brought up towards the middle (the polygamy/pedophilia/crack point).\n \n The harms principle (explained by J.S. Mill) basically states that your freedom is absolute up until the point where it violates the freedom of others (my right to wave my fist ends at your nose). This is perhaps the clearest moral standard that can be created for justifiable govt. action, combining both liberal \"rights expansion\" and conservative limited govt.. The harms principle holds that, unless an action violates the right of someone, the action is outside the realm of jurisdiction of the government. Social Contract theory states that we give up some of our liberties to the government to safeguard the rest. From this, it is only logical that the minimum amount of freedom should be given up to maintain those basic protections, and beyond that all freedoms are reserved to the individual. Hence, the harms principle. This is enshrined currently in our own system of govt. via the 9th amendment.\n It should be noted that a change in the discourse or orthodoxy is not considered a \"harm\" by Mill. Thus, saying that a certain action, or speech, makes one uncomfortable, or \"devalues\" another institution in an abstract (rather than concrete) manner, is not a harm per se.\n \n now, let's apply the harms principle to each of the \"slippory slope\" examples brought up.\n Pedophilia: violates rights of children, who legally can't \"consent\"\n Bestiality: animals can't consent either\n Polygamy: admissable. So now tell me why its wrong.\n Crack: this ones tricky, but i do think it can be banned. Because drugs so fundamentally effect ones decision making abilities and can be reasonably be assumed to add to the propensity of rights violation in the future.\n Cannibalism: Violation of rights. Again, this ones a little tough, but I don't think one can violate his/her own rights either (can u sell ureself into slavery?)\n \n Homosexuality, therefore, ought to be protected under the harms principle.",

I guess you might have an argument if prohibition was making some progress. But every year more and more judges and saying it&#8217;s getting worse in every category. If someone is so addicted to a drug that they will sell themselves into prostitution to get it, why do you think a law would make any difference?\n \n So it&#8217;s not a gray area for me.

Crack I would say harms the individual far more than alcohol. However, alcohol leads to harm in innocent victims far more often than crack. When it comes to crackheads smoking too much and having their hearts explode, I say go for it. When it comes to drunks getting behind the wheel and wiping out families of 6, I start to have a problem. \n \n 2. When you look at it though, I would still say crack is far worse a problem than alcohol. There are many people who drink alcohol in moderation without causing significant harm to themselves or others. On the other hand, you will be hard pressed to find almost anyone who uses crack in moderation. A rather slippery slope type argument, first crack, then booze, then smokes, then coffee, then artificial sweetners...etc. There are many things which cause harm to people, banning all is not practicle, nor is it possible.",

   "It would lead ultimately down the road to a marriage bill for polygamists. That is why the current push for a Constitutional Amendment to ban gay marriage also contains a provision banning polygamous marriage as well.\n \n Hmm....some opposition to the petition...More left wing ideology at work.\n\n \n \n Hmm. Interesting that you should bring up the topic of polegamy. The OT is a frequently used as a basis for condemnation of homosexuality. So let us consider what the OT has to say on the topic of polygamy. \n \n This morning in my scripture reading I happened across the story of Jacob and his search for a wife, after cheating Esau out of his birth right (Genesis 29 & 30). If you will recall, Jacob was attracted to his first cousin Rachel, but he was tricked by his Uncle Laban into marrying his first cousin Leah. When Jacob discovered he had been had, he insisted on having Rachel as well. \n \n So not only did Jacob enter into a polygamous marriage, but his wives were sisters who also happened to be close relatives. \n \n When Rachel turned out to be barren she gave her maid to Jacob saying,\" Here is my maid Bilah, go into her , that she may bear on my knees, that through her I too may have children.\" So Rachel's maid sits on her lap through labor and childbirth and Rachel pretends she is giving birth. Not to be outdone, in chapter 30 verse 9 Leah gaves her maid Zilpah to Jacob for sexual intercourse and she bears him a child. \n \n I don't know about anyone else but this whole arrangement strikes me as pretty icky. It would break numerous cultural taboos in the US yet it was clearly acceptable to God. God did not punish Jacob for this marriage and for having sex with his wife's maid but rather blesses him (See verse 25) In Genesis Chapter 30 verses 18-20 Leah says that God specifically blessed her for sending her maid into Jacob.\n \n Just some quick thoughts and queries.\n 1. In light of the aforementioned arrangement a monogamous marriage between two loving people of the same sex seems down right conservative.\n 2. No where in the OT is female homosexuality forbidden. Why would female homosexuality be acceptable in the OT but forbidden in the NT?\n 3.The NT reference in I Corinthians 6:9 that many translate as homosexual are the words, Malakos (soft, fine or feminine) and Arsenokoites (literally Arsen- man man Koites - couch) The NT reference in Timothy is also Arseokoites. No mention of female homosexuality in either of these two verses.\n 4. Romans 1: 26-27, Paul is addressing the pagan temple sex rituals that heterosexuals are engaging in as a form of idolatry. In this context it is heterosexuals engaging in orgiastic homosexual sexual acts for the purpose of worshiping false Gods that Paul is addressing, not faithful monogamous gay couples. These verses are a far cry from a clear prohibition on monogamous homosexual relationships. \n 5. You cannot ban gay marriage as long as any pastor is willing to peform the ceremony. You can only ban recognition of gay marriage by a government entity. \n 6. Christ said that , \"whomever divorces his wife, except for immorality and marries another woman commits adultry. I wonder how many of the 800 signatures on your pettion are people who are on their second marriage. How many heterosexual people do you know who are on their second marriage? If you want to protect the sanctity of heterosexual marriage why not a petition for a constitutional ban on divorce except for immorality and/ or a constitutional ban on adultry?\n 9. Matt 7:5 \"You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye.\"",

For more than 200 years in this country \"everyone\" knew the difference of right from wrong - and those that chose to do wrong were too ashamed to admit it.\n\n \n Ohhh- like slave owners, and people who burned \"witches\", and lynched blacks and massacred Native Americans and/or ran them off there land, and put Japanese Americans in concentration camps knew right from wrong?\n \n \nAll of a sudden in the last 10 years they are trying to convice us that homosexuality is not \"wrong\" its a \"choice\"\n\n \n Actually the majority of homosexuals will tell you it's not a choice. And I, being the wacky gal I am, have a tendency to believe the word of homosexuals on that particular subject over the word of straight neonazicons.\n \n \nBy that logic, some day murder will be a free choice (actually it already is in the case of abortion)\n\n \n Murder creates victims. One could even make that argument for abortion. You can't for homosexuality.

TV shows, movies, magazines, etc. are loaded with gay characters as an agenda to make you accept them. Don't buy it! Write to the media and tell them you won't stand for it.\n\n \n Actually I really don't depend on the entertainment industry to give me a realistic picture of anything. I highly recommend you don't, either. What I know about gay people is from knowing gay people.\n \n \nIf we allow such thigs as gay marriage, other things will follow. (including polagamy, and marriage of children) Yes, its shocking, but these things seep in little by little. Imagine how shocked our founding fathers would be to read this discussion we have here!\n\n \n What is shocking is your willingness to buy into fallacy. Marriage to children/sexual molestation of children creates victims. Pologamy - as long as everyone is a consenting adult I really don't care. I know what is and is not my business.\n \n \nHomosexuals dont need to mess with marriage. If they want to be together, they can call it something else. Marriage is the union of one MAN and one WOMAN.\n\n \n Marriage is and has been many things - depending on what people at any given period of time found convenient.\n \n \n(isnt it obvious - if you cant create a child together - its abnormal!)\n\n \n What in the hell does that have to do with it? Must all married people reproduce like bunnies? And, I am can ASSURE you, marriage is not required for procreation.\n \n \nHomosexuals cant stay together anyway. the average is HUNDREDS of partners in a lifetime! So why would they want this when most will divorce soon afterward as they have already proven!!\n\n \n All that is proven here is your prejudice. I bet you don't even know gay people. Sure there are promiscious gays. Same as straight folk. If the sexual exploits of Dennis Rodman and the Gene Simmonds do not keep us from barring committed heterosexuals to marry, why should the acts of promiscious gays bar marriage to committed homosexuals?\n \n My son's mentor and his partner have been committed for 18 years. I know another gay couple who have been together for five, and two lesbian couples who have been together for about 12-15 years.\n \n \nEvery child needs a mom and dad if at all possible. Research has proven this. Our prisons are full of children with no fathers in their lives!! Two moms or two dads has never been proven necessary.\n\n \n You might want to consider talking to the children of gay people about their parents. You could start with mine.
