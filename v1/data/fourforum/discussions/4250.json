   "i think technology, as well as any other type of \"civil progress\" creates new problems to about the same extent as it solves. the thing is, this has nothing to do with the technology itself, which can neither be good or bad, but with the human condition of greed, discontent, laziness and curiousity. technology helps to accelerate the development of new technology, which in turn accelerates again, creating an exponential curve in development. this is also spurred by an exponential growth in human greed, discontent, laziness and curiousity.\n \n depending on what you value, this question can be answered either way. i personally prefer the \"good ol' days\" of less technology and more manual labour, less luxury and more elementary skill building and communialism. and of course i can easily imagine people that would prefer exactly the opposite. it depends on your perspective. i can elaborate on mine later",

   "What do u think ? Let me know\n\n \n I agree with the big man, Big Orn.\n \n Even the last statement. Technology doesn't literally \"save time\", it simply enhances efficiency, and time continues to march on. \n \n An to the point, no, it doesn't create more problems than it solves. Knowledge is the same way. The more you know, the more you know you don't know. Yet you still net more knowledge...\n \n Knowledge and technology are incable of creating problems without human intervention. It's that human intervention that we can deem good, bad, or ugly :)\n \n -Mach",
