Not that it hasn't been a good show since then or that it's had its moments, but it hasn't had the greatness it once had. Except for the loss of Leo. NBC couldn't really help that.\n \n You're right. It did change the mind and challenge you to think. I miss that.\n \n Thankfully, Aaron Sorkin and Thomas Schlamme are developing a new show called \"Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip.\" It's going to have several of the West Wing cast members including Bradley Whitford as the lead. I just wish they had brought the woman that plays Donna along too.",
