That thread got off topic really quickly, so I would ask that any replies be narrowly focused on the story below regarding the actions of the South Dakota House. With that ground-rule laid, what do people think? This is clearly a challenge to Roe, will the strategy work?",

Doctors who do those abortions could not be prosecuted.\n\n \n http://www.keloland.com/NewsDetail2817.cfm?Id=0,45916",

The question is, are there enough justices on the Supreme Court who would reverse the judge-made Constitutional Amendment which granted an absolute right to abortion.\n\n \n If you're referring to the 1973 U.S. Supreme Panel of Justices, it can be reversed, with the right legal counsel. Since Roe vs. Wade men across this country have gone to prison for killing the same fetus a woman has a right to kill. The fetus has remained constant nothing has changed with the fetus, the only thing not constant are the \"rights\" of father and mother. \n \n \n \nThis would not solve the problem as there would be many out there who would claim that they cannot be told what to do with their own property when artificial wombs are available just like they can't be told what to do with their own property when artificial wombs aren't available.\n\n \n If the arguement is that a fetus is not human and therefore is property it can be argued that the creation of property was jointly made and joint ownership should be duly given. In the event a fetus is human in nature, then it can be said that humans cannot be owned, or should we go back to the days of slavery. Humans owning humans. \n \n Women if they decide to relinquish their right to parenthood, the father should have EQUAL say in raising his child in an artifiical womb. A woman must not have 100% say to the future of the unborn when she wasn't sole creator, if she elects to go to the doctor to remove it, so let her, with the artificial womb, and with science, removing an embryo and transferring it to an artificial womb is no more or no less intrusive into the womans body. Think about it, if a woman wants to go for an abortion and the doctor extracts the baby, and is holding the alive baby in his hands, the mother is no longer in possession of the baby and the \"rights\" of the father must be acknowleged. With the artificial womb, once an embyo is taken out of the woman alive, it is BORN, no matter the premature age, and it is a american citizen with the same rights as you and I.\n \n \n \nThere really is nothing wrong with the States posessing power. In fact, it is quite in line with the Constitution if the States really did have more power than the Federal Government, which by the way, I do not believe is the case today.\n\n \n The States have \"unleashed\" power, which is more powerful than the Federal Government. A Governor is elected to represent \"his/her\" people, not that of the neighboring state. In theory, lets assume 75% of the citizens in South Dakota were backing legislation of banning abortions, and one woman tries to sue to make it legal again, and the state denys her, so she takes it to the US Supreme Court and they say, S. Dakota is wrong and must reverse their decision. South Dakota DOES NOT have to do anything but stand strong and stand alone with their people. The Governor can tell the Federal Government they have no jurisdiction in S. Dakota, and you can take your federal dollars and shove em. What is the federal goverment to do? Marshall law on S. Dakota? I don't think so. S. Dakota can say we're no longer part of the United State and is now a Country by itself. What would the Feds do then? Re-read the history books? Well, things have changed since then, and neighboring states may even sympathize with S. Dakota and be on their side, especially the mid-west who have similiar values with their conservative neighboring states as opposed to the liberal coastal states, whose values seem to stamped those in the mid-west.\n \n States have so much \"unleashed\" power but rarely use it.",
