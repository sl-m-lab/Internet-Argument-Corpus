   "1. Do you really believe that Noah was 500 years old when he fathered his first child? (Gen 5:32)\n\n if the bible said so, why wouldnt it be true?\n \n2. Why was it ok for God to destroy the sinful city of Sodom, but not ok to destroy Lot's daughters when they have sex with him? (Gen 19:30-36)\n\n actually, the children of the daughters of lot (the moabites and the ammonites), were cursed by God. later the nation of israel were ordered by God to completely wipe out these tribes\n \n3. Do you really believe that anyone who works on the sabbath should be killed? (Exodus 31:15)\n\n the commandment is actually to keep the sabbath holy. doing good on the sabbath, even if it involves labor, was in accordance with the the commandment\n \n4. Do you believe that children should be put to death for the sins of their parents? (2 Samuel 2:2-4, 14-27; 12:9-19)\n\n well they were, because of the belief in generational curses. it stems from the concept of the original sin. since adam and eve disobeyed God, the sin of disobedience is inherited through all people. following this logic, if your dad was an idolator, that sin would also be in his children, and so on for that entire lineage, so they had to be cut off.\n \n5. How come God rewarded Abraham and Lot with earthkly riches but Jesus said that wealth is a one way ticket to hell? (Gen 24:34-35; Job 42:10-12; Matt 19:24)\n\n jesus never said that riches is a one way ticket to hell. he said it is extremely difficuklt for the rich to enter heaven, but not that riches are evil\n \n6. Do you believe in slavery? Then why do the apostles Paul and Peter encourage slaves to be obedient? (Eph 6:5-7; Peter 3:18)\n\n a \"slave\" in the context was a \"bondservant\", which was someone that either owed a debt and had to pay it back in work, or a person that offered to serve another out of obligation or gratitude or whatever the reason. this could also refer to any type of internship or apprentice relationship. it didnt mean that people didnt work for salaries back then.\n \n the borrower is slave to the lender. true now as it was then\n \n \n is this the best ken could come up with... lol",

IF YOU WILL STUDY THESE THINGS, you will see that only God executes capital punishment in the New Testament.\n \n Secondly, God's moral laws have not changed from the Old Testament.

Now we can see that there was no Montana or Peggy Creek 700 years ago, nor was the craft he was in called a boat. See what I mean?

Call it apologetics if you wish, I call it explanation.\n \nSo the bible is contaminated and abused?\n Where is the contamination? \n Can you point some of it out to me?\n\n A couple will suffice: The Crusades; the Inquisitions...\n \nAnd which Bible do you use?\n The Catholic Bible, the Orthodox one, a protestant one?\n\n The Holy Bible.

   "This kind of tacky question reminds me of a convention of Christians from many denominations. The host asked, \"What denomination are you?\" 50,000 people all responded with their different denominations. Then the host asked, \"Who is your Lord and Savior?\" Unanimously they all yelled back, \"Jesus\"!!!\n \n Trebor, you can't see the forest for the trees, dude....\n\n \n \n Come on now, it's a salvation issue, isn't it? After all, the current pope has declared that anybody who doesn't follow roman catholoism goes to that big bbq pit. \n \n And, I keep on hearing southern baptists claim catholics aren't true christians.\n \n And then there is that nasty fact that the Protestants rejected several books of the bible.",
