It is a history of wickedness that has served to corrupt and brutalize mankind; and, for my part, I sincerely detest it, as I detest everything that is cruel\"\n\n Hi Tim, I'm assuming that you agree with the person who you are quoting so I will try to base my reply around that. I've heard it said countless times that the God of the old Testament was a cruel God but the God of the new Testament was kind and loving God, the thing is they are both the same. It would be fair to point out that Moses acted in this way in response to divine command (Num. 31:1,2). This is proof that God is very protective over his people, and will continue to be very protective over them in the very near future. If this action was not taken then God's chosen people would have been overrun with false worship, idolatry, immorality and so on, and would have thwarted God's promise to his people to give them the land. Also noteworthy to point out is that nearly three centuries later the midianites recovered from this still to attack Gods people (compare Jg. 6:1; 11:25,26)\n The thing is if God claims to be a Judge of all mankind then one would surely expect some acts of judgement to follow, Correct. Only God can judge in perfect righteousness as the conversation between himself and Abraham would indicate at Genesis 18:23-26.23 Then Abraham approached and began to say: \"Will you really sweep away the righteous with the wicked? 24 Suppose there are fifty righteous men in the midst of the city. Will you, then, sweep them away and not pardon the place for the sake of the fifty righteous who are inside it? 25 It is unthinkable of you that you are acting in this manner to put to death the righteous man with the wicked one so that it has to occur with the righteous man as it does with the wicked! It is unthinkable of you. Is the Judge of all the earth not going to do what is right?\" 26 Then Jehovah said: \"If I shall find in Sod'om fifty righteous men in the midst of the city I will pardon the whole place on their account.\" \n So we can begin to see the real person of God a righteous judge not a willful murderer. Also it may be fair to point out that Christians don't believe in ethnic cleansing or genocide the way that you are attempting to present this case, but do back up God in his acts of righteous judgement. The whole claim of rape has no scriptual foundation either nowhere has God ever commissioned these vial acts.",

Read the account Dinah's consent was circumstantial. They litterally felt he defiled Isreal. The person that actually had the power to give consent was her father Jacob. Since the family of the virgin's had to be killed I assume Moses took the patriarchal role and gave consent for them. It was a totally different culture. Also Dinah's brothers were going against their father's word by killing them.\n \n *** Rbi8 Genesis 34:8-19 ***\n \n 8*And Ha'mor proceeded to speak with them, saying: \"As for She'chem my son, his soul is attached to YOUR daughter. Give her, please, to him as a wife, 9*and form marriage alliances with us. YOUR daughters YOU are to give to us, and our daughters YOU are to take for yourselves. 10*And with us YOU may dwell, and the land will become available for YOU. Dwell and carry on business in it and get settled in it.\" 11*Then She'chem said to her father and to her brothers: \"Let me find favor in YOUR eyes, and whatever YOU will say to me I shall give it. 12*Raise very high the marriage money and gift imposed upon me, and I stand willing to give according to what YOU may say to me; only give me the young woman as a wife.\"\n \n 13*And Jacob's sons began to answer She'chem and Ha'mor his father with deceit and to speak so because he had defiled Di'nah their sister. 14*And they went on to say to them: \"We cannot possibly do such a thing, to give our sister to a man who has a foreskin, because that is a reproach to us. 15*Only on this condition can we give consent to YOU, that YOU become like us, by every male of YOURS getting circumcised. 16*Then we shall certainly give our daughters to YOU, and YOUR daughters we shall take for ourselves, and we shall certainly dwell with YOU and become one people. 17*But if YOU do not listen to us to get circumcised, then we will take our daughter and go.\"\n \n 18*And their words seemed good in the eyes of Ha'mor and in the eyes of She'chem, Ha'mor's son, 19*and the young man did not delay to perform the condition, because he did find delight in Jacob's daughter and he was the most honorable of the whole house of his father.",
