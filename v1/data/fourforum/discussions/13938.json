   "\n \n The point I am making is that there isn't any difference between believing in Santa or, believing in God - it's all in your head.\n\n \n Sorry, that doesn't fly.\n \n First of all, Jesus is presented as an historical figure by reputable people in both secular and sacred historical writings. Santa Claus is simply presented as a fictional character.\n \n Second, Jesus is presented as a real person who claimed to be divine and who performed miracles. These accounts are attested to by reputable witnesses and have been transmitted to us reliably; the New Testament documents are 99.5% textually pure. Santa Claus is intentionally, and knowingly, presented as a fictional character who lives at the North Pole.\n \n Third, the intention of the gospel writers was to convey the physical reality of Jesus to responsible adults, whereas the accounts of Santa are intended to entertain the wild imaginations of children. This is why the vast majority of healthy, mentally competent adults do not believe in a real person known as Santa who can travel through air being pulled by several flying reindeer, who can carry in his sled enough presents for all the good children in the entire world, and who can descend and ascend through chimneys even though he is quite overweight.1\n \n Fourth, the writings concerning Jesus exhibit an historical, cultural, religious, and political context with verifiable names, events, and places being an integral part of the record of that context and reality. Santa Claus stories do not contain any such integral contextualization, except to state that there is a North Pole and that there are cities and countries where Santa visits at night.\n \n Fifth, the facts are that parents buy, wrap, and deliver presents to children, and we know of no documented occurrences where Santa Claus has been caught breaking and entering, tripping home alarm systems, caught on film, vanishing up a chimney, and riding a sleigh through the air pulled by flying reindeer. This latter point is worth a comment, since we additionally have no evidence at all that reindeer can fly. This further adds to the irrationality of the Santa Claus story. Additionally, if a large sleigh (sufficient to carry millions of toys) approached the Washington D.C. area (surely there are at least some good children there), we would expect to hear of military fighter jets being scrambled to intercept the intruder. No records of this have yet surfaced.\n \n Sixth, given that the gospel accounts were written by individuals who knew Jesus personally (or were under the guidance of those who knew Him), that the gospels are historically accurate, superbly transmitted to us through the copying method, we can then assume at the very least that Jesus was an actual historical person. But, we have no hard evidence to establish the validity of Santa Claus. We have found no reindeer tracks on the roofs of millions of snow-covered homes on Christmas Eve. There are no video accounts of Santa roaming throughout peoples' homes. We know of no flying reindeer, and no one has yet established how Santa can live at the North Pole for hundreds of years without being detected -- particularly in this technologically advanced culture. Add to that the lack of Santa Disciples going about the world, risking their lives, being ridiculed by religious and political adversaries, writing inspirational text, performing miracles, etc., and you really don't have much evidence at all that Santa exists, except in the minds of children.\n \n Finally, it really comes down to whether or not either one can reasonably be proven to exist. Very few people deny the historic reality of Jesus, and though millions of children affirm the existence of Santa, we know well that the minds of children are not capable of differentiating between fantasy and reality -- particularly when the parents they are trusting tell them Santa is real.\n \n For an atheist to reject Jesus' existence based on arguments found against Santa Claus demonstrates the inability for the atheist to distinguish between historical, verifiable documents and known, constructed childrens' stories.

   "Sorry, that doesn't fly.\n\n \n \n Nor does half of what you have below\n \n \nFirst of all, Jesus is presented as an historical figure by reputable people in both secular and sacred historical writings. Santa Claus is simply presented as a fictional character.\n\n \n Jesus - Well sort of\n Santa - Don't be to hard on Santa Christians have put forth a lot of effort to equate him with St. Nick\n \n \n \nSecond, Jesus is presented as a real person who claimed to be divine and who performed miracles. These accounts are attested to by reputable witnesses and have been transmitted to us reliably; the New Testament documents are 99.5% textually pure. Santa Claus is intentionally, and knowingly, presented as a fictional character who lives at the North Pole.\n\n \n 99.5% textually pure. Textually pure to exactly what? The originals? The copies in existence? The copies of the accepted Canon which were hoped to be correct?\n \n See how many presents you get next xmas, but there is time to repent.\n \n \nThird, the intention of the gospel writers was to convey the physical reality of Jesus to responsible adults, whereas the accounts of Santa are intended to entertain the wild imaginations of children. This is why the vast majority of healthy, mentally competent adults do not believe in a real person known as Santa who can travel through air being pulled by several flying reindeer, who can carry in his sled enough presents for all the good children in the entire world, and who can descend and ascend through chimneys even though he is quite overweight.1\n\n \n I don't know responsible was actually necessary.\n \n You got something against overweight people? You try jogging at the North Pole\n \n \n \nFourth, the writings concerning Jesus exhibit an historical, cultural, religious, and political context with verifiable names, events, and places being an integral part of the record of that context and reality. Santa Claus stories do not contain any such integral contextualization, except to state that there is a North Pole and that there are cities and countries where Santa visits at night.\n\n \n Are you suggesting the North Pole is not a real place? Would you agree that the inclusion of facts does not automatically make an account true in it's entirety. Meaning because there are tornadoes in Kansas doesn't mean there is a wizard of Oz\n \n \nFifth, the facts are that parents buy, wrap, and deliver presents to children, and we know of no documented occurrences where Santa Claus has been caught breaking and entering, tripping home alarm systems, caught on film, vanishing up a chimney, and riding a sleigh through the air pulled by flying reindeer. This latter point is worth a comment, since we additionally have no evidence at all that reindeer can fly. This further adds to the irrationality of the Santa Claus story. Additionally, if a large sleigh (sufficient to carry millions of toys) approached the Washington D.C. area (surely there are at least some good children there), we would expect to hear of military fighter jets being scrambled to intercept the intruder. No records of this have yet surfaced.\n\n \n Santa is awesome huh. Of course someone flew a jet into the pentagon without jets scrambling so I don't know how good an example that is.\n \n [QUOTE=Easyrider;391771]Sixth, given that the gospel accounts were written by individuals who knew Jesus personally (or were under the guidance of those who knew Him), \n \n Is believed by Christians (most) and Luke fits in there how?\n \n \nthat the gospels are historically accurate, superbly transmitted to us through the copying method, we can then assume at the very least that Jesus was an actual historical person.\n\n \n I disagree with how you arrive to your conclusion, but will agree with it.\n \n \nBut, we have no hard evidence to establish the validity of Santa Claus. We have found no reindeer tracks on the roofs of millions of snow-covered homes on Christmas Eve. There are no video accounts of Santa roaming throughout peoples' homes. We know of no flying reindeer, and no one has yet established how Santa can live at the North Pole for hundreds of years without being detected -- particularly in this technologically advanced culture. Add to that the lack of Santa Disciples going about the world, risking their lives, being ridiculed by religious and political adversaries, writing inspirational text, performing miracles, etc., and you really don't have much evidence at all that Santa exists, except in the minds of children.\n\n \n \n Hallmark\n \n And if Jesus can do it why not Santa? Would x-mas be what it is without the belief that he exists? Why does Santa have to be physical and Jesus not?\n \n \nFinally, it really comes down to whether or not either one can reasonably be proven to exist. Very few people deny the historic reality of Jesus, and though millions of children affirm the existence of Santa, we know well that the minds of children are not capable of differentiating between fantasy and reality -- particularly when the parents they are trusting tell them Santa is real.\n\n \n So would it be fair to say as you grew older you lost your faith in Santa? \n \n \nFor an atheist to reject Jesus' existence based on arguments found against Santa Claus demonstrates the inability for the atheist to distinguish between historical, verifiable documents and known, constructed childrens' stories. Jesus was an actual historical figure. Santa, of course, is not.\n\n \n Most atheist don't argue that Jesus, a person, didn't exist, but that God doesn't exist and that makes it hard for Jesus to be the son of God as well as God. To an atheist the belief in a caring fat man who brings joy to those who believe in him that nobody can see is very similar to a caring skinny man who brings joy to those who believe in him that nobody can see. Which would imply that at least one Christian can't understand what he is arguing about.",

What is reasonable evidence for faith for me, is not accepted by you, therefore simply because you or the rest of the gang feel faith is baseless, that is your subjective opinion, and not the definition of 'false', per se.\n \n \nAnd just to get picky, why does the belief in God mean that you have to believe that Jesus is God? Jews believe in God, but not in Jesus. The same can be said of many other religions.\n\n \n What 'many other religions' believe in God? Are you suggesting that all religions believe in the same? I am referring specifically to the God of Abraham and, notwithstanding the fact that the Jews do not believe in Christ, that's their problem. I said 'if follows that' I did not say 'one must believe'. \n  Obviously Christians believe in Christ.\n \n \nIt appears that you are the one making the assumptions here.\n\n \n Wouldn't expect You to see it any other way.emoticon_rolleyes",

   "Wow, I like the way this discussion continued after I left. :)\n \n Santa has his roots in religion: \n Santa Claus Facts, Origins, Christmas celebration in different countries, and fun Tidbits\n The Easter Bunny has his roots in religion, also: \n The History of Easter and the Easter Bunny\n \n So, don't be too quick to dismiss them.\n \n I'm obviously out of practice with debating and I remember now why I got away from it - far too time consuming. \n \n The reason for starting this thread was that I am honestly curious as to why humans feel the need to believe in things that are not of this world.\n I didn't want to get into my personal business and I still don't but, it's hard for me to make a point without doing so...but, I don't see any way around it. \n \n Before thoroughly embracing the Christian religion which turned me into a raving zealot complete with all of the memorized bible quotes and apologetics, I had always been curious about and open minded to the possibility of 'God'.\n I read about Eastern philosophy, studied meditation and at one point believed that I was very close to 'enlightenment'...but, something happened and 'poof' the feeling was gone.\n \n Years passed with no real religious activity on my part. Those years were rough and I was near rock bottom and desperate for help when I started reading my bible, praying and memorizing certain verses to chant to myself when things were especially tough.\n \n It was a miracle! I started to feel better and I made a conscious decision to quit drinking...and I did - just like that, with not another thought about it since.\n For about 3-4 years, this went on, trying to be a 'good Christian' (what I thought was a good Christian because after seeing all the arguments from Christians on internet forums, about just what that was, I figured my belief was just as valid as theirs).\n \n I can't say exactly when I stopped 'believing'. There was no special event, no major disappointment that turned me away for a belief in a God, it just gradually happened.\n \n And here I am. I am the same person I have always been - minus an obsession with a God. \n I have had some tough times that could have been used as an excuse to blot out reality with booze but, I haven't. In fact, I often go to the liquor store to buy something for my pastry recipes and never once has it occurred to me or, have I had the urge to drink any. I tell myself (and anyone who asks, that I am allergic - and, in reality, I am because I have a terrible reaction to it. ;) )\n \n The point is, I feel stronger now than I did when I was a 'Christian. I am more aware of the world around me and I feel certain that I alone am responsible for what goes on in my life.\n \n When a storm is approaching, I don't look towards the heavens and pray, 'Oh God, help me', I just go to my storm shelter and hope the storm passes me by.\n If the weather conditions are ripe for a tornado to form in my neck of the woods, it's gonna happen - because that's the way nature works. if it passes me by, it's not because God pushed it out of the way and if it hits it's not because 'He' allowed it to happen - it's just the weather.\n \n There are so many contradictions and absurdities that occur when you decide to give 'God' credit for everything. If both the Titans and San Fransisco pray to win the ball game, and the Titans win, does that mean that San Fransisco didn't deserve to win, according to 'Gods Plan'?\n \n I know the argument: God has a plan, even though we don't know what it is or, understand it.\n Rubbish.\n If the Titans win, it's because they have a better team and play the game better than their opponent.\n \n So, back to the original question: Why do some (a lot) of humans feel the need to believe in something that does not exist in this reality?\n Why do they need to believe that someone bigger and better and omnipotent and omniscient has to be in control?\n Everything that happens in this universe can be explained, there is always a reasonable explanation.\n Why is it so hard to believe that We are in control of what happens in our universe?\n \n The day I made a conscious decision to stop drinking was the day my life began to improve and all the years of misery were my own doing, also. It wasn't the prayers or, the bible-reading but, my own determination and willpower. I give credit where credit is due. At the time, I thought it was God, but, now I know that all I had to do was decide for myself.",

Beside, God is of this world to the extent that He owns it, He created it and He is ultimately in control of it. Also, why do you believe that just because God isn't real to you, that He isn't real at all? How arrogant is it of you to assume that just because you haven't experienced Him in a real and personal way that He must not exist at all? \n \n I say this because I'm here to tell you that I have experienced Him in a real and personal way, so I know beyond any doubt at all that my God, the God of Israel, Yahweh, El-Shadai and Jehovah-Jireh is a loving and personal Father who wishes that none should perish but all of us should come to a personal knowledge of Him and fellowship with Him which is why He created us originally.

   "Matthew 7-1 Judge not, that ye be not judged.\n \n And here's the rest of the story:\n \n \"Judge not, and you will not be judged.\" (Matthew 7:1)\n \n Jesus is not saying that we cannot make judgments about people, he is saying that we should not be hypocrites if we do. In Matthew 7:5 he says, \"You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck that is in your brothers eye.\"\n \n God acknowledges the legitimacy of civil authorities to judge: \n \n Romans 13:1-4: \"Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. (v. 4) For he (the reigning authority) is God's servant to do you good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword for nothing. He is God's servant, an agent of God's wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.\" (Also note Matthew 5:25; Acts 25:10-11)\n \n God has commanded the church to make correct judgments:\n \n John 7:24: \"Stop judging by mere appearances, and make a right judgment.\"\n \n Matthew 18:15-17: \"If your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over. But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses (note Deuteronomy 19:15). If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector .\"\n \n God commands us to judge according to one's 'fruits.'\n \n Matthew 7:17-20: \"Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.....every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them.\"\n \n Saints of Christ will judge the world, and angels:\n \n I Corinthians 6:2: \"Do you not know that the saints will judge the world?\"\n \n I Corinthians 6:3: \"Do you not know that we will judge angels?\"\n \n Jesus condemned the teachers of the law and the Pharisees:\n \n Matthew 23:27-28: \"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean. In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.\"\n \n John the Baptist rebukes King Herod for adultery and other sins:\n \n Luke 3:19: \"But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of Herodias, his brother's wife, and all the other things he had done, Herod added this to them all: He locked John up in prison.\" \n \n Stephen rebukes the Jewish leaders:\n \n Acts 7:51-53: \"You stiff-necked people, with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You are just like your fathers: You always resist the Holy Spirit! Was there ever a prophet your fathers did not persecute? They even killed those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One. And now you have betrayed and murdered him - you who have received the law that was put into effect through angels but have not obeyed it.\" \n \n Also note all the Old Testament prophets who condemned sin and corrupt moral leadership, and who were persecuted for their discernment and duty.\n \n Finally, when someone accuses you of being judgmental, are they not being critical and judgmental in making that accusation?",

Let no one disregard you.\n And Jesus never pulled punches when He was correcting someone, even his own disciples, here's an example:\n Mat 16:21 From that time Jesus began to show His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised up on the third day.\n Mat 16:22 Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, \"God forbid it, Lord! This shall never happen to You.\"\n Mat 16:23 But He turned and said to Peter, \"Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me; for you are not setting your mind on God's interests, but man's.\"\n What is aggravating me about JPs assertion that it is I who is guilty of insensitivity here is the fact that Sandycane has seen fit to start a thread which JP should clearly see as a baiting and dishonest thread. I would also like to see quotes of me personally attacking anyone here rather than exposing the weakness in his/their arguments. I realize that my directness and inability to compromise my beliefs can be frustrating for some to bear around here, but that doesn't mean that I should not challenge those according to the truths I know to be true when they insist they are walking in them but are NOT. To do less than be bold in correcting them would be lying according to Gods value system. And one more thing which is worth clarifying as it explains why I'm being criticized:\n Jhn 3:3 Jesus answered and said to him, \"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.\"\n Jhn 3:7 \"Do not be amazed that I said to you, 'You must be born again.'\n 1Pe 1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,\n 1Pe 1:23 for you have been born again not of seed which is perishable but imperishable, {that is,} through the living and enduring word of God.\n Again, any gentile born into a catholic or protestant family today labels themselves a \"christian\", and culturally speaking they are of christian descent. But Jesus was very clear that His salvation is not cultural but personal as it requires a personal commitment from us to Him. This is what Esdraelon was saying above and he was absolutely correct as he was correct regarding our responsibility to reprove people like Jason who pervert such truths in the bible about his corrupted interpretation of the homosexual passages in order to justify his lifestyle.\n \n I mean, my only argument to him has always been that it is a perversion of the truth to say that homosexuals needn't repent, or turn away from their predominant sin as every other believer must do upon receiving Christ. It should be stressed that when I first came to 4forums, the general belief was that homosexuals could never be saved and were automatically damned according to the christian faith. It is only Archangel who originally made the distinction that Jesus died for all of us, including homosexuals, but I wont compromise the truth to allow them to avoid repentance of their predominant sin. \n \n With that said, my truth may be difficult to take, but it isn't in anyway a personal attack against Jason or anybody else I debate here. But if you will go to any of Jason's posts to me and objectively read them, you will see nothing but personal attacks as he labels me a bigot a homophobe and various other insulting adjectives for daring to correct him according to the bible he claims to also trust and respect. I must ask, why doesn't JP hold this self professing christian to the same standards he is holding me to? This Proverb remains absolutely true in spite of Jason's objections because it perfectly applies to his rejection of the truth he claims to hold to.

The example Jesus gives in the Bible is rarely one of anger, even at times when it may be warranted. He does not back off and would go so far as to say even provoked in order to make a point. You don't have to accept any evidence that suggests what you view as truth may not be, but the opposite is also true. When I talk about a standard that you have chosen that is the standard set by Jesus for Christians. I believe he said somewhere something to the effect that following in his footsteps may not be the easiest path, but that is a price I assume you are willing to pay. Jesus managed to get his point across without turning a blind eye and without bashing everyone who didn't think like him. I mean really the only thing that ever really pixxed him off was the fig tree.\n \n What I meant by turning on and off is that some people here haven't chosen to play by the same rules you have by being Christian. That doesn't effect the degree with which you defend your faith, but it does effect the means by which you do so. I am not saying it's fair, but accepting your rules isn't a condition of playing, but is a condition of your faith. When you abandon your self imposed rules your setting aside a part of your faith in order to defend it. It's not my call, but yours alone if that is how you want to play.\n \n I can understand your frustration on both fronts having served mine to you and received yours myself, but me doing so doesn't conflict with my beliefs.",

If you knew the bible as you say, then you would know that we are all sinners in need of salvation and determining that you don't doesn't change the fact from Gods perspective. And let's face it, Gods perspective will be the only one that counts when all is said and done. Here's what I mean, read carefully because you should already be aware of this spiritual truth unless you're lying about your history as a believer in Christ.\n Rom 3:23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,\n Rom 3:24 being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus;\n Only lovers of the darkness which wars with Gods truths would be offended by people who speak of receiving a free gift of salvation which God tells us we cannot earn but must only receive it freely by grace. What you find hateful or steeped in fear by a gospel which was given to free us from the bondage of sin and actually gives us liberty in Christ just boggles my mind and reveals what you truly represent with your shallow lies and vacuous defense of the spiritual darkness you cling so tightly to.\n \n Here's what I mean about the bondage of sin:\n Gal 4:3 So also we, while we were children, were held in bondage under the elemental things of the world.\n Gal 4:4 But when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the Law,\n Gal 4:5 so that He might redeem those who were under the Law, that we might receive the adoption as sons.\n And the liberty found only in Christ:Rom 8:20 For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of Him who subjected [it] in hope;\n Rom 8:21 because the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.\n Since I have been delivered into liberty from the bondage of sin and separation from God, I have no fear or need to elevate myself above unrepentant sinners who have no such benefit of the security which only comes with a personal relationship with the living God of life. And if you ever actually knew Him as you claim to have, you would know this already. \n \n So stop posing as a believer who found freedom from God and just admit that you're a liar who needs to claim this knowledge for credibility in your false attacks and lies against Gods truths. And believe me, I will be here to remind you of your lies overtime you attempt to claim you once knew the truth.",

He then accuses everyone who acknowledges his old car as delusional and says their belief in it is all in their mind. Can you appreciate that those people who personally experienced his first car would call him a blatant liar and crazy for denying it now existed?\n \n This is why I know that you are lying about ever having had a personal relationship with God through Christ and you are a religious poser, because if you had one, you would never deny such a holy and intimate personal relationship which comes with personally knowing Him. In other words my deceived friend, life in Christ is real and tangible and never ending for those who have truly experienced it. This claim that its all in my mind is the big lie which belies your claim to have ever had what I have in God through Christ Jesus our Lord. \n \n And you notice how I refer to Him as \"OUR\" Lord?

I hold scriptural views as superior to fallen Mans, and correcting your perversion of Gods word as you attempt to justify homosexuality which He condemns is not judging you but correcting your error which will ultimately condemn you. How is that act on my part not an expression of extreme love on my part? \n \n Oh wait, you don't seek Gods truth at all but to simply reinforce that corruption of His word which feeds your fleshly lusts as a homosexual. \n \n \nYou are also people who pass unwarranted judgment on others who have sensitive beliefs and ideals just like you...\n\n \n My judgments on your sinful lifestyle which God condemns in His word is totally justified since you spend half of your posts demanding, no, insisting that you too are a born again believer who has accepted Christ as your personal savior. If that is true Jason, then how can you continue to crucify Him with every homosexual indiscretion you participate in? Here's what I mean, from the bible:\n Hbr 6:4 For [it is] impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit,\n Hbr 6:5 and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come,\n Hbr 6:6 if they fall away, [fn] to renew them again to repentance, since they crucify again for themselves the Son of God, and put [Him] to an open shame. \n Rom 8:5 For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.\n Rom 8:6 For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.\n \nI won't bother with more of your scold the child Bull like I'm incapable of understanding your views. I know them all too well, your ploys, motives, and little bitter entanglements you entrap yourself in on this board.\n\n \n See, there you go again. Look at how you reinterpret what I say by referring to them as my views when you know very well they are the scriptural views which your own father and his church elders have taught you. By your very homosexual blindness and need for justification of this perversion of the flesh, you insist on restating my spiritual truths as \"my views\" rather than the correct interpretation of Gods word which your spirit cries out to you as being the truth.\n \n \nNo your using your belief in the gospel to spread a prejudiced view of others stooped din ignorance and insult.... Try again.\n\n \n More lies and self deceptions! I gain nothing from your homosexuality. I get no reward for your rebellion against Gods truths. I get no joy because the truths I share with you convict your spirit and cause you to attack me personally rather than just admit that you know I am telling you the truth according to Gods word and you just can't bring yourself to submit to His will over your life. At least that would be honest Jason, and God could then deal with you on that level of openness. But as long as you continue to deny His truths in favor of these fleshly lusts, you are leading yourself down the road to your own destruction.\n \n \nI stopped using Mac's in the 90's.

   "Really? Have you seen this?\n\n \n Oh, yes, I really have seen that, and posted on it on another thread but which I cannot remember.\n \n First of all, the Hebrew word for evil \"rah\" is used in many different ways in the Bible. In the KJV Bible, it occurs 663 times. 431 times it is translated as \"evil.\" The other 232 times it is translated as \"wicked\", \"bad\", \"hurt\", \"harm\", \"ill\", \"sorrow\", \"mischief\", \"displeased\", \"adversity\", \"affliction\", \"trouble\", \"calamity\", \"grievous\", \"misery\", and \"trouble.\" So we can see that the word does not require that it be translated as \"evil.\" This is why different Bibles translate this verse differently. It is translated as \"calamity\" by the NASB and NKJV; \"disaster\" by the NIV; and \"woe\" by the RSV;\n \n Second, the context of the verse is speaking of natural phenomena.\n \n \"I am the Lord, and there is no other; Besides Me there is no God. I will gird you, though you have not known Me; 6That men may know from the rising to the setting of the sun That there is no one besides Me. I am the Lord, and there is no other, 7The One forming light and creating darkness, Causing well-being and creating calamity; I am the Lord who does all these,\" (Isaiah 45:5-7).\n \n Notice that the context of the verse is dealing with who God is, that it is God who speaks of natural phenomena (sun, light, dark), and it is God who is able to cause \"well-being\" as well as \"calamity.\" Contextually, this verse is dealing with natural disasters, and human comfort issues. It is not speaking of moral evil; rather, it is dealing with calamity, distress, etc. This is consistent with other scriptures. For example,\n \n * \"And the Lord said to him, \"Who has made man&#8217;s mouth? Or who makes him dumb or deaf, or seeing or blind? Is it not I, the Lord?\" (Exodus 4:11).\n * \"Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? shall there be evil in a city, and the LORD hath not done it?\" (Amos 3:6).\n \n Also, take note that Isaiah is presenting contrasts. He speaks of \"light\" and \"darkness\", \"well being\" and \"calamity\". The word \"well-being\" in the Hebrew is the word for 'peace', \"Shalome\". So, in the context, we are seeing two sets of opposites: Light and dark, peace and non-peace, or well being and calamity. The \"evil\" that is spoken of is not ontological evil, but the evil experienced by people in the form of calamity.\n \n From the above two verses (Exodus 4:11; Amos 3:6) we can see that the Lord is involved in calamity and problems in the earthly realm. Exodus 4:11 is speaking of human frailty and Amos 3:6 is speaking of woes in a city. It is not a moral evil that God brings, but calamity and distress upon people.\n Of course, this raises other questions of why God would do such a thing, which I won't cover here. But, we can trust that whatever God does is just and is used for teaching, guiding, and disciplining His people.\n \n Third, there are other verses that clearly show that God is pure and that He cannot approve of evil.\n \n * &#8220;The Rock! His work is perfect, For all His ways are just; a God of faithfulness and without injustice, righteous and upright is He,\" (Deut. 32:4).\n * \"Thine eyes are too pure to approve evil, and Thou canst not look on wickedness with favor,\" (Hab. 1:13).\n \n We can see that the Bible teaches that God is pure and does not approve of evil, that the word \"rah\" (evil) in Hebrew can mean many things, and that contextually, the verse is speaking calamity and distress. Therefore, God does not create evil in the moral sense, but in the sense of disaster, of calamity. CARM",

That's the point! If more Christians would listen to the Spirit, He would teach the the SAME thing. It is not the Spirit that contradicts Himself, it is the prejudice and the mind of individuals.\n \n So, notwithstanding as you so eloquently put it above, my nostrils are not stuck up ER's and Archie's colons.  With this little tidbit, you have truly shown yourself of a reprobate and selfish mind, lashing out when you feel the necessity requires to cut your enemy down to size. I am not your enemy.\n \n You are as much a stranger to me, per se, as is Easyrider and Archangel, yet, you presume to allude to all three of us as some 'whacko fundamentalists', rejecting out of hand anything that does not have your broadest interpretation of what we believe.\n \n I have no regard to what you think, sir. It is meaningless. Something written on this little forum as opposed to all the greater tribulations happening in the world at present. You don't have a clue.\n \n In the back of my mind, there is always the though that I can never be absolutely certain of my faith. Anyone who says they are are the same as those who are 'absolutely certain' that their faith in evolution, etc, is a ''fact'.\n No, you don't know. You can proclaim it to the 'heavens, sic, that you know, but you do not know. \n \n However, let me tell you a truth, that you can assuredly accept as a truth: Atheists and others, including those who claim a cursory belief in 'God' , but who believe in nothing, have NOTHING. What you believe is TRUE! You are destined for oblivion, just death. You CAN be certain of that.\n \n I believe in Jesus Christ! I will pattern my life after Him to the extent I can and will fight the good fight. When I am on my deathbed, looking back, I will have the feeling that I do many times after a hard days exhausting work mentally and physically, and know with satisfaction that I did my best that day. I hope I will be able to say the same thing about my LIFE. \n \n I believe in advance that Easyrider and Archangel will agree with me on this too. :) \n \n Good day.",

   "There are numerous beginnings in the Bible. Philippians 4:15 speaks of the \"beginning of the gospel.\" In Acts 11:15, Peter refers to \"the beginning.\" However, from the context it is clear that he is referring to the day of Pentecost in Acts 2.\n \n One of the most common beginnings in scripture and probably the one referred to in John 8:44 is the beginning of this present world. That is, it refers to the six-day creation of Genesis, chapter one. However, we have good reason to believe that Satan was created before the beginning of our present world and that he fell into sin before that time. Therefore, the devil was created perfect but fell because of sin and was a liar and a murderer from the beginning of creation as we know it. Yet, he was not a murderer and a liar from the time of his own creation. That would make God the source of iniquity. The absolute holiness of God would not allow this to be the case.\n \n This is one of the main reasons that I believe in a gap of time between the original creation and the six-day creation. It was during this gap that Satan/Lucifer rebelled against God.\n\n \n It's possible, but I don't think the case here. John doesn't even hint that there possibly was a time when the Devil was not a murderer or liar. By saying from the beginning while speaking of the Devil as the focus it seems unlikely he meant some time after the devil's beginning. \n \n Your argument may apply to the reference the father of lies, being that he would be the originator of lies, but not made that way. This view though is complicated by John stating there is no truth in him and it is his native tongue which taken in context would imply from his inception.\n \n Based on these observations I go back to my questions of why did God create such a being and why did he place him in his perfect creation with his beloved children?",

   "\n Based on these observations I go back to my questions of why did God create such a being and why did he place him in his perfect creation with his beloved children?\n\n \n Satan, the Smoking Gun\n \n Unless man has free will to sin or not to sin, he is simply a pre-programmed robot. Consider the following:\n \n MAN CREATED IN THE LIKENESS AND IMAGE OF GOD\n \n \"Then God said, 'Let us make man in our own image, in our likeness....'\" (Genesis 1:26). Thereafter, Adam and Eve ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The critical question here is: Is the knowledge of good and evil a prerequisite for coming into the likeness and image of God? Genesis 3:22 seems to answer this in the affirmative - \"And the Lord God said, 'The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil.\" At the other end of the Bible we see this curious verse - \"To him who overcomes, I will give the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God\" (Revelation 2:7). What is it that one must overcome to eat of the tree of eternal life (note that Christ is symbolized as the 'Tree of Life' - \"For there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved\" - Acts 4:12. \n \n It is well documented throughout the New Testament that Jesus is the only way into heaven, the paradise of God). From my research, sin, evil, and the (carnal) world are the things that God commands us to overcome. \"Sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must master it\" (Genesis 4:7). \"For everyone born of God overcomes the world\" (1 John 5:4). \"Who overcomes the world? Only he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God\" (1 John 5:5). In the garden of Eden, Adam and Eve are not allowed to eat of the tree of life and gain eternal life (Genesis 3:22). In the book of Revelation, once man has overcome evil, he is then allowed to eat of that same tree and enter into eternal life. \n \n But is there another way for man to overcome evil and come into God's likeness and image other than having to get \"down and dirty\" in the midst of it? In the book of Romans there are three sources of 'light' (the revelation of God to man). In Romans chapter one (1:20) it says that God reveals to man His divine nature by what has been made - the heavens and the earth (also note Psalm 19:1-6 and Psalm 97:6). But while the evidence for God is clearly known to man in this way, it does not necessarily or specifically provide a mechanism for overcoming evil. Man knew who God was before and after the fall, yet God would still not allow him to eat of the tree of life. Man had to go another route. \n \n In Romans chapter two (2:15) it says that man's conscience bears witness to him of doing right or wrong. This seems like a more viable option in dealing with evil. Yet if this was the way God wanted man to come into His own likeness and image, why was the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world? It would have just been an exercise in futility. It is not enough to just know that something is wrong - man also needed to know why it was wrong and what the consequences of his actions would be. Knowing the personal consequences of sin seems to indicate a much further walk down the road of evil than does the work of conscience alone. In addition, man would need to know what evil is in order to be able to make a comparison to what good is. You must know what sound is before you have an objective sense of what silence is. God created evil (Isaiah 45:7 - KJV). Again, creation denotes purpose. What was the purpose of evil? For one thing, if there is a law of sowing and reaping, there has to be good and evil to provide 'rewards' for both activities. Secondly, for man to have true free will, he must also be allowed to delve into the ugly morass of iniquity as an alternative to following God. If there was only goodness, God would seem to be the only option. And finally, for man to reign eternally with God, he should have a clear and in-depth knowledge of the consequences of sin and evil, and be able to overcome it. But the crux of the matter is that man's (Adam's) conscience was not a formidable enough deterrent to ward off falling into sin. And this was before carnality entered into man. So conscience therefore has to be eliminated as the primary factor in dealing with evil.\n \n The third source of light is in Romans chapter three, the revelation of righteousness by faith in Jesus Christ, the true \"light.\" Christ is the manifestation of grace and mercy, two of God's most endearing attributes. Christ is the vehicle by which man overcomes evil and the world. If man overcomes evil by his own actions and conscience, then he might have something to boast about. But if by God Himself, then God plays the major role in the redemptive plan of mankind. It all seems to point towards the fall and Jesus Christ the Redeemer as the only logical alternative to overcoming evil. God ordained that man should come into His own likeness and image - knowing both good and evil - and then provided the means of overcoming evil and gaining eternal life.\n \n SATAN, THE SMOKING GUN\n \n \"For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He tempt anyone;\n but each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged\n away and enticed.\" (James 1:13-14)\n \n Satan is the tempter. The above verse seems to indicate that no individual is willfully tempted by God. Consider now Matthew 4:1 - \"Then Jesus was led by the (Holy) Spirit into the desert to be tempted by the devil.\" Taken in conjunction with each other, this appears at first glance to be a clear cut case of a Biblical contradiction. God does not tempt, but it is clear His purpose was for Jesus to be tempted, and He, as the Holy Spirit, even led Jesus to that end. There are two ways of answering this dilemma without chucking our Bibles into the trash. The first would be to make the assumption that Matthew 4:1 indicates that no natural man is tempted by God. Jesus would therefore not fall into this category because He is also fully God. The second explanation, and the one I prefer, is that God does not tempt anyone, He allows Satan to do it - He allows Satan to engage in this activity, subject, of course, to God's permissible will. \n \n With this in mind, we go back to the garden of Eden and who do we find? That ancient serpent, Satan. What is he doing there? Was Adam not evicted from the garden because of his fall into sin? Why wasn't Satan? If the garden is a sanctified and holy area, one would think that God would have the sovereign power and desire to keep it that way. Unless, of course, there was a divine purpose involved for Satan to be there. And what would that purpose be? To tempt Adam into the fall so that man would come into the knowledge of good and evil, overcome it through the power Of Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit, and be raised complete in the image and likeness of God. Man cannot be an overcomer until he has something to overcome, like sin and Satan. In my mind, Satan is the \"smoking gun\" who serves the greater purpose of God. \n \n One other observation. Whereas Genesis 1:26 states that God was to create man in His own image and likeness, Genesis 1:27 shows that man was only created in God's \"image.\" It wasn't until Genesis 3:22 when Adam ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil that he became \"like\" God. \n \n To Summarize:\n \n 1. Man was to be created in the likeness and image of God (Genesis 1:26).\n \n 2. Part of this \"likeness\" was a knowledge of good and evil (Genesis 3:22)\n \n 3. For Adam to be truly \"like\" God, he had to acquire a knowledge of good and evil.\n \n 4. The means to that end was eating of the tree of the knowledge of good \n and evil.\n \n 5. To do that a \"tempter\" was likely needed to entice Adam into sin.\n \n 6. God provided, or allowed, Satan as the tempter.\n \n 7. God knew in advance what the outcome would be, but allowed it anyway.\n \n 8. God knew atonement would be required, and provided Jesus Christ as the\n \"Lamb slain from the foundation of the earth\" (Revelation 13:8).\n \n 9. Man achieves the likeness of God, acquires a knowledge of and overcomes\n evil, partakes of Christ (the \"tree of life\"), and is reunited in paradise with \n God. Man, like God, is now an overcomer.\n \n The key to all this remains, \"Is acquiring a knowledge of good and evil a prerequisite to coming into the likeness and image of God? If the answer is yes, I think Adam has to eat from that tree, and God has to make it happen. If the answer is no, then I think you have to look back to Genesis 3:22 and reconcile that with Genesis 1:26, explaining how Adam is \"like\" God, but at the same time lacks a knowledge of good and evil. Also, how does man acquire that knowledge without eating of the fruit of that tree? ",

First of all, we take the weight of scripture (look it up) that God is holy and perfect thus could not create evil. We can also look at Job 38: 1-7. \n \n If everything was in harmony, then I believe it is reasonable indication that Lucifer had not yet been cast down, thus indicating that he sinned at a later time(through pride) as was noted. Satan WAS a liar and murderer from the the point he became Satan.\n \n Job 38\n \n Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,\n 2Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?\n 3Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.\n 4Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.\n 5Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?\n 6Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;\n 7When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy? \n \n Are you saying that God created Satan a liar and murderer and put him into His perfect creation for Satan's fall sometime in the future? Doesn't jibe, I don't think. We believe that Satan was a different named being (Lucifer) until he sinned and was cast down.",

Give it a rest Archie. Anyone besides you and the other members of the big three are accusing everyone of hating God....\n \n JP because he rebukes you, Esraledon attempts to pick apart his faith, the new Mormon guy, you guys pick apart his beliefs, my beliefs because I'm openly Gay and don't put up with your bull, I get some of the heaviest flack.\n \n Until one of your own people decide to ignore me because simply put I chew him up and spit him out...\n \n \n \nThe fact is that I didn't ridicule or slander you at all in the post above.\n\n \n LMAO look at the bold in your new post......\n \n \n \n I told you the absolute spiritual truth from Gods perspective which is the only perspective that will count in the end.\n\n \n Yes because you know the mind of God Archie.... Your really crazy....\n \n \n \n You must interpret everything I said to you as slander so you can ignore the true impact of what my words mean to your perverted and unnatural lifestyle. \n\n \n See the above?

THAT IS A FORM OF SLANDER.\n \n \n \n \nIn closing Jason, if in fact you were, or are a true believer who has truly accepted Jesus as your personal savior, I will try one more time to reach you with His Holy Word and warn you of that which you are doing by refusing to \"repent of your sins\" which means to \"turn away from them.\"\n \n\n \n Yeah well same old tired jargon. You don't care about reaching anyone, you care about people agreeing with you.... And you go about it in the most slanderous despicable way possible.\n \n I'll decide whether I'm finally done with you and place you on ignore if I wish.

   "Trebor: Let me make something emphatically clear for you since you do not appear to have the forthwithal to discern for yourself: The fact Easyrider, Archangel, and myself are conservative Christians and thus, for the most part, believe almost totally alike, is because we perceive what the Word of God teaches in a like manner. \n \n\n \n It is one thing to be a 'conservative Christian'. It is another thing to be accepting of bigotry and hate. Both Easyrider and Archie are very explicit in their bigotry and hate. Yet, you accept their behavior, yet do not accept behavior that is not as vehement against them. In my mind, that makes you hypocritical. One can 'perceive what the Word of God' teaches in a like manner, yet not agree with the scat, the spewing, the hate. You appear to be accepting of the scat, the spewing and the hate. \n \n \n\n Easyrider and Archangel are 'strangers', per se, however, they are brothers in Christ to me, thus, factually speaking, they are not strangers although I have never personally spoken to either in my life. \n \n Is it any reason why the Holy Spirit SHOULD NOT TEACH US THE SAME THING? That's the point! If more Christians would listen to the Spirit, He would teach the the SAME thing. It is not the Spirit that contradicts Himself, it is the prejudice and the mind of individuals.\n \n\n Well, you have yet to show that 'the Holy Spirit' teaches anything. Other people who claim to be filled with the 'holy spirit' seem to think that Jesus teaches something other than hate filled rhetoric against Jews, Atheists, Muslims, liberals, Hindus, Mormons, and JW's. There is a difference between someone being a conservative Christian, and following values for themselves, \n and someone being a conservative Christian, and trying to force other to conform to your values via bible thumping, threats, and trying to change laws. \n \n \n\n So, notwithstanding as you so eloquently put it above, my nostrils are not stuck up ER's and Archie's colons.  With this little tidbit, you have truly shown yourself of a reprobate and selfish mind, lashing out when you feel the necessity requires to cut your enemy down to size. I am not your enemy.\n \n\n \n Perhaps if you are willing to criticize Easyrider and Archie for their behavior as much as you are willing to do so for others (notice, I specifically mentioned behavior, not values), then I will accept that you are not a hypocrite. However, you are unwilling or unable to give the same kind of 'wrist slapping of behavior' you give others to Archangel and Easyrider. You ignore his comments , yet you attack people who respond in kind. \n \n \n\n \n You are as much a stranger to me, per se, as is Easyrider and Archangel, yet, you presume to allude to all three of us as some 'whacko fundamentalists', rejecting out of hand anything that does not have your broadest interpretation of what we believe.\n \n\n \n When you show you are something other than a watered down version of ER and Archy, then you will be given the proper consideration. A criticism against their techniques and bigotry would actually have more meaning from you than from someone they automatically oppose no matter what. I would LOVE to see them actually do something than knee jerk responses, huge cut/pastes that they do not actually understand or read themselves, and hate filled talk. \n \n\n \n I have no regard to what you think, sir. It is meaningless. Something written on this little forum as opposed to all the greater tribulations happening in the world at present. You don't have a clue.\n \n In the back of my mind, there is always the though that I can never be absolutely certain of my faith. Anyone who says they are are the same as those who are 'absolutely certain' that their faith in evolution, etc, is a ''fact'.\n No, you don't know. You can proclaim it to the 'heavens, sic, that you know, but you do not know. \n \n However, let me tell you a truth, that you can assuredly accept as a truth: Atheists and others, including those who claim a cursory belief in 'God' , but who believe in nothing, have NOTHING. What you believe is TRUE! You are destined for oblivion, just death. You CAN be certain of that.\n \n I believe in Jesus Christ! I will pattern my life after Him to the extent I can and will fight the good fight. When I am on my deathbed, looking back, I will have the feeling that I do many times after a hard days exhausting work mentally and physically, and know with satisfaction that I did my best that day. I hope I will be able to say the same thing about my LIFE. \n \n I believe in advance that Easyrider and Archangel will agree with me on this too. :) \n \n Good day.\n\n \n If you want to believe in Jesus Christ, go right ahead. If you think you are patterning your life after him, that is your prerogative. However, as far as I can see, turning a blind eye to actions of your 'brothers in Christ' , yet attacking others for a more mild version of it is not something makes you appear to be 'living the of Jesus would'.",

No thank you, sir. Actually I am not a 'watered down' version, their values are my own. They could back off on their actions, but again, they give what they get. They have a different way of going about it, as most of you have been having it out for ages. From then very first day I came on here and you and your buddies saw I was a Christian, the spleen came out non-stop. You would love to see them do something other than knee-jerk responses, well give me the opportunity to see a respectful response from you, and see what you get in return. \"having your nose up someone's colon\" is not a respectful response. But of course that's your version of 'mild'. \n \n And if I am a good boy, you will give me the 'proper consideration'.

   "Ok, let's say you believe there is a dilemma here. First of all, we take the weight of scripture (look it up) that God is holy and perfect thus could not create evil. We can also look at Job 38: 1-7. \n \n If everything was in harmony, then I believe it is reasonable indication that Lucifer had not yet been cast down, thus indicating that he sinned at a later time(through pride) as was noted. Satan WAS a liar and murderer from the the point he became Satan.\n \n Job 38\n \n Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,\n 2Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?\n 3Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.\n 4Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.\n 5Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?\n 6Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;\n 7When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy? \n \n Are you saying that God created Satan a liar and murderer and put him into His perfect creation for Satan's fall sometime in the future? Doesn't jibe, I don't think. We believe that Satan was a different named being (Lucifer) until he sinned and was cast down.\n\n \n I am bringing attention to verses believed to have a particular meaning, but that understanding isn't consistent with others. As you have pointed out there are verses that are thought to mean God cannot create evil, also that God will not permit it, that God does not tempt, thou shalt not bear false witness, sin entered the world thru man are just a few beliefs that would be at odds with what John is saying. \n \n So either some verses are not understood correctly, the verses have not been accurately handed down over time or the author(s) are mistaken. \n \n Do you see any other possibility? I don't find any fault with your views as above taken in the context in which they appear. When that meaning is compared to John though they don't equate to the same understanding of God and The Devil.",

   "Satan, the Smoking Gun\n \n Unless man has free will to sin or not to sin, he is simply a pre-programmed robot. Consider the following: \n\n I wonder if you read these before you post them. You can take this back if you want. Below are just a few problems with this book.\n Why can you not acknowledge the accepted English language definition of free will? I have explained it to you. I have pasted from dictionaries, but you insist on using it incorrectly to support your position. Attributing a false meaning to something does not strengthen your position.\n I did say please, you know, about the pasting a thesis, but off the cliff you go.\n \n \nTo Summarize:\n \n 1. Man was to be created in the likeness and image of God (Genesis 1:26). \n\n Actually it says let us make him and then he does, but something went wrong. \n Gen 1:31 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good.\n \n \n2. Part of this \"likeness\" was a knowledge of good and evil (Genesis 3:22) \n\n You cannot have one without the other. Good existed with creation Gen 1:31. You place limitations on what is supposed to be an omnipotent being. The world was like Burger King, he could have it his own way.\n \n \n3. For Adam to be truly \"like\" God, he had to acquire a knowledge of good and evil. \n\n But once he did, he and everybody else was punished for it. You suggesting that God is man's teacher in what evil is.\n \n \n5. To do that a \"tempter\" was likely needed to entice Adam into sin. \n\n Good job! You now just said God created evil for the purpose of tempting man into sin to teach him what evil is. He sure did didn't he.\n \n \n6. God provided, or allowed, Satan as the tempter. \n\n Satan the smoking gun. Good title, fits perfectly. Not what you intended, but these things happen.\n \n \nThe key to all this remains, \"Is acquiring a knowledge of good and evil a prerequisite to coming into the likeness and image of God? \n\n Depends on which way you choose to interpret scripture.\n \n Let me know if you want me to rip the rest of this apart",

It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5 It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. \n \n 8 Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. 9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 10 but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears. 11 When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me. 12 Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known. \n \n 13 And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.\n\n \n Indeed. The \"love chapter.\" But, like the Bible says (in Romans), \"Love does a neighbor no harm\" (like enticing someone into a sinful relationship for which there are negative eternal consequences).

If we hold a stone out at arm&#8217;s length and let go, it can go either up or down, but left to itself, it will always go down. If it&#8217;s to go up, it&#8217;ll need outside help. We are the same. Left to our own devices, we are not completely free; we are only free to move away from God. If we are to move towards Him, we too need the outside help which only God can provide. Erasmus responded by claiming that this was unfair. And even Luther himself admits that at times in his life, he too disliked the idea that he didn&#8217;t have complete freedom of choice and that his salvation was entirely according to God&#8217;s will.\n \n Nevertheless, Luther was, I believe, correct in the main thrust of his argument (2). We are not free to choose God. We cannot save ourselves or cause ourselves to become &#8216;born again&#8217; (John 3:3), and if this were possible, Christ would have lived, died and risen for nothing (Gal 2:21). Ephesians 2:8 says &#8216;For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith - and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God - not by works, so that no one can boast.&#8217;\n \n Of course, these arguments can go on ad-infinitum and, for most students of theology, often do just this! I don&#8217;t have space for that luxury here, so will simply leave you with the following observations.\n \n The answer to our initial question is that people appear to exercise a kind of free-will but it doesn&#8217;t operate freely in all directions and tends to move away from God. If we set all other constraints aside (e.g., laws etc) a human being&#8217;s will is still not totally free. For a person to be able to move towards God, they need to be called by God; given the desire by God to seek him and be enabled to halt their downward fall (like the stone) which is taking them away from him. To be born again (John 3:3) is to have that &#8216;outside help&#8217; which works against our natural &#8216;stone-like&#8217; nature, so that we can truly repent &#8211; turn around (&#8216;full speed astern&#8217; as C.S Lewis so aptly put it) &#8211; and begin to move towards God. However, Christians are not completely free from sin or the temptation to sin (their stone-like nature still trying to drag them away from God). We only need to read Romans 7 to confirm this.\n \n At the end of the matter, we are left with three basic premises: 1) God is sovereign. He is above, beyond, behind and within all things and sees the end from the beginning. In some way, he &#8216;controls&#8217; all things - usually keeping within the laws of the nature he has created - towards his desired end for this world and the universe, but despite this, is never responsible for sin. 2) Within this framework (which, because of our finite, human nature remains a mystery to us) Christians have a certain amount of free-will. They are freed from the tyranny of the Law, for example, and there is now &#8216;no condemnation&#8217; for them (Rom 8:1). In the eyes of God, they are freed from the guilt of sin and are seen as beloved children. However, even their will is still not completely free; it is still a &#8216;fallen&#8217; will, just like the rest of their human nature. Christians, unless they deceive themselves, still fall into sin (1 John 1:8) and need to be forgiven regularly. 3). Non-Christians have essentially the same kind of freedom, but no &#8216;string&#8217; is tied to these &#8216;stones&#8217;. Their perceived freedom, which they often see as preferable and superior to those whom they see as being in subservience or bondage to &#8216;religion&#8217; is largely an illusion. They are constrained by all of the things we&#8217;ve discussed but they are otherwise &#8216;free&#8217; to move as far away from God as they desire.\n Chris Lazenby Midlands Bible College\n \n The above is pretty much as I see it, however, Easyrider is correct: God IS calling you. He is calling you through those of us who attempt to outline the Word to you. You can rail against their method, but nonetheless, you have been called.",

   "I honestly think the 12 year old would have more reasoning and insight than you....\n\n You are first hand evidence of the falsity of this claim since you represent the reasoning of a 12 year old.\n \nBut you see that would actually be CARING and sincere in your beliefs. These people are not sincere. Their using their faith as a cloak to wield prejudice and scorn at others simply because they feel justified by the divine....\n\n \n Feel free to point out what I've said here that is based in prejudice for the sake of condemning you, if you can. The bottom line is, you hate the spiritual truth which convicts you of your sin against God, not my words which detail that sin.\n [INDENT=Archangel;392732]If you will actually read my posts correctly, I wont have to keep correcting you so often. \n \n Not at all, you lie again as usual. I hold scriptural views as superior to fallen Mans, and correcting your perversion of Gods word as you attempt to justify homosexuality which He condemns is not judging you but correcting your error which will ultimately condemn you. How is that act on my part not an expression of extreme love on my part? \n \n Oh wait, you don't seek Gods truth at all but to simply reinforce that corruption of His word which feeds your fleshly lusts as a homosexual. \n \n My judgments on your sinful lifestyle which God condemns in His word is totally justified since you spend half of your posts demanding, no, insisting that you too are a born again believer who has accepted Christ as your personal savior. If that is true Jason, then how can you continue to crucify Him with every homosexual indiscretion you participate in? Here's what I mean, from the bible:\n Hbr 6:4 For [it is] impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit,\n Hbr 6:5 and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come,\n Hbr 6:6 if they fall away, [fn] to renew them again to repentance, since they crucify again for themselves the Son of God, and put [Him] to an open shame. \n Rom 8:5 For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.\n Rom 8:6 For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.\n See, there you go again. Look at how you reinterpret what I say by referring to them as my views when you know very well they are the scriptural views which your own father and his church elders have taught you. By your very homosexual blindness and need for justification of this perversion of the flesh, you insist on restating my spiritual truths as \"my views\" rather than the correct interpretation of Gods word which your spirit cries out to you as being the truth.\n \n More lies and self deceptions! I gain nothing from your homosexuality. I get no reward for your rebellion against Gods truths. I get no joy because the truths I share with you convict your spirit and cause you to attack me personally rather than just admit that you know I am telling you the truth according to Gods word and you just can't bring yourself to submit to His will over your life. At least that would be honest Jason, and God could then deal with you on that level of openness. But as long as you continue to deny His truths in favor of these fleshly lusts, you are leading yourself down the road to your own destruction.\n \n Great, at 23 years old, you were only 7 in 1994. I'm sure you just decided Macs didn't work for you anymore so you went out and bought IBM, right? emoticon_xgood emoticon_xdonno\n \nKeep telling yourself all of this Archie.... If you don't delight or gain anything why do you continue to ridicule, slander, and paint a case against gays so strongly?\n\n \n The real question here is why do I waste my time attempting to reach a reprobate who continues to crucify Christ and lie to himself as he refuses to acknowledge the truth I am telling you? In every single post I have written you and relied on posting scripture verses to support my arguments, not once in your response to me have you allowed those verses to remain but have redacted them every single time.\n \n You claim to be a true believer in Christ yet you hate His word and can't stand to have HIS truths pierce your soul so you ignore them and run from them like the coward in denial, that you are. The fact is that I didn't ridicule or slander you at all in the post above. I told you the absolute spiritual truth from Gods perspective which is the only perspective that will count in the end. You must interpret everything I said to you as slander so you can ignore the true impact of what my words mean to your perverted and unnatural lifestyle. \n \n In closing Jason, if in fact you were, or are a true believer who has truly accepted Jesus as your personal savior, I will try one more time to reach you with His Holy Word and warn you of that which you are doing by refusing to \"repent of your sins\" which means to \"turn away from them.\"\n \n Hbr 6:4 For [it is] impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit,\n Hbr 6:5 and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come,\n Hbr 6:6 if they fall away, [fn] to renew them again to repentance, since they crucify again for themselves the Son of God, and put [Him] to an open shame. \n And JP, I'm very disappointed in your inability to discern the spirit in which I correct and reprove what Jason represents.",

You ignore that we are commanded to be disciples and to spread the good news and then you claim that a person knows who they are when you don't have a clue as to who you really are.\n\n \n You say liar, but have only your word to back it up. Spiteful aren't you, and since you have trouble distinguishing, liar is someone who intentionally states something that isn't fact or truth. You know, what you have been doing. \n \n I see your playing Jesus again. Yes indeed you know what is correct doctrine, you know what is wrong with the world, you know what errors people make, you know, you know, you know what you want to know and sadly only the way you want to know it.

   "Consider the Viking Religion :\n \n 'Gods and Heroes\n Besides Odin, the major deities of Scandinavian mythology were his wife, Frigg, goddess of the home; Valhalla. There the warriors would spend their days fighting and nights feasting until Ragnarok, the day of the final world battle, in which the old gods would perish and a new reign of peace and love would be instituted. Ordinary individuals were received after death by the goddess Hel in a cheerless underground world.\n Scandinavian mythology included dwarves; elves; and the Norns, who distributed fates to mortals. The ancient Scandinavians also believed in personal spirits, such as the fylgja and the hamingja, which in some respects resembled the Christian idea of the soul. The gods were originally conceived as a confederation of two formerly warring divine tribes, the Aesir and the Vanir. Odin was originally the leader of the Aesir, which consisted of at least 12 gods. Together all the gods lived in Asgard. \n \n Creation belief\n The Eddic poem V\u00f6lusp\u00e1 (Prophecy of the Seeress) portrays a period of primeval chaos, followed by the creation of giants and gods and, finally, of humankind. Ginnungagap was the yawning void, Jotunheim the home of the giants, Niflheim the region of cold, and Muspellsheim the realm of heat. The great world-tree, Yggdrasil, reached through all time and space, but it was perpetually under attack from Nidhogg, the evil serpent. The fountain of Mimir, source of hidden wisdom, lay under one of the roots of the tree.'\n Viking Religion\n \n 6,000-9,000 years BCE.\n See the similarities to Christianity? \n I'm sure these ancient people believed just as strongly as you do in their Gods. Does that mean they actually existed?",

   "A different perspective. Easyrider is correct based on how HE is approaching the issue, but there are some different approaches: \n \n We are like stones, said Luther. If we hold a stone out at arm's length and let go, it can go either up or down, but left to itself, it will always go down. If it's to go up, it'll need outside help. We are the same. Left to our own devices, we are not completely free; we are only free to move away from God. If we are to move towards Him, we too need the outside help which only God can provide. Erasmus responded by claiming that this was unfair. And even Luther himself admits that at times in his life, he too disliked the idea that he didn't have complete freedom of choice and that his salvation was entirely according to God's will.\n \n Nevertheless, Luther was, I believe, correct in the main thrust of his argument (2). We are not free to choose God. We cannot save ourselves or cause ourselves to become 'born again' (John 3:3), and if this were possible, Christ would have lived, died and risen for nothing (Gal 2:21). Ephesians 2:8 says 'For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith - and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God - not by works, so that no one can boast.'\n \n Of course, these arguments can go on ad-infinitum and, for most students of theology, often do just this! I don't have space for that luxury here, so will simply leave you with the following observations.\n \n The answer to our initial question is that people appear to exercise a kind of free-will but it doesn't operate freely in all directions and tends to move away from God. If we set all other constraints aside (e.g., laws etc) a human being's will is still not totally free. For a person to be able to move towards God, they need to be called by God; given the desire by God to seek him and be enabled to halt their downward fall (like the stone) which is taking them away from him. To be born again (John 3:3) is to have that 'outside help' which works against our natural 'stone-like' nature, so that we can truly repent - turn around ('full speed astern' as C.S Lewis so aptly put it) - and begin to move towards God. However, Christians are not completely free from sin or the temptation to sin (their stone-like nature still trying to drag them away from God). We only need to read Romans 7 to confirm this.\n \n At the end of the matter, we are left with three basic premises: 1) God is sovereign. He is above, beyond, behind and within all things and sees the end from the beginning. In some way, he 'controls' all things - usually keeping within the laws of the nature he has created - towards his desired end for this world and the universe, but despite this, is never responsible for sin. 2) Within this framework (which, because of our finite, human nature remains a mystery to us) Christians have a certain amount of free-will. They are freed from the tyranny of the Law, for example, and there is now 'no condemnation' for them (Rom 8:1). In the eyes of God, they are freed from the guilt of sin and are seen as beloved children. However, even their will is still not completely free; it is still a 'fallen' will, just like the rest of their human nature. Christians, unless they deceive themselves, still fall into sin (1 John 1:8) and need to be forgiven regularly. 3). Non-Christians have essentially the same kind of freedom, but no 'string' is tied to these 'stones'. Their perceived freedom, which they often see as preferable and superior to those whom they see as being in subservience or bondage to 'religion' is largely an illusion. They are constrained by all of the things we've discussed but they are otherwise 'free' to move as far away from God as they desire.\n Chris Lazenby Midlands Bible College\n \n The above is pretty much as I see it, however, Easyrider is correct: God IS calling you. He is calling you through those of us who attempt to outline the Word to you. You can rail against their method, but nonetheless, you have been called.\n\n \n I understand what ER thinks free will is. My hang up in this particular exchange is, as you have stated elsewhere, has to do with speaking the same language and not redefining English to fit a need. As well as the post which began this part of the thread where he posted a lengthy explanation that needed man to have free will as part of it's conclusion and not partial as you describe, but complete.",

   "You really haven't studied Genesis much have you? Just reguritated the tripe the liberals gave you.\n \n \n When was the Sun Created? \n NCW 72, July-September 2001 \n by Christopher C. Warren\n \n Q. For some reason, according to the bible, God creates the earth, plants, and daytime before He creates the sun. I understand the writers of the bible did not have a full understanding of photosynthesis and such, but God did - who supposedly directed their writings. When the sun is finally created it is suggested that the sun exists for calendar purposes, not necessarily for day and light as it was already created (at this point, one must resist the temptation to think that the creation story is a primitive human perspective on reality, or maybe God created our beginnings in a chaotic and illogical fashion, perhaps to trick us into believing by means of faith only). Finally, after everything was finished, God rested. His error producing blueprints were set into motion. \n \n A. I will only answer the first part of this in the hope it will encourage you to be more carefully do your research before you start coming to absurd conclusions, though you are not entirely to blame. It is possible to intellectualise simple language until it becomes a meaningless fog, capable of most any interpretation that the intellect wants to promote. \"As a ring in a bull's nose easily leads a subdued animal, so a faulty paradigm leads to faulty interpretation, no matter where one turns in scripture\" (Dr.l Willard Aldrich). \n The Hebrew Bible nowhere states that the earth, plants and daytime were created before the sun. A careful reading of the primary Hebrew text (as opposed to our English translations which often reflect certain sectarian biases) reveals that the sun, moon and stars were all present in Genesis 1:1-3: \n \n \"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Now the earth was deserted and empty and darkness was on the surface of the ocean, And the Spirit of God was brooding over the waters. Then God said, Let there be light ... There was evening and there was morning - day one\" (literal translation of the Masoretic text). \n \n It must always be remembered that the description of creation is from a geocentric point-of-view, i.e. an observer on the earth. The writer of Genesis is not standing in space looking down on earth. That juxtaposition is critical. \n We continue: \n \n \"And God said, Let luminaries in the expanse of the air be for separating the day from the night. And let them serve as signals to mark seasons and days and years. And let them be luminaries in the expanse of the air to give light upon the earth. And it was so. God brought forth (not 'created' or 'made') two great luminaries - the greater luminary to dominate the day and the lesser luminary to dominate the night - the stars also. God gave them forth in the expanse of the air ... \" (Gen.1:14-16, literal translation). \n \n The point will become clear as we examine the literal words of two other passages: \n \n \"Where were you when I laid the earth's foundation? ... Who shut up the sea behind doors when it burst forth from the womb, when I made the clouds its garment and thick darkness a diaper for it ... ?\" (Job 38:4,8-9). \"For six days Yahweh worked on the air and the land, the sea and all that is in them ...\" (Ex.20:11) \n \n In other words, the sun and moon and stars were all present from the beginning but were not initially visible from the earth's surface until the third day when the thick layer of water-saturated cloud was dispersed. \n \n NCCG.ORG New Covenant Church of God - B'rit Chadashah Assembly of Yahweh, FAQ 325: When was the Sun Created?\n \n Or, Have you ever read Revelation 21:23? \n \n \"The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and the Lamb is its lamp.\" So, the initial \"light\" can arguably be the light of God. Or it can simply be light appearing somewhere in the universe.\n \n Jesus is Lord, and you need to repent and receive him as your Lord and Savior for the remission of your sins before you drop down into the Pit with the Devil himself. Forever.\n\n \n Ummm ER did you by chance give any type of thought to this before posting it?\n \n Not only are his conclusions off, but it doesn't address the the statement made unless your intent was to indirectly support the claim.\n \n \n\"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Now the earth was deserted and empty and darkness was on the surface of the ocean, \n \n\n This means the Earth is created. There isn't anything living, but you either have to conclude a massive ball of water or our planet.\n \n \nAnd the Spirit of God was brooding over the waters. Then God said, Let there be light ... There was evening and there was morning - day one\" \n\n \n There is his what he claims is the creation of the Sun, but there is no morning or evening without the rotation of the Earth which whether a big water drop or a water drop with dirt was in existence before the light.\n \n Before you ask one example of where he is off is as he makes clear God guides the writers hand, but then insists that the story is from the perspective of man who has yet to be created when the light is called and later when the sun is brought forth. God looked down at his creation, not up.",

But for our universe, that is a very complicated question to ask! The boundary at the edge of the dough represents the \"edge\" of space. By definition, we exist within space and have no way to leave it!

These are questions that we have no way to give a scientific answer to, so the simple answer is that we don't know! All we do know is that based on our current understanding of theoretical cosmology, the universe does not have a boundary - it is either infinite or it wraps around itself in some way. Observations seem to agree with these predictions in the sense that if the universe does have a boundary, we know that the boundary is so far away from us that we can't currently see it and it doesn't have any effect on us. \n\n That's really all I needed to hear.

And God saw that it was good. \n 19 And there was evening, and there was morning&#8212;the fourth day. \n \n 3 And God said, \"Let there be light,\" and there was light. \n \n 4 God saw that the light was good, and He separated the light from the darkness. \n \n 5 God called the light \"day,\" and the darkness he called \"night.\" And there was evening, and there was morning&#8212;the first day. \n \n 6 And God said, \"Let there be an expanse between the waters to separate water from water.\" \n \n 7 So God made the expanse and separated the water under the expanse from the water above it. And it was so. \n \n 8 God called the expanse \"sky.\" And there was evening, and there was morning&#8212;the second day. \n \n 9 And God said, \"Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear.\" And it was so. \n 10 God called the dry ground \"land,\" and the gathered waters he called \"seas.\" And God saw that it was good. \n \n 11 Then God said, \"Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds.\" And it was so. \n 12 The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. \n 13 And there was evening, and there was morning&#8212;the third day. \n \n 20 And God said, \"Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky.\" \n 21 So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living and moving thing with which the water teems, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. \n 22 God blessed them and said, \"Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.\" \n 23 And there was evening, and there was morning&#8212;the fifth day. \n \n 24 And God said, \"Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, creatures that move along the ground, and wild animals, each according to its kind.\" And it was so. \n 25 God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. \n \n 26 Then God said, \"Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, [b] and over all the creatures that move along the ground.\" \n \n 27 So God created man in his own image, \n in the image of God he created him; \n male and female he created them. \n \n 28 God blessed them and said to them, \"Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground.\" \n \n 29 Then God said, \"I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food. \n 30 And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air and all the creatures that move on the ground&#8212;everything that has the breath of life in it&#8212;I give every green plant for food.\" And it was so. \n \n 31 God saw all that he had made, and it was very good.

   "How incredibly ignorant.\n\n \n Parable of the Wedding Feast - Matthew 22:1-14\n \n 2 \"The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son. 3 He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come, but they refused to come. 4 \"Then he sent some more servants and said, `Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner: My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.' 5 \"But they paid no attention and went off--one to his field, another to his business. 6 The rest seized his servants, mistreated them and killed them. 7 The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city. 8 \"Then he said to his servants, `The wedding banquet is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come. 9 Go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find.' 10 So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests. 11 \"But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes. 12 `Friend,' he asked, `how did you get in here without wedding clothes?' The man was speechless. 13 \"Then the king told the attendants, `Tie him hand and foot, and throw him outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' 14 \"For many are invited, but few are chosen.\" \n \n In this Parable:\n 1. The King = God the Father \n 2. The Son = God the Son, Jesus Christ\n 3. The first group that was invited = The Israelites who declined\n 4. The second group that was invited = The Gentiles and those Jews who accepted\n 5. The servants = those who preach the Gospel of Christ's salvation\n \n Explanation of the Parable:\n \n God's chosen people, the Jews, were the first to receive the invitation to receive their Savior Jesus Christ, the Son of God whom they rejected. The Wedding / Gospel invitation was then given to others (the gentiles - note Romans 1:16, etc.). In short, everyone had received an invitation, but not everyone accepted the invitation.\n \n Note that the Book of Revelation describes a future marriage of the Lamb (Jesus - John 1:29) and His Bride (Revelation 19:7).\n \n The guest who was not arrayed in the proper wedding attire was one who had declined God's gift of salvation and righteousness - a robe of righteousness that comes not from man, but from God only:\n \n Isaiah 61:10, \"I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.\"\n \n Note that in Genesis 15:6, this righteousness comes through faith in God: \n \n \"Abram believed (had faith in) the Lord, and it was credited to him as righteousness.\" \n \n Also note Ephesians 2:8-9 in the New Testament.\n \n Believers are covered with God's garment of righteousness / salvation. When God looks at the repentant sinner He does not see the filthy attire of sin, but the robe of righteousness obtained by Christ's perfect obedience to the law. There are none righteous apart from this God-given righteousness. A perfect example that this righteousness is not obtained by man's own inherent \"goodness\" is found in Zechariah chapter 3:\n \n 3 Now Joshua was dressed in filthy clothes as he stood before the angel. 4 The angel said to those who were standing before him, \"Take off his filthy clothes.\" Then he said to Joshua, \"See, I have taken away your sin, and I will put rich garments on you.\"\n \n Filthy clothes = sin in the above scripture, while a robe of righteousness = a garment of salvation in Isaiah 61:10.\n \n From the New Testament we find:\n \n Romans 13:14 - \"Rather, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ...\" \n \n Philippians 3:9 - \"..not having a righteousness of my own that comes from (keeping ) the law, but that which is through faith in Christ...\"\n \n Also note that in Matthew 22:10 - \"...the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.\"\n \n Here we see the illustration of those gathered off the streets - people who may well have not been able to afford special wedding garments on such short notice. Also note that those gathered were both \"good and bad,\" so that the invitation was not based on works alone, otherwise just the \"good\" would have been invited. So the wedding garments - the garments of salvation - were God's gift to those who accepted the invitation to the Son's (Christ's) wedding to his bride - his church of true believers.\n \n In the end, those without the God / Christ-given robe of righteousness / salvation were cast into the outer darkness, where there is weeping and the gnashing of teeth.\n \n \"For many are invited, but few are chosen.\" Matthew 22:14\n \n Let the WISE understand and receive Jesus Christ.",

   "LOL! That's like saying - when a murderer gets electrocuted - that the State caused it. \n\n To make your analogy fair, we would have to sya that the state created said murderer, knew full well that the murderer would grow up to kill somone, knew that they would end up straping him to an electric chair and frying him, and knew that they had the power to stop him or never create him in the first place. In that case, I would agree that the state caused it. \n \n I kinda covered this in my previous post when I said: \n \n \nHow could god be sorry he made humans? You contend that he created us from nothing, he is all knowing, and everything we are comes from god. That includes our ability to be and do evil. If god was all knowing, he would have known ahead of time that humans would one day do evil, and he would have known that he would be sorry he had created us. So why would he have done it in the first place? Something stinks in this story. \n\n But you conveniently ignored that one. emoticon_xgood\n \n \nAnother revisionist gaffe. Here's your flaming liberals and what they said about Saddam and his WMD's:\n\n \n It's not revisionist. Show me where what I said about Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld et al that is not true. The fact that most of the republicans and many of the democrats jumped on board with them just goes to show how stupid they are. Your long list of quotes is great. One thing you may have overlooked though, my last name is not Clinton, Albright, Berger, Levin, Daschle, Kerry, Pelosi, Graham, Gore, Kennedy, Byrd, Rockefeller, or Waxman...and I don't fall in line goose-stepping behind them.

Unconverted men walk over the pit of hell on a rotten covering, and there are innumerable places in this covering so weak that they will not bear their weight, and these places are not seen.

All the means that there are of sinners going out of the world, are so in God's hands, and so universally and absolutely subject to his power and determination, that it does not depend at all the less on the mere will of God, whether sinners shall at any moment go to hell, than if means were never made use of, or at all concerned in the case.\n \n http://www.ccel.org/ccel/edwards/sermons.sinners.html",

Thanks for sharing.emoticon_xgood\n That's it in a nutshell: the good and bad are within each of us and it is up to us to decide which one we will 'feed'.\n \n The book of Ephesians was one of my favorites, especially chapter 6:\n \n The Armor of God \n 10 Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. 11 Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes. 12 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. 13 Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. 14 Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, 15 and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. 16 In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. 17 Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. 18 And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints.\n \n Now I see, as did the Indian, that the 'evil forces' are not from some heavenly realm without but are, in fact, within us...and they are completely within our control.\n \n The choice is simple:\n either: \n A) Believe you have the inner strength to take control of and be fully responsible for the choices you make and the actions you take (which wolf you feed) or,\n B) Believe you are at the mercy of an invisible, supernatural, non-tangible \n force.\n \n I choose to put on the Armor but, I also choose to be in control.\n \n This discussion has been very enlightening.\n My question has finally been answered - to my satisfaction: \n Fear is what makes some/most/all? believe in God.\n Fear of sin, Fear of being immoral (whatever that is), Fear of not being forgiven, Fear of death and especially a Fear of the unknown.\n \n And Fear is what you get when you are not in control of a situation.\n \n This past two weeks I've also learned that an obsession with god is not only for the believers but, can also happen to a non-believer - one who tries to explain why they don't believe in god... and I don't like it now any more than I did then.\n \n So, feel free to continue this discussion but, I won't be participating as much as I have been.\n \n I'd rather spend my time feeding the Good Wolf. emoticon_xhoho\n \n Oh...one more thing, as much as I'd like to believe what Pappillion says about the future of the human race, the facts appear to me, as they do to Esdraelon, that the human race, as a whole, is fu**ed up. I'm afraid there are too many people feeding the Bad Wolf. emoticon_cry",

   "I never heard that story before - it's great! Thanks for sharing.emoticon_xgood\n\n \n I'm glad it was helpful, but I am going to respond here with a different perception.\n \n \nThat's it in a nutshell: the good and bad are within each of us and it is up to us to decide which one we will 'feed'.\n\n \n In a nutshell, that's correct, but as each of us is created in the image of God, the 'good', as scripture says, is the kingdom of heaven within us, in that image, as well as it is without.\n \n How is the wisdom of that book any different now than it was previously?\n \n \nThe Armor of God \n 10 Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. 11 Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes. 12 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. 13 Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. 14 Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, 15 and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. 16 In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. 17 Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. 18 And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints.\n\n \n That is correct, we are to put on the whole armor of God, for the fact of the matter is that Satan will delve into our weaknesses when we least expect, many times without us even knowing what is happening....until we have lost control. He gives us the impression we are in control when, in reality, he has us right where he wants us.\n \n \nNow I see, as did the Indian, that the 'evil forces' are not from some heavenly realm without but are, in fact, within us...and they are completely within our control.\n\n \n 'Heaven', is simply the 'atmosphere', just like hell is 'under the ground' from a literal definition. Satan is called the Prince of the Power of the Air. And yes, we have the capacity to do good or do evil. By default, however, you will likely concede that the evil wolf is the larger of the two since man has shown himself to have a greater capacity for evil than he does for good when he tries to be 'in control' by his own self.\n \n \nThe choice is simple:\n either: \n A) Believe you have the inner strength to take control of and be fully responsible for the choices you make and the actions you take (which wolf you feed) or,\n\n \n This is true to an extent.\n \n \n\n B) Believe you are at the mercy of an invisible, supernatural, non-tangible \n force.\n\n \n I don't see myself at the 'mercy' of anything. My choices are still my own, however, they generally go back to the response I made earlier as to \"WWJD\"? You think on it and pray on it but in the end, the choice IS yours. (What would Satan have you do?)\n \n \nI choose to put on the Armor but, I also choose to be in control.\n\n \n But you still have to utilize the armor for what it is otherwise you are not actually in control but subject to the forces of temptation (the other wolf)\n \n \nThis discussion has been very enlightening.\n My question has finally been answered - to my satisfaction: \n\n Possibly, but not exactly the way you expected.\n \n \nFear is what makes some/most/all? believe in God.\n\n \n No it is not. It is an understanding of God which makes one believe. People go about understanding God in a cavalierly manner and think they know all, but know nothing. They ask questions but never really seek an answer other than a selfish perception of that answer. This is the evil wolf rearing up, for when we disdain that 'image', we feed the evil wolf. The perception of God is not evil.\n \n \nFear of sin, Fear of being immoral (whatever that is), Fear of not being forgiven, Fear of death and especially a Fear of the unknown.\n\n \n And God has essentially given each of us the answer to each of your points above, and it does not entail 'fear'.\n \n \nAnd Fear is what you get when you are not in control of a situation.\n\n \n Face it, life is a series of basically uncontrollable events. There are things we CAN control, but also things not. I have a 31' sailboat that, for the most part, I sail and race myself with no crew. There is a myriad of things, controls, that I have to do alone which would be vastly easier if I had a crew of just ONE. When I go out for a leisurely sail, it's a 'breeze' to handle, but get out there in a 300 boat racing regatta, with boats within a few feet of you on all sides, close-hauled and sailing at full tilt, screaming at each other that they have the 'right of way', all fighting to be first around the next mark... you lose control of your boat, you are in a world of ----, much the same with life. I prefer having Christ as my first mate, He has never failed me.....neeeever! And, my friend, this is the first time I have EVER used this as an analogy.\n \n \nThis past two weeks I've also learned that an obsession with god is not only for the believers but, can also happen to a non-believer - one who tries to explain why they don't believe in god... and I don't like it now any more than I did then. \n\n \n There is NO call to obsess on God. If you truly were a Christian in the past, but no longer, even now, the Spirit never ceases to call. \n \n \nSo, feel free to continue this discussion but, I won't be participating as much as I have been.\n \n I'd rather spend my time feeding the Good Wolf. emoticon_xhoho\n\n \n Well, it's a start....\n \n \nOh...one more thing, as much as I'd like to believe what Pappillion says about the future of the human race, the facts appear to me, as they do to Esdraelon, that the human race, as a whole, is fu**ed up. I'm afraid there are too many people feeding the Bad Wolf. emoticon_cry\n\n \n No doubt, no doubt.",

   "Be that as it may, there is still no accounting that archaeological discoveries and associated radiometric dating has shown the earliest civilizations sprang up at approximately the same times, not only in Mesopotamia but also in the Americas. This is very curious. They appear to already have all the necessary 'law's, etc, necessary for a cohesive civilization, along with the ability to write them down. It's another 'missing link' where we go from a 'cave man' to 'civilized man' in one fell swoop. \n\n \n Yes we do have an answer. It's commonly referred to as weather. The last Ice Age had retreated enough to change the weather patterns and the majority of land that was covered over by the rising melt water had about peaked some 6000 - 5000 years ago. Man at this point was already shaping Gold, copper and tin and was learning about bronze. He was becoming much better at domesticating animals. \n \n The Sumerians were one of the first who actually settled for good, most of the other civilizations you are referreing to settled, but moved with the seasons. \n \n There is no missing link. Just as I described man didn't go from stone tools to cities. The nomadic tribes already had developed many of the skills associated with their cities. When they became farmers it was an expansion of skills already learned over the prior 5000 years. \n \n \nHowever, this is simply another hypothesis, by 'historians' to fill the gaps.\n\n \n The speculation you refer to is grounded on more solid evidence than the son of God born of a virgin being killed only to rise from the dead and float up to heaven with angels. And far better than God made us out of smart dirt.\n \n But you have no problem buying into that.\n \n \nImplications will be view within the prejudice of the viewers. Which 'cultures' are you actually implying? \n\n \n Not this time. Either Christian moral values are unique to the religion having not been influenced in their development by any other culture or not. Since it wasn't originated in a bubble and borrows heavely from Greek philosophy. It should be safe to say that they expanded on some older concepts and expanded others and came up with some new ones.\n \n \n \nHow do we 'know' other than personal assumption??\n\n \n Your right. It is possible Thor fighting Storm Giants is where thunder and lightning come from, it would be best to make sacrifices to the moon and sun to insure good weather and bountiful crops. There is enough war going on so Mars should be content. So who has the underworld, Arawn, Annubis, Hades or Satan?",

   "This is a 'rational explanation' rather like the one you espoused as to why man needed a 'god': now man needs something to explain his baser instincts. It reminds me of an old story, usually attributed to Native American sources, about two wolves. You may well have heard it before. The general story goes that a tribal elder is speaking to a young boy. \"My son, there are two wolves who are fighting within every person's heart: love and hate. You can hear them snarling if you lie very still and when one isn't looking the other will pounce. It is a great and terrible battle and the outcome will determine who you become.\" The young boy's eyes grow wide as he asks, \"But which wolf will win?\" The old man answers, \"The one you feed.\"\n\n \n No if I put God in there that would be man needing something to explain.\n The release of chemicals in response to experience is pretty solid science and is in response to your statement. Love and hate are the brains responses to experiences or are they another unexplainable God given mystery? \n \n \nI doubt that story ever actually happened, but it is a \"true\" story nonetheless. And the same truth is reflected in Paul's letter to the Philippians as he reminds a church facing persecution to focus on the positive-to feed the good wolf, if you will. Remember that Paul is writing this letter from prison, facing execution. The circumstances for both Paul and the church in Philippi are dire. The bad wolves are circling in both cases. But, even so, Paul encourages the church to think on the good, in order to give life to what is honorable, just, and pure even in the midst of great turmoil and evil.\n\n \n Ans through history we have examples of people doing noble and honorable things, overcoming impossible diversity and circumstances having never heard of Jesus, God or Paul. Conceptual thought is one of the things that distinguishes us from 95% of the animal world. You can argue God made smart dirt, but the brain of man is responsible for a great many thing.\n \n [/QUOTE]I believe you are simply whistling through the grave-yard. All things being equal, man is far worse today than he was 5000 years ago. Duh? Just look at the world as a whole. You may have a comfortable existence in this country, but have no concept of the hell man has created for other men elsewhere.[/QUOTE]\n \n I think you need to move to a better part of Atlanta if you think our society overall is no better than it was 5000 years ago. Granted I was only there for a weekend but it seemed much nicer than what you making it out to be.",

   "That's your opinion. Not one that I happen to share. For instance, the first people to master speech and written word weren't farmers, they were priests of some sort. It was the priest that held primitive societies together. He was the wise man, the doctor and took on a host of roles in early society. \n\n \n I know they were not farmers. Agriculture was one of the last pieces of the puzzle. Once they settled at farming though is when things start to develop quickly. You keep going from caveman to city man, but there was a long period of time between the two. I agree that the priest class developed into the intellectual elite and were vital for measuring the seasons and usually only they could read and write and did become places of knowledge. In some cultures they were more important than in others. But there is no evidence that man has religion from his beginnings. There is evidence that he did not. The development of speech, the role of the \"older male\" of the tribe played significantly in forming the wise man, medicine man and priest.\n \n \nEarly cave drawings were made by members of small family clans, not civilivations, so they are irrelevant to the argument about civilization.\n\n \n No they are without question relevant. Those tribes grew into larger tribes which in turn became the people that settled and grew in civilizations. You can't ignore 3000+ years of development and think all of sudden poof man woke up and God had provided hi with cities and language.\n \n \n \nI already explained the origin of Judeo/Christian beliefs. They trace back to the Code of Hammurabi.\n \n Religion was a way to control the masses. That control is called civilization. You agree with me on the concept but refuse to acknowledge the positive aspect that religion brought to early civilizations. It was the glue that held societies together.\n\n \n We are hung up on semantics. I will agree that it became an necessary part of society and was of significant importance to the continuation of civilized growth, but it didn't start out that way, but I will state it developed early in history while man was in the later stages of the nomadic tribe phase.",

That means, that viola! as with Penn and Tellers magically restored sash, there would be no need to appeal to the miraculous to explain away what was shrouded in mystery.\n \n Nuclear physicist Hugh Siefken: \"My faith can be summed up in this one paradox: I believe in science, and I believe in God.\" \"And I plan to continue to testifying to both.\" He and many, many other scientists see no inherent conflict between their profession and their conclusion that a miracle-working God is responsible for creating and sustaining the universe.",

The choices we make determine our chances of facing a disaster and surviving (or not) - not god.\n Unfortunately, the choices others make cause disaster to come to us and in those times you just need to find the inner strength to deal with it and move on if you can.\n There is no guarantee that a belief in god will shield you from harm and in fact, a false sense of security may even prevent you from avoiding harm in the first place.\n \n Choosing to participate in a dangerous boat race greatly increases your chances of meeting disaster. So does your choice of what you eat & drink and where you live, the people you associate with and so on.\n Sometimes we just happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. There is no mystery about it. It's just the way Nature works.\n \n I can still see how some will find comfort in Psalm 91 and I do too to a certain extent but, the strength I require comes from within and not from the heavens. Maybe it is a 'God', I don't know. But, I do know that the strength and peacefulness is there just the same whether or not I acknowledge God...which is proof enough to me that I do not need to believe in the Christian God to live a 'godly' life.\n \n As I said earlier: Fear is the underlying reason for believing in the Christian God and comfort and protection is the desired result.\n \n If I don't want to strike my foot against a stone, I had better watch where I am going...and if I tread on a lion and a cobra I'll most likely end up dead - as will any believer in the bible.",

They proceeded to knot it up and down and cut it in the middle. Then with a big flourish, they shook out the cloth and viola! It was one piece again. \"What do you think?\" Penn asked the little boy, \"was that a miracle or a magic trick?\" The little boy didn't hesitate \"A trick!\" He stated confidently. \n \n A mere child it seems has the ability to discern that when we can't quite understand what might have caused a mysterious event, there's still undoubtedly a reasonable explanation apart from the miraculous.\n\n \n And yet I would bet that mere child at one point believed in Santa, Easter Bunny and things that go bump in the night. \n \n What changed that man is able to realize that what he sees or is told is not always the obvious reason? \n \n \nRichard Dawkins, atheist, stated: \"We are working on.... a complete understanding of the universe and everything in it.\" A tall order for man, wouldn't you say? That means, that viola! as with Penn and Tellers magically restored sash, there would be no need to appeal to the miraculous to explain away what was shrouded in mystery.\n \n Nuclear physicist Hugh Siefken: \"My faith can be summed up in this one paradox: I believe in science, and I believe in God.\" \"And I plan to continue to testifying to both.\" He and many, many other scientists see no inherent conflict between their profession and their conclusion that a miracle-working God is responsible for creating and sustaining the universe.\n\n \n My arguments are typically not directed at the existence of God, but at man's concept of God and the ways he uses God. It is religion that insists God and science are not compatible (in general, exceptions do exist) I would like to think and hope that God is more intelligent than 1st century man was and more than 21st century man gives him credit for.\n \n As I told AA a better argument is God gave man the capacity for morals and man developed them over time or moral values are a gauge used by God to measure man's evolution or something similar. To me that is a much more plausible concept than smart or sympathetic dirt. \n \n It still leaves God as the originator while not ignoring the discoveries of science. The two can be compatible, but it requires religion to rethink it's understanding of God.",

These people are disgusting, spineless, and spiritually-dead individuals and should be voted out of office as soon as possible.\n\n \n Don't worry about Stupid. He'll get his. The Republicans in Michigan are already in gear. Here's one targeting another Michigan Democrat that voted for the bill, Gary Peters. Check this out:\n \n\n \n Rally at Gary Peters' office to Blow the Whistle on the Peters-Pelosi Health Care Takeover\n What: Join Rocky to protest the government takeover of health care\n \n Where: U.S. Rep. Gary Peters' Office, 560 Kirts Blvd, Troy, Michigan\n \n When: Noon, Monday, March 22, 2010\n \n Why: Because the sooner we beat Gary Peters, the sooner we can fix the \n damage he's done.\n \n Together, we can fix this! The 219-212 vote tonight for government-run health care is not the end. There is hope, and the first step is beating Gary Peters and winning a conservative majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. \n ________________________________________\n \n A very personal message from Rocky...\n \n Today's health care vote is especially important to me and my family because I am a veteran who happens to be a VA user and I pay for health care through a system called Tri-care! What the US House of Representatives did today will not only affect me personally, but will also affect ALL of us!\n \n I took a deep breath watching the vote and realized that we've reached a crossroads in American history, a time unlike any I can remember in my life. In the past, big decisions were made with the majority of the people onboard and in support. Now, for the first time in my memory, a partisan majority in Congress - including Democrat Gary Peters - is ramming through legislation that affects every American and that is opposed by a majority of Americans.\n \n This health care takeover is the wrong prescription for our country, especially now, with our economy still struggling and families hurting. Whatever happened to the economy being the number 1 issue? Instead, we are dealing with \"Don't ask - Don't tell\" and so-called \"health care reform\".\n \n This is not about health care, but about government control. Like minds can disagree, but most individuals would never want our neighbors to go without health care, so that is why I support the Republican plan for:\n 1. Allowing more health care competition across state lines.\n 2. Fixing Medicaid for the needy and repairing the unfunded mandates put on doctors and the states by the federal government.\n 3. Allowing all individuals and businesses to deduct spending on health insurance.\n Instead of working on the above issues, our Congress is passing legislation that is wrong for ALL of us. Here are just the top ten (10) reasons why:\n 1. It's wrong for senior citizens who will suffer from more than $500 billion in Medicare cuts.\n 2. It's wrong for families who will be forced to change doctors and drop out of health plans they like.\n 3. It's wrong for employers who face more than $50 billion in new job-killing taxes.\n 4. It's wrong for the states because they'll face even more unfunded Medicaid mandates.\n 5. It's wrong for the most vulnerable among us because it uses taxpayer dollars to pay for abortion.\n 6. It's wrong for veterans because it doesn't protect the health care services provided to veterans and their families. \n 7. It's wrong because it threatens our freedom and gives the IRS $10 billion to force citizens to comply.\n 8. It's wrong for America's future, because the massive trillion dollar increase in spending is burying future generations in debt.\n 9. It's wrong because the Federal government will end up paying for illegal immigrant healthcare.\n 10. And it's wrong because now government will control about a third (1/3) of our economy!\n But we can do something about it. If we come together, we can beat the current representative, Gary Peters, and take back the U.S. House of Representatives and make this right again! We need your help!\n \n With your help, a new conservative majority in Congress can begin to undo the damage and restore a basic commitment to Constitutional principles.\n \n So, visit our website, Rocky Raczkowski for U.S. Congress, supporting the repeal of government-run health care, sign our national petition, volunteer and please make a donation to our cause.\n \n Together, we'll get America back on the right track.\n \n Rocky Raczkowski\n Candidate to be Your U.S. Representative\n Michigan's 9th District\n \n",

Talk about biased, brother you win the award\n\n \n You don't think Obama and his puppets engaged in fear-mongering during this debate?!!!\n \n \n Excerpt from Obama's March 3rd speech. It's loaded with fear-mongering. \n \n\n Democrats and Republicans agree that this is a serious problem for America. And we agree that if we do nothing -- if we throw up our hands and walk away -- it's a problem that will only grow worse. Nobody disputes that. More Americans will lose their family's health insurance if they switch jobs or lose their job. More small businesses will be forced to choose between health care and hiring. More insurance companies will deny people coverage who have preexisting conditions, or they'll drop people's coverage when they get sick and need it most. And the rising cost of Medicare and Medicaid will sink our government deeper and deeper and deeper into debt. On all of this we agree.\n \n On the other end of the spectrum, there are those, and this includes most Republicans in Congress, who believe the answer is to loosen regulations on the insurance industry -- whether it's state consumer protections or minimum standards for the kind of insurance they can sell. The argument is, is that that will somehow lower costs. I disagree with that approach. I'm concerned that this would only give the insurance industry even freer rein to raise premiums and deny care. \n So I don't believe we should give government bureaucrats or insurance company bureaucrats more control over health care in America. I believe it's time to give the American people more control over their health care and their health insurance. I don't believe we can afford to leave life-and-death decisions about health care to the discretion of insurance company executives alone. I believe that doctors and nurses and physician assistants like the ones in this room should be free to decide what's best for their patients.\n \n Essentially, my proposal would change three things about the current health care system. First, it would end the worst practices of insurance companies. No longer would they be able to deny your coverage because of a preexisting condition. No longer would they be able to drop your coverage because you got sick. No longer would they be able to force you to pay unlimited amounts of money out of your own pocket. No longer would they be able to arbitrarily and massively raise premiums like Anthem Blue Cross recently tried to do in California -- up to 39 percent increases in one year in the individual market. Those practices would end. \n \n\n And that's just a small portion of one speech that didn't include the obscure personal case histories of people screwed by the current system that Congress so loves. \n Curiously, I didn't see one example of a Medicare patient screwed by all of the red tape reated to Medicare or the refusals for treatment that will result as they cut $500Billion from the program, so there certainly wasn't any attempt by liberals to portray reality. emoticon_rolleyes",

Henry Waxman, chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, has summoned some of the nation's top executives to Capitol Hill to defend their assessment that the new national health care reform law will cost their companies hundreds of millions of dollars in health insurance expenses. Waxman is also demanding that the executives give lawmakers internal company documents related to health care finances -- a move one committee Republican describes as \"an attempt to intimidate and silence opponents of the Democrats' flawed health care reform legislation.\"\n On Thursday and Friday, the companies -- so far, they include AT&T, Verizon, Caterpillar, Deere, Valero Energy, AK Steel and 3M -- said a tax provision in the new health care law will make it far more expensive to provide prescription drug coverage to their retired employees. Now, both retirees and current employees of those companies are wondering whether the new law could mean reduced or canceled benefits for them in the future.\n The news is an embarrassment for Democrats. As President Obama and congressional leaders tout the purported benefits of the new health care law, some of the nation's biggest companies are saying it will mean higher costs and fewer benefits -- not exactly what Democrats want to hear in the days after their historic victory.\n Democrats threaten companies hit hard by health care bill | Washington Examiner\n \n\n \n\n \n Tell you what I know this guy who is expecting some money from a banking deal he is doing in Nigeria.

Fat lazy slobs who don't have to pay for their own doctor bills have no incentive to prevent illness.\n \n Who said everyone has the right to open heart surgery?\n What's next, everyone has the right to eat steak instead of hotdogs?\n \n Life has never been 'fair'. :xbanghead\n \n If you want something bad enough, you should work hard for it - not sit on your XXX and demand that someone give it to you.

Even with an insurance system you pay for other people's healthcare, indeed that's the entire point.\n\n \n My buddy owns his own business and told me he couldn't afford health insurance. Two years ago, he had a heart attack and surgery. His bill was $106,000 IIRC. If he couldn't afford insurance, he certainly couldn't afford NOT to have it afterwards.\n \n \nThat's hardly the point at all. Since when do advocates of socialized healthcare only want catastrophic cases covered? You might have a point if that were the case, but it's not like you're limiting your view to such cases.\n\n \n Exactly. Proponents of socialized medicine want Uncle Sam to pay for 100% for X-rays on stubbed toes too. \n \n \nThat's entirely the point when someone is advocating everyone paying for their healthcare themselves.\n\n \n Not true. I'm in favor of healthcare insurance that is like car insurance. It pays for catastrophic costs but not for minor stuff. I have a $1000 deductible limit on my car insurance, but it covers me to $2Million in costs.",

From laboratory testing of the chemical on rats, researchers have discovered that the drug induces brain tumors. On Sept 30, 1980 the Board of Inquiry of the FDA concurred and denied the petition for approval.\n \n In 1981, the newly appointed FDA Commissioner, Arthur Hull Hayes, ignored the negative ruling and approved aspartame for dry goods. As recorded in the Congressional Record of 1985, then CEO of Searle Laboratories Donald Rumsfeld said that he would \"call in his markers\" to get aspartame approved. Rumsfeld was on President Reagan's transition team and a day after taking office appointed Hayes. No FDA Commissioner in the previous sixteen years had allowed aspartame on the market....\n \n \"When Donald Rumsfeld was CEO of Searle, that conglomerate manufactured aspartame. For 16 years the FDA refused to approve it, not only because its not safe but because they wanted the company indicted for fraud. Both U.S. Prosecutors hired on with the defense team and the statute of limitations expired. They were Sam Skinner and William Conlon. Skinner went on to become Secretary of Transportation squelching the cries of the pilots who were now having seizures on this seizure triggering drug, aspartame, and then Chief of Staff under President Bush's father. Some of these people reach high places. Even Supreme Justice Clarence Thomas is a former Monsanto attorney. (Monsanto bought Searle in 1985, and sold it a few years ago).

Almost 70,000 gallons of Roundup were sprayed in Colombia in the first months of 2001. In 2000, roughly 145,750 gallons were sprayed over 53,000 hectares (205 square miles). With a retail price between $33 to $45 per gallon (Monsanto refused to confirm the wholesale price for such volumes), this represents a cost of around $4.8 to $6.6 million - paid to Monsanto by US taxpayers.\n Monsanto boasted almost $5.5 billion in sales in 2000 and nearly $150 million in profits. Roundup is the world's leading herbicide and the company's flagship product. Monsanto is also involved in developing biotech agriculture and has manufactured \"Roundup Ready\" soybeans and other crops that resist the herbicide. George W Bush's agriculture secretary, Ann Veneman, was on the board of Calgene, a biotechnology company that was purchased by Monsanto.

So, aside from spending huge sums of its own money (none of it federal bailout money) to influence the outcome, it went to the office of the voting registrar in downtown Detroit. It sought to sign up, affirming that it was a citizen and resident of Michigan. Denied registration, it sued, claiming that, under the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, it was a \"person,\" and, as a \"citizen,\" it was entitled to equal protection under the election laws. Would the Supreme Court buy that?\n \n \n General Motors might already be halfway to winning its lawsuit. It has been understood, for decades, that corporations are \"persons\" under the Constitution. And nothing the Supreme Court said Thursday undermined that notion. If anything, the decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission conferred new dignity on corporate \"persons,\" treating them - under the First Amendment free-speech clause - as the equal of human beings.\n \n At least in politics, the Court majority indicated, corporations have a voice, and they have worthy political ideas. Here is the way Justice Anthony M. Kennedy put it (partially quoting from an earlier ruling): \"Corporations and other associations, like individuals, contribute to the 'discussion, debate, and the dissemination of information and ideas' that the First Amendment seeks to foster.\"\n \n It does not matter that the right-to-vote scenario is quite implausible. The fact is that the decades-old image of American corporations as a destabilizing and perhaps even corrupting influence in politics has now been thoroughly re-examined by the Supreme Court, and the corporate \"person\" emerges from the process with - in the eyes of the majority - a burnished image of good citizen. There is a deep chasm of perception, between Thursday's majority and the dissenters, about the nature of the corporate personality.\n SCOTUSblog Analysis: The personhood of corporations \n\n \n Not so absurd after all, is it? emoticon_rolleyes",

Insurance companies would still issue and manage policies. The cost would be covered by savings and taxes. The tax burden would be shared between government (state and Fed), employers and individuals. Incentives for employers who hire could be given to help offset additional cost. Individuals could be allowed greater medical deduction or portion of premium unused. Insurance companies could have profits segregated between typical products and mandatory taxing at different rates or restricting allowable expense. Similar to AMT. The structure (to be kept simple) could make it worthwhile to make mandatory policies competitive in both cost and coverage.\n \n I couldn't tell you if something like this could work dollar wise, but seems to address some of the larger concerns outside of actual cost.\n",

I can assure you that the only case where people see this as moral is in the specific case of government.\n \n The only reason such a blind spot can be explained is because society has taught everyone that it is absolutely necessary to have government AND that government absolutely requires taxes.\n\n \n Government is necessary. You may argue how much or what authority it possess, but it is necessary. Even bad government serves a role in maintaining stability and management of the nation. \n \n An effective government must have the resources to successfully fulfill its purpose otherwise there is no point in its existence. Government involvement in industry would be contradictory with the concept of our capitalist society and create conflicts of interest.\n \n Taxes are therefore necessary to the extent that they provide the means of Government to perform it's mandated function. \n \n \nOnce that question is answered the second one is much easier, two wrongs don't and can't make a right.\n\n \n Again, it isn't right or wrong but necessary and unnecessary. Either view though is subjective. What is right or necessary for one may not be for another. It may also be what is wrong or unnecessary for the individual is not so for society.\n \n \nThe battle here is over the rights of man, it is the same battle that this country was formed on.\n\n \n Even the founders accepted that having rights entailed having responsibilities which come with obligations that may cost some of those rights they fought for. \n \n \nWe are not arguing about the practical choices this country is making we are arguing about the moral choices.\n \n The sooner everyone realizes this the better.\n \n So you see I believe I am moving to the core of the matter and bypassing as much rhetoric as possible by going straight to taxes.\n\n \n The argument is the wants and needs of individuals vs the wants and needs of the society.

Right and wrong.\n\n \n Just two, rather limiting. How are they applicable to chewing gum?\n \n \nMorality is an attribute of an action committed by a sentient being, it has two possible values right and wrong.\n\n \n Along with several hundred definitions. What is right? \n \n \nTo say that morality has shades or degrees is to say that an action can be partially right and partially wrong.\n\n \n No it is to say that an act can be both acceptable and unacceptable.\n \n \nI have never heard of, or imagined such an action.\n \n\n \n To kill is morally wrong. Yet there is capital punishment, there is war and there are accidents. \n \n \nDo not confuse right and wrong with the seriousness or degree of a crime and it's subsequent punishment.\n\n \n I am not but you are. The crime is a distinct event separate fro mthe punishment. You want to combine them as cause and effect.\n \n \nThe fact that it is a crime and that there is a punishment is proof that the morality was evaluated to be wrong, not right. (do you punish someone for doing the right thing?)\n\n \n Who defines what is a crime? Man and society.\n \n \nThere are many collectivist notions that further contribute to confusion such as considering motives to be a moral subject, only actions can be moral or immoral and the only morality involved with someones intentions is whether those intentions are to commit an immoral act.\n\n \n Exactly so crime and punishment are distinct from each other. Therefore capital punishment is immoral if you believe killing another human being is immoral. The intent is irrelevant if only the action can be moral or not.\n \n \nAlso there are no collective actions, all collective observations are abstractions of the sum of individuals.\n\n \n In other words majority rules.\n \n \n \nAmerica may be partially right and partially wrong because it once had slavery and once defeated Nazism.

The decision to fight for freedom against evil is right, not 60% right.\n\n \n Did the ones who made what you refer to as the right decision have more rights than those who made the wrong decision? Are they completely moral or completely immoral\n \n \n \nI ask that you throw away these meaningless fallacies and consider only what you call morality.\n\n \n Until you can show they are meaningless or fallacies I don't see any reason to do so. Simply your not wanting to acknowledge them does not make them so.\n \n \nIs it morality - the evaluation of right or wrong, the desire for justice? or is it \"morality\" - a general positive or negative emotional experience attached to observing human behavior?\n\n \n Since morality is learned behavior it can be both or ethics and morality.\n \n \nThat is correct, if muggers had a police force and the power to remove your assets from secure locations without your consent they wouldn't be mugging you in the night.\n\n \n Unfortunately we live in a world that does not always share your version of justice, morality and ethics. Would you feel the world a better place if there was no mechanism for the enforcement of these concepts? Most criminals do not confess their wrong doing and the few who most likely would not if their was no means to implement the rule of law.\n \n \nYou are incorrect, perhaps you should listen to Rush Limbaugh if you want to know what the right in general thinks.\n\n \n Why? He is an entertainer that caters to a specific audience demographic. If I wanted a distortion or biased view of the facts then perhaps, but I look to other more reliable and credible sources for information.\n \n \nGoogle objectivism, I do not believe morality is subjective so I reject any notion that moral judgement must be withheld except as mere preference.\n\n \n Sorry you feel that way, but it still is learned behavior. History and the development of various cultures prove that over and over again.\n \n The fact that you believe it to be something is evidence supporting that.\n \n \nPeople did not vote for lazy, lack of business sense, resourcefulness and lateral logic in the last election.\n\n \n Some did and got it. Some did in the previous election and got it and so on and so on until you reach a point going forward where there is a shift from representing the people and the states to fighting for the party. \n \n The fact that the pool from which potential candidates are selected is sub-par doesn't help much either.\n \n \nThe left pursues high taxes and gives the people a moral imperative as their reason, no matter what the actual reason is for many of them the movement is based of the sense that they are doing something necessary and compassionate.\n\n \n Vs the Right which think they are just doing what is necessary? \n If motivation doesn't matter on whether an act is moral or not then the reason isn't relevant.\n \n \nYes I know, it is so inconvenient when you have to ask to play with someone else's toys.\n\n \n That is probably why the right doesn't bother any more with asking, it just takes and then lies about it if caught.\n \n \nDo you see theft as a moral issue?\n \n \n Yes, but you have yet to offer anything to suggest that taxes are theft and therefor immoral.\n \n \nDo you know what morality is?\n\n Yes, but you seem not to be.\n \n \nof, pertaining to, or concerned with the principles or rules of right conduct or the distinction between right and wrong; ethical: moral attitudes. \n\n \n Define what is moral and what is not.

What right does one have to impose that idea onto another? Is it moral and ethical to do so?\n \n \nIf an action is wrong, it is a moral issue, regardless of who sees it as necessary.\n\n \n What if? You started this by saying all actions are moral or immoral. \n \n Why would anyone do something immoral, but necessary. Is it then necessary to be immoral? Is it unnecessary to be moral? Why would a moral person permit such a thing? \n \n \nYour sight must be extended.\n\n \n Your mind must be expanded.\n \n \nI don't believe a statement could cause a greater amount of outrage in me than that. It is so blatantly irrational that it pushes the limits of what I would consider responding to.\n\n \n Sorry to hear that. I am sure I am not the first nor will I be the last. It is an unfortunate result of Democracy. \n \n \nI demand you justify that statement, I demand you explain how you can prove that I or anyone else have given consent to something we specifically protest.\n\n \n Do you live in the United States of America? By staying you consent to be governed by the laws of the state you live in and the country that that state belongs to.\n \n \nWhen was this consent implied? When we failed to commit suicide because we saw society was unjust?\n\n \n Do something to change it if you don't agree. That right is one of the trade-offs the government gives to govern. \n \n \nThe Jews could vote before Hitler took power, slaves in the south could buy themselves if they saved enough money.\n \n A man never loses his rights, it does not matter that he is not completely helpless to retain their protection.\n\n \n I didn't know Hitler's rise to power was via military coup nor that slavery was still legal in the United States. Things change don't they.\n \n Who establishes these rights? Who enforces them? Who insures they are practiced?\n \n \n \nWhat of every person who voted for freedom and did not receive it. They participated and the government did not act according to their desire to have liberty.\n \n When you say this; it an eloquent disguise to the belief that majority makes right.\n\n \n That is a really weak argument. If 6 out of 10 vote that every person should be allowed to own a slave do we allow slavery? \n \n \nthe protection of human rights are necessary, everything else is an extrapolation on that premise.\n\n \n And how do you propose Government go about getting the resources to effectively protect human rights? Everything else is still everything else. You can't minimize the cost by trivializing the extent of the responsibility.\n \n \nI am not interested in arguing how much, I have a very specific notion of what authority it could morally posses, that is exactly the authority of one person.\n\n \n When you can see past yourself you might start to understand. Until then go be by yourself if that is what you want. I am certainly not preventing you from doing so.\n \n \nWhy?\n\n \n You see no potential for conflict between profit and law makers involved in business? \n \n How big would you like your government to be?\n \n \nYour arguements up til this point do not support this conclusion deductively.\n\n \n Your misunderstanding of my arguments is a bigger factor for this than anything else.\n \n \n/Government needs money\n //Government needs taxes\n \n You can see you are missing a premise\n \n /Government needs money\n /taxation is the only way for government to gain money\n //Government needs taxes\n \n The second is valid the first invalid. Let me have a go:\n \n /Government needs money to protect rights\n /taxation is the only way for government to gain money\n //Government needs taxes\n \n /taxes violate rights\n /government needs taxes to protect rights \n //Government cannot protect rights\n //Government is useless\n\n \n How convenient.\n \n \nThe incorrect premise \"taxation is the only way for government to gain money\" is why so many have a hard time seeing the truth, which is:\n \n /Government needs money to protect rights\n /taxation is not the only way for government to gain money\n //Government does not need taxes\n \n /taxes violate rights\n /government does not need taxes to protect rights \n //Government can protect rights provided it does not tax\n //Government is not useless\n\n \n \n A lot of assumption, unsubstantiated conjecture and comparisons of unlike presumptions do not make for compelling evidence. \n \n \nAgain, If you do not think it is wrong then you cannot think theft is wrong.\n\n \n If you can not think you are wrong then it does not matter what I think until I agree with you.\n \n \nThat shield is thrown up against impending defeat in the rational arena, it cannot be penetrated but I cannot be struck through it.\n \n Meaning that if you stick to that joke of a piece of knowledge I will consider this argument won albeit with no reward.\n\n \n You will think that way regardless. Your mind is made up. As you say you refuse to accept certain ideas. If that is the case then what other possible outcome is there?\n \n \nThey must be.\n\n \n Why? Because you say so?\n \n \nIs society good company? I haven't spoken to him in a while... Wait that's right you just attempted to use a collectivist abstraction to make a point.\n \n Society is a group of individuals, when you say that what is wrong for an individual might not be what is wrong for a group of individuals all you are saying is that some men have greater rights than others because there are more of them.\n\n \n When a group of 20 people vote and 9 vote one way and 11 the other, does that mean the 11 have more rights than the 9? Are the 9 to be considered oppressed because they are in the minority in this vote?\n \n \nThat if true is irrelevant.\n\n \n That is true and is relevant.\n \n \nThat's your argument, argued against imaginary foes who accept your faulty axiom of collective ethics.\n \n My argument is the rights of individuals vs anyone who would violate them.\n\n \n No your argument is about your personal beliefs and how government effects you personally. Other individuals do not concern you unless they concur with you.\n \n \nNone of it stems from any belief in the practical abilities of any government, and I destroy faith if I ever see it infecting me.\n\n \n You have faith your right, don you not?",

   "Is chewing gum ethical?\n\n Yes\n \nIs posting on a messaging forum ethical?\n\n Yes\n \nNot every action in life is requires an ethical decision.\n\n You mean you don't make the decision twice, when performing an action you have never taken before you do consider the moral value, or you should.\n \n Just because it takes less than a second to see most actions cannot be wrong does not mean you ignore right and wrong.\n \n \n \nI wish you well with that. \n\n Thank you\n \n \n \nJust two, rather limiting. How are they applicable to chewing gum?\n\n That which is not right is wrong, that which is not right is wrong.\n \n \n \nAlong with several hundred definitions. What is right? \n\n Right is that which is not wrong, wrong is an attribute of actions which are taken due to thought in contradiction with rational knowledge i.e. reality.\n \n \n \nNo it is to say that an act can be both acceptable and unacceptable.\n\n It is also to say that.\n \n \n \nTo kill is morally wrong.\n\n To murder is wrong, I have personally consumed the bodies of thousands of plants and aninimals, some of the plants I killed myself.\n \n \nYet there is capital punishment, there is war and there are accidents. \n\n Try some logic, you would find the existence of immorality does not negate it's existance emoticon_xhoho\n \n \n \nI am not but you are. The crime is a distinct event separate fro mthe punishment. You want to combine them as cause and effect.\n\n Red herring \n \n \nWho defines what is a crime? Man and society.\n\n This point appears meaningless.\n \n \nExactly so crime and punishment are distinct from each other. Therefore capital punishment is immoral if you believe killing another human being is immoral. The intent is irrelevant if only the action can be moral or not.\n\n I am glad you understand.\n \n \nIn other words majority rules.\n\n Yes, that is why to cloak meaning or authority under one of these abstractions is a disguise for majority makes right.\n \n \nDid the ones who made what you refer to as the right decision have more rights than those who made the wrong decision?\n\n Everyone has the same rights.\n \n Are they completely moral or completely immoral\n\n A person can't be completely moral unless every action they take is moral, every action must be completely moral or immoral.\n \n \nUntil you can show they are meaningless or fallacies I don't see any reason to do so. Simply your not wanting to acknowledge them does not make them so.\n\n It is self-evident; I cannot force rationality on you. Indeed it seemed you already accepted my advice and discarded the fallacies.\n \n One does not ponder how to prove something to a man who boasts he cares not for evidence.\n \n \n \nSince morality is learned behavior it can be both or ethics and morality.\n\n \n Morality is not a behavior it is a concept, being moral is a behavior.\n Being moral is accepting and acting in accordance to the right.\n \n\n Unfortunately we live in a world that does not always share your version of justice, morality and ethics. Would you feel the world a better place if there was no mechanism for the enforcement of these concepts?\n\n No\n \nMost criminals do not confess their wrong doing and the few who most likely would not if their was no means to implement the rule of law.\n\n Yes\n \n \nWhy?\n\n He is a good gauge of the right wing of the country.\n \nHe is an entertainer that caters to a specific audience demographic.\n\n He is entertaining, he caters to the right, and he believes every word he says.\n \nIf I wanted a distortion or biased view of the facts then perhaps, but I look to other more reliable and credible sources for information.\n\n You won't find a more reliable source for the conservative movement.\n \n \nSorry you feel that way, but it still is learned behavior. \n\n Being moral is a learned behavior; want to put your point in standard premise conclusion form?\n \nHistory and the development of various cultures prove that over and over again.\n\n Yes, many very good examples of immorality.\n \n \nThe fact that you believe it to be something is evidence supporting that.\n\n A is believed\n Therefore A is subjective\n \n Invalid \n \n \n\n The fact that the pool from which potential candidates are selected is sub-par doesn't help much either.\n\n I agree\n \n \nVs the Right which think they are just doing what is necessary? \n\n In reference to taxes yes, most consider high taxes wrong but have irrational reasons to think so, many will just fall back on economic practicality for explanation.\n \n \nIf motivation doesn't matter on whether an act is moral or not then the reason isn't relevant.\n\n Ultimately yes, for practical purposes you should examine a reason (which is not exactly the same as motivation) to see if it is sound, it may be that one's moral judgment is incorrect.\n \n \nThat is probably why the right doesn't bother any more with asking, it just takes and then lies about it if caught.\n\n I am pleased you have principles; it was looking sketchy with the neo-kantian XXXX earlier.\n \n \nYes, but you have yet to offer anything to suggest that taxes are theft and therefor immoral.\n\n If you cannot name a meaningful difference then you must admit that as far as you know taxes could be theft.\n \n Argument by definition:\n \n steal - to take (the property of another or others without permission or right, esp. secretly or by force: A pickpocket stole his watch. \n \n theft  - the act of stealing; the wrongful taking and carrying away of the personal goods or property of another; larceny.\n \n Tax - a sum of money demanded by a government for its support or for specific facilities or services, levied upon incomes, property, sales, etc.\n \n Theft is the taking without permission or right, or by force not the unlawful taking.\n \n To tax is to demand regardless of consent (permission), and to be prepared to force to comply.\n \n Taxation is theft.\n \n \nYes, but you seem not to be.\n\n Conformity to the rules of right conduct; moral or virtuous conduct. \n \n \n Define what is moral and what is not.\n \n Right - in conformity with fact, reason, truth, or some standard or principle; correct:\n \n Wrong - not in accordance with what is morally right or good: a wrong deed. \n \n \n \nWhy does what you consider moral and immoral and what you consider ethical or unethical not universally accepted as such?\n\n I am not perfectly knowledgeable, so I will consider the question to be \"why isn't a single morality universally accepted\"\n \n Irrationality, failure to pursue the truth without accepting compromise.\n \n \nWho is right and who is wrong?\n\n Wrong for social purposes, which means for the purposes of anything I would be interested in arguing about; is that which contradicts the principle of volition.\n \n Volition is a principle which proceeds directly from man's nature; he has a mind and survives by thinking.\n \n He acts in accordance with his thought.\n \n Failure to recognize that volition (aka liberty, freedom) is good is failure to recognize man survives by reason.\n \nWhat right does one have to impose that idea onto another?\n\n No one will or ever has had the right to impose any idea onto another for any reason, regardless of any excuse.\n \n Is it moral and ethical to do so?\n\n No\n \n \n \nWhat if? You started this by saying all actions are moral or immoral. \n\n I do not understand.\n \nWhy would anyone do something immoral, but necessary.\n\n There exists no situation in which something is both necessary and immoral, I did not set this as a law or anything I just discovered it was the case in every moral analysis I have done since I fully formed my philosophy.\n \n We have said necessary in a vacuum, If anything was found to be both I would then declare that whatever something is \"necessary\" for should be discarded.\n \n \n Is it then necessary to be immoral? Is it unnecessary to be moral? Why would a moral person permit such a thing? \n\n They would not.\n \n \nYour mind must be expanded.\n\n I am working on that.\n \n \n \nSorry to hear that.

   "I've enjoyed the exchange between you and Pappillion - you are both Master Debaters! emoticon_xhoho - not I.emoticon_rolleyes\n I have some comments...\n \n \n\n \n ...If you cannot name a meaningful difference then you must admit that as far as you know taxes could be theft....\n \n Argument by definition:\n \n steal - to take (the property of another or others without permission or right, esp. secretly or by force: A pickpocket stole his watch. \n \n theft  - the act of stealing; the wrongful taking and carrying away of the personal goods or property of another; larceny.\n \n Tax - a sum of money demanded by a government for its support or for specific facilities or services, levied upon incomes, property, sales, etc.\n \n Theft is the taking without permission or right, or by force not the unlawful taking.\n \n To tax is to demand regardless of consent (permission), and to be prepared to force to comply.\n \n Taxation is theft.\n\n I have to agree with you on this one...to a point. Unfortunately, in our democratic government, our elected officials decide whether or not to tax for certain activities or programs. We can vote for individuals who claim to think the way we do but once in office they can and usually do change and go to the side that is most profitable and beneficial for them...not the community as a whole.\n If I object to my tax $$ being spent to build a new school or a new road on the other side of the county, it's tough noogies for me...but the community, as a whole benefits from my tax $$.\n While the concept of individual rights and preferences sounds appealing, it is also being selfish...especially if one ever leaves their own property to travel, work, shop or attend school.\n \n \n \n...ROFL, unlike the real dictators of the past we give you the opportunity to leave oppression.\n \n No, this earth is not someone else's to withhold from me should I decline to submit to their irrationality.\n \n I should not have to leave my home because a group of people with guns decided they had the right to make me go.\n \n I do not consent to taxation; I do not consent to leave. By what right would you force me to do either? \n\n No, this earth is not someone else's to withhold from me should I decline to submit to their irrationality.\n I really like this statement. emoticon_xgood\n Unfortunately, in the real world, it does not apply. It never has nor could it ever.\n 'Society' and living in a 'community' makes it otherwise. The only way your statement could be true is for a lone individual living on a deserted island - one that no government has any interest in possessing for logistics or resources. No such place exists on the face of this Earth.\n \n If you go back to Neanderthal times even, in a small group of hunters & gatherers, if one family out of the bunch had a bumper crop and killed a mammoth and the others had none, I'm sure, for the survival of the group, the bounty was divided by a wise elder and shared among them all.\n \n If a group of slackers were constantly scavenging the goods of others or, committing other crimes against the community I'm sure they were run out of the camp at spear-point. emoticon_xkill\n \n This is what our government is supposed to be doing today, to a certain extent. Don't you agree?\n \n \nI do not believe it is, you have claimed that a vote magically dissolves a man's rights. I do not believe this is true.\n \n If 999,999 out of 1,000,000 vote that every person should be allowed to own a slave we should not allow slavery, slavery is wrong.\n\n Your ideology is admirable but the reality is you are wrong.\n A majority vote does dissolve a man's rights - as did the vote to eliminate slavery. Many slave-owners felt their rights were being dissolved. If not 999,999 out of 1,000,000 but 51% wanted to reinstate slavery, it would be so - even if the 49% think it is wrong.\n 'Slavery' is a subjective term anyway. Every 'employee' is a slave to their employer. The main difference between then and now are the laws that have raised the quality of treatment of workers and the illusion of 'freedom' they now have.\n \n \nAh yes, I have not connected with the vibes of the universe. I am an individual, one mind, one body. How small right?\n \n I do not want to be by myself.\n\n Yes, very small and very alone, indeed. We are not the majority.\n \n I learned something a few years ago about statistics and the population when I was doing fluoride research. I called it the 60/20/20 Theory:\n ... in any given situation, you will have 20% who are opposed, 20% who don't give a XXXX and 60% who will follow the popular propaganda.\n Guess who always wins in a Democracy - the gullible Lemmings who are the majority of the population. emoticon_mad\n The conclusion is: it's not the individual politicians who are to blame...it's the entire System that is flawed. He Who Has The Loudest Propaganda Wins.\n I suspect the Founding Fathers were aware of my 60/20/20 Theory right from the beginning. :xbanghead\n \n \n \nI have hypothesized a government model which is nearly impervious to corruption.\n\n Now THIS I want to see. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nYou should be careful what you say; I have posted this argument many times with no one able to disprove any of the premises.\n \n In fact if you do I will have to rethink many things and perhaps become an anarchist (emoticon_cry)\n \n I have established the proper epistemology for myself. So being wrong doesn't happen alot for me.\n \n If it has been shown that I am wrong I change my position, if I haven't then I have no reason to believe I am wrong.\n \n If you act so for long enough you will find you are right more and more often as well. \n\n As do most rational folks. Only an XXXXX would continue sticking his hand in the fire after being burned once.emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \nTo the argument? There are two possible outcomes, you win or I win.\n \n If my logic is faulty I lose, if yours is you lose.\n \n If I don't argue or use informal fallacies I lose, if you don't argue or use informal fallacies you lose. \n\n There is a third and fourth alternative: you are both wrong and you are both right. \n \n \nBecause reality does not change due to perception. \n\n Eh, you're wrong on this one. Too many examples to list...\n \n \nEveryone has the same rights.They are to be considered oppressed only if their rights are violated.\n\n \n Eh, wrong again. Broken down to the basics: Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness, you can not say that Everyone has the same rights. Not Everyone WANTS the same rights! \n \n \nIt is about my personal belief and how government affects me personally. You see I am an individual.\n \n\n As I said earlier, your philosophy on life can not work in the 'real world'. Sorry. emoticon_cry",

(Still arguing here for the sake of those still under oppression of course emoticon_xangel)\n \n \nIf you go back to Neanderthal times even, in a small group of hunters & gatherers, if one family out of the bunch had a bumper crop and killed a mammoth and the others had none, I'm sure, for the survival of the group, the bounty was divided by a wise elder and shared among them all.\n\n No doubt, that does not mean the bounty was the group's by right.\n \n \nIf a group of slackers were constantly scavenging the goods of others or, committing other crimes against the community I'm sure they were run out of the camp at spear-point. emoticon_xkill\n\n Crimes against the community or crimes against individuals? What is the difference in your mind?\n \nThis is what our government is supposed to be doing today\n\n Not my government, my government is supposed to be protecting individual rights without exception or compromise.\n \n to a certain extent. Don't you agree?\n\n No.\n \n If a man wishes to keep nothing he has produced for himself and help everyone he sees that is his prerogative.\n \n If a man wishes to keep everything he has produced and help no one that is his prerogative.\n \n If a man wishes to violate another's rights so he can have a luxury or avoid working for his living that is not his prerogative.\n \n If a man wishes to violate another's rights so he can help the poor and do good to all those he meets that is not his prerogative.\n \n The unifying theme of my morality is liberty regardless of all personal motives, including hoarding and altruism.\n \n \nYour ideology is admirable but the reality is you are wrong.\n\n One should not be able to say both in good conscious.\n \nA majority vote does dissolve a man's rights \n\n How?\n \n- as did the vote to eliminate slavery. Many slave-owners felt their rights were being dissolved.\n\n Men do not have the right to own each other, a vote to eliminate slavery could not take away a right that does not exist.\n \n There were those who thought their rights were being dissolved, they were wrong i.e. incorrect.\n \n \nIf not 999,999 out of 1,000,000 but 51% wanted to reinstate slavery, it would be so - even if the 49% think it is wrong.\n\n In a pure democracy, yes.\n \n That would mean slavery would be reinstantiated, which would mean rights could be legally violated.\n \n That cannot be true while those rights yet exist; if they exist they have not been dissolved.\n \n \n'Slavery' is a subjective term anyway.\n\n Subjective to the definition - a person who is the property of and wholly subject to another.\n \nEvery 'employee' is a slave to their employer.\n\n Only if you ignore the meaning of both those words.\n \nThe main difference between then and now are the laws that have raised the quality of treatment of workers and the illusion of 'freedom' they now have.\n\n That illusion is more lucid for them than most CEO's\n \n \nI learned something a few years ago about statistics and the population when I was doing fluoride research. I called it the 60/20/20 Theory:\n ... in any given situation, you will have 20% who are opposed, 20% who don't give a XXXX and 60% who will follow the popular propaganda.\n Guess who always wins in a Democracy - the gullible Lemmings who are the majority of the population. emoticon_mad\n\n The solution seems to be to reduce the number of gullible lemmings, that is not the best solution though....\n \nThe conclusion is: it's not the individual politicians who are to blame...\n\n I will blame them if they have done something wrong.\n \nit's the entire System that is flawed.\n\n It is\n \n \nNow THIS I want to see. emoticon_rolleyes\n\n I can describe it however the full constitution is not yet written well enough to the point that I would show people.\n \n \n \nThere is a third and fourth alternative: you are both wrong and you are both right. \n\n In other words that we have no idea what the other is saying.\n \n \nEh, you're wrong on this one. Too many examples to list...\n\n Just one would turn my world upside down.\n \nEh, wrong again. Broken down to the basics: Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness, you can not say that Everyone has the same rights.\n\n Everyone has the same rights.\n \n There I just said it so I can say it.\n \n That is the same failure in the English language which you are misunderstanding, when I say a right cannot be dissolved I do not mean no one's right's have ever been violated I mean there is no way anyone's rights should be violated and that they do not go away just because they aren't being protected.\n \n When you said I cannot say \"\" you did not mean that I physically could not say it but that I could not say it and be right.\n \n Not Everyone WANTS the same rights! \n\n Liberty is the only and primary right, and one must have liberty to want a right.\n \n So it is a self-closing concept, the term is tautologous, one cannot use his right to decide his own life to insist that his life doesn't belong to him.\n \nAs I said earlier, your philosophy on life can not work in the 'real world'. Sorry. emoticon_cry\n\n Are you sure you know what the real world is?",

   "Yes\n \n Yes\n\n \n How? What makes them moral and ethical? \n \n \nYou mean you don't make the decision twice, when performing an action you have never taken before you do consider the moral value, or you should.\n\n \n No, I mean some actions are neither moral or immoral, ethical or unethical, right or wrong. \n \n \nJust because it takes less than a second to see most actions cannot be wrong does not mean you ignore right and wrong.\n\n \n At roughly 5 years old when I began making first time decisions I assure you contemplating the morality of my actions was not a consideration.\n \n \nThat which is not right is wrong, that which is not right is wrong.\n\n \n Being left handed does not automatically make you right handed.\n \n \nRight is that which is not wrong, wrong is an attribute of actions which are taken due to thought in contradiction with rational knowledge i.e. reality.\n\n \n So as long as you don't know your actions are wrong they aren't?\n \n So right and wrong are defined by actions that either align with or are contrary to thought and rational knowledge. In other words learned behavior.\n \n \nA person can't be completely moral unless every action they take is moral, every action must be completely moral or immoral.\n\n \n What happens if they are not? Why must they?\n \n \nMorality is not a behavior it is a concept, being moral is a behavior.\n\n \n Well now that we are clear on that. \n \n \nBeing moral is accepting and acting in accordance to the right.\n\n \n So if taxes are right then you would be immoral?\n \n \nHe is a good gauge of the right wing of the country.\n\n \n I really fear that is true.\n \n \nHe is entertaining, he caters to the right, and he believes every word he says.\n\n \n I believe if a find a coin on the street and it is face down it will bring me bad luck or throwing away the fortune from the cookie is throwing away your fortune. The title of this thread is God, Santa Claus and The Easter Bunny. Why is belief now a factor in whether he is a credible source of reliable information?\n \n \nYou won't find a more reliable source for the conservative movement.\n \n\n \n Because Rush believes it to be true it therefore must be.\n \n \nYes, many very good examples of immorality.\n\n \n Can't have one without the other\n \n \nUltimately yes, for practical purposes you should examine a reason (which is not exactly the same as motivation) to see if it is sound, it may be that one's moral judgment is incorrect.\n\n \n I liken it to reason vs. excuse.\n \n \nIf you cannot name a meaningful difference then you must admit that as far as you know taxes could be theft.\n\n \n Anything could be anything. Even if I could not name a difference it would not for that reason conclude tax is theft.\n \n \nArgument by definition:\n \n steal - to take (the property of another or others without permission or right, esp. secretly or by force: A pickpocket stole his watch. \n\n \n The government is empowered with the right.\n \n \ntheft  - the act of stealing; the wrongful taking and carrying away of the personal goods or property of another; larceny.\n\n \n The government is empowered with the right. If it is discovered later that they were in error your property is returned along with compensation for the loss of it's use.\n \n \nTax - a sum of money demanded by a government for its support or for specific facilities or services, levied upon incomes, property, sales, etc.\n\n \n Much like you demand a paycheck from your employer. \n \n \nTheft is the taking without permission or right, or by force not the unlawful taking.\n\n \n Because the first 3 are acts that define the last, a concept. The right to overrides permission or force. A convicted murderer does not give permission to be incarcerated, but government has the right to do so. A potential witness does not want to appear in court, government has the right to force him to do so.\n \n The government has the right to tax an individual who is under the jurisdiction of the US. Having been empowered by the governed with this right, it is not theft or stealing, nor can it be considered illegal. It can not be logically considered immoral if the reasons that would make it so are not valid. \n \n \nTo tax is to demand regardless of consent (permission), and to be prepared to force to comply.\n \n Taxation is theft.\n\n \n Consent is inherent by your use of or potential use of services and/or facilities and your continued presence within the jurisdiction of the US. \n \n Before you even bring up you would rather pay as you use or similar objection that idea is neither cost effective or practical. When you go to Disneyland you no longer buy A,B,C,D and E tickets. You get 1 price for the whole thing, ride the same ride once or 20 times same price. This method provides a cheaper means of managing and distributing services, provides incentive for improvements and additional services making a better overall experience for seller and buyer.\n \n \n By accepting your citizenship, you have accepted the constitution. It is very simple you are not being forced to accept it, you are choosing to. You may back out at anytime without any prior notice.\n \n \nConformity to the rules of right conduct; moral or virtuous conduct.\n \n \n Who came up with the rules of right conduct? What are they? \n \n \nRight - in conformity with fact, reason, truth, or some standard or principle; correct:\n \n Wrong - not in accordance with what is morally right or good: a wrong deed. \n\n \n Whose standard? Whose reason?\n \n \nI am not perfectly knowledgeable, so I will consider the question to be \"why isn't a single morality universally accepted\"\n \n Irrationality, failure to pursue the truth without accepting compromise.\n\n \n What if you don't find the truth? Can't truth can be deceptive. What is true today may be a different truth tomorrow. Does one have to actually be rational or is belief that an action is rational sufficient? \n \n \nWrong for social purposes, which means for the purposes of anything I would be interested in arguing about; is that which contradicts the principle of volition.\n \n Volition is a principle which proceeds directly from man's nature; he has a mind and survives by thinking.\n \n He acts in accordance with his thought.\n \n Failure to recognize that volition (aka liberty, freedom) is good is failure to recognize man survives by reason.\n\n \n So A there are two standards social and ??? what you don't want to talk about. B you could sum up the above in two words learned behavior.\n \n \nNo one will or ever has had the right to impose any idea onto another for any reason, regardless of any excuse.\n\n \n You must be against education K-12, but people do have the right to impose their will on others under certain circumstances. The fire dept doesn't ask how much of your house should they try and save from fire. A judge doesn't get your consent to declare you guilty. \n \n \nThere exists no situation in which something is both necessary and immoral, I did not set this as a law or anything I just discovered it was the case in every moral analysis I have done since I fully formed my philosophy.\n\n \n We have said necessary in a vacuum, If anything was found to be both I would then declare that whatever something is \"necessary\" for should be discarded.\n \n \nROFL, unlike the real dictators of the past we give you the opportunity to leave oppression.\n \n No, this earth is not someone else's to withhold from me should I decline to submit to their irrationality.\n\n \n But neither is it yours to do and act as you please. \n \n \nI should not have to leave my home because a group of people with guns decided they had the right to make me go.\n\n \n I agree. The government is there to make sure they have a warrant first and that only they can do it. Well at least with the guns part.\n \n \nI do not consent to taxation; I do not consent to leave. By what right would you force me to do either?\n\n \n By what right do you believe you have a choice? Why do you believe you have the right to stay? By what right do you express your desire to not give consent to taxation? \n \n \nI have accepted no trade.\n\n \n Remember that when you get a glass of water from your cold refrigerator to post a message sent over the net via cable or phone line. These lines travel either above the roads or below often following sewer system grids.\n \n And yes you did and continue to do so until you renounce the agreement. \n \n \nAny man who cares to think about what he and every other human is.\n\n \n Not getting this.\n \n \nAny man with the courage to do so.\n \n Any man with the courage to do so.\n\n \n Not necessary\n \n \nI do not believe it is, you have claimed that a vote magically dissolves a man's rights. I do not believe this is true.\n\n \n Tell that to a death row convict. Slavery was voted legal before it was voted illegal. Your rights may be taken from you or you may forfeit them or you may voluntarily consent to them being restricted. Your right to believe they can't be taken away from you can't be taken though. \n \n The individual gives consent to be a member of a society. That person agrees to be bound by certain conditions and receive certain benefits. \n \n \nIf 999,999 out of 1,000,000 vote that every person should be allowed to own a slave we should not allow slavery, slavery is wrong.\n\n \n I agree, but not the point. \n \n \nThe question is how does a person go about obtaining protection from a government, the answer is to fund it.\n\n \n By donation? Do you just not like the word tax? I am willing to bet you have an answer for this.\n \n \n \nAh yes, I have not connected with the vibes of the universe. I am an individual, one mind, one body. How small right?\n\n \n So is everybody else. \n \n When you can only see as far as your own shadow then yes that is small.\n \n \nI do not want to be by myself.\n\n \n What are you willing to give not to be?\n \n \nI have hypothesized a government model which is nearly impervious to corruption.\n\n \n Why complain about the problem if you have a solution?\n \n \nThe solution to law making is not finding a totally unbiased person, they do not exist.\n\n \n Maybe taxation isn't theft, your just biased.\n \n \nYou should be careful what you say; I have posted this argument many times with no one able to disprove any of the premises.\n\n \n Maybe not me, but there is always someone better.\n \n \nIn fact if you do I will have to rethink many things and perhaps become an anarchist (emoticon_cry)\n\n \n That is an incentive.\n \n \nI have established the proper epistemology for myself. So being wrong doesn't happen alot for me.\n\n \n Bad sentence to have a misspelled word in. At least is wasn't never.\n \n \nIf it has been shown that I am wrong I change my position, if I haven't then I have no reason to believe I am wrong.\n\n \n Better attitude than most. emoticon_xgood\n \n \nBecause reality does not change due to perception.\n\n \n Only if expressed in specifics.\n \n \n \nEveryone has the same rights.\n\n \n From whom? Not the individual. The individual has his rights by agreement with society. \n \n \nThey are to be considered oppressed only if their rights are violated.\n\n \n Those rights must first be accepted and agreed to by the group as well as what constitutes a violation.\n \n Which is why the government has the rights it does and the individual has the rights they do.\n \n \nYou see I am an individual.\n\n \n But are you alone? Are you not a member of Society? \n Would you like to be? \n I should warn you, there is a cost.\n \n \nNot an ounce.\n\n \n Whatever let's you sleep at night. emoticon_xhoho",

If the logic is sound no genius could dislodge it.\n \n \n \nBad sentence to have a misspelled word in. At least is wasn't never.\n\n What are you talking about?\n \n \nFrom whom? Not the individual. The individual has his rights by agreement with society. \n\n He has his rights because of what he is, he will never hold them on loan from an abstraction or another person.\n \n \nThose rights must first be accepted and agreed to by the group as well as what constitutes a violation.\n\n They must be agreed upon, but the group does not create them rights and cannot change them.\n \nWhich is why the government has the rights it does and the individual has the rights they do.\n\n Two men have the same rights as one, 10,000 men have the same rights as 1, a government has the same rights as one.\n \n \nBut are you alone?\n\n No\n \n Are you not a member of Society? \n\n One is not a member of society, one is in a society. I exist in a society.\n \nWould you like to be? \n\n In one of your collectives? no. I prefer the society that I am in to contain the least amount of delusional people.\n \nI should warn you, there is a cost.\n\n I swear to you that I would rather die than pay for a club membership with my liberty... with my soul.",

   "Taxes are theft because they take something from someone without consent, permission or right. They are immoral because they violate an individual's rights.\n \n\n The problem I think has to do with the misunderstanding or failure to realize you have forfeited your rights. The government is acting to correct that violation. All your life you have used the property and services that belong to the government and the people who it represents, now claiming it is your right to do so at your discretion and without cost to you or at a cost you deem appropriate. \n \n You have repeatedly acknowledged you do not have nor wish to have any agreement permitting you the use of the property or services. You have not been given consent to use the property or services. You do not have the right to violate the rights of the government or those who are represented by the government and are the owners of the property and providers of the services. You do not have the right to determine what is the appropriate amount that may be charged for the use of the property and services. The inability to come to a satisfactory arrangement does not give you the right to use the property and services until and if an agreement is reached.\n \n Thus government is not violating your rights, because government is protecting it's rights which you have violated and my rights which you have violated and the rights of every other person who has deemed it rational to pool their resources to the benefit of all. You who do not wish to participate, have the right to not be compelled to do so, but that does not give you the right to take the property or use the services because of an accident of birth under conditions that you decide are sufficient. \n \n Below are statements supporting the above.\n \n \nTwo men have the same rights as one, 10,000 men have the same rights as 1, a government has the same rights as one.\n \n When your rights are taken it is called a violation of your rights.\n You may forfeit them by violating an others rights.\n \n Everyone has the same rights.\n \n They are to be considered oppressed only if their rights are violated.\n \n Not my government, my government is supposed to be protecting individual rights without exception or compromise.\n If a man wishes to keep nothing he has produced for himself and help everyone he sees that is his prerogative.\n If a man wishes to keep everything he has produced and help no one that is his prerogative.\n If a man wishes to violate another's rights so he can have a luxury or avoid working for his living that is not his prerogative.\n If a man wishes to violate another's rights so he can help the poor and do good to all those he meets that is not his prerogative.\n The unifying theme of my morality is liberty regardless of all personal motives, including hoarding and altruism.\n \n steal - to take (the property of another or others without permission or right, esp. secretly or by force: A pickpocket stole his watch.\n theft - the act of stealing; the wrongful taking and carrying away of the personal goods or property of another; larceny.\n Tax - a sum of money demanded by a government for its support or for specific facilities or services, levied upon incomes, property, sales, etc.\n Theft is the taking without permission or right, or by force not the unlawful taking.\n To tax is to demand regardless of consent (permission), and to be prepared to force to comply\n",

   "One example: The government has the right to confiscate your pot patch. You may believe you have the right to grow it for your personal use or, sell it for income but, society has decided that it should be illegal and so, your right to grow it has been dissolved.\n\n That is an invalid argument, if that was the reason pot was illegal, I would say it should not be.\n \nDo you live in the US?

You may feel you have the right to have an abortion.

Compromises must be made for the relationship to work and be beneficial to all.\n\n No compromise in morality, never.\n \n \nIf this is true, then why would your version be any better than what we have now - which appears to be worthless to you?\n\n Because a rational person would believe government should be based on individual rights, believe they are absolute, and believe they exist objectively and rationality is superior to irrationality.\n \n There are some who would argue our current government was based on human rights.\n \nSo, if you are the ruler of your government, anyone who did not believe in your government would be...what?...executed, asked to leave, put in prison?

His organization intentionally spread every collectivist fallacy \n ever invented for the sole purpose his patently evil goals.\n \n There is only one thing I don't hate about him, his extremism. Likewise those irrational collectivist who analyze him will do anything to avoid asking questions like \"why did the German people go along with it\" and instead condemn him for being extreme.\n \n The pattern continues to this day, if some one is extreme they must be bad. Being wrong about ethics is OK but not being extreme about it.\n \n This is a known fallacy called fallacy of the middle, it is the specific application of the notion that the correct view lies in a compromise between two opposing positions.\n \n Uncompromising loyalty to what you believe to be true is a virtue, it's called integrity.\n \n Do not say that those evil people with integrity but no rational thought are evil because they have integrity, they are evil because they have no rational thought.\n \n A man can be compassionate and evil, brave and evil, rational and evil.\n \n Only when all virtues are practiced is it impossible to be evil.\n \n So I sound like the uni-bomber to you?

I don't think so.\n\n They do, they just aren't honest enough to admit it to themselves.\n \n The very act of \"wanting\" something takes for premises that they are an individual who can want something individually, that they have a will with which to want something, and that they have the right to voice and gratify that will.\n \n A man who says \"I don't want the right to liberty\" is saying:\n \"I have a personal desire to not have the right to have personal desires\"\n \n An oxymoron...\n \nWhat happened to 'Freedom'?\n Did Pappillion and I find a chink in his armor - did we turn his world up-side-down? :p\n\n You did not, I was merely living away from my computer for a time.\n \n\n The problem I think has to do with the misunderstanding or failure to realize you have forfeited your rights.\n\n Most true, I do not see it as a problem though :)\n \nThe government is acting to correct that violation.\n\n The violation of my life emoticon_wow\n \nAll your life you have used the property and services that belong to the government and the people who it represents, now claiming it is your right to do so at your discretion and without cost to you or at a cost you deem appropriate. \n\n The government owns nothing it has stolen and it is not my fault that constructs are created and declared public.\n \n \nYou have repeatedly acknowledged you do not have nor wish to have any agreement permitting you the use of the property or services.\n\n I never said I did not wish to have.\n \nYou have not been given consent to use the property or services.\n\n Then why are they called public?\n \nYou do not have the right to violate the rights of the government or those who are represented by the government and are the owners of the property and providers of the services. \n\n and so I have not.\n \nYou do not have the right to determine what is the appropriate amount that may be charged for the use of the property and services.\n\n For me I do.\n \nThe inability to come to a satisfactory arrangement does not give you the right to use the property and services until and if an agreement is reached.\n\n That is true.\n \nThus government is not violating your rights, because government is protecting it&#8217;s rights which you have violated and my rights which you have violated and the rights of every other person who has deemed it rational to pool their resources to the benefit of all.\n\n You are talking about a proper government which we do not have.\n \n I cannot violate rights by accepting something that is given to me, a government cannot have the right to steal then justify it's theft by providing services.\n \n There is a perfect analogy to this:\n When some one spits on your windshield and starts to clean it without asking you then looks to you for money do you owe it to him?\n \n By your logic you do because you used his service (never mind that you didn't ask for it right?).\n \n I say no you don't, if no agreement was made it is as good as charity.\n \nYou who do not wish to participate, have the right to not be compelled to do so, but that does not give you the right to take the property or use the services because of an accident of birth under conditions that you decide are sufficient. \n\n I like you very much :)\n \n Now consider this, I have always been willing to pay for what I use, I have paid over 100% more than what I owe.\n \n You have made an elegant argument and you have made it on correct axioms, merely containing two incorrect premises: \n [*]You assume that I have ever been given a choice to pay for any service provided to the public.\n [*]You assume that the government can speak for everyone else besides me.\n The government does not offer the roads (that and police protection are about the only services I actually use) for a certain payment, they provide the roads to the public for free.

That is true.\n \n I say if I do not want roads I should not have to pay for them.\n \n So long as a government violates rights I will not consider it an entity deserving of rights.\n \n You say it's a package deal, on the premise that the whole of the country has made this decision.\n \n If 51% of people say all or nothing no one will have a right to tell me I cannot live with the other 49% on my own terms.\n \n If the whole of the country will not build roads I will find friends and neighbors and other people in my city and I will suggest we pool our resources and build them ourselves.\n \n Morality cannot proceed from immorality so you cannot say one must not take from a thief what is yours because he has left you something you wanted.\n \n The roads belong to me now just as much as they do to anyone else, what if I pay more taxes then you? what if I pay your taxes too? then can I say you have no rights to the roads?\n \n No of course not, the government has chosen to disassociate taxes with services and I will not reverse that judgement.\n \n If the government collapsed today to whom would the roads belong? I don't think you would be in favour of granting shares according to those who paid that highest taxes and neither would I because taxes don't buy you roads they buy you time in which you can live without being arrested.\n \n What if my moral government existed?

That is a possible definition, but not the one the government uses when declaring something public.\n \n \nI never said I did not wish to have.\n\n \n Correct, you never used the word wish. You did make it clear you had no desire, but it doesn't have any effect on that you do not.\n \n \nThen why are they called public?\n \n\n \n Because they are for the public's benefit. Which doesn't mean anybody and/or everybody.\n \n \nand so I have not.\n\n \n Under your premise you have and you have transgressed your own philosophy, the foundation of your argument.\n \n \nFor me I do.\n\n \n Only if it belongs to you, otherwise you don't. The owner may sell, lease, rent or trade for whatever value he desires. The buyer user can choose to accept that or not. The buyer user doesn't determine what the owner will accept. \n \n That is true.\n \n \nYou are talking about a proper government which we do not have.\n\n \n Irrelevant. \n \n \nI cannot violate rights by accepting something that is given to me,\n \n \n Of course you can. You have deceived government. \n \n \na government cannot have the right to steal then justify it's theft by providing services.\n\n \n Nobody has the right to steal. \n \n \nThere is a perfect analogy to this:\n When some one spits on your windshield and starts to clean it without asking you then looks to you for money do you owe it to him?\n \n By your logic you do because you used his service (never mind that you didn't ask for it right?).\n \n I say no you don't, if no agreement was made it is as good as charity.\n\n \n Your right this is a good analogy of what is wrong with your premise. \n \n You leave out one important factor. He told you he was going to do it before he did and you stopped in front of a sign that said stop here for window cleaning. Had you said something to discourage him or continued on your way that would be different. Allowing him to think you want him to is not the same as unsolicited.\n \n I like you very much :)\n \n Now consider this, I have always been willing to pay for what I use, I have paid over 100% more than what I owe.\n \n You have made an elegant argument and you have made it on correct axioms, merely containing two incorrect premises: \n [LIST=1]\n \n[*]You assume that I have ever been given a choice to pay for any service provided to the public.\n\n \n You have it's the rate the public is taxed. \n \n \n[*]You assume that the government can speak for everyone else besides me.\n\n \n It can and until you tell it otherwise it can for you also. \n \n \nThe government does not offer the roads (that and police protection are about the only services I actually use)\n \n \n Every use a toilet, electricity, telephone? How often do you wonder about the standards your house is built to? If the doctor you see is qualified? If the food you eat is safe. If it is bad where does it go? If those things aren't safe at least there is a fast way to get you help. Maybe at a time when age makes things much more difficult. That when you come home you can be reasonably sure your home will not have strangers living in it and if they are you have a means to evict them. How was private K-12 and college? As good for you as it was for your parents? \n \n \nfor a certain payment, they provide the roads to the public for free. The public it is said is any citizen.\n\n \n If they did nobody would get taxed. A US citizen is anyone under the jurisdiction of the United States Government.\n \n \nThey have deemed me a citizen.\n\n \n You have not told them you are not. You have done nothing that would give them reason not to.\n \n \nThey have provided for me all privileges and services they deem due to a citizen.\n\n \n So deception is a valid way to violate rights? Because a mistake is made there is no recourse and it may never be corrected? \n \n \nThen they demand money from me, an amount I am not to decide, for what purpose I am not to decide.\n\n \n You sound surprised, yet you know the government taxes it's citizens. You also know The Us has a representive form of Government. Yet you stay and say nothing as to your desire to not be bound by governments laws. At least the ones you don't feel are fair. \n \n \nIf the government behaved as you described it then no one who doesn't pay taxes would get to use the roads,\n \n \n No I described a government fulfilling it's obligations, protecting the interests of it citizens and enforcing the rights of both.\n \n \nI hope you know there are people who don't pay taxes.\n\n \n Minors typically don't. The older ones are subject to the coercive power of government.\n \n \nYou describe it as a business contract as it should be but that would require that the seller could not force money out of it's buyers, nor force it's buyers to leave their homes.\n\n \n It would also compel the user to pay for the use once it was made aware there were costs associated with use. Maybe if you were not aware you could argue that, but once you know and continue to use your liable.\n \n \nAll you have said is that if I do not want to pay for roads I should not get them. That is true.\n\n \n Now apply that to everything, not just roads.\n \n \nI say if I do not want roads I should not have to pay for them.\n\n \n If it only it was just roads things may be so much simpler. You don't have to, but you have to tell the government.\n \n \nSo long as a government violates rights I will not consider it an entity deserving of rights.\n\n \n Do others get to decide who is worthy of certain rights or just you? I thought your philosophy was somewhat different.\n \n \nYou say it's a package deal, on the premise that the whole of the country has made this decision.\n\n \n They have decided to be bound by the decisions that the people who they choose to make these decisions have decided.\n \n \nIf 51% of people say all or nothing no one will have a right to tell me I cannot live with the other 49% on my own terms.\n\n \n Except that 49%. Now what?\n \n \nIf the whole of the country will not build roads I will find friends and neighbors and other people in my city and I will suggest we pool our resources and build them ourselves.\n\n \n You mean like the colonists? Who will mange the construction and costs? What if nobody wants to build as wide, or long, or people don't want a road thru there yard? How will you maintain it? What about people who don't help, but then use it?\n \n \nMorality cannot proceed from immorality so you cannot say one must not take from a thief what is yours because he has left you something you wanted.\n\n \n What you mean is it is not immoral to recover what was taken from you from the one who took it or has it. It is still immoral to rob a thief.\n \n \nThe roads belong to me now just as much as they do to anyone else,\n \n \n The roads belong to the government. The public is permitted use and you have to be a member of the public, again it is not everybody and/or anybody.\n \n \nwhat if I pay more taxes then you? \n\n \n Get a better CPA\n \n \nwhat if I pay your taxes too? \n\n \n Thank you, you would be a nice person.\n \n \nthen can I say you have no rights to the roads?\n\n \n No, because you don't own them. If you built a road on your property that connected two places then you could do all of those things and more if you wanted. Even charge a toll for your road.\n \n \n \nNo of course not, the government has chosen to disassociate taxes with services and\n \n \n No government has chosen not to give every person a line item bill.\n \n \nI will not reverse that judgement.\n\n \n I was worried you might.\n \n \nIf the government collapsed today to whom would the roads belong?\n\n \n The successors to the government.\n \n \nI don't think you would be in favour of granting shares according to those who paid that highest taxes \n\n \n Probably not.\n \n \nand neither would I because taxes don't buy you roads they buy you time in which you can live without being arrested.\n \n\n \n They pay for roads, but yes they don't buy you a road. This is like saying killing people doesn't keep them alive it just keeps you out of jail.\n \n \n \nWhat if my moral government existed? What if each man could only speak for himself and cooperation only happened when volunteers made it happen?\n\n \n Complete chaos. What if there was no cooperation? What if there wasn't enough volunteers? Why volunteer when other people will, maybe, and then you can just use it for free?\n \n \n \nCould a large group of people build a road system? Yes. Could they say that you need to pay for it or you won't get it? Yes. Could they say that you must pay for it because we are going to make it public? No.\n\n \n Something becoming public is not why you pay taxes.\n \n \nIt's your choice what way to look it at, either the roads are private and I need only pay for roads,\n \n \n Why would you determine what the price would be? Do I tell you what you will sell your property for? \n \n \nor they are public and I am being forced to pay for whatever the government wants, that the roads just happen to be one of the things I use.\n\n \n They are public, but public doesn't mean anybody and/or everybody. You are not being forced to do anything. You have a choice, you just don't like the choice. That is different than not having one. \n \n \n \nYou know the latter is true.\n\n \n No I don't and deep down you know it isn't as well. What this all boils down to is you just don't like a couple of specific actions that government performs. \n \n Your descriptions of the things you would do are what government has done in the past. Government tried it your way and it failed. Our government is the second attempt at self rule after the revolution. \n \n Even as this exchange has progressed you have gone from staunch supporter of rights under any circumstances to deciding that government does not deserve its rights and that you will not respect its rights because you disagree with its actions. Both ideas contrary to your stated philosophy.\n \n The question you really need to ask before saying taxes are theft is does government have the authority to compel people under it's jurisdiction to conform to the laws of the public. Do you have a claim free of any claim of any other to your property. If government has this authority it cannot be theft when it acts according to the rules set forth describing its abilities. If your property is burdened with partial claims in interest then stealing is a marginal claim at best\n \n Government did not invade from outer space. It was born of the free will of individuals who granted it its authority. It's unfortunate you were born to late to participate in it's creation, but that is not something to fault government for. Government despite this is still obligated to allow you to change it if enough of the governed agree to do so. \n \n Government was granted it's authority to protect the interests of the people it governs. You may not like the way it does it, but that is not relevent to whether it can perform certain actions or not. You are not forced to participate in society. You may choose not to accept governments conditions, but you do not get the benefits without the responsibility.

   "That is one way to look at it.\n\n Apparently the way you look it at.\n \n \nI agree. Nobody owns anything that isn't theirs\n\n So the government owns nothing.\n \n \n \nI am glad you agree. You have used the word public incorrectly. That is a possible definition, but not the one the government uses when declaring something public.\n \n Because they are for the public's benefit. Which doesn't mean anybody and/or everybody.\n\n The public being any citizen.\n \n \nCorrect, you never used the word wish. You did make it clear you had no desire, but it doesn't have any effect on that you do not.\n\n I did not make it clear I had not desire.\n \n \nUnder your premise you have and you have transgressed your own philosophy, the foundation of your argument.\n\n That is a lie.\n \n \n \nOnly if it belongs to you, otherwise you don't. The owner may sell, lease, rent or trade for whatever value he desires. The buyer user can choose to accept that or not. The buyer user doesn't determine what the owner will accept. \n\n The buyer determines what he will accept.\n \n \n \nIrrelevant. \n\n The status of stolen property has everything to do with whether the entity currently possessing it owns it.\n \n \nOf course you can. You have deceived government. \n\n What have I said to deceive the government?\n \n \n \nNobody has the right to steal. \n\n Nobody\n \n \n \nYour right this is a good analogy of what is wrong with your premise. \n\n Nothing is wrong with my premise.\n \nYou leave out one important factor. He told you he was going to do it before he did and you stopped in front of a sign that said stop here for window cleaning. \n\n If him telling you is analogous to an IRS audit, and the stop sign is analogous to the notion that the government owns the country then I will refine my analogy to include the fact that when he told you he was going to do it he said \"the people of this street have elected me to wash windows, I will now wash your window and as a member of the society of this street you must pay to me $350\" and he didn't own the road.\n \n \nHad you said something to discourage him or continued on your way that would be different. Allowing him to think you want him to is not the same as unsolicited.\n\n I am telling you now that I will not and have not agreed to any payment for any services excepting only explicit communication.\n \n There now I have told you, you want to stop giving me free stuff stop paying taxes.\n \n Wait, you can't you don't have the right to choose what your money pays for you surrendered that to the collective.\n \n \n\n You have it's the rate the public is taxed. \n\n Prove this statement.\n \n \n \nIt can and until you tell it otherwise it can for you also. \n\n It cannot anymore than Hitler could speak for the Aryans of the world.\n \n \n \nEvery use a toilet, electricity, telephone? How often do you wonder about the standards your house is built to? If the doctor you see is qualified? If the food you eat is safe. If it is bad where does it go? If those things aren't safe at least there is a fast way to get you help. Maybe at a time when age makes things much more difficult. That when you come home you can be reasonably sure your home will not have strangers living in it and if they are you have a means to evict them. How was private K-12 and college? As good for you as it was for your parents? \n\n Many of the items you mentioned are provided via a company, the others are helpful but unnecessary. All of them are irrelevant in specifics to this argument.\n \n \nIf they did nobody would get taxed. A US citizen is anyone under the jurisdiction of the United States Government.\n\n Then explain why roads are provided to people who don't pay taxes.\n \n \nYou have not told them you are not. You have done nothing that would give them reason not to.\n\n Did you know you are part of my own private country called enslave pappillionia? You never gave me any reason to believe you weren't emoticon_xgood\n \n \nSo deception is a valid way to violate rights? Because a mistake is made there is no recourse and it may never be corrected? \n\n Explain\n \n \nYou sound surprised\n\n I am not.\n \nyet you know the government taxes it's citizens.\n\n I do\n \nYou also know The Us has a representive form of Government.\n\n I do\n \nYet you stay and say nothing as to your desire to not be bound by governments laws. At least the ones you don't feel are fair. \n\n I am telling you now, and I have told others before.\n \n \nNo I described a government fulfilling it's obligations, protecting the interests of it citizens and enforcing the rights of both.\n\n Protecting rights by violating them?\n \nMinors typically don't. The older ones are subject to the coercive power of government.\n\n No one is ethically subject to coercive power.\n \n \n \nIt would also compel the user to pay for the use once it was made aware there were costs associated with use.\n\n Yes\n \nMaybe if you were not aware you could argue that, but once you know and continue to use your liable.\n\n Or I could argue that since I no one owns the roads anymore than I do I have just as much right them.\n \n You may build a road system with whom ever you please and charge whatever you please, in fact you can personally exempt me from ever using it.\n \n You can make it a package deal, you can do what ever you want! Trust me I won't be using your roads if I haven't paid for them.\n \n \n \nNow apply that to everything, not just roads.\n\n Done\n \n \nIf it only it was just roads things may be so much simpler. You don't have to, but you have to tell the government.\n\n I don't like prison.\n \n \nDo others get to decide who is worthy of certain rights or just you? \n\n Everyone has the same rights and they are known by rational inquiry into the field of ethics.\n \nI thought your philosophy was somewhat different.\n\n You understood it well enough to attack me with it, it would probably have worked on someone who has not thought about this as much as I.\n \n \n \nThey have decided to be bound by the decisions that the people who they choose to make these decisions have decided.\n\n Everyone except me?\n \n \nExcept that 49%. Now what?\n\n I am lonely, out of meaningful work and living like Robinson Crusoe.\n \n \nYou mean like the colonists?\n\n How flattering\n \nWho will mange the construction and costs?\n\n If no qualified person besides me wishes to do it I would.\n \nWhat if nobody wants to build as wide, or long,\n\n Then they will not build as wide or long, as opposed to some tyrannical body forcing them to despite their belief.\n \n or people don't want a road thru there yard?\n\n Well obviously we would just have to violate their rights because there are more of us and we have guns :xbanghead\n \n How will you maintain it?\n\n By performing the actions which maintain roads.\n \n What about people who don't help, but then use it?\n\n Personally I would be in favor of either a public or private road network, it would depend on what people want.\n \n \n \nWhat you mean is it is not immoral to recover what was taken from you from the one who took it or has it. It is still immoral to rob a thief.\n\n yes\n \n \nThe roads belong to the government.\n\n They do not except by virtue of the force they will bring to bear on anyone who does not agree they do.\n \n \nGet a better CPA\n\n Or make less money....\n \n \nNo, because you don't own them. If you built a road on your property that connected two places then you could do all of those things and more if you wanted. Even charge a toll for your road.\n\n emoticon_xagree\n \n \nNo government has chosen not to give every person a line item bill.\n\n Yet items appear on the line when services are not used, that window washer is starting to sound like \"Alright this is what you got to pay no matter what, and you can use any of the things you are paying for\"\n \n \nI was worried you might.\n\n Worry no longer.\n \nThe successors to the government.\n\n The people, not the collective fallacy the actual abstraction, meaning everyone and anyone.\n \n \n \nThey pay for roads, but yes they don't buy you a road. This is like saying killing people doesn't keep them alive it just keeps you out of jail.\n\n Except one is immoral.\n \n It is also like saying paying protection money doesn't protect you, it just keeps the mafia from killing you.\n \n \n \nComplete chaos.\n\n Then we deserve complete chaos.\n \nWhat if there was no cooperation?\n\n Then there would be no cooperation.\n \n I ask you what if there is no cooperation?\n \n Shall people be \"made to cooperate\"?\n \n \n What if there wasn't enough volunteers?\n\n You didn't say volunteers for what but it doesn't matter, the answer is that there wouldn't be enough volunteers.\n \n\n Why volunteer when other people will, maybe, and then you can just use it for free?\n\n Perhaps you are a man of integrity.\n \n \nSomething becoming public is not why you pay taxes.\n\n I pay taxes because I cannot defend myself from the forces of the united states.\n \n \n \nWhy would you determine what the price would be?\n\n I would not, but since the government is as much mine as anyone elses I would demand my share of any profit, the end result being that the price is what it costs without markup.\n \n \nThey are public, but public doesn't mean anybody and/or everybody. \n\n It means US citizens, I have been declared a US citizen.\n \nYou are not being forced to do anything.\n\n Prove it.\n \n You have a choice, you just don't like the choice. That is different than not having one. \n\n The Jews at auschwitz had a choice to stay and die in a gas chamber or die by a bullet while attempting to escape, they just didn't like the choice.\n \n \nNo I don't and deep down you know it isn't as well.\n\n I know it is true, if that was not the premise then the necessity of the alternative would be that I do not pay for what I do not want to. You have admitted many times that you believe it is a package deal.\n \n \nWhat this all boils down to is you just don't like a couple of specific actions that government performs. \n\n Yea, every action that violates anyone's rights in theory or practice.\n \n \nYour descriptions of the things you would do are what government has done in the past.\n\n Governments have built roads, no government has been completly moral.\n \nGovernment tried it your way and it failed.\n\n Prove it. (going to be hard you don't even know what \"my way\" is fully)\n \n \nEven as this exchange has progressed you have gone from staunch supporter of rights under any circumstances to deciding that government does not deserve its rights and that you will not respect its rights because you disagree with its actions.\n\n I have no changed my position in the least, a thief does not have property rights over his loot, a murderer does not have the right to liberty.\n \n \nThe question you really need to ask before saying taxes are theft is does government have the authority to compel people under it's jurisdiction to conform to the laws of the public.\n\n Good question, no it does not.\n \nDo you have a claim free of any claim of any other to your property.\n\n What?\n \nIf government has this authority it cannot be theft when it acts according to the rules set forth describing its abilities.\n\n Quite right.\n \nIf your property is burdened with partial claims in interest then stealing is a marginal claim at best\n\n What?\n \n \nGovernment did not invade from outer space.\n\n Are space aliens the only beings who violate rights?\n \nIt was born of the free will of individuals who granted it its authority.\n\n You cannot grant authority you yourself do not possess.\n \nIt's unfortunate you were born to late to participate in it's creation, but that is not something to fault government for.\n\n Perhaps it's not to late to participate in the creation of a government for both of us.\n \nGovernment despite this is still obligated to allow you to change it if enough of the governed agree to do so. \n\n Which has what to do with my arguments?\n \n \nGovernment was granted it's authority to protect the interests of the people it governs.\n\n Under the full force of every authority any of it's members posses.\n \n \nYou may not like the way it does it, but that is not relevent to whether it can perform certain actions or not.\n\n You are correct.\n \nYou are not forced to participate in society.\n\n I am.\n \nYou may choose not to accept governments conditions, but you do not get the benefits without the responsibility.\n\n This government is what I do not accept, not all governments.\n \n \nYou argue the government has no right to take what is yours without your consent, but you will take from the government\n\n Since the government has stolen from me I cannot be stealing by taking back what was taken.\n \nand feel you have done nothing wrong. \n\n I will continue to think that until what I recover from the government exceeds what they have taken from me.\n \n \n \nThat to settle your conscience you will dictate terms and conditions that satisfy you without regard to whether the government agrees.\n\n My conscience is settled.\n \n \n \nNo I just need to show that Government has the authority to act or that government has a valid claim of interest in your property or that you are obligated to perform specific actions in return for specific actions of performed by government.\n \n Any of those would be sufficient.\n \nIf certain rights are a part of what man is then he will act to protect those rights to the best of his ability.\n\n and most men do, the problem is men do not want to respect the rights of others so they refuse to accept them in themselves. They then feel guilty for what they feel is greed or selfishness when it is simply their own desire to be free.\n \n \nMan understands this is accomplished by creating order.

I would love to develop it with everyone on these forums.\n \n It would contain three sections,[*]Moral structure[*]Division of power & government procedure[*]Signers\n Moral structure would do what our constitution didn't try to, it will spell out exactly what moral framework in explicit scientific language the government will be founded on.\n \n It's core will be the enumeration of individual rights in derivative form, that is that they are presented in a structure which derives all rights from parent rights with the right to one's self as the root.\n \n It would also contain the provision for various crises that have or could happen.\n \n Divisions of power & Government procedure would accomplish the same function that our current constitution does. It would specify the branches of government, all their rights and functions.\n \n This part really requires specifics but to boil it down what congress does now has been off loaded to pure democracy, the executive branch has been detached from the military and has no president.\n \n A distinction is made between government action (amoral) and law (only moral).\n \n The fundamental difference between legislating in this government and ours is that it will be specifically declared that no law or government action may contradict the moral structure, may not violate rights.\n \n The idea of democracy was that corruption is limited by moving power to the people at large, but the horror of mob rule was untenable.

The last attempt was a horrible name.\n \n \nI will continue to think that until what I recover from the government exceeds what they have taken from me.\n \n\n \n Blame your parents for birthing you into indentured servitude. \n \n \nand most men do, the problem is men do not want to respect the rights of others so they refuse to accept them in themselves. They then feel guilty for what they feel is greed or selfishness when it is simply their own desire to be free.\n\n \n One day maybe, not in my life time.\n \n \nI know the oxymoron of protection/violation is something you believe, what I have not heard is a justification for this absurd belief.\n\n \n Because man is flawed. We don't fear an uprising of chickens or other barnyard animals violating our rights, we fear man will, because given the opportunity he has proven his inability to exist in harmony with his own species.\n \n \nNo rights should be \"subject\" to the law but the goal of the law. A man may never forfeit his rights except by crime, if a man commits a crime has has already disagreed to law making this non-existent consent interaction meaningless.\n\n \n The goal of law is stability and order and the protection of rights. If you are not subject to the law you become part of the disorder and instability that violates rights. Without consent every man will have his own law. Are you really ready to try the honor system with society?\n \n \nI announce I do not accept the laws.\n\n \n Then participate in government and ....oh never mind. \n Why?\n \n \nI do not care for what the current government finds neccesary.\n\n \n Seems you and government agree on at least some things.\n \n \nI think he could use your help again.\n\n \n Your confidence is inspiring. \n \n \n You say that government is guilty of theft because it imposes taxes on its citizens and uses the threat of seizure to demand a percentage of your property. You showed the definition of theft as something being taken without consent, permission, or right. Further stating you never agreed to obligate yourself nor does any person have the right to obligate you to government taxation. \n In order for a theft to occur there must be law. Law establishes ownership and what constitutes a violation of ownership, it is the means by which individuals create and maintain stability and order within their collective existence. It benefits the individual and the state, but law is by consensus. The collective agrees what will be the laws, what will be the punishments, what is permitted to enforce the laws, and what is necessary to maintain the law. They agree to relinquish certain rights under certain circumstances, which permits law to function effectively. \n Your position is that government has not the authority, nor can government be given the authority to compel your performance under conditions that it dictates. Your defense though is to switch positions with government. Now you are mandating that government must perform under conditions that you dictate. Just as you believe, you have no power to make government cease what you deem a violation of your rights you would remove government's power to act against an individual. You cannot say it is unfair simply because you want to be the one you deem is favored. It is either unfair or it is not.\n Government was granted it's authority through individuals. These individuals have rights as you do. They have a right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Under the rule of law, they established government to protect, enforce, and maintain those rights. Your desire to not be subject to the law is your right that government respects. The conditions and obligations of citizenship may be renounced and you may do so at anytime. You have no right to the protections and benefits offered by society if you choose not to abide by their laws. Your right to do as you please is not superior to my right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Your actions in withholding the resources necessary for government to protect the rights of society, while utilizing the resources of society is a violation of the individual and collective rights of every member of that society. By violating the rights of others, as you have acknowledged, you forfeit your rights.",

   "Now properly define citizen and we are making progress\n\n a native or naturalized member of a state or nation who owes allegiance to its government and is entitled to its protection (distinguished from alien). \n \nYes you did.\n\n Show me.\n \nUse by deceit is theft. \n\n Answer my charge.\n \nThe seller/owner determines the availability/price. The buyers choice on what he will accept is meaningless if there is nothing for his use or purchase\n\n Yes\n \nI agree. This was in response to your comment concerning the performance of government. Your opinion as to whether government is doing a good job isn't relevant.\n\n I didn't make a comment such as that and expect it to be relevant.\n \n A proper government would be one which does not steal property.\n \n \nYou don't want to be a citizen.\n\n Not under the terms that it would be offered me, however; I have not been offered any terms, I stopped saying the pledge of alliegance the moment I knew what it meant. I comply with government regulations and follow it's laws. I respond to the census and vote for it's leaders.\n \n but I promise you if I was ever given a document to sign with the terms of citizen ship as they are forced upon the the people of this country, if I had to submit to any decision that congress, the president, the courts may make as price for this citizenship I would not sign it and I would bear any consequence for I would know that I had no choice.\n \n \nBeing a citizen under terms you determine and that are contrary to those established is the same thing as not not wanting to be. \n\n That is more or less true.\n \n Now, answer the question; what have I said to deceive the government?\n \n \nExcept that from what little you have provided it wouldn't work. Maybe with more details that will change.\n\n It is an error to dismiss knowledge on the rationale that it does not integrate with your beliefs.\n \n When confronted with this situation what you should be doing is examining the support for both pieces of contradictory knowledge.\n \n If you think that uncompromising morality is an error because it won't work you should be examining why it would not work.\n \n Further practicality is not primary to morality, that is a lesson that history has taught us with many examples.\n \n \n \nI suppose this shouldn't be considered your desire to not be included in that collective under it's terms and conditions.\n\n It should be considered just that.\n \n \n Sorry I am to lazy right now to go and look at what it is in response to. I'll take it back until I figure it out.\n \nYou assume that I have ever been given a choice to pay for any service provided to the public. \n\n \n You have it's the rate the public is taxed. \n\n Prove I have been given a choice, to the best of my knowledge there is no program or provision for those who wish to pay for roads, police, military, ect but not taxes.\n \nSeems comparable emoticon_xdonno\n\n I love nazi/soviet/roman comparisons, I don't agree with this taboo against such comparisons they are very helpful.\n \n By taking a known evil and examining it's specific one can deduce evils relationship with the subject material.\n \n In other words if the analogy is sound it's the easiest way to arrive at such knowledge, if the analogy can be shown to be unsound it is again very telling.\n \n \nNow some are as a result of government, which are unnecessary? Certification Boards, education, court system, utilities? Personally I have no desire to have a real life dark ages experience and will disagree .\n\n The only things I find absolutely necessary are life, rational thought, and rights, otherwise I would submit to this pseudo-slavery for I risk many such things by choosing to believe the truth.\n \n \nBecause nobody wants to have to prove they are eligible every time they brush their teeth, use the toilet, drive to work or call mom to say hi. It is far more cost effective to go buffet style than order from the menu.\n\n So people who don't deserve to use the roads get to because it would be too much trouble to stop them?\n \n \nNow that I know I can, but maybe I won't, since in your country you can't do anything other than tell me I am not behaving, while I am free to run wild. emoticon_xgood \n\n but were you a citizen by default or did you have to agree to it? you see there is a little law in this country where everyone gives everything to me, since you have been a citizen all your life you need to give everything you have to me. emoticon_smile\n \n \nAgain this should not be considered a desire to not be part of society?\n\n It should not, and I pity the man who would stay silent about unfair laws because he believed society must be unfair.\n \n \n \nRights are applied equally but themselves are not necessarily equal in order\n\n Rights do not contradict each other so no order of importance need be decided upon.\n \n Just like your view of government the mere fact of contradicting rights would prove total morality impossible, all human life would be a compromise between good and evil.\n \n \n \nWould you talk someone out of jumping off a 50 story building?\n Yes\n\n That would be my answer yes :)\n \n What has that got to do with my statement?\n \n \n \nExcept the government owns the roads more than you do.\n\n It does not and cannot.\n \n \n \nThat is what I pay government to do.\n\n That's not all your paying for, you are also paying to have people rights violated and you should stop desiring this at the very least.\n \nRemember that when your neighbors dog is chasing you jumping from yard to yard to avoid the roads.\n\n I won't be avoiding any roads any time soon.\n \n You don't have the resources to build your own road system and I doubt you could gather enough support to build one which is paid for on the terms you appear to advocate.\n \n \nThen don't go\n\n I won't unless I am forced to.\n \n \nBut those rights have an order, when in conflict one must take precedence over the other. Law determines which.\n\n Your concept of law sickens me.\n \n \nShould I have thrown wet noodles at you to change your mind? \n\n No, and I don't want my mind changed. I am worried though that you merely did this to discredit me and that you did not actually accept the premises on which your argument was constructed.\n \n \nBetter than Mad Max.\n\n Aye, but that was assuming that my moral government existed and somehow everyone besides me agreed to live at the will of the collective.\n \n If I decline to exist in society right now much worse things will happen to me.\n \n \nI believe the problem will be to many qualified people regardless of the truth of it all deciding to do it themselves and accomplishing nothing useful.\n\n That is an opinion :)\n \n \nThat is an opinion\n\n It is the logical answer to your question.\n \n \nWhat if they want they system that is in place now.\n\n Then it as a whole could not be made private, the ownership of the current system is impossible to determine properly.\n \n Perhaps legal bodies should be formed representing the groups of people that use each section of road and shares equally distributed on that basis, however as I previously implied these legal bodies would not have the right to keep anyone off the roads.\n \n In any case they would quickly degrade without maintenance and the replacement roads would have clear ownership.\n \n \nWhich is granted them by the population\n\n Which is granted them by fact.\n \n I want an answer do you believe majority makes right? If so I have plenty of examples you need to explain to me.\n \n \nThere is no line they never appear except when you place them there.\n\n Explain\n \n \n \nIt does for the most part doesn't it? \n\n yes I suppose, the distinction is the necessity. You would not have to pay the mafia to avoid getting killed by the mafia if the mafia didn't threaten to kill you.\n \n \nI'll bring ballons\n\n emoticon_xhoho\n \n \nMakes for a bad potluck\n\n Does this sarcasm mean you have no response or you think I am defeated by these statements?\n \n \nNo the can leave and have their own party, but we were here first and matter cannot occupy the same place with other matter.\n\n A dodge; if you will not make them cooperate then unwillingness to cooperate will result in noncooperation.\n \n \nSo in other words the current system.\n\n No\n \n \n \nBecause you are, unless you renounce it\n\n I am not until I agree to it and all it's obligations.\n \n \nWell aren't you glad your choice is nothing like that\n\n It is submit, leave, or be imprisoned.\n \n I have chosen submit for now but I have not surrendered, I will attempt to convince anyone I can of the truth.\n \n \n, and as unfair and horrible as you hope to make the choice be by comparing it to something that isn't comparable there is always a choice.\n\n Which says nothing about the morality of the choice giver.\n \n If a mugger demands your wallet or he's going to kill you, you have a choice to die or give over the wallet.\n \n Yet you can still say he did not give you a choice, the only other choice you had was defying him, which was not a choice he offered to you.\n \n \nMaybe, but you are not naming it. The last attempt was a horrible name.\n\n What are you talking about?\n \n \n \nBlame your parents for birthing you into indentured servitude. \n\n I will blame the slaver who holds me in servitude, it is so much more logical.\n \n \n \nOne day maybe, not in my life time.\n\n People definitely act to protect their rights, their inability to consider anyone but themselves is what makes it appear as selfishness.\n \n \nBecause man is flawed. We don't fear an uprising of chickens or other barnyard animals violating our rights, we fear man will, because given the opportunity he has proven his inability to exist in harmony with his own species.\n\n some men are flawed because they fall into self re-enforcing delusions of man's flaws.\n \n Your belief that man is inherently flawed, that morality and life are an exercise in compromise, that ideals are never practical, and that rights conflict precludes any reliable behavior from you in keeping with what is true and good in ethics.\n \n A tribe of wall haters will agree men cannot live in houses.\n \n \nThe goal of law is stability and order and the protection of rights.\n\n I believe that is what I just said.\n \nIf you are not subject to the law you become part of the disorder and instability that violates rights.\n\n Insanity! a person can only violate rights by violating rights, no man is subject to the law every man is subject to morality and the law seeks to maintain morality, that process is called justice.\n \n If I were perfectly moral the whole of humanity wouldn't have the right to tell me to take off my hat.\n \n Criminals are subject to a proper law, not men.\n \n \nWithout consent every man will have his own law.\n\n Correction, he will have his own view of morality, it will be either correct or incorrect.\n \n He will deduce what law should be from that.\n \nAre you really ready to try the honor system with society?\n\n Where did you get that idea?\n \n \nThen participate in government and ....oh never mind. \n Why?\n\n Because they do not reflect morality and when they do I will ignore them.\n \n Proper laws demand men do the right thing and have protocol for when they don't.\n \n A moral man will never come in conflict with the proper law for he shall try to do what is right and will agree that if he fails there must be a protocol for such a time.\n \n A moral man need not change his mind or actions because of the law yet this law demands both of me.\n \n \nSeems you and government agree on at least some things.\n\n The government has done somethings that I would vote for in a free society, the government agrees with me on nothing for I disagree with it's authority to do whatever it pleases.\n \n \n \nYour confidence is inspiring. \n\n Thank you.\n \n \nYou say that government is guilty of theft because it imposes taxes on its citizens and uses the threat of seizure to demand a percentage of your property.\n\n Yes\n \nYou showed the definition of theft as something being taken without consent, permission, or right. Further stating you never agreed to obligate yourself nor does any person have the right to obligate you to government taxation. \n\n Yes\n \nIn order for a theft to occur there must be law.\n\n Why? Was nothing stolen before writing? Was nothing stolen by nazis?\n \nLaw establishes ownership and what constitutes a violation of ownership\n\n It identifies ownership and what constitutes a violation, nothing more.\n \n \nit is the means by which individuals create and maintain stability and order within their collective existence.\n\n It is the explicit declaration of the understanding of morality that certain society has.\n \nIt benefits the individual and the state, but law is by consensus.\n\n Everyone is an individual, do not place abstractions in comparisons to particulars.\n \nThe collective agrees what will be the laws, what will be the punishments, what is permitted to enforce the laws, and what is necessary to maintain the law.\n\n Yes\n \nThey agree to relinquish certain rights under certain circumstances, which permits law to function effectively. \n\n and that is an error. No law proper law requires the relinquishment of any rights for that is contrary to morality.\n \nYour position is that government has not the authority, nor can government be given the authority to compel your performance under conditions that it dictates.\n\n It is.\n \nYour defense though is to switch positions with government. Now you are mandating that government must perform under conditions that you dictate.\n\n What am I mandating?\n \nJust as you believe, you have no power to make government cease what you deem a violation of your rights you would remove government&#8217;s power to act against an individual.\n\n Show me where I have said this last.\n \nYou cannot say it is unfair simply because you want to be the one you deem is favored. It is either unfair or it is not.\n\n I never used the word unfair, I said immoral. Compulsion is immoral, the violation of rights is immoral and I permit no exceptions.\n \nGovernment was granted it&#8217;s authority through individuals.\n\n Who can only grant authority they themselves posses.\n \n These individuals have rights as you do.\n\n Yes\n \nThey have a right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n\n In truth the right to liberty is all that needs be said, for one does not have a right to life.\n \n All rights are properly expressed as a negative from other human beings \"a right to not be killed by other people\" but not a right to life, for we all die.\n \n \nUnder the rule of law, they established government to protect, enforce, and maintain those rights.\n\n yet the government violates them.\n \nYour desire to not be subject to the law is your right that government respects.\n\n It does not.\n \nThe conditions and obligations of citizenship may be renounced and you may do so at anytime.\n\n I have already.\n \nYou have no right to the protections and benefits offered by society if you choose not to abide by their laws.\n\n If I choose to reject societies terms is more correct.\n \nYour right to do as you please is not superior to my right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n\n No rights conflict, the proper analysis will show you that.\n \nYour actions in withholding the resources necessary for government to protect the rights of society\n[*]I have withheld no resources, I have turned all that was demanded over at virtual gunpoint[*]\"Society\" does not have rights\nwhile utilizing the resources of society is a violation of the individual and collective rights of every member of that society.\n\n I utilize what is mine, I will pay for what I use given the choice, nothing you say on this matter will change the fact that I have not been given a choice and so I cannot choose to use what I have not paid for.\n \n You have still not realized that charge is meaningless to me because it presupposes that the government has a right to the property it stole, it does not.\n \n You can say that no one has a right to the roads but that would mean that you are violating peoples rights every time you drive on it despite paying taxes meaning you have forfeited your rights meaning the first of us to stop using the system has the moral high ground. It's absurd and ridiculous.\n \n The roads were built using our money, both of us are willing to pay that money given the choice so we both have a right to the road.\n \n What you cannot say is that I do not have a right to the road because I don't believe the government has the right to take by force.\n \n All you have ever been able to say is that I would not have a right to the roads if I did not pay for the road and I have paid for the roads in the exact same manner you seem to think you have paid for the roads.\n \n I hope you realize that although this line of argument has been interesting it is now clearly defeated, and all it ever could of accomplished is to show I am a hypocrite which is a fallacy when attempting to disprove my initial conclusions.\n \nBy violating the rights of others, as you have acknowledged, you forfeit your rights.\n\n I have not violated the rights of anyone, and I eagerly await any attempt to prove I have or intend to.\n \n I like being on the defensive in arguments it typically does a better job at illustrating the fact that I have not overlooked any premises; but I will go on the offensive on this particular issue if you will not admit defeat.",

   "a native or naturalized member of a state or nation who owes allegiance to its government and is entitled to its protection (distinguished from alien). \n \n A proper government would be one which does not steal property.\n\n \n How should government be funded? What will not violate any rights and still allow government to be effective?\n \n \nNot under the terms that it would be offered me, however; I have not been offered any terms, I stopped saying the pledge of alliegance the moment I knew what it meant. I comply with government regulations and follow it's laws. I respond to the census and vote for it's leaders.\n\n \n You renounced your citizenship, you get to go build your Utopia elsewhere and no longer have to do those things and no jury duty either. \n \n \nbut I promise you if I was ever given a document to sign with the terms of citizen ship as they are forced upon the the people of this country, if I had to submit to any decision that congress, the president, the courts may make as price for this citizenship I would not sign it and I would bear any consequence for I would know that I had no choice.\n\n \n This is nothing but smoke and mirrors. You want to stay in the United States, I assume because what you like about it has greater value than what you dislike, but you here say if you have to submit you will bear any consequence. Earlier you renounce your citizenship, but also say you comply with government's taxation of people. Why, because you don't want to go to jail or you can't hope to win a fight against government. \n \n You argue that being left with a bad choice or to comply is not really being given a choice. Coming from someone who believes there is only right or wrong and that everything is a moral absolute this seems odd. Just as renouncing your citizenship and and then going about your day utilizing all the benefits granted a citizen without your morality being the slightest bit ruffled. Excusing your immoral position by saying the government stole from you so you are just recovering what was taken. Is this the morally right way to go about this? Considering you say government doesn't own anything that would mean you are taking from someone else who hasn't violated your rights.\n \n Your position of individual rights being superior to the collective and government should protect those rights above all others. How could it possibly do that? If it must uphold the rights of the individual it cannot enforce unless it knows without question a right has been violated. If an individual chooses not to discuss an accusation then that is the end of its ability to protect rights. \n \n How is the individual rights of one person superior to the rights of the collective? Rights are hypothetical until a consensus acknowledges and agrees to respect them. A group of individuals will not all have the same moral values nor will they value all morals the same. A rational person will relinquish conditionally, some rights in order to protect their person and other rights. The alternative is to be alone without the potential benefits of the group. \n \n Which individual will decide what constitutes a violation of anothers rights? Which individual will determine the punishment? Which individual will enforce and maintain order? Which individual will support this? How? No individual will do any of these things. The collective will. \n \n Your position is like and dislike. You don't like the method, you don't like the result, you don't like authority over you, but that doesn't make the concept false it makes the process false. If given the opportunity you wouldn't change the concept, just the process. The idea is the same, but the method is different. \n \n \nNow, answer the question; what have I said to deceive the government?\n\n \n You have renounced your citizenship. You are no longer permitted the benefits granted to citizens. Use of resources belonging to the United States and/or it's citizens is stealing. This country is a nation of laws. You may disagree or dislike them but that is our system and that is the law. If a law is deemed by the governed to be wrong they get together and change it. \n \n By the way your participation in a democracy does two things. Your acceptance of the process of government, which would include taxation. Why would you participate in an immoral invalid government? Secondly it shows you are contributing to the instability and disorder government is enacted to prevent. If you are not a citizen then there is no need for your participation in government. Your illegal attempts to influence American politics is neither moral or legal, violating the sovereign rights of the country and the liberty of the population.\n \n \nIt is an error to dismiss knowledge on the rationale that it does not integrate with your beliefs.\n\n \n Hence the qualifier\n \n \nWhen confronted with this situation what you should be doing is examining the support for both pieces of contradictory knowledge.\n\n \n To the extent it is available I am. \n \n \nIf you think that uncompromising morality is an error because it won't work you should be examining why it would not work.\n\n \n I think your application of it will not work. \n \n \nFurther practicality is not primary to morality, that is a lesson that history has taught us with many examples.\n\n \n I didn't say that it was, but morality does not necessitate complexity either. If given a choice whether a moral choice is difficult or easy the preference would be for easy.\n \n \nSorry I am to lazy right now to go and look at what it is in response to. I'll take it back until I figure it out.\n \n Prove I have been given a choice, to the best of my knowledge there is no program or provision for those who wish to pay for roads, police, military, ect but not taxes.\n\n \n I see because you have not been given a choice you find acceptable you have decided that there was no choice offered. You have choices the fact you don't like them or you believe them to be unfair isn't a consideration concerning the morality of taxation or if the government has violated your rights by imposing taxes and using threat of seizure to enforce it's legal right to tax.\n \n \nI love nazi/soviet/roman comparisons, I don't agree with this taboo against such comparisons they are very helpful.\n \n By taking a known evil and examining it's specific one can deduce evils relationship with the subject material.\n \n In other words if the analogy is sound it's the easiest way to arrive at such knowledge, if the analogy can be shown to be unsound it is again very telling.\n\n \n You can find similarities between just about every government over the last 2000 years. Comparing Fascist Germany's genocide against Jews to the question of citizenship in The US appears more of an attempt at sensationalism than anything else.\n \n \nThe only things I find absolutely necessary are life, rational thought, and rights, otherwise I would submit to this pseudo-slavery for I risk many such things by choosing to believe the truth.\n\n \n Are you willing to give any of those things up? No you are not. Your insincere dismissal of the importance of just a few of the things you take for granted that are the result of Government, not some private company, sounds like sour grapes.\n \n \nSo people who don't deserve to use the roads get to because it would be too much trouble to stop them?\n\n \n The concept of trying to do so is too ridiculous to even consider.\n \n \nbut were you a citizen by default or did you have to agree to it? you see there is a little law in this country where everyone gives everything to me, since you have been a citizen all your life you need to give everything you have to me. emoticon_smile\n\n \n Bummer, good thing I left to go live in a country that respects property rights. I will miss it there though. emoticon_xhoho\n \n \nRights do not contradict each other so no order of importance need be decided upon.\n\n \n A man has two children, twins, they are in an accident. As a result one needs a heart transplant and one needs a liver transplant. There are no available matching donors, both are 18 years old. Without the transplants both will die. The man can allow them both to die or save one using the other as a donor which will result in the donor dying. \n You have a moral obligation to preserve life, to not do harm and to not violate the rights of others. \n \n What is the correct moral choice?\n \n \nJust like your view of government the mere fact of contradicting rights would prove total morality impossible, all human life would be a compromise between good and evil.\n\n \n No. don't judge my views by your ideas. Compromise is necessary because there isn't a universal standard for morality. You can establish an act as immoral, but you cannot make another person accept that it is. In the US we consider the law on children in China immoral, but the Chinese see over population as immoral. Does the US have the right to invade China to make them allow people to have as many children as they want? Will the US have a moral obligation to preserve life when an overpopulated China begins to starve to death? \n \n \nIt does not and cannot.\n\n \n Are you chained to your house? Has your passport been confiscated? Will you die if you comply? No and No and No. You may go whenever you desire.\n \n \nThat's not all your paying for, you are also paying to have people rights violated and you should stop desiring this at the very least.\n\n \n Isn't that what is being discussed?\n \n \nI won't be avoiding any roads any time soon.\n\n \n The moral high road seems out of your way.\n \n \nYour concept of law sickens me.\n\n \n I am not thrilled by your victimy whining, but it is what it is.\n \n \nNo, and I don't want my mind changed. I am worried though that you merely did this to discredit me and that you did not actually accept the premises on which your argument was constructed.\n\n \n I don't make a good devil's advocate and I don't have the brain power to come up with an ideology on a whim.\n \n \nIf I decline to exist in society right now much worse things will happen to me.\n\n \n Exactly. The rational person will choose to make concessions for their greater benefit, just as you have. The current system may not be perfect (is not) but it is superior to the alternative. Not having to live in the possibility of a life outside of the protection of government has value for you. If it didn't you wouldn't be here. Your problem is with authority. Somebody telling you without your input what you are going to do. \n \n You don't have to like it, but if you want to change it, do it within the parameters of the system. Democracy gives you the ability you say you don't have to cause the system to change more to your liking. That doesn't mean snap 3 times and your wish is granted. Government gives you the right to pursue happiness it doesn't guarantee you will find it.\n \n \nI want an answer do you believe majority makes right? If so I have plenty of examples you need to explain to me.\n\n \n Sometimes it is, other times not. \n \n Do you believe the majority has less right or credibility than the minority? If 10 people want to do something and 5 don't and they agreed prior to accept whatever the outcome of the vote was, shouldn't the majority decision be set into motion?\n \n \nExplain\n\n \n You were referring to a line item bill, something that doesn't exist.\n \n \nDoes this sarcasm mean you have no response or you think I am defeated by these statements?\n \n\n \n I am responding as I am responded to, I will refrain from attempts to lighten the exchange.\n \n \nI am not until I agree to it and all it's obligations.\n\n \n So if someone says take a bite and you eat the whole thing it's their fault for offering you the bite? You have accepted by your participation in the governments politics or were you compelled to vote also? You have accepted by the fact that you were made aware of the obligations and chose to accept them.\n \n \nIt is submit, leave, or be imprisoned.\n\n \n Well there are three options.\n \n \nI have chosen submit for now but I have not surrendered, I will attempt to convince anyone I can of the truth.\n\n \n And look there is a fourth.\n \n \nWhich says nothing about the morality of the choice giver.\n \n If a mugger demands your wallet or he's going to kill you, you have a choice to die or give over the wallet.\n \n Yet you can still say he did not give you a choice, the only other choice you had was defying him, which was not a choice he offered to you.\n\n \n But is still a choice available to you. You spend so much time on absolutes and now you find situations that can be a choice but are not really a choice. Remove like or dislike from the equation and it's a choice or it isn't. In this case you have choices, not ones you would like to have but better than he just kills you and takes your wallet.\n \n \nWhat are you talking about?\n\n \n I don't think enslave papillionia is a good name for a country. It sets a bad tone and doesn't sound appealing to potential immigrants. emoticon_smile\n \n \nI will blame the slaver who holds me in servitude, it is so much more logical.\n\n \n The best you can hope for is indentured servant. Government is an abstract entity just doing what it was made to do. You don't blame a garbage disposal for chewing up a fork, who turned it on with the fork in there?\n \n \nPeople definitely act to protect their rights, their inability to consider anyone but themselves is what makes it appear as selfishness.\n\n \n Government is an attempt to think beyond oneself. If only for self preservation, the formation of government shows the value the individual attributes to what the group can provide.\n \n \nsome men are flawed because they fall into self re-enforcing delusions of man's flaws.\n\n \n Some are flawed because they fail to recognize the potential they offer to their fellow man. Being unable to recognize it in themselves they cannot see it in their neighbors either.\n \n \nYour belief that man is inherently flawed, that morality and life are an exercise in compromise, that ideals are never practical, and that rights conflict precludes any reliable behavior from you in keeping with what is true and good in ethics.\n\n \n Man flaws do not prohibit him from overcoming them. Look at how much he has progressed from the days of clubbing his neighbor to grow his crops. Life is not a compromise and if we teach morality to be held in greater regard than it currently is it may then achieve a universally accepted standard. Man is his own greatest obstacle in attaining this. I don't believe I said all ideal are impractical. Rights will conflict or must be compromised to some degree until such time as they are universally practiced and respected. The idea that someone forfeits their rights is taking them away. Enforcing that forfeiture is a violation of what are supposed to be inalienable rights done by a third party that most often wasn't present nor was effected by the violation. How is it not a violation to arrest someone on a suspicion they violated anothers rights. You don't know they did, you just think they may have. But while you figure it out they are sitting in a jail cell deprived of their freedom.\n \n \nA tribe of wall haters will agree men cannot live in houses.\n\n \n Until someone shows them the benefits of doing so\n \n \nInsanity! a person can only violate rights by violating rights, no man is subject to the law every man is subject to morality and the law seeks to maintain morality, that process is called justice.\n\n \n Police arrest a man on suspicion of a criminal act. He has violated no persons rights, yet his are violated. Turns out he didn't do it. \n \n Police go to question someone on the suspicion they may have committed a crime. He doesn't wish to discuss it. They have only circumstantial evidence. Do they arrest him? Take him to the station against his will to question him? Do they have the right to violate his rights when it is unknown if he violated another persons? How do you determine if a violation occurred without violating someone's rights?\n \n \nIf I were perfectly moral the whole of humanity wouldn't have the right to tell me to take off my hat.\n\n \n That comment alone will cause you to lose that hat\n \n \nCriminals are subject to a proper law, not men.\n \n\n \n Then all men do not have the same rights as you stated earlier. Criminals are people same as everybody else. They either have rights or the don't. They are either inalienable or they are not. With the exception of the circumstances of how they found themselves in the respective predicaments there is little difference between a slave and an inmate. By the way who defines proper law? Do you have to accept it or is it just forced upon you?\n \n \nCorrection, he will have his own view of morality, it will be either correct or incorrect.\n \n He will deduce what law should be from that.\n \n\n \n And if two people come to different conclusions and both are wrong or both are right? Your making morality subjective, it would need to be what it is regardless of how he views it.\n \n \nBecause they do not reflect morality and when they do I will ignore them.\n\n \n Then all men are not equal.\n \n \nProper laws demand men do the right thing and have protocol for when they don't.\n\n \n Yes\n \n \nA moral man will never come in conflict with the proper law for he shall try to do what is right and will agree that if he fails there must be a protocol for such a time.\n \n A moral man need not change his mind or actions because of the law \n\n \n Seriously? You say never followed by try, but if he is wrong, which would be changing his mind, he will agree that he should be subject to and will submit to some form of him not being capable of fully exercising one or more of his inalienable rights.\n \n \nThe government has done somethings that I would vote for in a free society, the government agrees with me on nothing for I disagree with it's authority to do whatever it pleases.\n\n \n My understanding is the government can't do whatever it pleases. It has a process it follows for everything.\n \n \nWhy? Was nothing stolen before writing? Was nothing stolen by nazis?\n\n \n Law is a result of writing? \n \n \nIt identifies ownership and what constitutes a violation, nothing more.\n \n\n \n It is also how morality will become universal. It states it in no uncertain terms. It causes it to be understood and practiced. It is what binds order and stability to society. It allows for the existence of civilization, it permits man to spend his time learning and expanding his knowledge instead of preparing to defend himself from any who would kill him or enslave him. It keeps him free and allows him to express himself. \n \n You have a habit of minimizing the value of things you see as interfering with your philosophy or attributing them to concepts more to your liking. \n \n \nI never used the word unfair, I said immoral. Compulsion is immoral, the violation of rights is immoral and I permit no exceptions.\n\n \n Do animals have rights? Why?\n \n \nWho can only grant authority they themselves posses.\n\n \n Do parents have authority over their children? Why does that authority suddenly vanish at 18? Why can they drive at 16, but can't drink until 21? Can the state hold someone who may be a threat to themselves? Can man act preemptively or must he wait?\n \n \nIn truth the right to liberty is all that needs be said, for one does not have a right to life.\n \n All rights are properly expressed as a negative from other human beings \"a right to not be killed by other people\" but not a right to life, for we all die.\n\n \n So rights are a result of man needing protection from himself or are they at the discretion of others who do not to you? If you are alone on an island you would have no rights or you would have no need to have rights, but still have them? Do you have the right to exist? Or does someone not have the right to make you not exist\n \n Earlier you said man has rights because of what he is. This would suggest he has rights because someone else refrains from acting against him. There is a difference between you have a right to the truth and you have a right that someone not lie to you. The first is your right dependent on nothing but you. The second is dependent on another who may simply not tell you and be morally correct, as they have not lied and you may not compel them to tell\n \n \n\"Society\" does not have rights\n \n\n \n What individual brings charges against a criminal? Or is the charge made by the people?\n \n \nI utilize what is mine, I will pay for what I use given the choice, nothing you say on this matter will change the fact that I have not been given a choice and so I cannot choose to use what I have not paid for.\n\n \n What is yours? Where did what you claim is yours come from? Everything you claim to own came from some immoral act. The land your house is on was stolen before you were born. The car you drive is made from materials that by your definition would be not have been the property of the car manufacturer because they can't own what belongs to someone else and everything belonged in one form or another to someone else. Did the personal possessions of the Jews the Nazi's killed belong to the people who bought it from them? How many hands must property pass through to no longer be stolen property?\n \n \nYou have still not realized that charge is meaningless to me because it presupposes that the government has a right to the property it stole, it does not.\n\n \n But you do?\n \n \nYou can say that no one has a right to the roads but that would mean that you are violating peoples rights every time you drive on it despite paying taxes meaning you have forfeited your rights meaning the first of us to stop using the system has the moral high ground. It's absurd and ridiculous.\n\n \n You renounced your citizenship that is why you don't get the benefits of being a citizen.\n \n \nThe roads were built using our money, both of us are willing to pay that money given the choice so we both have a right to the road.\n\n \n see above\n \n \nWhat you cannot say is that I do not have a right to the road because I don't believe the government has the right to take by force.\n\n \n I am not saying that\n \n \nAll you have ever been able to say is that I would not have a right to the roads if I did not pay for the road and I have paid for the roads in the exact same manner you seem to think you have paid for the roads.\n\n \n emoticon_wow that is what you got from everything I have said? emoticon_xdonno\n \n \nI hope you realize that although this line of argument has been interesting it is now clearly defeated, and all it ever could of accomplished is to show I am a hypocrite which is a fallacy when attempting to disprove my initial conclusions.\n\n \n Well ya if you ignore a 1/4 of it refuse to acknowledge 1/2 of it and say you don't care about an 1/8 of it and get sidetracked on the reat I can see why would come to that conclusion. emoticon_xhoho\n \n \nI like being on the defensive in arguments it typically does a better job at illustrating the fact that I have not overlooked any premises; but I will go on the offensive on this particular issue if you will not admit defeat.\n\n \n Let it not be said I did not fight until the end.\n \n I think your going to be playing offense and defense. I think to switch from a what if scenario to actual and then apply that to well I do pay taxes so I can use the roads therefore your argument has nothing to do with my original statement and I have defeated you is hard to believe something that would come from you.",

   "How should government be funded? What will not violate any rights and still allow government to be effective?\n\n Voluntary fees, the baseline being maintenance for the voting structure.\n \n \nYou renounced your citizenship, you get to go build your Utopia elsewhere and no longer have to do those things and no jury duty either. \n\n Renounced it? I never accepted it. Yet I am one.\n \n You know the little \"you just won a million dollars\" thing on the top of the websites?\n \n I am not going to complain if they send me a million dollars and I am not going to click on it and agree to publicly sacrifice my neighbors pet to get the million.\n \n and for the last time what right do you or anyone else have to make me leave?\n \n \nThis is nothing but smoke and mirrors. You want to stay in the United States, I assume because what you like about it has greater value than what you dislike, but you here say if you have to submit you will bear any consequence.\n\n Consequences like deportation and imprisonment.\n \nEarlier you renounce your citizenship,\n\n I cannot renounce what I never agreed to.\n \nbut also say you comply with government's taxation of people.\n\n Because they have guns, there is nothing rational about telling a mugger to get lost while they have a knife to your throat.\n \n \nWhy, because you don't want to go to jail or you can't hope to win a fight against government. \n\n You got it.\n \n \nYou argue that being left with a bad choice or to comply is not really being given a choice.\n\n I have choices I am not being given choices, this is not very hard to understand I gave a perfect analogy with the concentration camps.\n \n The Nazi's offered death in a gas chamber, but the Jews had other choices. The Jews were still only being offered one choice, which is an oxymoron because one choice is no choice i.e. the Jews were being given no choice.\n \n\n Coming from someone who believes there is only right or wrong and that everything is a moral absolute this seems odd.\n\n What about it seems odd? Do you think I should go down as a bloody martyr or something?\n \n \nExcusing your immoral position by saying the government stole from you so you are just recovering what was taken.\n\n It's a good excuse.\n \nIs this the morally right way to go about this?\n\n Yes, in fact it's the civilized way to go about this. I would have the right to try to cheat on pretty much all of my taxes but I don't.\n \n As you say I am not staying here out of the goodness of my heart, there is no where with significantly better laws than here and I may as well endure tyranny with friends and family; yet it remains true that even if I did go it would not be because of a moral imperative or any foolish right you seem to think the collective has given you to claim the whole of this country for people who want your all or nothing public works system.\n \n \nConsidering you say government doesn't own anything that would mean you are taking from someone else who hasn't violated your rights.\n\n Why? Who owns the roads?\n \n \nYour position of individual rights being superior to the collective\n\n Abstractions and particulars again in the same list.....\n \nand government should protect those rights above all others. How could it possibly do that?\n\n With laws, police force, courts; and there are no others.\n \n \nIf it must uphold the rights of the individual it cannot enforce unless it knows without question a right has been violated.\n\n Aye\n \nIf an individual chooses not to discuss an accusation then that is the end of its ability to protect rights. \n\n \"nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself\"\n Got that part already.\n \n \nHow is the individual rights of one person superior to the rights of the collective?\n\n The collective does not exist except as a concept, the individual does.\n \n A collective with no individuals will be null, therefore there are no independent attributes of a collective.\n \n A collective is what it's members are.\n \n A collectives rights are it's members rights.\n \n This question can be logically manipulated to read \"How is the rights of one/few person(s) superior to the rights of many?\"\n \n The answer is they are not, they are exactly the same.\n \n \nRights are hypothetical until a consensus acknowledges and agrees to respect them.\n\n The recognition of rights, not rights.\n \n The existance of gravity did not wait for Newton.\n \n \nA group of individuals will not all have the same moral values nor will they value all morals the same.\n\n They perceive different moral values, I believe it's pretty clear I believe in an objective morality.\n \n \nA rational person will relinquish conditionally, some rights in order to protect their person and other rights.\n\n Name for me a reason other than some one is forcing you?\n \n \nThe alternative is to be alone without the potential benefits of the group. \n\n There is a third possibility a society of free equals, a group of people living together without anyone of them surrendering any of their rights. What about this concept threatens you?\n \n \nWhich individual will decide what constitutes a violation of anothers rights? \n\n Ideally the one(s) who knows how to identify a violation.\n \nWhich individual will determine the punishment?\n\n Ideally the one(s) who have objective judgement as the the relative seriousness of crimes.\n \n \nWhich individual will enforce and maintain order?\n\n Ideally one who is able to do so safely and is not corrupt with their military power.\n \n \nWhich individual will support this? \n\n Anyone who wants to live in a safe society.\n \nHow?\n\n With wealth and their best judgements.\n \nNo individual will do any of these things.\n \n Many individuals can.\n \nThe collective will. \n\n Yes\n \nYour position is like and dislike. You don't like the method, you don't like the result, you don't like authority over you, but that doesn't make the concept false it makes the process false.\n\n Of what concept are you speaking?\n \n If given the opportunity you wouldn't change the concept, just the process. The idea is the same, but the method is different. \n \n Concept of a social contract? oh of course I would change it, I would create a proper one.\n \n As for it being false did you think I was an anarchist?\n \n \nYou have renounced your citizenship.\n\n Just consider this the official response for every time you say this: I cannot renounce what I have not agreed to.\n \n \nYou are no longer permitted the benefits granted to citizens. \n\n I have a right to what has been stolen from me.\n \n It is not my fault all this stealing and collectivist XXXX has been going on and you can't tell exactly what percentage of public property I have a right to but my wealth has been taken and used to build it I am recovering stolen property and the fact that millions of others do the same thing every day is proof to me that had it not been stolen from me the money would have done the exact same thing.\n \n I don't own the whole road system just the share of one commuter, and I know that you cannot prove this false so why are you even trying?\n \n \nUse of resources belonging to the United States and/or it's citizens is stealing.\n\n Only if it's the United State's property.\n \n Why is it stealing for me but not you to use the roads while living under the same tax laws as you if the only difference between us is I think I have a right to choose if I pay for them?\n \n \nThis country is a nation of laws. You may disagree or dislike them but that is our system and that is the law. If a law is deemed by the governed to be wrong they get together and change it.\n \n Your point?\n \nBy the way your participation in a democracy does two things. Your acceptance of the process of government\n\n That's got to be a joke.\n \nwhich would include taxation. \n\n You know the two foxes and a hen, does the hen voting that they not eat her mean she accepts it if they do because there are two of them?\n \n \nWhy would you participate in an immoral invalid government?\n\n You have said several times that if the government is wrong people change it by a vote. If it is possible I will try to make the US gov moral by the current process.\n \n I have nothing to lose by this act, I can vote without the clause \"and whatever the majority decides is right\" and my support of the government is in the form of wealth stolen from me, which I cannot change by sitting around not voting; So I am not supporting an invalid immoral government by participating in it's internal change system.\n \n If I lived in the time of Rome I would both leap for the opportunity to fill the senate with ethical brave people and a chance to destroy rome and establish a free society of some kind in her place; it would depend which came first.\n \n The goal of universal liberty supersedes any ridiculous sense of fair play I might have with the parasites and thugs who seek the violation of rights.\n \n Secondly it shows you are contributing to the instability and disorder government is enacted to prevent.\n\n By voting...\n \n If you are not a citizen then there is no need for your participation in government.\n\n I am a citizen, and were I not I would be working to overthrow the current government.\n \nYour illegal attempts to influence American politics is neither moral or legal, violating the sovereign rights of the country and the liberty of the population.\n\n sovereign rights of the country? like what?\n \n You can threaten someone's liberty by casting a vote that is true, but I have never done it and I would never do it on purpose.\n \nI think your application of it will not work. \n\n Have any better suggestions?\n \n \n \nI didn't say that it was, but morality does not necessitate complexity either. If given a choice whether a moral choice is difficult or easy the preference would be for easy.\n\n I don't seem to run into difficult moral choices anymore, I don't mean difficult because they might cause discomfort I mean difficult because they are hard to decide.\n \n \n \nI see because you have not been given a choice you find acceptable you have decided that there was no choice offered.\n\n No choice was offered, I was given the following ultimatum not by the government but those who believe in the system as you do:\n \"Stay pay your taxes and vote\" or \"leave\"\n \n Since you do not have the right to offer me the second choice I am offered one: \"pay your taxes and vote\"\n \n I have the option of choosing something that you have not offered but that does not mean I was offered a choice.\n \n The offering of a single choice is a demand.\n \n You in your attempt to name me a hypocrite have pointed out that I could be given the choices \"pay your taxes vote\" or \"leave our society\"\n \n That is true I could be given that choice and I would make it for I find freedom to be superior to society, but to offer it in it's entirety you would need everyone else but me to back you up, a situation I find unlikely.\n \n I bet there are few people on this very forum who \"renounce their citizenship\" if they believed there was a better way.\n \n I have siblings and parents whom would choose the latter, There would be a good chunk from the ARI, we could get Palin to shoot some moose for us :)\n \n That is worst case though, I fully expect that if the situation came to pass; it would be you who would have to make a choice to live in our voluntary society or be without a vote.... or roads emoticon_xhoho\n \n \nYou have choices the fact you don't like them or you believe them to be unfair isn't a consideration concerning the morality of taxation or if the government has violated your rights by imposing taxes and using threat of seizure to enforce it's legal right to tax.\n\n If a choice offered is immoral it is about as considerable as they come.\n \n If some one holds a gun to you and says \"give me your wallet or don't\" the second option makes a world of difference.\n \n He becomes some weird threatening kook but not a robber.\n \n Now if he said \"give me your wallet or your car keys\" he would be giving you a choice but not one he has the right to offer you.\n \n \nYou can find similarities between just about every government over the last 2000 years. Comparing Fascist Germany's genocide against Jews to the question of citizenship in The US appears more of an attempt at sensationalism than anything else.\n\n I will not argue against that, but I won't stop using these comparisons either.\n \n Nazi Germany is a known evil, history has lessons to teach us and there is no reason to start debates about whether a different government was evil or not just to avoid being called a sensationalist when the analogous components are right there in the third reich.\n \n The nazi's showed us where the error is in our socio-economic-politics, and it is not where many people want it to be.\n \n It is not in lack of democracy, lack of patriotism, lack of compassion, it is in the evils of moral relativism, subjectivism, pragmatism, and all the other names for fallacies, most children of collectivist premises, all children of faulty reasoning.\n \n \nAre you willing to give any of those things up? No you are not.\n\n Thank you emoticon_love\n \nYour insincere dismissal of the importance of just a few of the things you take for granted that are the result of Government, not some private company, sounds like sour grapes.\n\n I take nothing for granted, you take too much.\n \nThe concept of trying to do so is too ridiculous to even consider.\n\n I'll take that as a yes.\n \nBummer, good thing I left to go live in a country that respects property rights. I will miss it there though. emoticon_xhoho\n\n Sorry, this country is the entire planet.\n \n \nA man has two children, twins, they are in an accident. As a result one needs a heart transplant and one needs a liver transplant. There are no available matching donors, both are 18 years old. Without the transplants both will die. The man can allow them both to die or save one using the other as a donor which will result in the donor dying. \n\n Ouch, that's a hard decision to make for both of them.\n \nYou have a moral obligation to preserve life, to not do harm and to not violate the rights of others. \n\n I accept only the last.\n \nWhat is the correct moral choice?\n\n It's not a moral choice. You ask the brothers what they want to do and that is what is right.\n \n Neither have a right to each others organs and the father has rights to neither organs.\n \n If you cannot speak to them you make a decision based on what you think they would have wanted, but that is not a question about the morality of the choice you believed to have existed it is a dilemma about deciding intentions without certainty. That is certainly a dangerous area.\n \n However this is an unusually clear example for that situation since both will die without a transplant you can safely say that neither would prefer them both to die.\n \n \nNo. don't judge my views by your ideas.\n\n It is too late for that, why should I not?\n \nCompromise is necessary because there isn't a universal standard for morality.\n\n There is, ethics contains no subjective knowledge and is universal. If it is not universal I would go so far as to say there is no moral import.\n \n What insanity would drive something to believe something can be right for them but wrong for others I do not know, but I do know about people who study these things: Criminal psychiatrists.\n \n \nYou can establish an act as immoral, but you cannot make another person accept that it is.\n\n I can make an argument.\n \nIn the US we consider the law on children in China immoral, but the Chinese see over population as immoral. Does the US have the right to invade China to make them allow people to have as many children as they want?\n\n Yes\n \nWill the US have a moral obligation to preserve life when an overpopulated China begins to starve to death? \n\n No\n \n \nAre you chained to your house? Has your passport been confiscated? Will you die if you comply? No and No and No. You may go whenever you desire.\n\n Are you going to continue with Red herrings?\n \n \n \nIsn't that what is being discussed?\n\n It is, you have not argued against my orginal conclusion though you have said that if it is true then I am not following my own standard of morality.\n \n \nI don't make a good devil's advocate and I don't have the brain power to come up with an ideology on a whim.\n\n Meaning I presume that you simply went for the easiest path to discredit me without considering if you actually had a counter to my first argument?\n \n \nExactly. The rational person will choose to make concessions for their greater benefit, just as you have. \n\n Haha, I was not talking about what happens outside of society I am talking about what society does to people who try to leave it.\n \n Yet you are correct that is exactly what a rational person will choose to do, they will not, however; concede their rights. Their existance as a rational person is those rights.\n \nThe current system may not be perfect (is not) but it is superior to the alternative.\n\n Not to my alternative, and not to anarchy.\n \nNot having to live in the possibility of a life outside of the protection of government has value for you.\n\n Not living outside the protection of a government has value for me.\n \nYour problem is with authority. Somebody telling you without your input what you are going to do. \n\n but they have my input, that's what voting is.\n \n My problem is with anyone telling me to do anything, and expecting that act to be equivalent to my own judgement telling me to do anything. If that is authority I have a problem with authority.\n \n What I think of as authority is when someone who knows better than you AND you KNOW that he/she knows better tells you to believe or do something.\n \n That for me is a compound decision, I first decide that their judgement in whatever the subject matter may be is superior to my own, then I decide to follow the superior judgement.\n \n Two decisions both mine, all people should live like this. Look at sandy canes signature; 'Unthinking respect for authority\" that is what I have a problem with.\n \n \nYou don't have to like it, but if you want to change it, do it within the parameters of the system.\n\n Or outside the parameters of the system or in any way I can :)\n \nDemocracy gives you the ability you say you don't have to cause the system to change more to your liking. That doesn't mean snap 3 times and your wish is granted. Government gives you the right to pursue happiness it doesn't guarantee you will find it.\n\n I am not sure what you mean.",

Keep in mind I will insist that you stay with that premise, finding a situation that is right which also corresponds with the majority's will does not mean that the majority made it right.\n \n In fact to prove such a situation exists you need to find an example of something that was wrong until the majority changed that status and that the majority was the only thing that could do so.\n \n \nDo you believe the majority has less right or credibility than the minority?\n\n Nope\n \nIf 10 people want to do something and 5 don't and they agreed prior to accept whatever the outcome of the vote was, shouldn't the majority decision be set into motion?\n\n Yes\n \n \nYou were referring to a line item bill, something that doesn't exist.\n\n I see, well never mind then..... \n \n \nI am responding as I am responded to, I will refrain from attempts to lighten the exchange.\n\n So to you my answers sounded sarcastic?\n \n \n \nSo if someone says take a bite and you eat the whole thing it's their fault for offering you the bite?\n\n No\n \nYou have accepted by your participation in the governments politics or were you compelled to vote also?\n\n I have\n \nYou have accepted by the fact that you were made aware of the obligations and chose to accept them.\n\n Yea that would do it, except I didn't choose to accept them, nor have they been presented to me in formal manner.\n \n\n And look there is a fourth.\n\n That's the first.\n \n \nBut is still a choice available to you.\n\n and so is jumping off a cliff, does that mean someone has the right to corral me on three sides with a cliff on the third?\n \n \nYou spend so much time on absolutes and now you find situations that can be a choice but are not really a choice.\n\n Your inability to tell the difference between choices offered and choices real is not my responsibility.\n \nRemove like or dislike from the equation\n\n They weren't there, that's the result.\n \nand it's a choice or it isn't. In this case you have choices, not ones you would like to have but better than he just kills you and takes your wallet.\n\n So beat it punk?\n \n Men have never been able to control each others thoughts absolutely, yet men have been enslaved often.\n \n The fact that I have a choices has no bearing on whether the government is offering me choice sets it has the right to offer.\n \n \nI don't think enslave papillionia is a good name for a country. It sets a bad tone and doesn't sound appealing to potential immigrants. emoticon_smile\n\n Well there are two of me in this country and one of you and I really don't want to change the population.\n \n \n \nThe best you can hope for is indentured servant. Government is an abstract entity just doing what it was made to do. You don't blame a garbage disposal for chewing up a fork, who turned it on with the fork in there?\n\n No I don't; I blame for the violation of my rights and the rights of so many in this country those who believe it is right and voted for it.\n \n I blame you, I blame people who voted for Obama, I blame everyone who claims to know what morality is then tells you that it's different for everyone so he/she can't judge.\n \n \nGovernment is an attempt to think beyond oneself.\n \n Good luck with that mystical enlightenment thing.\n \n \nSome are flawed because they fail to recognize the potential they offer to their fellow man.\n\n None are flawed for THAT reason.\n \n \nMan flaws do not prohibit him from overcoming them. Look at how much he has progressed from the days of clubbing his neighbor to grow his crops. Life is not a compromise and if we teach morality to be held in greater regard than it currently is it may then achieve a universally accepted standard. Man is his own greatest obstacle in attaining this.\n\n Not man, men.\n \nI don't believe I said all ideal are impractical.\n\n It is the inescapable implication of moral relativism and subjectivism. If an ideal does not exist except for one man than it is impractical to apply that ideal to more than that man.\n \nRights will conflict or must be compromised to some degree until such time as they are universally practiced and respected.\n\n The boy had been trying to build a boat for 15 years, but it would never float. Finally he spoke to a shipwright and asked him to see what he was doing wrong.\n \n The shipwright came and asked the boy to show him how he fixed a leak, the boy calmly drilled into the hull above and below the seam of two leaky planks, threaded and tied a taught contracting cord binding the two planks together tightly through the holes.\n \n He said \"there now that seam won't leak anymore.\"\n \n The shipwright said with a amused smile \"but the two holes will.\"\n \n If you are waiting for a time when all rights are universally respected to believe that no right may be violated for any reason, pappillion; you will be waiting a long time.\n \n \nThe idea that someone forfeits their rights is taking them away.\n\n A forfeited right is still a right.\n \nEnforcing that forfeiture is a violation of what are supposed to be inalienable rights done by a third party that most often wasn't present nor was effected by the violation.\n\n The first party is not the only one who may act. When someone steals something they forfeit their right to remain free, anyone could imprison them at that point without violating rights.\n \nHow is it not a violation to arrest someone on a suspicion they violated anothers rights. You don't know they did, you just think they may have. But while you figure it out they are sitting in a jail cell deprived of their freedom.\n\n That would be a provision they would sign the constitution for, if you had some one who was suspected of being a criminal who did not sign the constitution you would run a real risk of violating rights if he is innocent.\n \n A criminal case for kidnapping would then be in order but to have access to legal representation in the courts he would have to sign the constitution.\n \n Situations may be difficult but I am interested primarily about getting everyone on the same principles, I don't believe all decision making will stop just because the nation has declared what is right and wrong.\n \n \nUntil someone shows them the benefits of doing so\n\n I'm trying.... I could use your help.\n \n \nPolice arrest a man on suspicion of a criminal act. He has violated no persons rights, yet his are violated. Turns out he didn't do it. \n\n Turns out he has a case to sue the police.\n \n\n Police go to question someone on the suspicion they may have committed a crime. He doesn't wish to discuss it. They have only circumstantial evidence. Do they arrest him?\n\n No\n \nTake him to the station against his will to question him? Do they have the right to violate his rights when it is unknown if he violated another persons?\n\n No, innocent until proven guilty remember?\n \nHow do you determine if a violation occurred without violating someone's rights?\n\n By investigation, don't you watch law and order? They don't have a right to a confession even if they arrest him.\n \n \nThat comment alone will cause you to lose that hat\n\n Not by my hand.\n \n \nThen all men do not have the same rights as you stated earlier.\n\n Prove the contradiction please.\n \nCriminals are people same as everybody else.\n\n They are people, they are no the same as everybody else.\n \nThey either have rights or the don't.\n\n They have rights.\n \nThey are either inalienable or they are not.\n\n They are.\n \nWith the exception of the circumstances of how they found themselves in the respective predicaments there is little difference between a slave and an inmate.\n\n That is true.\n \nBy the way who defines proper law? \n\n The people within the confines of a proper code of absolute morality.\n \nDo you have to accept it or is it just forced upon you?\n\n As I said before a moral man does not need to concern himself with it, a criminal has it forced on him.\n \n \n \nAnd if two people come to different conclusions and both are wrong or both are right?\n\n If they are both right then they are non-contradictory, if they are both wrong they are both wrong.\n \nYour making morality subjective\n\n That's going to be... difficult to prove.\n \nit would need to be what it is regardless of how he views it.\n\n It is.\n \n \n \nThen all men are not equal.\n\n and netflix delivers thousands of movies every day?!\n \n\n Seriously? You say never followed by try, but if he is wrong, which would be changing his mind, he will agree that he should be subject to and will submit to some form of him not being capable of fully exercising one or more of his inalienable rights.\n\n A moral man can make a mistake (that is do something wrong) but to continue to be moral he will recognize that he has forfeited some of his rights by this act. By this recognition he still does not come into conflict with the law because he does not disagree that it's protocol must now apply.\n \n \nMy understanding is the government can't do whatever it pleases. It has a process it follows for everything.\n\n So it can do whatever it pleases in certain ways. The people vote, elected officials make laws. Enough elected officials can even change the constitution.\n \n If enough people voted for officials who voted to change the constitution to make it legal kill Mary Perkins in Iowa that could happen without violating the constitution, for it has provision for amending itself.\n \n \n \nLaw is a result of writing? \n\n Not always, but you know what I mean. It is the result of the social order which guarantees morality about as much as mob rule does.\n \n \nIt is also how morality will become universal.\n\n No morality is universal, and law recognizes that fact; even the faulty ones we have today leave no room for people who think their personal opinion of morality exempts them from the law.\n \n \nIt states it in no uncertain terms. It causes it to be understood and practiced. It is what binds order and stability to society. It allows for the existence of civilization, it permits man to spend his time learning and expanding his knowledge instead of preparing to defend himself from any who would kill him or enslave him. It keeps him free and allows him to express himself. \n\n I agree.\n \n \nYou have a habit of minimizing the value of things you see as interfering with your philosophy or attributing them to concepts more to your liking. \n\n Pappillion, look I have gone through this a thousand times; I wouldn't be here acting like a prophet from heaven if I wasn't sure I was right.\n \n You can say this is all personal opinion, or \"likes dislikes\" all you want but I will summarily ignore you on that point.\n \n These posts are huge and a lot of it is filled with this kind of XXXX, can we stay on subject?\n \n \n \nDo animals have rights? Why?\n\n No, they are not sentient.\n \n \nDo parents have authority over their children?\n\n No\n \nWhy does that authority suddenly vanish at 18? \n\n Arbitrary things like that are an indication that something does not exist for a rational purpose, investigate their reasons when you find them.\n \n \nWhy can they drive at 16, but can't drink until 21?\n\n They can drive whenever the road holders decide they may, since we (as we have seen) have a screwed up public service system right now you won't get a concrete answer out of me.\n \n They can't drink till 21 because most people believe they have the right to stop them.\n \nCan the state hold someone who may be a threat to themselves? \n\n No\n \nCan man act preemptively or must he wait?\n\n Assuming you mean self-defense he may act preemptively but only with proof that his target is planning to violate his rights.\n \n \nSo rights are a result of man needing protection from himself \n\n For the purposes of this argument you could say that, since no rights are violated except by other men.\n \nIf you are alone on an island you would have no rights or you would have no need to have rights, but still have them?\n\n The latter\n \nDo you have the right to exist?\n \n You cannot, if you like I will show you how to identify the list of proper rights.\n \n Unlike other techniques this one produces rights which never contradict each other and nature yet retain the full definition of moral action proceeding from individual liberty.\n \nOr does someone not have the right to make you not exist\n\n This is true.\n \nEarlier you said man has rights because of what he is. This would suggest he has rights because someone else refrains from acting against him. \n\n No, he has rights because of what he is and those rights cannot be violated so long as someone else refrains from acting against him.\n \n A violation does not constitute a nullification, if it did the right to not be stolen from would disappear as soon as you were stolen from so the thief would have violated no right. So a right cannot exist because of a lack of violation.\n \nThere is a difference between you have a right to the truth and you have a right that someone not lie to you.\n\n Yes there is.\n \nThe first is your right dependent on nothing but you. The second is dependent on another who may simply not tell you and be morally correct, as they have not lied and you may not compel them to tell\n\n but it is dependant on more than you, it is dependant on nature. If you lived in a blackened room for your entire life (and no one put you there) nature itself would have denied you your right to the truth about what everything looks like outside.\n \n Nature does not violate rights, the first is not a right.\n \n \nWhat individual brings charges against a criminal? Or is the charge made by the people?\n\n One person or many may make a charge.\n \n \nWhat is yours? Where did what you claim is yours come from?\n\n My property I define as the product of my mind and labor and anything I trade for it.\n \nEverything you claim to own came from some immoral act.\n\n None of what I claim to own came from some immoral act of mine, very little of it is recovered loot.\n \nThe land your house is on was stolen before you were born.\n\n No I don't believe so, especially since one cannot own land but merely claim it.\n \nThe car you drive is made from materials that by your definition would be not have been the property of the car manufacturer because they can't own what belongs to someone else and everything belonged in one form or another to someone else.\n\n That is untrue.\n \nDid the personal possessions of the Jews the Nazi's killed belong to the people who bought it from them?\n\n No\n \n How many hands must property pass through to no longer be stolen property?\n\n An infinite number (provided none are the hands that it was stolen from)\n \n (as a side note do not confuse abandoned property - such as property left after death without a will or natural heir with stolen property)\n \nBut you do?\n\n Of course not, tell me who I stole from and I will give it back I promise.\n \n \nYou renounced your citizenship that is why you don't get the benefits of being a citizen.\n\n The roads are not a benefit of citizenship as far as I am concerned it's a benefit of my money going to build and maintain roads.\n \n \nemoticon_wow that is what you got from everything I have said? emoticon_xdonno\n\n Well as far as the whole ad hominem yea.\n \n \nWell ya if you ignore a 1/4 of it refuse to acknowledge 1/2 of it and say you don't care about an 1/8 of it and get sidetracked on the reat I can see why would come to that conclusion. emoticon_xhoho\n\n If you don't have time to respond just wait till you do, don't add filler like this.\n \n \nI think to switch from a what if scenario to actual and then apply that to well I do pay taxes so I can use the roads\n\n My offense will consist entirely of what if scenarios. Your offense did as well, it was \"what if\" I didn't pay for the roads.\n \ntherefore your argument has nothing to do with my original statement and I have defeated you is hard to believe something that would come from you.\n\n Your arguments had nothing to do with my original statement because if you could somehow prove I did not live up to my own philosophy that would not be proof that my philosophy is invalid.",

   "Under what circumstances does majority make right? Keep in mind I will insist that you stay with that premise, finding a situation that is right which also corresponds with the majority's will does not mean that the majority made it right.\n\n \n Our system tries not to assume most people will agree on a course of action. One of the reasons we vote. Majority is subject to whim and emotion and that contributes to laws being passed that are later rescinded or modified by the same or different majority. There are other situations, but I will try and be short and simple with responses. \n \n \nIn fact to prove such a situation exists you need to find an example of something that was wrong until the majority changed that status and that the majority was the only thing that could do so.\n\n \n The majority voted to make slavery illegal in the United States.\n \n \nSo to you my answers sounded sarcastic?\n\n \n No. They were.\n \n \nYea that would do it, except I didn't choose to accept them, nor have they been presented to me in formal manner.\n\n \n This is getting silly repetitive. In the country you reside in, regardless of why, your signature on a document is not necessary to form a binding agreement. It is but one of several methods and the strongest, but not the only. The actions of government and yourself would lead any reasonable person to believe that such an agreement does exist. In addition to the actions of both, you have failed to properly notify government of your intention or desire to terminate the agreement. If the cable company turns on a subscription service and you didn't order it, but you get a bill for it, most people will call and say I didn't order this, I am not paying for it so stop billing me for and I won't use it. This is a rational and morally correct response to the problem. An immoral choice would be to not pay the bill, not say anything to the cable company, continue to use it and justify it by saying they charge to much to begin with you are just recovering what by rights is yours.\n \n Spin it any way you want. The bottom line is you have had plenty of opportunity to terminate being under the jurisdiction of The US. You did not do so, why doesn't matter. You are a US Citizen, with that comes responsibilities and obligations. \n \n Your reason that you were not given a choice isn't valid. What you mean is you were not given a choice you liked and presented in a way you felt appropriate. I don't see silently waiting for something to happen you know isn't going to and then using that it hasn't as support for a claim is not a good argument.\n \n Your dislike of the alternatives is unfortunate, but not something that can be construed as immoral or a violation of a person's rights. The proper moral decision isn't taking advantage of a situation that causes harm to another.\n \n \n \nThe fact that I have a choices has no bearing on whether the government is offering me choice sets it has the right to offer.\n\n \n The government offers you a choice on whether to stay or go. Taxes are not a choice, they are an obligation resulting from your citizenship. What you deem a violation of your rights is your misinterrpretation of the process. What you call extortion can only be true if government attempts to collect more than you are legally responsible for. have to valid claim Well there are two of me in this country and one of you and I really don't want to change the population.\n \n \nNo I don't; I blame for the violation of my rights and the rights of so many in this country those who believe it is right and voted for it.\n \n I blame you, I blame people who voted for Obama, I blame everyone who claims to know what morality is then tells you that it's different for everyone so he/she can't judge.\n\n \n Most people in jail blame other people, because they are unhappy with the results of their situation. They think if it's the other person then maybe something will change for them, but the opposite is true. A person only has control over themselves if it is someone else you have no ability to change anything. \n \n Your rights are being violated because you want them to be. No they really aren't, but it's a way to direct emotion at a cause that you can unload on. Your smart enough to develop a convincing argument that it's true, but the rights of the government if all things were equal would be the same as yours. The government has not acted to secretly to take from you with its only purpose being to benefit itself. No that wouldn't make a violation OK if they asked nicely and promised you a pony, the point is that they are acting within the framework they were given and in the open and within the law. There is no infringement of your rights especially if your standards are applied. If it must be right or wrong then they are acting within their rights and you are protesting but not willing to exercise your rights to prevent it.\n \n \nGood luck with that mystical enlightenment thing.\n\n \n Thanks I'll send you a postcard.\n \n \nNot man, men.\n\n \n There are no men, only individual mans close together.\n \n \nIf you are waiting for a time when all rights are universally respected to believe that no right may be violated for any reason, pappillion; you will be waiting a long time.\n \n\n \n I know that is why I said this already.\n \n \nA forfeited right is still a right.\n\n \n Your car is your car, it's not my car, but it is a car.\n \n \nThe first party is not the only one who may act. When someone steals something they forfeit their right to remain free, anyone could imprison them at that point without violating rights.\n\n \n What I am pointing out is where your absolutes run into problems. When you say rights must not be violated, no exceptions I believe you mean no exceptions. When you talk about morality I see a conflict between it is either right or wrong period with kidnapping a kidnapper to punish him for holding someone against their will because that is appropriate. I agree it is, but I am also not saying there is no exception to right and wrong and everything is one or the other\n \n \nThat would be a provision they would sign the constitution for, if you had some one who was suspected of being a criminal who did not sign the constitution you would run a real risk of violating rights if he is innocent.\n\n \n Which means you wouldn't do it because violating his rights his of greater concern than justice.\n \n Here is your argument. He doesn't want to sign you don't have the right to force him to nor the right to make him leave. You can't even follow him to see if he is going to do some violent act so your can catch him red handed. No violating rights, no exceptions. Therefore until you can prove beyond any doubt you do nothing to him. \n \n Reasonable doubt would not suffice as a criteria for judgment. Innocent people often find their rights violated. No exceptions would place the potential of violating the suspects rights more important that protecting the public. \n \n \nA criminal case for kidnapping would then be in order but to have access to legal representation in the courts he would have to sign the constitution.\n\n \n Sort of like how you need to be a US citizen to vote, cause the change you want to have happen, work to make money and enjoy your weekends at your home thinking about how morally bankrupt the government is for doing what they were intended to do. Why start over, your only a few sentences away from what you already have.\n \n \nTurns out he has a case to sue the police.\n\n \n Turns out the police wouldn't waste their time. \n \n \nNo, innocent until proven guilty remember?\n\n \n You have no law enforcement. This is what I meant by the honor system. You can not question a suspect, you can not even put him on trial because to do so would require you to violate his liberty before you have proven his guilt. How do you think you will ever be able to prove beyond a doubt that he committed the crime? \n \n \nBy investigation, don't you watch law and order? They don't have a right to a confession even if they arrest him.\n \n\n \n Investigate how? No subpoena power, no arrest power and a court system that could not even make someone appear for a traffic ticket You thought getting people for jury duty was hard now. \n \n \nThey are people, they are no the same as everybody else.\n\n \n How many species of human are there?\n \n \nThe people within the confines of a proper code of absolute morality.\n\n \n They must be working on the enlightenment thing.\n \n \nand netflix delivers thousands of movies every day?!\n\n \n Trying as hard as I can to not understand this as sarcasm, not doing it well.\n \n \nA moral man can make a mistake (that is do something wrong) but to continue to be moral he will recognize that he has forfeited some of his rights by this act. By this recognition he still does not come into conflict with the law because he does not disagree that it's protocol must now apply.\n\n \n And if he disagrees, not with there are repercussions, but that it is excessive by comparison to his mistake?\n \n \nSo it can do whatever it pleases in certain ways. The people vote, elected officials make laws. Enough elected officials can even change the constitution.\n\n \n Yes they can\n \n \nIf enough people voted for officials who voted to change the constitution to make it legal kill Mary Perkins in Iowa that could happen without violating the constitution, for it has provision for amending itself.\n\n \n If Mary hadn't done something to forfiet her rights none of this would have been necessary. \n \n \nPappillion, look I have gone through this a thousand times; I wouldn't be here acting like a prophet from heaven if I wasn't sure I was right.\n\n \n I would be careful with that. Look at what happened to the last guy who said that.\n \n \nYou can say this is all personal opinion, or \"likes dislikes\" all you want but I will summarily ignore you on that point.\n \n These posts are huge and a lot of it is filled with this kind of XXXX, can we stay on subject?\n\n \n OK\n \n I should have guessed you wouldn't like the first and would dislike the second.\n \n \nAssuming you mean self-defense he may act preemptively but only with proof that his target is planning to violate his rights.\n \n\n \n \nbut it is dependant on more than you, it is dependant on nature. If you lived in a blackened room for your entire life (and no one put you there) nature itself would have denied you your right to the truth about what everything looks like outside.\n \n Nature does not violate rights, the first is not a right.\n\n \n So after stating these posts are long, which they are, and asking nicely to stay on topic you blow off the point I am making with a claim have no relevance to and which would cause a response from me taking us in another direction. \n \n I will leave it with I disagree\n \n \nMy property I define as the product of my mind and labor and anything I trade for it.\n\n \n So does the government.\n \n \nNone of what I claim to own came from some immoral act of mine, very little of it is recovered loot.\n\n \n Because you didn't physically participate gives you a free pass? The same sentence you say none of it, except for a little bit of it?\n \n Indians would disagree.\n \n \nNo I don't believe so, especially since one cannot own land but merely claim it.\n\n \n I claim your land, move over and make room I am bringing friends and we are going to listen to bad music while watching silent movies\n \n \n(as a side note do not confuse abandoned property - such as property left after death without a will or natural heir with stolen property)\n\n \n I don't think I was especially when I made clear it was the Nazi's who sold the possessions of the Jews they had killed. I assume that the killer would not qualify as happening upon unclaimed property now that his victim was dead.\n \n \nOf course not, tell me who I stole from and I will give it back I promise.\n\n \n What are the names of the ones who stole from you?\n \n \nThe roads are not a benefit of citizenship as far as I am concerned it's a benefit of my money going to build and maintain roads.\n\n \n A couple things open up from this statement. First to be clear the roads were just one of a number of examples I gave concerning things provided by the government. Because it was just a point I wanted to touch on to establish Government does provide a great many things for its citizens that you utilize without thinking about. I purposely left it just with roads because yes these are getting unmanageable. \n \n So after this no more roads. Taxes do not buy you use, if that were the case we would have no tourists industry. What would be keeping you from use is you would be here illegally since renouncing your citizenship. Breaking the law is why you would not be permitted. It is also a morally bad choice.\n \n As far as your concerned Government is immoral because it is extorting money from you, but that is not possible. As a matter of fact it would be immoral to not pay taxes under your philosophy.\n You have an agreement that you have had the freedom and opportunity to terminate, but have not. A condition of that agreement is to obey laws and pay taxes you are morally obligated to do both until you end the agreement. \n \n As far as Government is concerned it is justified expecting you to fulfill your obligation. It has a right to expect you to comply both morally and legally. What you call theft and is really extortion is only in response to your failure to uphold your responsibilities and to enforce it's rights and the rights of it's citizens. By not complying with the law and still under the jurisdiction of the government you have forfeited your rights by your failure to act.\n \n \nIf you don't have time to respond just wait till you do, don't add filler like this.\n\n \n emoticon_wow That is cute. Tell you what I won't post comments like this if you don't post responses that warrant them. emoticon_xgood\n \n \nMy offense will consist entirely of what if scenarios. Your offense did as well, it was \"what if\" I didn't pay for the roads.\n\n \n ok, it wasn't just what if but what if you do?\n \n \nYour arguments had nothing to do with my original statement because if you could somehow prove I did not live up to my own philosophy that would not be proof that my philosophy is invalid.\n\n \n What my intent was for you to either commit to a position or show that it could not be applied universally. Some did and some did not, most did even if not shown immediately.",

   "I am just ignoring anything I find irrelevant these posts are getting too long.\n \n \n \nThe majority voted to make slavery illegal in the United States.\n\n That is not an example.\n \n \n\n No. They were.\n\n Not the ones your responded to sarcastically.\n \n \nThis is getting silly repetitive.\n\n Then stop trying it, you think I would miss something like my own life and where I live when I constructed my philosophy?\n \n \nIn the country you reside in, regardless of why, your signature on a document is not necessary to form a binding agreement.\n\n Because you have said so, there is no real reason.\n \nIt is but one of several methods and the strongest, but not the only. The actions of government and yourself would lead any reasonable person to believe that such an agreement does exist.\n\n and if a private company did this to you? I think there would be a law suit on the table.\n \n There is only one method to make an agreement at that is for both parties to state their terms and both parties agree.\n \nIn addition to the actions of both, you have failed to properly notify government of your intention or desire to terminate the agreement.\n\n An agreement that does not exist need not be canceled.\n \nIf the cable company turns on a subscription service and you didn't order it, but you get a bill for it, most people will call and say I didn't order this, I am not paying for it so stop billing me for and I won't use it.\n\n Good analogy, to be accurate we will need to shed a little more light on the circumstances. The cable company tells you to pay for the subscription service or get out of any neighbor hood they deliver cable to; you insist you aren't going to use it but they inform you that the majority of cable customers think it should be a package deal that it would be inefficient to keep track of all the different plans people want to have.\n \n You tell them that if that's the case you don't even want any cable, it's too expensive now.\n \n They tell you again to get out of any neighbor hood they deliver cable to.\n \n You respond and say that they don't own the neighbor hood and you don't have to have cable if you don't want to.\n \n They then threaten you with imprisonment and fines and assure you that your subscription will be collected by their agents.\n \n This infuriates you but a friend of yours points out that you do like watching normal cable shows and that so long as you want that it's a violation of the cable companies rights to not pay this subscription.\n \n You tell her that you would be glad to pay for the shows you want, but that doesn't mean the cable company has the right to take my money and threaten me with imprisonment.\n \n She looks at you with disappointment as says \"Well if the majority of cable watchers say they do; they do. It sounds as if you don't want to watch TV at all, why do you have to whine like this anyway? everyone has to pay their subscription\"\n \n You seriously wonder how your friend could say that but since you aren't argumentative you leave it alone. Later someone moves into the neighborhood, you have a welcome to the street party for him and he explains to you how he never watches TV, hes just a book reading type; he mentions that he noticed the former occupants forgot to cancel their cable service and asked if anyone knew how to contact them so they wouldn't have to pay for what they weren't using anymore.\n \n You become good friends with this fellow and he comes to you next month and asks how he got a bill addressed to him for the cable when he didn't even call the cable company to get signed up.\n \n You sigh and tell him that by living in the neighbor hood your consent to cable subscription is implied, that if you didn't want it you should have called them to say so.\n \n He says that's ridiculous they can't charge someone without a contract but shrugs and picks up the phone to call.\n \n In a horrifying flashback you remember what happened when you tried to cancel your extended subscription, you urge him to forget about it.\n \n He calls anyway and hangs up with a white face, a couple weeks later he finally decides to see if there is anything good on TV figuring he may as well get what he can for what their taking from him.\n \n That same friend you told you that you were whining then tells him that he tried to call and cancel his whole subscription, which means he doesn't have the right to watch anything, he points out that they didn't ask him if he wanted to be a subscriber and they didn't let him stop being one, how is it only now that what he wants matters.\n \n There now that analogy is complete.\n \n \nThis is a rational and morally correct response to the problem.\n\n That is the best morally correct response, the other is simply don't pay the extra amount.\n \nAn immoral choice would be to not pay the bill, not say anything to the cable company, continue to use it and justify it by saying they charge to much to begin with you are just recovering what by rights is yours.\n\n The only immorality would be using the subscription service you aren't paying for.\n \n If they took your money and did not refund you, you could use it. If you didn't pay extra you could still morally use what you paid for.\n \n If they combined it into one subscription you would only have the right to pay for it all and use it all or pay for nothing and use nothing.\n \n If they didn't have the right to combine it into one subscription because they were not owners of the cable network they wouldn't have the right the charge you anything.\n \n \nSpin it any way you want. \n\n I steer towards the facts.\n \nThe bottom line is you have had plenty of opportunity to terminate being under the jurisdiction of The US.\n\n Yes I could have left long ago.\n \nYou did not do so, why doesn't matter.\n\n I agree, no \"why\" would have made my movement in or out of the country relevant to my rights as a human being.\n \nYou are a US Citizen\n\n So I'm told.\n \nwith that comes responsibilities and obligations. \n\n Again so I'm told.\n \nYour reason that you were not given a choice isn't valid.\n\n Want to repeat that? The fact that I did not agree to any agreement isn't valid as proof that I am not in an agreement?\n \n Does anyone want to hear that from an industrialist?\n \n (speaking to a coal miner who is having respiratory problems and suing a mining company)\"Your reason that you were not given a choice whether to work in the darkest hell holes isn't valid, simply by showing up at work you consented to being forced to where ever the company wanted\"\n \n \nWhat you mean is you were not given a choice you liked and presented in a way you felt appropriate.\n\n Yea that's what me and the coal miner mean. emoticon_rolleyes\n (that was sarcastic)\n \n \nYour dislike of the alternatives is unfortunate, but not something that can be construed as immoral or a violation of a person's rights.\n\n What can be construed as immoral or a violation of a person's rights is such a violation.\n \n \nThe proper moral decision isn't taking advantage of a situation that causes harm to another.\n\n The only harm that could come of a moral government is to parasites, the very free riders that you would love to paint me as.\n \n \nThe government offers you a choice on whether to stay or go.\n\n That is true.\n \nTaxes are not a choice, they are an obligation resulting from your citizenship.\n\n Would I be presented with the terms that I be a citizen and pay whatever the majority deems or not be a citizen I would choose to not be a citizen.\n \n I would certainly not become a citizen of such a country, but as I stated I believe enough other people would not want to so that I could still have most of the benefits of a society.\n \n \nWhat you deem a violation of your rights is your misinterrpretation of the process.\n\n Yes I probably missed something, let's see a government claiming the right to the wealth of anyone within it's borders. well I guess I didn't.\n \nWhat you call extortion can only be true if government attempts to collect more than you are legally responsible for.\n\n I am morally responsible only for what I use, and responsible only to those who own the thing which I use.\n \n Everything you say belongs to this government in fact belongs to the people.\n \n Yes there is a difference.\n \n \nA person only has control over themselves if it is someone else you have no ability to change anything. \n\n You are incorrect, communication and force are both methods to change others.\n \n \nYour rights are being violated because you want them to be.\n\n That deserves to go in a signature.\n \nNo they really aren't\n\n Whew!\n \nbut it's a way to direct emotion at a cause that you can unload on.\n\n Um, so I am saying all this because I am angry and need to direct my emotions somewhere?....\n \nYour smart enough to develop a convincing argument that it's true,\n\n I promised myself long ago that if I heard a sound argument that something was true or false I would believe it, there should not be a two layered choice for any of us. You do not judge something on it's truth value then decide if you want to believe it.\n \n In other words you should not be able to say an argument is convincing but it did not convince me, that means either your wrong or you mistook what the adjective \"convincing\" should mean when applied to an argument.\n \n \nbut the rights of the government if all things were equal would be the same as yours.\n\n Exactly\n \nThe government has not acted to secretly to take from you with its only purpose being to benefit itself.\n\n Point being?\n \nNo that wouldn't make a violation OK if they asked nicely and promised you a pony, the point is that they are acting within the framework they were given and in the open and within the law. \n\n I realize that, and that's why I don't blame elected officials for doing their jobs as best they can, nor citizens for voting as best they can.\n \n The only thing I blame someone for is actively pursuing the violation of rights.\n \n Ignorance is no excuse.\n \nThere is no infringement of your rights especially if your standards are applied.\n\n You have tried a couple times to show that, I don't agree that you succeeded.\n \nIf it must be right or wrong then they are acting within their rights and you are protesting but not willing to exercise your rights to prevent it.\n\n Their rights (as I've said a million times) are the same as everyone else's.\n \n It is not wrong to enact legislation that violates no rights no matter what the frame work, it is always wrong to enact legislation that violates rights no matter how enlightened anyone may think the framework is.\n \n You like package deals but that's not how the world works, no person or government is always right or always wrong, always moral or always immoral.\n \n I can say the government has no right to do something while maintaining it has the right to exist.\n \n As for my right to prevent it; running from oppression has been the option of many throughout history it is simply illogical for me at this time, that does not mean that it is not oppression.\n \n \nWhat I am pointing out is where your absolutes run into problems. When you say rights must not be violated, no exceptions I believe you mean no exceptions.\n\n I do.\n \nWhen you talk about morality I see a conflict between it is either right or wrong period with kidnapping a kidnapper to punish him for holding someone against their will because that is appropriate.\n\n you can't kidnap a kidnapper, as you cannot murder a murderer. You can take a kidnapper by force and kill a murderer, but it is not wrong because it is in defense of rights.\n \n \nI agree it is, but I am also not saying there is no exception to right and wrong and everything is one or the other\n\n Allowing you to decide what is right and wrong based on what you feel it should be.\n \n \nWhich means you wouldn't do it because violating his rights his of greater concern than justice.\n\n In all honesty if the police aren't sure enough to risk legislation they shouldn't be arresting anyone anyway.\n \n \nHe doesn't want to sign you don't have the right to force him to nor the right to make him leave.\n\n Yes\n \nYou can't even follow him to see if he is going to do some violent act so your can catch him red handed.\n\n Who says you can't follow him :p\n \nNo violating rights, no exceptions. Therefore until you can prove beyond any doubt you do nothing to him. \n\n beyond reasonable doubt, but yes. If you have no proof someone is guilty you don't throw them in jail or fine them.\n \n \nReasonable doubt would not suffice as a criteria for judgment.\n\n Why?\n \n Innocent people often find their rights violated. No exceptions would place the potential of violating the suspects rights more important that protecting the public. \n\n The potential would be the judgement of the law enforcement officers, no exceptions means no exceptions, not risk no exceptions.\n \n If a police officer is sure the suspect is guilty they will be sure they are not violating rights.\n \n If they are wrong then by definition they did not have proof that the suspect was guilty and they should be punished for violating an innocent persons rights.\n \n It would not be proper to say that you must never arrest anyone because you risk violating their rights.\n \n If a risk exists then you cannot prove they are guilty which means you are risking sending an innocent person to prison or worse.\n \n Such a risk should never be taken, yes a few bad guys may get off because of it we already work on the premise that imprisoning an innocent man is worse than letting evil doers go.\n \nSort of like how you need to be a US citizen to vote, cause the change you want to have happen, work to make money and enjoy your weekends at your home thinking about how morally bankrupt the government is for doing what they were intended to do. Why start over, your only a few sentences away from what you already have.\n\n I don't see the connection\n \n \n \nTurns out the police wouldn't waste their time. \n\n Good\n \n \n \nYou have no law enforcement.\n\n Law enforcement requires violation of rights?\n \nYou can not question a suspect\n\n Why?\n \nyou can not even put him on trial because to do so would require you to violate his liberty before you have proven his guilt.\n\n Whether he committed the crime or not is what is relevant to whether he forfeited his rights or not; What has been proven is not.\n \n A trial is to confirm that the police were correct in arresting a suspect, it is not the proof of guilt.\n \n It is the police's responsibility to avoid arresting people for whom they do not have enough evidence to prove they are guilty.\n \n If someone is found innocent at trial it does mean the police should not have cuffed them and thrown them in jail, how can you deny this?\n \nHow do you think you will ever be able to prove beyond a doubt that he committed the crime? \n\n beyond reasonable doubt.\n \n \nInvestigate how?\n\n By investigating?\n \n \nHow many species of human are there?\n\n 1\n \n \n \nTrying as hard as I can to not understand this as sarcasm, not doing it well.\n\n That was sarcasm, I thought what you said was a completely random statement given what it was in response to.\n \n \nAnd if he disagrees, not with there are repercussions, but that it is excessive by comparison to his mistake?\n\n Then he would disagree with them, but he cannot evoke any right to determine the punishment.\n \n \nIf Mary hadn't done something to forfiet her rights none of this would have been necessary. \n\n Assume she didn't\n \n \nBecause you didn't physically participate gives you a free pass?\n\n Explain?\n \nThe same sentence you say none of it, except for a little bit of it?\n\n I did not say except.\n \nIndians would disagree.\n\n With?\n \n \nI claim your land, move over and make room I am bringing friends and we are going to listen to bad music while watching silent movies\n\n I'm using it.\n \n \nWhat are the names of the ones who stole from you?\n\n I don't know them all, but I know who they are by way of definition.\n \n \nAs far as your concerned Government is immoral because it is extorting money from you, but that is not possible.

Meets the conditions you asked for.\n \n \nThen stop trying it, you think I would miss something like my own life and where I live when I constructed my philosophy?\n\n \n But it is not a rational argument. What do you gain by going on a per use tax basis vs. what is in place now? Your tax basis would skyrocket. You would still have to pay the rate established by the government for what you did use. If you did not pay, just as with a car or house, if you don't make the payment they take the car or house. If you owe more then they get a judgment and take your property to satisfy the debt. Per use would be no different. All you do is pay more for less and the ability to say you are only paying for what you use. There is no benefit to you for doing this the way you want.\n \n \nBecause you have said so, there is no real reason.\n\n \n No because contract law and the supreme court say so. Reason enough for me and you as well as long as you continue to be a member of society.\n \n \nand if a private company did this to you?

There are a number of ways to make an agreement and agreement does not need to be in writing to be understood by both.\n \n \nAn agreement that does not exist need not be canceled.\n\n \n True but that isn't the case here.\n \n \nGood analogy, to be accurate we will need to shed a little more light on the circumstances.....\n\n \n Your version has circumstances that might apply to a private company, but not government. It also has situations that there is no comparison. Government does not deport yo for not paying your taxes is one example.\n \n \nThere now that analogy is complete.\n\n \n It also is no longer relevant to the argument.\n \n \nWant to repeat that? The fact that I did not agree to any agreement isn't valid as proof that I am not in an agreement?\n \n\n \n Sure but what I am saying is your actions put you in the agreement. There is a process, very simple and not in the least bit difficult, to terminating that agreement. You have not terminated it until you do it correctly.\n \n \n(speaking to a coal miner who is having respiratory problems and suing a mining company)\"Your reason that you were not given a choice whether to work in the darkest hell holes isn't valid, simply by showing up at work you consented to being forced to where ever the company wanted\"\n\n \n He must be suing for kidnapping, enslavement and assault otherwise he could have quit when he was told to go work in the darkest hell hole. \n I bet he is happy there is a disinterested third party that had established his ability to sue and would enforce anything they determined he was entitled to for the mining companies violation of laws that were also established by that third party.\n \n \nWhat can be construed as immoral or a violation of a person's rights is such a violation.\n\n \n Because you understand it to be doesn't mean it is.\n \n \nThe only harm that could come of a moral government is to parasites, the very free riders that you would love to paint me as.\n \n\n \n You forgot, if we are to follow you examples, being unstable and ineffective at protecting its citizens and most likely collapsing.\n \n \nWould I be presented with the terms that I be a citizen and pay whatever the majority deems or not be a citizen I would choose to not be a citizen.\n\n \n But yet everyday you remain one. \n \n \nI would certainly not become a citizen of such a country, but as I stated I believe enough other people would not want to so that I could still have most of the benefits of a society.\n\n \n Why would you think you would get any of the benefits of society by not participating in it? Why would you be entitled to enjoy the efforts of others without obligation? Doesn't that describe a parasite?\n \n \nYes I probably missed something, let's see a government claiming the right to the wealth of anyone within it's borders. well I guess I didn't.\n\n \n Not familiar with that. Doesn't happen with the US Government.\n \n \nI am morally responsible only for what I use, and responsible only to those who own the thing which I use.\n\n \n Do you pay only for what you use for your children, wife, mom or dad? Who would that check be made out to or do you have no moral responsibility to them?\n \n \nEverything you say belongs to this government in fact belongs to the people.\n\n \n communitarianism, communism, socialism and maybe a few other isms that would be true to some extent, but not so in the US. You would have to establish every penny the government has ever had has been the result of theft. Which is impossible to do since it isn't the case.\n \n \nI promised myself long ago that if I heard a sound argument that something was true or false I would believe it, there should not be a two layered choice for any of us. You do not judge something on it's truth value then decide if you want to believe it.\n \n In other words you should not be able to say an argument is convincing but it did not convince me, that means either your wrong or you mistook what the adjective \"convincing\" should mean when applied to an argument.\n\n \n I can make an observation that I understand why your argument would convince some people while stating I was not convinced.\n \n \n \nAs for my right to prevent it; running from oppression has been the option of many throughout history it is simply illogical for me at this time, that does not mean that it is not oppression.\n \n\n \n inconvenient. It would be illogical to remain being violated if you could escape that violation.\n \n \nyou can't kidnap a kidnapper, as you cannot murder a murderer. You can take a kidnapper by force and kill a murderer, but it is not wrong because it is in defense of rights.\n\n \n There is no defense the violation has already occurred. The arrest and detention is a separate event. As you agreed it is not moral to steal from a thief. Arresting and punishing the perpetrator is retribution. If the kidnapper holds the victim for 5 days why is he in turn held 5, 10 maybe 20 years. Making all things equal the victim's cost was 5 days the perpetrators cost is 730 times that on a 10 year sentence or 3,645 days more. That isn't a violation of rights under your philosophy?\n \n \nbeyond reasonable doubt, but yes. If you have no proof someone is guilty you don't throw them in jail or fine them.\n\n \n Having reason is not the same as having proof suffucient to prove guilt. Arresting someone on suspicion and finding out later it was someone else would be a violation of that person's rights. Your philosophy only supports beyond doubt.\n \n \n \nIf a police officer is sure the suspect is guilty they will be sure they are not violating rights.\n\n \n Which means \"Sir we would like to ask you some questions concerning a crime.\" Response \"I don't want to.\" \"ok have a nice day, goodbye.\"\n \n \nIf they are wrong then by definition they did not have proof that the suspect was guilty and they should be punished for violating an innocent persons rights.\n\n \n So much for justice, stability and order and effective law enforcement.\n \n \nIt would not be proper to say that you must never arrest anyone because you risk violating their rights.\n\n \n You can't ever prove their guilt if you can't compel them to show up in court to be tried. You can't compel them to court because you can't prove their guillt.\n \n Such a risk should never be taken, yes a few bad guys may get off because of it we already work on the premise that imprisoning an innocent man is worse than letting evil doers go.\n \n Some try all except for maybe some of the really dumb ones.\n \n \nLaw enforcement requires violation of rights?\n\n \n Under your idea of rights it does without question and therefore law enforcement as we understand it cannot exist\n \n \nWhether he committed the crime or not is what is relevant to whether he forfeited his rights or not; What has been proven is not.\n\n \n Don't you have to prove he did it to establish he violated rights?\n \n \nIf someone is found innocent at trial it does mean the police should not have cuffed them and thrown them in jail, how can you deny this?\n\n \n Do you think they will ever find Ron Goldman and Denise Brown's murderer? Sometimes the guilty go free.\n \n \nThen he would disagree with them, but he cannot evoke any right to determine the punishment.\n\n \n This would be the majority or society making the determination of what will happen to someone should they not follow the laws that the majority or society have established prior to any violation of rights.\n Imposing in some instances a penalty for transgressing th law but violating no person's rights.\n \n \n When you say government does not have the right to take your property I assume you only refer to obligations you deem a violation of your rights. In the event there were some reason you believed valid you would not consider that a violation and pay it. \n \n So what is your property? The fruits of your labor, but without society you have no labor nor do you have fruits from it. The idea that you have a an inalienable right to possess property is a product of society. You are after all born with nothing. You could not survive on your own for a number of years. It is society that gives you the environment that allows you to live, to grow, to achieve success. As a child you are incapable of making decisions, others must make them for you. In doing so they may violate your rights. I asked you if the state may hold someone believed to be a danger to themselves you said no. You also said the state cannot act preemptively. So grounding your child is a violation. If a 10 year old wants to leave home it is a violation of his rights to not let him. If he wants to drive a car he should be allowed to. Society says no that would be irresponsible and the potential harm outweighs the violation of rights. Society has determined that if you wish to live in it you must agree to its laws, some of which you may think are a violation of your rights. You argue by what right does society say where you can live? They don't they say if you want to live here then you must obey the laws or suffer the consequences or live somewhere else. \n \n Your philosophy sounds great on paper until you really look at what would happen in real life. Even if you are right, and everybody agrees taxes are theft you end up doing almost everything the current government does just only making it far more expensive and far less effective. Since it is an irrational course of action it cannot be considered the right choice.",

   "Works for me. Meets the conditions you asked for.\n\n It does not.\n \n \nWhat do you gain by going on a per use tax basis vs. what is in place now? \n\n I gain plenty from that, but my argument is about morality, and an \"all or nothing\" government funding is not inherently immoral.\n \n What is inherently immoral is stealing, no matter what system you choose to fund a government it may not morally violate rights and that is what I argue against.\n \n That being said it is practically impossible to create an all or nothing moral funding system.\n \n It would require whomever should want that to basically segregate themselves into a separate society, and each of them would have to agree to pay for whatever the majority deems.\n \n Very few people would really agree to that given the choice, especially if they see a rational choice.\n \n My government idea supports the concept of multiple social contracts but there really need not be more than one national system, and if there were it would still not have the right to violate the rights of individuals.\n \n \nYour tax basis would skyrocket.\n\n What do you mean?\n \nYou would still have to pay the rate established by the government for what you did use.\n\n I wouldn't trade one open book price with another.\n \nIf you did not pay, just as with a car or house, if you don't make the payment they take the car or house. If you owe more then they get a judgment and take your property to satisfy the debt.\n\n That's only if you are in debt, they cannot take your assets on the premise that you want to use their service if you do not actually use it.\n \n \nPer use would be no different. All you do is pay more for less and the ability to say you are only paying for what you use. There is no benefit to you for doing this the way you want.\n\n You obviously don't make too much money, you are seeing a whole different side to the US tax code.\n \n It is not currently run like a payment for general government services, it is currently a socialist engine growing on socialist premises.\n \n \nNo because contract law and the supreme court say so.\n\n Then they are wrong. You cannot agree to something except by agreeing to it. You must communicate your assent to the other party in explicit terms.\n \n \nA person can sue for anything doesn't mean they are right.\n\n You would be right to try to stop a company from violating rights.\n \n \nNo and yes. There are a number of ways to make an agreement\n\n Name another\n \n \nTrue but that isn't the case here.\n\n Prove it\n \n \nYour version has circumstances that might apply to a private company, but not government. It also has situations that there is no comparison. \n\n It is that attitude that is wrong. A government has no more rights and an individual and a company has no more rights than an individual.\n \nGovernment does not deport yo for not paying your taxes is one example.\n\n No, that is your proposed solution for someone who does not want to pay taxes.\n \n \nIt also is no longer relevant to the argument.\n\n Funny how that happened emoticon_cool\n \n \nSure but what I am saying is your actions put you in the agreement.\n\n I suspect you don't mean actions, you probably mean lack of action.\n \nThere is a process, very simple and not in the least bit difficult, to terminating that agreement. You have not terminated it until you do it correctly.\n\n There is no agreement to cancel, just as the coal miner didn't agree to go into the worst hell hole just by showing up at work.\n \n Until an agreement is reached there is no agreement by default.\n \n \nHe must be suing for kidnapping, enslavement and assault otherwise he could have quit when he was told to go work in the darkest hell hole. \n\n He is.\n \nI bet he is happy there is a disinterested third party that had established his ability to sue and would enforce anything they determined he was entitled to for the mining companies violation of laws that were also established by that third party.\n\n ah but there isn't, hes in the capitalist exploiters general court #4. The argument made by his employer just convinced the judge!\n \n \nBecause you understand it to be doesn't mean it is.\n\n I have told you why it is and you did not refute me.\n \n \nYou forgot, if we are to follow you examples, being unstable and ineffective at protecting its citizens and most likely collapsing.\n\n That is your personal opinion, it is mine that it would excel. Both are irrelevant though because practicality is not primary to morality and you should not support an immoral system merely because you think it might work better.\n \n \nBut yet everyday you remain one. \n\n I know.\n \n \nWhy would you think you would get any of the benefits of society by not participating in it?\n\n I don't think that.\n \nWhy would you be entitled to enjoy the efforts of others without obligation? \n\n I would not be.\n \nDoesn't that describe a parasite?\n\n Yes\n \n \nNot familiar with that. Doesn't happen with the US Government.\n\n Then you are delusional, it is called taxation. Oh yes I agree they don't have the right to the wealth but they act on the premise that they do.\n \n \nDo you pay only for what you use for your children, wife, mom or dad?\n\n No, taxes take whatever the government decides without my consent. I believe we went over this...\n \nWho would that check be made out to or do you have no moral responsibility to them?\n\n Right now to no one, that's another one the problems with the immorality inherent in the current system.\n \n Just so no one would owe any money to me because they use the roads or water lines.\n \n \ncommunitarianism, communism, socialism and maybe a few other isms that would be true to some extent, but not so in the US. You would have to establish every penny the government has ever had has been the result of theft. Which is impossible to do since it isn't the case.\n\n It is impossible to do but not because it is not stealing.\n \n I find it analogous to a criminal family who had been stealing generally from everyone for several generations.\n \n It would be impossible to find the owners of everything stolen without records but when the family finally got brought down the only thing you could do is generally distribute what they stole to those whom they stole from.\n \n If you give it to some one and they say \"no I really wanted to give them this\" then you say \"well they are a criminal organization and were not legal, so take your money and give it to a legal body\"\n \n \ninconvenient. It would be illogical to remain being violated if you could escape that violation.\n\n I cannot, the rest of the world has governments who either violate rights themselves or private entities which violate rights.\n \n \nThere is no defense the violation has already occurred. The arrest and detention is a separate event.\n\n So it's about revenge for you?\n \nAs you agreed it is not moral to steal from a thief. Arresting and punishing the perpetrator is retribution. If the kidnapper holds the victim for 5 days why is he in turn held 5, 10 maybe 20 years. Making all things equal the victim's cost was 5 days the perpetrators cost is 730 times that on a 10 year sentence or 3,645 days more. That isn't a violation of rights under your philosophy?\n\n It is not, why would you think it would be?\n \n \nHaving reason is not the same as having proof suffucient to prove guilt.\n\n True, beyond reasonable doubt does not mean that you have a reason, it means you have proof.\n \n Do not arrest or convict anyone without proof.\n \n Arresting someone on suspicion and finding out later it was someone else would be a violation of that person's rights.\n\n Correct.\n \nYour philosophy only supports beyond doubt.\n\n No it does not.\n \n \nWhich means \"Sir we would like to ask you some questions concerning a crime.\" Response \"I don't want to.\" \"ok have a nice day, goodbye.\"\n\n Yep\n \n \nYou can't ever prove their guilt if you can't compel them to show up in court to be tried.\n\n That is not true.\n \n For example, a camera catches a man killing another man.\n \n The police review it and positively identify the murderer.\n \n They have proven to themselves he is a murderer, they can arrest him.\n \n He goes into court where the video is shown, it is proven to the jurors that he is guilty.\n \n The only reason a trial exists is to verify that there is proof, you do not need a jury to prove someone is guilty, merely to do it before the law.\n \n You can't compel them to court because you can't prove their guillt.\n\n If you can't prove their guilt you do not have a right to compel them to court.\n \n our current system values form over fact and it is incorrect. There is no contradiction in behaving in accordance with the truth at all times.\n \n \nSome try all except for maybe some of the really dumb ones.\n\n I don't think it's that hard to find proof beyond reasonable doubt.\n \n For one it's all we have now so if you think most people would get off then they do now.\n \n Secondly if you are right too bad, it's much worse to send innocent people to jail.\n \n \nUnder your idea of rights it does without question and therefore law enforcement as we understand it cannot exist\n\n What right must a policeman violate to do his job?\n \n \nDon't you have to prove he did it to establish he violated rights?\n\n Yes, but the distinction is important because for a police force they do not need it to be proven to a jury.\n \n A crime does not become a crime only when the jury agrees it is, so the rights of the criminal are not only forfeited when it is proven that he is a criminal.\n \n It allows the situation where the police arrest someone and are wrong, in which case they are guilty of the violate of rights but they would not be if the person was guilty.\n \nDo you think they will ever find Ron Goldman and Denise Brown's murderer? Sometimes the guilty go free.\n\n Sometimes they do.\n \n \nThis would be the majority or society making the determination of what will happen to someone should they not follow the laws that the majority or society have established prior to any violation of rights.\n Imposing in some instances a penalty for transgressing th law but violating no person's rights.\n\n A moral man would never willingly submit to punishment if he did nothing wrong.\n \n \nWhen you say government does not have the right to take your property I assume you only refer to obligations you deem a violation of your rights. In the event there were some reason you believed valid you would not consider that a violation and pay it. \n\n In theory they are all violations because they are all demanded by threat of force.\n \n If there was a moral government I would pay for what I owe and not use what I do not pay for.\n \n \nSo what is your property? The fruits of your labor, but without society you have no labor nor do you have fruits from it.\n\n Prove it.\n \nThe idea that you have a an inalienable right to possess property is a product of society.\n\n It is not.\n \nAs a child you are incapable of making decisions, others must make them for you. In doing so they may violate your rights.\n\n You really are losing it.\n \nYou also said the state cannot act preemptively.\n\n When did I say that?\n \nSo grounding your child is a violation. If a 10 year old wants to leave home it is a violation of his rights to not let him. If he wants to drive a car he should be allowed to.\n\n So society is like the individuals parent? :xcensored",

   "I gain plenty from that, but my argument is about morality, and an \"all or nothing\" government funding is not inherently immoral.\n \n What is inherently immoral is stealing, no matter what system you choose to fund a government it may not morally violate rights and that is what I argue against.\n\n \n The government is not stealing from you, it is not extorting money from you. It is performing the functions it was designed to do and doing so within the law. What you refer to as being threatened if you don&#8217;t pay an arbitrary amount determined by the government only occurs after you have not fulfilled your obligation and as a part of the collection process\n \n \n \nWhat do you mean?\n\n \n A pay per use system would be significantly more expensive\n \n \nI wouldn't trade one open book price with another.\n\n \n Looks like you are to me\n \n \nThat's only if you are in debt, they cannot take your assets on the premise that you want to use their service if you do not actually use it.\n\n \n If you have an outstanding debt then they can attempt to collect it. This is doesn&#8217;t effect my statement in anyway though\n \n \nYou obviously don't make too much money, you are seeing a whole different side to the US tax code.\n It is not currently run like a payment for general government services, it is currently a socialist engine growing on socialist premises.\n\n \n Actually I am familiar with the tax code and you might be surprised at what I make, but none of this is really relevant to the point I was making. Taxes have been a means to influence public behavior for a long time and is rarely detrimental to the public with the exception of increases. I have a feeling your version of government would end up doing the same thing, just less effective.\n \n \nThen they are wrong. You cannot agree to something except by agreeing to it. You must communicate your assent to the other party in explicit terms.\n\n \n I am going to need something a little more credible than because as a rebuttal. Maybe contract law and the courts of the land are right and you are wrong. Your actions and the actions of government do in fact communicate acceptance. The continued performance of both as if the agreement was in effect and your refusal to terminate leave only one logical conclusion.\n \n \nName another\n\n \n Let me know if you need more\n \n Aleatory contract\n Freedom Contract\n Quasi contract\n Nudum Pactum\n Synallagamatic contract\n Implied contract\n Postal rule\n \n Legal definition of acceptance\n Acceptance need not always be direct and can, in certain circumstances, be implied by conduct (most notably by handshake, pictured).\n Further, the exact moment of acceptance may not always be readily discernible. That, for want of more, would not suffice in avoiding the terms of a contract where actions or other evidence of acceptance is present.\n In Krakana, Justice Thompson wrote:\n \"The whole transaction is to be looked at and an inquiry into the precise time at which the different parts of one transaction take place is unnecessary if in fact it can be determined from the whole that a single contract was intended and resulted.\" \n At \u00a72-204(2) of the United States Commercial Code:\n \"An agreement sufficient to constitute a contract for sale may be found even if the moment of its making is undetermined.\" \n \n Legal definition of acquiesce\n Action or inaction which binds a person legally even though it was not intended as such.\n Action which is not intended as a direct acceptance of a contract will nevertheless stand as such as it implies recognition of the terms of the contract.\n For example, if I display a basket of fruit in a marketplace and you come by, inspect an apple and then bite into it, you have acquiesced to the contract of sale of that apple.\n Acquiescence also refers to allowing too much time to pass since you had knowledge of an event which may have allowed you to have legal recourse against another, implying that you waive your rights to that legal recourse.\n \n \nIt is that attitude that is wrong. A government has no more rights and an individual and a company has no more rights than an individual.\n\n \n Wrong. Your cable company has rights you do not and you have some that it does not. It most likely has an easement on your property. You won&#8217;t get one on it&#8217;s property. It has the right to charge you and collect those charges. Government can enact laws, you can&#8217;t. \n \n \nNo, that is your proposed solution for someone who does not want to pay taxes.\n\n \n I was very clear on at least two separate occasions that failure to pay taxes does not result in deportation. So no that isn&#8217;t my position and never has been. You maybe deported for being here illegally, like when you renounce your citizenship.\n \n \nI suspect you don't mean actions, you probably mean lack of action.\n\n \n Actually both\n \n \nThere is no agreement to cancel, just as the coal miner didn't agree to go into the worst hell hole just by showing up at work.\n\n \n If there is no agreement (but there is) then you are not legally permitted to be within the US, are not able to legally work and the rights granted and protected by government are limited. \n \n \nThat is your personal opinion, it is mine that it would excel. Both are irrelevant though because practicality is not primary to morality and you should not support an immoral system merely because you think it might work better.\n\n \n Instead I should look at supporting an irrational government system, but that would make it wrong and being wrong is immoral. \n \n \n \nI know.\n\n \n Why then?\n \n \nI don't think that.\n \n I would not be.\n \n Yes\n\n \n you state it in posts.\n \n \nNo, taxes take whatever the government decides without my consent. I believe we went over this...\n\n \n That is an over simplification of the process. We have, but you are still stuck on believing you have not given consent to be taxed. You have not given consent the way you want to under the conditions you want to. That is different than you have not given consent.\n \n \nJust so no one would owe any money to me because they use the roads or water lines.\n\n \n Nobody would owe you for these things you don&#8217;t own them. Citizens get conditional use.\n \n \nIt is impossible to do but not because it is not stealing.\n\n \n Until you can show a valid reason that the law and courts are wrong it isn&#8217;t stealing.\n \n \nIf you give it to some one and they say \"no I really wanted to give them this\" then you say \"well they are a criminal organization and were not legal, so take your money and give it to a legal body\"\n\n \n Wow commit a crime and have just about every right stripped from you. Can&#8217;t even receive a gift. Why are you interfering with my property rights also? I should be able to give whatever I want to whoever I want. \n \n \nI cannot, the rest of the world has governments who either violate rights themselves or private entities which violate rights.\n\n \n Sounds like you have a bit of a dilemma. In order to stay here you have to agree to the conditions stipulated by society. You don&#8217;t have to accept. You can see if maybe you can work a deal with another country more to your liking, but when all is said and done Government has an obligation to those it governs before those it doesn&#8217;t.\n \n \nSo it's about revenge for you?\n\n \n Uumm this is the result of applying what you have said should happen. \n \n \nTrue, beyond reasonable doubt does not mean that you have a reason, it means you have proof.\n \n Do not arrest or convict anyone without proof.\n\n \n But again having proof does not necessarily mean sufficient to convict. Reasonable doubt is just an educated guess. \n \n Do not violate individuals rights. No Exceptions. Reasonable doubt can still be wrong and violate a right.\n \n \n \nFor example, a camera catches a man killing another man.\n \n The police review it and positively identify the murderer.\n \n They have proven to themselves he is a murderer, they can arrest him.\n\n \n Let&#8217;s say ok (doubtful, but ) the police are not the ones who determine guilt. Unless you plan on getting rid of innocent until proven guilty he is innocent until he appears in court and all the evidence is judged sufficient to convict. Only then is he considered guilty and subject to loss of his rights.\n \n \n \nHe goes into court where the video is shown, it is proven to the jurors that he is guilty.\n \n The only reason a trial exists is to verify that there is proof, you do not need a jury to prove someone is guilty, merely to do it before the law.\n\n \n So much for the right to trial by a jury of peers. Court doesn&#8217;t simply verify the police have proof. The police most likely will not have access to his defense nor would have motivation to gather evidence for it. The intent is for a fair trial by impartial people. They will decide if there is sufficient evidence to convict.\n \n \n \nIf you can't prove their guilt you do not have a right to compel them to court.\n\n \n And only in court can you establish guilt\n \n \n \nI don't think it's that hard to find proof beyond reasonable doubt.\n\n \n Under your version yes it will be. If witnesses do not wish to testify, they cannot be made to, nor can they be made to answer every question honestly. No search warrants, no physical evidence except without the owners permission, no biological evidence without consent, no appearance by defendant and no beyond reasonable doubt. \n \n \n \nFor one it's all we have now so if you think most people would get off then they do now.\n\n \n No your version is far more restrictive.\n \n \nYes, but the distinction is important because for a police force they do not need it to be proven to a jury.\n\n \n Currently they only need probable cause. No exceptions would not accept a maybe or probably.\n \n \nA crime does not become a crime only when the jury agrees it is, so the rights of the criminal are not only forfeited when it is proven that he is a criminal.\n\n \n Then he is guilty and must prove he is innocent. Out legal system works the other way around. If he is innocent until proven guilty you must afford him his rights as if he had not been accused.\n \n \nIt allows the situation where the police arrest someone and are wrong, in which case they are guilty of the violate of rights but they would not be if the person was guilty.\n\n \n There goes the motivation for police to go after criminals who they lack rock solid evidence for. Why risk themselves if they are handicapped as much as they would be?.\n \n \nA moral man would never willingly submit to punishment if he did nothing wrong.\n\n \n Unless there was a worthwhile reason. This seems very similar to another situation where the majority got together to establish a set of rules that would effect everybody. Even those who were not yet born. By whose authority was law established and why is it applicable to those who never gave their consent to it?\n \n \n \nIn theory they are all violations because they are all demanded by threat of force.\n\n \n No the threat comes only after payment is withheld while trying to collect \n \n \nIf there was a moral government I would pay for what I owe and not use what I do not pay for.\n\n \n That is not what makes it moral or immoral. The morality isn&#8217;t relevant to how the government accepts given resources. Take the unnecessary morality from the statement and it is what you want and nothing else. Besides you will need to show that doing so would be a rational choice.\n \n \nProve it.\n\n \n If there was no society who would pay you? Who would you sell to or trade with? What would be the point? If there was no society how would you know how to do anything ? Where would you find the time?\n \n \n \nYou really are losing it.\n\n \n Put out some of the fires raging through your statements and maybe I might be, but when you offer because you said so as evidence I lean towards you&#8217;re the one losing it.\n \n \nSo society is like the individuals parent? :xcensored\n\n \n No it&#8217;s another hole in your sinking rights may not be violated no exceptions and your version would excel concept. Unless you have a thing for Lord of the Flies",

   "The government is not stealing from you\n\n I have said it a thousand times but it is not hard to type so: Prove it.\n \nit is not extorting money from you.\n\n I know, why do you contradict yourself? You just said the government was not stealing from me.\n \n Extort is a flavor of meaning but its core definition is a subclass of theft, which is to take without permission or by force.\n \n \nIt is performing the functions it was designed to do and doing so within the law.\n\n Why do you think that should matter?\n \nWhat you refer to as being threatened if you don't pay an arbitrary amount determined by the government only occurs after you have not fulfilled your obligation and as a part of the collection process\n\n Obligations are the result only of agreements. The premise of universal liberty states that no man has inherent duties; that his/her life ought to be totally free of coercion and force by others.\n \n \nA pay per use system would be significantly more expensive\n\n I disagree, what is the relevance?\n \n \n \nLooks like you are to me\n\n Then you don't know what I'm saying.\n \n \n \nIf you have an outstanding debt then they can attempt to collect it. This is doesn't affect my statement in anyway though\n\n It didn't affect your statement no, it did show that your statement didn't have any effect on my argument in anyway though.\n \n \n \nActually I am familiar with the tax code\n\n Then explain to me how a poor man causes less wear on the roads than a middle class man? Or how a rich man could \"pay\" for the services of 20 poor men with his taxes while receiving the same services as them?\n \n Is this a system of payment for services or an implementation of Marxist principles?\n \n Finally what makes you think it matters to my argument; you have tried hard to make this about \"what I want to pay\" and what \"I think is fair\" because that is precisely where you want it to be.\n \n You know that if you can get me to agree to the premise of taxation by showing that I don't like its particular form now but I might agree to it if it was a flat tax or a \"fair tax\" or lower taxes; that I would have contradicted myself by implying there was a moral form of taxation.\n \n I will not agree, it is not the unfairness, the socialism, the inefficiency, the corruption that makes taxes wrong.\n \n Just as jealousy, hatred, vengeance may all cause a murder; murder is not wrong because the murderer was any one of those things.\n \n Taxation is wrong specifically because it is identical to theft and therefore a violation of rights.\n \n No matter how equitable or fair a king is, he does not have the right to violate rights, and no matter how well constructed or reasonable a tax is you may never collect it without permission and remain in the right.\n \n So long as the definition of taxation is the taking with or without permission it is wrong.\n \n Therefore it does not matter that you think a moral government would be more expensive than this one.\n \n \nand you might be surprised at what I make\n\n The higher above what I'm guessing the more blind that would make you.\n \nbut none of this is really relevant to the point I was making.\n\n I would like you to repeat that point for me because it appears to be an appeal to impracticality on a moral issue.\n \nTaxes have been a means to influence public behavior for a long time and is rarely detrimental to the public with the exception of increases.\n\n You depart from your democratic premise here. I have often referred to the government as something other than the public and you have said the government is just doing the will of the public.\n \n Yet here you treat government as its own will with its own goal of influencing the public.\n \n Have taxes been used by the public to influence itself?\n \n Here is where this abstraction fails to be useful. Taxes have long been used by the majority to influence the minority.\n \n \nI have a feeling your version of government would end up doing the same thing, just less effective.\n\n My version of government is incapable of levying taxes, making it very hard to do so to influence the public.\n \n \nI am going to need something a little more credible than because as a rebuttal.\n\n Which is why I included the statements that would cause the conclusion to be true.....\n \n Do you disagree with premises of the rebuttal?\n \nMaybe contract law and the courts of the land are right and you are wrong.\n\n That would require a different set of facts, in this case a different set of definitions for several words, or you could just reverse the definition of right and wrong.\n \n \nYour actions and the actions of government do in fact communicate acceptance.\n\n Prove it.\n \nThe continued performance of both as if the agreement was in effect and your refusal to terminate leave only one logical conclusion.\n\n There is no agreement, I need not terminate a non-existent agreement.\n \n The only logical conclusion is that the government is the only one proceeding as if there is an agreement.\n \n If you are captured in war and someone sees you being led to the POW camp, do they assume that since you are walking the way the enemy soldiers are telling you to walk you agreed to go to the camp?\n \n The only agreement that exists there is \"do what I say and I won't shoot you\" just as the only agreement between me and the government is \"I'll do what you say if you don't imprison or deport me.\"\n \n Coercion is not a contract, and it is perfectly logical to avoid negative consequences.\n \n I do not agree that the government is behaving morally by submitting to its military power any more than a Jew agrees the Nazis were moral by not traveling to Germany.\n \n \nLet me know if you need more\n\n It was a rhetorical question as any answer would be self-contradictory, but since you found some terms I will give you enough rope to hang yourself; in which of these does an agreement form without terms being presented and accepted by both parties?\n \n Aleatory contract - Type of contract (1) whose execution or performance depends on a contingency or an uncertain (random) event beyond the control of either party, and/or (2) under which the sums paid by the parties to each other are unequal. Most insurance policies are aleatory contracts because the insured may collect a large amount or nothing in return for the premiums paid. From French 'alea,' a game of dice. See also unilateral contract.\n \n Nope not there.\n \n Freedom Contract\n \n Can't find a definition for that.\n \n Quasi contract  - Court's determination of an obligation of one party to another where no actual contract exists. It is based on the parties' conduct, mutual relationship, and/or on the possibility that one would be unjustly enriched at the expense of the other. In strict legal terms a quasi contract does not constitute a formal contract, but is a legal remedy that allows a plaintiff to recover an award or benefit conferred on the defendant.\n A non-formal contract is still a contract. If there was no agreement than this should not apply.\n \n i.e. just because a court thinks an agreement was implied does not mean it existed. (sound familiar?)\n \n Nudum Pactum - Agreement without a consideration, hence just a promise. Naked agreements (unless made by a deed) are not binding in law, and are called 'nudum pactum' (Latin for, naked contract) governed by the legal maxim 'ex nudo pacto non oritur actio' (a right of action does not arise from a naked contract). Also called naked agreement.\n Agreement without a consideration = an Agreement?\n \n Yes, next!\n \n Synallagamatic contract - Bilateral or reciprocal contract in which both parties provide consideration and have mutual rights and obligations. A sale, for example, is a synallagmatic contract while a gift is not.\n \n Which appears to be the inverse of nudum pactum, but not an agreement forming without terms and acceptance.\n \n Implied contract - Legally enforceable agreement that arises from the conduct, assumed intentions, some relationship among the immediate parties, or due to the application of the legal principle of equity. For example, a contract is implied when a party knowingly accepts a benefit from another party in circumstances where the benefit cannot be considered a gift. Therefore, the party accepting the benefit is under a legal obligation to give fair value for the benefit received.\n This is probably the one you wanted, notice the word accept and fair value :)\n \n In any case I do not believe implied contracts exist in so far as their definition is the failure to agree upon terms.\n \n Without terms there is no standard to a contract making it a legal nicety produced by persons having trouble analyzing the morality of a few situations.\n \n What is fair value? The seller can't set it post fact, nor can the buyer decide it is nothing.\n \n What is knowingly accepts? A person who uses something that is not his is doing so without explicit permission and so has no guaranteed right to it.\n \n For all he knows it could be stealing, which means this could only apply if he knew it was meant to be used by someone such as himself, which would mean that somehow the seller communicated that a contract was being offered for the use of an object.\n \n The seller's inability to provide terms of sale does not equal his right to decide them after the fact.\n \n He has two choices: claim the user was stealing, offer the user terms that he may or may not accept morally.\n \n The government cannot claim I am stealing, I am recovering stolen goods, and the terms I will accept are paying for the exact cost of what I use with no profit margin.\n \n Postal rule\n Is not missing explcit acceptance.\n \n \nAcceptance need not always be direct and can, in certain circumstances, be implied by conduct (most notably by handshake, pictured).\n Further, the exact moment of acceptance may not always be readily discernible. That, for want of more, would not suffice in avoiding the terms of a contract where actions or other evidence of acceptance is present.\n In Krakana, Justice Thompson wrote:\n \"The whole transaction is to be looked at and an inquiry into the precise time at which the different parts of one transaction take place is unnecessary if in fact it can be determined from the whole that a single contract was intended and resulted.\" \n\n Fair enough.\n \n \nFor example, if I display a basket of fruit in a marketplace and you come by, inspect an apple and then bite into it, you have acquiesced to the contract of sale of that apple.\n\n For example, if a thief steals $200 from you and then places a basket of fruit on a marketplace table and you happen by, recognize him, and demand your money back. He says he spent it on the fruit, you then pick up the fruit and leave.\n \n This is an example of recovering stolen goods when the sale implied or express of anything you stole is not your right, firmly removing any entitlement you have to any contract on those lines.\n \n \nAcquiescence also refers to allowing too much time to pass since you had knowledge of an event which may have allowed you to have legal recourse against another, implying that you waive your rights to that legal recourse.\n\n There is no legal recourse.\n \n \n \nWrong. Your cable company has rights you do not and you have some that it does not.\n\n Wrong all individuals have the same rights and all organizations or groups of individuals have the same rights as their members.\n \n \nI was very clear on at least two separate occasions that failure to pay taxes does not result in deportation. So no that isn't my position and never has been. \n\n It does not, it results in imprisonment and further theft.\n \n You did say to me that if I did not want to pay taxes I should leave.\n \n \nActually both\n\n No contract can be implied by lack of action.\n \n \nIf there is no agreement (but there is) then you are not legally permitted to be within the US\n\n I have told you already I care nothing for laws which no one has the right to write.\n \n \nInstead I should look at supporting an irrational government system \n\n If you can prove that a government based of morality is irrational then you will have proved morality is irrational. Good luck emoticon_xgood\n \n Practical in a vacuum does not equal rational, a war hero will enter a battle field and die there for his freedom and the freedom of his friends, family, and country. That act would be totally impractical to the purpose of staying alive and totally practical to the purpose of being a human being. He remains rational at his funeral.\n \n \nWhy then?\n\n Because the government has declared it so. I do not have the right to reject what I was not given the right to accept.\n \n \nyou state it in posts.\n\n Show me.\n \n \nThat is an over simplification of the process.\n\n Yet accurate.\n \nWe have\n\n \"we\" who is \"we\"? and what have you done?\n \nbut you are still stuck on believing you have not given consent to be taxed.\n\n Of course I still believe I have not given consent, you've tried to move on given this premise several times. Has someone else you know given these arguments and quickly surrendered on that point?\n \n What makes you think I will ever be convinced that I have given consent even though I say I have not and you can't point out anything that could be rationally construed as giving consent.\n \n \nYou have not given consent the way you want to under the conditions you want to. That is different than you have not given consent.\n\n I have not given consent at all.\n \n My birth and existence is not consent.\n \n I could give you notice now that unless you go and live where I tell you to live or do what I tell you to do that would be 'implied' consent to my dictator ship but that would not mean that it was so.\n \n I do not have the right to offer you that choice and so: your failure to submit to my dictatorship before this so called 'implied' consent to that very thing.\n \n Circular logic = The government has a right to tell you what the conditions of your life are based on where you live because you consent to it -< you consent to it because of where you live -< since you consent to it the government has the right to tell you what the conditions of your life are.\n \n The presumption that the government has the right to give me an ultimatum of this nature confuses you but not me.\n \n \nNobody would owe you for these things you don't own them.\n\n Very good now integrate the concept.\n \n \nUntil you can show a valid reason that the law and courts are wrong it isn't stealing.\n\n Unless you can show a valid reason why the courts can alter the definition of a word it is.\n \n The courts or congress may declare they have a right to take without permission of by force, but an unfounded assertion is itself whether it be made by a drugged mystic or albert Einstein. The only difference is authority.\n \n Morality does not change with the circumstances, The courts need to justify their decisions before I agree they are right; and nothing can justify a self-contradictory statement such as the one made in the paragraph right before this.\n \n \nWow commit a crime and have just about every right stripped from you. Can't even receive a gift.\n\n Just the ones you forfeited.\n \n If you stole everything you have you have no right to anything you have.\n \nWhy are you interfering with my property rights also?\n\n I am not, if you give your money to a criminal organization that does not mean it is any less criminal. You can't claim that because you donated $5 to a $5000 dollar project and the rest was stolen that the project belongs to the organization you donated to.\n \n You wasted your money.\n \n I should be able to give whatever I want to whoever I want. \n\n Certainly, but if you are giving your taxes as a gift they are not yours anymore.\n \n The government has your money and can only morally use what money that was given in this way.\n \n Unless you claim to be able to discern exactly what was done with whose money you cannot claim the government owns it.\n \n \n \nSounds like you have a bit of a dilemma.\n\n If by dilemma you mean contradiction I do not, if by dilemma you mean a problem then yes.\n \nIn order to stay here you have to agree to the conditions stipulated by society. You don't have to accept. You can see if maybe you can work a deal with another country more to your liking, but when all is said and done Government has an obligation to those it governs before those it doesn't.\n\n I don't understand your point.\n \n \n \nUumm this is the result of applying what you have said should happen. \n\n Which part of it?\n \n \n \nBut again having proof does not necessarily mean sufficient to convict. Reasonable doubt is just an educated guess. \n\n You posted legal terms here already, perhaps you should look up the definition of reasonable doubt.\n \n Proof is sufficient to convict.\n \nDo not violate individuals rights. No Exceptions. \n\n I smile when you say that, you don't know what it means but it is still good.\n \nReasonable doubt can still be wrong and violate a right.\n\n The risk of violating a right is not equal to violating a right.\n \n By this logic sending fishermen out to fish is equivalent to murder because there is a risk they will encounter a storm that will destroy them.\n \n \nLet's say ok (doubtful, but ) the police are not the ones who determine guilt. Unless you plan on getting rid of innocent until proven guilty he is innocent until he appears in court and all the evidence is judged sufficient to convict.\n\n He is innocent until proven guilty, not innocent until proven in court to be guilty.\n \n Your own logic would destroy current criminal justice but not mine.\n \n If a man is innocent until he is proven guilty before a court then he is innocent when his home is searched, when he is arrested, when he is interrogated.\n \n You live in a world where every single search warrant, every arrest, every questioning is wrong.\n \n It does not matter to you, you already believe rights must be violated for the sake of society.\n \n I work on a different premise one far more rational.\n \n A man is innocent until he is proven guilty. Science makes no room for personal authority and neither does morality.\n \n A court is not required to commit a crime nor to be guilty of it.\n \nOnly then is he considered guilty and subject to loss of his rights.\n\n As far as the law is concerned, if a prosecutor does not believe someone is guilty beyond reasonable doubt he should not try to put him in jail.\n \n He did not wait for the court case to make that decision and he should not.\n \n To me the time between arrest and proof before the law of guilt is the trust given to the police nothing more.\n \n It is trusted that the police do not arrest people without proof of guilt, if they do they are wrong and they have violated a right, if they did not they have not violated a right.\n \n The courts are a security system, a check and balance of the justice system.\n \n Just like the rest of government they should be based on the principles of morality but do not make them.\n \n \nSo much for the right to trial by a jury of peers.\n\n What of it? It is an excellent right to provide to citizens.\n \nCourt doesn't simply verify the police have proof.\n\n That is what they ought to do.\n \nThe police most likely will not have access to his defense nor would have motivation to gather evidence for it.\n\n and?\n \nThe intent is for a fair trial by impartial people.\n\n Yes.....\n \nThey will decide if there is sufficient evidence to convict.\n\n Aye\n \n \nAnd only in court can you establish guilt\n\n Why?\n \n \nUnder your version yes it will be.\n\n I disagree but if you were right we would just have to live with it.\n \n\n No your version is far more restrictive.\n\n In the powers the police have to gather evidence perhaps not in the standard of proof.\n \nCurrently they only need probable cause. No exceptions would not accept a maybe or probably.\n\n No exceptions would allow no exceptions, not the risk of no exceptions.\n \n I believe probable cause is good reason for a search warrant.\n \n What we disagree on is the case if the subject is innocent, you think that everything would be fine and dandy while I say that rights were violated.\n \n Yes the police cannot violate rights and be immune to the consequences just because their job is to find criminals. If so they need not look any farther than the mirror.\n \n \nThen he is guilty and must prove he is innocent.\n\n Why?\n \nIf he is innocent until proven guilty you must afford him his rights as if he had not been accused.\n\n Yes, the proof before the law takes place at court, proof before the police takes place when they decide to arrest someone.\n \n \n \n \nThere goes the motivation for police to go after criminals who they lack rock solid evidence for. Why risk themselves if they are handicapped as much as they would be?\n\n If you don't think any policeman would take the risk of violating the rights of an innocent man that may be the truth, we may be limited to convicting only those for whom guilt can be proven via normal investigation.\n \n What would give you the right to empower men with the ability to violate rights when you would not be willing to do the same if you had to face the consequences?\n \n \nUnless there was a worthwhile reason.\n\n There is no worthwhile reason. If he is forced it is not willingly, if he is bribed it is immoral (betraying the truth).\n \nThis seems very similar to another situation where the majority got together to establish a set of rules that would affect everybody. Even those who were not yet born.\n\n Really how?\n \n By whose authority was law established and why is it applicable to those who never gave their consent to it?\n\n It is anyone's authority to recognize what morality is and call it law, morality is applicable to all humans because it is a fact, the law is not.\n \n \nNo the threat comes only after payment is withheld while trying to collect \n\n and what does it matter whether the threat comes before or after the demand?\n \n \nThat is not what makes it moral or immoral.\n\n What is that?\n \nThe morality isn't relevant to how the government accepts given resources.\n\n Of course not, it's whether it steals them.\n \nTake the unnecessary morality from the statement and it is what you want and nothing else.\n\n What unnecessary morality? I said if there was a moral government I would pay for what I use and nothing more.\n \n The only other option is an immoral government such as the one we have now, in which I do not have a choice.\n \n I am merely telling you what I would do given the choice that is mine by right but not by judgment.\n \nBesides you will need to show that doing so would be a rational choice.\n\n You wouldn't sign an unlimited contract with a private company and I would not do so with any company.\n \n \nIf there was no society who would pay you?\n\n Currency would be unnecessary.\n \nWho would you sell to or trade with?\n\n That would be impossible.\n \nWhat would be the point? \n\n Of?\n \nIf there was no society how would you know how to do anything ?\n\n I would have to discover it myself if I could.\n \n Where would you find the time?\n\n It seems to become available at a constant rate.\n \n What do these things have to do with the burden of proof I asked of you?\n \n \nPut out some of the fires raging through your statements and maybe I might be,\n\n emoticon_cool\n \nbut when you offer because you said so as evidence I lean towards you're the one losing it.\n\n I have used premises and conclusions, you have challenged some premises and not challenged others.\n \n I have never offered \"because I said so\" as a premise for any conclusion.\n \n \nNo it's another hole in your sinking rights may not be violated no exceptions and your version would excel concept.\n\n I have no idea what you mean.",

   "I have said it a thousand times but it is not hard to type so: Prove it.\n\n \n I have.\n \n \nExtort is a flavor of meaning but its core definition is a subclass of theft, which is to take without permission or by force.\n\n \n Extort is the correct word for your premise. Theft is slightly vague to the particulars.\n \n \nWhy do you think that should matter?\n\n \n The government having the legal right to impose a tax on the population under its jurisdiction as well as the authority to collect that tax leaves your position very weak. \n \n \nObligations are the result only of agreements. The premise of universal liberty states that no man has inherent duties; that his/her life ought to be totally free of coercion and force by others.\n\n \n The premise of universal liberty? Not ringing a bell, I have a feeling though it won't stand up against the real world. Sounds like its an ought to type philosophy, and boom just as I type it there is the word of the day. There are a lot of ought to's in the world, they are much like wants.\n \n \nI disagree, what is the relevance?\n\n \n You would be wrong. Your theory defeats itself in that your system would increase the costs of government, reduce the benefits, cause instability, disorder and diminish the rule of law to almost meaningless. No rational person would trade the current system for a much worse system. That would make it a wrong choice and immoral.\n \n \nThen you don't know what I'm saying.\n\n \n I may not be the only one\n \n \nThen explain to me how a poor man causes less wear on the roads than a middle class man? \n\n \n Does he? \n \n \nOr how a rich man could \"pay\" for the services of 20 poor men with his taxes while receiving the same services as them?\n\n \n \n Capitalism. Perhaps he has the greater need. There could be a number of ways to explain this but I don't really see what it has to do this.\n \n \nIs this a system of payment for services or an implementation of Marxist principles?\n\n \n Niether\n \n \nFinally what makes you think it matters to my argument; you have tried hard to make this about \"what I want to pay\" and what \"I think is fair\" because that is precisely where you want it to be.\n\n \n Not precisely and not for the reasons you seem to think.\n \n \nYou know that if you can get me to agree to the premise of taxation by showing that I don't like its particular form now but I might agree to it if it was a flat tax or a \"fair tax\" or lower taxes; that I would have contradicted myself by implying there was a moral form of taxation.\n \n I will not agree, it is not the unfairness, the socialism, the inefficiency, the corruption that makes taxes wrong.\n\n \n \n You already have. What would you call that voluntary tax system you keep on bring up. Whichever way makes you feel good about it, but at the end of the day government is being provided money by those it is governing to support it's efforts to govern. You don't like it when they say this is what you owe, but are happy to when it's this is what I will pay. Other than the method acquired their is no difference.\n \n \nJust as jealousy, hatred, vengeance may all cause a murder; murder is not wrong because the murderer was any one of those things.\n\n \n What it's right because of one of those things? \n \n \nTaxation is wrong specifically because it is identical to theft and therefore a violation of rights.\n\n \n No it is not. When do you plan on proving this? The government has the legal right to impose a tax. As long as you remain under the jurisdiction of the US and remain in this society you have an obligation to obey the laws in force. \n \n You may have certain inalienable rights, but the right to not pay taxes while living within the US while earning an income is not one of them. \n \n Once more to remain and participate within society all the while acting as if you have accepted the obligation while enjoying the benefits can only be considered your agreemnt to the conditions of being a citizen. \n \n The problem of choices to your liking being unavailable is your problem. You do not have the right to have things your way because life ought to be that way. \n \n \n \nNo matter how equitable or fair a king is, he does not have the right to violate rights, and no matter how well constructed or reasonable a tax is you may never collect it without permission and remain in the right.\n\n \n Yes you can. When one is liable for its obligations, the law provides for a means that permits collection with or without consent at the time of enforcement. This being moral even by your standards since the person who owes has violated the rights of the person owed. \n \n \n \nSo long as the definition of taxation is the taking with or without permission it is wrong.\n\n \n No it is not. It is ridiculous for you say it is even with permission as that is part of your system. You still have yet to give a reasonable argument why collecting a debt is immoral.\n \n \nTherefore it does not matter that you think a moral government would be more expensive than this one.\n\n \n I don't think your version will be more expensive. I know it will be and moral will not be one of the things it is.\n \n \nThe higher above what I'm guessing the more blind that would make you.\n\n \n Very nice.\n \n \nYou depart from your democratic premise here. I have often referred to the government as something other than the public and you have said the government is just doing the will of the public.\n \n Yet here you treat government as its own will with its own goal of influencing the public.\n\n \n Heaven forbid. It is possible to be both depending on the circumstances and what is hoped to be achieved.\n \n \nHave taxes been used by the public to influence itself?\n\n \n It could be viewed that way. Indirectly yes.\n \n \nHere is where this abstraction fails to be useful. Taxes have long been used by the majority to influence the minority.\n\n \n Sure about as often as it is used by the minority to influence the majority. I missed whatever point you wanted to make with that.\n \n \nMy version of government is incapable of levying taxes, making it very hard to do so to influence the public.\n\n \n Your version of geovernment is incapable of a lot of things. I would be more interested in what it might be capable of doing.\n \n \nWhich is why I included the statements that would cause the conclusion to be true.....\n \n Do you disagree with premises of the rebuttal?\n\n \n No you didn't. You were wrong. Explicit acknowledgment and consent are not the only means of making a valid agreement and saying that contract law and our court system are wrong because you are right of course I disagree with that.\n \n \nThat would require a different set of facts, in this case a different set of definitions for several words, or you could just reverse the definition of right and wrong.\n\n \n Seriously? I can't wait to hear this.\n \n \nProve it.\n\n \n Already have, you didn't like it because you have a different opinion. That seems to be the major obstacle here is whether you like or dislike something.\n \n \nThere is no agreement, I need not terminate a non-existent agreement.\n\n \n As I have clearly shown there is. \n \n \nThe only logical conclusion is that the government is the only one proceeding as if there is an agreement.\n \n\n \n Which by your admission shows that a reasonable person would come to the conclusion that there was in fact a party that was not acting arbitrarily. The fact you will recognize an agreement being acted out by government shows that it is there. So you are aware of it, but did you give consent? Yes you did. By doing nothing to cause a reasonable person to think you did not wish to be a party to the agreement, by not informing the government that you did not wish to be a party to the agreement, by utilizing the benefits provided by the agreement and by accepting the benefits of the agreement you have created a legally binding agreement. Terms and conditions are explained in The constitution, The Bill of Rights and various other legal documents prepared over the centuries the US government has been around. \n \n \nIf you are captured in war and someone sees you being led to the POW camp, do they assume that since you are walking the way the enemy soldiers are telling you to walk you agreed to go to the camp?\n\n \n Unlike the POW you may get up and leave at anytime you desire or you can earn less than the minimum that would trigger a tax obligation. See you can stay and not have to pay taxes. Either way you have a choice. What prevents you is you don't like the alternatives. \n \n \nThe only agreement that exists there is \"do what I say and I won't shoot you\" just as the only agreement between me and the government is \"I'll do what you say if you don't imprison or deport me.\"\n\n \n see above for why this is wrong. Voluntarily leaving is not deportation and prison is a repercussion for not fulfilling your obligation. It is if you do not do what you are obligated to do then something will happen as a result. If you jump in the pool you will get wet. If you don't pay your taxes you will go to prison. If yo pay your taxes you will not go to prison. If you don't jump in the pool you will not get wet. \n \n \nCoercion is not a contract, and it is perfectly logical to avoid negative consequences.\n\n \n Coercion can be justified in some cases and can be a part of a valid agreement. \n \n It is logical and it is also logical to in some situations to give up certain freedoms to insure others will be protected.\n \n \nI do not agree that the government is behaving morally by submitting to its military power any more than a Jew agrees the Nazis were moral by not traveling to Germany.\n\n \n That is a nice opinion. \n \n \nIt was a rhetorical question as any answer would be self-contradictory, but since you found some terms I will give you enough rope to hang yourself; in which of these does an agreement form without terms being presented and accepted by both parties?\n \n\n \n Quote:\n Then they are wrong. You cannot agree to something except by agreeing to it. You must communicate your assent to the other party in explicit terms.\n \n I am going to need something a little more credible than because as a rebuttal. Maybe contract law and the courts of the land are right and you are wrong. Your actions and the actions of government do in fact communicate acceptance. The continued performance of both as if the agreement was in effect and your refusal to terminate leave only one logical conclusion.\n \n Quote:\n Name another \n\n \n This is rhetorical? \n \n You made a statement which I showed to be incorrect. A valid agreement need not be communicated explicitly by one party to another. Now you wish to discredit that by applying further stipulations. You would have been better of letting it go. Let's see who swings by the neck and who doesn't.\n \n \n \nAleatory contract - Type of contract (1) whose execution or performance depends on a contingency or an uncertain (random) event beyond the control of either party, and/or (2) under which the sums paid by the parties to each other are unequal. Most insurance policies are aleatory contracts because the insured may collect a large amount or nothing in return for the premiums paid. From French 'alea,' a game of dice. See also unilateral contract.\n \n Nope not there.\n\n \n Would your birth not be considered a random event beyond the control of either party? You argue the exchange is an unfair one. Maybe it doesn't fit your second set of conditions, but it did the first and arguably the second.\n \n \nQuasi contract  - Court's determination of an obligation of one party to another where no actual contract exists. It is based on the parties' conduct, mutual relationship, and/or on the possibility that one would be unjustly enriched at the expense of the other. In strict legal terms a quasi contract does not constitute a formal contract, but is a legal remedy that allows a plaintiff to recover an award or benefit conferred on the defendant.\n A non-formal contract is still a contract. If there was no agreement than this should not apply.\n\n \n \n Again in response to your original statement this along with an implied in fact contract show you were incorrect. \n \n This would cause the agreement to be formed if it didn't exist.\n \n \ni.e. just because a court thinks an agreement was implied does not mean it existed. (sound familiar?)\n\n \n No if a court says it exists then it pretty much does.\n \n \nSynallagamatic contract - Bilateral or reciprocal contract in which both parties provide consideration and have mutual rights and obligations. A sale, for example, is a synallagmatic contract while a gift is not.\n \n Which appears to be the inverse of nudum pactum, but not an agreement forming without terms and acceptance.\n\n \n Again you are wrong. Terms, conditions and acceptance are known and understood by all parties.\n \n \nImplied contract - Legally enforceable agreement that arises from the conduct, assumed intentions, some relationship among the immediate parties, or due to the application of the legal principle of equity. For example, a contract is implied when a party knowingly accepts a benefit from another party in circumstances where the benefit cannot be considered a gift. Therefore, the party accepting the benefit is under a legal obligation to give fair value for the benefit received.\n This is probably the one you wanted, notice the word accept and fair value :)\n\n \n \nIn any case I do not believe implied contracts exist in so far as their definition is the failure to agree upon terms.\n \n Without terms there is no standard to a contract making it a legal nicety produced by persons having trouble analyzing the morality of a few situations.\n\n \n \nWhat is fair value? The seller can't set it post fact, nor can the buyer decide it is nothing.\n\n \n You must not deal with contracts or business agreements much. Circumstances exist were both are valid. If value fluctuates or is unknown at the time of the agreement it can be stipulated to be determined at a later date. Their maybe a problem with performance and the buyer has recourse against his liability in the agreement. \n \n These are non-issues though with regards to this discussion.\n \n \nWhat is knowingly accepts? A person who uses something that is not his is doing so without explicit permission and so has no guaranteed right to it.\n\n \n You already agreed what the definition of acceptance is. So he has no guaranteed right to it. You go to a restaurant without reservations and you may have to wait, but they still seat you.\n \n \nFor all he knows it could be stealing, which means this could only apply if he knew it was meant to be used by someone such as himself, which would mean that somehow the seller communicated that a contract was being offered for the use of an object.\n\n \n But this isn't the case in this debate and when you go to the woods or beach or a park there is no explicit granting of it use, but you do so.\n \n \nThe seller's inability to provide terms of sale does not equal his right to decide them after the fact.\n\n \n The seller has not been unable and it can if the buyer proceeds anyway.\n \n \nHe has two choices: claim the user was stealing, offer the user terms that he may or may not accept morally.\n \n\n \n Why would he need to say the user was stealing. All he needs do is show there was use. The buyer would be morally obligated to offer compensation.\n \n \nThe government cannot claim I am stealing, I am recovering stolen goods, and the terms I will accept are paying for the exact cost of what I use with no profit margin.\n\n \n The government doesn't and doesn't need to claim you are stealing. You are not recovering stolen goods, that is a weak argument under any set of circumstances. Can you prove what is yours from someone else's? Can you establish the exact amount you think was stolen less any amount you would be liable for or not entitled to for any reason? As described you would be breaking the law. A wrong choice and immoral. Two wrongs do not make a right.\n \n \nFor example, if a thief steals $200 from you and then places a basket of fruit on a marketplace table and you happen by, recognize him, and demand your money back. He says he spent it on the fruit, you then pick up the fruit and leave.\n\n \n For which you might be subject to arrest and/or may have to return the fruit if he has claims against him that are superior to yours.\n \n \nThis is an example of recovering stolen goods when the sale implied or express of anything you stole is not your right, firmly removing any entitlement you have to any contract on those lines.\n\n \n No it is an example of being a vigilante. The agreement between you and government is not based on anything that can or has been stolen. The rights of government and your obligations are not tangible and even if you were correct that would not void the agreement.\n \n \nWrong all individuals have the same rights and all organizations or groups of individuals have the same rights as their members.\n\n \n Not all although maybe they should, but then again there is usually a good reason they don't.\n \n \nIt does not, it results in imprisonment and further theft.\n\n \n Then why say it? Breaking the law results in imprisonment. You have yet to prove there was theft to begin with, what further theft could there be?\n \n \nYou did say to me that if I did not want to pay taxes I should leave.\n\n \n That would be voluntary and not deportation",

   "No contract can be implied by lack of action.\n\n \n Sure can. Your failure to terminate can cause it to continue under different terms as an example.\n \n \nI have told you already I care nothing for laws which no one has the right to write.\n\n \n That is a nice opinion, but your personal dislike is noted, but makes no difference to the discussion.\n \n \nIf you can prove that a government based of morality is irrational then you will have proved morality is irrational. Good luck emoticon_xgood\n\n \n No not really. Your version has been shown to be irrational in it's described form as well as unrealistic in what it would hope to be.\n \n \nPractical in a vacuum does not equal rational, a war hero will enter a battle field and die there for his freedom and the freedom of his friends, family, and country. That act would be totally impractical to the purpose of staying alive and totally practical to the purpose of being a human being. He remains rational at his funeral.\n\n \n The hero does not wake up thinking today I will die so there can be freedom. His death will not cause freedom where it does not exist. He may for his ideas place himself in peril and his actions may contribute to freedom developing, but as George C Scott said in Patton, \"You don't die for your country, you let the other poor dumb bastxard die for his.\"\n \n Some would argue that it was irratinal to place himself in harms way. Odd you would use war as an example as I can think of nothing else capable of violating the rights of so many people with such speed as war.\n \n \nBecause the government has declared it so. I do not have the right to reject what I was not given the right to accept.\n\n \n You are completely backwards. Now you say you have not a right you do have because it wasn't given to you. You have a right to choose, to reject or accept. You are the only person who prevents you from choosing differently than you currently are.\n \n \n \nYet accurate.\n\n \n Yet not.\n \n \nOf course I still believe I have not given consent,\n \n \n You can believe in a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow, but that doesn't make it so. I have clearly shown you have given consent. If you feel so strongly about it then take away your consent. Because you dislike the alternative is not a compelling argument for the morality of your position.\n \n \nWhat makes you think I will ever be convinced that I have given consent even though I say I have not and you can't point out anything that could be rationally construed as giving consent.\n\n \n I don't think you will. Being right is far to important to you. If it wasn't you would try a more reasonable approach that you could argue from fact. \n \n \nI have not given consent at all.\n\n \n Yes you have and I have shown that you have. You have acknowledged the definition of accept, yet you still want to insist you have not.\n \n \nMy birth and existence is not consent.\n\n \n Why, how and where you exist is though.\n \n \nI could give you notice now that unless you go and live where I tell you to live or do what I tell you to do that would be 'implied' consent to my dictator ship but that would not mean that it was so.\n\n \n There are several other reasons it would not be so. None of which are applicable here.\n \n \nI do not have the right to offer you that choice and so: your failure to submit to my dictatorship before this so called 'implied' consent to that very thing.\n\n \n Good then we agree you can't make that statement so there is no point in saying anything else.\n \n \nCircular logic = The government has a right to tell you what the conditions of your life are based on where you live because you consent to it -< you consent to it because of where you live -< since you consent to it the government has the right to tell you what the conditions of your life are.\n\n \n You are going to chase your tail in a circle because your hungry, because you run around chasing your tail all day you become hungry because your hungry you chase your tail in a circle\n \n Almost anything can be turned around in circles. Doesn't mean it really is. Whatever is wrong with my statement is what is also wrong with yours.\n \n \nThe presumption that the government has the right to give me an ultimatum of this nature confuses you but not me.\n\n \n Now you are confused by your own confusion.\n \n \nUnless you can show a valid reason why the courts can alter the definition of a word it is.\n\n \n Why? The only one changing the meanings of words is not the courts.\n \n \nThe courts or congress may declare they have a right to take without permission of by force, but an unfounded assertion is itself whether it be made by a drugged mystic or albert Einstein. The only difference is authority.\n\n \n They don't say that. They say you have an obligation and you are not permitted to disregard that obligation\n \n \nMorality does not change with the circumstances,\n \n \n Of course it doesn't. It changes when people decide something is or isn't. Philosophers have tried for hundreds of years to establish inalienable rights and the success they have had are with rights that have nothing to do with this exchange.\n \n \nThe courts need to justify their decisions before I agree they are right; \n\n \n No they don't and your agreement is not necessary.\n \n \nIf you stole everything you have you have no right to anything you have.\n\n \n If it is stolen\n \n \nI am not, if you give your money to a criminal organization that does not mean it is any less criminal. You can't claim that because you donated $5 to a $5000 dollar project and the rest was stolen that the project belongs to the organization you donated to.\n\n \n And if only 1000 was stolen or none was stolen?\n \n \nUnless you claim to be able to discern exactly what was done with whose money you cannot claim the government owns it.\n\n \n Yet you can claim to be taking yours back separate from everybody elses.\n \n \nIf by dilemma you mean contradiction I do not, if by dilemma you mean a problem then yes.\n \n\n \n Problem\n \n \nHe is innocent until proven guilty, not innocent until proven in court to be guilty.\n\n \n Where exactly do you think he will be proven guilty Fairly?\n \n \nYour own logic would destroy current criminal justice but not mine.\n\n \n I can't believe you can honestly type this. I have repeatedly exposed the flaw in your concept regarding law and justice and then you act as if they don't exist and spit out this load of fantasy. Weak\n \n \nIf a man is innocent until he is proven guilty before a court then he is innocent when his home is searched, when he is arrested, when he is interrogated.\n\n \n Which is why I have probable cause and you have no exceptions for not violating rights and why you have no justice system.\n \n \nYou live in a world where every single search warrant, every arrest, every questioning is wrong.\n \n\n \n That is your system. Go back and read the last 5 exchanges and you can see how in each I have pointed this out to you as a fatal flaw. Tell me again how you don't contradict yourself?\n \n \nIt does not matter to you, you already believe rights must be violated for the sake of society.\n \n \n For the sake of law\n \n \nI work on a different premise one far more rational.\n\n \n If chaos, disorder and instability is your concept of rational you can have it.\n \n \nA man is innocent until he is proven guilty. Science makes no room for personal authority and neither does morality.\n\n \n Science is based on order among other concepts and order doesn't exist without authority and neither do many moral concepts.\n \n \nA court is not required to commit a crime nor to be guilty of it.\n\n \n Yes that is right the police are judge and jury in your version, unless they are wrong, but how would one know there is no need for court it's just a formality.\n \n Yes a court is necessary to recognize that a person is guilty.\n \n \nAs far as the law is concerned, if a prosecutor does not believe someone is guilty beyond reasonable doubt he should not try to put him in jail.\n\n \n He doesn't usually, but why would you resort to the DA the police have already somehow gathered evidence and convicted him because they arrested him.\n \n \nHe did not wait for the court case to make that decision and he should not.\n\n \n His decision causes the court case are you drinking carbonated soda and the bubbles are effecting your thinking?\n \n \nTo me the time between arrest and proof before the law of guilt is the trust given to the police nothing more.\n \n It is trusted that the police do not arrest people without proof of guilt, if they do they are wrong and they have violated a right, if they did not they have not violated a right.\n\n \n They arrest on probable cause How can someone defend themselves to the police?\n \n \nThe courts are a security system, a check and balance of the justice system.\n\n \n So far you have shown a gross misunderstanding of the legal system, contract law, reality and common sense, but you got morality down and rights your good there too.\n \n \nJust like the rest of government they should be based on the principles of morality but do not make them.\n\n \n I am not convinced you would know what that looked like if it sat in your lap.\n \n \nThat is what they ought to do.\n\n \n Again?\n \n \nI disagree but if you were right we would just have to live with it.\n\n \n What a moral idea that is.\n \n \nNo exceptions would allow no exceptions, not the risk of no exceptions.\n \n I believe probable cause is good reason for a search warrant.\n\n \n You see no conflict in these two sentences?\n \n \nWhat we disagree on is the case if the subject is innocent, you think that everything would be fine and dandy while I say that rights were violated.\n\n \n Which means in your version unless someone specifically admits guilt there is nothing that can be done. Why do you think the protections for an accused person and the obstacles necessary to convict exist? Because it is impossible to not violate some people's rights and have an effective version of law. So rules were established affording the person as much fairness and benefit of doubt as could be given and still have justice for all.\n \n \nYes the police cannot violate rights and be immune to the consequences just because their job is to find criminals. If so they need not look any farther than the mirror.\n\n \n This is one reason why your system will fail. You will have no law, no order and no stability. Justice will come from the vigilante or won't come at all.\n Why?\n \n \nYes, the proof before the law takes place at court, proof before the police takes place when they decide to arrest someone.\n\n \n How can the police not violate his rights if they arrest him because they think he may be guilty. Police cannot determine guilt. They are members of the prosecuting side of the law. \n \n \nIf you don't think any policeman would take the risk of violating the rights of an innocent man that may be the truth, we may be limited to convicting only those for whom guilt can be proven via normal investigation.\n\n \n What normal investigation? In your version a man has no right to privacy, especially a man who has been convicted of no crime? Good luck with that investigation. He will have a court oder shutting down any investigation as a violation of his rights.\n \n \nWhat would give you the right to empower men with the ability to violate rights when you would not be willing to do the same if you had to face the consequences?\n\n \n It is by agreement that law is necessary. I will listen if you think you can show we would be better off without it.\n \n \nmorality is applicable to all humans because it is a fact, the law is not.\n\n \n Both are man made concepts that do not exist without man and both may change as man changes.\n \n \nand what does it matter whether the threat comes before or after the demand?\n\n \n Because it isn't a threat. It is the result of you not obeying the law. Just as if you stole something you would go to jail. \n \n \nWhat unnecessary morality? I said if there was a moral government I would pay for what I use and nothing more.\n\n \n Why is pay as you go a condition of a moral government. Would a moral government not be obligated to cause the most fulfilling environment it capable of for its citizens? Would a moral government not cause order, stability and law? Why does government cost what you think it should. You can't even acknowledge the hundreds of benefits you have because of your current government and you think you should be trusted to be fair compensating for use? What about all the other people who like what they have or prefer it over your version are they just SOL, pay for it themselves and restrict usage? When someone decides they will pay for a freeway to be built down your street is that ok? They are paying for it.\n \n \nThe only other option is an immoral government such as the one we have now, in which I do not have a choice.\n\n \n You have a choice. Leave or don't make enough to be taxed. Not having alternatives to your liking is not a right you have and is not society's problem to figure out for you.\n \n \nI am merely telling you what I would do given the choice that is mine by right but not by judgment.\n\n \n A dozen or so paragraphs you didn't have the right, now you do?\n \n \nYou wouldn't sign an unlimited contract with a private company and I would not do so with any company.\n\n \n I bet you have and don't even know it.\n \n \nIt seems to become available at a constant rate.\n\n \n Not when you have more to do than time to do it in.\n \n \nCurrency would be unnecessary........\n \n What do these things have to do with the burden of proof I asked of you?\n\n \n Your answers show that you do indeed have a dependency on society to produce and exist in a manner conducive to happiness and longer life span. In other words it is rational for you to support society. The advantages far outweigh the disadvantages. You had stated you owe nothing to society.\n \n \nI have used premises and conclusions, you have challenged some premises and not challenged others.\n \n I have never offered \"because I said so\" as a premise for any conclusion.\n\n \n This was your response to my statement that contract law and our courts state explicit consent is not always necessary for an agreement to be valid.\n \n \nQuote:\n Then they are wrong. You cannot agree to something except by agreeing to it. You must communicate your assent to the other party in explicit terms. \n",

You can post if you like I may not respond though. \n \n Below I have taken several of what I believe are your primary points and responded to each. If I missed something feel free to add it in.\n \n Taxation is theft\n \n Unfair, intentionally complex, manipulative are what taxation is. Theft it is not. It is an obligation that you have agreed to. Your actions and bore failure to act, both being that you are choosing, constitute your acceptance. Terms and conditions are laid out in the U.S. Constitution, Bill of Rights and other documents you studied in high school or college and are all over the Internet. If it is not theft legally and is permitted legally and the payor is obligated to remit an amount specified by the payee then it cannot be considered immoral.\n \n Never signed in the contract\n \n It does not need your signature. Your choice, freely made, is your acceptance. The alternatives not been to your liking is not a reason that it invalidates the agreement. Your parents made you a U S citizen so take it up with them if you are unhappy about it. Government does not have to negotiate with you. The deal is what it is.\n \n Government doesn't own property or was gained illegally\n \n If government doesn't have the right to property neither do you where do you think your property originally came from or who make claim to it first. The same laws that grant you your property are the laws that permit government to own its property.\n Society cannot enact laws that violate individual rights\n Wolves that is true that there would be no government and no tax, but you have only what you could take from others in what you could keep without others taken from you. Without society, you would like to live in a cave if you live long enough to notice.\n \n Government and the mafia\n \n They differ in that the mafia does not own or what it does own can be shown to have been acquired illegally. In addition, those who are victims have no say or recourse in the exchange. The mafia acts outside the law in gives no benefit to the ones doing the pain.\n \n I still think you have a much better argument for not paying taxes by declaring the government mismanages and it is irresponsible with the resources it is entrusted with. No entity is exempt under the law for willful misconduct or gross negligence. The government can easily be shown to be guilty of both. Taxation on the other hand has been upheld in numerous court proceedings. Even if that were not the case, government is necessary in maintaining stability and order. It must have the ability to perform its function effectively and the burden of doing so must be born by the governed as equally as possible.",

   "Define theft please.\n\n \n Theft\n the act of stealing; the wrongful taking and carrying away of the personal goods or property of another; larceny. \n \n Steal\n to take (the property of another or others) without permission or right, esp. secretly or by force\n \n Larceny\n in criminal law, the trespassory taking and carrying away of personal goods from the possession of another with intent to steal. Larceny is one of the specific crimes included in the general category of theft (q.v.).\n \n Taxation\n 1. \n the act of taxing\n \n Tax\n a sum of money demanded by a government for its support or for specific facilities or services, levied upon incomes, property, sales, etc. \n \n \nTo agree I must agree, that event has never taken place. Knowledge of a contract does not equal assent to it.\n\n \n It does when coupled with action. Renewal of a contract can occur by inaction or would be considered enforceable based on your knowledge of it.\n \n \nIn essence your response to that has been that I implicitly agreed by not leaving, however since no one has a right to demand my departure it is not a service accepted to stay, therefore no action I take in reference to my residence can make an agreement on that matter.\n\n \n What makes you think no one has the right to demand your departure. Do you not believe in property rights? If a dozen people decided to move into your house, you don't have the right to demand they leave?\n \n \nIn other words you cannot sell me what you don't have and I cannot implicitly form an agreement with you by sitting on my couch because you claim (incorrectly) to own my couch.\n\n \n I can when I own the dirt your couch is on and the sign posted 40 feet away clearly states temporary storage $5.00/hr.\n \n \nTo argue that since I did sit on my couch and I never went out found you and told you that you were a nutcase for thinking the couch was yours I agreed to some contract is completely bypassing the requirements for an agreement to exist.\n \n\n \n Now since this isn't a comparable comparison it really doesn't matter what the result of it is. You can also think of a parking meter. It doesn't do anything. It is your responsibility to comply with the nonnegotiable terms set forth by government to use the space for a restricted period of time. Even though the road, the meter and enforcement were all paid for from public money.\n \n \n \nThe terms must be known and accepted; one of the terms in this example is the premise that you own the couch.\n\n \n The terms are known and your actions constitute acceptance. \n \n You presume that you own the country or have the right to freely come and go as you please. Only by agreeing to be bound by US laws can you do so. I don't know about you but I don't see a benefit to allowing people not subject to US law roaming the nation doing as they please.\n \n \nOne of the terms in your proposed implicit agreement with the government is the premise that any part of my life or my interaction with any person is the governments to trade.\n\n \n Where did you come up with that?\n \n \nSince without this proposed implicit agreement your argument that it is not theft falls apart let us concentrate on its existence.\n\n \n You seem to think you have refuted it, but comparing apples to oranges isn't going to cut it. You also need to justify why you think you have the right to remain in the country but not be subject to it's laws and how from a legal perspective you have not agreed. \n \n \n \nThe fact that I never agreed to the contract is invalidation.\n\n \n I have clearly shown what is sufficient legally to be considered acceptance. You just keep saying no it isn't and that is it. There is an accepted English definition of the word as well as a legal definition. You don't get to redefine the language and the law to fit your argument.\n \n \nA non-choice != choice.\n\n \n The choice to remain so is yours nobody is holding a gun to your head and saying you must remain a US Citizen. You are staying of your own free will. Choice = Choice\n \n \nIt does if it wishes to reach an agreement.\n \n\n \n So it doesn't reach an agreement with you. It will be sad but it isn't going to make you accept something you don't want to. That of course means the perks of the deal are not available to you. You would be choosing to to give up the benefits of being a US Citizen\n \n \nThe deal is not a moral one.\n\n \n Why? Because it imposes restrictions you don't like? What is the purpose of doing so? If it was simply to exercise control you might be right. But it isn't, it is to promote and maintain stability and order and an environment conducive to progress and the objectives stated in our founding documents.\n \n \nI will switch illegally to immorally in which case you just said A or A, if it was gained immorally that it is not actually the property of the government.\n\n \n Glad I didn't say that. \n \n You can change the word if you want but the meaning has to stay consistent. The statement can't be expected to have the same meaning if you change the wording.\n \n These were your arguments, not mine.\n \n \nWe both have the right to property neither of us have the right to stolen property or anything we do with it.\n\n \n Good. I will assume you didn't steal yours and government didn't, unless you count the Indians which would mean you wouldn't own yours either though.\n \n So now each has a right to their respective property.\n \n \nI live and work under the premise that gifts are the only property I own that I did not create the equivalent wealth of.\n \n That premise is courtesy of capitalism (thanks capitalism I love you! emoticon_xlove)\n\n \n Ever have a car payment? How about a mortgage? Credit card? Not until they were paid off did you own what you had created the equivalent wealth of. When you say you like capitalism do you mean you like the concept, but aren't interested in how and why you experience it or do think it is your right to do so?\n \n \nLaws do not grant me property; they recognize my right to it.\n\n \n No government recognizes your right to property. Law is the mechanism that defines it, but either way, the same law recognizes government and others right to property as well\n \n \nIs that a proposed law of morality?\n\n \n I went back and read what I typed and I don't know what happened. It was supposed to be \n \n Society cannot enact laws that violate individual rights\n \n If that was true then there would be no government and no tax, but you would only have what you could take from others and what you could keep without others taking from you. Without society, you would most likly live in a cave if you lived long enough to notice.\n \n \nWas an analogy to show you that morality does not depend on the civility, intentions, or power of the violator.\n\n \n Nor of the one being violated\n \n \nIt may seem better to you because it is based on premises that you accept. \n\n \n I accept them is not the same as I like them. I accept them because they are the best available and achievable.\n \n \nMy refusal to accept these premises seems to leave you unable to argue cogently against my conclusions.\n\n \n Because your conclusions are based on part real, part assumption. You adopt favorable treatment for yourself at the cost of others, while declaring its a value for all. You don't maintain a standard with which to determine or compare your concepts of what is and what should be.\n \n \n \nNamely to say that the government mismanages and is irresponsible with taxes implies that they should manage and be responsible for them.\n\n \n That is part of why government was formed and if not them then who? You have stated a voluntary tax system to meet the needs of the population, in that scenario who would be be responsible?\n \n \n \nPerhaps, but suing a company for mismanaging your money will no doubt imply that you wished them to manage it. That is the sort of implicating action you wish dearly to exist in my case.\n\n \n How else would they have your money. If you though it had been stolen you wouldn't wait and see if the thief gets a good ROI and then sue if he doesn't.\n \n \nI think you know I don't care; frankly you shouldn't care either, at one time in history witch burning was upheld in numerous court proceedings. \n\n \n It isn't an appeal to authority that is fallacious. The witch burning though would be. What type of argument is I don't care? The legal ramifications of court rulings on taxation have a big impact on the legality and morality of taxation. After all both are only what society agrees they will be.\n \n \nHistory proves that an appeal to authority is generally the weakest of all arguments.\n\n \n But not always.\n \n \nAgain you are working on the unstated premise that taxation is necessary for government.\n \n\n \n It has been tried without and didn't work. Countries that have no taxation tend to have not a whole lot of things we take for granted.",

   "Steal\n to take (the property of another or others) without permission or right, esp. secretly or by force\n\n Taxation is regardless of permission and therefore regardless of right.\n \n Clearly there is only one defense left to taxation to escape the definition of stealing and that is to claim it was in fact by permission (by contract). You apparently agree because that is the defense you used.\n \n \nIt does when coupled with action.\n\n Not action that is not exclusive to assent.\n \n A company may setup inherently illegal contract and then claim they provide a service neccesary for everyone to speak to each other.\n \n Speaking is not equal to signing that contract because when you speak you had that right and ability regardless of any contract being offered. When I live in this country I do so regardless of any contract being offered as it is in my ability and within my rights. (please avoid blind contradiction here)\n \n In the end you must claim that the government has the right to offer me the choice between imprisonment/fines and taxation.\n \n That is the core and to avoid further out of control post size I will respond only minimally to the rest of your post.\n \n \n \nWhat makes you think no one has the right to demand your departure.\n\n There is no sound justification. I have a right to myself (the first law of morality if you will) and the land I use has no greater claim on it than mine.\n \n \nDo you not believe in property rights? If a dozen people decided to move into your house, you don&#8217;t have the right to demand they leave?\n\n Yes, and yes.\n \n As I have said the unspoken premise that the government owns everything in the country is one you have used several times.\n \n \nI can when I own the dirt your couch is on and the sign posted 40 feet away clearly states temporary storage $5.00/hr.\n\n This is a red herring fallacy. You modified my analogy without sound comparison to reality.\n \n As I said applying this modification of the analogy to the actual situation would yield the point \"The government can offer you that choice if you are using its property by living here\".\n \n \n \nNow since this isn&#8217;t a comparable comparison it really doesn&#8217;t matter what the result of it is.\n\n It is a comparable comparison; you are claiming I am accepting a service by existing and owning property inside this country. You claim I must cancel this contract.\n \n Those elements existed respectivly as the service of a couch to sit on and the need to cancel the contract.\n \n \nyour actions constitute acceptance. \n\n Why?\n \n I remain perfectly within my rights to completely refuse to recognize any part of this contract, that is impossible with any reasonable example of contract accepted via service used.\n \n i.e. I can't use a car wash and refuse any contract that may exist with it (that is a contradiction in terms for a lack of contract renders the car wash another person&#8217;s property without permission being given)\n \n Yet I can wash my own car and remain non-contradictory to a service that offers to wash your car for you.\n \n In other words I don't need the gas station or the government to give me permission to use or have what is mine.\n \n \nYou presume that you own the country or have the right to freely come and go as you please.\n\n I know only the latter.\n \n \nOnly by agreeing to be bound by US laws can you do so.\n\n By what right do you add that condition? (yes I mean real right not legal right)\n \nI don't know about you but I don't see a benefit to allowing people not subject to US law roaming the nation doing as they please.\n\n It is for you to determine the benefit by your best judgment but not to do a thing about it (that you don't have a right to do).\n \n \nWhere did you come up with that?\n\n The premise that social interaction is a privilege of submitting to government, it is not.\n \n You implied it several times I trust you remember and won't make me quote them.\n \n \nYou seem to think you have refuted it\n\n Yes, you seem to think I haven't.\n \nbut comparing apples to oranges isn&#8217;t going to cut it.\n\n I did not use analogies at first, however; you believed some premises applied to government matters that did not to others and these analogies are excellent in showing that there is no good reason to make up arbitrary rules of logic like that.\n \n I maintain that most of my analogies have been good comparisons especially the one with the cable company.\n \nYou also need to justify why you think you have the right to remain in the country but not be subject to it&#8217;s laws\n\n I have a right to remain in the country because I am a human being and this country is in the natural world.\n \n The only case to remove me from where I live is:\n A. I have lost the right by violating someone else&#8217;s rights\n B. My claim to the land is invalid\n \n I believe there is a simple rational rule set to govern the claiming of natural resources but I am certain my claim to the land my house is on is valid.\n \n The reason I am not subject to laws I went into in some depth previously\n \nfrom a legal perspective you have not agreed. \n\n Legality is what many accuse morality of, a self-closing set of circular premises.\n \n All reduced merely to someone&#8217;s judgment as to what the rules of society should be.\n \n I have nothing against judgments that is for sure, but no one has the right to force their own judgments on others; using sound arguments you can leave them no rational alternative but you may never force them.\n \n Any law that is not based directly off objective morality is such an act.\n \n This all boils down to \"I don't care about defending anything I say or do from a legal perspective.\"\n \n \nI have clearly shown what is sufficient legally to be considered acceptance.\n\n Ohhh, this whole time I thought you were trying to show that I did accept not that I legally accepted; no wonder I didn't understand your points.\n \n You are probably, no certainly right.\n \nYou just keep saying no it isn&#8217;t and that is it.\n\n I am in an excellent position to tell you I never agreed to the contract you propose I did.\n \nThere is an accepted English definition of the word as well as a legal definition. You don&#8217;t get to redefine the language and the law to fit your argument.\n\n Here is accept, what in it contains something I have contradicted?\n 1. to take or receive (something offered); receive with approval or favor: to accept a present; to accept a proposal. \n 2. to agree or consent to; accede to: to accept a treaty; to accept an apology. \n 3. to respond or answer affirmatively to: to accept an invitation. \n 4. to undertake the responsibility, duties, honors, etc., of: to accept the office of president. \n 5. to receive or admit formally, as to a college or club. \n 6. to accommodate or reconcile oneself to: to accept the situation. \n 7. to regard as true or sound; believe: to accept a claim; to accept Catholicism. \n 8. to regard as normal, suitable, or usual. \n 9. to receive as to meaning; understand. \n 10. Commerce . to acknowledge, by Signature, as calling for payment, and thus to agree to pay, as a draft. \n 11. (in a deliberative body) to receive as an adequate performance of the duty with which an officer or a committee has been charged; receive for further action: The report of the committee was accepted. \n 12. to receive or contain (something attached, inserted, etc.): This socket won't accept a three-pronged plug. \n 13. to receive (a transplanted organ or tissue) without adverse reaction. Compare reject ( def. 7 ) . \n \n \n \nThe choice to remain so is yours nobody is holding a gun to your head and saying you must remain a US Citizen.\n\n The choice that would involve guns and cuffs would be choosing to remain and not to fulfill the obligations of a US Citizen.\n \nYou are staying of your own free will. Choice = Choice\n\n My rights are not being violated of my own free will (good thing to that is a self-contradictory statement)\n \n \nYou would be choosing to to give up the benefits of being a US Citizen\n\n The only perk exclusive to the US government I am aware of is not being attacked by the US government.\n \n \n \nWhy?\n\n It specifically prohibits the necessary normally implied option given to the offeree \"or you do not agree and none of the terms above apply\"\n \n \nGlad I didn't say that. \n \n You can change the word if you want but the meaning has to stay consistent. The statement can't be expected to have the same meaning if you change the wording.\n \n These were your arguments, not mine.\n\n In that case I have no comment.\n \n \nGood. I will assume you didn't steal yours and government didn't,\n\n The second would be incorrect.\n \n \nEver have a car payment? How about a mortgage? Credit card? Not until they were paid off did you own what you had created the equivalent wealth of.\n\n Indeed.\n \nWhen you say you like capitalism do you mean you like the concept, but aren't interested in how and why you experience it or do think it is your right to do so?\n\n Capitalism is inherent in a free society (unless you call corporations public entities), So I do have the 'right to it'.\n \n If you are specifically talking about unified currency that is something I would certainly support in society but it is an accomplishment of many so I cannot have a right to it.\n \n \nNo government recognizes your right to property.\n\n I know.\n \n \nI went back and read what I typed and I don't know what happened. It was supposed to be \n \n Society cannot enact laws that violate individual rights\n \n If that was true then there would be no government and no tax, but you would only have what you could take from others and what you could keep without others taking from you. Without society, you would most likly live in a cave if you lived long enough to notice.\n\n I see so you were saying:\n Society must enact laws that violate individual rights if civilization is to exist \n \n \n \nI accept them is not the same as I like them. I accept them because they are the best available and achievable.\n\n Well I am here to tell you there is good reason not to accept them and to continue doing so is illogical.\n \n \nBecause your conclusions are based on part real, part assumption.\n\n I promise that if you can name one thing that I assumed (assumed as in take to be true without reason) you will get a big sloppy apology.\n \n \nYou adopt favorable treatment for yourself at the cost of others,\n\n I reject the notion that those kind of choices exist for a moral person, i.e. if you think you are faced with one check your premises before you do something wrong.\n \n \nwhile declaring its a value for all.\n\n I think it's a safe premise that most people want society, I know it's a safe premise that morality is valuable for everyone. (it simply may be of less value than immorality to criminals)\n \n \nYou don't maintain a standard with which to determine or compare your concepts of what is and what should be.\n\n What should be for me is a combination of the problems that exist now and what I think the best solution would be.\n \n The standard of what is, is reality; a problem is identified also by what is.\n \n I do not declare that stealing is wrong in a vacuum I declare its wrong because of what man is, what man is now not what he should be.\n \n Problems are things that are that shouldn't be and problems as far as what I'm talking about are the immoral and whatever practical problems that are entangled with them.\n \n \n \n \nThat is part of why government was formed and if not them then who?\n \n No one, no one should be able to steal.\n \n \nYou have stated a voluntary tax system to meet the needs of the population,\n \n No I stated many times that I am not working off the definition of taxes as \"whatever pays for government\" but specifically fees enforced regardless of volition by a government.\n \n In which case voluntary taxes is self-contradictory phrase.\n \nin that scenario who would be be responsible?\n\n In the scenario of my voluntary government a branch of the government would be responsible for carrying out the will of the people.. including accounting (executive).\n \n \nHow else would they have your money.\n\n I would pay them according to what government actions and bills I agreed to. (and yes they could come arrest me if I broke my contracts)\n \nIf you though it had been stolen you wouldn't wait and see if the thief gets a good ROI and then sue if he doesn't.\n\n Aye :)\n \n \n \nIt isn't an appeal to authority that is fallacious. The witch burning though would be.\n\n If you can answer why an appeal to authority on witch burning is fallacious but your appeal to the courts is not you will have saved me some time.\n \nWhat type of argument is I don't care? \n\n It's not an argument; an appeal to authority is meaningless against deductive argument (it's inductive).\n \n \nThe legal ramifications of court rulings on taxation have a big impact on the legality and morality of taxation.\n\n They have had no impact on the morality of taxation, nothing that has changed in the past 100,000 years does.\n \nAfter all both are only what society agrees they will be.\n\n The first is, the second is what science knows it is.\n \n \nBut not always.\n\n Not always.\n \n \nIt has been tried without and didn't work.\n\n How many times did someone try to fly before the wright brothers?\n \n How many tribes rose and fell before the first city or centralized government?\n \n \"it hasn't been done before\" is a valid argument for caution, not for impossibility.\n \n Although I did not stay true to my intention not to make a large post I would not object if you concentrated on implied contracts in your response.",

Not difficult to understand.\n \n \n \ni.e. I can't use a car wash and refuse any contract that may exist with it (that is a contradiction in terms for a lack of contract renders the car wash another person&#8217;s property without permission being given)\n \n Yet I can wash my own car and remain non-contradictory to a service that offers to wash your car for you.\n\n \n Apples and oranges\n \n \nIn other words I don't need the gas station or the government to give me permission to use or have what is mine.\n \n\n \n You need to be a citizen or have permission to live and transact within the borders of the US without it you wouldn't have the ability to have what you have.\n \n \n By what right do you add that condition? (yes I mean real right not legal right)\n \n \nIt is for you to determine the benefit by your best judgment but not to do a thing about it (that you don't have a right to do).\n \n\n \n Yes, that is what government id for\n \n \nThe premise that social interaction is a privilege of submitting to government, it is not.\n\n \n Nice try. You may have all the social interaction you desire conditioned on your obeying the law if physical and inside the borders. Or do whatever you want via letters, email, telephone etc outside the borders. See you don't have to submit to government. I am well aware you don't like the alternatives, no need to say it again.\n \n \n \nI have a right to remain in the country because I am a human being and this country is in the natural world.\n\n \n Everybody is a human being and everything is in the natural world. So everybody has a right to everything. \n \n \n \nThe only case to remove me from where I live is:\n A. I have lost the right by violating someone else&#8217;s rights\n B. My claim to the land is invalid\n\n \n A. Renounce your citizenship and stay and you have\n b. Never accepting citizenship and it is\n \n \n \nI believe there is a simple rational rule set to govern the claiming of natural resources but I am certain my claim to the land my house is on is valid.\n\n \n How many easements on your property? But it isn't about property rights its about violating the law and the rights of others.\n \n \nLegality is what many accuse morality of, a self-closing set of circular premises.\n \n All reduced merely to someone&#8217;s judgment as to what the rules of society should be.\n\n \n Law is more objective than morality, not is but more\n \n \nI have nothing against judgments that is for sure, but no one has the right to force their own judgments on others; using sound arguments you can leave them no rational alternative but you may never force them.\n\n \n \n Lifeboat the fat man and sophies choice. What is the moral solution?\n \n \nAny law that is not based directly off objective morality is such an act.\n\n \n No such animal exists. Morality is subjective\n \n \nThis all boils down to \"I don't care about defending anything I say or do from a legal perspective.\"\n\n \n That is why people are subject to laws and rights are conditional.\n \n \nOhhh, this whole time I thought you were trying to show that I did accept not that I legally accepted; no wonder I didn't understand your points.\n \n You are probably, no certainly right.\n\n \n Good, I am glad you agree taxes are not theft.\n \n \n \nI am in an excellent position to tell you I never agreed to the contract you propose I did.\n\n \n Confidence in error is unbecoming\n \n \nHere is accept, what in it contains something I have contradicted?\n\n \n You haven't you have accepted.\n \n \n \nThe choice that would involve guns and cuffs would be choosing to remain and not to fulfill the obligations of a US Citizen.\n\n \n What should happen to people who break their legal obligation?\n \n \nMy rights are not being violated of my own free will (good thing to that is a self-contradictory statement)\n\n \n You could look at it that way, but you would need to show you retain your rights even when you violate the law. \n \n \nThe only perk exclusive to the US government I am aware of is not being attacked by the US government.\n\n \n When a burglar breaks into your house and sets it on fire call the Canadian police and the Mexican fire dept and see how responsive they are\n \n \nIt specifically prohibits the necessary normally implied option given to the offeree \"or you do not agree and none of the terms above apply\"\n\n \n You misunderstand. Governemnt isn't really able to offer it just manages.\n \n If you do not accept then none of the terms apply is correct. They don't if you don't and niether do the rights and protections. You want your cable for free again I see. \n \n \n \nCapitalism is inherent in a free society (unless you call corporations public entities), So I do have the 'right to it'.\n\n \n Isn't it neat how things match up. In the US we don't have a free economy, just as we don't have unconditional rights. Both are regulated.\n \n \nI see so you were saying:\n Society must enact laws that violate individual rights if civilization is to exist \n\n \n What do you think laws do? They restrict rights. You don't seem to have a problem when it comes to restricting others from taking your house.\n \n \nI reject the notion that those kind of choices exist for a moral person, i.e. if you think you are faced with one check your premises before you do something wrong.\n\n \n And that is different than \"because I said so\" how?\n \n \nI think it's a safe premise that most people want society, I know it's a safe premise that morality is valuable for everyone. (it simply may be of less value than immorality to criminals)\n\n \n That would make rights subjective and unequal.\n \n \nThe standard of what is, is reality; a problem is identified also by what is.\n\n \n Then only what is is reality. Taxes being immoral is not what is. That is only a problem for you, but is not what is so isn't real?\n \n \nI do not declare that stealing is wrong in a vacuum I declare its wrong because of what man is, what man is now not what he should be.\n\n \n That would make man a thief and your right he shouldn't be.\n \n \nIn the scenario of my voluntary government a branch of the government would be responsible for carrying out the will of the people.. including accounting (executive).\n \n\n \n Here is where you assume it would be effective.\n \n \nI would pay them according to what government actions and bills I agreed to. (and yes they could come arrest me if I broke my contracts)\n\n \n Here is where you assume this would be cost effective and reasonable\n \n \nIf you can answer why an appeal to authority on witch burning is fallacious but your appeal to the courts is not you will have saved me some time.\n \n\n \n Witches as in brides of Satan don't exist and you can't be an authority claiming something is real when it isn't.\n \n \n \nThe first is, the second is what science knows it is.\n \n\n \n Science cannot know it objectively",

I don't think such a thing can exist.\n\n Then I will take this opportunity then to launch an Ad Absurdum argument against your view of society.\n \n Morality is about right and wrong, the way I speak about it specifically the right and wrong in human social interaction.\n \n Saying that it is subjective is saying that a class of action can be wrong for one person to do but not another or vice versa.\n \n If morality is not objective it is subjective (changing with each person), since no universals can be stated about a subjective attribute in the abstract any universal referring to a subjective morality is inherently fallacious in the abstract (society) as well.\n \n Laws must exist for society to exist and given a subjective morality laws cannot be based on morality (inherently fallacious to base a universal..)\n \n They can then only have a non-objective foundation or the pseudo-objective base of \"what is best for society\", both the dictates of some entity.\n \n This entity could be a dictator, emperor, a democracy, republic, senate ect...\n \n Now for the absurd conclusions:\n \n 1.) Since law is not based on morality breaking the law cannot be immoral.\n \n 1.a) Since breaking a law can't be right or wrong, the only motivation not to break the law is fear of punishment, everyone who has this point of view takes the same mindset as a successful criminal.\n \n 1.b) Since the only standard of validity for laws is now military power the most valid lawmakers are the most powerful.\n \n 2.) Since right and wrong changes from person to person what is wrong for you may not be wrong for others. Therefore you may make no moral judgments about anyone but yourself.\n \n 2.1a) In practice that means that the Nazi's weren't evil, you only think they are evil and if you didn't have popular support behind you, you wouldn't be so sure.\n \n 2.2) It means there is no such thing as rights; for what you think your rights are is not always what another thinks they are. Therefore the only rights you have are what society deems (assuming that is the entity handing out the dictates of law)\n \n 2.2a) In practice that means that slaves in the old south did not have their rights trampled upon they only thought they did(sometimes), society disagreed and so did it's laws.\n \n This state of thought is only compatible with anarchy or despotism and so those who reach it must find an escape if they live in society. They do so in applying a standard that can compensate for the irregularity and rebase morality as the basis of social behavior.\n \n They do so with the concept of moral authority, something is right or wrong because of who said it and why.\n \n The moral authority of a roman was the will of Rome and the emperor, your moral authority is the will of the citizenry of the United States.\n \n Many people's moral authority is charismatic leaders, political parties, nationalities ect.\n \n In a discussion on this thread with Sigma he was deeply confused at the idea of objective morality and kept asking \"on whose authority?\".\n \n There is another 'objective' morality, one based on the premise that man's individual life is not a value and is in fact the standard of evil. It is like the true morality in all but an incorrect assertion that man's nature is not an individual mind but a society. (Collectivism)\n \n The two objective moralities and right by might are the three recurring bases for 'morality' in societies.\n \n \n \nAll morality is subjective since there is no purely objective anchor to start with.\n\n There is, the nature of man. He is an individual and if good has a meaning it's the values he chooses because of his life.\n \n \nMorality will always have an emotional bias in what is and is not moral. \n\n I am proof that is not true.\n \n \nIt is a great concept but one I don't believe is possible by human beings.\n\n It's not that hard actually, and it gets easier.\n \nOur creativity and emotions, two things that make us human, are not conducive to being objective.\n\n Those are not the two things that make us human.\n \n This reminds me of when I read an article claiming to prove animals had emotions, what I was surprised at was the idea that someone didn't think they did.\n \n It has always seemed quite apparent to me.",

I can take you through the logic again if you wish.\n \n If man's life is a value then objective morality is inescapable, unfortunalty it does leave a lot of room to gallop around so it may take some time to realize this is true.\n \n\n \n Your life having a value is a subjective concept, and therefore to use it as 'objective morality' is null and void.\n \n The only way a 'man's life' is given value is the evaluation of man. \n \n All take this opportunity then to launch an Ad Absurdum argument against your view of society.\n \n Morality is about right and wrong, the way I speak about it specifically the right and wrong in human social interaction.\n \n Saying that it is subjective is saying that a class of action can be wrong for one person to do but not another or vice versa.\n \n If morality is not objective it is subjective (changing with each person), since no universals can be stated about a subjective attribute in the abstract any universal referring to a subjective morality is inherently fallacious in the abstract (society) as well.\n \n Laws must exist for society to exist and given a subjective morality laws cannot be based on morality (inherently fallacious to base a universal..)\n \n They can then only have a non-objective foundation or the pseudo-objective base of \"what is best for society\", both the dictates of some entity.\n \n This entity could be a dictator, emperor, a democracy, republic, senate ect...\n \n Now for the absurd conclusions:\n \n 1.) Since law is not based on morality breaking the law cannot be immoral.\n \n 1.a) Since breaking a law can't be right or wrong, the only motivation not to break the law is fear of punishment, everyone who has this point of view takes the same mindset as a successful criminal.\n \n 1.b) Since the only standard of validity for laws is now military power the most valid lawmakers are the most powerful.\n \n 2.) Since right and wrong changes from person to person what is wrong for you may not be wrong for others. Therefore you may make no moral judgments about anyone but yourself.\n \n 2.1a) In practice that means that the Nazi's weren't evil, you only think they are evil and if you didn't have popular support behind you, you wouldn't be so sure.\n \n 2.2) It means there is no such thing as rights; for what you think your rights are is not always what another thinks they are. Therefore the only rights you have are what society deems (assuming that is the entity handing out the dictates of law)\n \n 2.2a) In practice that means that slaves in the old south did not have their rights trampled upon they only thought they did(sometimes), society disagreed and so did it's laws.\n \n This state of thought is only compatible with anarchy or despotism and so those who reach it must find an escape if they live in society. They do so in applying a standard that can compensate for the irregularity and rebase morality as the basis of social behavior.\n \n They do so with the concept of moral authority, something is right or wrong because of who said it and why.\n \n The moral authority of a roman was the will of Rome and the emperor, your moral authority is the will of the citizenry of the United States.\n \n Many people's moral authority is charismatic leaders, political parties, nationalities ect.\n \n In a discussion on this thread with Sigma he was deeply confused at the idea of objective morality and kept asking \"on whose authority?\".\n \n There is another 'objective' morality, one based on the premise that man's individual life is not a value and is in fact the standard of evil. It is like the true morality in all but an incorrect assertion that man's nature is not an individual mind but a society. (Collectivism)\n \n The two objective moralities and right by might are the three recurring bases for 'morality' in societies.\n \n \n \n There is, the nature of man. He is an individual and if good has a meaning it's the values he chooses because of his life.\n \n \n I am proof that is not true.\n \n \n It's not that hard actually, and it gets easier.\n \n Those are not the two things that make us human.\n \n This reminds me of when I read an article claiming to prove animals had emotions, what I was surprised at was the idea that someone didn't think they did.\n \n It has always seemed quite apparent to me.[/QUOTE]\n \n Well, it might seem apparent to you, but it is just your subjective conditioning.

Morality can remain subjective but by agreement not change within a group. Being objective it will never change, being subjective it might. \n \n Being objective at what point is morality understood as such. 1000 years ago it was not believed that slavery was immoral, now we believe they were wrong then and we are right now to think it is immoral. If morality was objective how could an immoral act be understood to be moral and how could it then be changed to be understood correctly as immoral? There would be no reason to question and arrive to a different conclusion.\n \n \nLaws must exist for society to exist and given a subjective morality laws cannot be based on morality (inherently fallacious to base a universal..)\n\n \n Law must exist for society to survive and thrive. Law can be based on subjective morality, but law isn't based on a universal notion on how it is defined. Law is defined by society and evolves with society. Different societies may agree in whole or in part with each other or may not.\n \n \nThey can then only have a non-objective foundation or the pseudo-objective base of \"what is best for society\", both the dictates of some entity.\n \n This entity could be a dictator, emperor, a democracy, republic, senate ect...\n\n \n Is there anywhere this is not the case?

If not then how is it objective?\n \n Now for the absurd conclusions:\n \n \n1.) Since law is not based on morality breaking the law cannot be immoral.\n\n \n If all things are moral or immoral and breaking the law isn't immoral then it must be moral to break the law.\n \n A conclusion based upon an incorrect assumption is what makes this absurd. If you start with a fallacy you will most likely end up with one in the end also.\n \n \n1.a) Since breaking a law can't be right or wrong, the only motivation not to break the law is fear of punishment, everyone who has this point of view takes the same mindset as a successful criminal.\n\n \n See above and add contradiction. Is it only fear of punishment that keeps a person from going 150mph? (assuming the car is capable)\n \n \n \n1.b) Since the only standard of validity for laws is now military power the most valid lawmakers are the most powerful.\n\n \n Ah now the military would that be similiar to an armed and organized society? Don't you have issue with the ability of the masses to even exist collectively?\n \n Yes they are and show me where and when the honor system has ever been a success in a population over 100.\n \n \n2.) Since right and wrong changes from person to person what is wrong for you may not be wrong for others. Therefore you may make no moral judgments about anyone but yourself.\n\n \n If only religion would accept that. Because right and wrong may change does not mean it has to change. One should be mindful of making unnecessary moral judgments of others\n \n \n \n2.1a) In practice that means that the Nazi's weren't evil, you only think they are evil and if you didn't have popular support behind you, you wouldn't be so sure.\n\n \n To them they weren't and if they had won you probably wouldn't be so sure yourself.\n \n \n2.2) It means there is no such thing as rights; for what you think your rights are is not always what another thinks they are. Therefore the only rights you have are what society deems (assuming that is the entity handing out the dictates of law)\n\n \n But people do disagree, yet where they think in the affirmative those rights exist and are respected and where they are not there exist different rights. \n \n What rights do have without society? Your right to yourself? A bear will eat you just the same after you explain your right to your person to it. The same is true of a murderer or thief. Society is what protects your rights when you are unable and it determines which ones it will by agreement.\n \n \n2.2a) In practice that means that slaves in the old south did not have their rights trampled upon they only thought they did(sometimes), society disagreed and so did it's laws.\n\n \n Addressed slavery already\n \n \nThis state of thought is only compatible with anarchy or despotism and so those who reach it must find an escape if they live in society. They do so in applying a standard that can compensate for the irregularity and rebase morality as the basis of social behavior.\n\n \n Based on incorrect concepts it is still hard to reach this conclusion, but you have done so. I could argue that both are just as likely with objective morality since it is easily misunderstood or ignored becoming meaningless and ineffectual until those conditions change.\n \n \n \nThey do so with the concept of moral authority, something is right or wrong because of who said it and why.\n\n \n You seem always to ignore or forget consent and agreement. I cannot go outside and proclaim I am morally permitted to rob my neighbor and then do so. Subjective doesn't mandate that concepts must not be in agreement, or be unique to the individual. Murder is considered immoral. Capital punishment, assisted suicide, abortion, war or accidental can be moral or immoral. Why is there a distinction between methods that end in the same result. If killing another person is objectively immoral then why they are killed wouldn't change that, but it does\n \n \nThe moral authority of a roman was the will of Rome and the emperor, your moral authority is the will of the citizenry of the United States.\n\n \n When in rome.....\n \n \nMany people's moral authority is charismatic leaders, political parties, nationalities ect.\n\n \n Christians get it from God, Satanists from Lucifer, kids from their parents and pets from their owners but in the end it is society using government that determines the minimum degree of morality.\n \n \nIn a discussion on this thread with Sigma he was deeply confused at the idea of objective morality and kept asking \"on whose authority?\".\n\n \n It is a valid question.

This only drives home the point that personal or collective whim is insufficient and invalid on this matter (and all others if I had my way).\n \n \n \nLaw must exist for society to survive and thrive.

That does not mean morality, your particular religion, or your skin are evil.\n \n Now for an observation that will never be realized, if everyone was rational in all significant matters and therefore everyone was moral, morality would have all positive effects on each person's life.\n \n \nIf so then why is that not the case?

That explains a morally bankrupt lot.\n\n Easy's god is a paper tiger in a book. \n \n What strikes me as evil is someone who uses his or her personal beliefs to attempt to control others to tell them what they may or may not do. That smacks of pride and arrogance, and I personally find it abhorrent. Evil is not being tolerant of others to think and act freely as they choose so long as they are not harming another. Easy is a prime example of this.",

   "\"Evil\" is the subjective opinion based on how something negatively effects an individual or society.\n\n Well as I said all subjective statements are inherently false, so lets convert that to an objective statement.\n \n Whether something is good or bad is the judgement of an individual, not all individuals will make the same judgement.\n \n Do you agree with this statement?\n \n \nWell, you certainly don't understand what the Ad hominien arguemetn is.. It is against the person rather than against the argument.\n \n \"You are wrong because you are a Christian' would be an ad homien'. You are wrong because of blah blah blah' is not an ad hominen, nor is 'you are wrong because of blah blah blah, you stupid XXXXX. would be an insult, but not an ad hominein. Do try to get some education someday. It would be good for you.\n\n You committed an ad hominem fallacy (specifically circumstance), and an argument by dismissal fallacy.\n \n Ad hominem circumstantial points out that someone is in circumstances such that he is disposed to take a particular position. Ad hominem circumstantial constitutes an attack on the bias of a source. This is fallacious because a disposition to make a certain argument does not make the argument false; this overlaps with the genetic fallacy (an argument that a claim is incorrect due to its source).\n \n Argument By Dismissal: \n an idea is rejected without saying why. \n \n You said:\n Nonsense. That is your prejudice talking.\n \n And:\n Well, it might seem apparent to you, but it is just your subjective conditioning. You have been conditioned by the society you're in.. but .. so far, you have just used on unsupported claim after another.\n \n The bolded parts were the ad hominem attacks, the underlined were the argument by dismissal.\n \n Although you did say why you believed you could dismiss my arguments it is not universally accepted that I have made unsupported claims, therefore you must find and demonstrate that my claims are unsupported. (most efficiently by finding one of my statement and asking what the support was.)\n \n \nThe 'Knowledge of what is right and wrong' is subjective, based on individual beliefs, and on the needs of society. Ethics are subjective.. and basically are just a bunch of social behavior needed for the smooth interactions between people. \n\n I consider this an unsupported claim, what is the support trebor?\n \n \nI have yet to say you are wrong because you are .xxxx.\n\n You have claimed I am wrong because of bias and because of societal conditioning.\n \n \nI have shown you are making unsupported claims\n\n Then you should post it, I can't read your mind.\n \nand this is also known as a 'distraction'.. red herring.. \n \n Try to keept hings short and to the point, and not wander every place.\n\n If you feel distracted by me pointing out your fallacies I will ignore them.\n \nWhat specific question do you want answered, Do it two at a time.\n\n First the question I asked above, do you agree with the statement.\n \n Second do you believe it's proper for you to be the one who decides what you value, what you think is good, and what you think is evil?\n \n \nNope.. you are wrong. Do try to understand what an ad homenin is. \n\n See above, and if you think you can evade the definitions of these fallacies do so.\n \n \nI am having trouble about what you are saying 'logically' blah blah blah, because that is not the case.. you are making a subjective and unsupported claim there.\n\n Your counter argument is truly brilliant trebor....",

   "Then state the non-legal parts so we can continue the argument.\n\n \n I will get back to that I don't want to mix \n \n \nThat's your dilemma, so how do you solve it?\n\n \n No, it is a response to your comment. It's your dliemma. My position has no problem answering yours though is probably why you want to make it mine.\n \n \nIt is objectively true that there is an agreement not that what is being agreed upon is objectively true.\n\n \n I know\n \n \nIf 10 people agree chocolate tastes good it is still a subjective matter as there is no standard but the consensus.\n \n As you have implied before your solution to those who don't think choclate tastes good is to ignore them because they are the minority. That is fine but you cannot claim that because most people like choclate these people MUST as well\n.\n \n I don't. It's subjective remember. \n \n The objective position would deny the existence of the minority or hold that they just didn't know they were wrong. One day though....\n \n \nIf science was objective how could a truth be understood to be false and then be changed to be understood as scientifically true?\n\n \n If science was what we were talking about you would have a good answer, but in both cases it isn't\n \n \nJust as there was no reason to doubt that the sun revolved around the earth, the world was flat, and witches float (like ducks).\n \n Except there were reasons, in hindsight there were clues but the danger laid in assuming they already had the answers and so no further inquiry was required.\n\n \n Or these were subjective observations that were not universally accepted.\n \n \nWhat we observe when looking at the past in 20/20 is that our formal logic is correct, that at no point in anyone's history could logical deduction yield incorrect conclusions no matter how little evidence there was.\n\n \n The implication is that objective understanding is only possible in the present regarding the past. The present regarding the future may show objective thought in the past or present regarding the future may be wrong. Meaning nothing objective can be known objectively.\n \n \nWhat I see when I consider examples like that one is that there were once people who thought something was moral when it was not. This only drives home the point that personal or collective whim is insufficient and invalid on this matter (and all others if I had my way).\n\n \n Would we know what bad is if there was no good or is everything just degrees of the same. \n \n \nIf laws are based on a subjective value then laws must be themselves subjective.\n\n \n They are. But that doesn't mean they lack authority or can last for meaningful periods of time. You keep subtly implying that laws being subjective have neither. That is not true.\n \n \nA series of premises.\n\n \n Assumptions\n \n \nIt is good since it is true, i.e. it is impossible for immoral to equal true because the immoral is that based on falsehood.\n\n \n Replace good with true, same question.\n \n \nSo let me get this straight none of these absurd conclusions seem incorrect to you in any way?\n\n \n No. I don't disagree with the conclusions so much as I disagree with the assumptions that you base the conclusions on. If I were in agreement with your initial statements then I could see the validity of your position. \n \n \nIt seems my idea of absurd conclusions aren't your idea of absurd conclusions.\n\n \n Would it help if I said your conclusion were absurd?\n \n \nMaybe there is hope for you pappillion :)\n\n \n Hopefully that is objective\n \n \nBut a bear is not subject to objective morality while the murderer or thief is.\n \n\n \n But the bear was funny. Not him eating you, but trying to explain to the bear the morality of it actions and your right to your person as being superior to it's hunger. \n \n \nYou seemed to take offense at none of these conclusions. I want you to say it explicitly to be sure.\n\n \n Did you intend them to be offensive?\n \n \nLaws must be based on the governments will not morality.\n\n \n Laws must be based on the will of the people and maintained by the government.\n \n \nIt is my personal opinion that the Nazi's were evil, but there is no good reason my neighbor to believe that.\n\n \n They were why isn't my reason good enough for my neighbor?\n \n \nThe authority of government exists only because of its military power, if it was a pacifist organization it's laws would be invalid.\n\n \n That is true in some places, but not all.\n \n \nThat is fundamentally different from your baseless claim that objective morality would lead to an inefficient society.\n\n \n And your overwhelming evidence that it would is what?\n \n \nOh and killing another person isn't objectively immoral murder is.\n\n \n Kill, execute, murder all mean to deprive of life. Kill is the general word, with no implication of the manner of killing, the agent or cause, or the nature of what is killed (whether human being, animal, or plant): to kill a person. Execute is used with reference to the putting to death of one in accordance with a legal sentence, no matter what the means are: to execute a criminal. Murder is used of killing a human being unlawfully: He murdered him for his money.  \n \n Can you respond to the point of the statement or do I need to explain in detail?\n \n \nIf you think the question is valid then you still do not understand what objective morality is. (no surprise)\n\n \n Well maybe that is a good place to start. How do you define it? In simple terms.\n \n \nI have objective facts; no objective conclusions can be reached with subjective premises.\n\n \n How do you have objective fact without subjective methods?\n \n \nIn fact subjective statements are themselves fallacies and do not exist.\n\n \n All men born in odd months believe that.

(still on the premise of subjective morality here)\n \n Unless as I pointed out you are militarist (I think I just made that word up).\n \n militarist - Someone who holds the threat of force as the primary premise of human interaction.\n \n If you were a militarist you would not think that something is wrong for one person because most people think it's wrong; you would be content to observe that no matter what is right or wrong for him, if society has more military power they are going to force their will on him.\n \n \nThe objective position would deny the existence of the minority....\n\n Only a false objective position could make a claim about subjective values without the subject as qualifier.\n \n \nIf science was what we were talking about you would have a good answer, but in both cases it isn't\n\n Red Herring\n \n \nOr these were subjective observations that were not universally accepted.\n\n Explain\n \n \n \nThe implication is that objective understanding is only possible in the present regarding the past. \n\n I don't see that implication, elaborate.\n \n \nMeaning nothing objective can be known objectively.\n\n I believe this is a plain old non-sequitur.\n \n \n \nWould we know what bad is if there was no good\n\n I believe the boolean is the simplest datatype, so no we would not know what bad is without good neither would have definition.\n \n \n \nThey are. But that doesn't mean they lack authority or can last for meaningful periods of time. You keep subtly implying that laws being subjective have neither.

How do you define it? In simple terms.\n\n Well we probably should have started with this. As you know I have not been using the normal definitions of the term of morality, I have added a qualifier \"In social interactions\". The reason for this is simple: That is the only sphere we need to agree on.\n \n Morality - of, pertaining to, or concerned with the principles or rules of right conduct or the distinction between right and wrong; ethical: moral attitudes. \n \n Objective Morality - of, pertaining to, or concerned with the principles or rules of right conduct or the distinction between right and wrong that can be determined from any perspective via logical evaluation of facts.\n \n To ask \"on whose authority is this moral?\" Is to ask \"On whose authority does logic function?\"\n \n Right and wrong in social interactions can be determined on the principle of liberty which can be derived from the nature of man. (I have done that already just look)\n \n \nHow do you have objective fact without subjective methods?\n\n Logic is not a subjective method.\n \n \nAll men born in odd months believe that. Subjective\n\n That was a universal statement, if it is not true (which it certainly is not) it is a false universal statement.\n \n If tagging on the term 'subjective' means that the truth or falsity changes based on the subject (as I believe the word means) then it is a false statement for all subjective statements are false.\n \n \nYou believe that subjective statements are a fallacy. Objective\n\n Indeed.\n \nSince subjective is necessary to prove objective also if that were so, very little would be disagreed upon\n\n I have no idea what that means.\n \n \nNo, that you care enough to disagree or that you care period.\n\n I reject the implied premise that the only reason I would disagree with you is that I feel I should.\n \n \nMorality will always have an emotional bias in what is and is not moral.\n\n \nI am proof that is not true.\n\n \nHow is one who claims not to have emotions\n\n \nFind where I claimed that. \n\n \n So tell me, how is it deductively proven that the only way to avoid emotional bias is to not have emotions?",

The PBS samples Qi-treated by the Qi-gong master and by one of the Qi-gong trainees showed clear stimulation of PMN phagocytic activity which was significant statistically, and this phenomenon was highly reproducible. Out of 10 experiments by the Qi-gong master, only twice did Qi-treatment fail to influence the PBS. The activity of Qi-treated PBS decayed over days or weeks. Furthermore, it was found that Qi-treated PBS had decreased phagocytic stimulatory activity after microwave treatment, but not after autoclave treatment. We also demonstrated that microwave irradiation and infrared laser pulse irradiation have similar effects on PBS as Qi- treatment. The results obtained in this experiment provide evidence of the existence of Qi energy, its ability to influence an electrolyte solution and its biological effect. Furthermore, microwave or infrared laser pulse treatment was found to partly mimic the Qi-treatment of...'\n Evidence of Qi-gong Energy and its Biological Effect on the Enhancement of the Phagocytic Activity of Human Polymorphonuclear Leukocytes | American Journal of Chinese Medicine | Find Articles at BNET\n \n Communism is another thread.emoticon_rolleyes\n I still say my Religious/Post-hypnotic Suggestion Theory is right on the money. ;)\n\n \n Okay I give up:)emoticon_xgood",
