   "Europeans accused in Iraq report\n From CNN Senior Producer Phil Hirschkorn\n Thursday, May 12, 2005 Posted: 0810 GMT (1610 HKT) \n \n NEW YORK (CNN) -- A U.S. congressional committee probing the defunct U.N. oil-for-food program in Iraq alleges that two politicians from Britain and France personally received millions of dollars worth of oil allocations from Saddam Hussein's regime. \n \n Both men have previously denied the allegations.\n \n A report released Thursday by the Senate Government Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations asserted that Charles Pasqua, a former French interior minister in charge of law enforcement and an ally of President Jacques Chirac, and George Galloway, a just-reelected member of British Parliament, each were granted millions of barrels of oil allocations by Hussein to thank them for their positions in favor of loosening economic sanctions against Iraq.\n \n snip\n \n http://edition.cnn.com/2005/LAW/05/12/senate.oilforfood/index.html\n \n BARF! Is anyone surprised? As I thought all along.",
