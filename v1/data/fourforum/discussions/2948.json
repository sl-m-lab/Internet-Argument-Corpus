I don't have a problem with someone altering their stance over a long period of time, but when Kerry changes his mind in 1 year and decides to go to the totally opposite pole, it makes me think it's for political reasons. And he has done this on more than one occasion. (1)Iraq (he has actually had I think 3 different stances on it, and when the time calls for it, he changes to the appropriate theme), (2)the whole Cambodia issue (wait, was that a flip flop or did he get caught in a lie?), (3)Patriot Act, (4)double taxation, and (5)providing for the safety of our troops in Iraq. Look closely at the dates!!\n \n \n (1)\"George, I said at the time I would have preferred if we had given diplomacy a greater opportunity, but I think it was the right decision to disarm Saddam Hussein, and when the President made the decision, I supported him, and I support the fact that we did disarm him.\" (ABC News, Democrat Presidential Candidate Debate, Columbia, SC, 5/4/03)\n \n \"I voted to threaten the use of force to make Saddam Hussein comply with the resolutions of the United Nations.\" (Sen. John Kerry, Remarks At Announcement Of Presidential Candidacy, Mount Pleasant, SC, 9/2/03)\n \n \"Do you think you belong to that category of candidates who more or less are unhappy with this war, the way it's been fought, along with General Clark, along with Howard Dean and not necessarily in companionship politically on the issue of the war with people like Lieberman, Edwards and Gephardt? Are you one of the anti-war candidates?\" KERRY: \"I am -- Yes, in the sense that I don't believe the president took us to war as he should have, yes, absolutely.\" (9/15/03)\n \n \n That only took him 9 months to completely change his mind.\n \n But now he says he would have invaded Iraq, knowing what we know now. Is that 3 or 4 flip flops?\n \n \n \n (2)\"I remember Christmas of 1968, sitting on a gunboat in Cambodia. I remember what it was like to be shot at by the Vietnamese and the Khmer Rouge and Cambodians, and the president of the United States telling the American people I was not there; the troops were not in Cambodia. I have that memory which is seared -- seared -- in me.\" Kerry had told this dramatic story before, in the Boston Herald, Oct. 14, 1979, with a different twist as to who had fired on the young Navy lieutenant on that unforgettable Christmas Eve. \"On more than one occasion, I, like Martin Sheen in Apocalypse Now, took my patrol boat into Cambodia. In fact, I remember spending Christmas Eve of 1968 five miles across the Cambodian border being shot at by our South Vietnamese allies who were drunk and celebrating Christmas. The absurdity of almost being killed by our own allies in a country in which President Nixon claimed there were no American troops was very real.\"\n \n First, because Richard Nixon was not president on Christmas Eve, 1968. Lyndon Johnson was. More critically, because Kerry's fellow Swift Boat commanders are openly accusing him of lying. \n \n \"John Kerry has said on the record that he had a mistaken recollection earlier. He talked about a combat situation on Christmas Eve 1968 which at one point he said occurred in Cambodia. He has since corrected the record to say it was some place on a river near Cambodia and he is certain that at some point subsequent to that he was in Cambodia. My understanding is that he is not certain about that date.\" \n \n Obviously the memory wasn't seered in his memory if he completely forgot about it?\n \n \n \n (3)The Patriot Act was passed nearly unanimously by the Senate 98-1, and 357-66 in the House. (H.R. 3162, CQ Vote #313: Passed 98-1: R 49-0; D 48-1; I 1-0, 10/25/01, Kerry Voted Yea)\n \n \"Most of [The Patriot Act] has to do with improving the transfer of information between CIA and FBI, and it has to do with things that really were quite necessary in the wake of what happened on September 11th.\" (Sen. John Kerry, Remarks At Town Hall Meeting, Manchester, NH, 8/6/03)\n \n \"We are a nation of laws and liberties, not of a knock in the night. So it is time to end the era of John Ashcroft. That starts with replacing the Patriot Act with a new law that protects our people and our liberties at the same time. I've been a District Attorney and I know that what law enforcement needs are real tools not restrictions on American's basic rights.\" (Sen. John Kerry, Remarks At Iowa State University, 12/1/03)\n \n Only 4 months this time!!!\n \n \n \n (4)\"[T]o encourage investments in the jobs of the future - I think we should eliminate the tax on capital gains for investments in critical technology companies - zero capital gains on $100 million issuance of stock if it's held for 5 years and has created real jobs. And we should attempt to end the double taxation of dividends.\" (Sen. John Kerry, Remarks At The City Club Of Cleveland, 12/3/02) \n \n \"Kerry also reiterated his opposition to the Republican plan to cut taxes on stock dividends. 'This is not the time for a dividends tax cut that goes to individuals,' he said.\" (\"Kerry Says Time Is On Dems' Side,\" The Associated Press, 5/8/03)\n \n \n Time to flip flop=5 months!!!\n \n \n \n (5)\"Do you believe that we should reduce funding that we are now providing for the operation in Iraq?\" SEN. JOHN KERRY: \"No. I think we should increase it.\" RUSSERT: \"Increase funding?\" KERRY: \"Yes.\" RUSSERT: \"By how much?\" KERRY: \"By whatever number of billions of dollars it takes to win. It is critical that the United States of America be successful in Iraq, Tim.\" (NBC's \"Meet The Press,\" 8/31/03)\n \n Kerry Later Claimed: \"I Actually Did Vote For The $87 Billion Before I Voted Against It.\" (Glen Johnson, \"Kerry Blasts Bush On Protecting Troops,\" The Boston Globe, 3/17/04)\n \n \n 7 month flip flop time!!!\n \n \n \n \n \n \nBUSH OPPOSES NATION BUILDING... \"If we don't stop extending our troops all around the world in nation-building missions, then we're going to have a serious problem coming down the road.\" [Gov. George W.

That's what caused Bush to abandon his policy of staying out of other countries' affairs. We had to go to Afghanistan to search for the man who terrorized America, and we had to invade Iraq because they posed a threat to everyone.\n \n \n \nBUSH SAYS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEEN AL QAEDA AND SADDAM... \"You can't distinguish between al Qaeda and Saddam when you talk about the war on terror.\" [President Bush, 9/25/02]\n \n ...BUSH SAYS SADDAM HAD NO ROLE IN AL QAEDA PLOT \"We've had no evidence that Saddam Hussein was involved in Sept. 11.\" [President Bush, 9/17/03]\n\n \n \n Did you even read the first statement? It doesn't even accuse Saddam of having links to 9/11. The first one said there was a link between Saddam and Al Qaeda, not Saddam and 9/11, which there was. Why did you even try to use this one as your argument?",

Look closely at the dates!! \n\n Actually, you and the Bushies HAVE been hitting Kerry for \"flipflops\" that occured well over a 4 year period. For example, Kerry's \"proposed 50 cent gas tax hike\" was over a decade ago, but that didn't stop the Bush campaign from putting on its website. The last time Kerry voted in favor of Yucca Mountain was 1997 (7 years ago) but that didn't stop a whole thread from being devoted to it on this board (although Bush flipflopped on it in the space of 2 years).\n \n Now, let's take these one at a time:\n 1) The Iraq war:\n I don't see any flipflop at all. What I do see is a position that closely mirrors my own. I supported the war in Iraq, and I still do, in principle (statements 1,2 and 4). However, I think that President Bush seriously screwed up on the specifics and thus made the war more costly, less likely to succeed, and more apt to cause the US serious foreign policy repurcussions down the road than it had to be. That's what Kerry was saying in statment 3 when he said \"Yes, in the sense that I don't believe the president took us to war as he should have , yes, absolutely.\" A big reason why I'm against President Bush is that the Iraq war represented such an important oppurtunity to further a plethora of important US foreign policy goals (from humaniterean intervention to a more muscular foreign policy), and by screwing it up he managed to discredit all of them in the global eye. That's an unforgivable lapse in judgment.\n \n 2 is irrelevant because its not a policy stance. Its a misstatement of his war record. And having an event \"seared into his memory\" does not mean he remembers every detail about his surroundings. When he says \"seared\" in I'm guessing he's talking about the dying and killing and gunfire, not the coordinates on his map. There are plenty of events I'd consider \"seared\" into to my mind where I couldn't tell you plenty of details. But alas, I'm taking the bait here. I've been very consistent that we should judge the candidates based on policy and policy proposals. This has nothing to do with that.\n \n 3 is a \"flip flop\" in the strictist sense of the term, I suppose. But its a good example about why we shouldn't be so quick to lambast the term. With the exception of Sen. Russ Feingold (much credit to him, btw), all the Senators were scared, they wanted quick action, and they made a bad vote. To be sure, MOST of the Patriot Act isn't that bad. But some of the stuff (esp. the Article II provisions) is dangerous and should not be part of our system. Kerry said mea culpa, and I'll leave it at that. Better than the man who can't ever admit he made a mistake.\n \n 4 is so silly I'm surprised YOU brought it up. Kerry made a specific proposal to exempt capital gains laws from certain critical industries. That is very different from a $700 billion dollar bill to get rid of them in all cases. As for the dividend tax, look to the rhetoric Sen. Kerry uses. \"This is not the time\" for the dividend cut. Even if we should \"try to eliminate\" the dividend taxation (which is all Kerry said originally), there's a time and place for it, and $400 billion in the red is the wrong time.\n \n 5 I think that vote was a mistake, and I'll say so flat out. However, Kerry did make numerous votes to increase the money flowing to Iraq aside from that one vote not to. Was that vote a bad vote? Sure it was. Chalk up one negative thing for Kerry.\n \n Now move to ure defense of Bush's flipflops. I agree with the invasion of Afghanistan, but so did virtually every other democrat so that's irrelevant. Your statement on Iraq (and this comes from a war supporter) is frankly inaccurate. Not only was Iraq not a threat to anyone outside of the region, but there was never ANY doubt that it could cause harm to the United States. Even if it did have WMD's, it didn't have the capacity to deliver them to the United States (it doesn't have the missile technology). Claims that it might give the WMD tech to al-Qaeda also were faulty, Iraq's SECULAR baathist government if anything was an enemy to al-qaeda's religious based ideology. Hussein knew that anything he gave to al-qaeda could very easily be thrown right back at him. Of course, intelligence analysts did outline one scenario where Hussien would give his WMD's to al-qaeda: In the event of a US invasion where Hussein didn't have anything to lose anymore and just wanted to inflict maximum hurt on the United States. So maybe you're right, Hussein had the WMD's and they are just \"missing\" in a tora bora cave right now.\n \n Also, this statement contradicts your defense of his second \"flipflop.\" If 9/11 justified invaded Iraq (when his old doctrine wouldn't have it), then clearly Bush was creating an internal link between 9/11 (not just Al-qaeda) and the Iraqi regime (of course, you could just read former Bush counter-terrorism czar Richard Clarke's book to tell you that). So his later disavowal of that connection was a paradigm shift.",

They could have brought them over here and used them on us. Saddam did meet with Al Qaeda and Bin Laden. Read the 9/11 Commission Report. It flat out says that Saddam sent messengers to bring Bin Laden to Iraq to meet with him",

   "Maybe you didn't read my post. I showed Kerry's major flip flops, all being within a years time. I didn't mention anything about his gas tax hike or Yucca. I pointed out his major flip flops. \n\n I'm just pointing out how the Bush campaign is being disingenious with this issue, bringing up votes that wouldn't fit in within your own framework. The Yucca Mt. vote was brought up by your lovely ally on this board, Jim's Trucking (the \"has kerry lost his memory\" thread)\n \n \n How do you not see a flip flop? He first votes to go to war, then says he wouldn't have gone to war. He recently stated that knowing what we know no, that he would have in fact went to war. If you don't see that as a flip flop, you're either blind and/or dumb. Maybe Bush did screw up, but I said Kerry flip flopped. Bush has been consistent with the war in Iraq.

I would much rather have a President who stands by what he says, and doesn't change his mind just to influence the public. \n\n But Kerry never said he wouldn't have gone to war. What he did say (this is the bolded portion of the quote) was that he was anti-war in the sense that the war was handled in the wrong way (call it anti-war-as-applied), which is a reasonable sentiment and one that I share as someone who was in favor of the war. Your own quotes undermine your position.\n \n How is it irrelevant? I didn't say all of his escapades were political. If it's not a flip flop, it's a lie. I think if the memory was seared into his brain, he would at least know which country it was. The whole Vietnam basically is Kerry's policy, in a loose sense.

I guess he's afraid of flip flopping again, so he doesn't want to say anything yet. \n\n You're absolutely right, if you're going to assign a negative value judgment to this ordeal, then \"lie\" would be far more accurate than \"flipflop.\" But when your in the middle of a warzone, and the closest landmark is Cambodia (in a river near cambodia), you can be forgiven for saying you were \"in Cambodia\" (its not like there are signs posted all over. you cross the border from vietnam to cambodia and suddenly the jungle shifts to...jungle).\n That being said, what's the controversy here? Its not like Kerry misstated that he had sex with small children. He mislabeled a location. Oh horrors upon horrors!\n Finally, though I am a pessimist with regards to Kerry, I think there is a BIT more to his campaign than just \"I served in Vietnam.\" To the extent I've seen them, his policy proposals look pretty strong.\n \n A bad vote is a vote, nontheless. If you vote to go to war because our country gets nuked (meaning you voted because you were scraed and wanted quick action), that is no excuse to blow off your vote like that. \n\n Fine, it was a bad vote. In times of crisis, its often necessary to take quick action. The president and attorney general said this bill was necessary to conduct our war on terror, and we believed them. When the sense of urgency died down abit, its proper (and i'd say obligatory) to re-examine what was authorized and see if its just.\n \n How is it silly? He first said he wanted to get rid of double taxation on dividends, then he said he opposed the Republicans' dividend tax cut? \n\n <sigh< it would be nice if you at least made a perfunctory effort to answer what I'm writing here. I made two arguments for why the inclusion was silly\n 1) Support for localized elimination of the capital gains tax should not be read as support for its elimination in all cases\n 2) The general sentiment \"we should try to eliminate double taxation of dividends\" doesn't mean that every time is the right time. When we're in a giant deficit, that's the WRONG time to go after that particular item on the wishlist.\n Contrary to what you might believe, sometimes a change in circumstances WARRANTS a change in belief. I'd have been far more willing to support a comprehensive healthcare proposal when we were carrying a $400 billion dollar surplus then today when we're facing a staggering debt. That's called common sense. Similarly, a rapidly deteriorating budget picture makes Kerry's decision to put off eliminating dividend taxes an example of fiscal responsibilty.\n \n How can you vote to go to war, and then not vote to give amor and safety to your troops there? That's just pretty ridiculous if you ask me. You send 100s of thousands of troops over there, and then you don't protect them. That's pretty sad. \n\n Quite right. It is pretty sad. Of course, as Kerry has reminded us so many times, there was an alternate plan on the table to fund our troops that commanded bipartisan support. So why did Republicans try and play politics with a bill to support the troops and instead front one that garnered democratic opposition? That's pretty sad too. I oppose the politicization of necessary military and security measures in all cases, whether its the Iraqi Reconstruction Bill or the Republican's cynical manipulation of the Department of Homeland Security for political gain.\n \n Iraq didn't have to have the capacity to deliver it to the US. They could have easily given it to a terrorist or another country who could have used it. Use your brain. Saddam had been meeting with Al Qaeda, so who's to say he wouldn't have given them any nukes? They could have brought them over here and used them on us. Saddam did meet with Al Qaeda and Bin Laden. Read the 9/11 Commission Report. It flat out says that Saddam sent messengers to bring Bin Laden to Iraq to meet with him \n\n Actually, what the 9/11 report says is that Saddam TRIED to intiate contacts with al-qaeda, but was rebuffed. Thus, the report concludes, they had \"no collaberative relationship.\" Hence your scenario falls, and mine kicks in.",

Look at page 66. Bin Laden actually contacted Saddam, so you were wrong. Bin Laden first contacted Saddam, and then Saddam contacted Bin Laden. That's a connection, if you ask me.\n \n \n \n \"In March 1998, after Bin Laden's public fatwa against the US, 2 al Qaeda members reportedly went to Iraq to meet with Iraqi intelligence. in July, an Iraqi delegation traveled to Afghanistan to meet first with the Taliban and then with Bin Laden.\"\n \n \"Similar meetings between Iraqi officials and Bin Laden or hsi aides may have occurred in 1999 during a period of reported strains with the Taliban, According to the reporting, Iraqi officials offered Bin Laden a safe haven in Iraq.\"\n \n \n Look it up.

   "Dude, do you even READ what I write?\n 1) The Post article was a news story, not an editorial\n 2) IT WAS QUOTING THE 9/11 REPORT!!!!\n I'll put it in nice bold letters so you don't miss it this time:\n \"'There have been reports that contacts between Iraq and al Qaeda also occurred after bin Laden had returned to Afghanistan [in 1996], but they do not appear to have resulted in a collaborative relationship,' the report says. \" (The report refering to the 9/11 report. In case you're going to go into paranoia mode and believe the Post just made it up, the statement quoted comes from page 66 of the Report).\n \n The difference between \"trying to hook up with the terrorists and failing\" and \"having a collaberative relationship\" is significant.\n \n The latter makes Iraq party to a significant threat to the United States. Whether its strong enough to justify a preventative invasion is up for debate, but it very much strengthens the argument in favor.\n The former (IE, the truth) means that Saddam is...a really bad guy who hates America and wants us to die. 1) No one ever seriously disputed that 2) It doesn't make him fundamentally different than the regimes in Iran, Syria, North Korea, Sudan, most of the Pakistani government (esp. the ISI which has at least as much sway over the government as Gen. Musharref does), Libya, Serbia, or Cuba (to name a few). Furthermore, since we generally don't invade people just because they WISH bad things would happen to us (otherwise we'd be marching through Paris by now), it makes the only plausable reason to invade Iraq huminetarian in motive. I'm cool with that (in fact, its why I was pro-war in the first place). But it means that we have as much of an obligation to intervene in North Korea, Sudan, Liberia, and the Congo, and that's a troop commitment I doubt you're willing to make.\n In foreign policy, capability matters, and the conclusion of the 9/11 report was that Iraq had not entered into a relationship with al-qaeda that could have resulted in them getting the capability to harm us.\n \n And now that I look back, the statement YOU quoted to ME came from page 66 of the report. So you should have read the statement that I quoted back to you (indeed, my quote was at the bottom of the paragraph that starts with one of your quotes). As such, your professed skeptism of the phrase being in the report(and false allegations of me quoting an \"editorial\") are\n a) Phenomonally dishonest on your part\n b) Probably indicative of you using selective quoting when crafting your argument.\n \n That's very unfortunate. These discussions are entered into with at least a baseline assumption of the particpants abiding by minimal standards of intellectual honesty. The violation of that trust is deeply disappointing and I'm afraid will color any other assertions of fact you make with twinges of doubt.\n \n I may be \"typical of a democrat,\" but at least I present my views honestly and make a good faith effort to respond to the points brought up by others.
