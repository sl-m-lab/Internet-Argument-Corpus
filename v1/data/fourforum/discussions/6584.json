The alternative may be worse. We know he had a copy of the UN weapons ispectors reports when he made the decision, we know he fixed the intel. If he did not lie, what he DID do was completely and totally ignore all the intel that we had that was even marginally reliable, instead relying on intel that had been shown as unreliable, and launched us on a trillion dollar crusade. The poor judgement that shows is possibly more dangerous than having a liar in the whitehouse. What it coems down to is that the guy is either a liar, or an idiot. I would rather he be a liar. President of the United states is too important a position ot have an idiot there.\n \n \n Then during the 2004 election we started to notice that no one running was worth a darn.

Things like tort reform look great, until people relaiuze that you really cannot do it without putting the American public wholly at the mercy of big business. His prescription drug plan sounded great, until the price tag came along, and it looked even worse once it ws discovered that those who drafted it essentially conspired with drug manufacturers, who raised prices when the new plan went into effect. In many cases, the end user is paying the exact sdame amount for their prescription, PLUS the taxpayer is kickign in quite a bit. It turned out to be nothing but a big give away to pharmaceutical companies.\n \n The problem is that he ran on a platform of special interests and corporate greed. The Americna public, not beign the sharpest tools in the shed, take a while to figure such things out. These things that sounded good as comapingn sound bytes are almost impossible to sell when they are actually out in the open, with all the down sides revealed.\n \n \n He then said he would appoint people like Scalia and Thomas (who are smart guys even if you don't like them) and he almost did with Roberts but failed with Miers...and that was it. \n \n \n Failed with Miers?

Every nation ont eh planet was actively hunting down and detaining Al Queda members or members of any organization even remotely connected to Al Queda. Now all that has stopped. the rest of the world seems to have decided to let us go to hell ourr own way. The only real ally we have left whio is willing to actively supprot us is the british, and even they are not the good lap dogs they once were int eh face of torture scadals and illegal detainments.\n \n I should have read your message more completely and I would have realised form the start that you are a religous wack job and unworthy of a reply.",
