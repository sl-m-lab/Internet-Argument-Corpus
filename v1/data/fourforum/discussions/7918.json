   "Biblical and Early Church Fathers Evidences for Authority of Roman Catholic Church as One True Church of Christ.\n \n First off we are the Oldest Christian Denomination harking back to the time of the Apostles\n \n Second all other Christian denominations directly or indirectly come from the Roman Catholic Church\n \n Third if all denominations hail from the RCC and The Roman Catholic Church is not the one true church then no Church is or Can be... but Christ said \"Upon this Rock I will build my Church and the gates of hell shall not prevail\" that means his church will not fail fall or cease to be... it must exist.\n \n The Church  \n \n The Roman Catholic Church and its Members in full Communion with Rome\n \n 16 Simon Peter replied, \"You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.\" 17 And Jesus answered him, \"Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jona! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. 18 And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. \n \n 17 If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. 18 Truly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\n \n 18 And Jesus came and said to them, \"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 19 Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, to the close of the age.\"\n \n 15 And he said to them, \"Go into all the world and preach the gospel to the whole creation. 16 He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned\n \n 16 And I will pray to the Father, and he will give you another Counselor, to be with you forever, \n \n 26 But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you.\n \n 13 When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come.\n \n 15 if I am delayed, you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and bulwark of the truth.\n \n The Church as The Body of Christ Including Our Seperated Brethern  \n \n 18 He is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning, the first-born from the dead, that in everything he might be pre-eminent.\n \n 20 As it is, there are many parts, yet one body. 21 The eye cannot say to the hand, \"I have no need of you,\" nor again the head to the feet, \"I have no need of you.\" 22 On the contrary, the parts of the body which seem to be weaker are indispensable, 23 and those parts of the body which we think less honorable we invest with the greater honor, and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty, 24 which our more presentable parts do not require. But God has so composed the body, giving the greater honor to the inferior part, 25 that there may be no discord in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another. 26 If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all rejoice together.\n \n 30 because we are members of his body.\n \n 4 For as in one body we have many members, and all the members do not have the same function, 5 so we, though many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another.\n \n 15 Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I therefore take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Never!\n \n The Apostolic Church and the Body of Christ Must Be One/ United\n \n 16 And I have other sheep, that are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they will heed my voice. So there shall be one flock, one shepherd.\n \n 3 eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. 4 There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to the one hope that belongs to your call, 5 one Lord, one faith, one baptism, 6 one God and Father of us all, who is above all and through all and in all.\n \n 17 I appeal to you, brethren, to take note of those who create dissensions and difficulties, in opposition to the doctrine which you have been taught; avoid them.\n \n 10 I appeal to you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree and that there be no dissensions among you, but that you be united in the same mind and the same judgment.\n \n 2 complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind.\n \n 5 May the God of steadfastness and encouragement grant you to think in such harmony with one another, in accord with Christ Jesus.\n 17 Sanctify them in the truth; thy word is truth. 18 As thou didst send me into the world, so I have sent them into the world. 19 And for their sake I consecrate myself, that they also may be consecrated in truth. \n 20 \"I do not pray for these only, but also for those who believe in me through their word, 21 that they may all be one; even as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. 22 The glory which thou hast given me I have given to them, that they may be one even as we are one\n 23 I in them and thou in me, that they may become perfectly one, so that the world may know that thou hast sent me and hast loved them even as thou hast loved me.\n \n 13 For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body--Jews or Greeks, slaves or free--and all were made to drink of one Spirit.\n \n 5 so we, though many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another.\n \n 4 There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to the one hope that belongs to your call,\n \n 15 And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in the one body. And be thankful.\n \n Early Church Fathers: On Catholic Unity\n \n St Cyprian\n \n \"God is One, and Christ is One , and One is his Church , and the faith is One and his people welded together by the glue of concord into a solid unity of body. Unity cannot be rent asunder , nor can the one body of the church, through the division of its structure be divided into separate pieces.\n \n Tertullian\n \n \"We are a society with a single religious feeling, a single unity of discipline, a single bond of hope\"\n \n St Hillary\n \n \"In the scriptures our people are shown to be made one, so that just as many grains collected into one and ground and mingled together make one loaf, so in Christ, who is heaveny bread , we know our whole body is joined and united\"\n \n Apostolic Church & Hierarchical System\n \n Special Men Chosen and Appointed\n \n 16 You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide; so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you.\n \n Special Men Chosen and Appointed to carry on Christ's Mission\n \n 21 Jesus said to them again, \"Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, even so I send you.\"\n \n Special Men Chosen and Appointed to carry on Christ's mission and also Given a Kingdom to look After\n \n 29 and I assign to you, as my Father assigned to me, a kingdom, 30 that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.\n \n Special Men chosen and Appointed to carry on Christs Mission and also Given a Kingdom to look after, that Kingdom is the Church\n \n 18 And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.\n \n Special Men chosen and Appointed to carry on Christs Mission and also Given a Kingdom to look after, that Kingdom is the Church and One Shepherd shall be appointed to Look after Christ's Sheep\n \n 16 And I have other sheep, that are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they will heed my voice. So there shall be one flock, one shepherd.\n \n \n Special Men chosen and Appointed to carry on Christs Mission and also Given a Kingdom to look after, that Kingdom is the Church and One \"Shepherd\" shall be appointed to Look after Christ's Sheep, Peter is Called to be the chief Shepherd.\n \n 32 but I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail; and when you have turned again, strengthen your brethren 15 When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, \"Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?\" He said to him, \"Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.\" He said to him, \"Feed my lambs.\" 16 A second time he said to him, \"Simon, son of John, do you love me?\" He said to him, \"Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.\" He said to him, \"Tend my sheep.\" 17 He said to him the third time, \"Simon, son of John, do you love me?\" Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, \"Do you love me?\" And he said to him, \"Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you.\" Jesus said to him, \"Feed my sheep.\n \n Special Men chosen and Appointed to carry on Christ's Mission and also Given a Kingdom to look after that Kingdom is the Church and One \"Shepherd\" is to Look after Christ's Sheep Peter is Called to be the chief Shepherd of a Hierarchical Church\n \n 11 And his gifts were that some should be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers.\n \n Special Men chosen and Appointed to carry on Christ's Mission and also Given a Kingdom to look after that Kingdom is the Church and One \"Shepherd\" is to Look after Christ's Sheep Peter is Called to be the chief Shepherd of a Hierarchical Church of Bishops, Priests (Preachers) and Deacons\n \n 1 The saying is sure: If any one aspires to the office of bishop, he desires a noble task.\n \n 17 Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in preaching and teaching;\n \n 8 Deacons likewise must be serious, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not greedy for gain;\n \n Special Men chosen and Appointed to carry on Christ's Mission and also Given a Kingdom to look after that Kingdom is the Church and One \"Shepherd\" is to Look after Christ's Sheep Peter is Called to be the chief Shepherd of a Hierarchical Church of Bishops, Priests (elders) and Deacons, The Bishops are to ordain priests\n \n 5 This is why I left you in Crete, that you might amend what was defective, and appoint elders in every town as I directed you, \n \n Authoritative Church\n \n Jesus delegates power to Apostals\n \n 18 And Jesus came and said to them, \"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 19 Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, to the close of the age.\"\n \n Jesus delegates power to Apostles including Power to Forgive sins\n \n \n 23 If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.\"\n \n Jesus delegates power to Apostles including Power to... Forgive sins, offer Sacrafice of Eucharist\n \n 23 For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, 24 and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, \"This is my body which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.\"\n \n Jesus delegates power to Apostles including Power to...

But if he doesn't pay attention even to the church, let him be like an unbeliever and a tax collector to you.\n \n Saints & Early Church Fathers On Authoritative Church:\n \n St Irenaeus\n \n \"The Church, having received this preaching and this faith, although she is disseminated throughout the whole world, yet guarded it, as if she occupied but one house [with Christ]. She likewise believes these things just as if she had but one soul and one and the same heart [as Christ], and harmoniously she proclaims them and teaches them and hands them down, as if she possessed but one mouth [With Christ]\"\n \n Eusibus of Caesarea \n \n \"But the brightness of the Catholic Church proceeded to increase in greatness, for it ever held to the same points in the same way and radiated forth to all the race of Greeks and barbarians the reverent, sincere and free nature, and sobriety and purity of the divine teaching as to conduct and thought.\n \n St Augustine\n \n \"The Catholic Church is the work of Divine Providence, achieved through the prophecies of the Prophets, through the Incarnation and the Teaching of Christ, Through the journeys of the Apostles, through the suffering, the crosses, the blood and death of the martyrs, through the admirable lives of the saints.... When, then, we see so much help on God's part, so much progress and so much fruit, shall we hesitate to bury ourseves in the bosom of that Church? For starting from the Apostolic chair down through sucessions of bishops, even unto the open confession of all mankind, it has possessed the crown of teaching authority\"\n \n Infallible Church\n \n Guided by Spirit into all truth\n \n 13 When the Spirit of truth comes, He will guide you into all the truth.

The Church Speaks with Christ's own Voice as the pillar and foundation of the truth\n \n 15 But if I should be delayed, I have written so that you will know how people ought to act in God's household, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth.\n \n Guided by Spirit into all truth by the Spirits teaching and reminding the Church of everything Jesus has told them. The Church Speaks with Christ's own Voice as the pillar and foundation of the truth. The Spirit sent by Christ Remains in the church\n \n 27 The anointing you received from Him remains in you, and you don't need anyone to teach you. Instead, His anointing teaches you about all things, and is true and is not a lie; just as it has taught you, remain in Him.\n \n Guided by Spirit into all truth by the Spirits teaching and reminding the Church of everything Jesus has told them.

Keep yourself pure.\n \n The Apostolic line appoints priests to every church and bishops to every diocese etc.\n \n 23 When they had appointed elders in every church and prayed with fasting, they committed them to the Lord in whom they had believed.\n \n Directed to appoint bishops and priests\n \n 5 The reason I left you in Crete was to set right what was left undone and, as I directed you, to appoint elders in every town:",

Let no man do anything connected with the Church without the bishop. Let that be deemed a proper Eucharist, which is [administered] either by the bishop, or by one to whom he has entrusted it. Wherever the bishop shall appear, there let the multitude [of the people] also be; even as, wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church. It is not lawful without the bishop either to baptize or to celebrate a love-feast; but whatsoever he shall approve of, that is also pleasing to God, so that everything that is done may be secure and valid\"\n \n St. Ignatius &#8220;The Epistle to the Smyrnaeans\" Chapter VIII.-Let Nothing Be Done Without the Bishop quoted at http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-01/anf01-21.htm#P2123_357530\n \n \n \nEarly Church Fathers: On Catholic Unity\n\n As noted above the Orthodox Church is 'catholic'. Therefore all your quotes in support of Catholic unity are equally valid to the Orthodox church. As is your evidence for Apostolic Succession, the delegation of power to the Apostles, etc.\n I note here you miss evidence that begins to undermine your own argument, because ALL the Apostles were equally so delegated, not just Peter. All the Apostles were given the foundation of the Church. Ephesians 2:19 Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and aliens, but fellow citizens with God's people and members of God's household, 20 built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone.",

   "Bradamante , as you know the catholic church...i.e those churches who the pope is the earthly head of and the Orthodox catholics, those who do not have the pope as the earthly head are the same Church, only in schism - the seat of peter has always existed, and certain doctrines have been devloped (not changed) by the seat of peter since the church back in 33AD, I agree.... \n \n You see christ said the holy spirit would LEAD us into the fullness of truth.....NOT that he would give us the fullness of truth at the first pentecost, but that he would lead the church into the fullness of truth, until Christs return.\n \n \n Then of course we have Christs promise to the church through the seat of peter...\"whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, whatever you loosen on earth shall be loosened in heaven\" \n \n so even if we have progressed and deveolped certain doctrines since the schism, we have the authority to do so.\n \n I do not deny that by simply remaining the same the orthodox churches have done what is right..... because the Orthodox catholics without the seat of peter do not have the authority to do so.",

   "Bradamante , as you know the catholic church...i.e those churches who the pope is the earthly head of and the Orthodox catholics, those who do not have the pope as the earthly head are the same Church, only in schism - the seat of peter has always existed, and certain doctrines have been devloped (not changed) by the seat of peter since the church back in 33AD, I agree.... \n\n \n You need to be clear about terminologies. When you say \"Orthodox catholics\" what do you mean?\n \n Do you mean this church...?\n \n http://www.orthodoxcatholicchurch.org/about.html\n \n \n\n \n You see christ said the holy spirit would LEAD us into the fullness of truth.....NOT that he would give us the fullness of truth at the first pentecost, but that he would lead the church into the fullness of truth, until Christs return.\n\n \n Where did Christ say that the Apostles wouldn't know all the teachings? See quote in post above.\n \n \nThen of course we have Christs promise to the church through the seat of peter...\"whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, whatever you loosen on earth shall be loosened in heaven\" so even if we have progressed and deveolped certain doctrines since the schism, we have the authority to do so.\n\n \n Where was Peter given sole authority? I've already shown scripture that says ALL the Apostles were the foundation of the Church. Matthew 18:18 shows that all the Apostles received the same powers\n \n St. Cyril of Alexandra said \"All the Apostles had the full teaching of truth. \" &#8230;for then Peter and John, who were of equal honour with each other, being both Apostles and holy disciples [would have been one, and], yet the two are not one.\"\n \n &#8220;Third Epistle of Cyril to Nestorius &#8220; at http://www.monachos.net/patristics/christology/cyril_to_nestorius_3.shtml\n \n \n \nI do not deny that by simply remaining the same the orthodox churches have done what is right..... because the Orthodox catholics without the seat of peter do not have the authority to do so.\n\n Thanks for you just-so statements. I had hoped you'd actually refute something I've said with, well 'facts'.",

I'm sure there are all sorts of movements out there that mix Christian thinking into something else: there were probably Zoroastrian movements with Christianity mixed in. There are 'voodoo/Catholic' movements that exist to this day. But since they don't follow the teachings of Christ in any orthodox way, the teachings that we have (which are all we have to go on), it doesn't make a lot of sense to think of them as Christian. (You seem to think we should base it on the supposed texts that have been lost, which is pretty much impossible!) At some point a religion ceases to be that religion when it changes from it's core beliefs, or (in the case of gnosticism) when an even earlier movement incorporates some of that religion's ideas.",

   "Questioning Q\n \n Ten Reasons to Question Q\n \n This is an overview of grounds for scepsis about Q. These ten points are intended to function not as self-contained, knock-down objections but rather, when taken together, to encourage some critical questioning of the Q hypothesis. \n \n 1. No-one has ever seen Q\n \n Current literature on Q abounds with editions of Q, investigations into its strata, studies of the communities that were behind it and analyses of their theology. In such circumstances, it is worth allowing ourselves the sober reminder that there is no manuscript of Q in existence. No-one has yet found even a fragment of Q.\n \n 2. No-one had ever heard of Q\n \n No ancient author appears to have been aware of the existence of Q. One will search in vain for a single reference to it in ancient literature. For a while it was thought that 'the logia' to which Papias referred might be Q. Indeed, this was one of the planks on which the Q hypothesis rested in the nineteenth century. But no reputable scholar now believes this. \n \n More reasons in the link below:\n \n http://www.ntgateway.com/Q/ten.htm\n \n Fallacies at the Heart of Q \n \n This is an introduction to some fallacies that cause Q to be more popular than it might otherwise have been. Five common viewpoints at the heart of the acceptance of Q will be stated and I will then attempt to explain why each of them is fallacious. This is an introduction to the relevant issues -- fuller exposition is available in \"A Monopoly on Marcan Priority? Fallacies at the Heart of Q\", Society of Biblical Literature Seminar Papers 2000 (Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature, 2000), pp. 538-622 (reproduced on this site -- click on the title). \n \n More in the following link: http://www.ntgateway.com/Q/fallacy.htm\n \n Frequently Asked Questions on \n the Case Against Q \n \n http://www.ntgateway.com/Q/faq.htm\n \n Key Quotations \n \n This is a gallery of quotations from famous Q skeptics. Included also is a poem by E. L. Mascall. \n \n &#61623; Austin Farrer \n &#61623; E. L. Mascall \n &#61623; James Hardy Ropes \n &#61623; Morton Scott Enslin \n &#61623; John Drury \n &#61623; E. P.

In the secon and third centuries there were, of course, Christians who believed in one God. But there were others who insisted that there were two. Some said there were thirty. Others claimed there were 365.\n \n In the second and third centuries there were Christians who believed that God had created the world. But others believed that this world had been created by a subordinate, ignorant divinity. (Why else would the world be filled with such misery and hardship?) Yet other Christians thought it was worse than that, that this world was a cosmic mistake created by a malevolent divinity as a place of imprisonment, to trap humans and subject them to pain and suffering.\n \n In the second and third centuries there were Christians who believe that the Jewish Scripture (the Christian \"Old Testament\") was inspired by the one true God. Others believed it was inspired by the God of the Jews, who was not the one true God. Others believed it was inspired by an evil deity. Otherss believed it wasn't inspired.\n \n In the second and third centuries there were Christians who believed that Jesus was both divine and human, God and man. There were other Christians who argued that he was completely divine and not human at all. (For them, divinity and humanity were incommesnurate entities: God can no more be a man than a man can be a rock). There were others who insisted that Jesus was a full flesh-and-bone human, Jesus, and a fully divine being, Christ, who had temporarily inhabited Jesus' body during his ministry and left him prior to his death, inspiring his teachings and miracles but avoiding the suffering it its aftermath.\n \n In the second and third centuries there were Christians who believed that Jesus' death brought about the salvation of the world. There were other Christians who thought that Jesus' death had nothing to do with the salvation of the world. There were yet other Christians who said that Jesus never died.\n (\"Lost Christianities: The Battles for Scripture and the Faiths We Never Knew\", Bart D.

Jesus said \"I am the Way\", so that there is a right way to believe in God. Else you must believe that Moslems are a type of Christian by virtue of the fact that they refer to Jesus as Christ.\n \n There is a right way...\n The Ethiopian gives a clue to being 'taught' the Word...

If the RCC and all other denominations disappeared and there were only small church groups christainaity would be just as correct and maybe fuller than it is now.\n\n Well again you disagree with the Bible and the evidence from the early church. All three roles are established in the Bible; deacons, priests, and bishops. Obviously you think that the Apostles were mistaken when they did these things.\n \n Deacons\n 1 Timothy 3:10\n And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless.\n 1 Timothy 3:13\n For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.\n \n Priests\n 1 Timothy 4:14\n Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.\n \n Presbytery\n \n 4244 presbuterion pres-boo-ter'-ee-on neuter of a presumed derivative of 4245; the order of elders, i.e. (specially), Israelite Sanhedrin or Christian \"presbytery\":--(estate of) elder(-s), presbytery.\n \n Strongs Lexicon\n \n http://www.eliyah.com/cgi-bin/strongs.cgi?file=greeklexicon&isindex=presbytery\n \n Bishops\n 1 Timothy 3:2\n A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;\n Titus 1:7\n For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;\n 1 Peter 2:25\n For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.\n \n In fact the office of Bishop is what makes us a catholic church (you probably believe the RCC interpretation that it means 'universal'). But, when first used by the Church it meant 'complete'.\n [Middle English catholik, universally accepted, from Old French catholique, from Latin catholicus, universal, from Greek katholikos, from katholou, in general : kat-, kata-, down, along, according to; see cata- + holou(from neuter genitive of holos, whole. See sol- in Indo-European Roots).]\n http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=catholic\n It thus means 'from the whole' or 'complete'. This is more easily recognised when we look to see where the term was first used...It first appears in The Epistle of Ignatius to the Smyrnaeans\n \"Chapter VIII.-Let Nothing Be Done Without the Bishop.\n \n \n \n See that ye all follow the bishop, even as Jesus Christ does the Father, and the presbytery as ye would the apostles; and reverence the deacons, as being the institution of God. Let no man do anything connected with the Church without the bishop. Let that be deemed a proper Eucharist, which is [administered] either by the bishop, or by one to whom he has entrusted it. Wherever the bishop shall appear, there let the multitude [of the people] also be; even as, wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church. It is not lawful without the bishop either to baptize or to celebrate a love-feast; but whatsoever he shall approve of, that is also pleasing to God, so that everything that is done may be secure and valid\"\n http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-01/anf01-21.htm#P2123_357530\n \n \n \n Thus the bishop is seen as making the church 'catholic'.

   "High Anglicans have a catholic belief system although they do not remain in full communion with the catholic church... they are very much catholic in their beliefs and catholic in baptism\n\n It depends on what you mean by 'catholic'. I have just given evidence that 'catholic' means 'complete' and it is used in relation to a church being presided over by a bishop.\n \n\n The creed was changed slightly after nicea from \"we believe in the holy spirit the giver of life who proceeds from the father\" to \"we believe in the holy spirit the giver of life who proceeds from the father and the son\"\n \n of course one could argue that this is not the offical teaching of the original church but of course one could also say God leads the church into the fullness of truth, if the church got the original 99% true would not God use all means in his power to guide it to 100% truth?\n\n No, the teaching changes the relationship of the Holy Spirit. We believe that the Holy Spirt originates in God the Father and goes THROUGH the Son, but the Holy Spirit does not proceed from the Son, as a first cause, which is what the filioque represents.\n \n This inclusion was resisted by all parts of the Church, including in the west, by the Pope.\n  Pope Leo III (795-816) intervened, and forbade any interpolations or alterations in the Nicene Creed. He ordered the Creed, without filioque, to be engraved in Latin and Greek on two silver plates on the wall of St. Peter&#8217;s in Rome.\n \n http://www.3saints.com/filioque.html \n \n \n St. Photius the Great argued against the Filioque in his classic piece the \"Mystagogy\". (see http://www.geocities.com/trvalentine/orthodox/mystagogy.html)\n \n \n The dogma of the double Procession of the Holy Ghost from Father and Son as one Principle is directly opposed to the error that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father, not from the Son \n http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06073a.htm \n \n In coming to understand the Procession of the Holy Ghost, from the Father and the Son, we can see this from the fact that the Son is \"begotten\" from the Father-- this is the first kind of procession-- the Son exists from eternity, but was \"generated\" as the Word (John 1:1). Now, the Holy Ghost is called the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of the Son (Gal., iv, 6), the Spirit of Jesus (Acts, xvi, 7). These terms imply a relation of the Spirit to the Son, which can only be a relation of *origin \n http://www.catholicapologetics.info/apologetics/protestantism/filioque.htm \n So, for Catholics (who changed the Nicene Creed) the Son has always existed, therefore the Holy Spirit always proceeds from Jesus\n \n Here are two important objections...\n Objection 4 &#8212; The Filioque confuses the Persons and confuses Person and Essence within the Holy Trinity\n \n \n \n This confusion is made clear by posing the following question:\n \n \n \n Does the power to proceed the Holy Spirit come from\n the Divine Essence common to all,\n or from a specific Person?\n \n \n \n To answer &#8216;from the Divine Essence&#8217; is to face two equally distasteful choices: either the Holy Spirit proceeds Himself or the Holy Spirit is not God. The first is patently ridiculous; the second is clearly outside Christianity. The answer to the above question is clear: the power to proceed the Holy Spirit belongs to a specific Person: the Father. This has been and remains the consistent teaching of the Church.\n \n \n \n But, the Filioquist objects, the Father has given everything to the Son, citing John 16:15 (All things that the Father has are Mine). Although admitting this does not really mean all since the Father does not give His &#8216;Father-ness&#8217; to the Son, they insist &#8212; with no justification other than their philosophical speculations &#8212; that it does include the power to proceed the Holy Spirit. By insisting this, the Filioquists demonstrate their confusion between the Divine Essence (what God is) and the Person of the Father (who the Father is). In begetting Seth, Adam gave Seth what he was, his &#8216;human-ness&#8217;, but he did not, he could not give Seth his &#8216;Adam-ness&#8217;: Adam and Seth are distinct hypostases, distinct persons. The Father and the Son are distinct hypostases, distinct Persons: the Father does not give His &#8216;Father-ness&#8217; (who He is), He gives his &#8216;God-ness&#8217; (what He is) to the Son. &#8216;All things that the Father has&#8217; refers to what God is and indeed it is true that all of what the Father is has been given to the Son &#8212; and is also given to the Holy Spirit (something consistently overlooked by Filioquists). The claim that the Father gives the Son the power to proceed the Holy Spirit is a claim that the Father gives who He is to the Son and thus confuses the Persons.\n \n \n \n But again the Filioquists object that the Father's &#8216;Father-ness&#8217; only refers to the Father's begetting of the Son and does not refer to the proceeding of the Holy Spirit. What? Did the Lord Jesus Christ reveal a name besides &#8216;Father&#8217; by which to know the first Person of the Holy Trinity? The answer is clear: &#8216;Father&#8217; is the only name of the first Person of the Holy Trinity. &#8216;Father&#8217; is as surely the name of the first Person of the Holy Trinity as &#8216;Adam&#8217; is the name of the first man. To make &#8216;Father&#8217; a mere description is to impersonalise the first Person of the Holy Trinity which, even if consistent with the direction of Augustine's teaching and the belief of the Filioquists, is repugnant to pious Christians. Moreover, the testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ contained in Holy Scripture is clear: the Father is the Cause of both the Son (by begetting) and the Holy Spirit (by processing). The Father is not merely the Father of the Son.\n \n \n \n The Filioquists offer an additional objection that the Son and the Holy Spirit are both Caused, and this thus &#8216;proves&#8217; there are attributes within the Holy Trinity that belong to only two Persons without belonging to the Divine Essence. Such a claim initially seems attractive &#8212; until one recognises the sloppy thinking behind it. The Son is begotten of the Father; the Holy Spirit proceeds of the Father. Begetting and proceeding are different. We may not know how they differ, but the teaching of the Lord Jesus Christ is clear: there is a difference. The pious Christian accepts the Lord Jesus Christ's teaching, recognising his inability as a creature to comprehend the Uncreated. He is of one mind with Saint John of Damascus:\n \n \n \n God then, is Infinite and Incomprehensible, and all that is comprehensible about Him is His Infinity and His Incomprehensibility.\n \n \n \n Objection 5 &#8212; The Filioque subordinates the Holy Spirit\n \n \n \n By teaching that there is something (the ability to proceed the Holy Spirit) shared by the Father and the Son but not shared by the Holy Spirit, the Filioquists clearly subordinate the Holy Spirit, making Him less than the Others.\n \n \n \n By teaching that the Holy Spirit is the result of &#8216;perfect love&#8217; between the Father and the Son, the Filioquists clearly subordinate the Holy Spirit, making Him completely contingent on both Father and Son and having no self-existence.\n \n \n \n By teaching that the Father is a Cause (of the Father and of the Son) and the Son is likewise a Cause (of the Holy Spirit), the Filioquists clearly subordinate the Holy Spirit by making Him the only Divine Person who is not a Cause of a Divine Person.\n \n http://www.geocities.com/trvalentine/orthodox/workinprog_filioque.html\n \n \n \n \nIf man has 100 sheep and looses one, does he not leave the 99 sheep in a open field and go out to find the one lost sheep?\n\n The fullness of teachings of Christ were given to the Apostles at Pentecost. There has never been any addition to dogma in the Orthodox church because we believe Jesus got it right in the first place. If you believe in the 'development' of dogma, that's up to you, but it is clear that the Nicence Creed you profess is DIFFERENT from the one that was drawn up in the 300s.",

   "There is one church, yes. However membership is not made up simply of those who believe in God. Even Jesus said this.\n Matthew 7:21\n Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.\n\n \n Yes, I know. Think of the possesed man that Jesus released by sending the demons into the pigs. In the passage the demons know that Jesus is God and he is all powerful, but they still aren't a part of the church. The key to becomeing a member is that you must choose to let God be your father, and master. \n \n \nYes, God is God of everyone, even those who don't believe in Him; God doesn't cease to be God. God is God.\n\n \n Just making the point that I am a child of the same God as you.\n \n \nSimply knowing He is God is not enough. Jesus said \"I am the Way\", so that there is a right way to believe in God. Else you must believe that Moslems are a type of Christian by virtue of the fact that they refer to Jesus as Christ..\n\n \n Sort of relating to what i said earlier in this post. You must become willingly subservient to God and love him with everything you got.\n \n \nThere is a right way...\n The Ethiopian gives a clue to being 'taught' the Word... (the Holy Spirit didn't just waltz down and inspire him)\n Acts 8:30 Then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. \"Do you understand what you are reading?\" Philip asked. \n 31 \"How can I,\" he said, \"unless someone explains it to me?\" So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. That is, Philip didn't just let him read it for himself to be inspired by the Holy Spirit.\n The Bible itself calls on us to keep to the 'traditions' as handed down, and in scripture\n Now I praise you, brethren, that you remember me in all things and keep the traditions as I delivered them to you (1 Corinthians 11:2)\n \n \"Therefore, brethren, stand fast and hold the traditions which you were taught, whether by word or by our epistle\" (2 Thessalonians 2:15).\n\n \n I agree, there is most definately a right way, and God can be verry detailed. I only disagree with following rules that are not scriptural and have no foundation in Christ. \n \n \nWe are to follow the teachers Jesus Himself chose. Why do you think out of all the hundreds that followed Him about He called 12 aside and taught them?\n\n \n Yes. This is correct, and i do follow, their teachings. \n \n \n \nWell again you disagree with the Bible and the evidence from the early church. All three roles are established in the Bible; deacons, priests, and bishops. Obviously you think that the Apostles were mistaken when they did these things.\n \n Deacons\n 1 Timothy 3:10\n And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless.\n 1 Timothy 3:13\n For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.\n \n Priests\n 1 Timothy 4:14\n Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.\n \n Presbytery\n \n 4244 presbuterion pres-boo-ter'-ee-on neuter of a presumed derivative of 4245; the order of elders, i.e. (specially), Israelite Sanhedrin or Christian \"presbytery\":--(estate of) elder(-s), presbytery.\n \n Strongs Lexicon\n \n http://www.eliyah.com/cgi-bin/strongs.cgi?file=greeklexicon&isindex=presbytery\n \n Bishops\n 1 Timothy 3:2\n A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;\n Titus 1:7\n For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;\n 1 Peter 2:25\n For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.\n \n In fact the office of Bishop is what makes us a catholic church (you probably believe the RCC interpretation that it means 'universal'). But, when first used by the Church it meant 'complete'.\n [Middle English catholik, universally accepted, from Old French catholique, from Latin catholicus, universal, from Greek katholikos, from katholou, in general : kat-, kata-, down, along, according to; see cata- + holou(from neuter genitive of holos, whole. See sol- in Indo-European Roots).]\n http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=catholic\n It thus means 'from the whole' or 'complete'. This is more easily recognised when we look to see where the term was first used...It first appears in The Epistle of Ignatius to the Smyrnaeans\n \"Chapter VIII.-Let Nothing Be Done Without the Bishop.\n \n \n \n See that ye all follow the bishop, even as Jesus Christ does the Father, and the presbytery as ye would the apostles; and reverence the deacons, as being the institution of God. Let no man do anything connected with the Church without the bishop. Let that be deemed a proper Eucharist, which is [administered] either by the bishop, or by one to whom he has entrusted it. Wherever the bishop shall appear, there let the multitude [of the people] also be; even as, wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church. It is not lawful without the bishop either to baptize or to celebrate a love-feast; but whatsoever he shall approve of, that is also pleasing to God, so that everything that is done may be secure and valid\"\n http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-01/anf01-21.htm#P2123_357530\n \n \n \n Thus the bishop is seen as making the church 'catholic'. Note it doesn't specify A PARTICULAR BISHOP (such as that in Rome).\n\n \n You misunderstand me. God did not create a political organization in any way. Organization is a nessicary, so as to keep the truth from getting... messed up (for lack of a better term.) i firmly believe in spiritual leaders/ commanders, but i do disagree with the idea that a chuch should be run like a buisiness, what so ever. Beurocracy is not really a good term. Sorry.",

   "High Anglicans have a catholic belief system although they do not remain in full communion with the catholic church... they are very much catholic in their beliefs and catholic in baptism\n \n The creed was changed slightly after nicea from \"we believe in the holy spirit the giver of life who proceeds from the father\" to \"we believe in the holy spirit the giver of life who proceeds from the father and the son\"\n \n of course one could argue that this is not the offical teaching of the original church but of course one could also say God leads the church into the fullness of truth, if the church got the original 99% true would not God use all means in his power to guide it to 100% truth?\n \n If man has 100 sheep and looses one, does he not leave the 99 sheep in a open field and go out to find the one lost sheep?\n \n God in his infinate wisdom has promised to us human beings that he will lead his church into the fullness of truth, he will use all means required in order to do that, we have his promise to peter.. the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven.... The church can not err  because Christ himself wont let it.\n\n \n Although our versoin of the niceen creed has this small change, we still believe in the trinity, and if you asked an anglican (who is a true son of God) I would imagine they would believe that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son. I would also have to dissagree on you comment about us not being in full communion. I am in full communion with God the Father, the Son and, the Holy Spirit. I confess that that Jesus is Lord, which means i am in communion with the Holy spirit, as scripture says \"No one can say Jesus is Lord but through the Holy Spirit.\" 1 corinthians 12:3. I commune with God always and everywhere, I pray constantly and seek wisdom in him, I am no less a child of God that any other believer, be they Roman catholic, or just Catholic, such as myself. \n \" I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing. If anyone does not abide in Me, he is cast out as a branch and is withered; and they gather them and throw them into the fire, and they are burned. If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you. By this is My Father glorified; that you bear much fruit; so you will be My disciples \" John 15:5-8. If i am not wiht the Father how can My life be so abundant. My full life could come from no other source than from the very God who created me. Please don't try to tell me I am not in full communion wiht my Father, because he says, by his actions towards me, otherwise. \n \n Also note that the church can err, the curch, had people burned in Jesus name for crimes they were'nt guilty of. The church at one time was corrupted with political power, and the chuch also had a great deal to do with, the crusades. I do agree on the other hand that there has always been a true church (the one to which I belong to before any denomination) that disagreed with Roman Catholic or other corrupted body so misguidedly called the church at that time. The reason Luther left the RCC was because it was Corrupted, they had announced that you could buy your or your reletaves way into heaven, or out of purgatory. This amoung other things was so rediculous that Luther created the the 95 thesis, and nailed it to the door. At the time the RCC was not the true church, it was corrupted and outof line with scripture \"by faith are we saved\". Luther represented the true church, it was not him that left the true church but the RCC and he was just returning.",

   "Concerning the filioque, it is not really that big of an issue anymore, even on the Orthodox side:\n \n \"Today many Eastern Orthodox bishops are putting aside old prejudices and again acknowledging that there need be no separation between the two communions on this issue. Eastern Orthodox Bishop Kallistos Ware (formerly Timothy Ware), who once adamantly opposed the filioque doctrine, states: \"The filioque controversy which has separated us for so many centuries is more than a mere technicality, but it is not insoluble. Qualifying the firm position taken when I wrote [my book] The Orthodox Church twenty years ago, I now believe, after further study, that the problem is more in the area of semantics and different emphases than in any basic doctrinal differences\" (Diakonia, quoted from Elias Zoghby's A Voice from the Byzantine East, 43). \"\n \n Also, many of the Church Fathers stated that the Holy Spirit proceeded from the Father and Son and the Greek Church agreed with this at first, then retracted.

   "We hold to the teachings of the first church, the church established by the appostals and paul. You need proof. Well i don't have any, except the fact that we personally know God. I do not see how any man can seperate us from our father by saying we have left the church. Yet we still commune with the father, and since he is the head of the church than we are still a part. If my brother (biological) told me that my dad didn't want to talk to me or be around me, I would go and ask my dad, If he told me he did wan't to talk with me and wanted to be around me i would discard what my brother said as incorrect. In this way i have felt Gods presence holding me close as i commune and pray and sing to him and if some one says we are not part of the Church i simply discard what they say. Regardless of your reply to this post i will continue to grow in Christ and my Father. But you are still my brother, so i would still gladely have communion with you. Godbless.\n\n I already noted Anglicans believe in the Nicene Creed as changed by Catholics. That's just one of many differences. I stay with that because no one's addressed even this one difference.",
