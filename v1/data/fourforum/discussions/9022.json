I have seen many speeches at various colleges and it seems there is a growing number of people interputing and being rude and then claiming they had a \"right\" to do so. Well, if we all have a right to speak whenever we want then I guess they support going into their classroom while they are taking a test and just \"protesting\" them the whole time. You can protest but this just being an a$$hole about it.",
