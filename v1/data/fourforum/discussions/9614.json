   "I am pro life. It used to be because that's what my parents believe, but I'm a grown up now and I make my own decisons on what to believe. I've researched it from both sides of the issue, and I can't find any reason to change my belief. \n \n The pictures of aborted babies is absolutely the worst thing one can see, but it's needed so we can be aware of what exactly this procedure does. This is NOT simply a mass of tissue! I can't believe that some of the brightest, most well educated people I know actually can call it that. (For those that believe these pictures are merely propaganda to scare people, then please explain to me from where else could graphic pictures like that come from except real aborted babies?!) The thing that breaks my heart even more is knowing that the babies are being mercilessly hurt in the process. People don't want to believe this, but it's true! Planned Parenthood actually states the following on their website: \"We know for sure that the embryo or fetus cannot perceive pain in the nearly 99 percent of all abortions that occur before the 20th week of pregnancy. It is even possible that a fetus is unable to perceive pain at any time during pregnancy.\"  \n \n Are you kidding me?!!! Where's your research to back that one up?! That sounds more like a wild guess to me! So what about the other 1 percent? Why is it that \"nearly 99 percent\" you are sure can't perceive pain? And then to actually say it is possible they can't perceive it any time during pregnancy?! Yes because you know, the nervous system doesn't actually develop until AFTER birth! emoticon_rolleyes Come on, let's get real here! Sorry, but that statement itself just sounds like a pathetic attempt to sound knowledgable when they really have no clue. The fact that they could actually post a statement like that on their website just shows how little these so called \"doctors\" really know or little they choose to believe about fetal development, so they can justify what they do every day. I just wish they weren't able to spew this non-sense to girls who come into their clinics feeling scared and desperate looking to someone to give them answers. \n \n Now yes, there are some women that go into it completely informed knowing exactly what they're getting themselves into and choose it anyway, and that's sad. But there are so many more that are being misinformed, told that it's no big deal and that's even sadder. Why is it that often the pro choice side pushes only one choice on women, abortion?! I think actually, the pro life side is more pro choice than the pro choice side is! Pro life wants to offer choices OTHER than abortion. Pro choice often seems to want to shove abortion in our faces making any other choice seem inferior. To make my point, I attempted to call the local Planned Parenthood, and the first option you hear is: \"to schedule an abortion, press 1\", now that's interesting! If it really is about choice, then why did none of the options state anything about counseling or adoption services? \n \n Sure it talks about adoption and being a parent on their website, but the way it's worded on there makes it sound like it's too difficult to endure whereas with the abortion option \"most women feel relief\" and they downplay any possible emotional stress involoved by saying \"Some people who oppose a woman's right to make her own reproductive decisions claim that abortion often causes long-lasting emotional problems, or \"post-abortion syndrome.\" There is no scientific proof for these claims.\" Hmm...that's interesting. Why don't we just ASK women who've had abotions...that's all the proof you need! I have been reading stories of women who in their own words talked about their abortion experiences....even the ones who claim to be pro choice and still are after the abortion make statements of lingering feeling guilt and regret over having it done as well as nightmares about it. If it's really no big deal, then why would they feel that way? One woman said her abortion was the most excruiatingly painful experience she's ever had. When she was crying in pain, the so called \"doctor\" ordered her to \"hush up! it isn't that bad!\" This was the same so called \"doctor\" who when she asked what the ultrasound looked like, he replied sarcastically with \"it looks like a tiny fetus\". So much for the compassionate care that these clinics supposedly offer.\n \n I've known women that have called Planned Parenthood and said that they felt like they were given no other option but abortion. Apparently that's just another form of birth control they like to offer. They even have a whole page on their site dedicated to trashing any counseling centers that provide other alternatives to abortion. So I guess basically unless you offer abortion as an option, then you can't possibly offer any good to women with crisis pregnancies. Yeah okay! \n \n Hmmm...ALTERNATIVES to abortion? Now that's what I call truly pro choice!",

(For those that believe these pictures are merely propaganda to scare people, then please explain to me from where else could graphic pictures like that come from except real aborted babies?!) \n\n \n Can you think of anyone who would allow their aborted foetus to be photographed? I can't, so I don't believe they are real. Just about all the photos you find online are of what looks like fully developed babies. They are all on biased pro-life sites, and are there to tug at your heart strings and not to educate you on what an aborted foetus actually looks like. None of them are of foetus' of 12 weeks or less gestation, and that is when the huge majority of abortions take place. I had an abortion at 8 weeks, and I did actually see what my foetus looked like, as I had to use a bedpan so the hospital can inspect what you are passing. It was the size of my fingernail, and looked like a small white blob basically. \n \n \nThe thing that breaks my heart even more is knowing that the babies are being mercilessly hurt in the process.

And then to actually say it is possible they can't perceive it any time during pregnancy?! Yes because you know, the nervous system doesn't actually develop until AFTER birth! \n\n \n No, but it does develop very late on, and most abortions are carried out early. Over 99% is pretty high, considering abortions carried out very late tend to be because of problems medically with the mother or the foetus where an abortion is the best option. \n \n \nThe fact that they could actually post a statement like that on their website just shows how little these so called \"doctors\" really know or little they choose to believe about fetal development, so they can justify what they do every day. I just wish they weren't able to spew this non-sense to girls who come into their clinics feeling scared and desperate looking to someone to give them answers. \n\n \n I wouldn't know much about PP clinics, I went to my hospital and had my abortion, where I was looked after by gynaecology nurses. \n \n \nNow yes, there are some women that go into it completely informed knowing exactly what they're getting themselves into and choose it anyway, and that's sad.

Pro choice often seems to want to shove abortion in our faces making any other choice seem inferior. \n\n \n That's really stupid. Those pro-life want to take away the choice of abortion, those pro-choice want to keep it. How are you offering other choices by taking away that option? I couldn't continue with my pregnancy because I've just taken on a mortgage, I have a daughter to take care of any I can't miss work and go on maternity leave pay because we can't afford it. I made the right decision for my family, and I'm happy with it. Nobody suggested a termination to me, I made my decision myself and booked an appointment, and then had another appointment with the unit who talked me through my options and made sure it was what I wanted. \n \n \nSure it talks about adoption and being a parent on their website, but the way it's worded on there makes it sound like it's too difficult to endure whereas with the abortion option \"most women feel relief\" and they downplay any possible emotional stress involoved by saying \"Some people who oppose a woman's right to make her own reproductive decisions claim that abortion often causes long-lasting emotional problems, or \"post-abortion syndrome.\" There is no scientific proof for these claims.\" Hmm...that's interesting. Why don't we just ASK women who've had abotions...that's all the proof you need! \n\n \n Ask me then. I'm happy with my choice.

I don't know about clinics but I was treated well by my hospital, and again, I don't regret my decision. From my hospital directory, it further states that being denied an abortion creates more adverse long term effects on a woman than abortion.",

Pro life wants to offer choices OTHER than abortion. Pro choice often seems to want to shove abortion in our faces making any other choice seem inferior.\n\n Absurd. Pro choice is exactly what it says it is. The choice to continue a pregnancy, or terminate a pregnancy. That's it. A person who truely identifies as pro choice feels that everyone should have the option of deciding to keep or abort a pregnancy. To push abortion on another would make one pro abortion, not pro choice.\n \n \n To make my point, I attempted to call the local Planned Parenthood, and the first option you hear is: \"to schedule an abortion, press 1\", now that's interesting!

Am I entitled to have an opinion and share it with others...sure. However, could others purchase a Brand X car and never regret it...absolutely. Should my negative experience be used to prevent others from engaging in something that they might consider positive?

Yeah okay! \n\n You always have the option...either have the baby or not...these options are never taken off the table. It is ultimately left up to the woman. Whether or not she seeks to educate herself about all the available options is up to her. What she chooses to do if she has the baby is another matter. There are many agencies aside from planned parenthood that will present you with information. Being an informed consumer when it comes to your healthcare is up to you. \n \n \nHmmm...ALTERNATIVES to abortion? Now that's what I call truly pro choice!\n\n Right!!! Now your getting it. There is another choice to abortion...to have the baby. That was a real mind-bender.",

The other one is the surgical one where the contents of the womb are emptied, and later on, they use the same one I had, which basically brings on labour in the later cases.

The use of \"car\" is really irrelevant. You can substitute \"buying a car\" with any activity that one might engage in where they could later view it as positive or negative. The point is, you are attempting to use someones negative emotional view to argue aganist something that can be a positive experience for others. I was attempting to point out that yes, while you are entitled to have an opinion and share that opinion with everyone, this does not give you the right to determine what is right for others. If you find abortion to be that objectionable, great...don't ever have one. But do not try to use 1 persons negative viewpoint of abortion to tell others what they may or may not do. I am willing to bet that for every person you find who regrets their abortion that you would be able to find one person who found their abortion to be the right choice for them. \n \n Oh, and in case you missed my request...could you please give the number of the Planned Parenthood clinic that you called so the rest of us could listen to it?",
