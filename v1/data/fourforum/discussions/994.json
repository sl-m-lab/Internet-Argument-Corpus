I wonder two things. I would want to look closer at the study design and two, I would like to hear a beaviorist point of view on it. What would skinner have said? I doubt that he would have attributed the results to a \"sense of fairness\" since that is not an observable item. He likely would have stated that any two animals receiving differential rewards would have likely learned that if they wait then they also will receive a more liked item. Not a sense of justice but learning by observation.\n \n Tolman further would argue that conditioned taste responses for the monkey receiving the preferred reward would be of greater value. In other words, if they were rewarded sometime when they didn't do anything would their work rate go down compared to the other monkey?\n \n Would the other monkey continue at the same rate although it may not accept the less preferred food?

   "\n Absolutely amazing. And capuchins, although bright relative to most other mammals, aren't as bright as chimps.\n\n \n I don't know about capuchins, and I am not going to a website. However, I have read just about everything Jane Goodall has written, and I do not see chimps as being \"just\". They willing hunt down old friends and kill them ( or help to kill them). In the Passion (name of a chimp - Jane named hers) case, the female monkey deliberately found other female members of her own tribe when they were alone and too far away for the others to hear cries of help, and with the help of her children ripped the babies from their mothers and proceded to eat them in front of the mothers. Then as if they had done nothing wrong they would go up and touch the mother \"lovingly\".Some people can say these show human traits (Jane does), however, while it is common for animals to kill and feel no remorse for it, many humans feel horrible remorse even if they were not directly responsible for killing another human. Some even feel remorse for killing animals. Whether you agree they are human traits or not, you must agree that most humans have some sense of justice. I do not see that sense of justice in all of Jane's research.",
