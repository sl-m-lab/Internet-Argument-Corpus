   "Many people on this forum have said that having the general populous vote on matters of civil rights is wrong. Apparently, members of the Massachusetts government agree. A bill has been proposed that will add civil rights removal to the list of constitutional amendments that can't be started via the initiative petition process, along side matters of religion or freedom of the press.\n \n Said state Sen. Jarrett Barrios (D-Cambridge), \"It is wrong to vote on somebody's civil rights just as it is wrong to vote on somebody's religion.\"\n \n This change, if passed, won't have any effect on the current battle over gay marriage there, but its backers hope that it will prevent other minorities from going through what gays are experiencing right now. \n \n Link:\n http://baywindows.com/ME2/Audiences/dirmod.asp?sid=008EC9FBCFF24AD18614290016BE1303&nm=Current+Issue&type=Publishing&mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&AudID=0813BC739F2044E5A03DCF2DE3FDF7C9&tier=4&id=49886EA62A3148F0B2EDC5B3FE1FBC2E",

   "What does this mean exactly? That issues could not be voted on there, and only candidates? If not, then I wonder what criteria will be in place for Bill 1772 and Sen, bill 26 to determine what sort of issues can and can't be voted on? Using an arbitrary phrase like \"civil rights\" just isn't specific enough--one can only surmise that there would be individual court cases coming up every time there's a petition about whether a given issue constitutes a \"civil right\" or not. The article needs more specifics as to how this would play out.\n \n I also find it interesting that the fact ballot initiatives can be \"bought\" or be carried out fraudulently is being used as a reason for opposition. General voting can also certainly be bought and be fraud-laden as well, yet I don't hear anyone saying we should get rid of general election voting because of these problems. Anytime there is a democratic process, there is always going to be the danger of someone misusing it. That's just the nature of democracy. It seems to me we should fight fraud and misuse, rather than getting rid of parts of the process because for that reason. If minorities' civil rights are truly being taken away and hurt due to ballot initiatives, then that is a far better reason to change the system than the fact there are people out there who misuse the system. And to change part of democratic process, there better be a damn good and demonstrable reason to do so.",

   "What does this mean exactly? That issues could not be voted on there, and only candidates? \n\n Ok, you knew the bill numbers, so you must have read the article. You must have missed where this was explained, I guess. We're talking about the initiative process for Constitutional Amendments, this has nothing to do with candidates. If enough people sign a petition the process to amend the constitution is started. This bill would exclude matters of civil rights from the subjects which would be valid targets of this process. Get it now?\n \n \n\n Using an arbitrary phrase like \"civil rights\" just isn't specific enough--one can only surmise that there would be individual court cases coming up every time there's a petition about whether a given issue constitutes a \"civil right\" or not.\n\n Just because you don't have a handle on what civil rights are doesn't make the phrase arbitrary. :) It's a legal term, not a catch phrase. I'm not a lawyer, I couldn't track down the exact definition they use in Massachusetts, but rest assured they have one.\n \n \nIf minorities' civil rights are truly being taken away and hurt due to ballot initiatives, then that is a far better reason to change the system than the fact there are people out there who misuse the system. \n\n And the risk to minority's civil rights is, of course, the reason for the bill. They are, after all, limiting what can be started via initiative, not eliminating the initiative process altogether. The fraud was merely an example of why the change is needed. As has been argued here before, if civil rights need protecting, it's from the majority. Allowing civil rights to be modified via the initiative process simply makes it too easy for the majority to impose it's will on the minority.

What I'm asking is, does this bill mean that ANY issue that could come up as an amendment would be illegal?

You're talking about limiting peoples' right to take part in democracy.\n \n \nSecond time you made that mistake. Due process involves criminal proceedings, not elections. Just so you know.\n\n \n Incorrect. Due process does not only apply to criminal proceedings. \n \n \"DUE PROCESS - The idea that laws and legal proceedings must be fair. The Constitution guarantees that the government cannot take away a person's basic rights to 'life, liberty or property, without due process of law.' Courts have issued numerous rulings about what this means in particular cases. \"(http://www.lectlaw.com/def/d080.htm)\n \n \"In United States law, adopted from British law, due process (more fully due process of law) is the principle that the government must normally respect all of a person's legal rights [Like the right to float a petition on an issue! emoticon_xgood ] instead of just some or most of those legal rights when the government deprives a person of life, liberty, or property.\" (from Wikipedia)\n \n Just so you know.\n \n \nLike fraud! Ta-da!\n\n \n No, you're not reading anything I've said to you. I've told you why fraud isn't a good reason to limit democracy. Evidence of fraud goes back throughout U.S. history and we don't limit the right to due process over it.\n \n \nAnd of course the fact that civil rights shouldn't be voted on in the first place.\n\n \n Circular reasoning. I've asked you now why it should be civil rights, and the imporance of doing so for this issue, and you're basically back to \"it's civil rights.\" Sort of like the proverbial \"It is because I said so.\" Is making statements without arguing them what you prefer? because that's what you're doing.",

At issue is whether the sex of the people getting married should prohibit them from marrying. The issue is not how gay people get married; the issue is to whom. \n \n To tell a gay person that they have the right to get married is to tell a gay person that they can marry someone they do not wish to marry. That's no right at all. The right to marry means nothing if we cannot marry the person of our choice who also chooses to marry us. \n \n The laws banning same-sex marriage are really a form of sex discrimintation. If you are male, you can marry a woman. Because I am a woman, I cannot marry a woman. Some argue this is because only a woman and a man together can reproduce. But I cannot reproduce no matter whom I marry, because of my age. Yet I can marry a man, even though I can no more reproduce with him than I can with with a woman. I have the right to marry a man, but I don't want to marry a man. So I have the right to marry, but only to someone I do not want as a spouse. I do not have the right to marry someone I do want as a spouse. That effectively means that I do not have the right to marry. \n \n The absurdity of the laws barring same-sex marriage become obvious in cases involving transgender people. I have two friends who are a lesbian couple, and they are legally married in my state of Ohio. How can that be? Because one of the spouses is transgender; she used to be male. Ohio does not recognize sex changes, and so in the eyes of the state of Ohio, she is still male and is therefore legally married to her woman spouse. Because she was born with male genitals, and her birth certificate says male, she can marry a woman. \n \n However, other states do recognize sex changes. If my friends were to move to New York, they might not be considered legally married; it's not clear. New York does recognize sex changes as legal, but not same-sex marriages. So in New York, my friends would be a same-sex married couple, which is legally impossible there. However, this might only be true if my friend legally changed her birth certificate. It's all very confusing. If states did not bar marriage between people of the same sex, this confusion would disappear, because it would not matter for the purpose of legal marriage whether my friend is legally a man or legally a woman.",

   "I understand where you are coming from on this. I was taking issue with something someone said. But there certainly is something different about the way gays want to get married--they want to get married in a same-sex marriage. That's what's different. You may argue that the difference is not important; nevertheless it is different. And I don't agree this is a form of discrimination over gender ('sex discrimination')--after all no one is saying you can't get married because you are male or female. If you were to get married the way society views marriage, it would not matter one iota if you are male or female. The real issue is that of getting married a different way than society views as ok. I realize of course that you are trying to change that and make something besides just opposite-sex marriage legal. And, let me say I also agree with E Mutz that your posts have good substance to them, and I too find them educational and informative.\n\n \n Opponents used the same logic during the inter-racial marriage debate. It wasn't racism, they said, because blacks could marry like whites. One can't marry a race based on one's race. That is race-based discrimination. One can't marry a sex because of one's sex.

The Constitution guarantees that the government cannot take away a person's basic rights to 'life, liberty or property, without due process of law.' Courts have issued numerous rulings about what this means in particular cases. \"(http://www.lectlaw.com/def/d080.htm)\n \n \"In United States law, adopted from British law, due process (more fully due process of law) is the principle that the government must normally respect all of a person's legal rights [Like the right to float a petition on an issue! emoticon_xgood ] instead of just some or most of those legal rights when the government deprives a person of life, liberty, or property.\" (from Wikipedia)\n \n Just so you know.\n .\n\n Do you realize that what you cited supports what I said and not what you said?

It's a bad argument. Fraud isn't the reason, it's the motivation. Preserving rights is the reason, the fact that people were willing to commit fraud to remove those rights justs shows how necessary it is to protect them. We don't generally write laws to avoid dangers that aren't happening. Since people are going to extreme steps to strip people of their rights it's clear that the danger is real. This isn't that tricky, where are you having problems following this?\n \n \n\n Circular reasoning. I've asked you now why it should be civil rights, and the imporance of doing so for this issue, and you're basically back to \"it's civil rights.\" Sort of like the proverbial \"It is because I said so.\" Is making statements without arguing them what you prefer? because that's what you're doing.\n\n Is making stuff up what you prefer? (rhetorical question, we both know the answer)\n You asked for a reason for the change. I supplied it. You did not ask why protecting civil rights constitutes a reason.

   "People already get married. The issue is (and has been) gay marriage. Marriage is already a civil right everyone has--you have it too, because you can marry someone of opposite-gender right now. The issue here is whether gay marriage is civil right. When someone says \"gays can't get married\" that's really not accurate. They CAN get married; they just want to get married a different way that society allows for.\n\n \n You keep repeating this without addressing the fact that gays cannot marry the person who is in their spouse of choice. So in the real world, gays cannot get married, because marriage does not mean anything if it's not to the person of our choice. Any legal marriage I would get into with a man would be fraudulent. It might be technically legal, but it would not be a real marriage. \n \n Gay people sometimes do get married to opposite-sex spouses, often because they are struggling with their sexual orientation and are trying, through marriage, to make themselves heterosexual. This often causes pain later on to the opposite-sex spouse, who is usually quite surprised to discover that his or her spouse is gay. Sometimes gay people get legally married because they have not yet come to the realization that they are gay. Especially in the past, gay people got married because they could not envision living as an openly gay person, and they married an opposite-sex person for cover, or because it was expected. Sometimes gay people get married for the health and other benefits. We had a married couple posting in the New York Times gay rights forum who were were married for this reason. They never had sex, and the woman was a lesbian. (I say she was a lesbian, because she passed away last year of COPD, sadly.) The man was heterosexual. Sometimes gay people get legally married to opposite-sex spouses in order to provide more support for their children. Sometimes gay people get married legally to allow for one person to immigrate to the United States. I knew a man some years ago who married a lesbian from a foreign country so she could move to the United States. She had a lesbian partner living here, but because they could not marry legally, she could not move here by marrying her actual spouse. So she arranged and paid for a fraudulent marriage to a man in the United States. \n \n These are mostly pretty bad reasons to get legally married to someone. But the truth is that we can ONLY marry for these bad reasons; we cannot marry for the purposes for which our society has an institution of marriage. We are not allowed to have REAL marriages.\n \n There are bisexuals who are legally married, and their marriages are certainly real. But they are allowed legally to marry only a spouse of one sex and not the other, and many bisexuals that I know, including married bisexuals, are among the most active workers for equal marriage rights for same-sex couples.",

   "Some folks argue that the laws barring same-sex marriage are not discriminatory because gay people can get married to people of the opposite sex. This sounds very much like the argument advanced by the Commonwealth of Virginia in the case of Loving v. Virginia in 1967. The Commonwealth of Virginia argued that the law banning inter-racial marriage was not discriminatory, because it did not prevent people of any race from marrying.....they just couldn't marry someone of a different race. They had to marry someone of the same race. The Commonwealth also argued that the law applied to everyone equally and was therefore not discriminatory. The Supreme Court rejected this argument and ruled that the law banning inter-racial marriage was unconstitutional. \n \n I am not predicting what the Supreme Court will do when and if a case challenging a state ban on same-sex marriage comes before the high court. But I am drawing a parallel between the arguments by the Commonwealth of Virginia and the arguments by those who claim that gay people already have equal rights, including the right to marry someone of the opposite-sex. Virginia argued, back in the 1960s, that both black people and white people already had the right to marry someone of the same race. Back then, the Supreme Court dismissed this argument.",

   "No, my traditional role is to call you on it when you lie. Snarky avoidance of the issues is clearly your territory.\n\n \n Kronos, I have never intentionally lied to you. With all due respect, you have a bad habit of reading a different take and/or point-of-view on a situation, and calling it a \"lie\". But i'm going to deal with this 'snarkiness' thing, so let's review your post, to nip this in the bud. These examples of \"snarkiness\" came at the end of several of your arguments in your last post alone ...\n \n - \"Is it set theory or basic logic that's failing you here?\"\n \n - \"you're just not getting this.\" (a very common pattern in your posts)\n \n - \"This isn't that tricky, where are you having problems following this?\"\n \n - \"Is making stuff up what you prefer? (rhetorical question, we both know the answer)\"\n \n Another very common thread I see in your posts is to portray disagreement or seeing a different angle as \"not getting it\" or \"having problems following it\". That's, of course, not the case--the fact is that not everyone sees these issues the same way you do. Do you understand what I'm saying here? I GET what your saying. I follow it just fine. I nearly always do--your posts aren't confusing; they are straightforward. Now, I note that many times, after you make your argument, you get in a dig at the end, like the ones I've just quoted, and then you have the hypocrisy a couple of posts ago to assert that I'm being snarky. Why not just debate without the snarky comments at the end of your points? I've learned a lot from your posts, and you have really good things to say sometimes. You've played a role in convincing me of a number of things. But there's no need to intentionally try to insult me. It really is ok to just simply discuss. I think we'd both enjoy these discussions more if you and I both stopped such tactics as what I've just quoted and simply discussed, in a friendly way.\n \n now, I'm sorry to other posters to have to waste forum space on this sort of thing, but I'm not going to let someone mis-characterize me or what I'm saying.\n \n On to your post (sans the above non-pertinent judgmental comments in my quotes)... \n \n \nMarriage is a civil right, and gays can get married, but you don't know if gay marriage is a civil right?\n\n \n No, marriage IS a civil right. The question is whether or not gay marriage is a civil right. In the same way that any other type of marriage other than between one man and one woman is a civil right. Marriage has to operate under an understanding of what it is. It has to have some sort of definition to it. It can't just be whatever anyone wants it to consist of, from a legal standpoint. Marriage, between one man and one women, is definitely a right. What we're determining, as a society, is whether other forms are a right as well--in this case the arrangement of one man and one man, or one woman and one woman, in marriage.\n \n \nWhat you said:\n \"but I don't see anyone calling for us to get rid of general election voting.\"\n The obvious parallel would be to getting rid of petitions. I don't know what you might have meant, but what you said shows that you thought someone was trying to get rid of petitions.\n\n \n I shouldn't have said \"get rid of voting\"; I should have said \"limit voting.\" That would have been the proper way to put it. My apologies. But IMO the point still stands; we don't limit voting because of fraud--election day still comes, ballots are still there, and even if voters are fraudulent, we still let their preferred candidate run for election. So I see no reason to limit petitions on the basis of fraud.\n \n \nThe \"excuse\" is preserving people's rights. The fraud shows the necessity. \n\n \n And I'm saying I don't think it shows the necessity. However you wish to describe it, the point is that fraud happens--it's not a reason/motivation/necessity enough to warrant limiting democracy, IMO.\n \n \nDo you realize that what you cited supports what I said and not what you said? Due process is about legal or criminal matters, not voting. If you were trying to exclude just some people from voting that might be a due process issue, but elections in general aren't.\n \n Fraud isn't the reason, it's the motivation.\n\n \n Fine, call it \"democratic process\" then. Taking issue with terminology doesn't change my central point about this being a case of limiting it. You're argument that preserving rights is the real reason only begs the question and takes us right back to the debate whether gay marriage (not just marriage) is a civil right.\n \n \nYou did not ask why protecting civil rights constitutes a reason. I wouldn't think explaining that would be needed, but if you don't find that sufficient reason just say so.\n\n \n Of course protecting civil rights would be a reason, but you're jumping the gun by automatically assuming gay marriage (or any form other than one man and one woman) is a civil right. Whether that's the case is the gist of the whole national debate, basically. Now some have argued that the Loving case declares marriage a civil right, and I would agree with respect to marriage as it was understood at the Loving case--which was one man with one woman. It seems a stretch to me that we can just take whatever form of union that comes along and assume Loving automatically applies.",

Additionally, the cost to the government in 2010 will be some $133 million, and in 2050 around $425 million.\n \n It is not known how much such partnerships would cost if legalized in America, because Great Britain has socialized healthcare and the United States doesn't. But it's a safe assumption that it would cost much more, being that the U.S. economy is around seven larger than the United Kingdom's.\n \n The debate over same-sex \"marriage\" in recent weeks has focused mostly on fairness and rights. But the cost to employers and the government -- both federal and state -- is another element to the debate that is sometimes overlooked.\n \n Conservatives opposed to same-sex \"marriage\" already have moral objections. The financial issue only compounds the problem.\n \n \"If I believed that it was an issue of basic fairness, I would say, 'Well, that's just fair,\" Glen Lavy, an attorney with the Alliance Defense Fund, told Baptist Press. \"But it's not an issue of basic fairness. Same-sex couples are not in the same situation as married couples.\"\n \n If marriage licenses are given to same-sex couples in Massachusetts next year, Christian business owners with moral objections to homosexuality will face a dilemma. Will they extend the spousal benefits, such as health insurance, to homosexual couples that are \"married\"? Or will they refuse to do so and face a lawsuit?\n \n Lavy said such a case would have strong religious freedom implications.\n \n \"That would be a violation of the religious freedom of employers who are morally opposed to [homosexuality],\" he said. \"[But] courts have not been overly sensitive to religious freedom claims.\"\n \n Estimating the cost of same-sex \"marriage\" to America is difficult, primarily because no one knows how many same-sex couples will seek a marriage license. A New York Times story in August reported that even though a court in Ontario, Canada, has legalized same-sex \"marriage,\" few homosexual couples want to take the step.\n \n But there are studies of the cost to businesses of so-called domestic partner benefits, which more than 200 of the Fortune 500 companies offer, according to the Human Rights Campaign. HRC, the nation's largest homosexual activist group, says that businesses' health insurance costs rise around 1-2 percent when they extend benefits to same-sex partners.\n \n So, how do they pay for the extra cost?\n \n \"That increased insurance cost would probably be passed along to the rest of the employees, because companies are getting strung out on what they can pay for healthcare,\" Lavy said.\n \n As an example, Lavy told the story of a phone conversation he had recently with an employee of a large company that has begun offering domestic partner benefits.\n \n \"[The company] has decided to give domestic partner benefits, and at the same time they're raising everyone's deductible,\" Lavy said. \"They're giving something to the same-sex couples but ... there are only so many dollars in the pot.\"\n \n If San Francisco is an example, then the government can have a major influence. In that city, 75 percent of the companies that offer domestic partner benefits began doing so after San Francisco began requiring it, according to a report on the city's website.\n \n Many social conservatives argue that benefits are provided to married couples because, in turn, married couples benefit society. Columnist Maggie Gallagher wrote in the Dec. 1 Weekly Standard that \"most of what can be described as the legal benefits of marriage, though now formally gender-neutral, were designed to protect women from the risks and costs that childbearing imposes.\"\n \n Because same-sex relationships do not benefit society, some say, they should not be afforded marriage benefits.\n \n \"Primarily, the benefits are offered [to married couples] because the relationship itself provides a rich benefit to the company, to the municipality, to the government,\" Focus on the Family's Glenn Stanton told Baptist Press. \"That is not true of any other grouping of people who come along and present themselves in the same sincerity.\"\n \n Stanton has written a book, \"Why Marriage Matters,\" on the societal benefits of marriage.\n \n \"Those companies are enhanced by the number of marriages that are present among their employees,\" he said. \"Marriage provides a real cash benefit to employers, because the married people are healthier, they're happier, they're more productive employees, they hop from job to job less, they are more reliable. There's less problem with dangerous behavior.\"\n \n There are \"literally thousands of studies\" to support his claims, Stanton said.\n \n \"There's really no debate about [the benefits of marriage] within the scientific community,\" he said.\n \n By contrast, same-sex relationships are generally short and physically unhealthy, Lavy said.\n \n Much of the legal debate this summer in the Lawrence v. Texas decision overturning anti-sodomy laws focused on homosexuals' behavior. In legal briefs the Center for Arizona Policy quoted data stating that homosexuals have an average of 50 lifetime sexual partners compared to only four lifetime partners for heterosexuals. Additionally, the brief said that 2 percent of homosexual couples are monogamous while 83 percent of heterosexual couples are. Data was compiled from \"The Social Organization of Sexuality\" and \"Sex in America: A Definitive Survey.\"\n \n \"There is no evidence out there that same-sex couples give these same kinds of benefits to corporations [as married couples do],\" Lavy said. \"There's no research that shows that.\"\n ",

   "\n Kronos, I have never intentionally lied to you.\n\n Honestly, I don't believe you. Possibly you don't recall your past behavior, but I do. I know you have frequently misquoted, mistated, manipulated, pretended people didn't say things, pretended you hadn't said things, and otherwise mangled the truth. Perhaps you're using some very specific definition of \"lie\" which you think you don't qualify for, maybe I've said \"lie\" when you were in fact engaged in some other form of dishonest debate. Whatever. You may well have improved recently, but years of putting up with your tactics has made me particularly sensitive to anything that looks like chicanery on your part. The fact that you refuse to acknowledge that you ever lied doesn't help.\n \n \n\n I GET what your saying. I follow it just fine. I nearly always do--your posts aren't confusing; they are straightforward.\n\n Then address what I'm saying. If your follow up to my posts doesn't actually address my post, if it doesn't acknowledge points I raise, if it acts like I never said what I said, then I have to assume you didn't get my point.\n \n \n\n No, marriage IS a civil right. The question is whether or not gay marriage is a civil right. \n\n Ah, now I see where you are confused. In Massachusetts, they don't have gay marriage. They only have marriage. They don't have gay marriage any more then they have black marriage or redhead marriage or left handed barber marriage. It's just the right of marriage, and people are trying to take it away from one small group which is legally entitled to it. The dichotomy which exists in your mind, gay marriage vs marriage, does not actually exist in reality. At least in Massachusetts.\n \n \n\n But IMO the point still stands; we don't limit voting because of fraud--election day still comes, ballots are still there, and even if voters are fraudulent, we still let their preferred candidate run for election. So I see no reason to limit petitions on the basis of fraud.\n\n So the \"address my point\" thing I mentioned? Here's an example. I clearly stated that fraud isn't the reason in my last post, and you're ignoring that. So what am I supposed to do here except ask what you don't get about what I said last time?\n \n \n\n And I'm saying I don't think it shows the necessity. However you wish to describe it, the point is that fraud happens--it's not a reason/motivation/necessity enough to warrant limiting democracy, IMO.\n\n The fact that \"fraud happens\" doesn't mean it isn't a reason either. The point here, once again, is preserving rights. If rights aren't under attack, we tend not to worry about them. We only take action when rights are threatened. In point of fact, rights are being threatened in Massachusetts. The method used to threaten those rights is the initiative process, that's why that process is being modified. Even if no law was being broken, civil rights are being threatened and so action is called for. The fact that people are willing to commit fraud to attack these rights is merely icing on the cake, it's just a sign that action is urgently called for.\n \n \n\n Of course protecting civil rights would be a reason, but you're jumping the gun by automatically assuming gay marriage (or any form other than one man and one woman) is a civil right.\n\n In point of fact, that issue is utterly irrelevant to this bill. It protects civil rights and doesn't address gay marriage at all. The attacks on gay marriage are part of the motivation, sure, \n but the issue at hand is only that of preserving civil rights. You say that's a valid reason, so do you have any actual issues with the proposed bill?",

I know you have frequently misquoted, mistated, manipulated, pretended people didn't say things, pretended you hadn't said things, and otherwise mangled the truth. \n \n \n Well I can't help it if you believe me or not; but you are more than welcome to back that up with something other than mere accusation; In fact I'd love you to, because I'm fully confident you're wrong. I mean, with your apparent standard of what's a lie, you lie here constantly! Just like you mis-stated Arch's point earlier. Perhaps this is all another example of you viewing a different viewpoint or take on a situation as a lie. We should probably take it to PM though; I don't think we need another thread of ours for the admin to have to delete. \n \n \nThen address what I'm saying. If your follow up to my posts doesn't actually address my post, if it doesn't acknowledge points I raise, if it acts like I never said what I said, then I have to assume you didn't get my point.\n\n \n Why should I when you don't address what I'm saying? You just try to take things in a different direction consistently. This is part of debate, Kronos--each person trying to control the debate. That's what you're doing by trying to shift things a different direction all the time.\n \n \nAh, now I see where you are confused. \n\n \n There it is again! You don't need to do that--just present your counter-argument. I'm not confused, nor have I been.\n \n \nIn Massachusetts, they don't have gay marriage. They only have marriage.\n \n \n The problem here though, is that your standard of what constitutes a civil right in the case of the petition issue is based on status quo, i.e. whatever is legal at the time. If it's not, then what else are you basing it on? Because it looks to me like you're argument here is that 'it's a civil right in Massachusetts because ... well, because you can do it there.' By your logic, if Massachusetts says it's legal to go shove your friend off a cliff, it's a civil right because you can do that in Massachusetts. That seems like a pretty poor standard to me. And even then, we need to remember that i's only one state. It defines marriage for Massachusetts; not for the rest of the country. Marriage is a state-by-state issue. You're correct that it's the state of the article in question, but there petitions take place all over the country, and I'm pretty sure you're for limiting them like this everywhere, not just in Massachusetts. \n \n See, the initiative to limit these petitions doesn't state in the case of gay marriage. It uses the broader arbitrary term (yes, I know, you think it's a legal one) of civil rights. What if the people feel a freedom-granting law is unjust or harmful? If they can't use petitions to help get it overturned, that limits their ability to fix things. Your thinking assumes Massachusetts can do no wrong in what it makes legal (and therefore a 'civil right'.)\n \n \nSo the \"address my point\" thing I mentioned? Here's an example. I clearly stated that fraud isn't the reason in my last post, and you're ignoring that. So what am I supposed to do here except ask what you don't get about what I said last time?\n\n \n No, I said, clearly as day, that your view of removal of rights is the reason (your substitution for fraud as a reason) is a case of begging the question. I did address your point; but your point doesn't go anywhere. So there's not much to address.\n \n \nThe fact that \"fraud happens\" doesn't mean it isn't a reason either.\n\n \n But you basically claimed yourself it wasn't the reason! (only something that shows 'necessity'.) Are you now changing your mind??\n \n \nThe point here, once again, is preserving rights. If rights aren't under attack, we tend not to worry about them. We only take action when rights are threatened. In point of fact, rights are being threatened in Massachusetts. \n\n \n I'll grant you that the right (of gay marriage) is given by Massachusetts, and so in the literal sense, then yes, limiting these petitions preserves 'right' in the sense that you are talking about. But IMO it's a very bad precedent to limit the peoples' ability to change 'rights' they feel are bad. It's one less way for the people to undo something done by the legislature, if need be.\n \n \nIt protects civil rights and doesn't address gay marriage at all. The attacks on gay marriage are part of the motivation, sure, but the issue at hand is only that of preserving civil rights. You say that's a valid reason, so do you have any actual issues with the proposed bill?\n\n \n Yes! As I said, given your standard of what constitutes a 'civil right' is simply that Massachusetts makes it legal (as in gay marriage) then the people have one less tool available to them to fix their laws if there's a problem and the law is allowing people too much freedom. Take for instance, gun laws. If a state makes fully-automatic assault weapons legal by registration, and the people feel that's going too far, why should they not have the ability to petition to get that changed? What if a state allows smoking in ALL public places (another civil right) and the people want that limited? You're taking away a tool they have to do that.",

   "The argument Ohio made was that it was gender-discrimination. It may be discrimination based on prejudice against gay people, but it's not prejudice on the basis of gender. Gender has nothing to do with it; I suspect anti-gay people don't care one bit if a gay person is male or female, in terms of whether they would allow gay marriage. It's the type of marriage (gay marriage) that causes the ire, not the gender of it's participants. i.e. No one is saying you can't marry because you're male, for instance.\n\n \n My argument is not that the discrimination is based on prejudice against men or women, but that the discrimination takes the form of sex discrimination, in this case a prohibition against a woman marrying another woman or a man marrying another man. It is the sex of the participants that causes the ire, just as it was the race of the participants that caused the ire in inter-racial marriages. The ire was caused then by the idea that a white person could dare to marry a black person, which a majority of people for most of American history viewed as unnatural, against the Bible, and a threat to public order and common decency. The ire now is caused by the idea that a man could dare to marry a man or a woman could dare to marry a woman. Does this opposition result from prejudice against gay people? Yes, certainly that is the root, as you suggest. But the form that the discrimination takes is sex discrimination. I cannot marry a woman because I am a woman. A man can marry a woman. A man cannot marry a man because he is a man. A woman can marry a man.",

   "\n The problem here though, is that your standard of what constitutes a civil right in the case of the petition issue is based on status quo, i.e. whatever is legal at the time. \n\n \"civil rights\" has two distinct, yet related, meanings. One deals with what you might call \"innate rights\", and is based on the concept that people should be treated equally. The other is simply any right guaranteed by the government. For example, the Constitution says we have freedom of speech, therefore freedom of speech is a civil right. So yes, you are quite right. If Massachusetts says that gays have the legal right to marry, then it is in fact a civil right, by definition. I would also say that it's a civil right by the first definition, but that's a more contentious point. Since it clearly fits the second definition there's no need to go there, however. We can save that debate for another thread.\n \n \n\n And even then, we need to remember that i's only one state. It defines marriage for Massachusetts; not for the rest of the country. Marriage is a state-by-state issue. You're correct that it's the state of the article in question, but there petitions take place all over the country, and I'm pretty sure you're for limiting them like this everywhere, not just in Massachusetts. \n\n Not sure I see your point here.

If they can't use petitions to help get it overturned, that limits their ability to fix things. Your thinking assumes Massachusetts can do no wrong in what it makes legal (and therefore a 'civil right'.)\n\n I'm concerned with real problems, not hypothetical ones. People are, as we speak, trying to steal rights from people in Massachusetts. I'm not even sure how giving or protecting civil rights could be harmful, but if it happens we can deal with it then. But if we must err on one side on the other, I'll always err on the side of protecting rights, not making them easier to take away. I know that stealing rights can be bad, I really can't imagine how protecting them can be particularly harmful.\n \n \n\n No, I said, clearly as day, that your view of removal of rights is the reason (your substitution for fraud as a reason) is a case of begging the question. I did address your point; but your point doesn't go anywhere. So there's not much to address.\n\n I really don't think you did. Humor me and show me where?\n \n \n\n But you basically claimed yourself it wasn't the reason! (only something that shows 'necessity'.) Are you now changing your mind??\n\n No, I'm pointing out the flaw in your reasoning. Simply pointing out that fraud exists does not address if it's a valid reason here one way or the other.\n \n \n\n I'll grant you that the right (of gay marriage) is given by Massachusetts, and so in the literal sense, then yes, limiting these petitions preserves 'right' in the sense that you are talking about. But IMO it's a very bad precedent to limit the peoples' ability to change 'rights' they feel are bad. It's one less way for the people to undo something done by the legislature, if need be.\n\n History gives us a mountain of examples where removal of rights was bad. Can you think of any where it was good? And as I've said before, if rights need protecting it's from the majority; that's why you don't give them a tool to make the suppression of rights easier. That's the core reason why civil rights, by either definition, should not be subject to the will of the majority. Certain fundamental protections should not be prey to the whim of the moment.\n \n \n\n Yes! As I said, given your standard of what constitutes a 'civil right' is simply that Massachusetts makes it legal (as in gay marriage) then the people have one less tool available to them to fix their laws if there's a problem and the law is allowing people too much freedom.

You're taking away a tool they have to do that.\n\n Were not talking about laws here, we're talking about amending the state constitution. If people want to overturn a law they are free to petition to do so. They just can't enshrine the removal of civil rights in the constitution. So in your example they could petition to overturn the assault weapon law, but they couldn't petition to remove the right to bear arms from the constitution.",

   "Same-sex 'marriage' likely to prove costly\n \n By Tom Ramstack\n THE WASHINGTON TIMES\n Published May 18, 2004\n \n Employers, insurance companies, consumers and the government would foot the bill for the financial benefits that homosexuals would gain if same-sex \"marriage\" is legalized nationally. \n Insurance and tax costs would drop for the partners, while spousal benefits would increase. \n A General Accounting Office report lists 1,138 federal laws in which marital status conveys benefits, rights or privileges. The benefits include Social Security, disability payments, food stamps, Medicare and welfare. \n \"Won't this just break the bank?\" said Rep. Spencer Bachus, Alabama Republican, during a House Judiciary Constitution subcommittee hearing last week on same-sex \"marriage.\" \n Health care and retirement benefits for domestic partners of federal employees would cost the government about $1.4 billion from 2004 to 2013, according to a Congressional Budget Office report that was cited by Mr. Bachus. \n Like President Bush, he supports a proposed constitutional amendment that would define marriage as a union between a man and a woman. \n The exact cost to the government if same-sex \"marriage\" benefits were extended nationally has not been tallied, although government officials say it would be high. \n \"It would undoubtedly have a significant impact on the budget through lower revenues and higher spending,\" White House spokesman Trent Duffy said. \n Massachusetts yesterday began allowing same-sex \"marriages,\" and other states are considering it. \n However, only the federal government can decide who can file joint tax returns, receive Social Security or get other federal benefits. \n \"For tax purposes, it doesn't matter what the states rule,\" said Tara Bradshaw, spokeswoman for the Treasury Department. \n Many unmarried homosexual couples pay significantly more in federal and state taxes than their married counterparts, according to a National Gay and Lesbian Task Force report released last month. \n The report profiled a homosexual couple that paid $1,929, or 25 percent, more per year in state and federal taxes than a heterosexual couple earning the same amount. The homosexual couple could not file a joint tax return. \n As with opposite-sex couples, the sliding scale of tax rates would create the biggest advantage of a joint return for same-sex \"married\" couples with greatly different incomes. Equal incomes would create no advantage for a joint return. \n Greater financial advantages also would come from insurance and Social Security benefits, which married people can receive when their spouses are sick, injured or die. \n Insurance companies interpret their obligations to same-sex domestic partners differently. \n In California, Kaiser Permanente, a health care provider, said it would provide same-sex partner benefits until the state Supreme Court rules otherwise. \n However, State Farm Insurance, the auto and home insurance company, said it would provide same-sex partner benefits in California, only if the state Supreme Court gives legal recognition to homosexual \"marriages\" this summer. \n Nevertheless, many employers are granting domestic-partner benefits, such as health insurance, as an incentive. \n \"By itself, that's a big advantage, because an individual can rarely find the same kind of health insurance deal offered by a big company,\" said Jackie Perlman, senior tax research analyst for H&R Block. \n Currently, employees who receive the benefits for domestic partners pay taxes on them. Legalized \"marriage\" for same-sex couples would eliminate the tax. \n Any higher costs for employers would be passed on to consumers as higher prices for products and services. \n The costs for employers would include more expensive insurance as insurers raise rates to cover the new beneficiaries and protect their bottom lines. \n \"If the law required that such benefits be paid, then rates would be adjusted accordingly and insurers would suffer no net loss,\" said Bob Hartwig, chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute, a trade organization of the insurance industry. \n A limit on costs is naturally imposed by the number of homosexual couples. The Census Bureau estimates 594,000 homosexual couples live together, compared with 57.9 million heterosexual married couples living together. \n In the past year, 36 more of the nation's 500 largest companies have offered domestic-partner benefits to same-sex couples, raising the total to 311, according to the Human Rights Campaign, a homosexual advocacy group based in Washington. \n They include Apple Computer, General Electric, UPS, Nike, Best Buy and Anheuser-Busch. \n The Institute of Management and Administration (IOMA), a human resources trade organization, says the costs are relatively small for employers. Same-sex partner benefits raise costs for employers by less than 2 percent, according to IOMA. \n Other federal taxes and benefits reserved for heterosexual married couples involve estates and gifts. \n Married couples can give each other gifts and their estates without paying taxes. Same-sex couples get no special tax break. \n \"For marriage purposes, an estate is treated as a community,\" said Chris Sega, an estates and trusts lawyer with Washington law firm Venable. \"In the absence of a marriage, when it passes from one to the other, it would be taxed. In a marriage, it would be taxed only when it's left the community.\" \n The Virginia Bureau of Insurance forbids state-based companies from offering domestic-partner health-insurance benefits to same-sex couples. Self-insured companies are exempted. \n In Maryland, Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr., a Republican, opposes same sex \"marriages,\" said spokeswoman Shareese DeLeaver. \n The issue has arisen in the Maryland General Assembly, but any legislation has been killed in committee, she said. \n Support for same-sex \"marriage\" in the District is weak. \n D.C. Mayor Anthony A.

   "Same-sex 'marriage' likely to prove costly\n \n By Tom Ramstack\n THE WASHINGTON TIMES\n Published May 18, 2004\n \n Employers, insurance companies, consumers and the government would foot the bill for the financial benefits that homosexuals would gain if same-sex \"marriage\" is legalized nationally. \n Insurance and tax costs would drop for the partners, while spousal benefits would increase. \n A General Accounting Office report lists 1,138 federal laws in which marital status conveys benefits, rights or privileges. The benefits include Social Security, disability payments, food stamps, Medicare and welfare. \n \"Won't this just break the bank?\" said Rep. Spencer Bachus, Alabama Republican, during a House Judiciary Constitution subcommittee hearing last week on same-sex \"marriage.\" \n Health care and retirement benefits for domestic partners of federal employees would cost the government about $1.4 billion from 2004 to 2013, according to a Congressional Budget Office report that was cited by Mr. Bachus. \n Like President Bush, he supports a proposed constitutional amendment that would define marriage as a union between a man and a woman. \n The exact cost to the government if same-sex \"marriage\" benefits were extended nationally has not been tallied, although government officials say it would be high. \n \"It would undoubtedly have a significant impact on the budget through lower revenues and higher spending,\" White House spokesman Trent Duffy said. \n Massachusetts yesterday began allowing same-sex \"marriages,\" and other states are considering it. \n However, only the federal government can decide who can file joint tax returns, receive Social Security or get other federal benefits. \n \"For tax purposes, it doesn't matter what the states rule,\" said Tara Bradshaw, spokeswoman for the Treasury Department. \n Many unmarried homosexual couples pay significantly more in federal and state taxes than their married counterparts, according to a National Gay and Lesbian Task Force report released last month. \n The report profiled a homosexual couple that paid $1,929, or 25 percent, more per year in state and federal taxes than a heterosexual couple earning the same amount. The homosexual couple could not file a joint tax return. \n As with opposite-sex couples, the sliding scale of tax rates would create the biggest advantage of a joint return for same-sex \"married\" couples with greatly different incomes. Equal incomes would create no advantage for a joint return. \n Greater financial advantages also would come from insurance and Social Security benefits, which married people can receive when their spouses are sick, injured or die. \n Insurance companies interpret their obligations to same-sex domestic partners differently. \n In California, Kaiser Permanente, a health care provider, said it would provide same-sex partner benefits until the state Supreme Court rules otherwise. \n However, State Farm Insurance, the auto and home insurance company, said it would provide same-sex partner benefits in California, only if the state Supreme Court gives legal recognition to homosexual \"marriages\" this summer. \n Nevertheless, many employers are granting domestic-partner benefits, such as health insurance, as an incentive. \n \"By itself, that's a big advantage, because an individual can rarely find the same kind of health insurance deal offered by a big company,\" said Jackie Perlman, senior tax research analyst for H&R Block. \n Currently, employees who receive the benefits for domestic partners pay taxes on them. Legalized \"marriage\" for same-sex couples would eliminate the tax. \n Any higher costs for employers would be passed on to consumers as higher prices for products and services. \n The costs for employers would include more expensive insurance as insurers raise rates to cover the new beneficiaries and protect their bottom lines. \n \"If the law required that such benefits be paid, then rates would be adjusted accordingly and insurers would suffer no net loss,\" said Bob Hartwig, chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute, a trade organization of the insurance industry. \n A limit on costs is naturally imposed by the number of homosexual couples. The Census Bureau estimates 594,000 homosexual couples live together, compared with 57.9 million heterosexual married couples living together. \n In the past year, 36 more of the nation's 500 largest companies have offered domestic-partner benefits to same-sex couples, raising the total to 311, according to the Human Rights Campaign, a homosexual advocacy group based in Washington. \n They include Apple Computer, General Electric, UPS, Nike, Best Buy and Anheuser-Busch. \n The Institute of Management and Administration (IOMA), a human resources trade organization, says the costs are relatively small for employers. Same-sex partner benefits raise costs for employers by less than 2 percent, according to IOMA. \n Other federal taxes and benefits reserved for heterosexual married couples involve estates and gifts. \n Married couples can give each other gifts and their estates without paying taxes. Same-sex couples get no special tax break. \n \"For marriage purposes, an estate is treated as a community,\" said Chris Sega, an estates and trusts lawyer with Washington law firm Venable. \"In the absence of a marriage, when it passes from one to the other, it would be taxed. In a marriage, it would be taxed only when it's left the community.\" \n The Virginia Bureau of Insurance forbids state-based companies from offering domestic-partner health-insurance benefits to same-sex couples. Self-insured companies are exempted. \n In Maryland, Gov. Robert L.

If those efforts were to be successful, then supposedly all of us gay people would marry opposite-sex spouses, and the cost to the government would end up being the same as if we married same-sex spouses. \n \n Btw, my employer offers partner benefits to same-sex domestic partners, though the partners, like married spouses, actually have to pay for their premiums. That's because my employer will include domestic partners in family coverage, but the employer does not pay the premiums for the family coverage....my employer pays only the employee's portion of the family coverage. We employees (of all sexual orientations) have to pay the premiums for our children and spouses. This is becoming more and more common in the U.S., as employers strip down costly health insurance benefits. The benefit to our families amounts to spouses and domestic partners and children being included in the insurance coverage if we want them to be and if we pay the premiums for our family members. Our insurance provider is Kaiser Permanente. \n \n It benefits the employees as a whole financially to include domestic partner coverage, because this expands the pool of insured employees, thus spreading the cost of health care among a greater number of people. The result is that including our domestic partners in our insurance pool tends to hold down the costs of the premiums to everyone in our group. With a very small pool of covered people in a group, a single catastrophic illness can push future premiums sky high, when the current contract expires with the insurance provider and the employer and the provider negotiate for a new contract. For example, our provider, Kaiser, has usually held premiums down over time, but this year they want us as a college to pay a 20% increase, because we had several catastrophic and expensive claims recently. \n \n So, to sum up that rather long explanation, including domestic partners in our coverage helps to hold our employer's and employees' health care costs down by expanding the size of our insured pool.",

   "Well I can't help it if you believe me or not; but you are more than welcome to back that up with something other than mere accusation; In fact I'd love you to, because I'm fully confident you're wrong. I mean, with your apparent standard of what's a lie, you lie here constantly! Just like you mis-stated Arch's point earlier. Perhaps this is all another example of you viewing a different viewpoint or take on a situation as a lie. We should probably take it to PM though; I don't think we need another thread of ours for the admin to have to delete. \n \n \n \n Why should I when you don't address what I'm saying? You just try to take things in a different direction consistently. This is part of debate, Kronos--each person trying to control the debate. That's what you're doing by trying to shift things a different direction all the time.\n \n \n \n There it is again! You don't need to do that--just present your counter-argument. I'm not confused, nor have I been.\n \n \n \n The problem here though, is that your standard of what constitutes a civil right in the case of the petition issue is based on status quo, i.e. whatever is legal at the time. If it's not, then what else are you basing it on? Because it looks to me like you're argument here is that 'it's a civil right in Massachusetts because ... well, because you can do it there.' By your logic, if Massachusetts says it's legal to go shove your friend off a cliff, it's a civil right because you can do that in Massachusetts. That seems like a pretty poor standard to me. And even then, we need to remember that i's only one state. It defines marriage for Massachusetts; not for the rest of the country. Marriage is a state-by-state issue. You're correct that it's the state of the article in question, but there petitions take place all over the country, and I'm pretty sure you're for limiting them like this everywhere, not just in Massachusetts. \n \n See, the initiative to limit these petitions doesn't state in the case of gay marriage. It uses the broader arbitrary term (yes, I know, you think it's a legal one) of civil rights. What if the people feel a freedom-granting law is unjust or harmful? If they can't use petitions to help get it overturned, that limits their ability to fix things. Your thinking assumes Massachusetts can do no wrong in what it makes legal (and therefore a 'civil right'.)\n \n \n \n No, I said, clearly as day, that your view of removal of rights is the reason (your substitution for fraud as a reason) is a case of begging the question. I did address your point; but your point doesn't go anywhere. So there's not much to address.\n \n \n \n But you basically claimed yourself it wasn't the reason! (only something that shows 'necessity'.) Are you now changing your mind??\n \n \n \n I'll grant you that the right (of gay marriage) is given by Massachusetts, and so in the literal sense, then yes, limiting these petitions preserves 'right' in the sense that you are talking about. But IMO it's a very bad precedent to limit the peoples' ability to change 'rights' they feel are bad. It's one less way for the people to undo something done by the legislature, if need be.\n \n \n \n Yes! As I said, given your standard of what constitutes a 'civil right' is simply that Massachusetts makes it legal (as in gay marriage) then the people have one less tool available to them to fix their laws if there's a problem and the law is allowing people too much freedom. Take for instance, gun laws. If a state makes fully-automatic assault weapons legal by registration, and the people feel that's going too far, why should they not have the ability to petition to get that changed? What if a state allows smoking in ALL public places (another civil right) and the people want that limited? You're taking away a tool they have to do that.\n\n \n \n \n So if I understand you correctly you do not believe that marriage is a civil right? If this is the case then you should have no problem if I choose some hetero at random even yourself and sue to have marriage licenses taken away. On the griunds that I do not believe in heterosexual marriage, I believe it is a sin, it is nasty, it will only result in divorce anway, and is against my religious beliefs. The point is that most heterosexuals believe that they have the right to get married. They believe that marriage is a civil right.",

   "\"civil rights\" has two distinct, yet related, meanings. One deals with what you might call \"innate rights\", and is based on the concept that people should be treated equally. The other is simply any right guaranteed by the government. For example, the Constitution says we have freedom of speech, therefore freedom of speech is a civil right. So yes, you are quite right. If Massachusetts says that gays have the legal right to marry, then it is in fact a civil right, by definition. I would also say that it's a civil right by the first definition, but that's a more contentious point. Since it clearly fits the second definition there's no need to go there, however. We can save that debate for another thread.\n\n \n Ah, now we're getting to the real heart of this. So then on what basis do civil rights groups, in your thinking, fight for things that aren't in place, by law? Such as gay marriage, in places where it's NOT a civil right by law? Is that the \"innate rights\" thing? This would be the case everywhere else but Massachusetts. It seems to me that when it's all said and done, what constitutes civil rights (by your 1st standard) often comes down to some groups' opinions.\n \n Note too that the way the govt. has often dealt with the civil rights problem is to create a law, such as the Civil Rights Act and a number of amendments down through history. If it had been the status quo by law, this would have been unnecessary. Again, perhaps this falls under what you call the \"concept\" of innate rights, and so you're getting into realm of opinion. The only thing that can ever be truly concrete on this is law, so your second definition is the only one that has any teeth. And are you for certain that this petition initiative is limited to your second definition of civil rights (which is the only one that's concrete) and not able to be used against something arbitrary (your first definition)? That's my concern.\n \n \nNot sure I see your point here. Everything you said there is right, but I don't see where you're going with it.\n\n \n I was just pointing out that your view does little in the broader, national-level arena of gay rights. It applies only to one state.\n \n \nI'm concerned with real problems, not hypothetical ones. People are, as we speak, trying to steal rights from people in Massachusetts. I'm not even sure how giving or protecting civil rights could be harmful, but if it happens we can deal with it then. But if we must err on one side on the other, I'll always err on the side of protecting rights, not making them easier to take away. I know that stealing rights can be bad, I really can't imagine how protecting them can be particularly harmful.\n\n \n By that standard we would never have laws against anything, and we'd be living in a state of anarchy. Everything we do has to be clearly defined and have limits. Even everyday things we do has limits--you can walk anywhere in a public place, but you can't walk in the middle of the freeway. It's part of the process. The limits to marriage, right now in most of the country is one man and one woman. In Massachusetts that limit is extended somewhat, to include one other arrangement--same-sex couples, still limited to 2 per arrangement. Marriage STILL has limits, even there.\n \n \nI really don't think you did. Humor me and show me where?\n\n \"Of course protecting civil rights would be a reason, but you're jumping the gun by automatically assuming gay marriage (or any form other than one man and one woman) is a civil right. Whether that's the case is the gist of the whole national debate, basically. Now some have argued that the Loving case declares marriage a civil right, and I would agree with respect to marriage as it was understood at the Loving case--which was one man with one woman. It seems a stretch to me that we can just take whatever form of union that comes along and assume Loving automatically applies.\"\n \n \nNo, I'm pointing out the flaw in your reasoning. Simply pointing out that fraud exists does not address if it's a valid reason here one way or the other.\n\n \n But it's the article that is pointing out that fraud exists (not me) and using it for a reason/motivation/problem. If it's a flaw, you should be taking it up with the article. I'm just addressing the situation on the grounds that it laid out.\n \n \nHistory gives us a mountain of examples where removal of rights was bad. Can you think of any where it was good? \n\n \n Goodness! Yes, there are mountains of such examples. Every time we put someone in prison, there such an example. The removal and subjugation of the Nazi regime. There is a reason we don't have anarchy in this country, and the reason is that we have limits on what people can do. Your solution here is to take yet one other tool the people have to limit things going too far , away from them. \n \n \nWere not talking about laws here, we're talking about amending the state constitution. If people want to overturn a law they are free to petition to do so. They just can't enshrine the removal of civil rights in the constitution. So in your example they could petition to overturn the assault weapon law, but they couldn't petition to remove the right to bear arms from the constitution.\n\n \n I don't think you understand. If there's a case where it's LEGAL (your standard for civil rights) to have assault weapons (and there are such cases), then that's a civil right. Your view essentially prevents that from being taken away by petition if the people feel it is necessary. This is just an example. There are lots of cases where this could come back to bite those who are for it.",

Every time we put someone in prison, there such an example. The removal and subjugation of the Nazi regime.\n\n Nazis? Bad example, they didn't have civil rights here. But jail is a good one. We do need to take some civil rights from those who have shown, via their actions, that they are a danger to others. So let me rephrase a bit. We've seen rights taken away with bad results, can you show me where rights were prevented from being taken away with bad results? That's really your argument here, right? You want to make it easy for the people to strips rights from others, you seem to think this is a necessary tool. We know that giving the people this tool can be harmful, look at the history of the south. Can you show anything to balance that danger? Something good that would justify the risk?\n \n \n\n There is a reason we don't have anarchy in this country, and the reason is that we have limits on what people can do. Your solution here is to take yet one other tool the people have to limit things going too far , away from them. \n\n Actually the bill adds another limit to what people can do. It removes a tool the people can use to limit government, but that doesn't lead to anarchy. Your solution is to take a limit away, thus letting people muck with the constitution even more easily. Your plan tends more towards anarchy than mine. Unless you're trying to argue that letting people change laws more easily leads to stability? If so, I don't see that at all.\n \n \n\n I don't think you understand. If there's a case where it's LEGAL (your standard for civil rights) to have assault weapons (and there are such cases), then that's a civil right. Your view essentially prevents that from being taken away by petition if the people feel it is necessary. This is just an example. There are lots of cases where this could come back to bite those who are for it.\n\n No, I'm afraid it's you who don't understand.

   "Like I said, a fascinating topic deserving of its own thread, since it isn't relevant to this discussion.\n\n \n I think it's very relevant right here. As I said, I'd like to know if you are certain that the initiative doesn't involve the possibility of limiting action against the civil rights under your definition #1 (the more arbitrary one). That's what I'm concerned with. It is the initiative we're talking about, and so there is nothing off-topic about that.\n \n \nNo, not everything is clearly defined, only things that are actually relevant. \n\n \n No one is saying otherwise. I'm not sure that matters at all here. There is enough concern over challenging things that relevant and legal to not even need to get into irrelevant ones. So I have no idea why you would bring up irrelevant issues. If it's irrelevant, it won't come up. \n \n \nDon't you see what you're doing there? Even you aren't actually willing to call it a reason, you keep calling it a \"reason/motivation/problem\". You aren't addressing anything on the grounds laid out, you're playing word games.\n\n \n I'm doing that because I'm trying to include everything you've called it, in your attempts to avoid having to call it a reason. These are the things you've asserted about fraud, and I'm merely trying to be inclusive of our view of it. Really, the difference is minimal. Personally, I think you're really grasping at straws by trying to get away from the idea that the article uses fraud as a reason here. But I'm willing to let you have that for your sake, because it really doesn't change anything. Call it what you want--an example, a reason, a motivation, etc ... the point doesn't change by quibbling over terminology. No matter what you call it, fraud make a poor basis or exampe over which to limit democracy (petitions).\n \n \nWe've seen rights taken away with bad results, can you show me where rights were prevented from being taken away with bad results?\n\n \n Ah, but now you're moving away from definition #2 for civil rights (that it's legal) and inching into definition #1, the arbitrary one. This is exactly why I expressed concern in my opening paragraph of this post. You see, \"bad results\" gets into opinion and interpretation. So which is it? Are you going to base it on what's legal (your def #2) or interpretation of circumstances? \n \n \nThat's really your argument here, right? You want to make it easy for the people to strips rights from others, you seem to think this is a necessary tool.\n\n \n \"Easy\"? I said nothing about it needing to be easy. The petition process is not necessarily easy. In fact, at least it doesn't completely rely on individuals (legislators) who may or many not do the will of the people, and who simply need to bring forth a bill and vote! Now THAT'S easy. But yes, society needs this tool, for the reasons I've given you.\n \n \nWe know that giving the people this tool can be harmful, look at the history of the south. Can you show anything to balance that danger? Something good that would justify the risk?\n\n \n It CAN be. But it can also be beneficial. Petitions have been used for centuries--it's a pretty normal part of democracy.\n \n \nThis bill would only prevent petitions that seek to amend the constitution to strip civil rights. \n\n \n Based on current law (your def #2), or someone arbitrarily saying \"this is my civil right\"? Or both? That's what I can't seem to get you to answer. If it's just #2, I'm fine with it. Naturally, rights granted by specific laws shouldn't be just taken away. In other words, someone shouldn't be able to float a petition to circumvent the Civil Rights Act.\n \n \nAnd you've alluded to this a few times. A civil right is a right granted by the government, it's not just a law. Just because something is legal doesn't make it a right. And it's not \"my\" standard for civil rights, I'm using the general definition. From wikipedia:\n \"Civil rights are the protections and privileges of personal power given to all citizens by law.\" If you take exception with the definition then say so, but don't pretend that I'm just making things up.\n\n \n No, you said there were 2 (two) meanings, not just one. (\"civil rights\" has two distinct, yet related, meanings. One deals with what you might call \"innate rights\", and is based on the concept that people should be treated equally.\") #2 was something granted (specifically) by the govt. This is what YOU said, not wikipedia, unless you wish to quote your source for saying what you said.",

   "This is a printer-friendly version of an article from the Concord Monitor at http://www.concordmonitor.com.\n \n Article published Apr 26, 2007\n No plebiscite needed: Lynch right on unions\n \n \n \n Monitor staff\n Apr 26, 2007\n \n A\n righteous refrain, heard before in debates over school funding, casino gambling and gay marriage, is being sounded once again by opponents of civil unions. \"Let the people decide!\" cries the chorus of those who want a public vote to decide the issue. But that's not how the system works.\n \n New Hampshire is probably the most representative democracy on Earth. Its 1.3 million residents are represented by a governor, 424 legislators and a five-member Executive Council. It neither is nor should be a referendum state, where laws are routinely adopted or discarded with a popular vote.\n \n In 1999, the state Supreme Court unanimously rejected then-Gov. Jeanne Shaheen's plan to hold a referendum to decide how to raise money to pay for schools. Referendum supporters cited Article 28 of the state constitution, which says no tax should be levied \"without the consent of the people.\"\n \n That sounds straightforward enough. But citizens give that consent, the court ruled, by voting for legislators and granting them \"full power and authority (to) make, ordain, and establish, all manner of wholesome and reasonable\" laws and tax decisions.\n \n The state constitution balances power among the people, the Legislature and the chief executive. The \"consent of the people\" phrase, the court said, appears elsewhere in the document. If interpreted broadly, it could be used to submit any law to a public vote. That would not be constitutional, in accord with history and case law, or wise.\n Voters, with the concurrence of the governor and two-thirds of the Legislature, have the power to amend the constitution. Other than that, power to make laws resides in elected officials answerable to the people.\n \n About a third of the 400-member House changes every two years. Work hard and stick around long enough, and pretty much anyone can take a seat and push the red and green voting buttons in Representatives Hall to enact or reject laws.\n \n Civil union opponents overstate their case when they claim that the public is on their side. Poll numbers vary and, as always, depend on how the question is phrased. But the state appears to be roughly evenly split on the issue, with women far more likely to support civil unions than men. Most people probably spend little or no time worrying about the issue since it doesn't affect them.\n \n The fate of a bill that will make New Hampshire the fourth state to legalize civil unions now rests with the Senate, which is nearly certain to pass it, and Gov. John Lynch. He was right to let the debate play out before making his position clear. That helped to assure a fairer hearing for opponents of the bill.\n \n Now Lynch has announced that he will sign rather than veto the bill or let it become law without his signature.\n \n \"I believe it is a matter of conscience, fairness and preventing discrimination,\" Lynch said.\n \n His approval will help the state ease into a transition that was right and inevitable. The march toward equal rights for all can be slowed or dealt setbacks, but it can't and shouldn't be stopped.\n \n ------ End of article\n \n Monitor editorial\n This article is: 0 days old.",
