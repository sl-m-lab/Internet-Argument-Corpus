   "I have a question for you. Saddam's son has rejected the ultimatum offered to him by our President saying, \"The wives and mothers of those Americans who will fight us will cry blood, not tears,\" he said. \"They should not imagine that they will have a safe spot inside the land of Iraq or outside it.\" Does this not confirm the suspicions that we have had all along about Iraq's ties to terrorism? Isn't this a direct threat to the American people? Is he not saying that they will use terrorist networks to harm the families of the soldiers that are there to liberate Baghdad, by unleashing one of the deadly poisons they have been manufacturing? Furthermore, there has been an intelligence report that provides information about Saddam's order to use chemical weapons in the field, against any U.S. led invasion. Do these revelations convince you that you are backing the wrong side in this conflict? Can you not see that we have been right, all along? Iraq has these weapons, and is now making statements alluding to the fact that they are in fact connected to various terrorist organizations. These connections have been detailed over the years:\n \n 1.) Iraq and Iran fund Palestinian Terrorists.\n \n 2.) WashingtonPost.com reports Al Qaeda was given nerve agents by Iraq.\n \n 3.) Ex-director of the CIA, Woolsey, believes that Al Qaeda played a role in the 9-11 attacks. He points to the refined anthrax attacks, which occurred shortly after 9-11 to support the idea that 9-11 was state sponsored.\n \n 4.) Terror camps in both Afghanistan and Iraq were run by Zarqawi. These camps dealt with poisonous material specifically. The kind of poisons that were probably given to the terror networks by Iraqi Intelligence. Zarqawi is being harbored by Hussein in Northern parts of Iraq, and has since received medical treatment in Baghdad. The terror group that operates in Northern Iraq has ties to Iraqi Intelligence, and is one of the strongest links recently named by Colin Powell in his address to the U.N..\n \n 5.) Iraq has long been a state sponsor of terrorism, and was the only Arab country that did not condemn the 9-11 attacks. Iraq has an extensive training program in Salman Pak, where they train both Iraqi agents and foreign terrorists. The training includes the hijacking of various public transportation modes, explosives in urban areas, and assassinations. Iraq has a complete Boeing 707 on sight to aid in their training program.\n \n source: The State Department\n \n 6.) Spain recently linked 9-11 suspect to Baghdad \"An alleged terrorist accused of helping the 11 September conspirators was invited to a party by the Iraqi ambassador to Spain under his al-Qaeda nom de guerre, according to documents seized by Spanish investigators.\"\n \n 7.) Czechs confirm the belief that Atta had met with a key member of Iraqi intelligence.\n \n 8.) Evidence indicates that Iraq planned to conduct attacks on U.S. warships in the Persian Gulf. Strikingly similar to the an actual attack that occurred in the Gulf of Yemen in late 2000, the Christian Science Monitor reported the allegations made by a former smuggler. \"The alleged plan involved loading at least one trade ship with half a ton of explosives, and - sailing under an Iranian flag to disguise Iraq's role - using a crew of suicide bombers to blow up a U.S. ship in the Gulf.\"\n \n 9.) Ramsey Yousef was the mastermind that attempted the first World Trade Center Bombing. His ties to both Al Qaeda and Iraq have been well documented.\n \n 10.) In 1995, Manila police arrested Ramsey Yousef. His co-conspirator Murad admitted links to Al Qaeda, and discussed a plot to use planes in a suicide bombing, targeting CIA headquarters. Murad spoke of the fact that Al Qaeda operatives were being trained in U.S. flight schools for a conspiracy that included blowing up 12 U.S. planes over the Pacific Ocean.\n \n Obviously, there exists a long history of Iraqi terrorism, their ties to Al Qaeda, and even evidence that suggests Iraq was involved in the 9-11 conspiracy. Saddam has placed great importance on his chemical, biological , and nuclear programs. Saddam has killed more Muslims than any other person, approximately 1.5 million. Saddam tried to assassinate Bush, after he left office. Saddam celebrated the attacks on 9-11, and was probably behind it. None of these crimes could have been committed without the use of Iraqi intelligence and top leaders in Iraq's upper echelon. Not only are we after Hussein, but also the command structure that implements the dreams of a madman. Even if he were to leave today, it is necessary to remove all those who have a vested interest to the current Iraqi government. \n \n We have three reasons for removing Saddam and his regime. First, the liberation of the Iraqi people is important. Secondly, we must further disrupt the Al Qaeda network, which has gotten plenty of support from Hussein in the past. The connection between Iraq and terrorist networks makes the possibility of a chemical or bioterror event more likely, as he has developed these weapons. In fact, there is a belief among experts in biological weaponry that the Anthrax used in the variety of attacks on news agencies, Washington officials, and postal workers has an Iraqi fingerprint. Last, Saddam had a role on September 11, whatever the degree.\n \n Trust in the U.S. armed forces to eliminate this threat with minimal civilian casualties. Already they have been broadcasting instructions to the Iraqi people, detailing what they can do to avert disaster. Our armed forces are the most professional military organization in the world. We can trust in this professionalism, and be comforted in the fact that only Saddam Hussein will be responsible for the loss civilian lives. Why some would defend his position is beyond comprehension.",

   "Here's something i found floating around the net <\n \n \n \n -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Finally: Osama/Hussein Link Exposed \n \n Powell Offers Proof of Saddam-Osama Link, March 27, 2003 \n by Gil Christner \n UNITED NATIONS - Secretary of State Colin Powell today offered incontrovertible proof of the long-sought-after link between Saddam Hussein's Regime and the al Qaeda Terrorist Network. \n In a speech before the General Assembly, General Powell was able to show, through a series of \"degrees of separation,\" how Hussein was merely 6 people away from Osama bin Laden, leader of al Qaeda. Using charts, graphs, and all AV equipment available to the U.N., Powell presented his case to the General Assembly and the entire world, which was watching via television cameras. \n \n Never rambling or tentative, a confident Sec. Powell spoke with a voice of authority, outlining the solid connection between the leader of Iraq and the group of terrorists deemed \"the most dangerous people to Humanity\" by Fox News Network. The series of charts and graphs were presented in 14 different languages, including Farsi, Aramaic and German. French was inexplicably left out of the languages used. \n \n In sum, here are Gen. Powell's arguments: \n 1. In December of 2002, actor Sean Penn went to Baghdad, home of \n Saddam Hussein. \n 2. Sean Penn is married to actress Robin Wright Penn \n 3. Robin Wright Penn made the movie \"Forrest Gump\" with Tom Hanks. \n 4. Tom Hanks made the film \"Apollo 13\" with Kevin Bacon. \n 5. Kevin Bacon made a Visa card commercial with Indian-born character actor Sahid Benjali. \n 6. Sahid Benjali used to bartend at the Lingerie Club in Hollywood. In the early 80's he served drinks to Carmen bin Laden, a former USC student, who is Osama's sister-in-law. \n \n After Gen. Powell's presentation, there were several heated \n discussions, with many of the delegates making angry responses, some of which were not too flattering to the case being made. \n \"6 degrees? Fah!\" said Ahmad Abul Gheit, the delegate from Egypt. \"I can get from Saddam to Osama in 5 people! Including Madonna!\" \"5 people? I can do it in four,\" retorted Elinor Hammarskjold, the Swedish delegate. \"And I don't need to use Kevin Bacon! Just give me the Farrelly Brothers and a pool boy in Bel-Air!\" Where upon the entire floor of the U.N. erupted into arguments. \n \n Eventually the winner emerged: Tanzania delegate Mark J. Mwando was able to get from Saddam to Osama in 2 steps: \n 1. In 1983, Saddam Hussein met with then U.S. Envoy Donald Rumsfeld, working on behalf of the Ronald Reagan-George Bush Sr. administration, to arm Iraq against Iran. \n 2. George Bush Sr. was formerly the head of the CIA, the organization which armed Osama bin Laden and provided training to his followers in the 80's. \n \n For coming up with the winning entry, Delegate Mwando was treated to a party platter from the Carnegie Deli on 7th Ave. \"This is wonderful,\" Mwando said as he munched on a dill pickle. \n Sec. of Defense Donald Rumsfeld could not be reached for comment. \n -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

   "In order to monitor how accurate my previous assumption was, and to determine whether or not my backing of this war was justified, one need only to look as far as today's headlines. \n \n The most disturbing feature is the lack of a significant find with respect to WMD. \n \n I am sure all the arrests we are making will yield excellent results in the area. At least the United States has not damaged their credibility by falsifying evidence. We know they had them and it is going to take some time to uncover those weapons, or Saddam has moved these weapons to other countries. Certainly, it is important to find the caches, so we can confirm what we had been saying about the Iraqi regime to justify the war prior to action.\n \n Al Qaeda terrorists seen in Iraq\n \n Iraq Al Qaeda connection found by The Telegraph\n \n Tawfiq Attash Khallad, wanted for the U.S.S. Cole bombing, was arrested today. Pakistani officials say that they helped to avert a major terrorist attack\n \n Nations named in the State Department's \"Patterns of Global Terrorism: 2002\" document have done nothing to distance themselves from terrorism. Don't worry Iran is in the cross-hairs.\n \n Terrorism is at an all time low\n \n As you can see the Bush strategy to combat terrorism has been most effective. The war couldn't have gone any smoother, and we are well on the way to pulling our troops out of Saudi Arabia. As anyone can see, the strategic move of knocking out Iraq is going to forever change the face of that region, and its relationship with terrorist organizations. We are now in an excellent position to pressure both Iran and Syria. Now it is only a matter of time before the domino effect of democracy does serious damage to the autocratic regimes in many of fundamentalist states in the Middle East.\n \n There exists no reason to attack Pakistan since they have been very helpful inthe war on terrorism. As for the claim that the U.S. supplied Iraq with WMD, somebody needs to do a little more research on the matter, as it is clear that they do not know what they are talking about. Look it up. Start at the American Type Culture Association. Notice the purpose of their organization, which sent biological samples to Iraq inthe 1980's. Then read more about the nature of the research that was supposed to be conducted with these samples, before you shoot your mouth off, and start suggesting that the U.S. government was complicit in Iraq's weapons programs. I think you will find that the actions you are trying to attribute to the U.S. government represent actions the French have taken, and not America.\n \n Why do you hate America, Libertarian?",

Nearly all of them have at least some white ancestry, as do ashkenazi jews.\n \n Persians come from the same ethnic group as Sephardic Jews (in fact, many Sephardic jews come from Iran.)

Do you have any idea?\n \n I'm guessing jealousy. As was so aptly put by Chaz Bufe, in the American Heretics Dictionary \"Anti-semitism, n.: A blind, unreasoning hatred of Jewish people by those who fear, with good reason, that they are inferior to jews. This is not to say that Jews are inherantly superior to anyone else, even anti-semites; rather, that Jewish culture encourages self responsibilty, social responsibilty, learning, dedication to goals, and individual achievement- things sorely lacking in the mainstream of...cultrue. Hence, Jews tend to be percieved as threatening 'overachievers'...\" (and before you ask, no he isnt jewish.)\n Of course another reason, more currently applicable, is that arab nations don't like a democracy sprouting in their back yard. Makes dictating kinda a difficult when arab standards of living are 4x higher west of the jordan than east of it.\n \nAs for the current war, i can find no more compelling pivotal reason than the emotional connection that so many US administration officials have for the state of israel.

Oil is more compelling reason than an \"emotional connection\" to a strip of land the size of Vancouver Island. As is liberating an oppressed people, killing off a dictator, revenge for Gulf war I. Even if they are misguided, they are all more compelling. And as for the Iran/Syria link, you could make that link for virtually every country in Europe, the middle east, and north africa. The fact that another country is enemies with Israel does not, de facto, make that country a good nation. I'm sure even minus the existance of Israel, we could find plenty of reasons to want to take out Syria and Iran (mass slaughters of innocents being one big one.)",

   "Aryana,\n \n * I don't know what is your point here. There are white Jews, black Jews (Ethiuopian Jews), etc. A race has to do with the color of your skin. Jews cannot be a race because they have different ancestor backgrounds, and different \"colors\".\n \n * If your mother and father are Christians, what does it make you then? That's right... Religion depends on what side you were born at. OF COURSE it has to do with ancestry. But much more than that. You're making it sound like a bad thing when actually it's just something that happens with ALL religions. And BTW, if a person converts, the Law of Return is granted to him even if his ancestry has nothing to do with Judaism.\n \n * When you go 2000 years ago, Jews have common ancestry. If you go only 1500 years ago, only Europian Jews will have that common ancestry. If you trace back humanity to its roots, it is believed to be started in Africa. Do you call an Asian African? No... That's why Jews have common ancestry that is the desendants of the Hebrews. But inside the modern Jewish community of today they have different cultures and roots. This doesn't mean that the ancient roots are not the ones of the Israelites.\n \n * What you have shown here is that the ancient Hebrews have mingled with other peoples of the area. Soooooo what's your point.....?\n \n \n If your main point is that Jews rarely inter-breed, then I guess you're right. That still doesn't mean that some Jews are white and most are darker skinned... I live in Israel and been to other places in the world. Ashkenazi Jews are just as white as any other Europians. Perhaps not as the Scandinavian for instance, but they are still white.\n \n I hope I made myself clear with my points since English isn't my first language. However, your sources for information of Judaism are very wrong and misleading. I would even say anti-Semitic. Jews did not cause the war with Iraq. Grow up, and compare what you're saying to what the Nazis used to say about Jews after Germany lost WW1.",

Such apostate is equivalent to an internal revolution within the Islamic society. If such a person confines his apostate to himself, and does not proclaim, he is left to Allah (subhanahu wa ta'ala). Allah (subhanahu wa ta'ala) knows best who believes and who rejects the faith. Muslims can only base their judgements, sentences, and apparent matters and leave the realties to Allah (subhanahu wa ta'ala). \n \n A person who rejects the Islamic faith may be given a chance for three consecutive days to return to the fold of Islam. Matured Islamic scholars must sit with him and explain to him the major sin he is committing against his own soul, his family and the community. If this person returns to the fold of Islam he will be let free. If not he will be executed. Killing such an apostate is, in reality, a salvation for the rest of the society members.\"\n http://www.islamcall.com/rights_misco.htm\n \n \n \"Apostasy - \"According to Muslim Law, a male apostate, or murtadd, is liable to be put to death if he continue obstinate in his error; a female apostate is not subject to capital punishment, but she may be kept in confinement until she recant. If either the husband or the wife apostatize from the faith of Islam, a divorce takes place ipso facto; the wife is entitled to her whole dower, but no sentence of divorce is necessary. If the husband and wife both apostatize together, their marriage is generally allowed to continue, although Imam Zufar says if either husband or wife were singly to return to Islam, then the marriage would be dissolved. \n According to Abu Hanifah, a male apostate is disabled from selling or otherwise disposing of his property. But Abu Yusuf and Imam Muhammad differ from their master on this point, and consider a male apostate to be as competent to exercise every right as if he were still in the faith. \n If a boy under age apostatize, he is not to be put to death, but to be imprisoned until he come to full age, when, if he continues in the state of unbelief, he must be put to death. Neither lunatics nor drunkards are held to be responsible for their apostasy from Islam. If a person upon compulsion became an apostate, his wife is not divorced, nor are his lands forfeited. If a person become a Mussulman [i.e. Muslim] upon compulsion, and afterwards apostatize, he is not to be put to death. \n The will of a male apostate is not valid, but that of a female apostate is valid. \n Ikrimah relates that some apostates were brought to the Khalifa Ali, and he burnt them alive; but Ibn Abbas heard of it and said that the Khalifa had not acted rightly, for the Prophet had said \"Punish not with God's punishment (i.e., fire), but whosoever changes his religion, kill him with the sword.\"\n http://www.muslim-canada.org/apostasy.htm\n \n \n With such pressures placed on persons, coming from one's own family and community, then one can only speculate what would happen should such restrictions be lifted. Even in Great Britain, just recently a Muslim man was convicted for killing his daughter who was seeing a Christian.",
