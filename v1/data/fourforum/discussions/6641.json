She is really into all of Joss Wheadons creations(Buffy, Angel etc) so I had low expectations.\n \n It surprised me how good the interaction between the various characters was written and it had a decent story as well. The film has made me want to revisit the Firefly Universe(I will hopefully get into this time) and the DVD boxset is the first thing I will purchase when I get paid.\n \n Overall I would give it a 4/5. Witty and Intelligent Sci-fi for once.",

If I have never seen the series on TV, can I still get into the movie without a lot of \"Who's that guy?\" and \"Wait, who's that?\"\n In other words, is there decent exposition or is it like the X-Files movie which was picking up were the previous season had left off and before the new season had begun? Or do they treat it like a some what seperate intaty like any other movie based off of a TV show?",

There are a few instances where you may be confused, but it is a good movie for the fact that you can watch it without ever having heard of Firefly and get just about everything.",
