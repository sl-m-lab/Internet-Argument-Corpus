   "'Americans oblivious to suffering'\n Carter blames U.S., again - this time for world's problems\n \n Posted: February 23, 2004\n 1:00 a.m. Eastern\n \n \u00a9 2004 WorldNetDaily.com \n \n WASHINGTON - Former President Jimmy Carter, who blamed Americans for the country's \"malaise\" during his term of office, has once again pointed the finger at his countrymen in a speech in Minnesota. \n \n Speaking at St. Olaf College Saturday, Carter said Americans are indifferent to the suffering of others around the world. \n \n \"The problem lies among the people of the U.S.,\" he said. \"It's a different world from ours. And we don't really care about what happens to them.\" \n \n He said the U.S. is a \"great country, with great potential,\" but simply isn't doing what it could to bring peace, freedom and health to the developing world. \n \n Carter said that \"despite glorious speeches in Washington\" pledging AIDS relief in Africa, some nations are actually getting less aid than they once did. \n \n While blaming the Bush administration specifically for squandering opportunities to help people in trouble, he also held the American people responsible. \n \n \"It's time to assess what the government is doing and shape and influence it appropriately,\" he said. \n \n Carter's \"malaise\" speech in 1980, in which he blamed the American people for a sagging economy and low morale, is often cited as his political demise. He was defeated in a bid for re-election that year by Ronald Reagan.",
