   "Is the \"creationist\" movement part of a broad movement for fundamentalists to weild political power? Do many fundamentalists think that only teaching evolution is an attack on taking the bible literally, which is an attack on their attempts to base laws on a strict intererptation of the bible on issues such as abortion and gay marriage? Are there a large fraction of gay marriage/abortion supporters that are glad that science classes contradict the old testament because this attacks the postion of their opponents? I personally think that most people that want science classes to exclusively teach evolution are not thinking about the way faith or aethism change peoples outlook. On the other people who want children to be taught the contraversy are thinking about the consequences they think a lack of faith brings.",

If its acceptable for evolution, where does one draw a line in the future? All science is then open to such treatment. Who knows where the YEC's might place their next campaign?\n \n We do not need Creationism to be taught in science because there are otherways people can find out about it.\n \n \n Re: political power I'm sure this is very relevant in the USA. I'm not that savvy on Bush's quotes on creation, but I bet he is careful not to say anything that makes him seem to favour evolution.",
