   "I didn't want to rip off the book title too much :)\n \n So some more budgeting news out this week. Obama gave us his pathetic budget, the republicans told us their $100 billion plan, the democrats in congress think 100 billion is too much, and people are rioting over the Wisconsin governor balancing the budget. \n \n Let me first explain our federal problem and why the democrats don't get it and why the republicans get it and don't care. $100 billion is less than 3% of what we annually spend each year. If we were only in a deficit to the tune of $500 billion a year that might be something to be somewhat cheer about. Sadly, the deficit is going up close to 2 trillion a year. Even more if you count debt held by the public (social security). So the republicans just threw us some table scraps and think we will be happy. On the other side of the fence we have the \"don't cut xxxxx program, it will hurt the kids\" party. Perhaps those who think we shouldn't cut something are willing to raise the tax rates by 100-200%. Good luck collecting taxes on the middle class with a tax rate of 50%. \n \n The real solution is to cut $500 billion this year alone from every program out there. Sorry but the people on Medicare and Social Security now should have known that they can't spend money and claim they are saving it at the same time while adding to their benefits. For those in the military, tough, your budget is cut in half. I can just about guarantee that if you are not a federal employee/contractor that cutting the federal budget in half over 3-5 years will not harm you one bit other than the tanking of the economy that will occur for a few years. Oops, shoulda thought about that before the government took over so much of the economy. \n \n Ok, so now that we have established the liberals to incompetent and the republicans to be unethical we can look at the situation in Wisconsin.\n \n I support the governor on this issue 100% even if he is just trying to hurt unions. Apparently when given the choice between getting paid more or firing your coworker the teachers of Wisconsin prefer to fire their coworker. What class. States actually have to run a balanced budget for the most part. Labor makes up the vast majority of costs. The Governor gave a choice, either stop trying to screw our state over or we'll just lay people off. Every state has done this. The people in Wisconsin (some of them) are just babies and need to grow up and understand they aren't entitled to a pension when their is no funding for it. You don't see state employees protesting in my state and we are basically doing the same thing. Virginians understand that it's either concede a little no or a lot later.",

   "I actually DO have a little glimmer of hope here. It seems like people are actually fairly knowledgeable about the situation. I have actually been asking around about this...everybody from multi millionaires to bulldozer operators to the lady that serves me coffee at the cafe I frequent for breakfast. For the most part everybody I have spoken to understands the situation a lot better than I expected. They all seem to understand the consequences of a government shutdown and none of them seem to really care. It is like they are so fed up with uncle sam that they are pretty much willing to bear the pain just to see the government suffer worse. \n \n As far as what is going on in Wisconsin (soon coming to a state near you), the state workers are shooting themselves in the foot. This is exactly what happened with the autoworkers when the big 3 were in trouble. They expected the american people to stand with them and instead when the details of what kind of pay and benefits they were getting came to light, the American people pretty much gave them the bird. State employees in a lot of states are in the same boat. While their pay may not be much higher than a similar job in the private sector, their benefits and health care are just plain awesome. If anything the rallies and protests they are carrying out are going to hurt them as more information about their benefit programs gets thrust into the spotlight. \n \n I still think that the folks who are going to end up being demonized in the event of a shutdown are the politicians who fail to accept the spending cuts.",

   "Yeah, it does seem like more and more people understand the budget situation. One BIG problem I still see is that people think \"fraud, waste, and abuse\" amount to trillions in spending a year, even at the state level. I'm extremely familiar with my states finances and can tell you that fraud, waste, and abuse is fairly low. That is not to say the state is doing things it shouldn't be doing but those are in plan sight and they are done at the lowest cost they could be done at. State universities, as always, are a great example. They are run at the lowest cost possible for what we want them to be which is mostly awesome buildings, \"quality\" professors, and good sports teams. \n \n On the federal side fraud, waste, and abuse is much more prevalent since budgeting is an irrelevant task. Nevertheless, the savings from removing that would barely make a debt in the deficit...this includes the much higher wages of federal employees (I'd make over double if I worked for the feds...and I make a lot now).\n \n Once people understand that cutting entire services is what is needed and that removing them probably won't stink as bad as you might think then we can really get somewhere.",

Today people seem to recognize that balancing the budget by eliminating earmarks is like trying to pay your mortgage by saving your pocket change at the end of each day. \n \n As far as the political situation goes it seems like both sides are pretty much just trying to hold out until 2012 to make any real changes. The tea baggers are forcing the issue, and frankly I think it is amusing to see the democrats and republicans, both of whom have spent a substantial amount of time wagging fingers at each other when it comes to fiscal responsibility, having to band together to nullify the tea baggers, who want actual cuts. \n \n We face unprecedented challenges here. We have to cut our spending drastically in order to survive as a nation. At the same time, we drastically need to update our infrastructure in order to stay competitive in the world economy. That is one area where I think Obama is actually right. We need high speed rail. We need improvements in our internet infrastructure. We need to upgrade our power grid. Right now we are trying to compete in a digital world using 1950s infrastructure. That has to change if the US is going to remain competitive in the world market.",

   "I'd be interesting in what some of our more liberal members think such as Jitobear, Xcal, etc. I ask because the polls still indicate that people want things cut but only things they don't like. The Doc Jones's (his personality, not him) of the world seem to think we can increase the military and still balance the budget or not raise taxes and still balance the budget. Frankly, I'm all for lower taxes but I understand the need to raise them first to get us out of this hole. Hell, I'd even make the tax rates conditional. \n \n You seem to be more optimistic than I am.

We do need to cut spending , but I believe we need to cut areas that will not effect the economy in an adverse way. Chopping off off your arm so you can't reach your wallet doesn't solve the problem of paying your debts. We can cut programs that are not needed and save a few pennies here and there but until the Government comes to an agreement to Cut the big programs, the ones that will hurt, then we are never going to accomplish anything. \n \n First.. They need to reduce Military spending by 50%. We need to bring a swift end to the Wars in the Middle East and Withdraw our troops , then from there we can begin to reduce the size of our military and the Budget at the same time. \n \n Second.. We need massive cuts in Both Social Security and Medicare. We need to Overhaul Social Security and eliminate the wasteful spending practices that they have grown accustomed to. They could start by Cutting benefits for the top 10% , Eliminate the waiting period for People who apply for benefits, find more economical ways to reduce the ammount of fraud within the program, and increase the FICA rate by 2 to 5 %. That would be a good start. Medicare should be overhauled as well. They need to cut out the Middleman , Put an end to Medicare subsidies going to private insurance companies, Raise the requirement age to qualify for Medicare. A complete overhaul of the system. \n \n Third.. They MUST increase revenues. That seems to be the biggest problem we face. The Teabaggers and GOP seem to believe that we can Cut, Cut , Cut our way into solvency without raising taxes, but As far as I'm aware there is no Math that works for this scenario. Obama originally wanted to go back to the Clinton Age Tax code, which I believe was 39% for the Top 1%. That would be a 3 % increase but a massive increase in revenues. I firmly believe that they should not just pick on the rich here. They should raise taxes on everyone, 1 to 2 % increase across the board. Add a 5 % sales tax on fuel. Raise Corporate taxes. anything and everything to get the revenue flowing in .\n \n Until they address these three issues they are doing nothing more than grandstanding and wasting our time. We can't Cut all the things the Tea Party wants to cut AND increase spending on infrastructure. We have a dire need for High speed rail. We need to catch up with the rest of the world in technology. We can't do that without increasing spending in some areas. \n \n I personally think Of all the proposals for a budget currently being debated, Obamas Budget goes farther to solving our long term problems than the others. I understand that his budget isn't what most people wanted. He does not cut deep enough, and he also does not address the problems of the big three.",

Apparently some of the governors are too (for their respective states). It seems the ones not making the serious cuts are the ones who were already in congress..aka the leadersihp.\n \n \nWhat they are offering is cuts across the board, with no solutions to actually solving anything.

In other words they don't really have a clue what they are doing, just throwing out numbers to impress their voters and make it appear as if they are keeping a promise.\nWell of course it is dangerous to our economy. When the federal government is at least 25% of your GDP you are going to have to take a hit with the economy to get things back in line for the future.\n \n I think the point is people are starting to be ok with the hit so long as it helps in the long run. Personally I'm not convinced people are willing to do this but Daewoo is more optimistic than I.\n \n \nI agree with you , I also think Obama is right in this area. We do need to cut spending , but I believe we need to cut areas that will not effect the economy in an adverse way....First.. They need to reduce Military spending by 50%. \nThese two highlighted quotes don't fit well together. Cutting the military by 50% tanks the economy. Now I agree we SHOULD do this but the consequences are insane. In my state, Virginia, Norfolk would basically become Detroit overnight. Closed down factories, depressed economy, homeless everywhere. Military contracting is such a HUGE part of our economy that we basically have become dependent on it for \"growth\". \n \n \nSecond.. We need massive cuts in Both Social Security and Medicare. We need to Overhaul Social Security and eliminate the wasteful spending practices that they have grown accustomed to.\nSee my post above about this term. What exactly is this \"wasteful spending\" and why bother with it when it is most likely immaterial. Private companies are wasteful too but they don't worry about because it costs too much to find it and eliminate it. \n \n \nThey could start by Cutting benefits for the top 10% , Eliminate the waiting period for People who apply for benefits, find more economical ways to reduce the ammount of fraud within the program, and increase the FICA rate by 2 to 5 %. That would be a good start. Medicare should be overhauled as well. They need to cut out the Middleman , Put an end to Medicare subsidies going to private insurance companies, Raise the requirement age to qualify for Medicare. A complete overhaul of the system. \nI'd rather just get rid of Medicare Part C and D AND raise the tax threshold (currently limited to just under $100k). No one paid for Medicare Part C or D, why should they get the benefits?\n \n \nThird.. They MUST increase revenues. That seems to be the biggest problem we face. The Teabaggers and GOP seem to believe that we can Cut, Cut , Cut our way into solvency without raising taxes, but As far as I'm aware there is no Math that works for this scenario.\n No realistic way. You could just cut 50+% of the budget out and not raise a dime but you wanted to limit the economic impact, which I agree we should, so temporary increases in tax rates should be used. I'd be happy with conditional tax rates. Tax rates are \"x\" until the budget is balanced unless a war is DECLARED. Tax rates are \"x\" until debt is below 20-25% of GDP. Likewise, if they do REALLY good you can lower tax rates if you come in under budget or debt is 15-20% of GDP. \n \n \nObama originally wanted to go back to the Clinton Age Tax code, which I believe was 39% for the Top 1%. That would be a 3 % increase but a massive increase in revenues. I firmly believe that they should not just pick on the rich here. They should raise taxes on everyone, 1 to 2 % increase across the board. Add a 5 % sales tax on fuel. Raise Corporate taxes. anything and everything to get the revenue flowing in .\nI disagree with corporate taxes. They don't raise that much revenue and Google can afford to pay guys to make their tax rate 3%. The extremely rich can do the same (top .1%) which is why the 2nd or 3rd most rich folks pay the highest tax rate (those between 200k-1million a year in income). Anyway, I say just tax the rich...no one else has money. The Middle Class is tapped out after buying their worthless homes.\n \n \nI personally think Of all the proposals for a budget currently being debated, Obamas Budget goes farther to solving our long term problems than the others.\nIs this a joke? His budget raised spending. He \"cuts the deficit\" by projecting obscene growth rates. That's like you going home, finding out your spending habits have caused you to rack up thousands of dollars in credit card debt and you call up the credit card company and say \"don't worry, I plan on getting 10% pay raises over the next decade so don't worry about be not paying my bills right now\". \n \n Obama's plan is to freeze spending at CURRENT levels for 5 years. He then proposes to cut defense by 1.5% each year for 5 years. He also cuts some $24 billion in programs which is an insulting .5% of the budget. Meanwhile states have cut 5-20% from each area for the past 3 years running (well, the well-run states have). This, apparently, will cut our deficit by $1 trillion by 2017 assuming growth rates of 6% or more (2009 had a .6% growth rate for reference and we haven't had 6% growth since the 80s I believe). \n \n Sorry but when Obama's budget came out it make the House Republicans plan look genius...which is embarrassing.",

Until he put that on the table, nobody was talking across the board cuts. \n \n \n \nI agree with you , I also think Obama is right in this area. We do need to cut spending , but I believe we need to cut areas that will not effect the economy in an adverse way. Chopping off off your arm so you can't reach your wallet doesn't solve the problem of paying your debts. We can cut programs that are not needed and save a few pennies here and there but until the Government comes to an agreement to Cut the big programs, the ones that will hurt, then we are never going to accomplish anything. \n \n First.. They need to reduce Military spending by 50%. We need to bring a swift end to the Wars in the Middle East and Withdraw our troops , then from there we can begin to reduce the size of our military and the Budget at the same time. \n\n \n Cutting military spending by 10% would cut about 10% out of our GDP and cost us millions of jobs. \n \n There is no way out of this without significant pain. NONE. Anybody who tells you otherwise is lying to you. \n \n \nSecond.. We need massive cuts in Both Social Security and Medicare. We need to Overhaul Social Security and eliminate the wasteful spending practices that they have grown accustomed to. They could start by Cutting benefits for the top 10% , Eliminate the waiting period for People who apply for benefits, find more economical ways to reduce the ammount of fraud within the program, and increase the FICA rate by 2 to 5 %. That would be a good start. Medicare should be overhauled as well. They need to cut out the Middleman , Put an end to Medicare subsidies going to private insurance companies, Raise the requirement age to qualify for Medicare. A complete overhaul of the system. \n\n \n They also need to do away with social security disability completely. SS as a pension fund can actually work. SS as a pension fund with a huge non pension disability outlay cannot. You cannot combine your disability fund with your pension fund. If you do the fund goes broke. Every time. \n \n \nThird.. They MUST increase revenues. That seems to be the biggest problem we face. The Teabaggers and GOP seem to believe that we can Cut, Cut , Cut our way into solvency without raising taxes, but As far as I'm aware there is no Math that works for this scenario. Obama originally wanted to go back to the Clinton Age Tax code, which I believe was 39% for the Top 1%. That would be a 3 % increase but a massive increase in revenues. I firmly believe that they should not just pick on the rich here. They should raise taxes on everyone, 1 to 2 % increase across the board. Add a 5 % sales tax on fuel. Raise Corporate taxes. anything and everything to get the revenue flowing in .\n\n \n Even with MASSIVE cuts, a 1-2% tax increase is a JOKE. Try more like 20% to start. A 50% increase would be even better. \n \n \nUntil they address these three issues they are doing nothing more than grandstanding and wasting our time. We can't Cut all the things the Tea Party wants to cut AND increase spending on infrastructure. We have a dire need for High speed rail. We need to catch up with the rest of the world in technology. We can't do that without increasing spending in some areas. \n \n I personally think Of all the proposals for a budget currently being debated, Obamas Budget goes farther to solving our long term problems than the others. I understand that his budget isn't what most people wanted. He does not cut deep enough, and he also does not address the problems of the big three.\n\n \n His budget is not just \"not what most people wanted\", it is a complete and utter joke. It is a pathetic exercise in faux fiscal discipline. It is pathetic. \n \n What it boils down to is that we need DEEPER cuts in social programs in order to be able to funnel the money we do have into activities that actually show a return on investment. If you are running a company you pay your payroll before you start figuring bonuses. Same thing here. We make our infrastructure investments BEFORE we fund massive social programs. It does not work the other way around. \n \n These are the \"tough decisions\" that politicians like to harp on but never actually make. If you cant afford to pay your mortgage and buy your kid a pony, you pay the mortgage. \n \n The democrats are going to have to give up their social programs and the republicans are going to have to give up their insanely high \"defense\" budget.",

The Number is 40 , 20 of which had to be earned in the last ten years. Here's the Social Security Web Site.. With the Data..\n \n an individual must have earned sufficient work credits in order to qualify for SSDI. The normal requirement is a total of 40 credits, 20 of which must have been earned in the 10 years prior to the onset of disability. Usually, this means that a person must have a fairly consistent work history and have worked (and paid Social Security taxes) for a combined five of the ten years prior to becoming disabled. \n \n SSDI Benefits\n \n \n\n SSI is 100% a welfare program. They do not even pretend you have to have worked for SSI. SSI, though, is funded from the general fund, NOT the social security taxes.\n \n \n I agree SSI is a 100% Welfare program. It's funded Separately from Normal SSDI. There are Limits to SSI though , As it's only for those with Low incomes. If your SSDI monthly Payment Exceeds 700 Dollars you don't qualify for SSI.

What a sucker I am for working!!\n \n \n Having gone through this myself 8 years ago I can assure you it's much more strict than that. I Fell 25 feet off a train car and landed on steel rails. Fractured 4 vertebra , ruptured 7 discs, fractured my left wrist, as well as blew out both knees . 26 surgeries later when I was told by my doctors I would never work again I filed for disability. It took me just over three years, three appeals, and a court hearing in front of a judge with letters from 15 doctors to convince them I was disabled. It's not as easy as just saying you can't do the work you did before, even if that is how they define it. \n \n \n\n That is how you end up with people with undocumentable back injuries on disability for their entire lives. In all honesty I know 4 people who are on SSDI and getting SSI. 3 of them are total scams. The fourth is not a scam, the guy is a paraplegic. He should still not be getting SSDI or SSI because frankly there are plenty of jobs he could do from his wheel chair. HE wont do it, though, because essentially the way the system is set up now it is all or nothing...if he goes back to work and something goes wrong and he realizes he cant do the job for some reason, he cant just go back on disability. This is a shame because he is one of the most gifted PLC programmers I have ever met.\n \n \n One of the biggest problems I have with the program is the ammount of Fraud involved. I also know people who are perfectly capable of working \"A\" job, but stay on disability because it's easier and they don't have to do anything. I am no longer in a wheelchair but still unable to work. I tried several times to return to work but I take Narcotic pain killers three times a day for life, no one would hire me because of the medications I was on I was considered a risk. A lot of people who have been disabled and attempt to return to work are treated as a risk, Especially if they were injured on their previous job. No one wants to hire a risk . I do agree there is a huge ammount of fraud and the Government could do more to stem this problem. \n \n \n\n Part of that problem, though, is the fact that we are trying to run our disability program with pension fund rules. You are either old or you are not. There is not a whole lot of middle ground there. The same cannot be said for a disability where there are a lot of shades of gray.\n\n \n Yeah I agree with this too. Disability and Retirement are not even close to being the same and should have separate guidelines. Whole point is we know there are problems with the Program, but what can we do to fix them ?. The Government seems settled on how it works now and most politicians are reluctant to make the necessary changes because the Voters are calling the shots. As long as the Voters are reluctant to change then we are stuck with what we have.",

   "Sorry Dude, but Your numbers are wrong.. The Number is 40 , 20 of which had to be earned in the last ten years. Here's the Social Security Web Site.. With the Data..\n \n an individual must have earned sufficient work credits in order to qualify for SSDI. The normal requirement is a total of 40 credits, 20 of which must have been earned in the 10 years prior to the onset of disability. Usually, this means that a person must have a fairly consistent work history and have worked (and paid Social Security taxes) for a combined five of the ten years prior to becoming disabled. \n \n SSDI Benefits\n\n \n Nope. First, that is not the social security web site. The SS web site is The United States Social Security Administration. Second, here is a link to the page where they explain how many credits you need for different ages:\n \n Work credits needed for disability benefits\n \n You can qualify with as few as SIX credits. \n \n \n\n Totally agree. Disability Should be funded separately, but as you have mentioned they have tried and failed to do that so far.\n\n \n If they have tried and failed, then we SHOULD NOT HAVE IT. The reason it failed was not that Americans are heartless bastards who want to see crippled people begging in the street. It was because nobody was able/willing to explain what definition they would be using for \"disabled\" and the american people are not dumb enough to give that kind of power to the government without such a definition in place beforehand. \n \n This is just another place where those in congress basically went \"screw the voters...we want it so we will make it happen even if the public opposes it\". \n \n \n \nHaving gone through this myself 8 years ago I can assure you it's much more strict than that.

If it is so hard to get on, how do we end up with so much fraud??? I live in a very poor county (poorest in the state by some measures) and I know a lot of families around here where everybody is on disability. They sign their kids up when they are 18. How are they doing it if it is that hard?? I am not doubting your story above because I know that the paraplegic I referenced above had to go to court several times to get his claim approved. \n \n It seems to me that the program is obviously BADLY broken when a paraplegic has to sue to get covered, but an entire family can get disability benefits when none of them are actually disabled. \n \n \n \nYeah I agree with this too.

As long as the Voters are reluctant to change then we are stuck with what we have.\n\n \n I dont think the voters are reluctant to change a lot of these things. It is the politicians who are afraid of alienating certain groups and losing votes. The democrats need crippled people and old people to vote for them to stay in office. If every other person in the country was in favor of cutting social security and disability, the democrats would still not be willing to do it because they would lose those votes. Traditionally voters get mad about cutting programs they support, not failure to cut programs that they oppose. \n \n That is what makes current trends so interesting. Politicians are actually at risk of losing votes because of failure to cut programs.",

There are too many liability concerns that come with knowingly bringing somebody on board who is popping oxy like it s candy...even if they have a prescription for it. The guy I know in a wheelchair, though, there are hundreds of jobs he could do and do just fine. Prior to his injury he was an industrial equipment troubleshooter. Probably cant do that anymore, but there is still plenty out there he could do just fine. It is the old \"hand up or hand out\" debate.",
