   "To the Guy Who Tried to Mug Me in Downtown Savannah night before last. \n \n \n Date: 07-27-09, 1:43 A M EST. I was the guy wearing the black Burberry jacket that you demanded that I hand over, shortly after you pulled the knife on my girlfriend, threatening our lives and me. You also asked for my girlfriend's purse and earrings. I can only hope that you somehow come across this rather important message.\n \n \n First, I'd like to apologize for your embarrassment when I drew my pistol after you took my Jacket. The evening was not that cold, and I was wearing the jacket for a reason. My girlfriend had just bought me that Kimber Model 1911 .45 A CP pistol for my birthday, and we had picked up a shoulder holster for it that very evening. Obviously you agree that it is a very Intimidating weapon when pointed at your head wasn't it? I know it probably wasn't fun walking back to wherever you'd come from bare footed since I made you leave your shoes, cell phone, and wallet with me. [That prevented you from calling or running to your buddies to come help mug us again]. \n \n \n After I called your mother, or \"Momma\" as you had her listed in your cell, I explained the entire episode of what you'd done. Then I went and filled up my gas tank as well as four other people's in the gas station on your credit card. The guy with the big motor home took 150 gallons and was extremely grateful! I gave your shoes to a homeless guy outside Vinnie Van Go Gos, along with all the cash in your wa llet. [That made his day!] I then threw your wallet into the big pink \"pimp mobile\" that was parked at the curb .. after I broke the windshield and side window and keyed the entire driver's side of the car. \n \n Later, I called a bunch of phone sex numbers from your cell phone. Ma Bell just now shut down the line, although I only used the phone for a little over a day now, so what's going on with that? Earlier, I managed to get in two threatening phone calls to the DA's office and one to the FBI, while mentioning President Obama as my possible target. The FBI guy seemed really intense and we had a nice long chat (I guess while he traced your number etc.). \n \n In a way, perhaps I should apologize for not killing you ... but I feel this type of retribution is a far more appropriate punishment for your threatened crime. I wish you well as you try to sort through some of these rather immediate pressing issues, and can only hope that you have the opportunity to reflect upon, and perhaps reconsider the career path you've chosen to pursue in life. Remember, next time you might not be so lucky. Have a good day! \n \n \n \n \n Thoughtfully yours,\n \n \n Alex \n \n \n \n \n P.S. Remember this motto. . An armed society makes for a more civil society!\n \n \n Yogi Berra once said \"The future ain't what it used to be \"",

   "Reminds me of the time when I was just out of the military and worked in a gas station in a rather not so nice neigborhood for a short time. I carried a 45 auto in a shoulder holster. Some \"gentlemen\" pulled upto the pumps and my partner (also armed) pumped the gas they \"requested.\" \n Well, one of these \"gentlemen\" got out of the car and walked, rather swsaggered, toward me. After calling me a M***er F***er he demanded a cigarette. I smoked then and my pack of smokes was obvious in my shirt pocket. When he was about 5 feet away I said, \"They're right here, BOY, why don't you take one.\" \n Well it suddenly got real quiet for a few seconds. then his gentlemen \"friends\" began to taunt him saying, \"Yeah BOY, you heard the man BOY, take one, Boy.\"\n Now looking quite uncertain and reather nervous he started to take another step toward me. That's when I shoved the old slabsides right up under his nose. I said \"I'll even light it for you, BOY\" \n For some reason he didn't call me a \"M***er F***er any more, but addressed me as, of all things \"...brother.\"\n I informed him that I wasn't even close to being his \"brother\" and suggested he address me as \"SIR!\" He must have thought that was a good idea because he kept saying \"yes sir, yes sir, yes sir' as he slowly and quite nerviously back his way to the car. The driver even got in on the act and addressed my co-worker, who happend at that time to be holdikng a big S&W .22 Jet Mag., as \"Sir\" and even paid for the gas that was pumped. If they would have stuck around we would have offered to check their oil, given them some S&H Green Stamps and a free water glass. However, they seemed in a hurry to go somewhere and left right after paying. \n\n \n I just typed this line here so I'd have ten characters. Quotes don't count as characters for some reason.",
