   "I just joined here and I like to discuss gun control. I am heavily in favor of the second amendment, but I HONESTLY listen and consider both sides. If you want to have some good CIVILIZED agruements, hit me up!\n \n I'll start the ball rolling:\n \n All anti-gunners: alot of you liberals are smart and have the right intentions, but far too often you are misimfromed (honestly) by the media and the movies. Too often your ignorance (in the literal sense, not insultingly) works against you in your cause. You guys REALLY need to get someone who knows what they are talking about to help you. Guys like John Kerry and Sarah Brady TRULY make your cause look bad in the eyes of the informed.\n \n One of my favorite arguements is the assault weapons ban, you guys they tricked you and it is sad. If I was an anti-gunner I would be very angry by the deception they have dealt us. They pull on your honest intended hearts with smoke and mirrors legislation. If I didn't know guns like I do, I would be SEVERELY confused too, so I understand how it can stir emotion in you that anyone would oppose the ban. It is not the pro-gunners that you shold be mad at, it is the very politicians that work for you that play off the typical anti-gunners lack of true, first hand knowledge on guns.\n \n You should get better guys to represent your cause. Your current politicians hurt YOUR very own cause more than they help. If you only new the truth you would be p*ssed at them too.",
