   "In a radio interview this past weekend, Louis Marinelli, the former NOM (National Organization for Marriage) activist who announced that he was leaving the group earlier this month, revealed that he has been receiving threats from NOM leader Brian Brown.\n \n Marinelli had a change of heart on a NOM bus tour last summer when he came face-to-face with real gay couples, even as he was fighting against their rights. But now that he has begun to speak out in favor of gay rights and against NOM, Marinelli says that Brown has been threatening legal action if Marinelli does not remove blog posts revealing details of NOM's dirty tactics. From the man himself:\n  \"I've received a message or two from Brian [Brown], who basically has - he's trying to intimidate me to stop talking. He's saying that if I don't remove the posts I've posted on my site and I don't stop telling the truth about who they are he may pursue legal action. I considered it an intimidation tactic. On two occasions he wrote me a message saying if I don't comply with his wish that I remove certain posts from the site...that he would have no option but to pass it on to his attorneys and pursue legal action.\"\n\n Louis Marinelli: NOM Threatening to Sue if I Don&#8217;t Stop Telling the Truth Ashton Elijah\n \n Welcome to the reality of the anti-gay movement.\n Like in their ad campaigns, truth need not apply... emoticon_emb",
