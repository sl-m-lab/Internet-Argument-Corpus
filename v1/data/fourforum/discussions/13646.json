   "Glenn Beck used his popular Fox News show this afternoon to attack the background of Van Jones, a White House environmental advisor who co-founded an African American political advocacy group that organized an advertising boycott of his program.\n \n During his 2 p.m. PDT show, Beck did not address the boycott spearheaded by Color of Change to protest the talk show host's remark last month that he believes President Obama is \"a racist.\" \n \n Instead, he spent a large share of his program suggesting that Jones, who co-founded Color of Change in 2005, is a radical. Jones now serves as a special advisor for Green Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation at the White House Council on Environmental Quality. \n\n UPDATED: Glenn Beck goes after Color of Change co-founder Van Jones | Show Tracker | Los Angeles Times\n \n The trumped up charge that Van Jones is a \"radical,\" whatever the hades that is.\n \n When the truth is, Jones' organization was successfully persuading advertisers to boycott Beck's show.\n \n Of course, Beck has a right to protect himself and his pocketbook, but he should at least tell the truth about it.\n \n And, even if Beck lost every one of his advertisers, his deep-pocketed boss, Rupert Murdoch, would put out billions to keep Beck on the air.",

He pieces together bits of information that show an overall pattern that is lacking in most other media.

Unquestionably, Obama is paying back the unions in the country for his being elected. Anyone that claims otherwise is blind to the facts.",
