   "Private schools expel students for a variety of reasons including having special needs, behavior, etc. Then they return to public education. When they return these students still have the issues they had at the private schools. The problem is the funding will not be there to meet the needs of that child because after enrollment is locked on the third Friday of September, so is public funding. \n \n Will parents be responsible and pay their $ 4000 dollars back into the public education system after the 5500 is gone? This voucher idea seems to be an attack on the poor. Our public school system, despite the popular attacks we receive, is not leaving children behind. The percentage of students graduating from high school has increased tremendously from the earlier years of education. Our country (USA) provides an education to EVERY child. I'd like to see other nations make an attempt to educate EVERY child and not just the talented ones. When other nations step up and do that, we can then compare test results accross the board. Until then, comparisons by averages are unfair and not comparable.\n \n Finally, what happens when the 5,500 (or whatever sum of money) doesn't cover an entire year of private schooling? Will the child then be forced to come back to a \"failing\" public school that is lacking funding and possibly teachers because of this lack of funding? Will the child not be accepted back into the school because of overcrowding? \n \n I'm a product of public education. My parents came into this country illegally and we lived in a garage for the first few years of my life. Dad went to adult school and graduated from high school in this country. He is now a naturalized citizen of the US. I don't think he would have had that opportunity anywhere else in the world. He became a VP at a big company through hard work and working his way up. Later on he opened his own business in LA. Both my brother and I have graduated from college. I'm a middle school teacher and he is a network administrator. I can't imagine where I would have ended up if I hadn't had the opportunities allowed to me by our awesome (with many problems but regardless AWESOME) country and our free school system.\n \n \n We really need to re-think what the benefits of having public education are to us as a community. Will it benefit us to have a bunch of broke XXX uneducated people running around?? I know companies definitely benefit from that (lets face it, it is much easier to manipulate an uneducated man emotionally into thinking that if he doesn't wear a certain cologne, he won't get laid) than it is to manipulate a well educated person.
