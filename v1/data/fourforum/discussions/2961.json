   "1)Saddam knowingly harbored terrorists\n 2)Saddam offered Bin Laden a safe haven in Iraq\n 3)Saddam used chemical weapons on his own people\n 4)Saddam tortured and killed hundreds of thousands of his own people (see below) because of their religious beliefs, thoughts, expressions, etc.\n 5)Athletes were tortured under Saddam for not performing well\n 6)Saddam violated 16 UN resolutions regarding inspection of his weapons\n 7)Saddam threatened Iraqi weapons scientists and even killed those who leaked information or tried to help the USA/UN\n 8)Saddam was searching to buy more WMDs (see below)\n 9)We have found several shells containing nerve agents that Saddam had hid in the desert, along with many war planes\n 10)Saddam paid the families of Palestinian terrorists $25,000 for their actions in suicide attacks\n 11)Committed gross human rights violations and crimes against humanity\n 12)Supported international terrorism\n 13)Refused to release or account for prisoners of war and other missing individuals from the Gulf War era\n 14)Refused to return stolen Kuwaiti property after Gul War\n 15)Worked to circumvent the UN's economic sanctions\n \n \n \n Here are some examples of Saddam murdering and torturing innocent people:\n \n 1)The killing of Sunni religious leaders such as Abdul Aziz Al Badri the Imam of Dragh district mosque in Baghdad in 1969, Al Shaikh Nadhum Al Asi from Ubaid tribe in Northern Iraq, Al Shiakh Al Shahrazori, Al Shaikh Umar Shaqlawa, Al Shiakh Rami Al Kirkukly, Al Shiakh Mohamad Shafeeq Al Badri, Abdul Ghani Shindala. \n 2)The arrest of thousand of religious people who rose up against the regime and the killing of hundreds of them in the popular uprising of 1977 in which Ayatollah Mohamad Baqir Al Hakim the leader of SCIRI was sentenced to life imprisonment. \n 3)The arrest, torture and execution of Ayatollah Mohamad baqir Al Sadr and his sistre Amina Al Sadr (Bint Al Huda) in 1980. (Yes, that is Moqtada Al-Sadr's father)\n 4)The arrest of 90 members of Al Hakim family and the execution of 16 members of that family in 1983 to put pressure on Ayatollah Mohamad Baqir Al Hakim to stop his struggle against Saddam's regime. \n 5)The assassination of many opposition figures outside Iraq such Haj Sahal Al Salman in UAE in 1981, Sami Mahdi and Ni'ma Mohamad in Pakistan in 1987, Sayed Mahdi Al Hakim in Sudan in 1988, and Shaikh Talib Al Suhail in Lebanon in 1994. \n 6)The execution of 21 Bath Party leaders in 1979 in Iraq , the assassination of Hardan Al Tikriti former defence Minister in Kuwait in 1973, and the former Prime- Minister Abdul Razzaq Al naef in London 1978. \n \n \n (http://www.sciri.btinternet.co.uk/English/Saddam_Crimes/saddam_crimes.html)\n \n \n These are just some of the brutal things Saddam has done. And once you do that, you don't just decide one day to stop. Saddam continued, well into the later 1990s, to torture and kill those who opposed him.\n \n \n This shows exactly how Saddam was searching for more WMDs...\n \n \n Biological\n 1)In 2001, an Iraqi defector, Adnan Ihsan Saeed al-Haideri, said he had visited twenty secret facilities for chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. Mr. Saeed, a civil engineer, supported his claims with stacks of Iraqi government contracts, complete with technical specifications. Mr. Saeed said Iraq used companies to purchase equipment with the blessing of the United Nations - and then secretly used the equipment for their weapons programs.\n 2)Iraq admitted to producing biological agents, and after the 1995 defection of a senior Iraqi official, Iraq admitted to the weaponization of thousands of liters of anthrax, botulinim toxin, and aflatoxin for use with Scud warheads, aerial bombs and aircraft.\n 3)UNSCOM reported to the UN Security Council in April 1995 that Iraq had concealed its biological weapons program and had failed to account for 3 tons of growth material for biological agents.\n 4)The al-Dawrah Foot and Mouth Disease Vaccine Facility is one of two known biocontainment levelthree facilities in Iraq that have an extensive air handling and filtering system. Iraq has admitted that this was a biological weapons facility. In 2001, Iraq announced that it would begin renovating the plant without UN approval, ostensibly to produce vaccines that it could more easily and more quickly import through the UN.\n \n \n Chemical\n 1)Iraq has not accounted for hundreds of tons of chemical precursors and tens of thousands of unfilled munitions, including Scud variant missile warheads.\n 2)Iraq has not accounted for at least 15,000 artillery rockets that in the past were its preferred vehicle for delivering nerve agents, nor has it accounted for about 550 artillery shells filled with mustard agent. (We have already found a few...where are the others?)\n 3)At Fallujah and three other plants, Iraq now has chlorine production capacity far higher than any civilian need for water treatment, and the evidence indicates that some of its chlorine imports are being diverted for military purposes.\n \n \n Nuclear\n 1)A new report released on September 9, 2002 from the International Institute for Strategic Studies - an independent research organization - concludes that Saddam Hussein could build a nuclear bomb within months if he were able to obtain fissile material.\n 2)Iraq has withheld documentation relevant to its past nuclear program, including data about enrichment techniques, foreign procurement, weapons design, experimental data, and technical documents.\n \n \n \n Refusal to allow UN humanitarian aid\n 1)Saddam Hussein has repeatedly refused visits by human rights monitors and the establishment of independent human rights organizations. From 1992 until 2002, Saddam prevented the UN Special Rapporteur from visiting Iraq.\n 2)In September 2001 the Government expelled six UN humanitarian relief workers without providing any explanation.\n \n \n Mistreatment of women\n 1)Former Mukhabarat member Khalid Al-Janabi reported that a Mukhabarat unit, the Technical Operations Directorate, used rape and sexual assault in a systematic and institutionalized manner for political purposes. The unit reportedly also videotaped the rape of female relatives of suspected oppositionists and used the videotapes for blackmail purposes and to ensure their future cooperation.\n 2)In May, the Iraqi Government reportedly tortured to death the mother of three Iraqi defectors for her children's opposition activities.\n 3)Iraqi security agents reportedly decapitated numerous women and men in front of their family members. According to Amnesty International, the victims' heads were displayed in front of their homes for several days.\n \n \n Torture\n 1)Iraqi security services routinely and systematically torture detainees. According to former prisoners, torture techniques included branding, electric shocks administered to the genitals and other areas, beating, pulling out of fingernails, burning with hot irons and blowtorches, suspension from rotating ceiling fans, dripping acid on the skin, rape, breaking of limbs, denial of food and water, extended solitary confinement in dark and extremely small compartments, and threats to rape or otherwise harm family members and relatives. Evidence of such torture often was apparent when security forces\n returned the mutilated bodies of torture victims to their families. (Is this Saddam or Hitler?)\n 2)In 2000, the authorities reportedly introduced tongue amputation as a punishment for persons who criticize Saddam Hussein or his family, and on July 17, government authorities reportedly amputated the tongue of a person who allegedly criticized Saddam Hussein. Authorities reportedly performed the amputation in front of a large crowd. Similar tongue amputations also reportedly occurred.\n 3)Saad Keis Naoman, an Iraqi soccer player who defected to Europe, reported that he and his teammates were beaten and humiliated at the order of Uday Saddam Hussein for poor performances. He was flogged until his back was bloody, forcing him to sleep on his stomach in the tiny cell in Al-Radwaniya prison.\n \n \n Political Oppression\n 1)Former UN Human Rights Special Rapporteur Max Van der Stoel's report in April 1998 stated that Iraq had executed at least 1,500 people during the previous year for political reasons.\n 2)In June 2001, security forces killed a Shi'a cleric, Hussein Bahar al-Uloom, for refusing to appear on television to congratulate Qusay Saddam Hussein for his election to a Ba'th Party position. Such killings continue an apparent government policy of eliminating prominent Shi'a clerics who are suspected of disloyalty to the government. In 1998 and 1999, the Government killed a number of leading Shi'a clerics, prompting the former Special Rapporteur in 1999 to express his concern to the government that the killings might be part of a systematic attack by government officials on the independent leadership of the Shi'a Muslim community. The government did not respond to the Special Rapporteur's letter.\n 3)Iraq has conducted a systematic \"Arabization\" campaign of ethnic cleansing designed to harass and expel ethnic Kurds and Turkmen from government-controlled areas. Non-Arab citizens are forced to change their ethnicity or their identity documents and adopt Arab names, or they are deprived of their homes, property and food-ration cards, and expelled.\n \n \n Torture of Children\n 1)Saddam Hussein has held 3-week training courses in weapons use, hand-to-hand fighting, rappelling from helicopters, and infantry tactics for children between 10 and 15 years of age. Camps for these \"Saddam Cubs\" operated throughout the country. Senior military officers who supervised the courses noted that the children held up under the \"physical and psychological strain\" of training that lasted for as long as 14 hours each day. Sources in the opposition report that the army found it difficult to recruit enough children to fill all of the vacancies in the program. Families reportedly were threatened with the loss of their food ration cards if they refused to enroll their children in the course. The Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq reported in October 1999 that authorities were denying food ration cards to families that failed to send their young sons to Saddam Cubs compulsory weapons-training camps. Similarly, authorities reportedly withheld school examination results to students unless they registered in the Fedayeen Saddam organization.\n 2)Child labor persists and there are instances of forced labor.\n \n \n Basic Freedoms that Iraqis Didn't Have\n 1)In practice, Saddam Hussein does not permit freedom of speech or of the press, and does not tolerate political dissent in areas under its control. In November 2000, the UN General Assembly criticized Saddam Hussein's \"suppression of freedom of thought, expression, information, association, and assembly.\" The Special Rapporteur stated in October 1999 that citizens lived \"in a climate of fear,\" in which whatever they said or did, particularly in the area of politics, involved \"the risk of arrest and\n interrogation by the police or military intelligence.\" He noted that \"the mere suggestion that someone is not a supporter of the President carries the prospect of the death penalty.\"\n 2)The Iraqi Government, the Ba'th Party, or persons close to Saddam Hussein own all print and broadcast media, and operate them as propaganda outlets. They generally do not report opposing points of view that are expressed either domestically or abroad.\n 3)In 1999, Uday Hussein reportedly dismissed hundreds of members of the Iraqi Union of Journalists for not praising Saddam Hussein and the Government sufficiently.\n \n \n Saddam Supporting Terrorism\n 1)In 1993, the Iraqi Intelligence Service (IIS) directed and pursued an attempt to assassinate, through the\n use of a powerful car bomb, former U.S. President George Bush and the Emir of Kuwait. Kuwaiti\n authorities thwarted the terrorist plot and arrested 16 suspects, led by two Iraqi nationals.\n 2)Iraq shelters terrorist groups including the Mujahedin-e-Khalq Organization (MKO), which has used terrorist violence against Iran and in the 1970s was responsible for killing several U.S. military personnel and U.S. civilians.\n 3)Iraq shelters several prominent Palestinian terrorist organizations in Baghdad, including the Palestine Liberation Front (PLF), which is known for aerial attacks against Israel and is headed by Abu Abbas, who carried out the 1985 hijacking of the cruise ship Achille Lauro and murdered U.S. citizen Leon Klinghoffer.\n 4)Iraq shelters the Abu Nidal Organization, an international terrorist organization that has carried out terrorist attacks in twenty countries, killing or injuring almost 900 people. Targets have included the United States and several other Western nations. Each of these groups have offices in Baghdad and receive training, logistical assistance, and financial aid from the government of Iraq.\n 5)In April 2002, Saddam Hussein increased from $10,000 to $25,000 the money offered to families of Palestinian suicide/homicide bombers. The rules for rewarding suicide/homicide bombers are strict and insist that only someone who blows himself up with a belt of explosives gets the full payment. Payments are made on a strict scale, with different amounts for wounds, disablement, death as a \"martyr\" and $25,000 for a suicide bomber. Mahmoud Besharat, a representative on the West Bank who is handing out to families the money from Saddam, said, \"You would have to ask President Saddam why he is being so generous. But he is a revolutionary and he wants this distinguished struggle, the intifada, to continue.\"\n 6)Former Iraqi military officers have described a highly secret terrorist training facility in Iraq known as Salman Pak, where both Iraqis and non-Iraqi Arabs receive training on hijacking planes and trains, planting explosives in cities, sabotage, and assassinations.\n \n \n \n Saddam and the Oil-For-Food Program\n 1)Saddam Hussein has illegally imported hundreds of millions of dollars in goods in violation of economic sanctions and outside of the UN's Oil-for-Food program. For example, Iraq has imported fiber optic communications systems that support the Iraqi military.\n 2)The Iraqi regime illicitly exports hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil each day in flagrant violation of UNSCRs and blatant disregard for the humanitarian well-being of the Iraqi people. In so doing, it has deprived the Iraqi people of billions of dollars in food, medicine, and other humanitarian assistance that would have been provided if the regime had exported the oil under the UN Oil-for-Food program. Instead, Saddam Hussein has used these billions to fund his WMD programs, pay off his security apparatus, and supply himself and his supporters with luxury items and other goods.\n 3)Saddam Hussein spends smuggled oil wealth on his lavish palaces and inner circle, rather than on the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people.\n \n \n \n (http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/09/iraqdecade.pdf)\n \n \n \n How can you honestly look at all of these things and say that Saddam didn't pose a threat to us, the Middle East, and most importantly his own citizens? Look at how much better Iraq is now. They have much more schools, they are allowed to have satellite TV, there are hundreds of newspapers that can speak their minds, and people don't have to live in fear about everything they do.",

   "replace \"saddam\" with \"iran\", \"sudan\", \"egypt\", \"libya\", \"jordan\", \"pakistan\", \"saudi arabia\", or any of the dozen or so other known terrorist states. \n\n \n \n You are completely wrong. A few of these may be true for the some of these countries, but not one of these countries, nor any country for that matter, fit all of them (except Saddam and Iraq).\n \n \n \nwhere are these thousands of liters of biological weapons and warheads? having biological weapons capability and having biological weapons are different things. \n \n \n Ask Saddam. They were there, we have evidence of it. Now they're not. So Saddam either hid them or gave them to someone else to use.\n \n \n \nagain, by not accounting for chemical weapons that dont exist, does that make you a threat? \n\n \n Along with not allowing people to check for them, yes it does. If he didn't have any weapons/chemicals, why would he threaten his scientists and not allow them to talk to UN inspectors? \n \n \n \nwow! and if we had some logs we could make a rope bridge... if we had some rope... \n\n \n \n True. But it isn't illegal for us to possess logs like it was for Saddam to have nerve gas. He had nerve gas and over 20,000 SCUD missiles with which to launch them. And they violated UN regulations for how far they could be launched. So he had illegal weapons to deliver the chemicals, and had the illegal chemicals. And he refused to let weapons inspectors look for weapons without going with his personal aids, who wouldn't let them go where they wanted to. Very suspicious.\n \n \n \nthe true actions of an international threat \n\n \n \n And your point?\n \n \n \nhow do we overlook the al-qaeda camps in pakistan, sudan, jordan and even saudi arabia and use our resources in search of the legendary salman park? how do we brush aside bin laden himself, who not only trained more terrorists than whatever you are talking about, he actually executed the hijacking, bombing and murder of americans here and abroad. for all the threats we say saddam made, he has a hard time executing them, but somehow he is a more urgent threat than bin laden \n\n \n \n We don't. Do you ever look at the news? Pakistan arrests terrorists every day. So does Saudi Arabia and Jordan. Sudan is another story. So you decided to turn this thread from why we were justified to go into Iraq into what went wrong with finding Bin Laden? Stick to the topic. \n \n \n \nmy problem is not that iraq was not a threat, but simply that iraq was the least serious threat in the middle east, yet it is the only threat we have attempted to meutralize. the other countries which have actual weapons and terrorists are being ignored, while the one nation that only have \"weapons capabilities\" and rumored terrorist camps is the one we put our entire military effort into. \n \n how can that be justified?\n\n \n \n How was it the least threat? No other country in the Middle East wouldn't let UN inspectors in, killed civilians by the thousands, terrorized innocent civilians, tortured athletes, women, and people who had different opinions than Saddam, paid families of suicide bombers money for their efforts, tested chemical and biological weapons on their own people as well as others, refused freedom of anything, raped and decapitated women on camera and showed it to their family and left the heads hanging outside their house, or tried to assassinate one of our Presidents. Iraq is not the only country in which we are working to root out terrorism. England, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Israel, UAE, Bahrain, etc. All of them are cooperating with us and helping us to defeat terrorism. Answer my question...how can you seriously think, after reading all of the evidence I provided, that we were not justified to remove Saddam, who committed all of the above atrocities?",

   "I don't think we've simply overlooked al Qaeda camps. There are numerous accounts of failed and aborted attempts to kill Bin Laden in the 9-11 Report. Some of these were under Clinton. There is still action in that regard. We just don't hear much about it.\n\n yes, but how does talking about what clinton did or didnt do address our current lack of action to find the real terrorists? i read chapter 4 of the report, and i'm aware of the failed attempts. bush has not even attempted to capture or kill bin laden, but has invested everything he possibly can in thwarting saddam. and while saddam had no known plans to attack america, bin laden has been preaching his anti-american declaration of war for over a decade. so, again, how can we justify the war in iraq and ignore the other states that are harboring al qaeda and possibly bin laden? (and try to answer the question this time)\n \n \nThe Taliban is gone. (Afghanistan)\n\n the taliban is not bin laden or al qaeda. bin laden is fully capable of acting with or without the taliban. citing the tablian's defeat as a major stride is still pointless when al qaeda and bin laden himself is still out there with the same intentions that he always had.",

   "none of these are threats to america, bush. look carefully at the list of attrocities you are charging saddam with, and tell me which one is threating america\n\n \n \n Neither is what is going on in Sudan, but many Democrats have a problem with that. Neither does the violence in Israel and Palestinian territory. So we should just ignore what any other ruler does as long as it doesn't effect us? And for the record, many of them did effect us. I will show you some below. Saddam's chemical and biological weapons were a definite threat to us and the Middle East.\n \n \n \n Saddam's Action That Had a Direct Effect on the US\n 1)The Department of Defense reported in January 2001 that Iraq has continued to work on its weapons programs, including converting L-29 jet trainer aircraft for potential vehicles for the delivery of chemical or biological weapons.\n 2)A new report released on September 9, 2002 from the International Institute for Strategic Studies - an independent research organization - concludes that Saddam Hussein could build a nuclear bomb within months if he were able to obtain fissile material.\n 3)In 1993, the Iraqi Intelligence Service (IIS) directed and pursued an attempt to assassinate, through the use of a powerful car bomb, former U.S. President George Bush and the Emir of Kuwait. Kuwaiti authorities thwarted the terrorist plot and arrested 16 suspects, led by two Iraqi nationals.\n 4)Iraq shelters terrorist groups including the Mujahedin-e-Khalq Organization (MKO), which has used terrorist violence against Iran and in the 1970s was responsible for killing several U.S. military personnel and U.S. civilians.\n 5)Iraq shelters several prominent Palestinian terrorist organizations in Baghdad, including the Palestine Liberation Front (PLF), which is known for aerial attacks against Israel and is headed by Abu Abbas, who carried out the 1985 hijacking of the cruise ship Achille Lauro and murdered U.S. citizen Leon Klinghoffer.\n 6)Former Iraqi military officers have described a highly secret terrorist training facility in Iraq known as Salman Pak, where both Iraqis and non-Iraqi Arabs receive training on hijacking planes and trains, planting explosives in cities, sabotage, and assassinations.\n 7)Saddam Hussein has failed to return, or account for, a large number of Kuwaiti and US citizens and citizens of other countries who were detained during the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait and continues to refuse to cooperate with the Tripartite Commission to resolve the cases.\n 8)Of 609 cases of missing Gulf War POWs/MIAs representing 14 nationalities - including one American pilot - under review by the Tripartite Commission on Gulf War Missing, only 4 have been resolved. Because of continued Iraqi obfuscation and concealment, very few cases have been resolved since the Gulf War. Saddam Hussein denies having any knowledge of the others and claims that any relevant records were lost in the aftermath of the Gulf War.\n \n \n (http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/09/iraqdecade.pdf)\n \n \n Do you not agree that those directly effect the US and pose a threat to us?\n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhen youre done with that, take a look at bin laden and his ACTIONS. take a look at the nuclear WEAPONS in pakistan, iran, saudi arabia, egypt, syria, lebanon, UAE, etc. your focus on the THREATS and CAPABILITIES of iraq pales in the light of actual reality\n\n \n \n I did. Tell me where Bin Laden kills his own people, tests chemicals on them, rapes and kills women in front of their family, and puts people through examinations where their genitals are tied to electrodes. Neither Pakistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, UAE, etc....none of them fit that description. None of those countries, except Pakistan, are known to have nuclear weapons. It is absolutely amazing that you don't think that the 21 pages of evidence against Saddam are worthy, and that it pales in the light of actual reality. The only thing it pales in the light of is Hitler, who did even worse things to many more people.",

Even president Bush has pretty much given up on finding stockpiles. He says (and I agree) that it was worth it anyway, because we got rid of an evil tyrant who was killing his own people. That's true, but it has nothing to do with Iraq being a threat to the US.\n\n \n \n \n Yes it does. Iraq has not accounted for hundreds of tons of chemical precursors and tens of thousands of unfilled munitions, including Scud variant missile warheads. Iraq has not accounted for at least 15,000 artillery rockets that in the past were its preferred vehicle for delivering nerve agents, nor has it accounted for about 550 artillery shells filled with mustard agent. They didn't just disappear. They're either in Iraq, or in the hands of someone else. Weapons don't just disappear in 10 years.\n \n \n \n \nThe terrorism issue is important, but the point is its anti-israeli terror, not directed at the US (for example, in the Achille Lauro hijacking, Mr. Klinghoffer had dual Israeli/US citizenship). This isn't to say that we should turn a blind eye to anti-Israeli terror (in fact, I think we need to take a stronger stance against it).

If you don't know Israel is one of our biggest allies. Don't you think they expect us to help them out when they get attacked? The same as if someone attacked us, we would expect our allies to help.\n \n \n \n \nThe rest of your points are all about various human rights violations. These form the crux of my reasons for supporting the Iraqi war. But they don't represent a threat to the US either. For much the same reasons, the US needs to lead/fund/or otherwise organize interventionary action in the Congo and Sudan.\n\n \n \n \n That's right, we do need to help them out.

(Yes, that is Moqtada Al-Sadr's father)\n 4)The arrest of 90 members of Al Hakim family and the execution of 16 members of that family in 1983 to put pressure on Ayatollah Mohamad Baqir Al Hakim to stop his struggle against Saddam's regime. \n 5)The assassination of many opposition figures outside Iraq such Haj Sahal Al Salman in UAE in 1981, Sami Mahdi and Ni'ma Mohamad in Pakistan in 1987, Sayed Mahdi Al Hakim in Sudan in 1988, and Shaikh Talib Al Suhail in Lebanon in 1994. \n 6)The execution of 21 Bath Party leaders in 1979 in Iraq , the assassination of Hardan Al Tikriti former defence Minister in Kuwait in 1973, and the former Prime- Minister Abdul Razzaq Al naef in London 1978. \n \n \n (http://www.sciri.btinternet.co.uk/English/Saddam_Crimes/saddam_crimes.html)\n \n \n These are just some of the brutal things Saddam has done. And once you do that, you don't just decide one day to stop. Saddam continued, well into the later 1990s, to torture and kill those who opposed him.\n \n \n This shows exactly how Saddam was searching for more WMDs...\n \n \n Biological\n 1)In 2001, an Iraqi defector, Adnan Ihsan Saeed al-Haideri, said he had visited twenty secret facilities for chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. Mr. Saeed, a civil engineer, supported his claims with stacks of Iraqi government contracts, complete with technical specifications. Mr. Saeed said Iraq used companies to purchase equipment with the blessing of the United Nations - and then secretly used the equipment for their weapons programs.\n 2)Iraq admitted to producing biological agents, and after the 1995 defection of a senior Iraqi official, Iraq admitted to the weaponization of thousands of liters of anthrax, botulinim toxin, and aflatoxin for use with Scud warheads, aerial bombs and aircraft.\n 3)UNSCOM reported to the UN Security Council in April 1995 that Iraq had concealed its biological weapons program and had failed to account for 3 tons of growth material for biological agents.\n 4)The al-Dawrah Foot and Mouth Disease Vaccine Facility is one of two known biocontainment levelthree facilities in Iraq that have an extensive air handling and filtering system. Iraq has admitted that this was a biological weapons facility. In 2001, Iraq announced that it would begin renovating the plant without UN approval, ostensibly to produce vaccines that it could more easily and more quickly import through the UN.\n \n \n Chemical\n 1)Iraq has not accounted for hundreds of tons of chemical precursors and tens of thousands of unfilled munitions, including Scud variant missile warheads.\n 2)Iraq has not accounted for at least 15,000 artillery rockets that in the past were its preferred vehicle for delivering nerve agents, nor has it accounted for about 550 artillery shells filled with mustard agent. (We have already found a few...where are the others?)\n 3)At Fallujah and three other plants, Iraq now has chlorine production capacity far higher than any civilian need for water treatment, and the evidence indicates that some of its chlorine imports are being diverted for military purposes.\n \n \n Nuclear\n 1)A new report released on September 9, 2002 from the International Institute for Strategic Studies - an independent research organization - concludes that Saddam Hussein could build a nuclear bomb within months if he were able to obtain fissile material.\n 2)Iraq has withheld documentation relevant to its past nuclear program, including data about enrichment techniques, foreign procurement, weapons design, experimental data, and technical documents.\n \n \n \n Refusal to allow UN humanitarian aid\n 1)Saddam Hussein has repeatedly refused visits by human rights monitors and the establishment of independent human rights organizations. From 1992 until 2002, Saddam prevented the UN Special Rapporteur from visiting Iraq.\n 2)In September 2001 the Government expelled six UN humanitarian relief workers without providing any explanation.\n \n \n Mistreatment of women\n 1)Former Mukhabarat member Khalid Al-Janabi reported that a Mukhabarat unit, the Technical Operations Directorate, used rape and sexual assault in a systematic and institutionalized manner for political purposes. The unit reportedly also videotaped the rape of female relatives of suspected oppositionists and used the videotapes for blackmail purposes and to ensure their future cooperation.\n 2)In May, the Iraqi Government reportedly tortured to death the mother of three Iraqi defectors for her children's opposition activities.\n 3)Iraqi security agents reportedly decapitated numerous women and men in front of their family members. According to Amnesty International, the victims' heads were displayed in front of their homes for several days.\n \n \n Torture\n 1)Iraqi security services routinely and systematically torture detainees. According to former prisoners, torture techniques included branding, electric shocks administered to the genitals and other areas, beating, pulling out of fingernails, burning with hot irons and blowtorches, suspension from rotating ceiling fans, dripping acid on the skin, rape, breaking of limbs, denial of food and water, extended solitary confinement in dark and extremely small compartments, and threats to rape or otherwise harm family members and relatives. Evidence of such torture often was apparent when security forces\n returned the mutilated bodies of torture victims to their families. (Is this Saddam or Hitler?)\n 2)In 2000, the authorities reportedly introduced tongue amputation as a punishment for persons who criticize Saddam Hussein or his family, and on July 17, government authorities reportedly amputated the tongue of a person who allegedly criticized Saddam Hussein. Authorities reportedly performed the amputation in front of a large crowd. Similar tongue amputations also reportedly occurred.\n 3)Saad Keis Naoman, an Iraqi soccer player who defected to Europe, reported that he and his teammates were beaten and humiliated at the order of Uday Saddam Hussein for poor performances. He was flogged until his back was bloody, forcing him to sleep on his stomach in the tiny cell in Al-Radwaniya prison.\n \n \n Political Oppression\n 1)Former UN Human Rights Special Rapporteur Max Van der Stoel's report in April 1998 stated that Iraq had executed at least 1,500 people during the previous year for political reasons.\n 2)In June 2001, security forces killed a Shi'a cleric, Hussein Bahar al-Uloom, for refusing to appear on television to congratulate Qusay Saddam Hussein for his election to a Ba'th Party position. Such killings continue an apparent government policy of eliminating prominent Shi'a clerics who are suspected of disloyalty to the government. In 1998 and 1999, the Government killed a number of leading Shi'a clerics, prompting the former Special Rapporteur in 1999 to express his concern to the government that the killings might be part of a systematic attack by government officials on the independent leadership of the Shi'a Muslim community. The government did not respond to the Special Rapporteur's letter.\n 3)Iraq has conducted a systematic \"Arabization\" campaign of ethnic cleansing designed to harass and expel ethnic Kurds and Turkmen from government-controlled areas. Non-Arab citizens are forced to change their ethnicity or their identity documents and adopt Arab names, or they are deprived of their homes, property and food-ration cards, and expelled.\n \n \n Torture of Children\n 1)Saddam Hussein has held 3-week training courses in weapons use, hand-to-hand fighting, rappelling from helicopters, and infantry tactics for children between 10 and 15 years of age. Camps for these \"Saddam Cubs\" operated throughout the country. Senior military officers who supervised the courses noted that the children held up under the \"physical and psychological strain\" of training that lasted for as long as 14 hours each day. Sources in the opposition report that the army found it difficult to recruit enough children to fill all of the vacancies in the program. Families reportedly were threatened with the loss of their food ration cards if they refused to enroll their children in the course. The Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq reported in October 1999 that authorities were denying food ration cards to families that failed to send their young sons to Saddam Cubs compulsory weapons-training camps. Similarly, authorities reportedly withheld school examination results to students unless they registered in the Fedayeen Saddam organization.\n 2)Child labor persists and there are instances of forced labor.\n \n \n Basic Freedoms that Iraqis Didn't Have\n 1)In practice, Saddam Hussein does not permit freedom of speech or of the press, and does not tolerate political dissent in areas under its control. In November 2000, the UN General Assembly criticized Saddam Hussein's \"suppression of freedom of thought, expression, information, association, and assembly.\" The Special Rapporteur stated in October 1999 that citizens lived \"in a climate of fear,\" in which whatever they said or did, particularly in the area of politics, involved \"the risk of arrest and\n interrogation by the police or military intelligence.\" He noted that \"the mere suggestion that someone is not a supporter of the President carries the prospect of the death penalty.\"\n 2)The Iraqi Government, the Ba'th Party, or persons close to Saddam Hussein own all print and broadcast media, and operate them as propaganda outlets. They generally do not report opposing points of view that are expressed either domestically or abroad.\n 3)In 1999, Uday Hussein reportedly dismissed hundreds of members of the Iraqi Union of Journalists for not praising Saddam Hussein and the Government sufficiently.\n \n \n Saddam Supporting Terrorism\n 1)In 1993, the Iraqi Intelligence Service (IIS) directed and pursued an attempt to assassinate, through the\n use of a powerful car bomb, former U.S. President George Bush and the Emir of Kuwait. Kuwaiti\n authorities thwarted the terrorist plot and arrested 16 suspects, led by two Iraqi nationals.\n 2)Iraq shelters terrorist groups including the Mujahedin-e-Khalq Organization (MKO), which has used terrorist violence against Iran and in the 1970s was responsible for killing several U.S. military personnel and U.S. civilians.\n 3)Iraq shelters several prominent Palestinian terrorist organizations in Baghdad, including the Palestine Liberation Front (PLF), which is known for aerial attacks against Israel and is headed by Abu Abbas, who carried out the 1985 hijacking of the cruise ship Achille Lauro and murdered U.S. citizen Leon Klinghoffer.\n 4)Iraq shelters the Abu Nidal Organization, an international terrorist organization that has carried out terrorist attacks in twenty countries, killing or injuring almost 900 people. Targets have included the United States and several other Western nations. Each of these groups have offices in Baghdad and receive training, logistical assistance, and financial aid from the government of Iraq.\n 5)In April 2002, Saddam Hussein increased from $10,000 to $25,000 the money offered to families of Palestinian suicide/homicide bombers. The rules for rewarding suicide/homicide bombers are strict and insist that only someone who blows himself up with a belt of explosives gets the full payment. Payments are made on a strict scale, with different amounts for wounds, disablement, death as a \"martyr\" and $25,000 for a suicide bomber. Mahmoud Besharat, a representative on the West Bank who is handing out to families the money from Saddam, said, \"You would have to ask President Saddam why he is being so generous. But he is a revolutionary and he wants this distinguished struggle, the intifada, to continue.\"\n 6)Former Iraqi military officers have described a highly secret terrorist training facility in Iraq known as Salman Pak, where both Iraqis and non-Iraqi Arabs receive training on hijacking planes and trains, planting explosives in cities, sabotage, and assassinations.\n \n \n \n Saddam and the Oil-For-Food Program\n 1)Saddam Hussein has illegally imported hundreds of millions of dollars in goods in violation of economic sanctions and outside of the UN's Oil-for-Food program. For example, Iraq has imported fiber optic communications systems that support the Iraqi military.\n 2)The Iraqi regime illicitly exports hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil each day in flagrant violation of UNSCRs and blatant disregard for the humanitarian well-being of the Iraqi people. In so doing, it has deprived the Iraqi people of billions of dollars in food, medicine, and other humanitarian assistance that would have been provided if the regime had exported the oil under the UN Oil-for-Food program. Instead, Saddam Hussein has used these billions to fund his WMD programs, pay off his security apparatus, and supply himself and his supporters with luxury items and other goods.\n 3)Saddam Hussein spends smuggled oil wealth on his lavish palaces and inner circle, rather than on the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people.\n \n \n \n (http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/09/iraqdecade.pdf)\n \n \n \n How can you honestly look at all of these things and say that Saddam didn't pose a threat to us, the Middle East, and most importantly his own citizens? Look at how much better Iraq is now. They have much more schools, they are allowed to have satellite TV, there are hundreds of newspapers that can speak their minds, and people don't have to live in fear about everything they do.\n\n \n I don't understand the point of this thread. We already did invade Iraq and we already spent the billions of dollars to do so. In addition, we have, and will have thousands of US troops there for many years to come. We have all seen the \"post war\" information on Iraq and its threat for the last 16 months. Are you trying to convince yourself that we've done the right thing? I've got news for you, we're all along for a very long and expensive ride. There hasn't been a shred of new data introduced by anyone since the invasion and subsequent failed search for the WMD's. Apparently, no one else is buying it either since the election is 3 months away and it's still a dead heat. I know, I know, everyone in disagreement is a Liberal.",

   " Haha!! It is funny how you and all the other Liberals like you cannot refute anything. You bring up some BS thing like \"I am selectively quoting\". Here is the link. Look it over. Everything I cited is word for word. There is absolutely no conflicting opinion or story. And it is whitehouse.gov, so don't even try to respond with another weak comment like you did here.\n \n (http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/rele.../iraqdecade.pdf)\n \n I think you are just trying to get away from all the facts I stated. Nice try though \n\n \n And you're just dodging the fact that you were CAUGHT making intellectually dishonest statements that violate every norm of ethical argumentation. That's nothing something you can brush off lightly, as much as you're trying to. For someone who is ready to jump down Kerry's throat for an inaccurate statement concerning events 30 years ago, I'd expect a more professional manner.\n \n Technically, this ethical lapse on your part should mean that you face whatever sanctions you believed should have been put on Kerry (which I'd imagine are moral condemnation and disqualification (not legally) from running for office). N. Stephen Kinsella explains in his article New Rationalist Directions in Libertarian Rights Theory\n \n [A]ny truth at all (including norms such as individual rights to life, liberty and property) that one would wish to discuss, deny, or affirm, will be brought up in the course of an argumentation, that is to say, will be brought up in dialogue. If participants in argumentation necessarily accept particular truths, including norms, in order to engage in argumentation, they could never challenge these norms in an argument without thereby engaging in a performative contradiction. This would establish these norms as literally incontestable truths.\n ...\n If A makes a statement of fact that B relies on in some substantial way, A will not be permitted to deny it (that is, A will be estopped), if the effect of A's denial would be to injure the party who relies on it. Thus, under the traditional legal principle of estoppel, a person may be prevented, or estopped, from maintaining something (for example in court) inconsistent with his previous conduct or statements. \n\n Your statement of condemnation for Kerry for a distortion of his record/history means you are estopped from protesting similar condemnation for distortions that you have made.\n \n Quoting word-for-word isn't the be-all end-all of ethical argumentation(you quoted word-for-word from the 9/11 report too, you just deliberately ignored the context). The question is whether you're a) getting the information from non-biased sources (for the most part, you didn't) b)accurately quoting the context the claims cited were made in (in the past you haven't, and I caught you) and c) making good faith efforts to respond to the arguments of others, rather than concocted strawmen and dodges (you don't).\n \n For example, you dodge the main part of my North Korea argument. The key part of the argument was that by any objective measure, NK was MORE of a threat than Iraq was to the US because it possessed ICBM technology and could actually HIT us with their missiles. That crosses a HUGE threshold in terms of danger posed to the United States, and you TOTALLY ignored it. You make the assertion that NK is not all that bad as a regime (why are they on Bush's axis of evil then?). First of all, even if they don't violate human rights at all (which is an absurd position), the MILITARY threat NK poses the US is enough to push it over the top. While its easy to create laundry lists (such as the one below) of all the awful things that countries have done (and I could probably create a reasonably shocking one for most countries, including the US, if I tried hard enough), US FP has to based on more hardheaded assessments of real threats to the US, along with (hopefully) more multilateral engagements to solve human rights atrocities across the globe. The point I was making above (and I said flat out it was \"infinitely more important than any of the other conditions on the list\") was that NK posed more of a real threat to the US than Iraq did, because its missiles could reach us, because it was investing in nuclear sub technology to dodge our ABM defense, and because it is one of the largest proliferaters of WMD material in the world (far more than Iraq). Indeed, as The New Republic  reported on March 19 2003:\n \n But, as scary as nuke-tipped North Korean missiles might be, they are not the biggest threat to the United States. More terrifying, Pyongyang could sell its fissile material on criminal black markets. In fact, more than Iraq, Iran, or even Al Qaeda, North Korea is perfectly positioned to proliferate fissile matter, for a reason that has gotten little recent attention: The North Korean diplomatic corps, over the last decade, has evolved into a global criminal network involved in counterfeiting, drug trafficking, and arms trading. This experience with illicit international transactions makes it far more plausible for North Korea to sell fissile material to, say, a Saddam Hussein or an Osama bin Laden. And missile defense would do nothing to stop it. \n\n To the extent that Iraq and Al-Qaeda could pose a direct threat to the US, NK is their route to it. Taking out NK would deal a far more crippling blow to these organizations than taking out Iraq did.\n \n Second, while no one is alleging that NK offered asylum to Bin Laden, or payed suicide bombers money, it is guilty of spectacularly repressive practices (and let's be honest, does it really matter if it kills its dissidents with chemical weapons vs. plain old bullets?). The US State Department reports on NK's human rights situation:\n \n Defectors and refugees report that the regime executes political prisoners, opponents of the regime, some repatriated defectors, and others (reportedly including military officers suspected of espionage or of plotting against Kim Jong Il). Criminal law makes the death penalty mandatory for activities \"in collusion with imperialists\" aimed at \"suppressing the national liberation struggle.\" Some prisoners are sentenced to death for such ill-defined \"crimes\" as \"ideological divergence,\" \"opposing socialism,\" and other \"counterrevolutionary crimes.\" In some cases, executions reportedly were carried out at public meetings attended by workers, students, and school children. Executions also have been carried out before assembled inmates at places of detention. Border guards reportedly have orders to shoot-to-kill potential defectors\n ...\n Religious and human rights groups outside the country report that members of underground churches have been killed because of their religious beliefs and suspected contacts with overseas evangelical groups operating across the Chinese border\n ...\n The Government reportedly is responsible for cases of disappearance. According to defector reports, individuals suspected of political crimes often are taken from their homes by state security officials late at night and sent directly, without trial, to camps for political prisoners. There also have been reports of past government involvement in the kidnaping abroad of South Koreans, Japanese, and other foreign nationals. As many as 20 Japanese may have been kidnapped and detained in North Korea. According to Japanese government officials, these abductions took place between 1977 and 1983. Following a December 1999 meeting between officials from the Red Cross societies of North Korea and Japan, the Government agreed to conduct an investigation into the fate of the missing Japanese nationals. However, on December 17, the Government announced it was suspending the investigation. In addition several suspected cases of kidnaping, hostage-taking, and other acts of violence apparently intended to intimidate ethnic Koreans living in China and Russia have been reported. There were unconfirmed reports that North Korean agents kidnaped a South Korean citizen, Reverend Dongshik Kim, in China and took him to North Korea in January 2000. There is credible evidence that North Korea may have been involved in the July 1995 abduction of a South Korean citizen working in China as a missionary. This missionary subsequently appeared publicly in North Korea and was portrayed as a defector. The DPRK denies that it has been involved in kidnapings. \n ...\n The nongovernmental organization (NGO) Human Rights without Frontiers reported refugee accounts that beginning in 2000 prison authorities ordered that newborn babies be put to death, and that a number of babies were killed over the past 2 years. A former North Korean prison guard at a camp reported that guards abused female prisoners sexually. \n \n In 1998 a Polish newspaper reported the experiences of a woman who spent 10 years in a North Korean concentration camp before fleeing first to China and then to South Korea. The approximately 1,800 inmates in this particular camp typically worked 16 to 17 hours a day. The woman reported severe beatings, torture involving water forced into a victim's stomach with a rubber hose and pumped out by guards jumping on a board placed across the victim's abdomen, and chemical and biological warfare experiments allegedly conducted on inmates by the army. South Korean media reported that the DPRK State Security Agency manages the camps through use of forced labor, beatings, torture, and public executions. \n \n Prison conditions are harsh. International NGO's and defector sources contend that whole families, including children, are imprisoned together. \"Reeducation through labor\" is common punishment, consisting of forced labor, such as logging and tending crops, under harsh conditions. A small number of persons who claimed to have escaped from detention camps reported that starvation and executions are common. In one prison, clothing reportedly was issued only once in 3 years. Amnesty International has reported the existence of \"punishment cells,\" too low to allow standing upright and too small for lying down flat, where prisoners are kept for up to several weeks for breaking prison rules. Visitors to North Korea report observing prisoners being marched in leg irons, metal collars, or shackles. Amnesty International also has received reports that in some places of detention, prisoners are given little or no food and, when they contract illnesses, are denied medical care. Amnesty International believes that many die of starvation and disease. \n\n Enough for you? (and I guess the bullets vs. sarin argument is moot, since apparently they ARE killing their citizens with bio/chem weapons)",

   "Just a word on Port Security, I agree with y'all, that's a huge issue. But while Sen. Kerry has made it a centerpiece of his homeland security plan, Bush has been apathetic, at best, about improving it.\n \n Look to The New Republic on March 3rd, 2003:\n \n [C]onsider port security. Ninety-five percent of America's imports get here via sea. Of the containers that make their way through our ports, though, only one in 50 is ever searched. As Stephen Flynn, a former Coast Guard commander who directed the Council on Foreign Relations' homeland security report, told a TV interviewer last month, \"We have virtually no security there.\" The Coast Guard has estimated it would cost $1 billion immediately and another $4.5 billion over the next nine years to make domestic ports sufficiently secure. But, since September 11, they've received just $318 million. One program, the Container Security Initiative, which would screen cargo at foreign ports, was specifically endorsed by Bush last June. \"The Customs Service,\" he told an audience in Port Elizabeth, New Jersey, \"is working with overseas ports and shippers to improve its knowledge of container shipments, assessing risk so that we have a better feel of who we ought to look at, what we ought to worry about.\" And yet Bush's budget provides not one new penny of funding for the program. \n\n \n The sad thing is, Bush has taken this soft position consistently on all Homeland Security measures since even right after 9/11. The article continues:\n \nWorking together, [Rep. David] Obey [D-WI] and [Rep. Bill] Young [R-CA] compiled a list of the most immediate security needs neglected in the first round of funding. They decided that only those items agreed upon by both parties would make the list. \"We stripped the list down to its bare essentials,\" Obey recalls. \"When that was done, I asked my staff to cut the remaining list in half to make sure there was absolutely no 'soft stuff.'\" They came up with a list that was very hard to argue with--computer upgrades for the FBI, improved security for ports and nuclear facilities, new customs agents, and other top homeland security priorities totaling about $10 billion. On November 6, 2001, Obey and Young, along with their Senate counterparts Robert Byrd and Ted Stevens, were ushered into the White House Cabinet Room to meet with President Bush. \"I understand some of you may want to spend more money on homeland security than we have requested,\" Bush told them, according to members of both parties who attended. \"My good friend [Budget Director] Mitch Daniels here assures me that our [$20 billion funding] request is adequate. ... I want to make it clear that if Congress appropriates one dollar more than we have requested, I will veto the bill.\" \n\n \n Port Security is a gaping weakness in our Homeland Defense perimeter. It would be nice if President Bush viewed it as a priority, rather than a photo-op.",

But lets break down the phrase \"weapons of mass destruction.\"\n Are mustard gas shells weapons? yep. Are they still weapons if they don't work? Maybe (a jammed rifle is still a weapon in my view). Can they destroy things? Sure can. Do they engage in \"mass\" destruction? Not in the normal context of the word\n In the context of WMD's, the \"mass\" refers to being able to take out cities or regions, killing millions in one blow. A mustard gas shell can't come close to doing this. Hence, it doesn't fulfill the \"mass\" requirement of \"weapons of mass destruction.\" On the flip side, I guess Iraq DID have WD's! On the other hand, so do the crips, the bloods, and most of the residents of Texas. Oops.\n \n Btw, I hope I'm not the only one who laughed when I saw the syllogism conclusion \"Therefore they are weapons. Therefore, they are weapons of mass destruction.\" That's outrageously funny. Wait, wait, let me try one.\n \n \"NRA members have guns. Guns are weapons. Therefore, guns are weapons of mass destructions, and the NRA possesses WMD's!\"\n \n Hey, that was strangely satisfying...\n \n Since you have an annoying tendancy to avoid the parts of arguments that are weakest to your case, I'm going to spell out the specific questions I want answered.\n 1) Why you shouldn't be censured (I mean that in the moral sense) by this board after being caught making intellectually dishonest and distorted statements on the Bush: The Republican Flipflopper Thread. You haven't made the slightest effort to defend or even justify those statements, despite the fact that these allegations reveal a performative contradiction on your part (see the Kinsella article). (I guess there is a 1a to that, why isn't it a performative contradiction for you to claim John Kerry is a horrible person for distortions he's made on the campaign trail, while it is ok for you to make similar distortions on these boards?)\n 2) Why North Korea is less of a threat than Iraq, despite having Nuclear Missiles that can actually hit US soil.\n 3) What capabilities Iraq had to do major, direct harm to US soil (as opposed to the mere desire to do so) without ICBM's or any realistic chance of getting them (unless via arms smuggling by, you guessed it, North Korea).\n 4) In abscence of other factors, is humaniterean grounds alone enough for a foreign policy intervention by the US (for example, in Darfur or the Congo).\n 5) Should we invade North Korea?\n \n I look forward to your response",

   "Again, I don't know of all the pros and cons that were weighed in the decision making process. I can think of a few obvious pros:\n \n [*]Saddam needed kicking[*]Saddam was thumbing his nose at UN sanctions[*]Saddam had weapons of mass destruction[*]Saddam was torturing and killing his own people[*]Saddam was developing nuclear weapons[*]Saddam already invaded Kuwait once[*]Saddam set oil fields on fire and polluted the world's atmosphere[*]Saddam is an ugly bastard\n Once we got started, there was no turning back. We can't just cut and run at this time. When relative stability is attained in Iraq, we can move on to another country.\n \n This does not mean that nothing at all has been done on other fronts in the war against terrorism.\n\n let me assist you with a few cons:[*]saddam did not murder thousands of americans on 9/11[*]saddam did not recruit, train or deploy terrorists[*]Saddam had only weapons capability, no wmds were ever found[*]Saddam did not rally fundamentalist muslims into anti-american hatred[*]Saddam did not bomb us embassies, or by any actions threaten us citizens[*]pakistan, iran, syria, sudan, jordan, palestine and about a dozen other countries, excluding iraq, are known to have terrorist activities and plots RIGHT NOW[*]saddam had no relation to al qaeda or bin laden\n focus, jim... try and tie all that back to TERRORISM. defying the UN, invading kuwait and being ugly does not make you a terrorist. neither does polluting the air or retaining wmd capabilities (which is all saddam had). and killing his people has nothing to do with endangering america.\n \n now consider that every other country in the ME is run by a tyranical monarch that rules with an iron fist and actually habors and facilitate terrorism. and they all have ACTUAL wmds (not just capabilities). but thats still too broad...\n \n lets really focus. this war was sparked by the actions of bin laden and al qaeda, and by extension by fundamentalist anti-american terrorism. we havent captured bin laden or eliminated al qaeda, and we are not even attempting to address the other terrorist movements all over the middle east. instead, we totally bumrush iraq, a state that had no affiliation to bin laden or al qaeda, a state that had no capability to attack america, and no plans to either, a state that had absolutely nothing to do with terrorism.\n \n again, why did we make iraq our target? \n \n in other words, why are the other countries, terrorist states, terrorist groups and bin laden himself not targets? or not nearly as important targets?\n \n (and dont forget, your answer needs to mention war on terrorism somewhere)",

   "After the moral rationalizations people seem to get stuck on are removed (lots of dictators out there far worse than Saddam), reading Bush Senior's reasoning behind not taking Saddam out and occupying Iraq and countless other valid examples and opinions of why Iraq posed no threat to the US or had anything to do with 9/11, what's left?
