   "OK folks, I'll admit this. I am afraid for my country. As you are well aware, I have lived in the People's Republic of New York all my life. Now, New York has been run by Liberals for decades and we have an ongoing exodus of people and businessesleaving the state until all we have left are welfare recipients and government workers. No thriving private sector economy outside of the armpit (NYC). And this, I'm afraid is what will happen as Liberals consolidate their power in the US. What has the GOP done?? For the most part they've been nothing but a bunch of wussies. Kowtowing to the Left in order to \"reach across the aisle\" for \"bipartisanship\". I see the same thing, here in New York. A totally impotent GOP. This my friends, I'm afraid, is the same thing happening across the country.",
