   "Back to our topic!\n \n Atheist Becomes Theist: Exclusive Interview with Former Atheist Antony Flew \n \n by Dr. Gary Habermas, \"a prolific philosopher and historian from Liberty University who has debated Flew several times.\"\n HABERMAS: You mentioned that this initial influence contributed in part to your comment that naturalistic efforts have never succeeded in producing &#8220;a plausible conjecture as to how any of these complex molecules might have evolved from simple entities.&#8221; \n \n \n FLEW: I think that the most impressive arguments for God&#8217;s existence are those that are supported by recent scientific discoveries. I&#8217;ve never been much impressed by the kalam cosmological argument, and I don&#8217;t think it has gotten any stronger recently. However, I think the argument to Intelligent Design is enormously stronger than it was when I first met it. \n \n HABERMAS: So you like arguments such as those that proceed from big bang cosmology and fine tuning arguments? \n \n FLEW: Yes\n \n HABERMAS: So of the major theistic arguments, such as the cosmological, teleological, moral, and ontological, the only really impressive ones that you take to be decisive are the scientific forms of teleology? \n \n FLEW: Absolutely.\n \n \n HABERMAS: Since you affirm Aristotle&#8217;s concept of God, do you think we can also affirm Aristotle&#8217;s implications that the First Cause hence knows all things? \n \n FLEW: I suppose we should say this. I&#8217;m not at all sure what one should think concerning some of these very fundamental issues. There does seem to be a reason for a First Cause, but I&#8217;m not at all sure how much we have to explain here. What idea of God is necessary to provide an explanation of the existence of the universe and all which is in it? \n \n HABERMAS: If God is the First Cause, what about omniscience, or omnipotence? \n \n FLEW: Well, the First Cause, if there was a First Cause, has very clearly produced everything that is going on. I suppose that does imply creation &#8220;in the beginning.&#8221; \n \n HABERMAS: In God and Philosophy, and in many other places in our discussions, too, it seems that your primary motivation for rejecting theistic arguments used to be the problem of evil. In terms of your new belief in God, how do you now conceptualise God&#8217;s relationship to the reality of evil in the world? \n \n FLEW: Well, absent revelation, why should we perceive anything as objectively evil? The problem of evil is a problem only for Christians.\n \n HABERMAS: In your view, then, God hasn&#8217;t done anything about evil. \n \n FLEW: No, not at all, other than producing a lot of it. \n \n HABERMAS: Given your theism, what about mind-body issues? \n \n FLEW: I think those who want to speak about an afterlife have got to meet the difficulty of formulating a concept of an incorporeal person.\n \n HABERMAS: I agree that near death experiences do not evidence the doctrines of either heaven or hell. But do you think these evidential cases increase the possibility of some sort of an afterlife, again, given your theism? \n \n FLEW: I still hope and believe there&#8217;s no possibility of an afterlife. \n \n HABERMAS: What do you think about the Bible? \n \n FLEW: The Bible is a work which someone who had not the slightest concern about the question of the truth or falsity of the Christian religion could read as people read the novels of the best novelists. It is an eminently readable book.\n \n \n SOURCE - Click Here",
