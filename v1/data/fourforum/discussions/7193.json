   "I'd like to know what Kiev is concretely going to do in order to avoid development of \"gas conflict\" with Russia. I consider \"gas war\" may lead to peace if Ukraine would like to continue the talks constructively. And the more especially as it has all necessary things for it. 9 months ago Yuschenko knew exactly that Russia had to increase prices for gas, because of the rising world tariffs for exported gas. Moreover, Ukrainian President stated that he had enough money for it. But now it seems to me Yuschenko prefers to spend the money (including our financial assistance) for election campaign or, maybe, for next jump in his dropping to zero popularity. And it is a crime that Ukrainian leadership counts on European support in settlement its problems and it even dreams of solving its financial difficulties for the account and risk of our Europe! It is not important for us that Ukrainian authorities have decided to discipline their own population. It is not the first time when Ukrainian people have to victual and fuel in expectation of economic collapse and famine. The matter is that now Ukraine wants to hold Europe hostage, threatening with breakdowns in vital winter fuel supplies to European countries. It's time for our authorities to recognize that dodgy intriguers (instead of democratic reformers) have come to power in Ukraine as a result of \"orange revolution\" there. It obvious they are worse than previous powers. And it is about time EU brought Ukraine to its bearings!",
