   "Democrats supported slavery, segregation, and voted agaisnt the civil rights act. So why does everyone think ti's republicans that are racists?\n \n \n January 7, 2004\n \n \n \n Justifiably confident going into the election cycle, Republicans have announced they hope to win 25 percent of the black vote. Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich has great expectations. \"If we get African American votes, [the Democrats] are in deep trouble\", he told the Washington Post. Not just any trouble. Deep trouble, he says.\n \n Columnist Jonetta Rose Barras agrees, citing black voters' growing dissatisfaction with the Democrat Party that resulted in Arnold Schwarzenegger winning 17 percent of the vote and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg garnering 22 percent.\n \n The statistics portend good things for Republicans. According to the oft-cited Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies 2002 political survey, 63 percent of blacks self-identified themselves as Democrats (down from 74 percent in 2000), 24 percent self-identified as Independents (up from 20 percent in 2000) and 10 percent self-identified as Republicans (up from 4 percent in 2000).\n \n Regardless of how blacks self-identify, however, Democrats consistently get 90 percent of their vote. Why? Years of damage caused by liberal ideology and misinformation pumped into the black community for the past 25 years. Memo to Republicans: Popping up in black church services and doing sound bites on urban radio won't cut it.\n \n Blacks have been lied to about the history of the Republican party and civil rights. Historically, blacks voted for Republicans because Democrats were blatantly anti-civil rights (and in some ways still are). For example, \"radical\" Republicans of the 1860s supported slavery's end in America, the Civil Rights Acts of 1866 and 1964 were opposed by Democrats (Senator Robert Byrd participated in a filibuster of the latter) and Jim Crow was a creation of Democrats.\n \n In the 1960s, Democrats blocked school doorways while Republicans pushed de-segregation legislation. In 2004, Democrats continue to block school doorways while Republicans push school choice, the only hope many black parents have to ensure that their kids get a decent education.\n \n So why did blacks switch from voting for Republicans in large numbers to voting for Democrats? Some say it was President John F. Kennedy's perceived sensitivity to the oppression of minorities that endeared him and the party to black Americans, and they've been voting for Democrats in droves ever since.\n \n Aside from revisionist history, a more fundamental rift exists between blacks and Republicans. The concept of limited government-a core Republican principle-is anathema to most blacks, even wealthy, well-educated ones. Thanks to the handiwork of Southern Democrats, blacks continue to turn to the federal government for redress of the slightest racial grievance.\n \n Conservatives have a healthy distrust of the federal government and believe its powers should be limited to only those enumerated in the U.S. Constitution. To most blacks, however, limited government brings to mind \"states' rights\", which in turn evokes images of Southern whites and their resentment of federal intervention in local affairs during de-segregation.\n \n The rights of the states are at the heart of a good constitutional republic, but blacks won't easily forget it was the federal government that enforced their civil rights after Reconstruction, got them jobs under the New Deal and protected them from billy clubs, dogs and water hoses in the 1960s. Do you blame them for believing a bloated, central bureaucracy is still their savior even in 2004?\n \n Republicans should keep emphasizing that the federal government is not supposed to have this much control over the people. The U.S. Supreme Court most recently usurped the will of the people by finding a non-existent Constitutional basis for continued race discrimination, although it was legally abolished in 1964. In 1973, they usurped the will of the people by discovering a non-existent \"right to privacy\" to kill unborn babies. Favoring a strong, forceful central government was once a matter of survival for blacks generations ago but no longer.\n \n Given this elemental divide between blacks and Republicans, courting them won't be easy. But the most important advantage Republicans have over Democrats is that Republicans can win elections without the black vote; Democrats can't.\n \n In the meantime, Republicans should continue to do what they do best: defending the country, supporting policies that foster economic growth, fighting for the sanctity of the family, the unborn and the dignity of the individual.\n \n Once blacks are fed up with liberal lies, fear, resentment and mistrust (and being passed over for leadership positions), perhaps they'll return to the party that set them free. And once they get a taste of real freedom, Democrats will be in trouble. Deep trouble\n \n \n \n http://www.americasvoices.org/archives2004/BarberL/BarberL_010704.htm",

If you study fiscal and monetary policies then you'll understand that everything you learn in economics the GOP does.\n \n Also the woman does have the right to choose. We make gun owners and car woners liable for what happens so why not hold women and men equally responsible? Also the arguemnt that a fetus is part of a woman's body is a lie. Dna is the building block of any living organism. It is contained in any organic part of the human body. A fetus' DNA is different than a mother's DNA. That proves that a fetus is not part of the woman's body because it contians different DNA.\n \n Also the War thing is something different. If we are not suppose to have unilaterla aggression we should not have engaged in WWII besides Japan, Korean War, Kosovo, and many other wars. I believe there are many other antions that need to be \"checked\". THis is all subjective and not really relative to this post.",

   "mana'ia:\n \n The answer to your question is rather simple, and the root of your problem comes in terms of bad history, as black votes had shifted to the democrats well before the Kennedy admin. Blacks were reliable Republican votes (the party of Lincoln after all) until the FDR admin. As the Republicans became less and less progressive (moving away from TR and towards Hoover), there appeal to Blacks became less and less pronounced. When FDR made a good faith effort to court the black vote, they jumped ship. This created somewhat of an \"unholy alliance\" admidst the Democratic party between its traditional southern base and its new working class/minority base, a rift that first manifested itself in Strom Thurmond's bolting the party and running as a dixiecrat.\n \n Most blacks today are democrats because the old dixiecrats have moved to the republican party (strom thurmond and jessie helms starting the trend). The South as a whole has moved sharpley to the right, in 1956 Adlai E. Stevenson pretty much only won in the south against Eisenhower, in 2000 Gore couldn't take any of the south at all. Republican's traditional opposition to aff action (which as u said is not monolithic, u support it as a republican, i oppose it as a democrat) and perceived hostility to civil rights (as they have welcomed the old racists into the party) have all hurt republican outreach efforts.\n \n Mana'ia claims that republicans should focus on promoting the aspects of their party that appeal to Black voters (esp. socially conservative viewpoints which empirically blacks are more likely to agree with republicans than democrats). The problem is that Black distrust of republicans has reached the point where they don't trust intiatives that would be to their benefit solely because Republicans sponser them (the clearest example of this was Alabama black's rejection of Gov. Bob Riley's tax proposal which would revamp its utterly ridiculious tax rate that falls mostly on the poor and exempts virtually all of the limber and mining companies, who own 71% of the land but pay 2% of the property taxes). While black disenchantment with the democratic party is growing, they don't seem to view republicans as a viable alternative.",

This created somewhat of an \"unholy alliance\" admidst the Democratic party between its traditional southern base and its new working class/minority base, a rift that first manifested itself in Strom Thurmond's bolting the party and running as a dixiecrat.\n \n Most blacks today are democrats because the old dixiecrats have moved to the republican party (strom thurmond and jessie helms starting the trend). The South as a whole has moved sharpley to the right, in 1956 Adlai E. Stevenson pretty much only won in the south against Eisenhower, in 2000 Gore couldn't take any of the south at all. Republican's traditional opposition to aff action (which as u said is not monolithic, u support it as a republican, i oppose it as a democrat) and perceived hostility to civil rights (as they have welcomed the old racists into the party) have all hurt republican outreach efforts.\n \n Mana'ia claims that republicans should focus on promoting the aspects of their party that appeal to Black voters (esp. socially conservative viewpoints which empirically blacks are more likely to agree with republicans than democrats). The problem is that Black distrust of republicans has reached the point where they don't trust intiatives that would be to their benefit solely because Republicans sponser them (the clearest example of this was Alabama black's rejection of Gov. Bob Riley's tax proposal which would revamp its utterly ridiculious tax rate that falls mostly on the poor and exempts virtually all of the limber and mining companies, who own 71% of the land but pay 2% of the property taxes). While black disenchantment with the democratic party is growing, they don't seem to view republicans as a viable alternative.\n\n Sorry my hand is broke so I can't really type.\n \n There really isn't any evidence that the racist moved to the GOP. Sen Byrd is still a Democrat. While Strom Thurmond was a segragationist he never belonged to the KKK. All the democrats thst opposed the civil rights act remained democrats.\n \n Tax rates are a bit tricky. Most corporations don't pay very many taxes because they want to help the corps. They feel its better to keep jobs available and get taxes than to cripple the corp. \n \n If you give poor tax cuts they'll spend their money at businesses and the business owners will profit with no incentive to spend. So tax cuts must be given to incentivize the rich to spend and keep the money flowing.",

Other prominent Republican figures who have been actively opposed to civil rights are Jessie Helms and Trent Lott.\n\n \n Poor DSA. You misinformed LDer.Throughout the 1960's, Byrd was was one of the staunchest opponents to civil rights in the U.S. Senate. Byrd's racist history drew attention recently when he went on national television and repeatedly used nigger in an appearance on national television. Byrd uttered the slur on Fox News Sunday with Tony Snow on March 5, 2001. Despite the appalling nature of the remark, it went largely ignored by the mainstream media and the self appointed \"civil rights\" leadership.\n \n Also during Strom Thurmond's move from independent the Democrats were still a racist party. He actually ran as part of the Democratic party when he ran for president.\n \n He was governor from 1947 to 1951. He married Jean Crouch (1926-1960), daughter of Horace J. and Inez Breazeale Crouch of Elko, South Carolina in 1947; they had no children. Objecting to the 1948 nomination of Harry S Truman for President by the National Democratic Party, Thurmond ran as the presidential candidate of the States Rights' Democratic Party and won four southern states (Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina) and thirty-nine electoral votes. He ran unsuccessfully against Olin D. Johnston for U.S. Senator in 1950. Thurmond was the Chairman of Southern Governor's Conference in 1950.\n \n Upon the death of U.S. Senator Burnet Rhett Maybank in 1954, Thurmond ran as a write-in candidate for Senator against the nominee of the South Carolina Democratic Party, Edgar Brown. He defeated Brown in the primary, becoming the first person in U.S. history to be elected to a major office by write-in ballot. Thurmond resigned from the Senate in 1956 in fulfillment of a campaign promise and was re-elected to the Senate that same year. \n \n \n He switched from the Democratic to the Republican Party in 1964 and aided Barry Goldwater in his unsuccessful bid for the Presidency against Lyndon Johnson. Thurmond was instrumental in the \"southern strategy\" that won the White House for Richard M. Nixon in 1968. Thurmond is the author of The Faith We Have Not Kept (1968). \n \n http://www.strom.clemson.edu/strom/bio.html\n \n Senator Ernest Hollings, D-SC: Hollings is liberal Democrat Senator from\n South Carolina who is also notorious for his use of racial slurs. He\n rose out of the Democrat Party's segregationist wing in the 1960's as\n governor of South Carolina. While in office as governor, Hollings\n personally led the opposition to lunch counter integration in his state.\n \n In more recent years Hollings, a senior Democrat senator, has made\n disparaging racial remarks and slurs against minorities. Senator\n Hollings, who was a contender for his party's presidential nomination in\n 1984, blamed his defeat in the primaries by using a racial slur against\n Hispanics. After losing the Iowa Straw Poll, Hollings stated \"You had\n wetbacks from California that came in here for Cranston,\" referring to\n one of his opponents, Alan Cranston. A few years later Hollings\n reportedly used the slur \"darkies\" to derogatorily refer to blacks. He\n also once disparagingly referred to the Rainbow PUSH Coalition as the\n \"Blackbow Coalition,\" and called former Senator Howard Metzenbaum, who\n is Jewish, \"the Senator from B'nai B'rith.\" Hollings gained\n international criticism for his remarks about the African Delegation to\n the 1993 Geneva GATT conference, where he crudely remarked \"you'd find\n these potentates from down in Africa, you know, rather than eating each\n other, they'd just come up and get a good square meal in Geneva.\"\n Hollings was also the Governor of South Carolina who raised the\n confederate flag over the state capitol in the early 1960's in what was\n considered at the time to be an act of defiance to civil rights. The\n press ignored Hollings and his role in the flag issue at the same time\n the political correctness police were smearing George W. Bush during his\n campaign after Bush correctly remarked that the flag was a state issue\n to be decided upon by South Carolina and not the national government.\n \n \n \n \n \n\n Moving to taxes:\n First of all, I'd echo George's concern about just how many poor people pay taxes (since we generally exempt them).

   "Right. There were (as expected) factions within the one existing party (Republican).\n \n [Does this mean that all Democrats are decendents of Republicans?]\n\n United States Democratic-Republican Party\n The Democratic-Republican party was a United States political party, which evolved early in the history of the United States. In addition, some refer to the party as the Jeffersonian Republicans since Thomas Jefferson belonged to the party and had a major influence on its ideology; it is also referred to as simply the Republican Party, not to be confused with the modern Republican Party. This party should not be confused with Jeffersonian democracy, a term used to indicate the period when the government was run by aristocratic learned men, as opposed to the period of Jacksonian democracy where the common man ran the government.\n The origins of this party lie in the Anti-Federalist Party, the group that opposed the adoption of the United States Constitution and insisted on the Bill of Rights. After the Federalist presidency of John Adams, Thomas Jefferson became the first Democratic-Republican President.\n \n For a brief period, the Democratic-Republican Party was the sole dominant party in U.S. politics. At its apex, James Monroe ran virtually unopposed in the 1820 presidential election. This period was known as the Era of Good Feeling. Shortly afterward, the party would split into two factions: the Democratic Party, led by Andrew Jackson, and the Whig Party, which was formed from the anti-Jackson coalition.\n \n The following United States Presidents were members of the Democratic-Republican party:\n \n \n Thomas Jefferson (1801 - 1809) \n James Madison (1809 - 1817) \n James Monroe (1817-1825) \n John Quincy Adams (1825-1829)\n \n Modern Claims To Democratic-Republican Heritage\n The stature of the Presidents who identified themselves with the Democratic-Republican Party during its heyday makes it an enviable institution for modern political parties to identify themselves with. As a result, both major political parties today identify themselves with the party.\n \n As noted above, the Democratic Party is a direct descendant of the Democratic-Republican Party. The Republican Party also sees itself as a spiritual descendant of the Democratic-Republicans, though it has much looser ties from their broad base of former Whig voters and politicians. Neither the modern-day Democratic nor Republican party has identifiable ties to the Federalist Party, which was the only opposition party to the original Democratic-Republican party.\n \n http://www.fact-index.com/u/un/united_states_democratic_republican_party.html",
