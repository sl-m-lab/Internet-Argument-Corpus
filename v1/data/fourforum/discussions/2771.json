Our goal is to try to stabilise oil supplies (which so far we have only managed to destabilise). \n \n Our current war had a lot less to do witht he fact that Saddam was a tyrant whom we thought had WMD's than that prior to the current gulf war, Saudi was in the process of expelling US troops from our bases there (a fact that has been glossed over pretty well).\n \n The odds of America actually managing to take a ME nation and hold it are slim to none. Isreal does not have the infrastructure to support the kind of bases we feel we need in the ME to ensure stability (or at leas tot ensure that things go our way). we htought that Kuwait would be our willing hosts after gulf I, but they had different ideas and put limits on our troop strenght there that were WELL below what we were after.\n \n The current war was nothing less than an attempt to craft a middle eastern nation that has the infrastructure to support, and the inclination to allow, large US bases.\n \n It is difficult to tell whether or not we will accomplish our goals in this regard. While we did manage to get Saddam ousted and turn over control of the mess to an appointed government of our choosing, the Iraqi people seem extremely resistant to the plan. It does not look now like thye will be able to manage to get our appointed PM elected (like we did in afghanistan) and it would appear that as long as there are US troops on Iraqi soil, there iwll be Iraqis killing them.\n \n To imply that the war was soley for the posession of oil is entirely incorrect.

   "Has anyone thought about the notion that direct US control of oil in the region could easily bring down global oil prices for the next couple decades, saving the US trillions in fuel costs, and therefore outweigh the amount of money we are pumping in?\n\n \n It's my understanding that oil is a finite resource with present and forecast consumption bringing peak production of known and unknown reserves around 2015 at the outside, sooner if China's future requirements (expected to equal and possibly surpass US consumption before the end of this decade) aren't reduced by their very aggressive alternative fuels programs. \n \n Oil is a commodity and I can't see our physical presence in the ME, regardless of military strength levels short of an accepted 1-4 occupation ratio for total dominance, ever stabilizing anything where hatred of our ideology permeates a substantial portion of the general populace. Vital commodities such as oil create violent market disruptions when supplies are endangered and it takes very little logistical planning for a dedicated guerrilla force to create ongoing problems with of hundreds and hundreds of miles of exposed pipelines. \n \n IMO we made a very bad call with the invasion and occupation of Iraq. Our former policies of letting Israel play gunslinger to keep the ME politically destabilized furnished far more market stability than our physical presence has provided. And was far less expensive. Once troops were removed after the 1991 Gulf War, oil prices immediately stabilized. \n \n While oil was certainly a prime consideration in the invasion and occupation of Iraq, I still view the military action used as a dramatic method of refocusing the US public from 9/11 and our economic woes.

I think he is refering to the Hubbard curve. Hubbert was a geologist who helped develop methods for estimating oil production. He showed that oil production for any given field is not linear. It rises (as the field is developed) then falls off as the wells are pumped lower. It is not just a question of the field being depeleted, it is a matter of how fast you can actually get it out of the ground. this is for a variety of geological reasons (and no, just sinking more wells on the same field will not help). \n \n By applying Hubberts fromula to the worlds oil supply, we see that around 2008-2010 the worldwide supply of oil will start to fall (though some have claimed ity may be earlier). Currently, we are sitting on top of \"Hubberts peak\". The problem, of course, is that even though availablity of oil will start declining, demand will, of course, continue to increase leaving us with a fairly large energy deficit. \n \n Most oil companies acknowledge that we have already found all of the worlds substantial oil fields.",

We consume what, 45% of world production on a constantly increasing demand curve? And supply 35% of that number with domestic production on a diminishing reserve basis? Former USSR states are in the process of coming on line with their large reserves, which China, Russia will dominate, Canada is now the #2 supplier to the US, Nigeria supplies 12% of our import requirements and others lesser amounts.

In particular, the massive trade imbalance that steadily drains our national wealth with zero possibility of recovery, the debt we're incurring to live way beyond our means (fielding that 'untouchable military') and our dependency on foreign purchases of our treasury issues to sustain that deficit spending. You are familiar with what caused the decline of the Roman Empire's 'untouchable military'? When you respond, please include instructions on how to 'fix' the 30-year decline of the dollar and how our declining work force will shoulder what looks like a very scary future tax burden. Then we can discuss the oil issue on a reasonable level.\n\n\n \n Well, I never claimed to be smug enough to have all the answers, but apparently you do.

Nations far greater than America have risen and fallen, and the world continues. Personally, I care very little either way. There is financial opportunity in stability, and there is financial opportunity in chaos. Personally, I would like to see the decline and rebuilding of America. America has gone from a wholesome nation to one so corrupt that it is almost impossible to weed it out any more. Our government is controlled by special interests and our election process has been sullied by our two parties, which have effectively ensured that no canidate not carefuly vetted has a reasonable chance of election.\n \n Personally, I would prefer to see America rebound and pull though this. the numebrs say it is simply not possible. There is simply not enough money left in America toof oot the bill. It took years to build America from a disobediant little colony to the world premier superpower both militarily and in an industrial capacity. All that has been looted and destroyed.

LMAO They have eyes and yet do not see\n\n \n I don't think George was implying that it was simply military spending that is the problem here. If so, i would have to disagree. As our single largest expenditure, the military is undoubtedly a huge drain on our nation. On the flip side, though, our military expeditures are what allows our government to present the polished GDP numbers that they have (along with some other nifty tricks they have pulled in the recent past). The defense industry in America, including the industries that exist soley for the purpose of supporting it and the industries that exist soley because of the defense industyr, make up a HUGE portion of Americas industiral economy as a whole. It is similar to Germany prior to WWII, where their entire economic model was based on their military industry (VERY similar in fact, this is worth exploring if you are truly interested).\n \n As far as social programs.....this is still a cpaitolistic society. In capitolisitic societies, social programs are generally the result of a bad economy, not the cause of one. We allow social programs not because we generally truly care about the poor, but because it is cheaper to buy them off collectively than to fight them off individually. \n \n There is a somewhat interesting thread at http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?goto=newpost&t=2674 where the benifits of taxation are discussed at some length. \n \n In addition to the reasons outlined there, social programs also provide false economic stimulation, which allows our governemnt to hand soothing numbers to the masses, who apparently are gullible enough to believe that if you can fly a flag over it, it must be good.\n \n \n This is not a case of pessimism any more than the beliefe that you are in deep trouble when somebody is holding a gun to your head could be considered pessimism. You look at the numebrs, you d o the math, and it quickly becomes apparent that we are in real trouble here.",

The last time I was overseas, I bought a new Harley at Kuwait Harley Davidson and had it shipped back to Ameirca because I saved thousands of dollars doing it that way as opposed to buying it at the factory, which is 100 miles from my house. We just passed a huge prescription drug plan, a trillion dollar plan (though we have no idead how we are going to foot that bill) and at the same time are fighting to keep people from re-importing American drugs because it is apparently cheaper to ship them to canada, sell them at the consumer level there, then ship them back to the US. The drug companies, which were big supporters of the bill, claim that unless they are allowed to gouge the American market, they cannot afford to keep up R&D efforts, and the American public, being the gullible fools we all know we are, swallowed this whole. From a realistic standpoint, these companies are posting profits in the billions of dollars, and the only realistic gains they can expect come from R&D development. Even if we took away their ability to screw the American public, they would still fund R&D. they would just loose half their profits doing it. Froma realistic standpoint, even if they only made 1 billion in profit instead of 2 billion per year, they would still be in good shape. Instead, the American public will continue to get screwed over by these guys because they have thrown around enough money in the right places to buy the privelage.",

I think that we need to keep in mind that it would absolutly be to the oil companies benifit to see oil production peak and start down the back side of the hill, while production continues to rise. They will make billions selling oil at a higer profit, and they secured their nest eggs years ago by investing in the more practical alternative energy methods (solar, wind, tidal, geothermal, etc...). There is a pretty serious hole in our energy policy in this regard. We have asked people who stand to make billions through the decline of oil production to ensure that we do not see a decline in oil production. form a realsitic standpoint, we have been fed enough oil for the last several years to ensure that nobody is making serious investment in alternative energy sources, whihc is effectively allowing the oil companies to corner that market before we all relaise that it is needed. \n \n There is a reason that Exxon and Shell are investing over a billion per year in alternative energy research, and it isn't because they think we have enough oil to be able to sustain current consumption for another 50 years.\n \n \n \nNot so sure.

Apparently there's a machine in Berkeley (?) that can turn rubbish into oil.\n\n \n \n Currently such devices are not cost efficient, but as we see the price of oil go through the roof, they will quickly become practical from a cost standpoint. \n \n Personally, I think the best bet we have for alternative energy sources (electrical) is biomass gasification. There are scale problems (you cannot efficiently build and operate units over about 100 MW), but they are perfect for decentralised supplemental power. I have a small unit (45kw) that was bult for a research project at work. I run it on wood chips that I get from the local dump (they have literally hundreds of tons of these frome tree trimming operations and the yearly christmas tree shredding). I keep it around becuae my power goes out fairly frequently (pretty much any time we get a storm or the wid blows too hard.....one of the problems with living out in the middle of nowhere). When the power goes off, the unit kicks on automaticall, and within 10 minutes is generating more than enough power to operate the entire house. It burns about 150 LBS of woodchips per day.\n \n While shipping fuel for such a device quickly destroys any profit, they would be perfect for agricultural areas, or saw mills, or any nut processing plant. They don;t have to pay to have silage, nut hulls, sawdust, etc.. hauled off, and they produce useful power. It is a win-win proposition.",

   "I notice, as with most reports, that China, somewhat lacking in natural resources in relation to geographical mass, is totally ignored with regard to natural resource consumption, including oil.

They are trying to ensure that as we do make the transition from oil, we are still putting money in their poskets. Currently, British Petroleum is positioning itself in the gulf of Mexico to operate in a manner that is currently illegal. The only logic I can see in this is that they are expecting legislation to lighten up as we start seeing oil shortages in the next 5-10 years. \n \n \nOh. Wait, have they checked Antartica? Oil is a hydrocarbon made from the decomposition of organic matter. Antartica was once full of jungles and forests. \n \n \n Yes, the composition of the earths crust under antarctica is primarily sedimentary clay and non-porous igneous rock (mostly granite). Not a likely place to find oil.\n \n \nhow much woodchips does it take to produce that much power and what is the pollution rate?\n\n \n This depends largely on the design of the gasifier and its efficincy level, as well as the particualr fuel being fed to the unit. the larges test unit we built and operated was a 40MW unit (electrical output). We found that using municipal wood waste (shipped tree limbs, etc...) and drying the fuel to a reasonable level (20% moisture) the unit consumed roughly 4 lbs of fuel per kwh of electricity produced. this is not bad, considering that our local dump takes in over 900 tons of wood waste per year (and this is a small town). \n \n From an environmental standpoint, it is a completely harmless technology. In a properly opertaing gasifier, emissions are basically carbon and water. There is also (of course) ash produced, but it makes an excellent fertilizer, so it is no big deal. This is assuming 100% efficiency, which does not happen. there is some CO2 released, but to the best of my knowledge no real study has been done on the exact amounts. This is becaue, frankly, it doesn't matter in this context. It certainly is less CO2 than would be given off if you left the same material to decompose on its own over time. Thisis the big difference between technologies like biomass gasification and fossile fuels. The CO2 emissions from fossile fuels are basically CO2 that has been locked awya in the earth for millions of years. For all intents and purposes, it is \"new\". The CO2 emmited by biomass will be released whether you use it or not. It is just natural, cyclic CO2.",

And they would be cleaner then oil, not to mention cheaper. A bunch of MIT (?) students did it and drove to Cali.\n\n \n Biodiesel is a nifty bit of technology (I have a biodiesel reactor left over from another work related project). Running a vehicle on SVO (straight vegetable oil....resteraunt grease waste) is a pretty poor idea, as evidenced by the fact that the vehicle they took their trip in eventually blew the motor. Much better to take that same waste and tur it into biodiesel. Unfortunatly, we will not see widespread adoption of biodiesel in this country until the giants start making it. The EPA has tied it up so badly that you are looking at $500,000.000 and change to be able to get it certified and sell it as fuel. That makes for a pretty serious startup cost, since it is more or less a regulatory fee, and provides no real benifit as far as production goes (basically you have to start your business by flushing half a million dollars down the toilet). It is really too bad, since that is one thing that could be carried out on a fairly small scale (100,000 gallons/month) by some industrious entrepeneurs. Instead, we will stand by and watch millions of gallons of used veggie oil (which is classified as a hazardous waste) per year get flushed into municipal landfills while our elected officials get up and publicly lament our lack of alternative energy sources. \n \n If you drive a diesel, you might seriously look into the construction of a biodiesel reacotr. They are cheap to build, and easy to operate. Your fuel ends up running about 35 cents per gallon. If anybody needs more info, PM me.\n \n \nHmmm. Wonder how they probed through hundreds if not thousands of feet of ice\n\n \n We drilled it waaaaay back in the 70's. It was quite the event at the time. We punched holes all over the place taking core samples. They even brought up some mummified vegetation. The consensus was that antarctica froze in such a relatively short time that there just wasn't time for th conditions to be met for transforming organic matter into oil.\n \n \nSo really, all your thing is, is a efficent, clean wood burning generator? \n \n \n Wood, paper waste, nut hulls, corn cobbs, silage, grass clipping, cottonseed hulls, wheat hulls, sugarcane, if it was once a living plant, you can stick it in a gasifier and turn it into power. Pretty nifty trick.\n \n \nWould that really work on a global scale?\n\n \n Yes and no. Several countries already have biomass gasifiers online in private industrial settings that are feeding the grid (india, for example, is producing about 21,000 mwh yearly). In theory, you could easily power the entire world on biomass. In reality, fuels supply problems prevent this from being feasible from an economic standpoint. The technology could easily provide half of our energy needs economically through decentralised installations which take advantage of locally available feedstocks. The key to this is environmentally friendly regulation. In order for this to work, we need net metering laws that require utilities to pay wholesale prices for power produced by these small producers. We need to quite looking at 12 months as \"long term\" in regards to our energy policy. Realistically, there is no need for us to ever have an energy crisis, but that seems to be the stimulus we want before exploiting known alternative energy technologies.",

   "oh, so that's how they do it. Something tells me we need a geolgist here. \n\n \n You called. :p \n \n I guess I should have read to the end of the thread before my last post, sort of.\n \n OK. Where to start. I can see that we're dealing in generalities and hearsay here, rather than facts and science.\n \n Reserves reporting - All reserves are reported in both gross and recoverable volumes. Every new field is modelled volumetrically to estimate the OOIP (original oil in place), by calculating rock porosity, total volume, water saturation, etc... It is then multiplied by a RF (recovery factor) of generally 5-20%, to get an IRO (Initial Recoverable Oil) volume. EOR (enhanced oil recovery) can increase the total recovery factor to as high as about 40% with current technology and time, giving you a TRO. These numbers are VERY carefully scrutinized by private and government agencies, as they form the basis of the oil business with regards to valuation of companies and oil fields.\n \n All of these numbers are reported and used in the USGS study that I linked to.\n \n Technology - Simply put, without a remarkable leap in technology, (the current advancements in technology, while proving to increase economically recoverable reserves, are simply not capable of meeting demand, regardless of oil prices), we WILL run out of oil, and it WILL happen sooner than later. IMHO, we have reached a plateau of technology. Current seismic exploration provides incredibly detailed 3D data of the earth's crust, if it's out there, we can find it with current technology. Really, it is that simple.\n \n Geology - The generation, migration, and entrapment of oil is miracle really. The number of variables that have to combine just right in order to hit oil with a drill bit are staggering. There is a VERY small portion of the earth in which the conditions for oil entrapment exist.\n \n North America - with the exception of National Parks and other off limits areas, there is barely a square foot of land out there than hasn't been examined, often it's been examined three or four times over the years.\n \n Europe - same deal.\n \n Russia - getting there, it's really one of the last continental frontiers. There's lots to explore, and lots of work already done that needs to be translated/updated.\n \n China - the Chinese have explored EXTENSIVELY. Self sufficiency has always been their goal, but their reserves are simply no match for their demand. The Chinese have contributed some brilliant geological work and theories that are slowly coming to light.\n \n Africa - A write off. Africa contains no (well, very few) sedimentary basins. Exploration is restricted to offshore deltas.\n \n Antarctica - other than the obvious challenges, much of Antarctica consist of shales and igneous/metamorphic rock as mentioned above.\n \n Continental shelves - Massively explored already. They have been covered in amazing detail by seismic imaging.\n \n Deep ocean - The deep ocean is simply not prospective. I don't know where that notion came from. emoticon_confused The crust is thin, made up of igneous rock, with very thin and immature (geologically speaking) sedimentary cover.\n \n Alternative fuels - Diesel from corn and garbage is all fine and dandy, but where does the corn and garbage come from? As of now, these materials produce fuel at an energy deficit. Ie - for every gallon of diesel generated, two were consumed. \n \n What would the ramifications of growing corn strictly for fuel production be?\n \n Don't get me wrong, it's a far better alternative than sending it to the landfill, just in no way a realistic REPLACEMENT for oil. \n \n Anyhoo, enough rambling. I'm more than willing to answer questions or help guide people to the best sources.\n \n Waxy",
