Although the left believes that American soldiers are expendable, blowing up a dog is way over the line; even for the left.\n =================================\n Explosives attached to a dog\n From correspondents in Kirkuk\n May 27, 2005\n \n IRAQ insurgents attached explosives to a dog today in a bid to bomb a military convoy near the northern oil centre of Kirkuk but the animal was the only casualty, police said.\n \n The insurgents wrapped an explosive belt around the dog's body and detonated it as the convoy passed through Dakuk, 40km south of Kirkuk, the town's police chief Colonel Mohammed Barzaji said.\n \n \"The dog was torn apart by the explosion which caused neither injury among the soldiers nor any damage,\" said Barzaji, adding that the bomb had been detonated outside a Shiite mosque.\n \n \"Eight suspects have been detained,\" he said.\n \n It is not the first time that animals have been used in insurgent attacks. In 2003, donkey carts were used to conceal makeshift multiple rocket launchers in a flurry of attacks in Baghdad.\n \n Animal carcasses and even human corpses have also been used to conceal explosives.\n \n http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5744,15421697%255E1702,00.html",

   "http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article3267.htm\n \n \nThe film provides eyewitness testimony that U.S. troops were complicit in the massacre of thousands of Taliban prisoners during the Afghan War. \n \n It tells the story of thousands of prisoners who surrendered to the US military's Afghan allies after the siege of Kunduz. According to eyewitnesses, some three thousand of the prisoners were forced into sealed containers and loaded onto trucks for transport to Sheberghan prison. Eyewitnesses say when the prisoners began shouting for air, U.S.-allied Afghan soldiers fired directly into the truck, killing many of them. The rest suffered through an appalling road trip lasting up to four days, so thirsty they clawed at the skin of their fellow prisoners as they licked perspiration and even drank blood from open wounds. \n \n Witnesses say that when the trucks arrived and soldiers opened the containers, most of the people inside were dead. They also say US Special Forces re-directed the containers carrying the living and dead into the desert and stood by as survivors were shot and buried. Now, up to three thousand bodies lie buried in a mass grave. \n\n \n http://www.wsws.org/articles/2003/mar2003/afgh-m17.shtml\n \n \nPrior to the German broadcast, a State Department spokesman, Larry Schwartz, declared: \"It is a mystery to us why a respected television channel is showing a documentary in which the facts are completely wrong and which unfairly depicts the US mission in Afghanistan.\" Following the December transmission, State Department officials once again denied any involvement by US troops in the killing of Taliban prisoners.\n \n Now the allegations raised in Doran's film have been confirmed for the first time by Afghan government officials. German reporters accompanied a small team representing the German parliamentary committee for Human Rights to Afghanistan on a trip to investigate the background to the events in Mazar-i-Sharif. In the course of their research, the reporters were able to briefly interview Rashid Dostum, who now occupies the post of joint Deputy Defence Minister of Afghanistan.\n \n In the interview, Dostum acknowledged that the killing of prisoners had taken place. He was not prepared to be drawn out, however, on the role played by US troops in these killings. Dostum shares the deputy post at the Afghan Defence Ministry with another general, Atig ullah Barialei, who was much more forthright and conceded that American troops were in attendance at this massacre.\n \n \n\n \n It looks like I got the 5000 wrong it should be I believe 3000\n \n\n The prisoners still in Shiberghan - half of them Afghans, and half Pakistanis - estimate that about 400 people suffocated to death during the journey. Other sources say the figure is between 900 and 1,000. The Physicians for Human Rights group from Boston, which identified the mass grave earlier this year and later sent out a forensic scientist to carry out further tests, suggests that 2,000-3,000 of the 8,000 prisoners taken to Shiberghan died on the way.\n \n But the Guardian has obtained harrowing details which suggest that their death was not a tragic accident but a deliberate act of revenge.\n \n Some of the first Taliban fighters to surrender made the initial part of the journey in open lorries, their faces caked with dust. When they reached Mazar-i-Sharif, 90 miles from Kunduz, they were taken to Qala Zaini, a mud-walled fortified compound on the outskirts of the city. There Gen Dostum's soldiers crammed them into shipping containers. When they protested that they could not breathe, the soldiers told them to duck down, then fired several Kalashnikov rounds into the containers.\n \n \"I saw blood coming out of the holes,\" an eyewitness who refuses to be identified said.\n \n A driver who made four trips to Dasht-i-Leili said not all the prisoners in his lorry were dead when they arrived: some were merely unconscious or gravely injured. The guards laid the dead and the still living out on the desert. \"They raked them all with bullets to make sure they were dead,\" the driver said. \"Then they buried them.\"\n \n Last week Gen Dostum, now deputy defence minister in the new Afghan government, angrily denied accusations of human rights abuses, and pointed out that the Taliban had used shipping containers on numerous occasions to murder their enemies. He admitted that 200 prisoners had died, but said that most of the deaths were \"due to wounds suffered in the fighting, but also due to disease, suffocation, suicide and a general weakness after weeks of intense fighting and bombardment\".\n \n In a joint statement with three other northern alliance commanders, he added: \"There was no intentional killing.\"\n \n What makes this massacre different from atrocities carried out by the Taliban regime is the presence of US special forces in the area, both at Shiberghan and at Erganak, 200 miles away, where the Taliban prisoners were first loaded into lorries. The question human rights groups want answered is: how much did the American soldiers know at the time?\n \n The Pentagon said last week that the US troops had reported that they were unaware what had happened to the prisoners. But the evidence suggests that they were so close to Gen Dostum's soldiers that they may have been informed.\n \n \nhttp://www.globalissues.org/Geopolitics/WarOnTerror/Massacre.asp?p=1",
