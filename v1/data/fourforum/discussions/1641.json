   "Ok any republican takers? Cause from my liberal view, I see no downside whatsoever to making all drugs legal and having them be sold by the government, and made by the government. \n \n \n It is not the job of our government's to \"make drugs\", nor sell them. They may govern the distribution, but they should not \"sell\" them. Take Pennsylvania for example...state liquor stores. While the employee who sits at the counter is technically a (state) government employee, he is a merchant. The liquor is still sold by the company that makes it. If it were done that way, I would have no problem with it. They purchase it initially, tax the hell out of it, and sell it to the population. Then, the governement would not be responsible for any deaths caused by the product. So long as they follow the prescribed laws concerning the distribution of the drug that is...\n \n \nIsn't that infringe on our right of freedom? Cause my entire view on life is in my signature, so as long as it doesn't effect anybody in ways they don't like, why can't we do it (do drugs of course)? \n \n \n Do speed limits infringe your right to freedom? Don't laws that say you must be 21 to drink alcohol infringe on the freedom of people under 21? Laws are made to account for the greatest benefit and safety of a society. The freedom argument is kinda out there. What kind of drugs are you speaking of in the first place? Marijuana...ok, no problem...I support the decriminalization of marijuana. Cocaine...ok, regular cocaine...fine. Crack...not a chance. Meth...no way. PCP...you must be joking. I think that all drugs should be taken on an individual basis...as they do with alcohol and tobacco.\n \n \nGangs will no longer be able to afford the guns they used to buy through drug money, government prices will be lower then drug-dealers and people will know the government's stuff is pure.\n \n \n You think gangs just sell drugs to buy guns? emoticon_rolleyes And since the government should not be selling it in the first place, it will not be their prices. But I would bet that with government tax, and controlled distribution, it would be more expensive than on the street, or at least the same price. \n \n \nKids will no longer be tempted to do drugs based on poor information, with the whole stigma of selling, buying and doing drugs gone, kids will make informed decisions based on information that isn't completely ridiculous. \n \n \n Like with tobacco and alcohol? Please. Kids will do them anyway, most kids don't make informed decisions about what to have for lunch...let alone what they smoke or drink. \n \n \nit would reduce funding for terrorism.\n \n \n Huh? You think that some Mexican marijuana farmer is giving his proceeds to Bin Laden? Some South American coca grower is donating his earnings to Hamas? Even the poppy farmers in the middle east are not funding terrorists, they are keeping their money, and getting rich in the process. Growing opium in the middle east is a legitimate business, just like growing corn is in the mid west. \n \n \nit will lower suicide rates because now psychologists can prescribe drugs to treat serious mental illness that can be administered from the home, and are very cheap.\n \n \n Psychologists do not prescribe drugs. Psychiatrists prescribe drugs. We already have many drugs to treat serious mental illness, which can be taken in the home. Many of them are available free at mental health clinics. While marijuana tends to help some people relax and relieve anxiety, it can sometimes have the opposite effect. And many of the illegal street drugs you are thinking of have little use in mental health cases. Some are great pain killers (opium, heroin), others are good for relieving nausea, stimulating appetite, and reducing the effects and pain of narrow angle glaucoma (marijuana), some to act as anesthetic agents (cocaine) etc... Few illegal street drugs would find any meaningful use in psychiatry. \n \n \nlegalizing drugs will eventually lead to safer more user-friendly ways to get high. Eliminating the addictive, harmful drugs currently on the streets. \n \n \n I don't get this one at all? What is a safer, more user friendly way to get high? You make it sound as if it is approved by the FDA it is a safe drug. There are no such things as completely safe drugs. And what about the harmful, addictive drugs approved for use by the FDA? Many drugs that we take every day can have serious harmful or even fatal effects. Many can be abused. \n \n Do you know the real reason that street drugs are illegal in the first place?",

And if we do like other legal drugs, kids can only buy them at a certain age, and even then, warnings are printed on the label telling of the risks. \n\n \n This is pretty absurd. Go give the common high school drug user a sheet with factual information about drugs, and I can promise you that they are not going to be impressed. Most states require health classes and refresher courses that already drill into these kids' heads the truths about drugs.\n \n And even those who do them without knowing the truths about them...?\n \n Ask any one of those drug users why they do drugs, and 95% of the time the answer will be because \"they feel good\", or something to that extent. No amazing new education about drugs is going to get kids to stop doing it for that reason. Look at cigarettes. They have warning labels all over them, and they're the most common drug out there.

They leave caffiene on the market, along with alcohol, and perscribe ritalin (don't get me started there). yeah safe, whatever.\n \n Personally I don't want to be on the road if a heroin addict can't tell the difference between a red and green street light. \n \n Either they should legalize or illegalize them all.

   "Until recently, I didn't really see any problems with legalising drugs. But after I was made the intended car jacking victim of a guy who had a passion for drugs, I have come to realise that the danger in drug taking reaches far beyond the addict.\n \n The guy was virtually unstoppable. He could recklessly drive and crash a car, but even with injury, was absolutely focussed when it came to acquiring a new vehicle, whatever it took. He was motivated by the fact he was being chased by an army of gun wielding maniacs (which turned out to be a figment of his amphetamine mixed imagination). \n \n Now I realise making something illegal, doesn't necessarily prevent it from happening, but I don't think that any society can afford to send a message to it's citizens saying that inducing your mind into a completely uncontrollable state is acceptable behaviour (If it was in the privacy of your own cell, I might be inclined to agree). By legalising something, we are in effect saying that it's okay to try it... and unfortunately people are dangerously unpredictable when they take SOME illicit drugs and can't handle the result. The fact is, they are potentially harming other people, not just themselves.\n \n Perhaps we need to clarify which drugs we are considering legalising?",

Even if the government sold pot, people can grow better strains on their own for free. \n \n Draconis << it would reduce funding for terrorism. \n \n Terral's reply << How much funding do you believe that terrorism requires? Terrorists can steal whatever resources they need. Also, remember that the main components of the Oklahoma City bombing were fertilizer and fuel oil (source: http://www.holology.com/mcveigh.html ). The right amount of propane gas could have the same result. And just how much did those Saudi terrorists spend preparing for 9/11? Not much. Therefore, funding has little to do with the topic of terrorism. \n \n Draconis << it will lower suicide rates because now psychologists can prescribe drugs to treat serious mental illness that can be administered from the home, and are very cheap.\n \n Terral's reply << We would be far ahead today if we allowed private companies to handle our Social Security. Letting Government control the healthcare system would send prices off the charts. And people like myself would not be allowed to earn money by marketing medications. (two of my sites: www.gmedonline.com and www.canadamedsstore.com ).\n \n Draconis << legalizing drugs will eventually lead to safer more user-friendly ways to get high. Eliminating the addictive, harmful drugs currently on the streets. \n \n Terral's reply << What you are describing is available today in the form of Prozac, Valium, etc.. The illegal trafficking of drugs on American streets is not the result of supply side economics. It will continue to thrive so long as the demand for these drugs exists. Your larger government need not legalize the sale of pot to curb the illegal importation and sales in this country. They have only to allow citizens to grow for their own use. After all, we can find a thousand better uses for our money, than the housing, feeding, clothing and medicating of potheads of this country. \n \n God bless,\n \n Terral\n\n \n \n In Canada the government controls the health care sysmtem and about 9% of the Canadian GDP is spent on health care. If I am not mistaken 13% of US GDP is spent on healthcare. The marketting of medications is one of the reasons, have to pay the salespeople, have to pay for the advertising. All so people can get medications for problems they didnt even know they had.\n \n \n As for legalising drugs. \n \n Criminal gangs will be smaller and less powerful since most of the money they have is from illegal drugs.\n \n There will be fewer people in prison. A large percentage of the prison population is from drug related offences.\n \n Rehab facillities could be paid for from the taxes paid on the drugs.",

Q. Is Marijuana Addictive?\n A. No, it is not [8]. Most users are moderate consumers who smoke it socially to relax. We now know that 10% of our population have \"addictive personalities\" and they are neither more nor less likely to overindulge in cannabis than in anything else. On a relative scale, marijuana is less habit forming than either sugar or chocolate but more so than anchovies. Sociologists report a general pattern of marijuana use that peaks in the early adult years, followed by a period of levelling off and then a gradual reduction in use [9]. Q. Does Marijuana Lead to Crime and/or Hard Drugs?\n A. No [11]. The only crime most marijuana users commit is that they use marijuana. And, while many people who abuse dangerous drugs also smoke marijuana, the old \"stepping stone\" theory is now discredited, since virtually all of them started out \"using\" legal drugs like sugar, coffee, cigarettes, alcohol, etc.Q. How Does Marijuana Affect Your Health?\n A. Smoking anything is not healthy, but marijuana is less dangerous than tobacco and people smoke less of it at a time. This health risk can be avoided by eating the plant instead of smoking it [13], or can be reduced by smoking smaller amounts of stronger marijuana. There is no proof that marijuana causes serious health or sexual problems [14] but, like alcohol, its use by children or adolescents is discouraged.

Stealing is illegal, but people still do it. Should we just give in and say, \"Well everyone will do it no matter what the law is, so let's legalize everything\"? What about those who go to detox centers or drug treatment centers? Who will pay for that if homeless people need help? I sure as hell am not dishing out any money to them.\n \n \n \n \nFor a quick breakdown of associates of mine\n \n at least 80% have tried weed\n 40% cocaine\n 40% steriods\n 70% ectasy\n 60% acid\n 70% mushrooms\n \n As for health care costs associated with the above use, very minimal, two people have overdosed/ believed to have commited sucide.\n \n From the people above they have cost more to society with alcohol then the illegal drug use. Drunk driving, fights, and broken bones from doing drunken stupid things.\n \n Not that I am for unrestricted access to this drugs. especially the harder ones, but looking at Holland and the way drugs are treated their the costs to society seem to be less when legal but controlled then when illegal and uncontrolled.\n\n \n \n \n Once again, the phrase, \"Everyone does it, why can't I?\" is not a sensible or logical reason to legalize drugs. The government just can't give in to people because \"everybody does it\". What's next?",

Much in the same way alcohol was illegal in the 1920's, and made legal. Comparing making drugs legal to murder is a very poor argument.\n\n \n \n Cocaine is very addicting. And people who get addicted to it often will go to the end of the world to get money to buy more, oftentimes resorting to stealing. Note the case of the crack whore. She will sell herself to get money to buy crack. Stealing is a property crime. Ever watch Cops? They pull people over all the time who are high on drugs, driving on the wrong side of the road, driving 5 MPH, or driving in reverse. Does that not put people in danger? \n \n Now look at steroids. Ever heard of roid rage? People become violent. There was a case of a former Major League baseball player who beat his wife in a roid rage. Assault is not a property crime, but it is a crime directly associated with roid rage.\n \n I am not sure the effects of acid or mushrooms. But look at ecstacy. Whether it is legal or not, people will abuse it and use it to coerce girls into having sex with them. Making this legal will just make certain cases of rape involving ecstacy nearly unprosecutable. \n \n How can you not see the possible crimes committed by people on these drugs?",

   "The above group meant the people I know who have used drugs. Non have commited property crimes.\n \n Cocaine is addictive, but in general the level has alot to do with your personality, how often you do it overall much like alcohol. Crack, not having done it seems to be extremely addictive, which is why personally I would never touch it.\n \n Steriods, at the gym I go to at least 60% of the male members have used them. From what I have seen personally roid rage seems to be a fallacy. If you are violent before taking steriods, you are going to be violent with steriods. If you are nonviolent before steriods you are not going to be violent after steriods. I have a feeling the number of wife beating occur with men who are not on steriods.\n \n \n Ecstacy is a methampatamine, an upper if you will and makes people touchy feelly. It is not a date rape drug. Most males on it cant \"perform\", which is why viagra has become common when people take ecstacy. For the rape part of it I believe you are thinking of GHB and Rohipnol(sp). Both when combined with alcohol leave the woman in a passed out, or extremely drunk like state, which allows the man to rape them. Usually the woman did not willing take either, and yes this would be rape.\n \n Except for crack and heroin (of which I have no personall knowledge to make any statement) the other drugs listed by me seem to have no more of a determental effect on the users or society then overeating or alcohol.",

   "The above group meant the people I know who have used drugs. Non have commited property crimes.\n\n \n \n Haha!! Since when did taking a poll at work have anything to do with homeless people committing crimes? Nobody at my works has gotten a DUI or killed person, and many of them drink. Is it safe for me to assume the same is true to for all? No. Just because you know a few people who do drugs and haven't committed property crimes shows me nothing. I have seen plenty of people in person and on TV who have in fact committed crimes while on drugs. The key is they have a job, and seem to not be addicted to the drugs. People without jobs who are addicted resort to stealing to get drug money. Do you not see that?\n \n \n \nSteriods, at the gym I go to at least 60% of the male members have used them.

I have a feeling the number of wife beating occur with men who are not on steriods.\n\n \n \n I play baseball for a Division 1, top-25 baseball program. I know a lot of people, some who play ball and some who don't, that are on or have taken steroids. I have personally noticed a slight difference in their demeanor, but nothing major. Steroids also make people feel suicidal. I have read of numerous occasions where those on steroids have committed suicide. Once again, you give me some stats you took at a gym. That tells me nothing\n \n \n \nEcstacy is a methampatamine, an upper if you will and makes people touchy feelly. It is not a date rape drug.

   "I do see it, but I also see that with the criminalization of drugs, the prison population is soaring, due to from what I understand actual drug possession or selling of it. Criminal gangs get most of their money from drugs. People continue to use drugs even though they are illegal (like alcohol during the 20').\n \n By legalizing drugs and taxing them a few thing would probably happen\n \n 1. Prison pop would decrease, saving the government money, which could be used for drug rehab programs.\n 2. Extra revenue for the government by taxing the sale of drugs, which could be used for drug rehab programs.\n 3. Eliminating the most profitable source of income for criminal gangs.\n 4. Drug education will be more informative towards the effects of drugs, instead of \"drugs are bad mmkay\" which doesnt tell people anything.\n \n Will a few more people try drugs probably, will more crimes be commited probably not if rehab programs are more available and people are not afraid to use them for fear of being locked up. So that the homeless junkies will get treatment instead of being thrown on the street or locked up for a few months and still getting drugs in prison.",

   "If ALL drugs are not legalized, people will still get thrown in jail for drug offences (related to cocaine, heroin, etc.).\n \n It is not likely that gangs will suddenly not have money and the prisons will be empty by just legalizing marijuana. Gangs will sell other drugs and get sent to jail for those crimes.\n \n However, it seems to be a general concensus that legalizing hard drugs is not a good idea.\n \n Therefor, \"legalizing pot will decrease prison population and get rid of gangs\" is not a valid arguement.",
