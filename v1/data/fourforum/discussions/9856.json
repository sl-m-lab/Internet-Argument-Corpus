   "While publically the US govt. has largely focused on the \"axis of evil\", the other overt action taken since 9/11, aside from Afghanistan and Iraq, has been in Somalia, and the results aren't pretty.\n \n There's really too much recent history for me to go into, but to break it down into a few lines.\n \n 1) Somalia has no central government, but there is a fairly stable society of regional tribal and religious figureheads.\n \n 2) The US backs the installation of an unelected \"democratic government\" composed of some of these leaders. \n \n 3) Those not included in this government actively support resistance against it, and even many of those who are included also do, consequently they are unable to even enter the capital, and attempts to gain some kind of control result in military losses to local warlords allied with Islamic clerics. These forces take control of the capital, resulting in a minimalist Islamic government.\n \n 4) Ethiopian troops (I'm sorry, \"peacekeepers\") with US military hardware, and air support, and the guidance of special forces troops on the ground, invade somalia, driving the islamic/local forces out of there.\n \n At this point there are several hundred thousand refugees that have fled the country.\n \n The US has justified this intervention by claiming their intelligence showed Al Qaeda operatives there, and by comparing the islamic government there to the Taliban (neglecting to mention of course, that this islamic alliance only gained power in response to earlier US intervention). No evidence has been presented of these alleged Al Qaeda, and it seems to me that the situation that has been created there is only likely to create terrorism.\n \n Although the previous islamic government has been displaced, you now have a situation of armed and dispersed insurgency emulating the tactics employed in Iraq, locals resentful of the occupation are learning how to make bombs, and learning to hate America, with about 1000 dead, mostly civilians, in the last month. The largest clan in the capital has declared its opposition to the occupation, what can you hope to achieve through occupation with that reality?\n \n As the associated press puts it\n \n \nGovernment and Ethiopian troops last conducted an operation to flush the Shabab out of Mogadishu in late March. But when civilians were killed in the crossfire, secular clan militias joined the fight alongside the Shabab (islamic courts). Four days of battle killed more than 1,000 people, but made little difference, said residents and elders from the Hawiye clan, the largest in Mogadishu\n\n \n This recent fighting has also destroyed in a large part the future material prospects for the people living there, in this war for example, a local recently constructed Coca-Cola factory employing locals and producing clean bottled water has been looted, while the streets of the capital have been transformed into a battleground.\n \n To me its clear this intervention will accomplish nothing for the people there, is of extremely dubious merit in preventing future terrorism, and the best consequence the US can hope for is that it will be able to implement a stable puppet-government that lasts more than 6 months.\n \n Aside from the prosecution of this pointless war, the US has shown complete disregard for human rights, once again, interrogating \"terrorist suspects\" held without charge at its request in Ethiopia's dungeons.\n \n See http://www.chris-floyd.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1080&Itemid=135 for further details.",

The bottom line is the US and Ethopia are supporting the same government that the UN is supporting against the ICU, which imports foreign Jihadists to commit acts of terrorism against the opposition. The ICU is backed by the Eritrea who just finished a civil war against Ethopia. And recently, the ICU called for a Jihad against Ethopia. You need a scorecard to keep the players straight. :xbanghead",
