Gallup couches the questions in a way that favors spiritualism. That is his preference and I think that his polls are slanted that way. I don't think I have ever seen a poll that actually asked the question directly and \"no religion\" doesn't really ask it. The numbers are just guesses. I think Big Orn is correct 7 to 10% is probably a bit low.",

I'm sure in places like Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, and other southern states it is much lower among kids as well, but definately more than 10% of the people at my school is atheist (unless I just know all the atheists and every single other kid I know believes in God, but I don't think so :))",
