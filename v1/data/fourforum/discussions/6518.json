We have to stress that its wrong for men and women to hit each other. If we do not do this we will never help lower domestic violence. Its starts when kids are little. We always tell little boys not to hit little girls but we never tell little girls not to hit boys. Its almost comical when a girl hits a boy but its so hypocritical. This is not only harmful to young boys mentally its also potentially harmful to young girls in the future because they never learn the self control needed to recist hitting a man.",

They call themselves looking out for the child's best interests.\n \n We had a recently noted case where DFACS took an infant away from perfectly good parents because a court appointed doctor sent the wrong x-ray report and concluded that the family had been beating the child. Rather than take new x-rays as requested by the parents to prove their innocence, the court denied them for two years. The child was sent to a kin folk's home in another city. Some two years later, he had to have x-rays for something else and the parents were able to get them sent to the court here. The court and the DA are now \"looking into the previous allegations\" as it turns out the child had no evidence of any history of bone fracture as \"proved\" by the original report.",

I see all forms of domestic violence between parents, children, spouses, friends, lovers, neighbors, or any combination of the above. I have seen women stab men, shoot men, hit them with furniture or bricks, even light them on fire. I have seen the same from men. Domestic violence is blind to gender, race, or economic status. I think the perception that domestic violence is a male on female problem is brought about by the fact that men are more likely to cause serious injuries, and are arrested more often than not when both are probably guilty.

   "Oops, I guess I should say:\n \n Yim's!!! etc., etc. Or, in back-slang, s'Mij!!!!!\n \n But, from Wikipedia:\n \n Yobbo or yob is a slang term for an uncouth blue collar individual or thug. The word derives from a back-slang reading of the word \"boy\" (boy or boyo reversed becomes yob or - slightly modified - yobbo).\n \n In Britain, as the word 'yob' came out of the London back-slang and into more general English usage, it and latterly, 'yobbo' have meant 'working class, adolescent, male person'. Within his own culture, he was not necessarily seen as uncouth, though a person writing about him rather than speaking of him was likely to be of another social class and prone to seeing him as loutish.\n \n Dr. Onions of the Oxford English Dictionary seems not to have noticed the word before he published the XYZ section of the dictionary in 1921 but the later supplement notes the use of 'yob' as meaning 'boy' in the working-class youth context, from 1859. This implies that the word had by that stage, come out from the back-slang argot into ordinary English usage. In the dictionary supplement's references, it is possible to detect a slow drift in the word's meaning, towards the 'ruffian' interpretation, the new emphasis becoming clear from about 1927.\n \n 'Yobbo' appears from 1922 when its meaning does not clearly emphasize the ruffian. Its meaning drifts clearly towards the 'ruffian' interpretation by 1956, though a reference of 1938 calls a yobbo a 'street rough'.",
