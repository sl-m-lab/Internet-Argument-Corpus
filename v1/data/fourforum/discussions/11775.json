Cars that were not manufactured with them are still not required to have them. There are different emissions standards for them. You cannot just retrofit a cat to something...it boosts back pressure and on some older enignes that were designed to run will little backpressure it actually makes them run worse.\n \n You are only halfway correct about unleaded.

I think it's mostly hot air, and I don't think there's a chance of it in the near future, the aftermarket parts business, and private interest in old cars is just too big. Many if not most people, even those with no interest in cars, would agree that a government denial of ownership of something because of its age is as un-American as it gets. What would an 8 or 9 year old car be worth in a society like that? \n \n I saw a message board discussion a year or so ago that was talking about private owners soon being unable to buy car paint anymore. Safety and pollution of course, the reasons most liberties are threatened. That was an issue for me since I used to paint cars for a living, and enjoy occasionally painting one for myself or a friend. The shop where I've always bought my paint heard nothing about it, and later I saw where it looks like private owners will eventually have limits on how much paint they can buy. One or two gallons per year. I don't like it, but I'll be able to live with that. \n \n I don't think we'll see any more drastic measures than this, at least until after private ownership of guns is banned.",
