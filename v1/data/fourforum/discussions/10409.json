   "This post I'm just going to recite my thoughts. I'm sure this will nausiate most in here, but there might be someone out there interested. \n \n There is another explanation for life, beside the materialistic, scientific explanation. As a Creationist I realize materialists have taken every ounce of common sense, every logical idea and twisted it into something highly illogical, highly unbelievable and propped it up as \"fact\" under the cloak of \"science.\" In this post I'm going to try and reverse some of the damage they've done and restore some order and common sense.\n \n --------------------------------------------------\n \n When you sit back and look at this whole thing, the debate is so polar opposite it's almost eery. But I just thought I'd compare and contrast what I consider the most obvious difference in philosophy.\n \n Materialists: believe that lifeforms are evolving upwards from something ugly (bacteria, fungues, etc) by way of a purely physical mechanism...(no thought or intelligence required)\n \n SS: believes that we are devolving downwards from something beautiful (God) by way of the mind or mental processes.\n \n Materiatists: say genes get passed down through the generations.\n \n SS: says the mind gets passed down through the generations.\n \n Materialists: say the genes control the mind\n \n SS: says the mind controls the genes\n \n With this comparison, it is easy to see who the real competitors are: the competition is between the physical actions of genes and the mental/spiritual processes of the mind. It can be no other way. Either information gets squeezed out of the random actions of genes or it gets squeezed out of the purposeful processes of the mind. \n \n Evolutionists give the genome the credit for being the origin of information. I, on the otherhand acknowledge that the genome is a data base of information, but it's merely a storage device and does not act as a generator of information. I agree with Pierre Grasse's statement:\n \n \"But according to Darwinian doctrine and Crick's central dogma, DNA is not only the depository and distributor of the information but its SOLE CREATOR. I do not believe this to be true.\" Pierre Grasse \n \n \n And since physical, mechanical, random, unintelligent processes cannot account for information's source, then the only logical alternative is a non-physical, non-mechanical, non-random, intelligent reality -- ultimately God. But as creation is a spiritual reflection of God, all creatures are ultimatley designed reflecting God's spiritual qualities, starting with consciousnes, awareness, and ultimately information. Thus, information's source resides in our minds just as it resides in God's mind. Obviously different creatures were designed with different qualities, abilities and information.\n \n But ever since the fall, the mind (and information) has been degenerating and losing complexity. We've recently learned from J.C. Sanford that the genome is most definitely degenerating. See here, if not familiar with Dr. Sanford.\n \n http://www.amazon.com/Genetic-Entropy-Mystery-Genome-Sanford/dp/1599190028/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-2036682-8463154?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1190337930&sr=1-1\n \n We see proof of degeneration all around us with all the new crop of genetic diseases popping up. Society is certainly degenerating genetically...this fact alone dispells the notion that we're in the process of increasing in complexity, as darwinists insist...instead we're deteriorating, decreasing in complexity. But is the genome itself the source of degeneration? I would say not because I believe the mind and mental processes are in control of the genome...and if this is the case, then the spiritual MIND is ultimately what's degenerating, which makes the physical genome, which is just a physical manifestation of the mind, a follower of degeneration, not a leader. Likewise, with the emergence of new traits, the genome (the storage device) is not the leader, it's the follower. New traits don't come from a change in the genome, new traits come from a change in the mind. \n \n How is this possible? How is it possible that a change in the mind would result in a change of physical traits? Atheists like to envision a strawman version of God as being some sort of mysterious old man in the sky who occasionally drops in on us earthlings. Reality, however, is that we are living in HIS world -- His universe -- HIS creation. You've probably heard the song \"He's got the whole world in His hands.\" It might sound cheesy to some, but I think there's a great deal of truth in those lyrics. We are living in His reality, in His hands. Therefore, what seems impossible (mental processes quickly creating new, heritable physical traits) is entirely possible, entirely real, and entirely unexplainable -- as is life itself. \n \n And all this makes sense from a Biblical perspective. Remember how it was that Adam and Eve walked and talked in the Garden with God?..they evidently had daily conversations with him. But for Adam and Eve to be in God's presence they must have been a perfect spiritual creation....(God cannot be in the presense of imperfection.) So I believe Adam and Eve were probably created perfectly and designed to live forever....But then, sin entered world and everything changed. But it wasn't God who changed, man did. Sin separated man not only mentally/spiritually from God, but physically as well. \n \n This degeneration continues today and is getting worse. Not only is spiritual degeneration worsening, but so is physical degeneration....they're both tied together in an inexplicably inseparable way....and they've got nowhere else to go but down.",

I agree with Pierre Grasse's statement:\n \n\n \n Again you need to read Adami to understand that the genes (as they evolve) only serve to bind (ie retain) information about the environment and that only to the extent that genetic sequences reflect the environment is information present.

Long after the central dogma was falsified! }\n \n He is correct, do you have a date on that quote?. Complexity is a function of natural selection which allows random variants to bind information about the environment via an indirect feedback loop. And the central dogma only says that the flow of information is DNA-<RNA-<Protein. It says NOTHING AT ALL about the creation of the information in the genes and it is neither essential to NDS nor is it part of NDS itself. Basically you are barking up the wrong tree, prehaps even in the wrong forest. In addition molecular biology long ago (at least 30 years) discared the so called central dogma. Its 2007 not 1970.\n \n \nReverse transcriptase\n From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n Reverse Transcriptase\n \n 3D model of HIV reverse transcriptase\n Other names: Deoxynucleoside-triphosphate:\n DNA deoxynucleotidyltransferase (RNA-directed)\n \n * RNA-directed DNA polymerase\n * DNA nucleotidyltransferase (RNA-directed)\n * Revertase\n \n Database Links\n EC number: 2.7.7.49\n \n In biochemistry, a reverse transcriptase, also known as RNA-dependent DNA polymerase, is a DNA polymerase enzyme that transcribes single-stranded RNA into single-stranded DNA. Normal transcription involves the synthesis of RNA from DNA, hence reverse transcription is the reverse of this.\n \n Reverse transcriptase was discovered by Howard Temin at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and independently by David Baltimore in 1970. The two shared the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Renato Dulbecco for their discovery.\n \n Commonly used examples of reverse transcriptases include:\n \n * HIV-1 reverse transcriptase from the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (PDB 1HMV)\n * M-MLV reverse transcriptase from the Moloney murine leukemia virus\n * AMV reverse transcriptase from the avian myeloblastosis virus\n * Telomerase reverse transcriptase that maintains the telomeres of eukaryotic chromosomes\n \n \n \n [edit] Viruses\n \n The enzyme is encoded and used by reverse-transcribing viruses, which use the enzyme during the process of replication. Reverse-transcribing RNA viruses, such as retroviruses, use the enzyme to reverse-transcribe their RNA genomes into DNA, which is then integrated into the host genome and replicated along with it. Reverse-transcribing DNA viruses, such as the hepadnaviruses, transcribe their genomes into an RNA intermediate and then, using reverse transcriptase, back into DNA.\n \n [edit] Eukaryotes\n \n Self-replicating stretches of eukaryotic genomes known as retrotransposons utilise reverse transcriptase to move from one position in the genome to another via a RNA intermediate. They are found abundantly in the genomes of plants and animals. Telomerase is another reverse transcriptase found in many eukaryotes, including humans, which carries its own RNA template; this RNA is used as a template for DNA replication[1].\n \n [edit] Prokaryotes\n \n Reverse transcriptases are also found in bacterial retrons, distinct sequences which code for reverse transcriptase, and are used in the synthesis of msDNA.\n \n [edit] Structure\n \n Reverse transcriptase enzymes include an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase and a DNA-dependent DNA polymerase, which work together to perform transcription. In addition to the transcription function, retroviral reverse transcriptases have a domain belonging to the RNase H family which is vital to their replication.\n \n [edit] Replication fidelity\n \n Reverse transcriptase has a high error rate when transcribing RNA into DNA as unlike DNA polymerases it has no proofreading ability. This high error rate allows mutations to accumulate at an accelerated rate relative to proofread forms of replication. The commercially available reverse transcriptases produced by Promega are quoted by their manuals as having error rates in the range of 1 in 17,000 bases for AMV and 1 in 30,000 bases for M-MLV[2]\n",

Genes certainly do not, directly have any influence over thought processes.\n \n 3) What exactly do you mean by mind?\n \n \nthe competition is between the physical actions of genes and the mental/spiritual processes of the mind. It can be no other way. Either information gets squeezed out of the random actions of genes or it gets squeezed out of the purposeful processes of the mind.\n\n \n This makes no sense to me.

They are largely responsible for generating skin and eye colour in cold-blooded animals and are generated in the neural crest during embryonic development. Mature chromatophores are grouped into subclasses based on their colour (more properly \"hue\") under white light: xanthophores (yellow), erythrophores (red), iridophores (reflective / iridescent), leucophores (white), melanophores (black/brown) and cyanophores (blue). The term can also refer to coloured, membrane associated vesicles found in some forms of photosynthetic bacteria.\n \n Some species can rapidly change colour through mechanisms that translocate pigment and reorient reflective plates within chromatophores. This process, often used as a type of camouflage, is called physiological colour change. Cephalopods such as octopus have complex chromatophore organs controlled by muscles to achieve this, while vertebrates such as chameleons generate a similar effect by cell signaling. Such signals can be hormones or neurotransmitters and may be initiated by changes in mood, temperature, stress or visible changes in local environment.\n \n",

The volitional input of creatures absolutely does indirectly steer the course of their evolution.\n \n \nSS: believes that we are devolving downwards from something beautiful (God) by way of the mind or mental processes.\n\n \n That's both empirically wrong (oldest fossils are of much simpler organisms than exist today) and dreadfully depressing.\n \n \nMateriatists: say genes get passed down through the generations.\n\n \n And since this is inarguable, empirical fact, we're fairly safe in saying so :)\n \n \nMaterialists: say the genes control the mind\n\n \n Um, no, they don't. Genes can regulate the production of chemicals (empirical facty), chemicals can influence your mood (empirical fact) and your mood can influence your decisions (empirical fact). That's not the same as 'controlling the mind', that's just your physiology giving you hints whose usefulness has been empirically established over many generations. The fight-or-flight reflex, for instance.\n \n \nSS: says the mind controls the genes\n\n \n ...and provides no evidence in support of this assertion.\n \n \nAnd since physical, mechanical, random, unintelligent processes cannot account for information's source,\n\n \n Perhaps if you could make some headway towards defining 'information' we could see if that were true or not.\n \n \nBut ever since the fall, the mind (and information) has been degenerating and losing complexity. We've recently learned from J.C. Sanford that the genome is most definitely degenerating. See here, if not familiar with Dr. Sanford.\n\n \n EDIT: Sorry about that, confused two publications. I'll look into what Sanford has to say.\n \n \nWe see proof of degeneration all around us with all the new crop of genetic diseases popping up.\n\n \n With 6,000,000,000 or so of us around, the odds of such events happening to someone, somewhere, are much greater than they ever used to be. Plus, our ability to even diagnose such illnesses is relatively recent - how do you know they're 'new'?\n \n \nNew traits don't come from a change in the genome, new traits come from a change in the mind. \n\n \n Tell that to a genetically spliced organism.\n \n \nTherefore, what seems impossible (mental processes quickly creating new, heritable physical traits) is entirely possible, entirely real, and entirely unexplainable -- as is life itself. \n\n \n Certainly, if you invoke an all-powerful god, anything is possible. You can literally believe anything you like. That doesn't make you right, though. In fact, since the number of possible 'truths' opened up by the introduction of an omnipotent creator is essentially infinite, the odds of you picking the right one purely on faith are practically non-existent.\n \n By all means, choose to believe whatever you like. You can sit at home believing that the mind guides evolution, and that we're all inevitably devolving from perfection, and meanwhile scientists can get on with studying reality, making discoveries, finding cures for things - you know, the stuff they do - and at the end of the day we can compare whose 'philosophy' made the greatest contribution to humanity.",

Viable enucleated cells do not lie about like brain-dead lumps of cytoplasm on life-support systems. These cells actively ingest and metabolize food, maintain coordinated operation of their physiologic systems (respiration, digestion, excretion. motility, etc) retain an ability to communicate with other cells, and are able to engage in appropriate response to growth and protection-requiring environmental stimuli.\"  pg 65-66\n \n http://www.brucelipton.com/\n \n \"The new biology revealed that the brain of the cell is its skin, the mem-brane, the interface of the interior of the cell and the ever-changing world we live in. It is the functional element that controls life. This is important because understanding its function reveals that we are not victims of our genes. Through the action of the cell membrane we can actually control our genes, our biology and our life and we have been doing it all along although we have been laboring under the belief that we are victims.\n \n I started to realize that the cell was a chip and that the nucleus was a hard disk with programs. The genes were programs. As I was typing this on my computer one day I realized that my computer was like a cell. It had programs built into it but what was expressed by the computer was not determined by the programs. It was determined by the information that I, as the environment, was typing onto the keyboard. Suddenly all the pieces fell into place: the cell membrane is actually an information-processing computer chip. The cell's genes are the hard drive with all the potentials. That is why every cell in your body can form any kind of cell because every nucleus has all the genes that make up a human. But why should one cell be skin and another cell be bone or eye?\n \n The answer is not because of the gene programs but because of the feedback of information from the environment. All of a sudden the bigger thing hit me: what makes us different from each other is the presence of a set of unique identifying protein keys (receptors) comprising the keyboard on the surface of our cells. The identity keys on the cell membrane respond to environmental information. The biggest \"Aha!\" was this: that our identity is actually an environmental signal that is playing through the keyboard on the surface of our cells and engaging our genetic programs; you are not inside your cell, you are playing through your cell using the keyboard as an interface.

   "And while the creationists debate semantics and irrelevancies like spiritual control of organisms. The beat goes on where the real science and reasoning gets done. In the lab, in the clinics, in the hospital rooms eventaully. Genes may not be important but you know these are the best minds we have and they are putting together applications practical enough to start raising ethical issues! Thats the hallmark of something coming to fruition. {This post brought to your attention by the American Association of Evil and Stupid Darwinists and Geneticists}\n \n \n \ncience 21 September 2007:\n Vol. 317. no. 5845, p. 1687\n DOI: 10.1126/science.1147475\n \n Prev | Table of Contents | Next\n Policy Forum\n MEDICINE:\n The Future of Personal Genomics\n Amy L. McGuire,1* Mildred K. Cho,2 Sean E. McGuire,3 Timothy Caulfield4\n \n On 31 May 2007, James Watson was handed a miniature hard drive containing his personal genome sequence, which was subsequently uploaded onto publicly accessible databases. Craig Venter's personal genome was published a few months later (1). These projects represent research milestones. They also present an opportunity to examine the ethical, social, and clinical implications of personal genomics.\n \n Excitement over these projects has been tremendous. Many are willing to pay a hefty price to be next. Scientists predict that within 5 years DNA sequencing technologies will be affordable enough that personal genomics will be integrated into routine clinical care (2). Companies are responding by offering their services for ancestry tracing, forensics, nutritional advice, reproductive assistance, and even social networking. It will not be long before companies are able to offer a \"Facebook-like service centered around our genomes\" (3). The medical community needs to consider the ways in which routine generation of this information will affect our health system and how this information might be used outside the medical context.\n \n Despite limited treatment options for many genetic conditions, genetic testing has revolutionized the clinical management of patients for many disorders. Building on this history, companies and genetic testing laboratories have begun to develop technologies for genetic testing on a broader scale. For example, Baylor College of Medicine offers microarray analyses to evaluate a fetus for over 65 disorders or for genomic errors associated with autism or mental retardation (4).\n",
