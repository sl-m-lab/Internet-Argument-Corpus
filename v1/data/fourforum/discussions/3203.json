   "For the first time in literary history, a Chaldean American novelist emerges to portray the descendants of ancient Mesopotamia, now called Iraq, where literature, school, law a map of the world, and the idea of dividing time and space in multiples of 60 was first found. The forgotten people who invented writing, science and astronomy, the ancestors of modern day Iraq are presented here by Weam Namou through a deeply personal story based on true events. \n \n \n It's estimated that three million Arabs live in the US, the fastest growing group of immigrants. Yet, there are only two-dozen or so Middle Eastern authors who have written novels in English or whose work has been translated from Arabic. The Feminine Art is the first in a series of novels that will dispel some of the myths about Iraq, Middle Eastern women, and Islam. \n \n This novel's charm, humor and honesty have already touched the hearts of many. Its authenticity has helped people become better acquainted with each other's cultures. Anyone who wants to assist in stopping the destructive acts that have terrorized both the East and the West will also appreciate this non-violent, non-political, non-stereotypical story of the people of Iraq. \n Learn more at \n www.hermizpublishing.com",
