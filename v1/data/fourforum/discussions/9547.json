   "Thanks to JP for setting up the debate and ringside threads.\n \n \n marc opens with a predictable meaningless diatribe recounting a bit of science history. Here he begins what we see throughout his opening post (and, really, everywhere else on this site): unsupported assertions. Darwin's ideas become \"a thoughtful alternative to religion\" rather than a descriptive collection of hypotheses about the development of life on Earth. To say that Darwin, who was very religious at the time, set out ideas meant to be \"a thoughtful alternative to religion\" flies in the face of common sense. But then, common sense has never been a barrier to some people...\n \n He follows with four \"more things\" that allegedly make evolution and atheism identical, all of which are utterly absurd. Science necessarily makes no claims about metaphysical purpose or the existence of deities. (Additionally, we can all have a good laugh when marc refers to \"astrology,\" which I'm sure most atheists reject soundly.)\n \n marc moves on to talkorigins and misinterprets the phrase \"religious bigots.\" Bigotry is the unfounded prejudice against people of different persuasions, and the talkorigins author is clearly referring to people who have any bigotry based upon religion; nobody has claimed that there is no such thing as a bigoted atheist, but context makes it clear that the author isn't talking about atheists who are bigoted against.. atheists.\n marc continues with a citation about creationism's intellectual dishonesty. This is undeniably true; countless times, well-known creationists have continued to present misleading half-truths and blatant falsehoods, often even after having their \"mistakes\" openly revealed. (See Gish's Bullfrog Incident, Wells' Icons of Evolution, or -- hell -- just about any of marc's threads here on 4forums... Better yet, follow the link he gives to the Index of Creationist Claims.) The term PRATT exists for a reason.\n marc holds these \"examples\" as indicators of non-neutrality, and tries to hold this against the site and its authors. However, the site never claimed to be neutral; marc himself clearly explains that the site claims to support the \"mainstream scientific\" view, which is unequivocally pro-evolution. Science had rejected most aspects of the Christian creation story by the mid 1800s.\n \n Hilariously, marc then quotes a bit that clearly explains that evolution and atheism do not go hand in hand. marc's explanation? Window dressing. (Kind of like how the ACLU will defend a religious person's rights \"only to dispel belief that the ACLU is atheistic.\" No, wait, not \"kind of\"; we can say exactly like...) He does this again with Austin Cline's words; presenting contrary evidence, then explaining it away by appealing to a conspiracy. If we apply that same logic to marc's insistence that evolution is atheistic, doesn't that mean that it's really not atheistic? I could argue that evolution is a manifestly Christian belief as indicated by marc's insistence that it's not...\n \n marc goes on to ask why there seems to be much discussion about how atheism and evolution are not interdependent. marc's mere existence answers this question: some people really are delusional enough to believe that there is a giant, world-wide, atheistic conspiracy (being followed by billions of theists) to corrupt the world.\n \n marc transitions toward his closing by claiming -- again, without any real evidence or explanation -- that the atheism and evolution are dependent upon one another. As he has the burden of proof, stamping his foot and whinging loudly won't cut the mustard.\n \n One wonders why -- finally given the opportunity to formally debate the assertion that marc has been raving about for over a year -- his opening statement is so short and lacking. Frankly, there's so little substance in marc's opening post that there isn't much for Peeling to actively rebut. However, there is plenty of opportunity for presentation of counterexamples and reductions to absurdity. marc brought up Kenneth Miller; I think that Miller's desire to link evolution and Christianity would go a long way toward countering many of marc's specific arguments. If marc can claim that denying that evolution is atheistic actually makes it atheistic, what could he possibly say about Miller's or the Pope's saying that evolution is Catholic? Maybe in marc's backward-logic world, asserting a connection proves independence...\n \n marc still stands a chance if he can squirm enough by redefiniting either or both of the terms \"atheistic\" and \"evolution\" to such an absurd degree that any rebuttal fails. Presumably, Peeling will cut off any such attempt at the pass.",

   "Lonely in here LOL.\n \n Marc's last post was so predictable, and so typically frustrating, I'll be interested to see how Peeling handles it. \n \n There's absolutely nothing in it of any substance to actually respond too. It's all opinion and cherry picked quotes, which most often, if you read them carefully, actually contradict marc's position. \n \n On top of that, he dismisses all scientific evidence (actually, only that pertaining in any way to evolution as marc sees it) as being corrupt and tainted, and all scientists, regardless of nationality, creed, etc... as being corrupt, greedy, and unreliable - an incredibly arrogant and ignorant assertion. His entire argument boils down to poisoning of the well and an ad hominem on all scientists. It's ridiculous. \n \n As for demanding proof of theistic evolutionist, marc himself has been confronted by several on these forums, he just refuses to acknowledge it as they simply cannot exist according to his strict worldview. All the links and personal encounters in the world will not change that.\n \n All I can say is I'm glad I'm not in Peeling's position, I'm not a patient man.\n \n Waxy",

   "There's absolutely nothing in it of any substance to actually respond too. It's all opinion and cherry picked quotes, which most often, if you read them carefully, actually contradict marc's position.\n\n Yup. marc was given a golden opportunity to present a logical, coherent argument for the position he's been screaming from the rooftops for over a year, and all he's done with said opportunity is to use it as a simple soapbox to repeatedly assert -- still without logical argumentation -- the same thing over and over. Quoting people will prove nothing. Explaining that he cannot understand how a person can be a theistic evolutionist is not in any way an argument for the nonexistence of theistic evolutionists. (If marc wants to keep using quotes explaining the incompatibility of evolution and a literal interpretation of the Genesis account, Peeling would probably do well to reiterate that theism isn't restricted to Christianity; despite the fact that non-literal interpretations of the Pentateuch aren't uncommon, the burden is still upon marc to show that deism, polytheism, panentheism, etc., are all incompatible with evolution.)\n \n ETA: Peeling (and marc, for that matter) might also look around the ASA site, particularly at this explanation of compatibility given by Christian scientists (who accept evolution).\n \n What I had been hoping to see was some argument not about belief but about fact. That is, would evolution's being true necessarily mean that there is no supernatural being? Would the existence of a supernatural being preclude the possibility of evolution? Based on the wording of the resolution, this should be the actual topic, in my opinion. marc, of course, has no leg to stand on here, so he's probably avoiding it.\n \n Also note that marc started slow and has expressed satisfaction now that the wheels have really started turning. This is -- unfortunately -- a major drawback of the 5/4 post format: marc essentially made Peeling burn one of his four posts with generic argumentation in response to a substance-less opening post, and marc now -- two posts removed -- can introduce a slew of ideas. Debate isn't about running your opponent out of responses. It's about debate. We're not really seeing much here.",

   "Marc's problem is the resolution itself: \"Evolution is atheistic\". The resolution practically begs for the exception to raise his hand and say \"I am an evolutionist who believes in God.\" With that, the whole argument falls. I am a scientist. I deny that the world was created exactly as described in the book of Genesis, yet I hold firm to my Christian beliefs. According to Marc, I must either be a scientist or a Christian, but in fact, I need not make this choice. I may have faith in those things I cannot touch while trusting the scientific method to tell me things about that which I can touch. \n \n Faith and science are not substitutes for each other. Science deals in proof. If you could \"prove\" God, you would not have \"faith\" in God. One can have faith in God without sharing the literal belief in the infallibility of those mortals who made the old-testament translation.

   "T.Q", 
   "I can hardly bear to read Marc's posts. His stunning lack of reading comprehension and insistence on conspiracies is mind numbing.\n \n \nI&#8217;ve shown, and will continue to show, that there&#8217;s NO DISTICNTIVE LINE WHATSOEVER that separates a few of the most basic facts about evolution, to the most far-fetched, atheistic speculations about evolution.\n\n From what I've seen, he hasn't shown anything that can be considered to in any way support his position. So far, his most repeated line of evidence to support his assertion that evolution is atheistic is the insistence of numerous parties that evolution is not atheistic...\n \n \nThe word &#8220;evidence&#8221; is every bit as vague and broad as the word &#8220;evolution&#8221; &#8211; what is concluded as evidence for some is not accepted as evidence by others. Some evolutionists claim that origins are important for evolution, and that speculative study about naturalistic origins is part of evolution. \n \n talkorigins;\n Quote:6) Evolutionary theory was not proposed to account for the origins of living beings, only the process of change once life exists. However, many have thought that the theory of evolution logically requires a beginning of life, which is true. Of those, many have thought that a natural account of the origin of life is necessary, and some have proposed models which have borne up or not as research proceeds\n\n So, for evolution to occur, life must have existed. Some people prefer a naturalistic explanation for the origins of life and are proposing ideas as to how life might have began. This passage does not in any way, shape, or form mean what Marc thinks it does...\n \n \nThe neutral middle ground that&#8217;s implied by theistic evolution just isn&#8217;t there. If it was, there would be far more conflicts between atheism and theistic evolution than there actually are.\n\n And here is another old standby-Theistic evolutionists do not exist. They are either confused Christians who are losing their faith, or they are lying atheists. So, E. Mutz, Jo Bennett, which are you? Lost christians or lying atheists?\n \n \nTheistic evolutionists often claim that God would not lie to us through nature. But Christianity prominently includes a supernatural force that does lie; Satan.\n\n I'm not sure if I'm reading this right, but I think Marc just imbued Satan with the power of creation over God emoticon_confused \n \n \nI don't have to blur the distinction - evolutionists and atheists do that for me just fine. \n\n Another fall back. It's not that Marc is ignorant of the facts, it's that the rest of the world keeps moving the goal posts.\n \n \nI guess I shouldn&#8217;t call Michael Ruse a bulldog, he&#8217;s an atheist, and I find him to be far more honest and straightforward than Kenneth Miller, a Christian.\n\n One step forward, two back. Marc finally acknowledges that Miller is a christian, he just lies a lot (to support the atheists, I guess)\n \n \nIt&#8217;s such a popular word for mocking that atheists have included it in one of their favorite 3 letter designations, &#8220;E.A.C.&#8221; For &#8220;evil atheist conspiracy&#8221;.\n\n We (and by \"we\", I don't mean atheists. I mean science supporters) didn't dream up the idea, we just put a name to it. And I don't think it's an \"atheist\" term. I've only ever seen it on e vs c debate boards. Again, Marc demonstrates his \"Me against the world\" complex.\n \n \nThe slippery slope is very real.\n\n Classic fall back for an unsupportable position.\n \n \nBecause there is often no way to tell where the facts stop and the speculation starts - no way to tell who are the honest messengers. According to the link I referenced before, is it a fact that there are &#8220;No Answers In Genesis&#8221;? Is Dawkins book &#8220;The Blind Watchmaker&#8221; nothing but fact?\n\n Even though this isn't relevant to the debate in any way (what do pundits opinions have to do with science?), Peeling can quite handily do away with this point by simply stating that it is up to the individual to educate themselves, not blindly believe everything they hear/see. Or, just say \"What do pundits opinions have to do with science?\" :) \n \n \nEvolution makes such a seamless, unnoticable transition into other subjects that even evolutionists themselves sometimes don't notice it.\n\n Again, Marc's science illiteracy shines through. He still does not realize that all branches of science are interconnected.\n \n \nThere has been so much speculation for thousands of years that life could have possibly spontaneously generated from non life that no real attempt by Wikipedia is made to assign its origins to any one person. It mentions that Aristotle (from a few hundred years B.C.) knew that dirty hay generated mice, etc. Laughable by todays scientific standards, but not laughable at all by the hopes of atheists to find naturalistic origins.\n\n Another example of Marc's attempt to widen the argument to a ridiculous degree. Peeling should just dismiss this out of hand by stating (again...) that abiogenesis is related to evolutionary theory only by the fact that evolution acts on life, and life originated in some manner. It's another nice attempt at making evolution look absurd, but anyone with any knowledge whatsoever knows this isn't even in the same ballpark as abiogenesis. Hell, it's not even in the same country. This whole paragraph should be dismissed by peeling as out of the bounds of the debate.\n \n \nBut many evolutionist bulldogs can and do - Richard Dawkins, Carl Sagan, Edward O. Wilson, Stephen Jay Gould, many others. And saying that, implying that, is the one thing that makes them all well known and wealthy because millions of itching ears want to hear them say it. Something about evolution is always just around the corner in newspaper articles, television programs, magazines and books - evolution is constantly in the public eye, and the public takes notice. Not because the public is fascinated with microscopes, because the public is fascinated with evolutions impact on religion and politics. Common sense tell us that todays younger professionals have less positive interest in culture and values than generations past, and they're certainly not interested in using their science to express and promote values. But some of them like the idea of using science to get away from values.\n\n Again, what do people's opinions about a branch of science have to do with the science itself? Never mind the fact that the whole paragraph is his opinion, with no actual factual basis. Bah, this whole debate is just an excuse for Marc to promote his conspiracy theories and blame the fact that his view of an old book contradicts reality is responsible for anything and everything. Another paragraph for Peeling to dismiss.\n \n \nEvolutionists and atheists, who believe the universe is always increasing in organized complexity, generally have the mindset that we humans can improve our lot and bring about a heaven on earth.\n\n What?! Where did this come from. Again, Peeling can nail him on this-or dismiss it out of hand-again.\n \n \nThey almost always are politically, as I showed above. If order and complexity are increasing naturally, big government is in order. Those who have a financial interest in evolution, (teachers, college professors, researchers) make more money if government is bigger, as they are almost always paid somewhat indirectly by others, including others who may not like their theories. \n \n Also, Wikipedia biographies on Carl Sagan, Edward O. Wilson, others, show big government views on things like global warming, saving rainforests, population growth, etc.\n\n Marc runs back to old faithful-government conspiracy run by shadowy atheists who are trying to protect their vested interests. Which is money apparently, and anyone with a college education is in on it.\n \n \nI've already covered in past posts the political reasons for why they do that.\n\n Where? Peeling can call him on this, as Marc never did provide a good explanation. Basically his explanation was \"well, look at the trouble they had with Gallileo\" Uh, they didn't actually admit their error for about 350 years, so I don't think PR was really a concern with that.\n \n \nCreationism is doing the damage? Dawkins, Sagan, Wilson, Gould, Provine, Dennett, Crick, Ruse, the ACLU etc. are not? I suppose it depends on the opinion of the damage analyst - which side he thinks is instigating the death and glory feud. Which side has the most public exposure - says the most attention getting things - files the most lawsuits - has the most to lose financially etc.\n\n Heh, nail him on the \"most to lose financially\" bit Peeling. Who does bring the most lawsuits? Who does stand to lose the most financially? How many \"pro-christian\" lawsuits does the ACLU handle a year? How much money is spent on evolution research each year, and how much is given to churches?\n \n As I thought, this whole debate has been nothing but an excuse for Marc to trot out his conspiracy theories. Peeling's won just by showing that one religious person accepts evolution, never mind showing that vast majority of Christian organizations (and most other religions) accept it.\n \n Peelings wrap up should be pretty short and sweet- \"My opponent hasn't offered any support for his position. In fact, he even offered quotes from prominent scientists as well as atheists stating that evolution is secular, and not atheist in any way. The End\"",

   "Sadly, another typically lacking post by marc. Despite the fact that Peeling accurately summarized the fact that any alleged politicization of evolution necessarily has no relevance to whether evolution is atheistic, marc devotes much of his closing statement to this effect.\n He continues by accusing the scientific community of \"gimmicks\" and \"avoiding scrutiny by the public\" by placing peer review \"above direct appeals to the general public.\" Frankly, this is the correct thing to do. Nobody would suggest that we take a poll to determine where to make an incision during heart surgery or to determine whether a new drug is safe. We have groups of people with specialized education evaluate conclusions related to their specific field. To say that this makes the scientific community unreliable is asinine. No doubt marc goes to a real medical doctor and relies on trained professionals instead of pulling random people off the street and asking for help with whichever subject is on his mind; marc's position is so absurd, even he doesn't agree with it.\n \n It is interesting to note that marc devoted a significant portion of his relatively short closing to Dembski's Universal Probability Bound, completely ignoring Peeling's quick but satisfactory dispatching of it. He also implies that Peeling cowered from abiogenesis, when there should be no doubt -- because marc has been told countless times on this forum alone -- that evolution is independent of abiogenesis. In reality, Peeling pointed out in his second post that abiogenesis is beyond the scope of evolution.\n \n I would also like to expand on a point that was painfully obvious yet probably should have gotten more discussion. marc repeatedly refers to claims that evolution is not atheistic as proof that atheism is atheistic. Let's look at all the possible claims:\n a) It is claimed that evolution is not atheistic -- marc says that this is evidence that evolution is really atheistic.\n b) It is claimed that evolution is atheistic -- in which case marc would say that this is evidence that evolution is really atheistic.\n c) There could be no claims either way about the theological implications of evolution -- in which case, one could speculate, marc would argue that the silence is an indicator of guilt (or at least non-denial), i.e. that evolution is atheistic. While this was not explicitly covered, I would guess that few if any posters who are familiar with marc's claims would disagree with this speculation.\n So, no matter the claim, marc draws the conclusion that atheism is atheistic. This renders this aspect of his argument completely moot; if it explains anything, it explains nothing.\n For this reason (among others) I find myself unable to agree with Peeling's retraction of his labeling of marc's views as conspiracy theorizing. marc is forced to call self-professed Lutheran, Republican judges anti-Christian activists and label Catholics as phonies.\n \n Other than repeating his assertion ad nauseam, marc never actually proved any point. Peeling should be found the victor if for no other reason than the point I made earlier here in this Ringside thread:What I had been hoping to see was some argument not about belief but about fact. That is, would evolution's being true necessarily mean that there is no supernatural being? Would the existence of a supernatural being preclude the possibility of evolution? Based on the wording of the resolution, this should be the actual topic, in my opinion.\nAlthough it is certainly relevant to note that theists have no problem reconciling evolution with their religion, there should be no doubt that even widespread beliefs can be incorrect. In this sense, marc is right: the mere existence, per se, of theistic evolution doesn't exactly close the door on the debate. (It's just a swift kick to the head.) The bottom line is that we saw no reasonable argumentation about actual fact of evolution being necessarily godless. His only attempt (that doesn't appeal to politics outright) is to show that evolution contradicts a literalist interpretation of his preferred creation myth; this is not showing that evolution is atheistic, nor does it even suggest that evolution is necessarily atheistic.\n \n As marc has completely failed to support the resolution -- in any form -- Peeling wins by default.",

   "First, I would like to thank both Marc9000 and Peeling for this interesting, albeit, extensive debate.

I would, for the future, try to establish word limits for posts and encourage the participants to debate shorter, more concise points. At times, the debate meandered off into unfocused areas that were tangent to the resolution at best. This had a tendency to dilute the salient points that were made. Sometimes, the trees got lost for the forest.\n\n I would like to reintroduce my suggestion for a defined \"scope of the debate\" precisely to prevent this sort of thing.

   "First, there is a \"scope of debate\".

As you pointed out yourself, even marc didn't know what he meant when he was talking about \"evolution.\" The same can be said for marc's meaning of \"atheism,\" which -- again, judging by his past posts -- includes not only strong atheists but also agnostics, all scientists, and even Catholics. When marc says that \"evolution is atheistic,\" we don't know if he means that evolution necessarily precludes the existence of a deity, or that the process of evolution promotes atheism, or that belief in evolution begets atheism, or that aliens have landed at the Pentagon. (Now apply all the permutations of his definitions.) As you can see if you check the proposal thread, nobody knew what in the f***ing hell marc actually wanted to debate. (Hell, nobody knew even after his opening statement.) marc tried very hard to avoid clarification so that -- in my opinion -- he could spew the wide spattering of anti-evolution claptrap from his debate soapbox.

You have said repeatedly (if memory serves) that debate is a type of sport. While I can see the merit of that approach, I see much more merit in approaching debate as a means of presenting relevant argumentation in order to support one's position to the point of convincing spectators (or the opponent) of that position in a valid manner. That is, while tactics like lying and fallacious reasoning that go uncalled may be beneficial for \"sport\" debating, they are completely out of place in an honest interpretation of facts. Sending my opponent diving down the rabbit hole in chase of some deception on my part does not further the education process and -- while perhaps an indicator of my opponents' lack of expertise on the subject in that s/he can't tell the difference between substance and fluff -- does not actually support my point.\n I'd rather debate a point because I believe it and can factually support my belief than because I can con my opponent into failing to win. That is to say, people should base their beliefs on reality, so let's talk about what is real. If I can win a debate as the affirmant for the resolution \"the earth is flat\" by distracting my opponent completely, then I've only shown that my opponent is a numbskull and not that the earth is really flat.

   "I didn't get a chance to post my final thanks to all involved in the thread proper, so I'll do it here instead.\n \n I agree with the judges' assessment that the debate ought to have been more focused. I think blame for its sprawling character can be more or less evenly apportioned:\n \n I felt the opening post didn't give much indication of which direction Marc wanted to take his arguments, being a general intimation that evolution... or maybe the theory of evolution... or maybe evolutionists... were 'quite like' atheism... or atheists... or something...meanwhile, here are some atheists saying evolution isn't atheistic :) I had the horrible feeling I was going to end up playing whack-a-mole; making a series of fragmented rebuttals that, stacked atop one another would appear weak and apologetic in the face of the 'general picture' marc was about to paint. In an effort to draw my own coherent alternative picture of the situation I went totally overboard and piled everything I could think of into my first post.\n \n As for chasing off after red herrings - yep, my bad again. In my defence, I didn't really know how well Marc's avowed intention to prove the resolution 'in a general way' had gone down with the judges, so I couldn't be sure whether simply stating 'that's beyond the scope of this resolution' would wash, or if I would end up leaving a whole bunch of valid points unanswered.\n \n The wording of the resolution was, ultimately, the main culprit and something we both agreed to. I think this debate should probably be stickied as an cautionary example of what happens when a resolution is insufficiently specific. A series of debates, eg: \n \n Evolution is Atheistic 1: Evolution is Compatible with Theism\n Evolution is Atheistic 2: Teaching Evolution Undermines Morality\n Evolution is Atheistic 3: Evolution Politically Favours Atheism\n \n and so forth, perhaps with alternating affirmative and negative roles, would probably have kept word counts within the realm of sanity and, ultimately, yielded a finer-grained result than what we have before us now. For instance, I think that evolution certainly is being pushed as atheistic, by atheists and fundamentalist Christians alike - the former in an attempt to sway those who consider themselves intellectuals and the latter in an emotive attempt to make the enemy of their enemy their friend: a drawing up of battle-lines. There certainly seems to be a degree of black apocalyptic glee in the po-faced declaration of irreconcilable differences on both sides.",

And that's precisely what happened.\n\n \n Much of that was within the scope of the debate. If you agree to the definition of \"religon\", \"athiesm\", \"evolution\", atc... BEFORE the debate, there is little or nothing to debate. A significant part of this debate was composed of the participants unwinding, over the course of the debate, what those terms mean and how they should be understood. \n \n Ultimatly what this debate boiled down to was a logical contest over what those terms should mean and how they should be construed. Ultimatly what debate boils down to every time is an argument over perceptions and which parties perception of a resolution passes the test of logic.\n \n \nApparently our disagreement here lies in our differing views of exactly what debates are (or should be). You have said repeatedly (if memory serves) that debate is a type of sport. While I can see the merit of that approach, I see much more merit in approaching debate as a means of presenting relevant argumentation in order to support one's position to the point of convincing spectators (or the opponent) of that position in a valid manner.

That's not a debate; that's a circus, and we already have too much of those kinds of attempts in the regular fora. I say let's hold the formal debates to a higher standard.\n\n \n \n Debate has been called (and I think rightly so) \"football for the mind\". It is an exercise in logic. No more, no less. Too many people want to step into the formal debate ring and use it to determine whose argument is \"right\". That cannot possibly be done in a formal debate, and I am sure as hell not qualified to judge who is \"right\" and who is \"wrong\". The judges job is to dissect the debate and determine whose argument is logical. No more, no less. And it is worth it to note that what is logical is not always right, and what is illogical is not always wrong (*though usually it is). \n \n When I was in debate, we had \"practice\" resolutions that we used to hone skills. One of those was \"Resolved: Aliens have invaded the earthe and are secretly directing all human activity\". I had to figh thte affirmitive on that one, and I WON. That was a big deal (to me) because it was the first time in the teachers 34 years of teaching debate that anybody had ever won on the affirmative. I still see her occasionally, and to this day she is shocked that I did not become a poltiician. \n \n I think that allowing use of devices like red herrings is important simply because we see them every day in life. You see politicians use them, you see them in business disputes...I have even seen my wife toss out a red herring when we were arguing (arguing about whether or not I needed a new VMC for my home shop and she tossed out \"you never do the laundry\"). It is one of the most common devices you see used in everyday disagreements, so it is important to be able to identify and avoid it. I think a lot of people actually use red herring tactics without realizing it.\n \n It seems like here, most people aregue what they really believe, not just a position that they are assinged on a resolution that was pickeed by strangers. It seems to me that under those circumstances, part of the point of debate is to LEARN something, and learning not to go off chasing some idiotic side point is, IMO, important.",

   "Thanks for the concern Marc!:) I know its alot of reading, but I'am going to start by quoting the points that I found intreasting when I first started reading the debate, until I catch up with the last couple of pages.\n \n To get started I'm going to quote Marc.\n \n [Marc] They both equally oppose exploration of the concept of intelligent design.[Marc]\n \n And Pelling's argument was,\n \n [Pelling] Marc takes the sturdiness of his foundations absolutly for granted, and makes no attempt to prove this philosophical alignment. This is based upon his implicit assumption of a link between atheism, and a pursuit of the scientific method. The asssumption gose thus: Since the theroy of evolution is arrived at by the scientific method, and the scientific method excludes the possibility of the supernatural, the scientific method, and therefore the TOE are atheistic.[Peeling]\n \n Now here is my view. How can a person say that something excludes the possibility of something else, and state that it dose not mean that they are denying it?! Now, the scientific method in a varity of ways excludes the fact that there was a creator. Thus making it atheistic. How?! Because they try to find ways of proving that the earth evolved by itself, and they test theory after theory, to try and make it fit, as if a puzzle. When you think about alot of the theories that science has come up with, it has not once really given any acknowledgement of a creator. Scientific methods, deal with the fact that science can accomplish anything, even the evolution of life itself. That sounds rather atheistic to me.\n \n And don't think that saying that churches believe in the scientific method means the science cannot be atheistic. Because that only shows that the churches are contridicting themselves. Which dose not bring a positive light on whether science is atheistic or not.\n \n I have to get back to work.
