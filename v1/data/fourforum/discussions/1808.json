   "Exodus 22:2-3 tells us \"If the thief is found breaking in, and he is struck so that he dies, there shall be no guilt for his bloodshed. If the sun has risen on him, there shall be guilt for his bloodshed. He should make full restitution; if he has nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.\" \n \n In Proverbs 25:26 we read that \"A righteous man who falters before the wicked is like a murky spring and a polluted well.\" Certainly, we would be faltering before the wicked if we chose to be unarmed and unable to resist an assailant who might be threatening our life. In other words, we have no right to hand over our life which is a gift from God to the unrighteous. It is a serious mistake to equate a civilized society with one in which the decent people are doormats for the evil to trample on. \n \n Timothy 5:8 tells us \"But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.\" \n \n King David wrote in Psalm 46:1 that God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. This did not conflict with praising the God \"Who trains my hands for war and my fingers for battle\" (Psalm 144:1). \n \n Romans 13:4, \"is God's minister to you for good. But if you do evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is God's minister, an avenger to execute wrath on him who practices evil.\" \n \n We must also consider what Christ told his disciples in his last hours with them: \"...But now, he who has a money bag, let him take it, and likewise a sack; and he who has no sword, let him sell his garment and buy one\" (Luke 22:36). \n \n \n \n Is that really the best you can do? COME ON crank up that grey stuff btwn your ears!!",

Jesus told him to put his sword away and said that \"all who draw the sword will die by the sword.\" (Matthew 26:52)\n \n Remember that statement the next time you take out your gun.\n\n \n \n \nWe must also consider what Christ told his disciples in his last hours with them: \"...But now, he who has a money bag, let him take it, and likewise a sack; and he who has no sword, let him sell his garment and buy one\" (Luke 22:36). \n \n \n \n By taking those two statements, both by jesus, we must conclude that Jesus was very much in favor of the use of weapons, even going so far as to say that even if it meant going naked, you should be armed. OF course, we must therefore also assume that Jesus, who wished people to be armed as clearly ststed above, also clearly wished for a lot of people to die by the sword. This would lead us to believe that jesus was some kind of drooling idiot who couldn't rememebr what he said earlier that same day.\n \n It is far more likely that since \"while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people\" (matthew 26:47, KJV), and jesus and his 12 deciple (11, since judas was on the other side) were apparently heavily outnumbered by this \"great multitude\", the statement by jesus was in direct response to the current situation and NOT a general policy statement.\n \n It would be akin to a group of 12 bank robbers looking out the window at a 200 armed cops and the leader saying \"We don't have a chance. Lets throw out our guns and surrender\".\n \n Funny how sometimes the meaning of things changes when you take them in context, is't it?",
