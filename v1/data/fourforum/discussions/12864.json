   "Think not that I come to send peace on earth: I came not to send\n peace, but a sword.\n - Matthew 10:34\n \n ... all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.\n - Matthew 26:52\n\n Matthew 10:34 doesn't speak of physical violence if you read the context. He would cause strife (whether that led to violence, He didn't elaborate) among family members, friends, etc, because some would believe in Him, others would not. The sword in this passage is metaphorical, even Micah 6:7 which He quoted isn't talking about a battle but a righteous man living in a fallen world. Matthew 26:52 is addressing specific physical violence, because Peter really did cut off someone's ear with a sword, and Jesus healed the wound.\n \n \nFor wrath killeth the foolish man...\n - Job 5:2\n \n ... let not the sun go down on your wrath.\n - Ephesians 4:26\n\n Yes Job rightly said wrath/anger kills, Paul knew this too which is why he exhorted the church at Ephesus to not go to sleep without first forgiving those who wronged them and sorting it out, thereby relieving themselves of the dangers of wrath and anger before the sun set. Paul says don't be a fool, talk it over and resolve it before it does kill you.\n \n \n And no man hath ascended up to heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.\n - John 3:13\n \n ... and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.\n - 2 Kings 2:11\n\n Yes it's quite John's point that nobody had ascended into heaven on his own power even Jesus, who received His power from His Father. Elijah was taken (not under his own power) into heaven by God which is clear in 2 Kings 2:1,3,5, and 10. Similarly Enoch was taken by God (Genesis 5:24). They didn't sprout wings and fly up there, God brought them there. \n \n \n If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.\n - John 5:31\n \n I am one that bear witness of myself...\n - John 8:18\n [Jesus was the speaker in both of these quotes]\n\n You forgot to fully quote John 8:18. here is the rest: and the Father that sent Me beareth witness of Me. He isn't bearing witness to Himself here. Two witnesses are, one of which is Himself, which is why He said in John 8:17 It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true. John 5:30-32 is saying this exact same thing. \n \n \nA good man leaveth an inheritance to his children's children...\n - Proverbs 13:22\n \n Sell that ye have and give alms...\n - Luke 12:33 \n\n And what is an inheritance? Proverbs 13:13 he who feareth the commandment shall be rewarded. 14 The law of the wise is a fountain of life. 15 Good understanding giveth favor 16 Every prudent man dealeth with knowledge 17 a faithful ambassador is health 18 but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured. 19 The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul 20 He that walketh with wise men shall be wise 21 but to the righteous good shall be paid. What inheritance should a good man leave to his children's children? Solomon wasn't talking of money, but of God's law. In Solomon's view, the wicked can have their money, the true reward goes to the righteous. Why this should contrast with selling your luxuries and giving to the poor I'm not sure. \n \n \n Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord... Wealth and riches\n shall be in his house...\n - Psalms 112:1-3\n \n It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than\n for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.\n - Matthew 19:24\n\n He also during his ministry made it pretty clear it was difficult for any man to go to heaven. Matthew 7:13-14 Enter ye in at the straight gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: Because straight is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it. Moreover Psalm 112 is backing up what Jesus asked the rich man to do if you read on. Verse 5 :A good man showeth favour, and lendeth verse 9, He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor, Jesus asked the rich man to disperse his funds and give unto the poor (as Psalm 112 says a righteous man will do) and to follow Him, and the man went away sad, provoking Jesus' response. Can't serve God, and money.\n \n \nI and my father are one.\n - John 10:30\n \n ... I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.\n - John 14:28\n [Jesus was the speaker in both of these quotes]\n\n Ezekial 37:22 And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall no more be two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all. So two nations can become one, yet be ruled over by a king. What's the problem with Jesus and His Father being one, and His Father being greater than Him? The concept of being one doesn't by default mean they're identical. I might become one with anyone by speaking out for the same issue. It could be said we spoke with one voice. Well the voices weren't identical, the point is that they spoke the same thing. Furthermore, if I speak with a group of people with one voice regarding an issue, one of those voices probably gathered us all together to speak as one. I suppose that voice would be the leader. \n \n \nThou shalt not kill\n - Exodus 20:13\n \n Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his\n side... and slay every man his brother...\n - Exodus 32:27\n\n By building a golden calf and worshipping it they defied Exodus 20:1-6. The penalty of which was established as death in Exodus 22:20 (10 chapters before these people were slain for it). Forewarned is forearmed.\n \n \nRemember the sabbath day to keep it holy.\n - Exodus 20:8\n \n The new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot\n away with: it is iniquity.\n - Isaiah 3:22\n\n If Isaiah 1:13 was quoted in entirety you would see the reason. Bring no more vain oblations.... So what's the issue? They were bringing offerings that were unsatisfactory (i.e. animals that had defects, and keeping good ones for themselves) and in doing so ticking God off. This is what Malachi 1:6-8 speaks of: saith the Lord of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise My Name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised Thy Name? Ye offer polluted bread upon Mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted Thee? In that ye say, The table of the Lord is contemptible. And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? If we gathered for the 4th of July and burned American flags, I'm sure more than one person would be angered and say the 4th has been desecrated as well. By doing the exact opposite as He had instructed, and calling it good, they profaned His holy days, and He called it as He saw it.\n \n \nThou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness\n of anything that is in heaven... earth... [or] water.\n - Leviticus 26:11\n \n And thou shalt make two cherubims of gold, of beaten work shalt\n thou make them.\n - Exodus 25:18\n \n They didn't make the cherubims unto (themselves), as Leviticus 26:1 clearly says nor bow down and worship them- they made them by God's command so that His Presence could rest between them on the ark. Then the ark was to be hidden away in a room, which only 1 man could enter during only 1 day of the year, and otherwise was not seen unless the ark was being moved. You'd be better served mentioning the brazen serpent which isn't so neat and tidy.\n \n \nFor by grace are ye saved through faith... not of works.\n - Ephesians 2:8-9\n \n Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by\n faith only.\n - James 2:24\n\n Paul continued in Ephesians 2:10 to say For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. James was saying works justified you in the eyes of humans- it proves your faith. He cited Abraham and argued Seest how faith was wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect? James 2:22, and faith without the works to show you have it is dead- in James 2:26. I don't see the issue, they say the same thing in different words. Paul said much the same in his epistle to the Galatians. Citing Abraham Paul showed the covenant made by God with Abraham was based on belief, and the idea of just following the later law of Moses would save you without faith is ludicrous. Moses did not supercede Abraham. We are justified (declared righteous) by faith, and we know we have faith by doing the works of God (being sanctified by following God as opposed to our own desires), exemplified by Jesus. Which is also spot on regarding the epistle to the Romans.\n \n \nGod is not a man, that he should lie: neither the son of man,\n that he should repent.\n - Numbers 23:19\n \n And the Lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his\n people.\n - Exodus 32:14\n\n In Exodus 32:7-14 God is having a conversation with Moses. He is giving him a chance to intercede for his people as Jesus now intercedes for those that believe in Him. This was the job of many prophets including Jonah, who ironically failed while Nineveh itself repented, thus sparing the city. If we call upon God's mercies and turn from evil to walk in His Ways, He will turn away the destruction we deserve. God \"repented\" because Moses called upon His mercy, and pointed out that the destruction of the nation was contrary to His Word to the fathers of the nation. The Bible admits there's a contradiction! Moses stepped in and called God's hand, even though Moses probly wanted rid of the nation, he never wanted the job, later he was forbidden to enter the Promised Land because he was so angry with them he disobeyed God's command in the sight of the nation. So Moses, denying himself, instead had compassion for a people he didn't like (and in many cases the feeling was mutual), became a model for the Messiah that would come and die for sins He didn't commit on behalf of a world that shunned Him. God now had record of what He planned to do in the future regarding the Messiah. As for that moment, the nation itself was spared, those that incited the rebellion were not spared, showing while God did turn from obliterating the whole nation save for Moses, He did not turn from visiting His anger on the instigators. This may seem foreign if you think the Bible is a fable, but the concept is found throughout the Bible from Abraham throughout the New Testament. I can't see how an example of intercessory prayer turning away God's wrath is a discrepency if you're using the Bible itself as the measure of it being false. I should think a better way to utilize Numbers 23:19 if you want to disprove the Bible using the Bible is by contrasting it with 2 Chronicles 18:18-24. While I believe the Bible to be true I can't figure that one, yet. :) Any thoughts?\n \n \n... the hour is coming, in which all that are in the graves shall\n hear his voice, and come forth...\n - John 5:28-29\n \n As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth\n down to the grave shall come up no more.\n - Job 7:9\n\n Good old Job spoke in his own wisdom, depression, and agony. If you read chapters 38-42, God answered Job's and his 3 friends' wisdom- in effect saying, \"How do you know anything? Have you created everything, do you make the universe work?\" He rebuked Job for his ramblings but considered Job righteous because he did not curse God throughout his affliction. Even if Job himself didn't believe in or know of the resurrection, was that relevant to the book of Job and by extention the Bible? Even if you contend it is, in chapters 38-42, God set Job straight on many things he earlier spoke of in his own wisdom. And Job himself saw and accepted and considered himself corrected. Jesus always spoke of resurrection mirroring the Old Testament prophets, never were they rebuked by God for it. \n \n \n... thou shalt give life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth,\n hand for hand, foot for foot, burning for burning, wound for\n wound, stripe for stripe.\n - Exodus 21:23-25\n \n ... resist not evil; but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right\n cheek, turn to him the other also.\n - Matthew 5:39\n\n Life was always taken for life, and it's pretty clear you couldn't turn a cheek if you were dead. As for the rest nowhere in Jewish law was an eye taken for an eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand etc. It was understood to mean that if your negligence or crime caused harm to another you were to either monetarily reimburse the victim, or if you couldn't pay you were to take care of the victim- i.e. if you caused blindness you just became their seeing eye dog. Which isn't all that different from American law in dealing with those same matters. He appealled to His followers to not just seek the letter of the law of Moses but also the spirit of it, which can be summed up in 2 sentences. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and mind and soul, and love your neighbor as yourself. If you'd like to take yourself to court and sue yourself, then you can consider doing so to your neighbor.\n \n \nHonor thy father and mother.\n - Exodus 20:12\n \n If any man come to me, and hate not his father and mother, and\n wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own\n life also, he cannot be my disciple.\n - Luke 14:26\n\n This would make sense to disprove the Exodus quote had He not said hate your own life as well. Mostly when we talk back and curse our family we do so out of selfishness. But Jesus said clearly hate your own life (don't be selfish). Did His followers commit suicide (excepting Judas)? Did they torment their families? No, instead they put the word of God above even their families and their own lives. It was a matter of setting priorities straight rather than telling His followers to act wickedly to their families. \n \n \nLay not up for yourself treasures upon the earth...\n - Matthew 6:19\n \n In the house of the righteous is much treasure...\n - Proverbs 15:6\n\n \"In the house of the righteous is much treasure\" isn't talking about his/her cash, car, and toys. It's referring to his/her family following the ways of righteousness. Which is contextually evident in Proverbs 15. Matthew 6 Jesus supports all of Proverbs 15 by exhorting the listener to serve God first above any material gain. He didn't say burn every material thing but to serve God first and fully before you go get all the toys of life.\n \n -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n P.S.- sorry Zardoz for not living up to the fundy response time rule.:) I'm low on the Jimmy Jones Kool Aid fix (TM) lately, its strawberry flavor week and I hate the taste.:)\n \n Although seriously, I am interested to know what those that don't believe in the Bible think about why these the contradictions exist. Is it A) that Judeo/Christians want to stroke their consciences and talk themselves into heaven, and/or wanted to dominate the masses, robbing them blind and killing a bunch of people here and there, in which case it would have been a relatively simple matter in antiquity to back track and just erase all the stuff that didnt plug into their theology, burn the untainted documents along with their followers and save themselves a lot of criticism. B) they were just too stupid to notice. Or C) that they truely did consider it holy writ and copied errors and all, reasoning that because they didn't have the evidence to figure it all out it didn't mean it didn't happen, or that it was a worthless document. Frankly, the Bible doesn't stroke the conscience it's a 6000 year old running indictment of the sins of mankind. The other cultures we know existed during the times it was written, and that we have tablets/documents from wouldn't have thought twice about deleting things that embarrassed themselves, and adding what made them look good. Hell, both liberal and conservative revisionists attempt to distort American history to prove they are right as we type- in the information age. My question is then, why do you suppose the Judeo/Christian Bible (but not neccessarily the adherents to it, of course) defies this trend? If it had no contradictions in it, would you consider this a stamp of authenticity?",

Amen.\n Rom 1:26 For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural,\n Rom 1:27 and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error.\n Rom 1:28 And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not proper,\n Rom 1:29 being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, evil; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice; {they are} gossips,\n Rom 1:30 slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents,\n Rom 1:31 without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful;\n Rom 1:32 and although they know the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, they not only do the same, but also give hearty approval to those who practice them.\n \n ====================================================================================================\n \n Jhn 8:42  Jesus said to them, \"If God were your Father, you would love Me, for I proceeded forth and have come from God, for I have not even come on My own initiative, but He sent Me.\n Jhn 8:43 \"Why do you not understand what I am saying? {It is} because you cannot hear My word.\n Jhn 8:44 \"You are of {your} father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him.

If you'd only have accepted the truth of the undying and never changing word of God, then you'd understand.\n You just gottsta believe first.\n It's as simple as that.\n But, no, you go right on hating God and you'll soon see where that will get you.\n BURNING IN HELL!!!\n \n Hahahah, FOOL!\n You are soo going to roast. In pain. FOR EVER!\n \n But, that's not my words.\n That's Gods!\n \n Me?\n I love you.\n I love you long time.\n Like forever even.\n If only you'd accept Jesus into your heart.\n \n Cause if you did.\n \n You'd see no contradictions in what you posted.\n \n Seriously...\n \n Drink the flavoraid.\n \n emoticon_xbouncer\n \n edit:\n Capitalize, size increase, italicize and underline various parts of my post. Color them some and insert random, out of contest bible passages to support my claims.\n\n \n I think it's manifestly obvious that I'm a prophet.\n \n Therefore, the question of my diety should also be of little surprise.",

   "Ok- so apologetics = opinions. Explainations of the unexplainable are what? Opinions. If your argument is going to discount opinion why include this with religious debates? If your argument is that all sects of Christianity disagree so your view is opinion and therefore unacceptable, why sucker Christians in with mostly bad Bible bashing quotes (I even gave you some better ones lol) just to say that. Just say it outright.\n \n Your opinion doesn't make a lot of sense to me, why would I care? Half of your quoted scripture was tailor made to make the scriptures look stupid but is easily refutable by simply quoting the verse entirely or along with the surrounding verses. You did read them all, right, and the surrounding text? \n \n You can straw man people for expressing opinions (without answering or conceeding where your quoted scripture was right or wrong) regarding your own opinion on the unexplainable, which other's don't universally accept either...but that's sort of like forcing a peice of chocolate into someone's mouth, holding your hand over their mouth so they can't spit it out, and then getting angry they tasted chocolate.\n \n \n = tell me your opinion.\nI was hoping for logic. Penfold refers to it as, \"Knowing something for which there is no evidence, is merely superstition.\" I like that. Then my interest would be in why is it so very important to so many to bet their lives on superstition and try to direct the country in the same direction? This would not opinion. These scriptures are facts to so many without reason attached. So, my original question remains. . . . . .",

Then my interest would be in why is it so very important to so many to bet their lives on superstition and try to direct the country in the same direction? This would not opinion. These scriptures are facts to so many without reason attached. So, my original question remains. . . . . .\n\n \n I ask no one to bet their lives. Gambling will not bring you any closer to Jesus than cursing God and following satan. If they don't want to love God, for God's sake don't go fill a pew in church thinking well I'm just covering all my bases. Trust me God will not like that. Nor do I force my religious views upon my country. Intelligent Design in schools? No way! I learned the ToE from a thinly disguised hippie that only took a bath and laid off the pachouli because the school board probably would have fired him if he didn't. Too bad they never caught him smoking a bong in the boiler room, I did. If you want the ToE taught by people like that fine, keep wondering why people turn fundamentalist Christian. If the parents can't teach it, I wouldn't want religion taught by our sewer of a public school system. Talk about cutting off your nose to spite your face.\n \n That the US has and will pass laws against my theology may bother me but I'm not wailing about it from the rooftops. My concern is the church, and how effectively it's working. If the church can't be an effective witness for Christ, I for sure will not expect the gov't to do it for them. I'm not sure why I'm painted as wanting to force the country to accept religion now. I wouldn't want our current worthless congress for sure, or any other congress no matter how highly I thought of them enforcing a state religion on anyone. If you want to bash Bible scripture, go ahead, if you want proof, go seek it yourself. If you're going to ask why scriptures contradict then not directly answer comments about the validity of the quoted scriptures, and say no one can prove it so it's all worthless, why not say that first, and I wouldn't have bothered.\n \n As for reason, I can not prove to you that God exists, because He has not shown Himself to every person alive and told them He exists. As for even more reason, how do we know anything to be true?\n \n If you have come to the conclusion that the only reason you know something to be true is if you can figure it out rationally, you have accepted a form of truth knowing called rationalism. If you have, are you prepared to prove to me that your mind functions accurately, and that your mind can assemble facts into a logical system of truth? You cannot prove to me that your mind works accurately because you'd have to use your own mind. Or you can use somebody else's mind, but how would I know that their mind works accurately? It's a never ending circle.\n \n How about the empiricist, who says he/she knows truth by that which they can experience with their 5 senses? Are your senses fooling you? Do you see a lake in the middle of the highway on a hot day? How do I know your senses are not fooling you here and there? Mine do. They also cannot prove to me their system of truth. You can not prove beyond question your senses are accurate, because you'd have to use your senses to test your senses, or someone else's senses to test your senses, ad nauseum.\n \n You can give me theories based on your rationalism, and/or data based on your empiricism, how would you prove beyond question that the source of the data you've sensed and/or the theories you've rationalized are functioning correctly? The numbers of scientists and so called normal people that hold the same system of knowing truth do not count. Far more people in the world believe in superstition and are swept to the side arbitrarily as the unwashed masses because they can't prove their beliefs. \n \n So what's with the logical high horses? If you're about to marginalize Christians across the board for believing that which is irrational, do you think that makes you any less fundamentalist and narrow minded as you claim they are? Do you think that if a fundy starts a post in the evo debate and quotes nothing but scripture while ignoring well thought out posts and demanding biblical proof of evo, it is any worse than someone posting the Bible is contradictory in the religious debates, and then ignoring scriptural evidence that refutes some of their claims while demanding logical, factual proof of God's existence?",

If the church can't be an effective witness for Christ, I for sure will not expect the gov't to do it for them.\nAt least we found some common ground here!\n \n As for the rest of it, Christianity, in the world view makes no sense. The God of the universe EXCLUDES all who do not acknowledge HIM. Deathbed conversions don't do it for me, nor the piety I see daily in those who presumably walk the walk; the dichotomy of claiming one stance while exercising another, similar to the verses I pulled in this thread. Original sin? This is the blatant concept of keeping people enslaved spiritually until they die.\n \n A much more productive view of God would be to observe and honor the nature created by God and love your neighbors. In churches this concept, by-and-large, has been replaced with greed. \"To hell with him, what's in it for me,\" is a prevailing attitude in places of worship as in the rest of the world. \n \n Christianity, as in every other dogmatic religion, is one of pick and choose. How convenient! Example: We are bound and determined, as Christians, to condem abortions and homosexuals while we refuse to stone adulterers or handle snakes, heal the sick, etc. Or the big one, to sell all that we have, give to the poor, pick up our cross and follow him daily. So, I return to simple logic. \n \n Christianity is truth, justice and the American way. It's a figment of Superman fame! . . . . .Faster than a bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, able to leap tall buildings in a single bound. Look up, it's a Christian! Give to build greater places of worship, to pay the preachers and, if there's enough left. . . . . then give to the poor. Remember the crumbs under the table? \n \n Foolishness I say, foolishness.",
