   "Moms' Genetics Might Help Produce Gay Sons\n Women with multiple gay sons make a key chromosomal choice, study suggests.\n \n By Randy Dotinga\n HealthDay Reporter\n \n TUESDAY, Feb. 21 (HealthDay News) -- New research adds a twist to the debate on the origins of sexual orientation, suggesting that the genetics of mothers of multiple gay sons act differently than those of other women.\n \n Scientists found that almost one fourth of the mothers who had more than one gay son processed X chromosomes in their bodies in the same way. Normally, women randomly process the chromosomes in one of two ways -- half go one way, half go the other.\n \n The research \"confirms that there is a strong genetic basis for sexual orientation, and that for some gay men, genes on the X chromosome are involved,\" said study co-author Sven Bocklandt, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California at Los Angeles.\n \n The link between genetics and sexual orientation has been a hot topic for more than a decade as a few scientists have tried to find genes that might make people gay or straight. In the new study, Bocklandt and colleagues examined a phenomenon called \"X-chromosome inactivation.\"\n \n While females have two X chromosomes, they actually require only one and routinely inactivate the other, Bocklandt said. \"That way, both men and women have basically one functional X chromosome,\" he added. Men have both an X and Y chromosome, but the Y chromosome plays a much smaller role, he said.\n \n Women typically inactivate one of their two X chromosomes at random. \"It's like flipping a coin,\" Bocklandt said. \"If you look at a woman in any given (bodily) tissue, you'd expect about half of the cells to inactivate one X, and half would inactivate the other.\"\n \n In the new study, researchers looked at 97 mothers of gay sons and 103 mothers without gay sons to see if there was any difference in how they handled their X chromosomes. The findings appear in the February issue of the journal Human Genetics.\n \n \"When we looked at women who have gay kids, in those with more than one gay son, we saw a quarter of them inactivate the same X in virtually every cell we checked,\" Bocklandt said. \"That's extremely unusual.\"\n \n Forty-four of the women had more than one gay son.\n \n In contrast, 4 percent of mothers with no gay sons activated the chromosome and 13 percent of those with just one gay son did.\n \n The phenomenon of being more likely to inactivate one X chromosome -- known as \"extreme skewing\" -- is typically seen only in families that have major genetic irregularities, Bocklandt said.\n \n What does this all mean? The researchers aren't sure, but Bocklandt thinks he and his colleagues are moving closer to understanding the origins of sexual orientation.\n \n \"What's really remarkable and very novel about this is that you see something in the bodies of women that is linked to a behavioral trait in their sons,\" he said. \"That's new, that's unheard of.\"\n \n Still, there are caveats. Dr. Ionel Sandovici, a genetics researcher at The Babraham Institute in Cambridge, England, pointed out that most of the mothers of multiple gay sons didn't share the unusual X-chromosome trait. And the study itself is small, which means more research will need to be done to confirm its findings, Sandovici said.\n \n Ultimately, Sandovici added, the origins of sexual orientation remain \"rather a complicated biological puzzle.\"\n \n And this line of research does have its critics. Some have worried that, in the future, manipulation of a \"gay gene\" or genes might be used as a method of preventing homosexuality in utero, or perhaps even after. But Bocklandt said these kinds of fears shouldn't stand in the way of legitimate scientific research.\n \n \"We're trying to understand one of the most critical human traits: the ability to love and be attracted to others. Without sexual reproduction we would not exist, and sexual selection played an essential role in evolution,\" he said. \"Yet, we have no idea how it works, and that's what we're trying to find out. As with any research, the knowledge you acquire could be used for benefit or harm. But if [scientists] would have avoided research because we were afraid of what we were going to find, then we would still be living in the stone age.\"\n \n More information\n \n Learn about the debate over a \"gay gene\" from the PBS' Frontline (www.pbs.org ).\n \n Copyright \u00a9 2006 ScoutNews LLC.

There problem is that there are NO real facts to work with here on this issue.

The point is, genetic disposition and the moral question are two separate things. If they weren't, a whole slew of bad behaviors in society would be deemed just dandy simply on the basis that people are genetically inclined to do that sort of thing. Sorry, you can keep that sort of morality. You see, when it comes to issues like homosexuality and gay pride, principles are always matters of opinion. There is no official Morality Committee that sets standards. Don't believe me? Take any controversial issue (we'll leave gay pride out since that's your pet issue): abortion, capital punishment, assisted suicide, legalized marajuana, and many others. On each issue you'll find people on BOTH sides of the fence saying \"my principles tell me that it's wrong/right, and so I hold to my particular morality on this subject.\" Principles tell the pro-choicer that abortion shouldn't be made illegal, and principles also tell the pro-lifer that abortion on demand is bad. The person who says \"justice must be done and capital punishment should be allowed\" is speaking out of the principles he feels are the right ones. But the same holds true of the the person who feels no one should ever be put to death for a crime.",

It's damned hard to maintain that support as the years go by, but I manage.\n \n \nThe only view that's legit is the one that says, at all costs, that it's not harmful--you know, the one supposedly supported by all those supposed statistics, facts, and data that no one ever seems to see?\n\n \n What are you talking about? There's no proof of stable, healthy, productive gay people? I thought you knew gay people. Are all the gay people in your life harmful to themselves and to you?\n \n You really are a piece of work. You go from defending ex-gay reparative therapy stuff because there are a handful of examples of individual who prefer living that way. Then you turn around and can't find examples of happy, OUT gay people. Talk about selectivity!!!!\n \n \nAnd then there's the ones of us for whom harm just isn't the only factor in determining whats moral and what's not--you know, those dastardly religious folk. From what I can tell, they don't count in your book either.\n\n \n First of all, MOST religious folks don't share your views, so please don't corral them into your herd to make it look bigger. You don't want us to generalize, so you don't get to either.\n \n Again, you're free to believe what you want. But your believing it is hardly a sufficient basis for me -- or anyone else -- to accept it as true. And it's an explicitly insufficient basis for law.",

   "Listen here I am gay my brother is gay, my father was gay, his brother was bisexual. I think it runs in the family allthough I assumed it ran on the Y Chromosome.\n \n Genetic proof is a double edge sword for if it being gay is proven genetically then I see gay babies being aborted because they are gay. I would still respect a womans right to make the desicion about her body. I can also see the anti abortion crowd changing their tune about abortion and saying \"Stop all abortions except for the gay babies\"\n\n your father was gay and still happened to have at least 2 kids? hmmm.....\n \n a \"gay family\" does not indicate that being gay has a genetic source anymore than a family history of single parents means that being a single parent is genetic. there are more christian families than gay families, with multiple generations of preachers. maybe being a christian is genetic. i know quite a few friends who joined the police force because their father, brother and uncles were also policemen. there must be a police gene as well, right?",
