   "Maslow's hierarchy of needs\n \n many of us are familiar with maslow's hierarchy of needs. it is a psychological breakdown of what we as humans are motivated by. we are designed to seek the satisfaction of our needs, and our psyche rewards us with a feeling of satisfaction when these needs are met. the order of the hierarchy is significant. as soon as any level on the pyramid is attained and overcome, and those needs are satisfied and sustained, we are instinctively and inately motivated to achieve the next level. however, beyond the top of the pyramid, maslow doesnt go any further. the fact is that humans at any level on this pyramid, even at the proposed top, are never satisfied, and are motivated to go to the next level. are there levels to attain that motivate people that have achieved the top of the pyramid?\n \n it seems that the next level after self-actualization is the need for domination, followed by absolute power, omnipotence and immortality. for those who have already achieved everything on the pyramid, this is the natural progression",

   "Maslow's model has never been demonstrated empirically. I don't think anyone buys it anymore and I don't know why it still appears in Psych 101 texts, except maybe for its historic significance. (I have seen it discussed in organizational behavior books as well, and I'd bet it's in management books.) It's a mildly interesting idea, but not very useful anyway. Lower needs become \"unmet\" or \"less met\" and people jump all around the levels all the time.\n \n It may seem to make intuitive sense that basic biological needs must be met first before we move on to self-actualization (whatever that is) but that does not appear to be the case, in reality. It appears the levels are pretty arbitrary as well. Maslow sorta kinda just made them up.",

   "All it did was re-inforce the misconception that all morality is relative. It isn't.\n\n \n I think there was good and bad that came out of the human potential movement, but just like a lot of things. I would not equate it with any great evil that struck the world, however. And for the most part, I think it brought a lot of positive changes and better understanding of who we are (which is what psychology is supposed to about). There was a lot of experimentation. Live and learn, as they say. And, sometimes, we go forth just to find ourselves back exactly where we started from. But, now, at least, we understand *why*.\n \n As for morality being relative, I don't feel that way about certain things, but I take even my own certitude with a grain of salt, since, in every logical sense of the question, I can't *see* any further than the relativism itself.\n \n Even the greatest persons in the Bible are relativistic thinkers, IMO. Take Jesus' views on divorce, for example. He argues that the rules change depending upon a different set of circumstances.\n \n Not that this makes too much of a difference, to me, either. Since I don't accept the Bible, verbatim, on faith. I disagree with so much of it. But it provides, for some, the closest thing to an absolute moralism. And even there, it's only guiding lights, so to speak, that change. We are told not to kill, and in the next story, God helps a leader to kill in the name of justice. Etc. With other people's holy books or holy persons or holy keepers of the absolute moralism having different versions, as well. And then, of course, everyone disagrees within each version, their interpretation as to what is the absolute moralism, being the absolutely correct one.",
