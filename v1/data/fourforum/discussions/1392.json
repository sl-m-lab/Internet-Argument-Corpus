When this happens, the child has to either be delivered or aborted. There are many determining factors as to which route should be taken, including of course, several distress- related health issues. Do you know what happens when a fetus goes into distress, Parcum? Lots of things, and none of them good.\n \n I know someone who had this happen to them. Luckily, they were much closer to full term. First, the sac tore. Then the child went into distress (much like a panic) and emptied its bowels and bladder, and then in its struggle, it tried to breathe, filling its lungs with fluid. This child was born with pneumonia, which soon became a serious infection caused by the merconium that was in the fluid, and thus in her lungs. THis family was lucky. The child just celebrated her 5th birthday. But they are still very much in debt, and they call this beloved child their half-million dollar baby.\n \n If it took a month after the sac being torn before the abortion was done, the doctors were obviously trying everything in their power to keep the child in the womb. Your article does not mention why the abortion was done, it does not go into the child's medical state, which surely had a poor prognosis. \n \n I would trust her doctors to know more about the situation than you, the armchair detective. \n \n In your opinion, quality of life takes no precedence. You would rather a child spend its entire life in misery, supported by machinery and extremely costly medicine, than to have compassion on that child. Some people do not agree. Some people think that their role as parents to try to prevent their child from suffering, even if it means the child does not live. \n \n Oh yeah, and God forbid- some women place a bit of value on their own lives too.\n \n For the record, Parcum, not a single factor of this situation would have changed by declaring that the child had a right to life. The sac was torn because the doctor was under the impression that he was removing a contraceptive device (something I know you support) and he tore the sac. A month later the abortion was performed- something the patient has to consent to. \n \n The only thing that would have prevented this matter is a good interpreter.",

   "I also don't see the relevance of this title. To have had an abortion preformed on the wrong woman would require that an abortion was scheduled to take place. It was clearly not here - this was a medical error. \n\n The abortion was scheduled to take place long after the medical error took place. The article clearly explains that the sac was ruptured, and therefore a month later the child had to be aborted.\n \n\n Once the amniotic sac is ruptured, though, this man is right. An abortion does not at all have to be given - it will occur naturally. I don't believe for a second that this woman had an abortion after having her amniotic sac ruptured a month prior; she, in fact, most likely had a dialation and evactuation to remove a deceased fetus. That is not an abortion - that is a medical necessity.\n \n It will not neccessarily naturally occur. I know a few children who have survived this ordeal. In one case, the leak was minor, and corrected itself, in the other, delivery was induced and the child was born prematurely. In both cases, they are healthy children. Once again, this article does not indicate what circumstances brought about the need for an abortion, that is left to our speculation. But it is clear that the doctors thought it neccessary, and so did the mother at the time, since you have to give consent for such a procedure.\n \n\n On the rights of the mother - it is insane to require that a woman continue to carry a child when both are in imminet danger, as in this case. The end result of her not having a D&E completed would most likely include the mother going septic and both ending up dead. In cases where the mother's life alone is in imminent danger - that is a very personal choice that should not be trodden upon by government intrusion.\n\n agreed",

   "I agree with you Josephine, the title is sensationalist and misleading. They did not give a woman an abortion \"by accident\". They accidentaly endangered the fetus, causing an abortion to be needed later on. The title implies that there was a mix-up and the woman was mistaken for someone who was scheduled to have an abortion. Instead, the doctor wasn't even aware she was pregnant until he had already pierced the amniotic sac.",
