   "O.K., here's an idea for the education chopping block. I don't know if it's ever been discussed before (or done anywhere). Elect principals from the body of teachers working at a given school. Have a set number of terms they can serve for a set number of years per term, like representatives. Voters would be comprised of teachers at the school, parents, and students, or some selection and combination of the three groups. Following the principal's term/s, they would return to their regular classroom job, teaching. Teachers about to retire, perhaps not eligible (since they wouldn't have to experience the fruits of their work upon returning to the classroom). \n \n Also consider rotating the job of principal, where each teacher at the school just goes in for X number of years, then returns to the classroom, and the next one in line gets their turn.\n \n Discuss.",

   "I've seen policies that advocate running schools as a workers cooperative, with teachers electing the management. There seem to me to be too many conflicts of interest with regard to allowing parents or students to choose, and neither has much idea what the job entails. School management and leadership is a different skillset (at least on the current model) from being an effective teacher. A school lives or dies on the strength of its leadership, and actually an election via an uninformed electorate is a terrible way to choose it.",

It skews the curriculum in favour of the subjects being tested, and more time is spent preparing for tests that should be spent on actual education. This year, with the abolition of KS3 tests in the UK, I can spend time teaching my year 9 class rather than going through past papers. This situation is even more prevalent in KS2, with 10 and 11 year olds being placed under enormous pressure to do well because the school is judged by their results in national tests. So they spend around half of curriculum time in their final year at primary school preparing for the end of key stage tests. It's madness. People who think you raise standards by testing more think that you can fatten a pig by weighing it more often. All that happens is that the pig is given loads of water before being weighed.",

We have constant complaints in the UK that students achieving grade C at GCSE maths (a national benchmark considered essential by most employers) can't add up/do perecentages/understand proportions etc., and the reason they can't is precisely because that grade is used as a national benchmark, so it is in the interests of teachers and students to have that grade, even if the aptitude of the student does not warrant it, as both student and teacher will be judged by it.\n \n You're right that students don't often think of the bigger picture, but I'm not suggesting they should.

It's hard enough to get the general population to care about the policies of the day, let alone understand them.\n \n I still don't see the harm in setting a standard amount of information a child must know before progressing to the next grade and holding teachers accountable for that level.\n \n I can't site it right now but I can find it if you want me too. When Harvard was in it's infancy the requirements to get in were almost the same as the requirements for a Bachelors Degree is today. We demand way too little from both our students and our teachers today and we are starting to see the fruits of our laziness as each day goes by. \n \n I don't mean this as an offence toward teachers, I just think it's what we have allowed to happen.",
