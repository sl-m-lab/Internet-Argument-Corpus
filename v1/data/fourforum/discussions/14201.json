From your site.\n \n The solution is that these animals were categorized with other animals who appeared to chew cud because they move their jaws in the same manner as the other animals listed.\n \n Kind of a lame answer. Why would they be categorized with other animals that chew cud just because they move their jaws in the same manner as the other animals?\n \n This one right here wasnt in my link but I still want to talk about it.\n \n Did people really live hundreds of years according to Genesis? | Christian Apologetics and Research Ministry\n \n They claim that people could have lived hundred of years because they were in great health and because there great amounts of water suspended in the sky that blocked out the suns rays. What about disease? And organs do eventually give out due to age. Medical science itself proves that wrong. They dont answer that at all.\n \n Now for another part of one of your links. My response will be in bold.\n \n Does the Bible teach that the Earth is flat?\n \n We begin with a bit of groundwork. It should be understood that the Hebrews, like all ANE cultures, obviously lacked the scientific terminology we use to describe things today. We should not expect descriptions of \"tectonic plates\" or of \"molten lava\". On a lesser scale, we will find that the Hebrews lacked key words which would have been most useful in describing cosmological phenomena. So god couldnt give them a way to describe the phenomena?\n \n Do these imply a physical dome of some sort? Actually, it is not possible to determine one way or another, for the Hebrews (like many cultures of this time) lacked a word-concept of infinite physical space. With that in mind, we may ask how they would describe the sky as it exists, and metaphor is the most probable choice. So the Hebrews couldnt just say the sky goes on forever without stopping? Weird. And god couldnt help him with that wording? Strange.\n \n And in the circle the earth part they didnt include the passage about the person or god or something (cant remember who or what) that climbed the mountain and could see the entire earth.\n \n And they claim there is no Hebrew word for sphere but I found this. &#1499;&#1491;&#1493;&#1512;\n \n Translation English Hebrew sphere\n \n And so I typed it into google and then translated it back to english and came up with this.\n \n Google Translate\n \n So it seems there is a Hebrew word for sphere or at least ball which is a sphere and more accurately describes the world then circle.\n \n Oh and I didnt see anything about the sun revolving around the earth in your links.",

   "Well lets get started. From your site.\n \n The solution is that these animals were categorized with other animals who appeared to chew cud because they move their jaws in the same manner as the other animals listed.\n \n Kind of a lame answer. Why would they be categorized with other animals that chew cud just because they move their jaws in the same manner as the other animals?\n \n This one right here wasnt in my link but I still want to talk about it.\n \n Did people really live hundreds of years according to Genesis? | Christian Apologetics and Research Ministry\n \n They claim that people could have lived hundred of years because they were in great health and because there great amounts of water suspended in the sky that blocked out the suns rays. What about disease? And organs do eventually give out due to age. Medical science itself proves that wrong. They dont answer that at all.\n \n Now for another part of one of your links. My response will be in bold.\n \n Does the Bible teach that the Earth is flat?\n \n We begin with a bit of groundwork. It should be understood that the Hebrews, like all ANE cultures, obviously lacked the scientific terminology we use to describe things today. We should not expect descriptions of \"tectonic plates\" or of \"molten lava\". On a lesser scale, we will find that the Hebrews lacked key words which would have been most useful in describing cosmological phenomena. So god couldnt give them a way to describe the phenomena?\n \n Do these imply a physical dome of some sort? Actually, it is not possible to determine one way or another, for the Hebrews (like many cultures of this time) lacked a word-concept of infinite physical space. With that in mind, we may ask how they would describe the sky as it exists, and metaphor is the most probable choice. So the Hebrews couldnt just say the sky goes on forever without stopping? Weird. And god couldnt help him with that wording? Strange.\n \n And in the circle the earth part they didnt include the passage about the person or god or something (cant remember who or what) that climbed the mountain and could see the entire earth.\n \n And they claim there is no Hebrew word for sphere but I found this. &#1499;&#1491;&#1493;&#1512;\n \n Translation English Hebrew sphere\n \n And so I typed it into google and then translated it back to english and came up with this.\n \n Google Translate\n \n So it seems there is a Hebrew word for sphere or at least ball which is a sphere and more accurately describes the world then circle.\n \n Oh and I didnt see anything about the sun revolving around the earth in your links.\n\n \n \n Addison your my HERO!!!

God's people now are all to be \"circumcised\" spiritually. Physical circumcision is no longer necessary for religious purposes. It was a forerunner or type of what God really wanted-circumcision of the heart (Deuteronomy 10:16; 30:6; Jeremiah 4:4). Paul told the congregation in Rome that physical circumcision is of no spiritual benefit (Romans 2:25-29). Spiritual circumcision, though, is a process of conversion. That Christ circumcises us spiritually is made plain in Colossians 2:10-11.\n \n Read more: Circumcision of the Heart (Forerunner Commentary) :: Bible Tools\n \n Always glad to help you out, Brigid.\n \n Acts 7:51\n\n \n Keep warping God's word and he is going to get mad.

Now, some less sophisticated apologists have tried to argue that the &#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#946;&#946;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#957; here refers not to the ordinary Sabbath but to the day before the \"high sabbath\" of Passover. This obviously won't work, since, according to the Marcan chronology, it is already Passover:\n \n Mark 14.12: &#954;&#945;&#953; &#964;&#951; &#960;&#961;&#969;&#964;&#951; &#951;&#956;&#949;&#961;&#945; &#964;&#969;&#957; &#945;&#950;&#965;&#956;&#969;&#957; &#959;&#964;&#949; &#964;&#959; &#960;&#945;&#963;&#967;&#945; &#949;&#952;&#965;&#959;&#957; &#955;&#949;&#947;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#945;&#965;&#964;&#969; &#959;&#953; &#956;&#945;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#945;&#965;&#964;&#959;&#965; &#960;&#959;&#965; &#952;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#962; &#945;&#960;&#949;&#955;&#952;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962; &#949;&#964;&#959;&#953;&#956;&#945;&#963;&#969;&#956;&#949;&#957; &#953;&#957;&#945; &#966;&#945;&#947;&#951;&#962; &#964;&#959; &#960;&#945;&#963;&#967;&#945;\n \n And on the first day of the Unleavened [bread] when they sacrificed the Passover, his disciples said to him \"where do you want us to go to prepare so you might eat the Passover?\"\n \n Regardless of what Mark means when he says \"the first day of the Unleavened,\" we know that the paschal lambs were slaughtered on the 14th of Nisan. This means that 14.17 (&#954;&#945;&#953; &#959;&#968;&#953;&#945;&#962; &#947;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#951;&#962;...and having become evening) is refering to the 15th Nisan, Passover proper.\n \n Matt (27.62), John (19.31, 42) and less directly Luke (23.56 and 24.1), all agree with Mark on it being a Friday.\n\n \n Thank you, Art. \n \n Well, pappi - there you go!

   "\n 1) why does he not give us any logical reason to believe he exists\n \n\n \n We're back to square one. How about this time you actually study the evidences in the following site?\n \n http://www.godandscience.org\n \n You can start with the \"Answers for Atheists\" tab on the top left.\n \n And then I'll give you one more:\n \n THE SUN DARKENED AT NOON\n \n Circa 750 B.C.\n \n According to Amos 1:1, Amos prophesied during the reigns of Uzziah, king of Judah (767-739 B.C.), and Jeroboam, king of Israel (782-753 B.C.). The name \"Amos\" is derived from the Hebrew term meaning, \"lift a burden,\" or \"burden-bearer\" (note Isaiah 9:4, speaking of the coming Messiah as one who would carry our burdens, and also Matthew 11:28). His calling by God was to foretell of pending judgments upon a number of surrounding nations, and particularly of a coming judgment upon Israel. As is common with other Biblical prophets, along with the promise of impending judgment, God also gave Amos a glimpse of events that would soon occur in the life of the coming Messiah, though the significance of what was prophesied may or may not have been made known to Amos. And so it is in the Old Testament book of Amos that we find a prophecy that for many centuries was looked upon with wonder and curiosity:\n \n \"'In that day,' declares the Sovereign Lord, 'I will make the sun go down at noon and darken the earth in broad daylight....I will make that time like mourning for an only son, and the end of it like a bitter day.'\" (Amos 8:9-10)\n \n It probably wasn't until the day of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ in 32 A.D. that the prophecy of Amos took on clarity and meaning, for in Matthew 27:45 Jesus had just been nailed to the cross when the Bible records:\n \n \"From the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land.\"\n \n Just as the \"Star of Bethlehem\" marked the birth of Christ, so now God brought forth another celestial miracle to pronounce His death. This prophecy is one of those that is beyond the control of mortal man, and as such it dispels the theory that Christ could have manipulated events so as to make it appear that He was the Messiah. But is there any evidence that this really occurred? Did the sun go dark at noonday? In his book, Evidence That Demands a Verdict (Volume 1, pages 81-87), Josh McDowell provides the following historical evidence that what took place at Calvary was more that just fanciful mythology:\n \n Concerning the Samaritan-born historian Thallus, circa 52 A.D: (The writings of Thallus no longer exist, yet were alluded to by the historian Julius Africanus, as follows): \"Thallus, in the third book of his histories, explains away this darkness as an eclipse of the sun - unreasonably, as it seems to me - unreasonably, of course, because a solar eclipse could not take place at the time of a full moon, and it was at the season of the Paschal full moon that Christ died.\"\n \n Likewise, Africanus wrote concerning the writings of another first century historian by the name of Phlegon: \"....during the time of Tiberius Caesar an eclipse of the sun occurred during the full moon.\" \n \n Phlegon is also mentioned by the historian Origen in his work, \"Contra Celsum,\" book 2, sections 14, 39, and 59: \"Phlegon mentioned the eclipse that took place during the crucifixion of the Lord Christ....and this is shown by the historical account itself of Tiberius Caesar.\" Apparently at one time there were historical accounts of the strange darkness that came over the land that were kept in the official archives of Tiberius Caesar, though they are likely lost to history.\n \n Scholar Paul Maier said of the darkness in a 1968 book , Pontius Pilate, \n \"This phenomenon was visible in Rome, Athens, and other Mediterranean cities. According to Tertullian....it was a 'cosmic' or 'world event'. Phlegon, a Greek author from Caria writing a chronology soon after 137 AD, reported that in the fourth year of the 202nd Olympiad (i.e. 33 AD)there was \"the greatest eclipse of the sun\" and that it became night in the sixth hour of the day (noon) so that the stars even appeared in the heavens. There was a great earthquake in Bithynia and many things were overturned in Nicaea.\" \n \n The darkness spoken of in the book of Matthew occurred between noon and three P.M. in the afternoon (from the sixth to the ninth hours, as the Jews were noted as referring to the sixth and the ninth hours of daylight). Note that a solar eclipse will take less than an hour to complete, and a total solar eclipse lasts just a few minutes. This, coupled with the fact that a solar eclipse cannot occur during a full moon (the moon would be on the 'other' side of the earth), provides further evidence that what occurred was something other than an eclipse of the sun.  Just what it was no one can say for sure, just that from recorded historical sources there was a strange darkness during the time of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. From God's perspective, it surely was a time of mourning for His only begotten son. \n \n Jesus once said, \"I am the light of the world.\" So it shouldn't be surprising that during his death there might be a time of darkness over the land. \n \n \n REFERENCES\n \n McDowell, Josh.

Calling Thallus \"Samaritan born\" is based on an identification of Africanus' Thallus with the the \"Thallus\" of Josephus AJ 18.6.4, but Josephus does not name any \"Thallus\" here. All extant mss read \"&#954;&#945;&#953; &#947;&#945;&#961; &#951;&#957; &#945;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#962; &#963;&#945;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#949;&#965;&#962; &#947;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#953;&#963;&#945;&#961;&#959;&#962; &#948;&#949; &#945;&#960;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#965;&#952;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#962;,\" literally something like \"and there was another of Samaritan race and freedman of Caesar,\" a coherent if somewhat confusing reference.

The Armenian of Eusebius' Chronicon 1.100 mentions \"the three books of Thallus, containing an account of events from the capture of Troy until the 167th Olympiad,\" a period that closed in 112-109 BCE, far too early. This led to conjectural amendations; the original Greek, it was supposed, read &#963;&#950; (207th Olympiad, which concluded 49-52 CE) and was changed to &#961;&#949;&#950; (167) at some point. But, as I say, this is pure conjecture. It could just as easily have closed in the 167th and been added to by some other author later. It could be a reference to another now totally lost work. It could have read some other date entirely (e.g. 217th). In other words, he could have written well into the second century -- at least before Africanus -- and thus be dependent on the gospels.",

Like everyone else, you're no doubt getting closer to the grave every day you live. Your 'Greek scholarship' won't save you. Your money won't save you. Your worldly intellect won't save you. According to the Bible, without Christ, you're dead in your sins with no hope of redemption. Even your own conscience testifies that you have committed many wrongs against others in your lifetime. \n \n I recommend you review the following link, and the Four Spiritual Laws that you will find there.\n \n The main gist of which is salvation:\n \n God Loves The World\n \n Remember:\n \n But now a righteousness from God, apart from law, has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify. This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.\" - Romans 3:21-24 \n \n Be wise. Receive the truth. \n \n Jesus is Lord!\n\n \n So, what did Art get in response to a very well thought out and scholarly presentation?? He got a meaningless sermon and a cut/paste.",

Where, exactly, have I gone wrong? \n \n \nAnd why do you engage in gross overgeneralizations like that?\n\n \n I call it a factual observation about your behavior. \n \n \nPreviously I believe you admitted that there was nothing you had that significantly changes any of the major tenets / beliefs of Christianity (i.e. the Virgin Birth, the miracles of Christ, his crucifixion, and his resurrection).

That hardly means there are no good reasons for doubting that Jesus was actually born of a virgin, rose from the dead or had supernatural powers.\n \n \n[snip more preaching]\n",
