   "Every time the KKK burns a cross NRA members are there. So what? Every time they burn a cross Christianity is there.\n\n \n The NRA is nowhere to be found when the Klan decides to burn a cross. In fact, BfC's suggestion that the NRA has any possible association with the Klan is an absolute lie. \n \n The Klan was founded in 1866 by former Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest in Pulaski, Tennessee. The Klan used terror as its primary weapon to cower blacks into submission, and it frequently attempted to forcibly disarm blacks so they would be unable to resist Klan oppression. Additionally, throughout the south Klan sympathizers passed \"black codes\" which forbade blacks from possessing arms. These injustices led Congress to propose the 14th. Amendment, which had as a stated purpose the protection of the black man's Second Amendment RKBA.\n \n The NRA, on the other hand, was charted in 1871 by an act of the New York state legislature. The charter was granted at the request of a group of former Union army veterans who founded the NRA. Contrary to Klan goals, the NRA has never supported any disarmament of citizens based upon race.\n \n At approximately the same time the NRA was chartered in New York, Congress passed (in the 1870-71 legislative sessions) what became known as the \"enforcement acts,\" which effectively outlawed the Klan. This is a known fact which BfC CORRECTLY cites. What BfC deliberately chooses to ignore, however, is what happened AFTER the laws were passed:\n \n These acts were signed into law by President Ulysess S. Grant. Grant was no friend of the Klan, and was instead hailed as \"a humane conqueror and the benefactor of an enslaved and despised race, a race who will ever cherish a grateful remembrance of his name, fame and great services . . . . \" - Henry O. Wagoner, from a letter to Frederick Douglass. The \"enforcement acts\" acts empowered President Grant to suspend the right of Habeas Corpus and to use the military of the United States to suppress the Klan. Suppress it he did, and by 1872 the Klan was effectively crushed (only to rise again when it was later ignored). \n \n Among the significant events in the early fight against the Klan was the decision made by Union army general Phillip Sheridan to remove from office the Governors of Texas and Louisiana for impeding efforts to destroy the Klan.\n \n How does this history of Klan suppression by Grant and Sheridan relate to the NRA? After Grant left the presidency, the membership of the NRA elected him to be the 8th. President of that organization. When Grant finished his term as NRA president, the membership of the NRA elected General Phillip Sheridan it's 9th. President. In fact, eight of the first ten NRA presidents were veterans of the Union army. \n \n Is it possible that the NRA has since that time been secretly infiltrated by Klansmen? I tend to doubt it. Gun control has always been a tool of racism, and there would be no purpose for Klansmen to join an organization which has consistently promoted ownership of firearms by all citizens regardless of race. If they chose to join anyway, then wouldn't they have left in disgust in 1957, when they were unable to prevent the NRA leadership from actively helping a group of black men in Monroe, N.C. form an NRA chartered shooting club? After all, the avowed purpose in forming the club was to use the charter status to obtain military surplus firearms so it's black members could defend themselves against Klan attacks. What reason would Klansmen have to feel welcome in an organization that helped give blacks the ability to shoot back the next time they decided to \"hood up\"? However, if this wasn't enough to drive Klansmen away, then surely they would have left when Charlton Heston became NRA president. After all, they would never be able to forgive or forget his civil rights legacy. They would angrily remember him answering the call to work tirelessly with Dr. King to break the color barrier in Hollywood. The would bitterly remember him marching with Dr. King, and they would plug their ears whenever other NRA members fondly recalled his passionate appeals for recognition of the same black civil rights they had for years tried to suppress. While these Klansmen's trucks may sport a white hood draped over the gun rack, you will not see them proudly displaying the famous NRA bumper sticker proclaiming that their president was Charlton Heston. \n \n In short, the NRA never has been, and I believe never will be, a haven for Klansmen. Klansmen may use guns, but that does not make them friends of the NRA anymore than using a burning cross makes them friends of the Pope. BfC is certainly free to suggest all it wants that the NRA was coincidentally formed the same year the Klan was outlawed (1871), and it can deliberately try to give the uninformed the clear impression that the Klan and the NRA are linked in some fashion. We call that free speech. There is a saying, however, that \"if you are going to be stupid, then you've got to be tough.\" If MM is going to be stupid enough to try and deliberately create a false impression of history, then he's got to be tough enough to take the pounding he's getting now that he has been caught.\n \n -------------------------\n \n \"False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advantages for one imaginary or trifling inconvenience; that would take fire from men because it burns, and water because one may drown in it; that has no remedy for evils, except destruction. The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity, the most important of the code, will respect the less important and arbitrary ones, which can be violated with ease and impunity, and which, if strictly obeyed, would put an end to personal liberty--so dear to men, so dear to the enlightened legislator--and subject innocent persons to all the vexations that the guilty alone ought to suffer? Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man. They ought to be designated as laws not preventative but fearful of crimes, produced by the tumultuous impression of a few isolated facts, and not by thoughtful consideration of the inconveniences and advantages of a universal decree.\"--Thomas Jefferson, Commonplace Book (quoting with approval Cesare Beccaria from his work On Crimes and Punishment)\n \n \"Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Government's purposes are beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil-minded rulers. The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding.\"--United States Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis",

Additionally, throughout the south Klan sympathizers passed \"black codes\" which forbade blacks from possessing arms. These injustices led Congress to propose the 14th. Amendment, which had as a stated purpose the protection of the black man's Second Amendment RKBA.\n \n The NRA, on the other hand, was charted in 1871 by an act of the New York state legislature. The charter was granted at the request of a group of former Union army veterans who founded the NRA. Contrary to Klan goals, the NRA has never supported any disarmament of citizens based upon race.\n \n At approximately the same time the NRA was chartered in New York, Congress passed (in the 1870-71 legislative sessions) what became known as the \"enforcement acts,\" which effectively outlawed the Klan. This is a known fact which BfC CORRECTLY cites. What BfC deliberately chooses to ignore, however, is what happened AFTER the laws were passed:\n \n These acts were signed into law by President Ulysess S. Grant. Grant was no friend of the Klan, and was instead hailed as \"a humane conqueror and the benefactor of an enslaved and despised race, a race who will ever cherish a grateful remembrance of his name, fame and great services . . . . \" - Henry O. Wagoner, from a letter to Frederick Douglass. The \"enforcement acts\" acts empowered President Grant to suspend the right of Habeas Corpus and to use the military of the United States to suppress the Klan. Suppress it he did, and by 1872 the Klan was effectively crushed (only to rise again when it was later ignored). \n \n Among the significant events in the early fight against the Klan was the decision made by Union army general Phillip Sheridan to remove from office the Governors of Texas and Louisiana for impeding efforts to destroy the Klan.\n \n How does this history of Klan suppression by Grant and Sheridan relate to the NRA? After Grant left the presidency, the membership of the NRA elected him to be the 8th. President of that organization. When Grant finished his term as NRA president, the membership of the NRA elected General Phillip Sheridan it's 9th. President. In fact, eight of the first ten NRA presidents were veterans of the Union army. \n \n Is it possible that the NRA has since that time been secretly infiltrated by Klansmen? I tend to doubt it. Gun control has always been a tool of racism, and there would be no purpose for Klansmen to join an organization which has consistently promoted ownership of firearms by all citizens regardless of race. If they chose to join anyway, then wouldn't they have left in disgust in 1957, when they were unable to prevent the NRA leadership from actively helping a group of black men in Monroe, N.C. form an NRA chartered shooting club? After all, the avowed purpose in forming the club was to use the charter status to obtain military surplus firearms so it's black members could defend themselves against Klan attacks. What reason would Klansmen have to feel welcome in an organization that helped give blacks the ability to shoot back the next time they decided to \"hood up\"? However, if this wasn't enough to drive Klansmen away, then surely they would have left when Charlton Heston became NRA president. After all, they would never be able to forgive or forget his civil rights legacy. They would angrily remember him answering the call to work tirelessly with Dr. King to break the color barrier in Hollywood. The would bitterly remember him marching with Dr. King, and they would plug their ears whenever other NRA members fondly recalled his passionate appeals for recognition of the same black civil rights they had for years tried to suppress. While these Klansmen's trucks may sport a white hood draped over the gun rack, you will not see them proudly displaying the famous NRA bumper sticker proclaiming that their president was Charlton Heston. \n \n In short, the NRA never has been, and I believe never will be, a haven for Klansmen. Klansmen may use guns, but that does not make them friends of the NRA anymore than using a burning cross makes them friends of the Pope. BfC is certainly free to suggest all it wants that the NRA was coincidentally formed the same year the Klan was outlawed (1871), and it can deliberately try to give the uninformed the clear impression that the Klan and the NRA are linked in some fashion. We call that free speech. There is a saying, however, that \"if you are going to be stupid, then you've got to be tough.\" If MM is going to be stupid enough to try and deliberately create a false impression of history, then he's got to be tough enough to take the pounding he's getting now that he has been caught.\n \n -------------------------\n \n \"False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advantages for one imaginary or trifling inconvenience; that would take fire from men because it burns, and water because one may drown in it; that has no remedy for evils, except destruction. The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity, the most important of the code, will respect the less important and arbitrary ones, which can be violated with ease and impunity, and which, if strictly obeyed, would put an end to personal liberty--so dear to men, so dear to the enlightened legislator--and subject innocent persons to all the vexations that the guilty alone ought to suffer? Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man. They ought to be designated as laws not preventative but fearful of crimes, produced by the tumultuous impression of a few isolated facts, and not by thoughtful consideration of the inconveniences and advantages of a universal decree.\"--Thomas Jefferson, Commonplace Book (quoting with approval Cesare Beccaria from his work On Crimes and Punishment)\n \n \"Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Government's purposes are beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil-minded rulers. The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding.\"--United States Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis\n\n \n I think it naive to believe there are not people who belong to both the NRA and KKK.\n \n http://www.stormfront.org/forum/showthread.php?t=14639\n \n http://www.stormfront.org/forum/showthread.php?t=158130&highlight=nra+membership",

Why wouldn't Klansmen be welcome?\n\n \n Because the NRA does not support the Klan's white supremacy agenda. Their racist views are not welcome. The Klan can try all it wants to mainstream itself by propagandizing the firearm rights ideology you quoted above, but does anyone here really believe that they would support a public policy goal of placing more firearms into the hands of black Americans? I've seen the web pages you reference. They are not the only ones our state agencies track to monitor these fools. They think they can remain anonymous by not using their real names, and it is the false belief in their anonymity that gives them the courage to say any manner of stupid things. They can claim all they want to represent the NRA, but I don't believe that claim any more than I believe the \"facts\" they make up to justify their calls for a racial holy war. The majority of these fools rant against the NRA because the NRA ignores their positions and is \"too soft\" for them. If there are NRA members who are closet Klansmen, then they comprise a very small and ineffectual minority. \n \n Michael Moore attempted to associate the NRA with the Klan in BfC. Some people will believe it is true because they want to believe it. Others will not really believe it but will prove very happy to use the taint of the claimed association to discredit the NRA. After all, it is an old debate trick to discredit your opponent's views by associating them with the views of a universally acknowledged extremist group or person. Yet \"similar ideology\" arguments are almost always intentionally deceptive, and, as Michael Moore proved, they often have no foundation in reality.\n \n Consider, for example, these analogies: If you look hard enough at history you can find many Black Panther members who called for black men to exercise their right to arm themselves with a firearm. Does that mean that the NRA shares the same ideology of both the Black Panther movement and the Klan? I think not. The NRA and the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence have a remarkably similar ideology regarding teaching kids what to do if they find an unsecured gun. Each organization teaches essentially the same message of \"stop, don't touch, go tell an adult.\" Does this mean that contributors to the CPHGV should feel welcome wandering the floor at the next NRA annual convention? I think not. How many times have you heard the term \"feminazi\" used to describe the leadership of NOW? I doubt our friend Kickin50 would agree the association of feminism and National Socialism to be a valid analogy. Haven't you seen people on my side of the gun debate attempt to equate gun control proponents with National Socialism by quoting Hitler's support for gun control? Does that mean Sarah Brady would have felt welcome behind the podium at the Nuremburg NAZI party rally? I think not. The Brady Campaign supports the position that convicted felons should not be permitted to possess firearms. I share that particular ideology. Does that mean I should feel welcome in their organization? I doubt it. I have a Muslim friend who worships Allah, but I know he would feel very unwelcome if Osama and his group tried to recruit him. The Pope wears a cross on a chain around his neck, but I trust he would feel most unwelcome at a Klan event that hijacked his symbol of Christianity and burned it to terrorize others. Similarly, I'm a member of the NRA, but I would not feel welcome if I were invited to attend a Klan rally even if the fools who invited me said \"hey, were going to exercise our RKBA and bring our guns along for the midnight light show.\"",

   "I can understand that Mike Moore's message was anti-media, anti-government, anti-U.S. culture, anti-gun... whatever... Regardless, in my opinion, its intent was to instill fear in the viewers. I think he is part of the problem. Mr. Moore could have done a better job if he would have presented the issue more logically. But his agenda doesn't allow him to do this. For example... Everything can kill you... I'm sure a child has died from swallowing a cotton ball. Should we regulate cotton balls more? Of course not... Why? The benefits of cotton balls outweigh the problems they create. The same can be applied to handguns... I don't know exactly how you'd determine if handguns are more beneficial than they are harmful, but, that's more accurate than 'guns with the intent to kill people are bad.' In his movie, he said 11,000+ people were killed by guns in America. But, does that include people protecting themselves? Were 5,000 of the people killed trying to rape someone's daughter? And, how many lives were saved by handguns? If more than 11,000+ lives were saved by handguns, then GOD BLESS THE HANDGUN!!! A handgun is nothing more than a tool. Just like a cotton ball or a nuclear weapon. The questions: Does a cotton ball help the average individual more than it hurts him? Yes. Does a nuclear weapon help an average individual more than it hurts him? No. Does a handgun help an average individual more than it hurts him? The answer to his question determines what the regulations on handguns should be.",

   "I'm new. Love the thread.\n \n For the person who pointed out that there was editing: please, watch it again. When Moore is trying to verbally trash Heston over the little girl, there are 2 major problems (I edit film.)\n \n 1) He yells at Charlton Heston, who turns and it appears he has left. Then, Moore goes into the diatribe again, and you see Heston again. Moore is in a different position. To catch him in both positions, you need 2 (two) different cameramen to shoot the shots if they are as close as he would have you believe. You would see the first in downhill as the first film is shot - and the second uphill as the 2nd film is shot. There is one cameraman. He moves. This is called EDITING\n \n 2) Look at the shadows in the clip; Heston's are consistent with continuous walking away; same length with the sun, etc.. Moore's are not; one is obviously later. They move: different shadow in his second clip. So, editing again. Moore did the second screamfest after Heston was inside and made it appear as if he was still ignoring him.\n ------------------------\n BTW, did anyone notice where the little boy got the gun? Mom was moving. He was staying with his uncle, a crack dealer. Hello, if his uncle is dealing crack (around a child no less), is he going to hide his gun? Not likely. Would it be unloaded. Not likely. Also, the little boy had been a constant trouble maker in school................ Is this \"saintly\" child gong to ignore this life he is brought up in. And, for the record, MM was brought up in a ritzy suburb, not the city of, Flint, MI.",
