Children or passers by are slapped or otherwise mugged by one or more of a gang while others record the event on video and then distribute it by phone or Internet.\n Initially the attacks were, as the phrase would have us believe, fairly minor pranks ... As the craze spread the attacks became more vicious - often serious assaults known in legal circles as grievous bodily harm.\n \n Happy slapping - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",

The abuser is someone who believes this when it is convenient for him and without any consideration for women around. In Mexico, it is very curious that machistas have their mothers in a very high esteem, and treat their wives the opposite. So, in this case, the concept machista only applies whenever it is convienent for them to do so. In cases as this, even the definition of a Machista is difficult.\n\n Mexican Culture: Machista, machista, differance\n \n Machista?\n \nExaggerated pride in masculinity, perceived as power, often coupled with a minimal sense of responsibility and disregard of consequences. In machismo there is supreme valuation of characteristics culturally associated with the masculine and a denigration of characteristics associated with the feminine. It has for centuries been a strong current in Latin American politics and society. Caudillos (military dictators), prominent in the history of Latin America, have typified machismo with their bold and authoritarian approach to government and their willingness to employ violence to achieve their ends.\n\n Machista definition of Machista in the Free Online Encyclopedia.",
