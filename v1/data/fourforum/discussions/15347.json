   "California takes hard look at BB, pellet guns | Visalia Times-Delta and Tulare Advance-Register | visaliatimesdelta.com\n \n \nt's four years away, but Bill Jordan had every intention of buying his 4-year-old son a Red Ryder BB gun for his eighth birthday. But that gift wish may end soon if the Red Ryder goes from its unmistakable wood stock to a bright pink.\n \n California Senate Bill 798 has made it over two hurdles &#8212; a Public Safety Committee vote in March and a vote last week by state senators &#8212; and now heads to the Assembly, where it will be scrutinized and argued.\n \n The bill, if approved, would require all imitation guns to be painted a bright yellow, blue, pink or orange or made translucent.\n \n The bill was proposed by state Sen. Kevin de Leon, D-Los Angeles, and inspired after a boy was shot in Los Angeles in December, after police mistook his BB gun for a deadly firearm.\n \n While opinions in Sacramento differ, so do those locally. Supporters of SB 798 say it's a way of saving lives. Gun enthusiasts say the law goes too far.\n \n \"I had a Red Ryder when I was 8 years old and I want my son to have the same,\" said Jordan, as he left the Visalia Walmart where he'd looked for oil for his gun. \"It's not right; it's not the way it's supposed to be. A gun is supposed to look like a gun.\"\n \n Others agree.\n \n Dwight Chaddock, vice president of the Southern Tulare County Sportsman's Association, says it's an attack on the National Rifle Association, the Second Amendment and those who lawfully own and use guns.\n \n He has five children and several grandchildren. Each of his children had a BB gun by the time they were 7 or 8, he says. He's purchased a Red Ryder for all but two of his grandchildren.\n \n \"This is just another way bleeding-heart liberals are screwing up America,\" he said. \"Guns aren't supposed to be bright orange. A bright-colored gun doesn't prepare kids for what a real gun will do.\"\n \n Law enforcement says the bill may help them do their job better. Tulare police Sgt. Darron Altermatt says he's been confronted several times by a suspect holding a BB or pellet gun. He's had to make a quick decision whether the gun was real. He's always guessed right. But a bright pink or translucent gun would have made it easier, he said.\n \n \"Some of these airsoft guns look pretty realistic. It can be hard to tell,\" he said. \"Anything to make things safer for law enforcement and the people on the street is a benefit.\"\n \n Chaddock begs to differ.\n \n \"Anyone stupid enough to use a BB gun to hold up a store and then confront police deserves what he gets,\" he said. \"I don't know if you get dumber.\"\n \n Paul Garsta, who manages ACE Guns in Tulare, said he also agrees the bill is a good idea, but gun education is key to keeping people safe. He says BB guns, pellet guns and airsoft guns educate children.\n \n \"These kids learn that these guns, just like real guns, will penetrate flesh,\" he said. \"They learn that if it can kill a bird, it can kill other things, and learn from that.\"\n \n The law wouldn't change guns that were made or purchased before the law was passed.\n\n \n BB guns and air rifles aren't toys and can't be considered as such, not when they're capable of being used to hunt game with and do actual damage to property, animals and people. As such they shouldn't be painted to look like the toys that they aren't. That's suggesting they're less potentially dangerous than they are, and are actually safe to play around with like you're an idiot.\n \n In New York we had Bloomberg trying to ban brightly colored guns, and in California we've got the state trying to mandate recognized weapons be colored like toys.",

   "Well if California is full of stupid people that would confront the police with a BB gun and brandish it in a dangerous manner then they deserve to be shot. The state shouldn't be bending over backwards to try and prevent these societal wastes from getting themselves killed while committing criminal actions.\n \n If you don't want your kids to risk getting shot by the police then don't let them have a BB gun. And if they're old enough to know better but do it anyway then that's their fault. Make it illegal to brandish an imitation firearm instead. If they get shot they won't do it again, and if they don't then they can be charged with a crime and prosecuted. Nobody's doing them any favors by enforcing a neon pink standard on air rifles.",

   "So let's take a minute to look at California. According to some of Sinjin's previous comments:\n [*]Plenty of thugs in his neighborhood have TEC-9 pistols, which are illegal under state law.

And all in the state of California with its strict firearm laws. Doesn't look very much like it's working out the way they hoped it would.\n \n As I said if you've got brats who are brandishing BB guns and threatening the police then they deserve what they got.

That's suggesting they're less potentially dangerous than they are, and are actually safe to play around with like you're an idiot.\n\n Wait wait wait what? I've got three airsoft guns, and the bloody things can't penetrate skin at point blank! Shot myself a full burst into the thigh by accident once, and the worst I've ever heard to happen in the entire airsoft comminity of the country was a tooth chipped/knocked out (reports differ). Even the most \"overclocked\" ones that cost as much as a real gun in upgrades only perhaps double the range, and that's still not going to cause more than simple bleeding. PAINTBALL HURST WORSE THAN AIRSOFT, for god's sake... The ticks in the woods are a greater threat than those guns...\n \n Now, ball bearing guns, maybe, but not airsoft ones that are specifically designed to not penetrate flesh.\n \n The issue is that they, on purpose, look as close to real weapons as possible at all - that's the whole point. People spends hundreds of dollars worth to add metal parts to make them feel more authentic. Of course this means that you keep them out of sight when not on the field - and freeze solid if you see the blue of a police uniform until one can very carefully explain to them that they can shoot you with the \"gun\" if they really want to make sure, but please from more that 10 feet away.\n \n Problem with marking them as non-weapons with orange tips is that it's kinda hard to play a game then. Fully camouflaged, well hidden - and then you have to use a neon bright piece in your arms? Might as well give up on anything invovling camouflage...\n \n No, here, I'm fully in favor of airsoft guns being as they are, with the understanding that you'll have to be extra careful not have the gun be mistaken for a real one, which could lead to getting shot by the police.",
