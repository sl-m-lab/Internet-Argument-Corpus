   "I feel that I would Have to disagree with your notion that the use of these \"mini-nukes\" would bring back the larger nucular missles. For one thing the U.N. would never agree to it.\n\n \n The U.N. wouldn't have to agree to anything concerning larger nukes. Lets say that the US and China go to war the US lands several mini nukes along the Chinese coast to take out it's naval forces. China is already weak navally compared to the US so they have only two options of striking back at US based locations. The first is to attatch mini nukes to ICBMs to hit our positions or to launch strategic nukes with those same ICBMs. Basically the US will have legally hit China with mini nuclear weapons and China will feel that they have a legal right to strike back with nuclear weapons of their own. This is how the legal use of mini nukes can lead to the use of larger and illegal nukes.\n \n \nThere are too many nations that don't hold Nucular power and to them it would be an unfair advantage.\n\n \n It is already unfair with larger and more powerful countries having far stronger conventional weapons. Are you going to try and debate that we should restrict countries uses on stronger conventional weapons because they are unfair to use against weaker nations ie Iraq?\n \n \nSecond of all, the clip itself said that the mini-nuke had only a kiliton thing-a-ma-bobber of 5 kilitons while the Triton Nukes(modern nucular missles) have kiliton averages of 450 kilitons.\n\n \n The mini nukes are currently small and expensive to make. They are not all that practical to even use. The main purpose of using them would be the fear they will create. Opposing armies will have to march in radiation suits in certain situations which is expensive in itself not to mention the moral hit that opposing armies will take when a mini nuke is used against them. Seeing a mushroom cloud of any size is going to strike fear into the hearts of entire armies. So even if our MOAB is larger than the theoretical mini nukes I think the mini nukes will still have a powerful purpose.\n \n \nThe U.N. would probably be more leniant towards these mini-nukes than the larger nukes because they are not as strong.\n\n \n I have no doubt that they will be. My fear is that the use of a 1kt mini nuke will make the response from an enemy a 2kt nuke. The response to that will be 4kt nuke. There will always be room to one up your enemy in a mini nuke battle and I would expect that the smaller country would be more than willing to do this. In a conventional war there would be only room to either continue fighting on the conventional level or go straight to full nuclear attack. That is a much tougher jump to make than a steady increase of nuclear attacks throughout a war IMO. I think this is where we would see larger and larger nuclear weapons getting used because mini nukes get used.",

We have more resources than any other country to accomplish this and it would be extremely useful in the case of war to control of of the satellites above the earth.",
