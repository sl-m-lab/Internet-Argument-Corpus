   "In time when the world worried about international financial and economy crisis the leaders of country (USA) which is a guilty of it are continuing to talk profusely about importance of democracy spreading in the world and ask their European allies to continue their support of territorial integrity and the AMERICAN TYPE ROTTEN DEMOCRACY in f*cking Georgia! Oh, I think that USA as a empire have had its day! I now think that Europe need to keep it own way rather than follow the way of American aggression if we don't need to repeat the way of country which budgeted deficit is $1 trillion! And financial instability guides to full collapse of national currency! Look, it's clear that our position for solving such crisis situation must differ from martial US' dictates. And Sarkozy is right that Europe need to set the pattern by keeping the peace as it had been shown by France president in Georgia. Moreover we need to show Russia that we need not only energy delivering but common future with Russia too. And we should be supportive of Sarkozy's idea to develop not only partnership relations but construct common free market zone with Russia too!",

   "Hey! I think that should be making little wonder that the few previous weeks' trend of rising oil prices (though slowly but still rising) does not suit the USA. This being so, it is useless to argue that oil price drop is generally a result of lack of stability in the world. One can therefore contend Washington to be interested in global instability and oil prices staying low. Do you catch the idea? Perhaps now you understand who exactly is standing behind all those recent disorders in Europe. For instance, campus unrest in Greece that turned the country in hell! Yep, US secret services know very well how to trigger civil unrest and frame up various provocations. So, for example a failed attempt of a terror act in a French store Printemps Haussmann (where five explosive bombs were disclosed) and powder mailings to US embassies in Germany and Romany were also deliberately organized by US secret services to cause general destabilization to make oil prices drop.",

Here's a particular case of Belarus. It was just a year or so ago that all European politicians accused regime of Lukashenko of being undemocratic, named him \"the last Europe's dictator\" and oppressor of the Belarusian opposition. But as soon as there were plans for construction of part of Nabucco in Belarus, we all smoothly put all Lukashenko's wrong-doings out of mind. Now we offer Belarus cooperation with the EU as part of Eastern Partnership project. Surely, now we need Lukashenko, we beam to him and wheedle. We say, OK, he is an oppressor but he will give us gas! For gas we will forgive him just everything! But what will we achieve in the end? When Lukashenko feels the impunity he would just wipe up Belarusian opposition right away! Who's going to be blamed for that? For sure that got to be EU.
