   "Be proud of wealth inequality:\n \n http://www.rossputin.com/blog/index.php/a/2006/12/06/be_proud_of_wealth_inequality\n\n Hmm, I always find articles and studies about wealth distribution to be factually incorrect because they don't take debt into account when deciding who is \"rich\".\n This article is no exception, just look at the part about 82% of American households being in the richest 10%.\n Those households have massive debt in the form of mortgages, car loans, creditcard debt etc. And last time I checked the savings rate in the US was negative.\n \n I consider a poor schmuck in Bangladesh who, after all expenses are payed, earns $5,- per month to be \"richer\" than the SUV family who have more debt than income each month.\n \n \n As for the other article, well frankly it's poo. Don't get me wrong, the article is well meant, but poo nonetheless. It's a collection of facts about being poor which most of us already know. You can just sum up the article in a couple of sentences:\n - being poor sucks\n - the poor are everywhere\n - bad or no education almost guarantee poverty\n - poverty can cause crime\n - bad economy results in poverty\n - appreciate what you have\n \n Like I said, the article is well meant, but still poo.\n \n I'm still not quite sure what you are trying to discuss by posting these articles.",
