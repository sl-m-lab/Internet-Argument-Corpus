   "From \"The Epistle of St. Ignatius of Antioch to the Magnesians\", (written a few hundred years before the Bible was compiled)\n \n 2:1 Since, therefore, I have been deemed worthy to behold you through Damas, your bishop, who is worthy of God, and your worthy presbyters Bassus and Apollonius, and my fellow-servant the Deacon Sotion, of whom may I have joy, because he is subject to the bishop as to the grace of God, and to the presbytery as to the law of Jesus Christ.\n \n 3:1 And you it beseemeth not to despise the youth of your bishop, but to award all reverence unto him, respecting the power of God the Father which is in him, even as I have known the sacred presbyters to do, not having regard to his apparently youthful position, but as wise men in God yielding unto him: yet not unto him but unto the Father of Jesus Christ, who is bishop of all.\n \n 3:2 It is therefore right that we should obey without any hypocrisy, to the honour of him who hath willed that we should do so; since not only doth a man deceive the visible bishop, but he also sets at nought the invisible one. But he who doeth such things has to give an account not unto the flesh, but unto God, who knoweth the secret things.\n \n It says that Jesus is the Bishop of all... that is, the head of the church. But quite clearly individuals such as Damas are bishops in his stead, in particular jurisdictions. Further, he urges obedience to this bishop... a visible bishop (of a visible church). Further, this bishop carries in him the power of God. This is, that power that has been handed down to him, through the Apostles, who received it from the Holy Spirit at Pentecost.\n \n \n For the first three hundred years of its history, the Church lived without the Bible. Right from day one people started to interpret Christ's message for themselves. The first recorded person is Simon Magus, who sought to buy the gifts of the Holy Spirit from the Apostles. He failed to do so, but followed Peter to Rome to preach his own version of events. Further, Paul kept calling people back to unity.\n \n Thus there were issues over what was orthodox doctrine. How did they cope with heresies? There was no Bible to quote from. Instead, the early church relied on tradition. They said 'what is the teachings of Christ that we have carried with us?\". Certainly there were individual manuscripts (as exampled above), but by the late third century there were hundreds such books. Which should they quote from as being genuine and true to their teachings? Which were so important that they should come together into a Bible... and which were secondary in importance?\n \n The church sat together and guided by the Holy Spirit chose which books to put into the Bible.\n \n To non-traditionalist Christians, \n If you don't believe that the Holy Spirit was with the Church in doing this, then how do you rest any authority in the Bible? Is it that the Bible just wrote itself?\n \n If you do believe that the Holy Spirit was with the Church, and thus the Bible is authoritative, then why do you believe that the Holy Spirit is no longer with the Church? Where did Jesus go wrong? After all he established this church that chose the Bible. At what time an date did the Holy Spirit leave the Church? Was it 2am 19th July 545AD?\n \n Without these churchmen you despise, you'd have no Bible!\n \n Recall also that these churchmen wrote books in those intervening 300 years. They elaborated on doctrine, and belief. To just go by what is in the Bible, is to pluck one book out of the context of the Church that gave us the Bible. The context of the Bible is not the Bible itself, it is the Church. The Church existed before the Bible and 'created' it - not the other way around!\n \n Remember (John 14:18, 26) \"I will not leave you desolate; I will come to you... But the Counsellor, the Holy Spirit, Whom the Father will send in My Name, He will teach you all things and bring to you remembrance all that I have said to you.\" Jesus commissioned his Apostles. And they had the guide in the Holy Spirit.\n \n But did they need to write everything down? John concludes his Gospel (John 21:25) by saying \"And there are also many other things which Jesus said, the which, if they should be written everyone, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain\n the books that should be written. Amen.\" Further (I Thes 4:1-2) \"We beseech you brothers, and exhort you by the\n Lord Jesus, that as you have received of us how you ought to walk and to please God, so you would abound more and more ... For you know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.\" \n \n Also, if it weren't for the early church making decisions, we'd all still be forbidden from eating pork! Furthermore, no Gentile would have been converted! In Acts there is a group discussion about how to interpret Jesus' message - should it be for Jews only, or for all man? They decided to take the word of God to all man. Jesus had empowered them to make such decisions. And they did!\n \n For Orthodox, we don't discount the Bible. \"Among the elements which make up the Holy Tradition of the Church, the Bible holds the first place. Next comes the Church's liturgical life and its prayer, then its dogmatic decisions and the acts of its approved churchly councils, the writings of the church fathers, the lives of the saints, the canon laws, and finally the iconographic tradition together with the other inspired forms of creative artistic expression such as music and architecture. All of the elements of Holy Tradition are organically linked together in real life. None of them stands alone. None may be separated or isolated from the other or from the wholeness of the life of the Church. All come alive in the actual living of the life of the Church in every age and generation, in every time and place. As the Church continues to live by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, the Holy Tradition of the Church will continue to grow and develop. This process will go on until the establishment of the Kingdom of God at the end of the ages.\"\n http://www.oca.org/pages/orth_chri/orthodox-faith/doctrine/tradition.html\n \n Yet Calvin believed that every human is, ultimately wicked. Yet he said that he entrusted them with their own source of salvation -that is, it was up to them to have a personal understanding of the Bible. How could inherently wicked people realise what was good? Protestants believe that they can't achieve salvation through their own efforts, yet through their own efforts can determine how to interpret scripture to achieve proof of salvation.",

Protestants believe that they can't achieve salvation through their own efforts, yet through their own efforts can determine how to interpret scripture to achieve proof of salvation.\n\n \n First let me say I am not calvinist. I would like to however show you that they make a compeling argument from scripture.\n \n Ephesians 2\n 1 And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;\n 2 Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:\n 3 Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.\n 4 But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,\n 5 Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)\n 6 And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:\n 7 That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.\n 8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:\n 9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.\n \n A Presbyterian pastor once explained it to me like this. A dead man can do nothing. The Bible is replete with references to man being dead in sin. If we are dead to the things of God then God must first regenerate man then allow him to believe. Calvinists believe this man is the elect. Other religions have different terms. I being a Baptist believe every man is given this opportunity, not only the elect. We call them divine appointments. Every man on earth will choose to believe Jesus was the Christ and savior of the sins or deny and receive death. Calvinists use this ideal behind the entirety of the five points. I explained to this pastor at the close of our discussion, \"Almost thou persuadest me to be a presbyterian.\"",

As we individually do this it is amazing the unity of the church. There is disunity within the catholic church. I would say the orthodox as well but frankly don't know that much there. Disunity is not based on whether or not we agree on doctrine or dogma. \n \n Unity is also not that. Jesus prayed for our unity. Not the church's unity mind you but the unity of individuals. Not that they would not disagree, but that they would seek the Father through Him. This is how unity is accomplished. It is not by directly trying to be unified and thereby imposing an organizational structure from the outside in. It is the transformation of individual believers from the inside out that will lead to unity in the Church.",
