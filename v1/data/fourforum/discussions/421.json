I accept that when our leadership has failed that also it is the best possible outcome that could have been achived in more than 12 years of diplomacy. I ask for God's forgiveness that I will support the death of many innocent Iraqi men, women, and children.

If he were to succede in giving NBCWs to any terrorist the next smoking gun would be another smoking American City. This is the right thing to do, no comprimise on our way of life. We will not change to make terrorist, and terrorist nations happy, they will die before we change. I say to hell with Sadam and all people who would threaten our nation.",
