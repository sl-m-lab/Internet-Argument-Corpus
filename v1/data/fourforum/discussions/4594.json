   "What's European poster and national opinion on current US foreign policy of democratizing ME nations using intimidation and if necessary force? \n\n \n I don`t like it. The actions of the US threatens the idea of non-aggression and the sanctity of soverignity. To be frank, I`d rather let my politicians gamble away the soverignity of my country than to let american politicians snuff it out. \n \n Another aspect is that the relatively high level of international respect and status my country currently enjoys is based on our commitment to the UN, with US actions eroding the percieved legitimacy of UN, they also erode our international status. Which is a worrysome development from my point of view.\n \n EDIT: Oh, and everyone hates the US over here now. Honestly, they do. It is almost scary... Even the most serious US supporters and admireers have changed their position... \n \n \nHow has this affected foreign affair policy conducted by EU nations regarding those nations targeted by the US for reforms?\n\n \n Apparantly we are now willing sending egyptian fugitives to egyptian torture chambers as long as the US asks (or demands) us to.

   "The interesting thing for me is the way that the US actions have made the US very unpopular with European populace at large, even in the countries that supported the War, for example the last time that GW Bush visited the UK over 50,000 people demonstrated against his visit. At the end of the demonstration a effigy of Bush was toppled to the ground in the exact same way that the Statue of Saddam was toppled in Iraq.\n \n Now this doesn't sound like a lot of people but usually those sorts of demos only attract a few hundred people at most, and those demos are usually attended by the usual crowd such as the Left wingers and Anti-Globalisation people, at this demo you had church leaders, old people and some Conservatives as well.\n \n Now another problem I have is that the  Special Relationship between the UK and the US only seems to go one way, we support the US but when we want to push something through in the World Stage the US blocks it, for example the Global Warming Problem and the recent measures to protect certain of Worlds Forests. Now I realise that the UK is very much the junior partner but you think there would be some sort of back up from the US on those issues.",

If the EU continued a formal embargo at US insistence, it'll just go through a back door such as Russia or other Asian nations with the same results.

I was talking about the historical factors contributing to the economic disaster and hence the rise of Nazism.

It became apparent through the depression, and the events leading up tot he depression, that the governments laze fair policies regarding business were a failure. Social programs were ntot he greatest legacy of FDR, thought hey are the most publiclty visible. FDR started p[ushign for, and getting, and handing down a legacy, of government control over business where there had previously been very little. \n \n The problem with this is that once the precedent was set fo the governemtn to take a heavy handed approach to business management they, as usual, went overboard. Now we have a system of complete oversigt. The private sectors solution to this was to start buying up politicians wholesale. Now we end up in a situation where big business is no longer encumbered with pointless governemtn regs....their bought and paid for politicians ensure this, but we have stripped competition by ensuring that smaller frims who cannot afford to purchase a busload of senators are unable to compete.\n \n FDRs social programs, as envisioned and enacted at the time, were just common sense. We had a nation full of starving people. As a result, crime was through the roof. We saved a lot of money as a nation by instituting those programs. The cost saved in law enforcement alone was more than enoguh to offset the costs of the programs.\n \n Since then, I would certainly agree that they have gotten out of control in many respects. Blaming Roosevelt, whose social programs were actually fairly conservative, hardly seems fair.",

   "I think it goes FAR, FAR beyond just the great unwashed masses suffereing. It became apparent through the depression, and the events leading up tot he depression, that the governments laze fair policies regarding business were a failure. Social programs were ntot he greatest legacy of FDR, thought hey are the most publiclty visible. FDR started p[ushign for, and getting, and handing down a legacy, of government control over business where there had previously been very little. \n\n \n Agreed, with exceptions. While the government took a more hand's off approach to business under Coolidge, it also ended over a decade farm subsidies which crippled large numbers of farmers that the government had encouraged to modernize during the war. The cut off of subsidies left them with huge debts and no means of paying them off.\n The government was also extremely active in attempting to prevent importation through measures such as the Smoot Hawley Tariff of 1930, which had the net effect of decreasing both imports and exports to Europe. They weren't going to trade with the US under unfair conditions.\n \n\n The problem with this is that once the precedent was set fo the governemtn to take a heavy handed approach to business management they, as usual, went overboard. Now we have a system of complete oversigt. The private sectors solution to this was to start buying up politicians wholesale. Now we end up in a situation where big business is no longer encumbered with pointless governemtn regs....their bought and paid for politicians ensure this, but we have stripped competition by ensuring that smaller frims who cannot afford to purchase a busload of senators are unable to compete.\n \n FDRs social programs, as envisioned and enacted at the time, were just common sense. We had a nation full of starving people. As a result, crime was through the roof. We saved a lot of money as a nation by instituting those programs. The cost saved in law enforcement alone was more than enoguh to offset the costs of the programs.\n \n Since then, I would certainly agree that they have gotten out of control in many respects. Blaming Roosevelt, whose social programs were actually fairly conservative, hardly seems fair.\n\n \n I don't think that they were characterized by opponents as \"fairly conservative\". The US Supreme Court ruled against FDR's New Deal 3 times before it got out of the gate. As a result, FDR attempted what became known as his \"court packing\" scheme in an attempt to railroad the SCOTUS to accept unconstitutional programs.\n No, my contempt for FDR is well-founded. :xcensored :xcensored",

It looks like you are the one who did poorly on reading comprehension. SO I REPREAT , I WAS NOT COMPARING THE CONDITIONS IN GERMANY TO THE US DURING THE DEPRESSION. ( I hope this is clear enough for you)\n \n 2) The public at large did not know about Roosevelt's disability...infact the media only printed photos of him waist up and never revealed his disability to the public at large when he was president or before he ran for president.. So your theory about his party choosing him to run for president because of his disabiity is a falsehood. The fact that he was the then governer of New York had more to do with it.

   "New highly profitable business for the chosen ones: political asylum to wealthy criminals\n \n \n Is it really all the rage to grant political asylum to various rascals and criminals who constitute a menace to their country's security or first skunk their country out of millions of dollars and after that cop a heel to escape prison? \n For the price of significant redemption, high ranks at US secret services helped the most wanted terrorist Osama Bin Laden disappear in the Pakistani mountains, safeguarded security of his family and conveyed them to Saudi Arabia in a supersonic airplane. \n MI6 harboured Jewish oligarch Berezovsky who rubs elbows with Chechen terrorists known as polluters the best part of British capital with polonium 210. \n Now a beggar state of Czechia, whose budget is always hacked, upon authorization of London has gratefully accepted half of $230 mln from Russian banker Stashevsky. He had embezzled this sum of money that was laid out to him in 1997 to back up construction of MiG-29 aircraft for India. \n Criminal ring-leaders and top ranks of such secret services like CSI and MI6 work in tandem so that one should not expect impartial recompense for crimes of the century.\n\n \n \n Must be a full moon tonight. All of the loonies are coming out of the woodwork.\n \"This is a public announcement: STAY AWAY FROM THE BROWN ACID!\"",

   "I don't believe our (U.S.) aims are to spread democracy, especially in the Middle East. The only real argument in Iraq was the danger Saddam presented and we have to leave something behind. I agree democracy makes sense if the minorities can be assured of defense of liberty by the majority. In history, it is pretty rare that the majority will take the time to defend the minority to the exclusion of the liberal parties.\n \n We gave people living in forced camps the right to vote, and when they vote for an organization that wants to liberate them from the camps by all means necessary, we're shocked?\n \n If we really wanted to spread democracy, the Saudi's are begging for it. Course they hate the United States with a passion never seen before, but they want democracy. Do you think we'll arm the Royals?\n \n Iran has democracy, as much democracy has you can have in any church state. They have made it to our number one enemy. Egypt has some democracy as well and you can guess who they're voting in.",

   "US foreign policy is counter-productive in just about every way.\n The bottom line is that the US doesn't respect or really try to understand the other parties involved. The US has 'moral and cultural highground' syndrome, also known as 'arrogance'. This ****** people off.\n \n \n \n We (Americans) don't want to understand or repect the other parties involved. We want them dead. Let me connect the dots for you. 3,000 people of our people were killed in one morning. Instead of immediatly surrending like France or Spain would have done....oppps....Spain did immediatly surrender after they were attacked. I forgot. Anyway....instead of surrending we decided to go after the people responsible. Those people were:\n \n 1. The terrorist leaders in Afghanistan \n \n 2. Saddam who linked with those terrorist leaders. We no have proof of that by the way. \n \n Sorry we didn't stop to consider your feelings or try to understand  how France, Germany and Russia were making money illegally off of a genocidal mad man.\n\n \n The Terrorist leaders in Afghanistan saw us coming. They're doing fine.\n \n Saddam was secular to the point where he would not let the Sunni (The base Religion of AL Qeada) worship. We never did that and Saddam was their number one enemy. We helped AL Qeada by removing Saddam.\n \n We where making money off Saddam, he was trading in the dollar. Any country that wanted to do business with Same had to convert to our money. Saddam threatened to take the Euro. That would have hurt the United States. The number one Oil for Food criminal was a Texan.",

   "The Commission of the European Communities holds that Ukraine is the main supplier of imposters to EU.\n \n Holy God, you've just got it at last! I' really impressed by #### speed of decision-making of European politicians. Look, the cyberspace is riddled with information about illegal corridors of penetration at Europe territory via Ukraine but the fat is in the fire! Over 23 thousand of Chechen refugees and rebels came to Europe by Ukraine territory during last 5 years. But now this situation has been changed, EU got a sense the threat issuing from Chechens but Ukraine wised new task! \n It's not a secret now that the relationships between Georgia and Ukraine president are so close that Ukraine put the corridor for Georgian refuges for trip to Europe. Keep in the hopper that Georgia is a most crime rate region at the post Soviet area I'm afraid to think who cam come to Europe soon! Well, we need to set out the priorities and understand who and how penetrate the EU. And of course Europe needs to have a anchor to windward!",
