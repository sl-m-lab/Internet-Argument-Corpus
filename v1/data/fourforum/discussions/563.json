   "I tried to address the questions to issues that had been raised by other posters. I tried to ask questions that might be answered by evidence, if any such evidence exists. I tried to be logical and to the point. It seems that this was too much.\n \n So I'll take another tack. I'm going to ask questions that should be more to the liking of the creationists. I'm going to ask questions about mythology, superstition and magic.\n \n Assuming that you believe the Bible to be historically accurate in its description of creation, which creation story is correct; six days or Adam and Eve?\n \n Assuming that you believe in a global flood, where did the water come from and where did it go? The amount of additional water required to cover the earth to a depth 15 cubits above the highest mountains is many times more water than exists on earth.\n \n Assuming that much of the geologic record was laid down by the flood, exactly where is the boundry between flood strata and those laid down after the flood? Shouldn't this boundary be clear all over the globe, on land and in lakes and the oceans?",

What happened to all of the heat that would have been generated by all of that mountain building in such a short time? We are talking about events that happened only about 4500 years ago. Even today you can see the volcanos and earthquakes that results in mountain lifting that is barely dicernable. But you want to build Alps, Andes, Rockies, Himalayas and so on. The heat generated would not have had time to disipate.\n \n Sorry. The story of Noah's ark is mythology.",
