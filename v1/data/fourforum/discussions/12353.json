   "Biomimicry: Biomimicry (from bios, meaning life, and mimesis, meaning to imitate) is a new discipline that studies nature's best ideas and then imitates these designs and processes to solve human problems.\n \n The 15 Coolest Cases of Biomimicry\n 1. Velcro\n 2. Passive Cooling\n 3. Gecko Tape\n 4. Whalepower Wind Turbine\n 5. Lotus Effect Hydrophobia\n 6. Self-Healing Plastics\n 7. The Golden Streamlining Principle\n 8. Artificial Photosynthesis\n 9. Bionic Car\n 10. Morphing Aircraft Wings\n 11. Friction-Reducing Sharkskin\n 12. Diatomaceous Nanotech\n 13. Glo-Fish\n 14. Insect-Inspired Autonomous Robots\n 15. Butterfly-Inspired Displays\n \n What to expect from the future?\n In the case of solar fuel, we would do well to use design principles of the photosynthesis photosystem II mechanism to engineer our own solar fuel producing systems with similar efficiency.\n E.g.:\n Solar water-splitting into H2 and O2: design principles of photosystem II and hydrogenases\n Taking design principles from nature is like taking a look at the future of our own designs.\n \n And nanomotors?\n Design principles in biomolecular motors are already inspiring future designs.\n Clockwork That Drives Powerful Virus Nanomotor Discovered \n http://www.sciencedaily.com/images/2008/12/081224215530.jpg\n \nBecause of the motor's strength--to scale, twice that of an automobile--the new findings could inspire engineers designing sophisticated nanomachines.\n\n \n And what better place to manufacture these machines than the place where these machines are created in the first place. Intracellularly:\n Using Living Cells As Nanotechnology Factories\n \nScienceDaily (Oct. 8, 2008) - In the tiny realm of nanotechnology, scientists have used a wide variety of materials to build atomic scale structures. But just as in the construction business, nanotechnology researchers can often be limited by the amount of raw materials. Now, Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University researcher Hao Yan has avoided these pitfalls by using cells as factories to make DNA based nanostructures inside a living cell.\n\n \n Why not, with such optimal clockwork, error correction, efficient enzymes,  structures folding other structures into place, nanotubes etc. mimicking designs in nature for our own future designs seems like a good idea.\n \n Feel free to post more interesting designs in nature that can be used for our own future designs.",
