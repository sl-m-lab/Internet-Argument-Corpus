Last the public heard he was undergoing bankruptcy proceedings and ebing forced to sell his house becuase after being forced to resign he could not find a new job. I think we can reasonably assume that his academic credentials are shot and he will probably never teach again, unless maybe it is at the bumscape community college.\n \n \nIt all fairness, Lot is not the definitive study.

Anti-gunners are wrong. But hey the serve a good purpose, we need commies to point and laught at.\n\n \n I am not arguing that Lotts work is definitive as far as the whole body of research into gun violence goes. It is just one part of the whole picture. What I am saying is that we now have enough data to draw a reasonable conclusion, and taking the data into account, the only possible conclusion is that the social costs of gun ownership are negligeble. \n \n Also, since you mention Cook and Ludwig, I would laike to say that I find them refreshingly honest as far as anti gun researchers go. While most anti gunners are frankly liars, Cook and Ludwig, in their report on the effects of the Brady bill, showed refreshing honesty in not trying to doctor the numbers. Of course, we all knwo that the result of their work just told us what we alreayd knew, that there was no discernable effect on gun violence or suicide due to the enactment of the brady bill, and that the VPC is a bunch of lying scoundrels. Still, though, it was nice to see anti gunner who actually maintained some shred of honor in their work.",

He does make the claim that the gun lobby protected Lott, but does not offer any substantiating evidence. What it basically boils down to is he says \"A vast right wing conspiracy, of which I have no evidence, stepped in and interceded invisibly on Lotts behalf\".\n \n Aeems pretty unlikely to me. Seems much more likely that people recognised that the only part of Lotts work that was in question was a single line that was wholly unrelated to his actual work.

To claim that their work destroys the arguments of anti gunners would be equivalent to saying that the National Research Council's report destroys the Lott's arguments.
