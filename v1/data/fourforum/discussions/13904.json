I found this confusing and diffrent than what we have been told.\n   Amid Drug War, Mexico Less Deadly Than Decade Ago \nMexico City's homicide rate today is about on par with Los Angeles and is less than a third of that for Washington, D.C.\n \n Mexico City's rate was about 9 per 100,000 in 2008, while Washington, D.C. was more than 30 that year.\n\n But I thought it was the easy gun laws in the U.S. that made Mexico's cities a shooting gallery?

That has made Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas, among the most dangerous cities in the world.\n \n Mexico has the same problems with corrupt police, gang violence and poverty as other Latin American countries with higher homicide rates. So why the decline in murders?\n\n What is the REAL problem? Drugs, Gangs, and all of the corrupt police and government officials that drug money can buy.",

   "The real problem is your understanding of Mexico's geography. The drug wars take place on both sides of the US/Mexican border, not in the mountains of Mexico City. ;)\n\n Whew! Thank you for telling me that. It is only my understanding of Mexico's geography! I could have swore people were blaming our 2nd Amendment Rights for the problem! More directly the ease in which someone could purchase guns in America. \n \n Don't worry America! The 2nd Amendment is safe. No need for the  CIFTA treaty Obama talked about  that would effect our 2nd Amendment rights! \n \n It was only my understanding of Mexico's Geography! \n \n That is a load off my mind! Whew!\n \n   Central America: The FARC, the Contras and the Flow of Weapons \n The April 15 seizure of 218 weapons in Honduras has uncovered a major arms- and drug-smuggling network that moves weapons from Central America to Colombian militants by way of Honduras and the Colombian island of San Andres. Although Honduran government officials have hinted that the weapons came from the United States, they more likely originated with former U.S. Cold War allies in Nicaragua and El Salvador.\n \n The weapons, found inside a parked truck on the ranch, included 145 short-barrel M-16 assault rifles, 28 long-barrel M-16s, 26 Soviet-era AK-47 rifles, 11 U.S.-made M-60 machine guns, four FAL 7.62 mm assault rifles of unknown origin, nine grenade launchers for attachment to M-16s, 54 crates of ammunition totaling more than 50,000 rounds, and 374 ammunition clips for M-16 and AK-47 rifles.\n \n Police also seized what official government reports described variously as five \"rocket launchers\" and \"anti-tank rockets,\" though they likely were Soviet-made rocket-propelled grenades. Honduran Security Minister Oscar Alvarez, who said the weapons' serial numbers had been removed, hinted that they could have been smuggled into Honduras from the United States.\n \n These sources also said that the large number of M-16s suggest the original suppliers could have links to former U.S.-supplied forces in the region. Such forces include former members of El Salvador's military and former members of the Contras, the Nicaraguan guerrilla group that sought to topple Nicaragua's Sandinista regime in the 1980s.\n \n Central America's illegal arms market has flourished since the end of the Cold War left the region flooded with tens of thousands of assault rifles, handguns, machine guns, mortars and other weaponry. Many of these weapons have found their way into the hands of maras. However, Colombian militant groups, such as the FARC and the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, have been major arms shoppers in the region for years, swapping cocaine and heroin for weapons and ammunition.\n\n Mexico's Drug War: Mexico drug cartels&#8217; new weaponry means war - Los Angeles Times\n The Mexican government said it has seized 2,239 grenades in the last two years, in contrast to 59 seized over the previous two years.\n \n The enhanced weaponry represents a wide sampling from the international arms bazaar, with grenades and launchers produced by U.S., South Korean, Israeli, Spanish or former Soviet bloc manufacturers. Many had been sold legally to governments, including Mexico's, and then were diverted onto the black market. Some may be sold directly to the traffickers by corrupt elements of national armies, authorities and experts say.\n \n \n   The Myth of 90 Percent: Only a Small Fraction of Guns in Mexico Come From U.S. \n So, if not from the U.S., where do they come from? There are a variety of sources:\n \n -- The Black Market. Mexico is a virtual arms bazaar, with fragmentation grenades from South Korea, AK-47s from China, and shoulder-fired rocket launchers from Spain, Israel and former Soviet bloc manufacturers.\n \n -- Russian crime organizations. Interpol says Russian Mafia groups such as Poldolskaya and Moscow-based Solntsevskaya are actively trafficking drugs and arms in Mexico.\n \n - South America. During the late 1990s, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) established a clandestine arms smuggling and drug trafficking partnership with the Tijuana cartel, according to the Federal Research Division report from the Library of Congress.\n \n -- Asia. According to a 2006 Amnesty International Report, China has provided arms to countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Chinese assault weapons and Korean explosives have been recovered in Mexico.\n \n -- The Mexican Army. More than 150,000 soldiers deserted in the last six years, according to Mexican Congressman Robert Badillo. Many took their weapons with them, including the standard issue M-16 assault rifle made in Belgium.\n \n -- Guatemala. U.S. intelligence agencies say traffickers move immigrants, stolen cars, guns and drugs, including most of America's cocaine, along the porous Mexican-Guatemalan border. On March 27, La Hora, a Guatemalan newspaper, reported that police seized 500 grenades and a load of AK-47s on the border. Police say the cache was transported by a Mexican drug cartel operating out of Ixcan, a border town.\n\n \n And NOW we find out that Mexico's overall per capita crime rate is less than countries like the UK, Canada and ours? Maybe the problem is drugs and NOT the 2nd Amendment!",

Mexico City had the same drug/crime problem and that is where the Mexican Federales first went and still remain. The problem is that the average citizen is prohibited from ownership of guns while corrupt police and federales are at war with each other and they have plenty of guns.\n \n The border region may be written about more but has nothing to do with availabilty of guns from the U.S. any more than Mexico City. The worst shooting I ever witnessed was at the mid 60's Olympics in Mexico City when protestors of the election were gunned down around the walls and streets of the stadium.\n \n The border region is written about more because of the proximity to the U.S. and knee jerk reactions by Mexico to get more money and commitments from the U.S. \n \n We have covered this before as well as the 'guns from the U.S.' fallacy. Those guns are full auto, rocket launchers, grenades and anything else you can think of. They are not simply a border problem and if they came from the U.S. it was courtesy of the taxpayer and congress sending the Mex gov't the where with all to arm those who quit the army and police and kept their arms.\n \n The point that was being pressed by the media and our own government hysteria, aimed at an 'assault weapon ban' and wild claims about the SLAUGHTER on the border played on emotions until it was exposed for the farce it was and is. The lie about the increased deaths are debunked in the article Tither posted.",

   "Their View: Mexican gun control: The bitter irony - Las Cruces Sun-News\n \n Tough gun laws in Mexico? Ironic.\n \n [QUOTE]There is more than one irony here, in spite of extremely rigid and restrictive gun control laws, often the wrong people in Mexico still have the guns. Now, unregistered gun ownership has hugely increased among the Mexican cartels and gangs. The average citizen is unarmed and often helpless in regard to self defense. \n \n Our U.S. Constitution was framed by individuals who believed that armed citizens could protect themselves from tyranny. This was based upon the early Revolutionary War experience fought by American patriots. Thus given the differences in culture and history between the countries of Mexico and the United States, the divergence of gun ownership laws have clearly resulted in failure for our neighbors in the south. \n \n Is this a commentary against gun control and registration in the U.S.? You can arrive at your own conclusions. Should we look at the failure of the Mexican gun ownership policy model and go back and read the Second Amendment, which allows Americans to bear arms for self defense? Again, you may draw your own conclusions. \n \n Howard O. Ness lives in Las Cruces and is a retired federal employee who conducted several foreign missions during his career.",

By who won emoticon_xgood\n \n Did you miss this part or just hop on the headline?\n \nThe connection between the drug cartels and the Mexican army has given cartel leaders access to military grade weapons like the high powered Five-Seven semi-automatic pistols.\n \n A favorite with the cartels, the Five-Seven has the advantage of being light: under 2 pounds, with a 20-round clip filled with bullets the cartels call \"matapolicias' - \"cop killers.\"\n \n \"The 5.7 x 28, armor piercing (AP) rounds are not available for sale to the general public and are probably coming from the Mexican military,\" said Stewart who has analyzed U.S.-Mexican border security issues for half a decade.\n \n The drug-related murder rate in Mexico doubled in 2008 from just one year before, and as the violence escalates, the power of the drug cartels has destabilized Mexican authority to the point of threatening national security.\n \n Last week Gen. \u00c1ngeles Dahuajare announced that more than 17,000 soldiers had deserted in 2008.\n \n \"The Mexican Army is becoming a revolving door for the enforcement arm of the drug cartels; they simply pay better,\" Stewart said.\n \n \"If they don't get the weapons from the U.S., they'll get it from somewhere else: Brazil, Guatemala, Argentina or even former satellite state 'gray markets,'\" he said.\n \n Despite the efforts of his comrades in crime, El Hummer wound up in jail - and Mexican authorities paraded him before the media to reassure the public that they are still in control.\n \n But that was largely for show. As long as weapons flow into Mexico, the drug cartels will be able to develop an arsenal. \"Control\" will be unstable, at best.\n \n\n \n Now you should know that an arsenal like that is military goods and not something you can buy over here. The U.S. sold/loaned/gave Mexico a heck of a lot of weapons. Just because they were made in America (the Barrett) does not mean it was illegally sold from the U.S. population, maybe the military like the law rocket, RPGs and frag grenades.\n \n You have yet to see what happened to that truck load of cyanide in drums that was stolen and driven across the border about ten years ago. We will just be consistent and call that a \"straw purchase\" too.\n \n There has been three Texas valley sheriffs convicted of aiding the drug cartels as best I remember. Corruption runs deap when big money is involved. You don't get much milage blaming every day citizens for things like this. ...your common sense ought to be able to figure that out. emoticon_xclown",

   "What is the problem, and how do we solve it? Is it our 2nd Amendment?\n \n General Barry McCaffrey says.\n   Narco violence in Mexico -- A growing threat to US security \n 3. THE SITUATION IN MEXICO: \n A. The Mexican State is engaged in an increasingly violent, internal struggle against heavily armed narco-criminal cartels that have intimidated the public, corrupted much of law enforcement, and created an environment of impunity to the law. \n \n Squad-sized units of the police and Army have been tortured, murdered, and their decapitated bodies publicly left on display. The malignancy of drug criminality now contaminates not only the 2000 miles of cross-border U.S. communities but stretches throughout the United States in more than 295 U.S. cities. \n \n The outgunned Mexican law enforcement authorities face armed criminal attacks from platoon-sized units employing night vision goggles, electronic intercept collection, encrypted communications, fairly sophisticated information operations, sea-going submersibles, helicopters and modern transport aviation, automatic weapons, RPG's, anti-tank 66 mm rockets, mines and booby traps, heavy machine guns, 50 cal sniper rifles, massive use of military hand grenades, and the most modern models of 40mm grenade machine guns. \n\n Where can I purchase most of this? The answer. I can't. If anyone thinks that the 2nd amendment is the problem, is deluding themselves, or being politically motivated to think in that manner.\n \n Drugs and the Drug Gang culture is a better solution then to blame me! No?\n \n If this is a problem with REAL national security implications, I am sure our Special Forces would love to go down to the boarder and play cowboys and Drug Dealers with these vicious thugs! emoticon_smile \n \n Everything else is just Hot Air and everyone knows it!",

   "In Mexico, narcotraffickers and other criminals probably also get a substantial amount of US arms from Mexican police and military depots, either through theft or purchases from corrupt state servants. In 1991, the Pentagon gave Mexico nearly 50,000 M-1 rifle carbines,29 and during 1989-93, the State Department approved 108 licenses for the export of more than $34 million of small arms to Mexico. The Department performed only three follow-up inspections to ensure non-diversion of these arms.30 During 1991-93,the Commerce Department approved an additional 34 licenses for the export of over $3 million of shotguns andshells.31 End use checks are even rarer on Commerce-licensed arms.\n \n That is not counting helicopters with rocket launchers and machine guns and planes but also training at U.S. military bases like Ft. Bragg and others. This past year I believe the amount of arms given to Mexico was worth ten million dollars. This is an ongoing program that begin back in the '90's. Twenty years of the Pentagon and U.S. giving small arms and heavy arms and military helicopters and planes to the Mexican gov't. Is anyone surprised that some of these 'American made guns' turn up in Mexico of all places? That was sarcasm but it isn't funny!\n \n Gee, I got an idea, why don't we just build a fence? :xcensored emoticon_mad\n \n \nIn August 1994, just months before his brother fell to an assassin's bullet, Deputy Attorney General Mario Ruiz Massieu (now in jail in the US, awaiting trial on drug-related charges), said, \"We track the dealer and determine from where the shipment originates. [The guns] generally originate from US citizens and end up most of the time in the hands of gangsters, thieves, and other criminals, rather than organizations such as the Zapatista National Liberation Army.\" Situated in the southern part of the country, Mexico's leftist rebel armies appear to be getting their arms principally from enormous stores left over from the Central American wars of the 1980s. Many of those arms were, of course, supplied by Washington, too, either through massive military aid programs or as part of covert government operations. According to a report by the attorney general's office last fall, arms from north of the border are mainly being used in street crimes, such as holdups, kidnappings, and murders.15\n\n \n CON'T \n Although Mexico has produced military-style assault rifles under license from European gun manufacturers, it does not make or sell weapons approved for the general population.\n \n Many of the arms used by Mexico's insurgencies were supplied by Washington either through massive military aid programs or as part of US covert operations that left enormous arsenals behind.",

The drug cartels bought off cops, prison guards, a whole host of government officials, and even the army. Some of ours too!\n \n Not even to mention the havoc that all of these drugs creates in our Inner Cities!\n \n However, if you can stop the drugs from coming to America, then maybe you can stop the guns! Maybe. But then you would have to get all of the other countries to stop the drugs too. But the truth is, you can't stop the drugs, can you? Admit it! This problem won't go away till you do! THAT IS A FACT! \n \n It is also a FACT in England and Australia who has all of the gun control you say you want and a whole bunch more! What are the results?\n \n   Weapons sell for just \u00a350 as suspects and victims grow ever younger \n Senior police officers have been warning for several months that a growing number of teenagers in big cities are becoming involved in gun crime. \n The age of victims and suspects has fallen over the past three years as the availability of firearms in some cities has risen. \n &#8220;Illegal firearms have become increasingly accessible to younger offenders who appear more likely to use these firearms recklessly,&#8221; a report on gun crime commissioned by the Home Office cautioned last year.\n\n England & Aust gun studies \n   Shotguns for \u00a350: study reveals weapons culture  \n Sawn-off shotguns are still the weapon of choice for the more serious armed criminal and can now be bought illegally for between \u00a350 and \u00a3200, according to Home Office research. A purpose-built 9mm handgun, which is easier to conceal than a shotgun, is available for \u00a31,000-\u00a31,400 on the back streets of Britain while those wanting \"a gangster image\" can buy a  machine gun  for \u00a3800.\n Even though those interviewed were in prison, many still viewed gun crime as a \"viable career option\" enabling them to overcome their deprived backgrounds to secure wealth and status. One man from Greater Manchester claimed he had earned \u00a352,000 in a week from gun crime. The study shows that though Nottingham is dubbed Britain's gun crime capital, guns are far more available in Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham and London.\n\n Here is another report produced by Australian Institute of Criminology here called   Weapons, drugs and crime Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC) \n \n And a article about is in the report here.\n Link  Australian Institute of Criminology study -- Tough new weapons laws 'miss hard core of criminal underworld' \nCANBERRA - The introduction of tough laws to control guns and knives appears to be failing to keep lethal weapons out of the hands of Australian criminals. &#8230;. reported that while new laws may have helped reduce the number of knives and guns in illicit circulation,  they have failed to deter hard-core criminals. It also pointed to a large firearms black market. \n\n \n Do you really think you can concoct a gun control scheme that will stop guns flowing from all of those other countries, by controlling us? The 2 most exhaustive studies ever done on gun control says otherwise.  What did the CDC find?  \n &#8220;the task Force found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of any of the firearms laws or combinations of laws reviewed on violent outcomes.&#8221; \n\n Data on Firearms and Violence Too Weak to Settle Policy Debates; Comprehensive Research Effort Needed\n \n Here is an article about the study Link  who issued a 328-page report based on 253 journal articles, 99 books, 43 government publications, a survey of 80 different gun-control laws and some of its own independent study. \nIn short, the panel could find no link between restrictions on gun ownership and lower rates of crime, firearms violence or even accidents with guns. \n\n \n But again none of this has ever made a dent on what you want! Not even a scratch! You will go to your grave trying for more and more and even more gun control. Sinjin. I think you have a problem! You need an intervention! \n \n But it is not just you. \n \n Anti-gunners have a problem, and it is time to admit it!

When you make a statement followed by 'we' whom are you speaking for? You are beginning to sound like that kid at the counter explaining the signing for ammo in the early 70's when asked what he thought that would accomplish he replied, \"so if a crime is committed, we will know who did it\".\n \n Your thinking is similar and just as flawed and just as Marxist/Socialist. Governments in this past century alone have killed more people than all the wars together so why in the world do you insist on 'them' having complete control over the first and last line of defense of a free people? The gov't has gone too far already and are getting reigned in. Just yesterday the Washington Supreme Court ruled the 2A was already incorporated against State and local governments too.\n Have you put that sign up in front of your house stating you have a gun but will not use it in self defense? I thought not... Your words ring hollow just as a proclamation from a self imposed dictator. No condemnation of government, our own, from arming these same folks who are committing the killings in Mexico as is the Mexican police and military who are battling each other but you want to punish an American citizen who is/was a victim of theft or \"failure to report a stolen gun\" when, meanwhile, the government is excused.\n \n Who are you trying to gain approval of and why? This didactic, sonorous repetitive insistance on encouraging and appoving of infringement of rights by the very people it is designed to be a defense against ie. the government borders on lunacy. Go ahead and commit yourself to being a slave with no rights but quit trying to claim the government has rights, they do not, only powers enumerated in the Constitution on loan from the people. WE are the true rulers, not some abject excuse for humanity that happens to get elected to represent themselves. You have offered no legal basis for your insistance on actions that would violate \"our\" rights. \"We\" have offered history, law and long established tradition dating back to 1776.\n \n On the other hand, you have offered excuses and \"just a thought\". If you can't live by the Supreme Law of the Land then you can not obey other laws which makes you a criminal as well as a con man trying to get people who follow the law put in jail, prosecuted and denied their rights because of criminal acts of others. You have no sense of justice nor of right or wrong.\n \n Keep stamping those little feet and demanding \"I want, (we) demand this or that but hold \"us\" blameless for not abiding by the Constitution or creating infringement on long existing rights\". A liberal who believes that Marxist/Socialist ways which are foreign to our Constitution just haven't been tried by the right people yet. Every time you say \"we\" then everyone will know exactly who you are speaking for :xcensored",

You have offered no legal basis for your insistence on actions that would violate \"our\" rights. \"We\" have offered history, law and long established tradition dating back to 1776.\n \n   The Declaration of Independence. \nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. - That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, - That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes;\n\n \nOn the other hand, you have offered excuses and \"just a thought\". If you can't live by the Supreme Law of the Land then you can not obey other laws which makes you a criminal as well as a con man trying to get people who follow the law put in jail, prosecuted and denied their rights because of criminal acts of others. You have no sense of justice nor of right or wrong.\n\n Governments need to obey the law just like the owners of this country are supposed to do. The hired men and women, in this case our elected officials, are not better then the actual owners of this country. We the People. Everyone would do well to remember who they work for.\n   Preamble to the Bill of Rights clearly states the purpose of the Bill of Rights\nTHE Conventions of a number of the States having at the time of their adopting the Constitution, expressed a desire, in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers, that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added: And as extending the ground of public confidence in the Government, will best insure the beneficent ends of its institution\n\n It says \"further declaratory and restrictive clauses\". Restrictive against whom? The Government. \n \n You guys are not supposed to have all of the gun control you want. Only the absolute minimum necessary! Your argument fails because your side can't even prove that it works, let alone that it is necessary! \n \n Your thesis for asking for EVEN more infringements on OUR Bill of Rights is for Mexico, and not for the U.S.. You suggest that if we did what you ask, it will stop the Drug Cartels on Mexico. Everyone knows, to include you, that this is not true. \n \n But I am also sure that this will not stop you or change you mind, because this is what, the 3rd or 4th iteration of the same argument posed previously? \n \n But there again, I want to assure you that we will also defend your first amendment right to make it. And I mean with our very lives, if necessary! emoticon_smile",

Many lawnmowers are more expensive, think they ever look for them? Nope, they make an insurance claim just like gun owners do. When these same states have buybacks(a misnomer for sure) no questions ask, how many crime guns and stolen guns get covered up? All that sticks in your craw is that you want gun owners to bear added costs and become criminals which is one reason why kalifornia is in the financial shape it is...in the sewer.\n Your plan has been tried, show me the results. Notice Canada is doing away with it's two billion dollar gun 'registery'. No benefit. Show me what mandatory loss/theft reporting of guns will do besides make innocent men, victims of crime themselves, anything but a felon or misdomeanant. You are trying to punish the wrong people here and I am tired of your idiotic insistance that citizens who choose to protect themselves somehow gotta be guilty of something and try to label and put a tinge on a Constitutional Right!\n \n I am sure all of the losses are made to the insurance companies just like any other victim of crime does.

People who can read and write most often know the difference in right and wrong...then we got the Constitution as a guide. States only have the power given to them by their bosses.\n \n I am going to tell you a true story. I knew a fellow that had a house with bullet proof glass, a concrete safe room, and solid metal doors. He sold it at a healthy profit and built a nice new two story house. So happened he was a 'sunday sheriff' also. In his new house he had an alarm company install a fancy alarm with motion detectors and the whole works on the new house including his gun safes. He was retired and he and wife liked to travel, go for a week or two at a time. His first trip away after checking to make sure it was monitored by the alarm company and the Sheriff's office, he left with peace of mind. When he returned, his valuables had been stolen and about 25 of his guns out of his locked safes. Now he had no idea of when this had happened or how. The alarm company and the men who installed it were the culprits but it had been 14 days after the incident when it was established.\n \n Now take your lost/stolen deadline of 3 days. The good officers tell you when it happened and you are 13 days late reporting it. Wait you say, I didn't know until I got back. That is kinda tough Mr. sinjin suh, we got the perps now and they are co-operating and told us when they stole them and got the combination to your safes. You know you were supposed to report them within 3 days! Sorry but you go before the judge now to determine the fine and jail time and punishment for failure to report and whatever else we can think up. Put your hands behind your back now or we will also charge you with obstruction of justice and resisting arrest. \"But, but\" you explain, I had this alarm. Sorry suh, the law is the law so we gotta take you in. BTW, did your wife know the law or have interest in these dangerous firearms, well we gotta take her in to since you are married and half is hers, \"right\"?\n But what about the perps? \"oh, theys cooperating Mistah sinjin suh\" they is out on bail to testify against you. Sorry suh, the law is the law and even though they are the ones that put the alarm in and knew how to defeat it that is just tough luck.\n \n He found his guns in a neighbor's field when he was ploughing cotton all rusted and warped and dinged. \n \n See, these things have a way of snowballing and you never think about what actually happens when valuables were stolen. This is an actual story but it didn't work out like above because we don't have mandatory reporting. It would be easy to become the perp when you are a responsible reliable citizen. If a judge or dept. had tried that in most locals of Texas there would be instant recall petitions and county courts would be packed demanding some heads.\n \n That is why you can't find any unsuccesful challenges!

   "Canada had all you wanted and even more...now they are ending the bottomless pit and your girlfriend, Cathy Cukier is bemoaning the fact that over 700,000 registration numbers will be lost. Never solved nor help solve a crime. Zilch, nada, zero. Just like NY registration scheme.\n\n Yeah Doc, Just like sinjin ignored   this part of the post about English and Australian experiment  with gun control as crime control. emoticon_smile \n \n Here is a few stories over Australia's never ending gun amnesty. I don't know sinjin but either the Australians really do not want to register them, or they bought them illegally because they felt the Government has no business knowing what they have. \n \n   Gun amnesty under way \n The amnesty is the third conducted in NSW in the past 10 years, with 63,000 handguns being handed into police during the 2001 and 2003 operations.\n \n \"We have taken 63,000 illegal firearms off the streets so far but there are still more to go and we are always doing what we can to protect the community.\"\n\n Then just recently they had a new or continued Amnesty. Here are a progression of articles from the last one. \n   South Australians surrender more than 1100 guns during amnesty \n \"What we wanted to do was to flush out those illegal weapons that are out in the community,\" he said. \"That means there is now no longer any excuses and those retaining illegal weapons better watch out because we now have by far the toughest illegal fire arms laws in the country. \"If people have a fire arms prohibition notice slapped on them, they can be searched anywhere and face up to a 15 year maximum jail sentence.\"\n\n Meaning, not criminal's guns, but the guns you own but did not tell the government about! \n   Police collect deadly guns haul \n Firearms Branch officer-in-charge Chief-Inspector Jim Langmead said eight military assault Class-D rifles had been handed to police. \"I'm surprised we're still getting Class-D firearms but (police) jurisdictions in other states are reporting they're still finding them too,\" he said. \"They were very popular in the 1980s but they're heavily restricted now.\"\n\n \n \n   Machine guns uncovered by police -- Year-long operation targeting illegal supply --Two men arrested\n AN AK-47 assault rifle, a high-calibre sniper rifle and machine guns are among a large cache of weapons uncovered by police in a sting operation culminating in a series of Sydney raids.\n Undercover officers bought a range of illegal guns, including the AK-47, over a series of months from a targeted supplier.\n In a similar raid yesterday, in Powder Works Road, Elanora Heights, officers seized a large cache of weapons. \n It included a 22 Magnum revolver, a 12-gauge shotgun, a .410 calibre shotgun and ammunition, two .22 calibre rifles, two Lee Enfield .303 bolt-action rifles, a M6 Scout dual calibre shotgun/rifle, a .270 calibre bolt-action rifle, a .45 calibre muzzle loading rifle, a 22-250 calibre bolt-action rifle andXa Martini Action rifle. \n\n I know, maybe the American criminals will just import guns in with their Mexican illegal drugs. I don't know for sure but I believe the Mexican Drug gangs wouldn't mind another revenue stream. Net results, Zilch, nada, zero. But you know that! emoticon_smile Gun control is nothing but a scam!",

That is in print on this board :)\n \n Read this AM that kalifornians are going to have to pay $300 or $500 dollars for a 9-1-1 call now or subscribe to the list for $48 a year. I suppose this is just the logical outcome of an overbearing government imposing on EMT and PO valuable time. Maybe they will wake up to who is really responsible for their safety but I doubt it...I mean, it isn't like they are paying taxes to support that already because now it has been devalued to a priviledge and you have to \"purchase\" police protection or medical service like transfer by ambulance.\n \n I can see the officers at the scene of a crash going through the billfolds to look for the 9-1-1 cards and doing a triage based on who gets taken to the hospital by ambulance. I expect, \"he didn't make it because he wasn't a subscriber nor did he have $500 in his pocket\", kinda tough :)\n \n That is the same thing they want to do to all rights, especially the 2A, punish and fine gun owners exercising their unalienable rights. kalifornia is in the outhouse financially because of waste and largess to political cronies and they need the worker bees to cut back on their intake and work a little harder. Perhaps it is fitting but is still a travesty. Seems most folks are slow learners since they advocate a \"democracy\" which this Nation never was and hopefully never will be on my watch. I suspect if the FF were here most of these tyrants would already have lost their head or worse from what they already have done to this once fine Republic. The right to keep and bear arms goes to the very soul of individual rights and protects the others which tyrants understand very well. The very mention of limiting rights or trying to control individual loss should be marked by a trail of tar and feathers to the nearest port of expulsion.

Not theirs, and it is not yours.\n\n \n Good points!\n \n The power of government and it's laws must be in their just capacity, any body of government as is stated in Marbury v Madison:\n \n \nMarshall memorably defined the Supreme Court's duty under the U.S. Constitution: \n \n It is, emphatically, the province and duty of the judicial department, to say what the law is\u00e2\u0080|. So, if a law be in opposition to the constitution; if both the law and the constitution apply to a particular case, so that the court must either decide that case, conformable to the law, disregarding the constitution; or conformable to the constitution, disregarding the law; the court must determine which of these conflicting rules governs the case; this is of the very essence of judicial duty. If then, the courts are to regard the constitution, and the constitution is superior to any ordinary act of the legislature, the constitution, and not such ordinary act, must govern the case to which both apply.\n Significance\n \n The Marbury decision provided the constitutional basis for the Supreme Court's power of judicial review of the actions and laws of the federal government. This decision asserted the Court's power to declare invalid those federal laws it finds in conflict with the Constitution. The Court's decision laid the foundation on which the Supreme Court eventually developed into an important branch of the federal government.\n \n Full acceptance of judicial review would not happen until after the Civil War. Regardless, this case established the principle that the courts and government should not enforce unconstitutional federal laws.\n",

   "  FEDERALIST No. 78 \n Nor does this conclusion by any means suppose a superiority of the judicial to the legislative power. It only supposes that the power of the people is superior to both; and that where the will of the legislature, declared in its statutes, stands in opposition to that of the people, declared in the Constitution, the judges ought to be governed by the latter rather than the former. They ought to regulate their decisions by the fundamental laws, rather than by those which are not fundamental. \n \n This independence of the judges is equally requisite to guard the Constitution and the rights of individuals from the effects of those ill humors, which the arts of designing men, or the influence of particular conjunctures, sometimes disseminate among the people themselves, and which, though they speedily give place to better information, and more deliberate reflection, have a tendency, in the meantime, to occasion dangerous innovations in the government, and serious oppressions of the minor party in the community. Though I trust the friends of the proposed Constitution will never concur with its enemies,3 in questioning that fundamental principle of republican government, which admits the right of the people to alter or abolish the established Constitution, whenever they find it inconsistent with their happiness, yet it is not to be inferred from this principle, that the representatives of the people, whenever a momentary inclination happens to lay hold of a majority of their constituents, incompatible with the provisions in the existing Constitution, would, on that account, be justifiable in a violation of those provisions; or that the courts would be under a greater obligation to connive at infractions in this shape, than when they had proceeded wholly from the cabals of the representative body. Until the people have, by some solemn and authoritative act, annulled or changed the established form, it is binding upon themselves collectively, as well as individually; and no presumption, or even knowledge, of their sentiments, can warrant their representatives in a departure from it, prior to such an act. But it is easy to see, that it would require an uncommon portion of fortitude in the judges to do their duty as faithful guardians of the Constitution, where legislative invasions of it had been instigated by the major voice of the community. \n\n Our Original Contract with America!

As I believe Lopez and Morrison are more consistent with the text of the Commerce Clause and the principles of enumerated powers, I would prefer that the Supreme Court uphold these decisions and overturn or severely limit Gonzales v.

   "David Kopel writes: (AND he agrees with me or vice versa)\n \n \nThat's that title of a forthcoming article in a Santa Clara Law Review symposium, by Clayton Cramer and me. We examine, in detail, scores of important cases, from Bliss v. Commonwealth in 1822 up to the present. We explain which cases can provide useful guidance to modern courts which must interpret the Second Amendment (and which cases use an approach is plainly inapplicable to Second Amendment analysis, post-Heller).\n \n Our Article also addresses Adam Winkler's influential and well-written 2007 Michigan Law Review article, which surveyed post-WW II state cases. Our article studies a broader range of cases, and gets into more depth on those cases, so it's 93 pages long. It was even longer until the editors changed the typeface from Century Schoolbook to Times New Roman. Here's the abstract:\n \n Cases on the right to arms in state constitutions can provide useful guidance for courts addressing Second Amendment issues. Although some people have claimed that state courts always use a highly deferential version of \"reasonableness,\" this article shows that many courts have employed rigorous standards, including the tools of strict scrutiny, such as overbreadth, narrow tailoring, and less restrictive means. Courts have also used categoricalism (deciding whether something is inside or outside the right) and narrow construction (to prevent criminal laws from conflicting with the right to arms). Even when formally applying \"reasonableness,\" many courts have used reasonableness as a serious, non-deferential standard of review. District of Columbia v. Heller teaches that supine standards of review, such as deferring to the mere invocation of \"police power,\" are inappropriate in Second Amendment interpretation. This article surveys important state cases from the Early Republic to the present, and explains how they may be applied to the Second Amendment.\n \n The article is founded on the tremendous research on state cases which Clayton conducted for his 1994 book For the Defense of Themselves and the State. That book was cited by the Washington Supreme Court in its new decision State v. Sieyes.\n",

If they had that power under interstate commerce, why did they let the longshoreman and then president Goober Carter halt the export grain sales in the late 1970s??? All that did was create other countries grain sales and our farmers became wholesale suppliers to other nations who in turn took advantage of the situation and were selling the grain to those same nations we were prevented from selling to at twice the price and profiting without touching a grain.

   "  Narcotics traffickers are acquiring firepower more appropriate to an army -- including grenade launchers and antitank rockets -- and the police are feeling outgunned \n \n The Feb. 21 attack on police headquarters in coastal Zihuatanejo, which injured four people, fit a disturbing trend of Mexico's drug wars. Traffickers have escalated their arms race, acquiring military-grade weapons, including hand grenades, grenade launchers, armor-piercing munitions and antitank rockets with firepower far beyond the assault rifles and pistols that have dominated their arsenals.\n \n Most of these weapons are being smuggled from Central American countries or by sea, eluding U.S. and Mexican monitors who are focused on the smuggling of semiauto- matic and conventional weapons purchased from dealers in the U.S. border states of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California.\n\n   Kerry in solidarity with Mexico in drug fight \n Ninety percent of the weapons seized from the cartels and traced by ATF originated in the United States. \n \n What is less common, however, is the cooperation that occurred in this case. Only about one out of every four weapons seized by Mexican authorities last year was submitted to the ATF so they could be traced back to purchasers and sellers in the United States..\n \n   Mexican drug cartels do not need U.S. gun shops in order to arm themselves \n So in regard the other 75% of the weapons, the Mexican government--for whatever reason--is keeping the BATFE in the dark.

I was prowling around on some of those links and a police chief in Sullivan City as arrested for narcotic trafficing; had a large amount of cocaine and a large sum of money.\n \n Another link said over 2,000 federal prosecutors were being dispatched to the border area just to prosecute official corruption.

What we got is a bunch of Mexican troops lined up for an apparent invasion and they don't want any resistance. A lot of XXXXXX can't see what is taking place and latch onto a tired worn cliche that has always been a lie and trying to use it as a means to disarm American citizens. They have our officials over here in their pocket and the only resistance left is the armed citizen; I don't think any of them are going to give up their rights nor their lands and homes because Calderon and congress nor the president would like them to. Ain't going to happen.\n \n There is no doubt in my mind this was a set up deal, it just didn't come off the way they wanted it to.

Two of three female roommates were upstairs when they heard men break in and attack the third. After repeated calls to the police over half an hour, the roommate's screams stopped, and they assumed the police had arrived. They went downstairs and were held captive, raped, robbed, beaten, and forced to commit sexual acts upon one another and to submit to the attackers' sexual demands for 14 hours. The police had lost track of the repeated calls for assistance. DC's highest court ruled that the police do not have a legal responsibility to provide personal protection to individuals, and absolved the police and the city of any liability.[2]\n \n Contents [hide]\n 1 Incident \n 2 Appellants' claims \n 3 Decision \n 4 References \n 5 See also\n\n \n Links above at site.",

   "Taking On Gun Control - Do You Have a Right to Police Protection?\n \n \nOne of the basic themes of gun control is that only the police and military should have handguns or any type of firearm. I cannot explain their rationale, other than to say that gun control proponents must believe that the police exist to protect the citizenry from victimization. But in light of court decisions we find such is not the case. You have no right to expect the police to protect you from crime. Incredible as it may seem, the courts have ruled that the police are not obligated to even respond to your calls for help, even in life threatening situations!. To be fair to our men in blue, I think most officers really do want to save lives and stop dangerous situations before people get hurt. But the key point to remember is that they are under no legal obligation to do so. \n \n \n \n Case Histories\n Ruth Brunell called the police on 20 different occasions to plead for protection from her husband. He was arrested only one time. One evening Mr. Brunell telephoned his wife and told her he was coming over to kill her. When she called the police, they refused her request that they come to protect her. They told her to call back when he got there. Mr. Brunell stabbed his wife to death before she could call the police to tell them that he was there. The court held that the San Jose police were not liable for ignoring Mrs. Brunell's pleas for help. Hartzler v. City of San Jose, 46 Cal. App. 3d 6 (1st Dist. 1975).\n [Those of you in the Silicon Valley, please note what city this happened in!] \n \n Consider the case of Linda Riss, in which a young woman telephoned the police and begged for help because her ex-boyfriend had repeatedly threatened \"If I can't have you no one else will have you, and when I get through with you, no-one else will want you.\" The day after she had pleaded for police protection, the ex-boyfriend threw lye in her face, blinding her in one eye, severely damaging the other, and permanently scarring her features. \"What makes the City's position particularly difficult to understand,\" wrote a dissenting opinion in her tort suit against the City, \"is that, in conformity to the dictates of the law, Linda did not carry any weapon for self-defense. Thus, by a rather bitter irony she was required to rely for protection on the City of New York which now denies all responsibility to her.\" Riss v. New York, 240 N.E.2d 860 (N.Y. 1968). [Note: Linda Riss obeyed the law, yet the law prevented her from arming herself in self-defense.] \n \n Warren v. District of Columbia is one of the leading cases of this type. Two women were upstairs in a townhouse when they heard their roommate, a third woman, being attacked downstairs by intruders. They phoned the police several times and were assured that officers were on the way. After about 30 minutes, when their roommate's screams had stopped, they assumed the police had finally arrived. When the two women went downstairs they saw that in fact the police never came, but the intruders were still there. As the Warren court graphically states in the opinion: ``For the next fourteen hours the women were held captive, raped, robbed, beaten, forced to commit sexual acts upon each other, and made to submit to the sexual demands of their attackers.'' The three women sued the District of Columbia for failing to protect them, but D.C.'s highest court exonerated the District and its police, saying that it is a ``fundamental principle of American law that a government and its agents are under no general duty to provide public services, such as police protection, to any individual citizen.'' Warren v. District of Columbia, 444 A.2d 1 (D.C. Ct. of Ap., 1981). \n \n The seminal case establishing the general rule that police have no duty under federal law to protect citizens is DeShaney v. Winnebago County Department of Social Services (109 S.Ct. 998, 1989). Frequently these cases are based on an alleged ``special relationship'' between the injured party and the police. In DeShaney the injured party was a boy who was beaten and permanently injured by his father. He claimed a special relationship existed because local officials knew he was being abused, indeed they had ``specifically proclaimed by word and deed [their] intention to protect him against that danger,'' but failed to remove him from his father's custody. (\"Domestic Violence -- When Do Police Have a Constitutional Duty to Protect?'' Special Agent Daniel L. Schofield, S.J.D., FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin, January, 1991.) \n \n The Court in DeShaney held that no duty arose because of a \"special relationship,'' concluding that Constitutional duties of care and protection only exist as to certain individuals, such as incarcerated prisoners, involuntarily committed mental patients and others restrained against their will and therefore unable to protect themselves. ``The affirmative duty to protect arises not from the State's knowledge of the individual's predicament or from its expressions of intent to help him, but from the limitation which it has imposed on his freedom to act on his own behalf.'' (DeShaney v. Winnebago County Department of Social Services, 109 S.Ct. 998 (1989) at 1006.) \n \n About a year later, the United States Court of Appeals interpreted DeShaney in the California case of Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Department. (901 F.2d 696 9th Cir. 1990) Ms. Balistreri, beaten and harassed by her estranged husband, alleged a \"special relationship'' existed between her and the Pacifica Police Department, to wit, they were duty-bound to protect her because there was a restraining order against her husband. The Court of Appeals, however, concluded that DeShaney limited the circumstances that would give rise to a \"special relationship'' to instances of custody. Because no such custody existed in Balistreri, the Pacifica Police had no duty to protect her, so when they failed to do so and she was injured they were not liable. \n \n A citizen injured because the police failed to protect her can only sue the State or local government in federal court if one of their officials violated a federal statutory or Constitutional right, and can only win such a suit if a \"special relationship'' can be shown to have existed, which DeShaney and its progeny make it very difficult to do. Moreover, Zinermon v. Burch (110 S.Ct. 975, 984 1990) very likely precludes Section 1983 liability for police agencies in these types of cases if there is a potential remedy via a State tort action. \n \n Many states, however, have specifically precluded such claims, barring lawsuits against State or local officials for failure to protect, by enacting statutes such as California's Government Code, Sections 821, 845, and 846 which state, in part: \"Neither a public entity or a public employee [may be sued] for failure to provide adequate police protection or service, failure to prevent the commission of crimes and failure to apprehend criminals.'' \n \n In other words this means the only people the police are duty-bound to protect are criminals in custody, and other persons in custody for such things as mental disorders. YOU have no recourse if the police fail to respond or fail to protect you from injury! \n \n",

   "Re: the two illegal immigrants accused of trying to smuggle firearms and ammo into Mexico:\n \n I don't smell a rat, Doc. I don't put much weight on the short sentence they have received up front for the charge of illegal entry into the US. That's quick and easy to prove, and it looks to me like a \"let's use this to hold them while we investigate the guns\" situation. It does not appear they have been charged yet for the firearms.\n \n Don't know if any of the weapons are \"fully automatic.\" The reporter thinks so, but does not say why he thinks so or even how many he believes are that way. I have seen full auto firearms in the possession of Mexican drug dealers before. They were semi-autos that had been illegally converted.\n \n My suspicion is ATF is trying to trace the weapons to see if there is a common link (something I would suspect) in how they were acquired-whether it be a corrupt gun dealer, a frequently appearing name as a straw purchaser, etc. Also, many times ammo can be traced by lot number so the feds may be able to find a common link in how the ammo was acquired. \n \n Examples of existing federal firearms laws they could have violated are:\n \n 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n \n (a) It shall be unlawful -\n \n (1) for any person -\n \n (A) except a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer, to engage in the business of importing, manufacturing, or dealing in firearms, or in the course of such business to ship, transport, or receive any firearm in interstate or foreign commerce\n \n AND\n \n 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n \n (g) It shall be unlawful for any person -\n \n (5) who, being an alien -\n \n (A) is illegally or unlawfully in the United States; \n to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\n \n AND (if any of the firearms are fully automatic)\n \n 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n \n (a) It shall be unlawful -\n \n (4) for any person, other than a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, licensed dealer, or licensed collector, to transport in interstate or foreign commerce any destructive device, machinegun (as defined in section 5845 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986), short-barreled shotgun, or short-barreled rifle, except as specifically authorized by the Attorney General consistent with public safety and necessity;\n \n I believe each offense carries a max of 5 years, and they could have additional sentencing enhancements if, for example, a link can be made to assisting drug trafficking. Those guys are in a lot of trouble, and it will be interesting to see how the investigation and prosecution turns out.\n \n But we don't know anything about these guys yet. In my experience with Mexican organized crime guys like this are just the hired mules. If that is the case, and if I were their lawyer, then I would consider encouraging them to try and bargain by rolling on whoever they might know who is higher up in the food chain. But right now we don't know who else is involved, if anyone, or whether these guys are talking or not. We will just have to wait and see.",
