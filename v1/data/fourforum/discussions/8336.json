   "People get called to serve God as priests, bishops, and archbishops. If the people God calls are female or gay, what business is it of ours to quibble? The episcopal church didn't apologise for ordaining bishop someone who was gay, they apologised for doing it without discussion with the wider communion. Other instances where gay priests have been candidates for bishoprics, and have not been chosen, indicate this has a lot more to do with people trying to fathom who God wants rather than pursuing a secular social agenda. Of course, conservatives can't admit that because that would indicate that God wasn't a misogynist homophobe, which would leave them feeling a little lonely.",
