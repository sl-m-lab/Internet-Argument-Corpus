Spanish intelligence has found evidence that two Algerians provided Atta a false passport.\n \n \n Do you think there could have been a link between Iraq and Atta? I do.\n\n \n That is not new information, it was first reported over 4 months ago in the wall street journal. Epstein is making a pretty huge leap in logic to suggest that the fact that he was meeting with a \"hamburg Student\" means he was meeting with Atta. A far more realistic scenario, since the FBI and CIA have both confirmed that Atta was in the United States at the time, is that the single person who made the identification was mistaken. I am a little unclear as why you posted the third link as evidence of this alleged link. HEre are a few chioce paragraphs from the 9/11 commission page which covers possible terrorist connections.\n \n \nIn my judgment, Saddam assessed Usama bin Ladin and al-Qaida as a threat rather than a potential partner to be exploited to attack the United States. Bin Ladin wanted to attack Iraq after it occupied Kuwait in 1990 rather than have the Saudi government depend on foreign military forces. Several captured al-Qaida operatives have said Usama refused to consider working for or with Saddam, according to press accounts. Saddam would have understood that after Usama had realized his ambition to remove U.S. forces from Arabia and eliminate the Al Sa`ud and other ruling families in the Gulf, that he would have been the next target. The threat would have appeared particularly risky to Saddam, given the modest indicators of a revival in personal piety and Islamist dress among Iraqi Sunnis in the last decade. He certainly suspected Saudi Arabia of encouraging Wahhabi pietism and practices among Iraq's Sunni Arabs and Bin Ladin's loyalists would have been suspect of similar anti-regime activities. \n \n \n \nSaddam and Bin Ladin worked together and Iraqi intelligence \"ran\" the al-Qaida networks. Evidence includes meetings between Iraqi intelligence agents and al-Qaida operatives in Sudan, the Czech Republic, and Afghanistan. In the 1980s and 1990s every international terrorist group and state sponsor was represented in Sudan. Iraq, Iran, and most Islamist organizations were welcomed by Hassan al-Turabi, the Islamist leader of the military-dominated regime. How could they not meet in Khartoum, a small city offering many opportunities for terrorist t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eates. Czech and American intelligence officials say they are unable to confirm any meeting between al-Qaida operative Mohammed Atta and an Iraqi intelligence officer, identified as Ahmed Khalil Ibrahim Samir al-Ani. I would be disappointed if an Iraqi intelligence officer did not meet with al-Qaida operatives. He would have been derelict in his duty if he did not at least try to arrange a meeting. His purpose would have been to assess intent, operational capability, and recruitment potential. It would not have been sufficient for both simply to hate the U.S. Saddam always demanded total loyalty from and control over any group he supported. The evidence is fairly clear, at least in my mind, that al-Qaida would not be subordinated to any government, even if Usama had admired Saddam, which he did not. Finally, it is claimed that a senior Iraqi intelligence operative, Farouk Hijazi, who served as head of the Iraqi intelligence service as well as ambassador to Turkey, Jordan, and Tunisia, met with Usama in Afghanistan\n\n \n \nThe Prague Connection. Much of the evidence of Iraqi links to al-Qaida is based on meetings alleged to have occurred in Khartoum, Prague and Kandahar between Iraqi intelligence agents and al-Qaida operatives. Czech President Vaclav Havel denied there was any evidence to confirm reports that Mohammed Atta, a leader of the 9/11 attacks, had met with an Iraqi intelligence officer, Ahmed Khalil Ibrahim Samir al-Ani, in Prague in April, 2001, five months before the attacks. American records indicate Atta was in Virginia Beach in early April 2001, and DCI George Tenet told Congress in testimony after 9/11 that the CIA could find no evidence to confirm that the Prague meeting took place. (James Risen, \"Prague Discounts an Iraqi Meeting,\" The New York Times, 21 October 2002). Al-Ani was subsequently ordered to leave the Czech Republic after he was caught taking photos of the Radio Free Europe Building in Prague. Iraq recalled its Ambassador to Turkey, Farouk Yahya al-Hijazi on 30 November 2001 following allegations he had been in contact with Mohammed Atta and other members of al-Qaida. According to press reports, Usama bin Ladin was \"believed to have met repeatedly with officers of Iraq's Special Security Organization . . . and seems to have ties to Iraq's Mukhabarat.\" Hijazi allegedly traveled to Afghanistan in December 1998 and, according to a 1999 report in the Guardian (UK) Saddam was \"thought to have offered bin Laden asylum in Iraq.\" (Richard Miniter, \"The Visible Hand: The Iraq Connection President Bush must win the war his father started,\" The Wall Street Journal Online, 24 September 2001.) An Israeli specialist on terrorism cites an Italian press article that Hijazi met bin Ladin in Sudan as early as 1994. European security officials claimed in March 2001, however, that Saddam personally decided against allowing Usama bin Ladin and al-Qaida to use Iraq as a base because he feared they might destabilize his regime. See David Ignatius, \"Dubious Iraqi Link,\" The Washington Post, 15 March 2001, p. A23. \n \n \n Here is one that you should probably take to heart\n \n \nAlways check reliability statements and do not blindly accept what is not vetted or what seems implausible\n\n \n Even the president has quite beating this dead horse. IF he can't prove a link (and he surely would if he could) it seems pretty unlikely that his supporters will be able to based on articles regarding vague notations in appointment books. \n \n It is time for you folks to wake up and realise that there were not WMD's, and that Saddam was NOT connected to Al-Queda. How long are you going to continue arguing this based on (in the case of terrorism) allegations already disproven by our own government and (in the case of WMDs) IRaqi magicians apparent ability to hide the transport or destruction of hundreds of tons of chemical or biological weapons from our satellites.\n \n I realise that denial is a powerful tool when confronted with unpleasant information, but it is time to wake up and see things for what they are.",

   "Enlighten me with a link that shows they were all destroyed.\n\n \n Here is a link from USA today:\n \n http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2004-03-02-un-wmd_x.htm\n \n Here is one from CBS:\n \n http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/01/18/iraq/main537096.shtml\n \n Here is a transcript of the report blix gave to the UN 01/27/03\n \n http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/middle_east/iraq/blix_report.html\n \n Here is the specific paragraph from that transcript that involves destuction of WMD's:\n \n \nThe implementation of Resolution 687 nevertheless brought about considerable disarmament results. It has been recognized that more weapons of mass destruction were destroyed under this resolution than were destroyed during the Gulf War. Large quantities of chemical weapons were destroyed under UNSCOM's supervision before 1994. While Iraq claims, with little evidence, that it destroyed all biological weapons unilaterally in 1991, it is certain that UNSCOM destroyed large biological weapons production facilities in 1996. The large nuclear infrastructure was destroyed, and the fissionable material was removed from Iraq by the IAEA. \n \n \n You will note that further in the report he outlines some ares that still need work and some questions that remain unanswered. He also states that at the time of the report, the Iraqis were working with the inspection teams to clarify these grey areas.\n \n Here is a later report (november) \n \n http://www.iraqcrisis.co.uk/resources.php?idtag=R3FF955E3BFE79\n \n This section goes a long ways towards explaining why it is so difficult to verify destruction of weapons:\n \n \nAnother activity has been the additional analysis of samples of biological weapons material (Bacillus anthracis) declared by Iraq to have been unilaterally destroyed at two locations: Al-Aziziyah firing range and Al-Hakam dumping site.\n \n In the Commission&#8217;s thirteenth quarterly report (see S/2003/580), it was noted that Bacillus anthracis DNA had been identified in liquid samples taken from two R-400 biological bombs excavated earlier in 2003 at Al-Aziziyah.\n \n Molecular genotyping of that material has now been carried out by a laboratory within the UNMOVIC network of reference laboratories. The analysis confirms that the genotype of the B. anthracis strain in the R-400 samples was identical to the genotype of the B. anthracis strain which Iraq declared it had selected for weaponization and placed in R-400 bombs\n\n \n \n You will note that the samples taken from the bombs at the Al-Aziziyah facility (one of the facilities where Iraq blew up or otherwise destroyed its stockpiles) were found shortly before the 13th quarterly report. This report was issued in June. Now, in this November report, they are saying that they have finally gotten test results confirming that the material was indeed bioweapons. This means that they have confirmed Iaqi claims that they had destroyed bioweapons at the facility.\n \n The problem you run into with requiring proof of destruction of every Iraqi chemical or biological weapon is that directly following gulf I, Iraq was ordered to destroy those weapons. LATER, we said \"oh, yea, and we want to stand there and watch it\". How do you conclusively prove that you burned a furnace full of anthrax to inert ashes? It is nearly impossible. IF we had STARTED with the condition that we stand and watch, this would be much easier.\n \n It wuld be helpful in determining the actual scope of the Iraqi WMD program if the BUsh Administration would declasify the Kay report. Immediatly after recieveing the report, they classified it to the point that even those who had prepared it did not have authority to access it. YOu do this so you can edit the report without fears of people jumping up and saying \"THATS NOT WHAT I SAID\".\n \n THe only reason for them to classify that report is that it proved beyond a doubt that they were WRONG, and the UN inspection team was RIGHT. THere were no WMD's.",
