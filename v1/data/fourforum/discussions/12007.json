   "OC stated earlier that most illegally obtained weapons are stolen from vehicles. Currently, we're going to focus on securing the weapons. So what would you do if you had your way?\n \n Although this may sound strange to many of you, I think the solution is to loosen laws, not tighten them. Long story short, issue CCWs without forcing people to go through a big legal hassle. A background check is a must, but it shouldn't be any tighter than what you go through to legally obtain a firearm. You won't need to leave a gun in a vehicle if you can carry it with you, and if it's harder to get a CCW than it is to purchase a gun, then you'll have no choice to leave it in your home; where you can't always be to keep it out of the wrong hands.",

   "Uh...so you expect people to walk around with rifles? And some handguns are not really concealable. Like a large revolver. \n \n There really isn't a non-fascist way of absolutely ensuring that people use proper safety measures when it comes to securing weapons in homes. We can't even get everyone to practice basic firearm safety! \n \n I suppose we could fine people for leaving firearms in their cars like parking tickets until they get the message that vehicles are not secure ways of protecting your firearms. \n \n I suppose we could also mandate that people are required to purchase gun safes once they acquire a certain number of weapons, but that doesn't ensure they will use them. But having the gun safe is generally better then not having it at all. My friend's got one that required four movers to move into his house empty. Without a fork lift, it would be rather difficult given how many weapons he's got in it now. \n \n The best real way of simply education. We may need to throw in horror stories of people having their firearms stolen and those firearms used in horrible crimes to get them to pay attention. Like a family having their handgun stolen and then it later used in a robbery gone bad that kills them. Some truly horrific.",

   "A safe is really just a deterrent. It's to keep the bad guys from simply taking your gun and getting out. Most burglaries are just grab and go so therefore even a thin sheet metal gun lock from Wally world would work. I got myself a safe and gun lock because there are children in my house. If there are no children in your house I don't why a person needs to buy safe. As long as they can hide them well enough and take responsibility if they get it stolen is fine with me. Also the trigger lock thing that happened to pass is a complete waste of money. We have to provide proof we bought a lock, go get gun show the dealer the lock receipts then he does the deal. Why do I need to buy a lock when I have freaking safe? Oh well, if you are smart, you'd just save the lock for the deal and then return the stupid thing back to Wally world. Also, very little criminals get their guns from gunshows. Most get them stolen or buy them illegally (which are usually stolen.) The most we can do is a. educate the owners to buy, at least a small safe for handguns and a decent lock box for rifles. It doesn't really cost much to get a lock box. Mine cost about 70 dollars. b. put more police to work on getting resellers. Also you if you think the police are safe from getting their guns stolen you are mistaken. A friend of my dad's told us once that in his department 5 mp5s were stolen from one of those armory trucks. Mp5's!!! You know those are automatic right?",
