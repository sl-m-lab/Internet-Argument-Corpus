National polls indicate that a substantial number of Americans did/do oppose the invasion so it's no surprise this movie (Fahrenheit 911) will have it's critics. As far as its accuracy, I haven't seen the movie but I know our own government wasn't that accurate when they sold us on the invasion. Lastly, Micheal Moore will make money on his movie, but he'll do it the old fashioned, American way: people will voluntarily hand it to him in exchange for watching his movie. This is much different from the \"no bid\" contracts our government awarded \"preferentially\" to companies working in Iraq: that's not the American way. Anyway, I didn't vote in the poll because neither of the options was appropriate.",

The Clinton administration was obviously aware of the Hussein and Bin Laden threat and for that matter so was Bush Sr. I'm not saying Clinton's foreign policy was flawless, I'm saying that taking the US to a long costly war that wasn't absolutely necessary was a bad call for this administration. In addition, unlike Bush Sr., who built a solid global coalition, Bush Jr. chose to ignore the rest of the world and that's why America is bearing the brunt of this war both financially and with our 140,000 troops. As I eluded to earlier, liking Micheal Moore's movie is directly related to whether or not you think the war was a good idea.

It is said by some to be a documentary but this is false.\n \n Documentary: Presenting facts objectively without editorializing or inserting fictional matter, as in a book or film. \n \n While there are selective facts presented the movie is by no means objective. If you had seen you would not attempt to argue.\n \n The movie fits this definition much better:\n \n Propaganda - Material disseminated by the advocates or opponents of a doctrine or cause: wartime propaganda. \n \n Why?\n \n Because the material presented is one sided. I'll provide you with some examples.\n 1. In the movie it shows soldiers stationed in Iraq who don't agree with the war and they say such as \"If Rumsfeld was here I would ask for his resignation\".\n But the movie does not show soldiers who did agree with being or supported the president / administration.\n \n 2. It shows a mother who lost her son in the war. Neither the son nor the mother supported the war to begin with and after she lost her son she hated the president even more. It did not show any family who had lost a son and still supported the war. It used the womans greif, which we should all sympathize with to further his own agenda on the wars \"meaninglessness\".\n \n 3. It shows plenty of Iraqis who are angry with the US for invading the country but it does not show one Iraqi who cheered and supported when the US came. It does not show the cherring and joy of the Iraqis when Saddam statue was gone or even leave you to think that any Iraqis were glad he was gone.\n \n 4. It does not list any of the attrocities commited by Saddam or even the charges of them. (Gassing the Kurds, torture, rape, etc...)\n \n I could go on but I don't have the time.\n \n \n Now. I have established that this is not a documentary, but rather is propoganda as is illustrated by the examples above and proven by the above definition. \n Because Michael Moore produced and narrorated 9/11 this would make him a spreader or propaganda or as I called him a propagandist.\n \n Michael Moore is a propagandist.",

The above is actually quite funny, however, it is not anything like it happened.

All he was asked to do is to let the weapons inspectors do their jobs, and he would still be in power killing an tortureing people, and that would have made you happy, wouldn't it.\n\n \n This is what we were told. The final report from the UN inspection team, as well as the reports in the months leading up to the war painted a drastically different picture. According to those last reports, the only issues the UN team had as far as how the weapons inspections were going were regarding the security around the team (everybody on the team was assigned a minder and their activities watched closely) and the fact that Iraq refused to allow them to forcibly remove Iraqi scientists from the country against their wishes. \n \n I can see their side onboth of these. First off, We do not knowingly let foreign agents wander around unescorted in America. Second, we sould certainly not let a foreign government forcibly remove one of our citizens against their will. the UN teams were allowed to interview these guys confidentially, at a location of their choice, and without oversight. I think that the government of Iraq was right to refuse to allow them to be removed from the country for \"several weeks\" (whcih is what the US was requesting) for interrogation. \n \n I think this is really the only lie that Bush actually told through the whole thing. I think he really did believe that Iraq had WMD's. I think he really did believe that once we got in there we would find AQ training camps (instead we found that Saddam had been fighting AQ for several years). He DID know when he got up there and claimed that Iraq was not cooperating with inspectors that he was lying. He would have gotten those reports from Blix sooner than anybody else. I think this is why the US gvt tried to stifle the UN report (they asked that the UN either suspend or delay its release). It would have been pretty difficult to justify his war if, on the one hand, he was standing there saying WMD's, WMD's, WMD's, and the UN report came out that clearly stated that they had already examined all the suspected production and storage facilities, followed evry lead that US intelligence had given them, checked everythiung from underground bunkers to Saddams private bathrooms (sounds rediculous, but they did) and there were no WMD's.\n \n All that was really left for the UN team to do was to check out 2 more sites (neither a suspected production or storage facility) and oversee the destruction of equipment and materials that they had already found and were holding under guard. Unfortunatly, we forced them to withdraw, and forced their guards to withdraw, so those materials are now in the hands of terrorists. Way to go.\n \n BTW. I hate Michael Moore. While I think his movie did show some images that I think AMeircans need to see (pictures actually taken in Iraq, real images of a war zone), I think that many of the conclusions he drew were idiotic and that he crossed the line between documentary and political propoganda film rather badly.",

   "mizmaxx,\n \n \nThis is the most inaccurate description of a documentary I have ever heard. Where did you get this definition? \n \n \n LoL, well usually mizmaxx when I am looking for the definition of a word I look in whats called a \"dictionary\". Perhaps you don't own one. But you can use this: \n www.dictionary.com \n \n \nFirst of all, propaganda films are a form of documentary film. (link). Second, anyone who purports to be objective in making a film is a liar. Film-making, whether documentary or fiction, is a subjective process, and everything from subject matter to editing to titles and sound effects are intended to transmit the opinion and view of the film-maker. That is what all media is about, from news to romantic comedies. \n \n \n Personally, I watch documentarys on the animal planet and they seem pretty objective to me. \n But seriously, I wouldn't expect a film to be 100% objective or 100% fair but an attempt to do so would be fair.\n If you have seen Michael Moores film you will notice that he shows no concern for showing any other side to the issues.\n \n \nFunny you should mention wartime propaganda. Have you watched the news lately?\n\n \n Pointing out alleged propaganda from CNN or FOX news does not defend Moore from my orgional statement of propagandist of which you origonally questioned.\n \n \nNone of your examples are fabrications, misquotes, or elaborately staged. This is not at all comprable with the smiling faces of Jews aboard a train to Auschwitz or playing ball at Dashau. \n \n \n It illustrates how the movie is not fair and fits the definition of propaganda.\n \n But maybe you would be more satisfied with putting the administrations faces in cowboy style films. Which he does. \n \n \nYour objection to Micheal Moore's piece does not support the idea that it is propaganda. In fact, all you have shown is that the documentary is showing a side to the war which the rest of the newsmedia are consistently ignoring. The \"balance\" you speak of is greatly held by the pro-war side, so there is absolutely no need to include this view in the film. Just as with the Nazis, the pro-war side has flooded the media with a one-sided message- the people with power want the war to happen. Whether or not you agree with Micheal Moore, the argument that his documentary is \"one-sided\" does not stand.\n\n \n I'd contest that and point out how the media the vast majority of the time only reports on the bad news out of Iraq, but I don't think you would care.\n \n There are tons of media propaganda networks. Fox is to the right of the center, CNN is to the left. AJ reports biased for Palestinians and Jerusalem Post reports biasedly for Israelis.\n \n Again whether or not you agree with him Michael Moore is a propagandist. I obviously disagree with him. But there are also people I do agree with who I don't mind admitting propagandists such as Bill Oreily, and Hannity (Hannity and Colmes). \n \n Have you seen Michael Moore's movie? \n If not then how can you say it is not propaganda? \n \n See it for yourself and hopefully you'll realize the obvious truth that it IS propaganda.",

   "wow, mikey moore started all this? he did exactly what he wanted.\n so it may seem from that, that he is brilliant\n \n i disagree with a LOT of what moore advocates (esp. gun control)\n \n but the movie he put out (in all it's extremely slanted glory) is quite necessary\n \n i went to see the movie fully aware that Moore is a propagandist\n \n I could see where he slanted the facts to make Bush look bad, in fact that's why I went to see the movie. Bush's manner and things he says makes him a perfect target for spoofing, and I thought I was going to be entertained by 2 hours of Bush spoofing.\n \n Instead there was about 1/2 hour of Bush spoofing, and the rest of the movie was just depressing. Many of the people around me were crying during some parts (moore's genius?). \n \n The movie was necessary to show the things happening in Iraq that the news will not show, and talk radio will not discuss. Showing the degree of civilian casualties and destruction of whole neighborhoods by bombing, dead babies and children, crying mothers holding their dead children on top of the rubble pile that was their house. One scene shows Rummy describing the accuracy of smart bombs. The scene then cuts to an enormous explosion that looks like its wiping out a whole city block. This is why the film was put out.\n \n Another part of the movie which shows things the news will not deal with the corporations that stand to profit from the war, all of which the Bush family or friends are invested in. I'm not saying that profit is bad, or that you can't make money in the middle of a war, but the movie laid it out in such a way that it was hard not to see that oil was a major reason for colonizing Iraq and that Bush's family and connections stand to profit immensely from it.\n \n Moore is a propagandist/shockumentary maker. Anyone with a mind can see through his tactics, but even when you do that with this move, it's difficult to see the war in Iraq as anything but one big ruse on the world.",
