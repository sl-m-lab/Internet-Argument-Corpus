   "Hello,\n \n On 5/19/6 (in a forum here discussing abortion), the following exchange took place: \n I had said that (barring immune/accidental/criminal mishaps), we don't need health care funds. To which\n \"Quote:\n Originally Posted by Bell\n We don't need health care funds? I don't understand. Seriously-I'm not beating you up here-I really would like you to clarify what you mean. Maybe  I can be better off for what you say.\"\n and \n my response was: \"Hi Bell,\n Well, that would fit best in another thread, in case you're genuinely interested... I can start one on it.\"\n \n For starters, let me say that, amongst the most intelligent & forward Thinkers it is widely accepted that everything, each & all of what we know, really comes down to 'Perceptions, aka Beliefs' (as we are not capable of really knowing absolute truth. So, even the most die-hard atheist lives by faith :)) - \n \n As a christian, or follower-of-Christ<--this is the Belief in my repertoire, that is 'subject to change' not. \n \n Everything else, is open for change... provided: (beyond not harming/hurting anyone), the Belief is benevolent, positive, constructive, generative, useful, helpful..., & especially fun ones :) \n With these conditions in mind: \n 1. What *Health-wise*, do you want?\n and\n 2. How can you learn to develop/grow as you want?\n Might you agree these 2 questions are good to carefully consider as openers :) \n \n Annie",

   "How in the world does any of that shtuff answer the question of:\n \n We don't need health care funds?\n \n Now I don't understand either. I'm not sure if I should ask you to \"dumb it down\" a little for us simple folk, or learn to construct an argument in a clear and concise manner as an intelligent adult would. emoticon_wow\n \n Ohhh....and I can use green print too. emoticon_ic",

   "I think...and I'm going out on a limb here...that you mean that:\n \n 1. People are closed minded about health care due to many reasons, such as media, doctors, perceptions of 'alternative' medicine, etc.\n \n 2. We can find ways to eliminate harmful, standard medical treatments by being more open minded and using alternative, holistic, \"faith\" based, therapies that do not rely heavily on drugs and pharmaceuticals and our wallets, but we are prohibited from studying them more because of this closemindedness.\n \n Is that what you mean? \n \n I beg you to please refrain from using colors and symbols; they do not assist your comments in any way but to be distracting. I believe you have some interesting things to say, but it's difficult to get to them. \n \n \nThat view is popular, it is true, however it is also quite weak philosophically, and tends to devolve into a self-defeating relativism when subjected to even the slightest scrutiny.\n\n \n I only have a BA, Symbiote, so quit using these big words and complex ideas. :) Could you please explain how it is weak philosophically and devolves into a self-defeating relativism?",

   "Someone who consistently adheres to the idea that nothing can be known and that access to truth is dependent on faith must admit that all claims they are making are without real basis, including claims about the state of knowledge itself.\n \n In other words, they are taking the idea that all ideas are built on faith, on faith, and can not rule out on any logical basis the idea that other people may have ideas not built on faith. In fact they are prevented from making any strong claims about reality by the nature of their philosophy of knowledge, to the extent it makes discussion about these issues with them pointless except as a social excercise.",
