   "1) the triune God\n\n \n The First Council of Nicaea, which took place during the reign of the emperor Constantine in 325 AD, was the first ecumenical (from Greek oikumene, \"worldwide\") conference of bishops of the Christian Church.\n \n The purpose of the council (also called a synod), was to resolve disagreements in the church of Alexandria over the nature of the godhead, and in particular whether the second person of the Trinity was like or unlike the first. Bishop Alexander of Alexandria took the first position; the popular presbyter Arius, from whom the term Arian controversy comes, took the second. The council decided against the Arians. Another result of the council was an agreement on the date of Easter, the most important feast of the Church's life. The council decided in favour of celebrating Easter on the first sunday after the spring equinox, independently of the Jewish Calendar and authorised the bishop of Alexandria to annually announce the exact date to his fellow bishops.\n \n The Council of Nicaea was historically significant because it was the first effort to attain consensus in the church through an assembly representing all of Christendom.1 \"It was the first occasion for the development of technical Christology\".2 Further, \"Constantine in convoking and presiding over the council signaled a measure of imperial control over the church.\"3 With the creation of the Nicene Creed, a precedent was established for subsequent general councils to create a statement of belief and canons which was intended to become orthodox for all Christians. It would serve to unify the Church and provide a clear guideline over disputed matters on what it meant to be a practicing Christian, a momentous event in the history of the Church and subsequent history of Europe.\n \n From Wikipedia:\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea\n \n Gregory's creed will follow in the next post.",

   "Also from Wikipedia:\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creed\n \n A creed as a catalogue of heresies\n In an atmosphere of increasingly complicated theological controversy, orthodox belief might become more complicated in outline. In the decade before 594, Gregory, bishop of Tours set out to write a Historia Francorum (\"History of the Franks\"). In Gaul, a part of Europe recently beset with both royal Arians and royal pagans (until the conversion of Clovis), Gregory prefaced his history with a declaration of his faith, \"so that my reader may have no doubt that I am Catholic\" (Book I.i). The confession is in many phrases, each of which refutes a specific Christian heresy. Thus Gregory's creed presents, in negative, a virtual catalogue of heresies:\n \n \nI believe, then, in God the Father omnipotent. I believe in Jesus Christ his only Son, our Lord God, born of the Father, not created. [I believe] that he has always been with the Father, not only since time began but before all time. For the Father could not have been so named unless he had a son; and there could be no son without a father. But as for those who say: \"There was a time when he was not,\" [note: A leading belief of Arian Christology.] I reject them with curses, and call men to witness that they are separated from the church. I believe that the word of the Father by which all things were made was Christ. I believe that this word was made fresh and by its suffering the world was redeemed, and I believe that humanity, not deity, was subject to the suffering. I believe that he rose again on the third day, that he freed sinful man, that he ascended to heaven, that he sits on the right hand of the Father, that he will come to judge the living and the dead. I believe that the holy Spirit proceeded from the Father and the Son, that it is not inferior and is not of later origin, but is God, equal and always co*eternal with the Father and the Son, consubstantial in its nature, equal in omnipotence, equally eternal in its essence, and that it has never existed apart from the Father and the Son and is not inferior to the Father and the Son. I believe that this holy Trinity exists with separation of persons, and one person is that of the Father, another that the Son, another that of the Holy Spirit. And in this Trinity confess that there is one Deity, one power, one essence. I believe that the blessed Mary was a virgin after the birth as she was a virgin before. I believe that the soul is immortal but that nevertheless it has no part in deity. And I faithfully believe all things that were established at Nic\u00e6a by the three hundred and eighteen bishops. But as to the end of the world I hold beliefs which I learned from our forefathers, that Antichrist will come first. An Antichrist will first propose circumcision, asserting that he is Christ; next he will place his statue in the temple at Jerusalem to be worshipped, just as we read that the Lord said: \"You shall see the abomination of desolation standing in the holy place.\" But the Lord himself declared that that day is hidden from all men, saying; \"But of that day and that hour knoweth no one not even the anger in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father alone.\" Moreover we shall here make answer to the heretics [note: the Arians] who attack us, asserting that the Son is inferior to the Father since he is ignorant of this day. Let them learn then that Son here is the name applied to the Christian people, of whom God says: \"I shall be to them a father and they shall be to me for sons.\" For if he had spoken these words of the only*begotten Son he would never have given the angels first place. For he uses these words: \"Not even the angels in heaven nor the Son,\" showing that he spoke these words not of the only-begotten but of the people of adoption. But our end is Christ himself, who will graciously bestow eternal life on us if we turn to him.\n",

   "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athanasian_Creed\n \n The Athanasian Creed (Quicunque vult) is a statement of Christian doctrine traditionally ascribed to St. Athanasius, Archbishop of Alexandria, who lived in the 4th century. However most of today's historians agree that in all probability it was originally written in Latin, not in Greek, and thus Athanasius cannot have been the original author. Its theology is closely akin to that found in the writing of western theologians, especially Ambrose of Milan.\n \n It was designed to overcome Arianism. Liturgically, this Creed was recited at the Sunday Office of Prime in the Western Church; it is not used in the Eastern Church.\n \n Today the Athanasian Creed is rarely used even in the Western Church. When used, one common practice is to use it once a year on Trinity Sunday:\n \nWhoever wants to be saved should above all cling to the catholic faith. \n Whoever does not guard it whole and inviolable will doubtless perish eternally. \n Now this is the catholic faith: We worship one God in trinity and the Trinity in unity, neither confusing the persons nor dividing the divine being. \n For the Father is one person, the Son is another, and the Spirit is still another. \n But the deity of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is one, equal in glory, coeternal in majesty. \n What the Father is, the Son is, and so is the Holy Spirit. \n Uncreated is the Father; uncreated is the Son; uncreated is the Spirit. \n The Father is infinite; the Son is infinite; the Holy Spirit is infinite. \n Eternal is the Father; eternal is the Son; eternal is the Spirit: \n And yet there are not three eternal beings, but one who is eternal; \n as there are not three uncreated and unlimited beings, but one who is uncreated and unlimited. \n Almighty is the Father; almighty is the Son; almighty is the Spirit: \n And yet there are not three almighty beings, but one who is almighty. \n Thus the Father is God; the Son is God; the Holy Spirit is God: \n And yet there are not three gods, but one God. \n Thus the Father is Lord; the Son is Lord; the Holy Spirit is Lord: \n And yet there are not three lords, but one Lord. \n As Christian truth compels us to acknowledge each distinct person as God and Lord, so catholic religion forbids us to say that there are three gods or lords. \n The Father was neither made nor created nor begotten; \n the Son was neither made nor created, but was alone begotten of the Father; \n the Spirit was neither made nor created, but is proceeding from the Father and the Son. \n Thus there is one Father, not three fathers; one Son, not three sons; one Holy Spirit, not three spirits. \n And in this Trinity, no one is before or after, greater or less than the other; \n but all three persons are in themselves, coeternal and coequal; and so we must worship the Trinity in unity and the one God in three persons. \n Whoever wants to be saved should think thus about the Trinity. \n It is necessary for eternal salvation that one also faithfully believe that our Lord Jesus Christ became flesh. \n For this is the true faith that we believe and confess: That our Lord Jesus Christ, God's Son, is both God and man. \n He is God, begotten before all worlds from the being of the Father, and he is man, born in the world from the being of his mother -- \n existing fully as God, and fully as man with a rational soul and a human body; \n equal to the Father in divinity, subordinate to the Father in humanity. \n Although he is God and man, he is not divided, but is one Christ. \n He is united because God has taken humanity into himself; he does not transform deity into humanity. \n He is completely one in the unity of his person, without confusing his natures. \n For as the rational soul and body are one person, so the one Christ is God and man. \n He suffered death for our salvation. \n He descended into hell and rose again from the dead. \n He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. \n He will come again to judge the living and the dead. \n At his coming all people shall rise bodily to give an account of their own deeds. \n Those who have done good will enter eternal life, \n those who have done evil will enter eternal fire. \n This is the catholic faith. \n One cannot be saved without believing this firmly and faithfully.\n",

It was originally called by Emperor Constantine in order to address the challenges posed by Arianism. The council established the foundations of orthodox Christian belief with the Nicene Creed: \n \n We believe (I believe) in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible. And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, and born of the Father before all ages. (God of God) light of light, true God of true God. Begotten not made, consubstantial to the Father, by whom all things were made. Who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven. And was incarnate of the Holy Ghost and of the Virgin Mary and was made man; was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate, suffered and was buried; and the third day rose again according to the Scriptures. And ascended into heaven, sits at the right hand of the Father, and shall come again with glory to judge the living and the dead, of whose Kingdom there shall be no end. And (I believe) in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of life, who proceeds from the Father (and the Son), who together with the Father and the Son is to be adored and glorified, who spoke by the Prophets. And one holy, catholic, and apostolic Church. We confess (I confess) one baptism for the remission of sins. And we look for (I look for) the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come. Amen.\"",

Furthermore, some assert that if God wanted us to believe in the Trinity He would have stated the doctrine clearly.\n \n\n \n It's curious that nobody has mentioned the fact that the idea of a trinity of gods was commonplace in ancient times. All pagan religions from the time of Babylon adopted a triad of gods in one form or another. In Babylon, it was Nimrod, Semiramus, and Tammuz; the ancient Egyptians worshipped Osiris, Isis, and Horus in the form of a trinity; in Greece, Zeus, Athena, and Apollo had the same status; the Romans identified Jupiter, Mercury, and Venus as a triad; the Hindu religion to this day has the trinity of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva.\n \n Thus, long before the founding of Christianity the idea of a triune god or a god-in-three persons was a common belief in ancient religions. Although many of these religions had a variety of minor gods and goddesses, they distinctly acknowledged that there was one supreme God who consisted of three persons or essences. \n \n What this suggests is that if paganism was conquered by Christianity, it is equally true that Christianity was corrupted by paganism. The pure Deism of the primitive Christians was transformed by pagan adulteration into the incomprehensible dogma of the Trinity.\n \n A trinitarian doctrine gradually evolved and gained credibility in late first, second and third centuries as pagans, who had converted to Christianity, brought to Christianity some of their pagan beliefs and practices. \n \n No theological ingenuity can quite obliterate all traces of these unfortunate precedents to the doctrine of the Holy Trinity.",

   "Christianity Borrowed from Paganism?\n \n It's important to realize that such charges of Christian dependence on paganism are on the downswing among contemporary scholars in the fields of classics and Biblical studies. Ronald Nash, one-time professor of philosophy, surveys the state of scholarly opinion over the past century on this issue. Although such charges were common from about 1890 to 1940, the scholarly books and articles written in reply made such claims appear much less frequently: \"Today, in the mid-1980s, most Bible scholars regard the question as a dead issue.\" William Craig, another professor of philosophy, recently declared: \"I know of no reputable New Testament scholar or historian today who would any longer defend the view that the Christian ideas of the resurrection were derived from parallels of pagan religions.\" Even in 1956, the Swedish scholar H. Riesenfeld labeled such appeals as outdated. True, as Morey notes, standard brand theological liberalism hangs onto such claims, such as Bultmann's Gnostic dependency thesis. Scholars in other fields still circulate these charges in ignorance of their refutation elsewhere, but this perspective is plainly on the defensive. Even the likes of Robin Lane Fox, a determined enemy of Christianity, denies that paganism and Christianity are fundamentally alike in a book (Pagans and Christians) that compares the two side-by-side. \n \n http://www.lionofjudah1.org/Bookhtml/Paganism%20influence%20issue%20article%20Journal%20013003.htm\n \n Refuting Mithra and other Pagan Claims\n \n http://www.geocities.com/metagetics/JCMyth_1.html",

Not a very scholarly approach, EZ.\n \n \nIf anything, Christianity was the offspring of Judaism, which itself was at direct odds with paganism (numerous Old Testament examples).\n \n \n Many of the ANE religions, almost all of which pre-date Judaism/Christianity, worshipped a sky god (or gods) who sometimes came down to earth. You will find this same concept throughout the Bible, from Genesis to Revelation. \n \n As early as 14th century BCE, the people of Mesopotamia celebrated the festival of the new year by killing a scapegoat for the forgiveness of the prior year's transgressions. Sound familiar? See Lev. 16.\n \n The Babylonian Enuma Elish (12th century BCE) recounts the creation of the world from a formless watery waste, as does Gen. 1:2 much later. \n \n The Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh (circa 19th century BCE) contains a flood story with several details found in the later Genesis story. \n \n El was the chief god of the Canaanites. The god of the Bible introduces himself to Abraham as El Shaddai (God of the Mountain) (Gen. 17:1). We see the name preserved, as well, in Isra-El, Ishma-El, and Beth-El. \n \n Judaism recognized the existence of other gods...\n \n Ps 82:1 God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods. How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy. Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked.\n \n The library of Ashurbanipal contains clay tablets on which are inscribed the poem of Tabi-utul-Enlil, the Babylonian Job. The story is strikingly similar to that of the biblical Job.\n \n Again, from Gilgamesh, consider the following...\n \n Thou, O Gilgamesh, fill thy belly;\n Day and night be thy merry;\n Day and night be joyus and content!\n Let thy garments be pure,\n Thy head be washed; wash thyself with water!\n Regard the little one who takes hold of thy hand;\n Enjoy the wife in thy bosom.\n \n ...as compared with the biblical book of Ecclesiastes... \n \n Ec 9:7 Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works.

   "What doctrines of Christianity are you talking about? Liberal doctrines? Non-Biblical doctrines? Biblical doctrines? The latter stands apart from pagan corruption, IMO.\n\n No doubt you will correct me if I misrepresent you, but what you seem to be claiming, in general, is that no significant fragments of pagan tradition, mysticism, or belief has been assimilated by Christianity. In particular, you deny that the doctrine of the trinity is a variation on the pagan theme of a triad of gods.\n \n Whether the options you list here offer anything more than minor adjustments in perspective on the matters of Christian doctrine being examined, I am not able to judge: I suspect for the purposes of this discussion, they are likely to be distinctions without differences. Let's just say that from the point of view of orthodox Christianity, despite objective evidence to the contrary, would you be prepared to argue that the doctrine of the trinity is quite uncontaminated by any pagan \"corruption\" whatever ? (You'll observe that I'm trying to corner you in this particular; but it is necessary that you should be interrogated on this point and not allowed to dance around the inquiry with Biblical tangents).\n \n Irrespective of its true provenance, the doctrine of the Trinity seems to be redundant on the grounds that a belief in monotheism, using the principle of Occam's Razor, does not require a complication of three persons in one deity: a complication which seems to add nothing vital to the belief system being adopted.

   "The stories drawn from these various sources do not always agree, and different versions of a legend naturally resulted from the ambiguities of oral transmission and the fancy of the narrator. With these qualifications, we can perhaps isolate the following \"facts\" concerning Dionysus and compare them with the story of Jesus Christ.....(examples follow).\"\n\n \n The following is in response to your \"best\" example of a pagan \"Christ-like\" figure\"\n \n 1) Dionysos was not born of a virgin.  \n \n The Greek god Dionysos is said to be the god of wine, actually he began as a fertility god in Phrygian and in Macedonia, Thrace, and other outlying regions. The origin of the cult is probably in Asia. (Charles Seltman, The Twelve Olympians, New York: Thomas Y. Corwell Company, 1960.) \n \n \"In the myths about Dionysos the most important is the tale of his birth. His mother was Semele...in fact she was an earth godess...the usual form of the story is that Zeus loved Semele and consorted with her....\" (Ibid, 171). Hera, of course was jealous and tricked the girl into asking Zeus to show himself to her in his true from. She was fried by his thunderbolts which cannot help but constantly shoot from his true form, but Zeus was able to save the child that she carried. I can find no authority who says that Dionysos mother was a virgin. But this is one of the tricky ones, she may have known no mortal man, but she was not the product of virginal conception. She was also not mortal herself, so the idea of her having a Virginal conception is out of the question, because whatever she did would be supernatural anyway, and we don't' know what gods she dated before Zeus. \n \n 2) Dionysos not laid in a manger.\n \n There is one very tiny aspect of a manger-like thing in the Dionysos myth, and it is not very central. A flower basket which could double as a crib was used as one of many fertility symbols. In fact there is no real manger connection at all. Near the end of the 5th century BC the Greek Euripides wrote a play, The Bacchae, one of the major sources of Dionysian mysteries. I've seen skeptics claim that he was laid in a manger at his birth. But he was not, he was laid in Zeus's thigh until he came to term and there is no manger scene at all (Stelman,171). \n \n 3) Title \"Son of god\" Other similarities.  \n \n Euripides does refer to Dionysos as \"son of god.\" But that is just profanatory. In mythology gods were like people, they were born, they had parents, and they lived in families. Why? Probably because people do. The phrase \"son of god\" and the general concept may be \"influenced\" by paganism in a general sense (see above) but the specific notion of Jesus' incarnation is totally different. Jesus is the incarnation of the divine logos, the second person of the Trinity, God incarnate.He is the incarnation of the rational that created the universe; not a mythological demigod, the offspring of a god and mortal. Besides that, the term \"Son of God\" in Judaism of Jesus' day was understood as a Euphemism for the Messiah. \n \n 4) Dionysos Dying and Rising.\n \n In some stories Dionysos is torn apart by the Titans. IN other stories it is Hera's orders that he be torn apart. But he was torn apart, not crucified. Moreover, since he was not an historical figure he was not a flesh and blood man. He did not really die, and his resurrection is not really bodily. His dying and rising are an echo of the death of plant life and fertility in winter and his rising is the rising of the plants in the Spring. \"He was the vine which is always pruned as nothing else which bears its fruit; every branch cut away, only the bare stock left, through the winter a dead thing to look at...he was always brought back to life...\" (Edith Hamilton, Mythology, Mentor edition, original copywriter 1940, pp. 61-62). Hamilton says that his rising did offer hope of new life, the immortality of the soul. \"He was the assurance that death does not end all.\" \n \n But this is very different from the historical claims of Christ's resurrection. Dionysos did not have an historical existence, no empty tomb, no flesh and no bloody body seen and felt by witnesses afterward. He is merely the archetype suggested by seasons, the human wish for a rejuvenation and the circularity of nature.\n \n \"In Christianity everything is made to turn on a dated experience of a historical Person; it can be seen from I Cor. XV. 3 that the statement of the story early assumed the form of a statement in a Creed. There is nothing in the parallel cases which points to any attempt to give such a basis of historical evidence to belief\" A. D. Nock (Early Gentile Christianity and Its Hellenistic Background\", 1964, p. 107). \n \n 5) Not a savior  \n \n Moreover, the followers of Dyonius did not gain their sense of eternal life from Dyonius himself, nor form his death, but from their own drunken ecstasy in the \"B\u00e9chamel.\" (Yamauchi, in \"Easter: Myth, Hallucination or History,\" and c.f. M. Nilsson, The Dionysiac Mysteries of the Hellenistic and Roman Age, 1957).\n \n His death was not an atonement and his resurrection has not even the semblance of an historical, much less history making aspect.\n \n http://www.geocities.com/metagetics/JCMyth_1.html\n \n Alan, I am unaware of any legitimate scholar of antiquity who believes that Dionysos was a real person. Conversely, Jesus was real, and not a myth. There are identified eyewitnesses who are credible and who wrote about him. So I'm afraid the comparison leaves a lot to be disired. In addition, there's no evidence that early Christianity \"borrowed\" the concept of Christ from the pagans. Rather, there is an independent stream of Messianic prophecies, etc., from Judaism.

Jealous Hera appeared to Semele and convinced her rival to trick Zeus into revealing himself to her in the full magnificence of his divinity. Thus Semele was burned to a cinder by the splendor of Zeus and his lightning flash. Their unbom child was saved by Zeus, who sewed him up in his own thigh to be born again at the proper time. As a divine child, Dionysus was brought up by nymphs and Semele's sister Ino on a mountain named Nysa, variously located. Dionysus brings happiness and salvation to those who accept him peacefully and madness and death to those who do not. \n \n\n \n Thanks for playing. Dionysus brings salvation.",

However, to the impartial observer, pagan beliefs about dying and reviving gods, which Frazer examines so thoroughly in \"The Golden Bough\", are at least highly suggestive of Christian/pagan parallels if not direct influences. \n \n It would be impertinent of me to expect you as a committed Christian to admit that the myth of Dionysus (and there are other relevant examples in Egyptian and Persian mythology) is, in certain respects, a close cousin to the gospel story. But I think some of the limited concessions in your analysis of my \"effort\" reveal a scintilla of doubt.\n \n A mere footnote: I notice that for someone who calls himself Easyrider, you seem to have a hard-riding preaching style.

   "Educating Trebor on Justification - Part 1\n \n JUSTIFICATION\n \n Justification: \"1: the act, process, or state of being justified by God; 2. the act or an instance of justifying.\" (Webster 628)\n \n Justification: \"To justify or make just, by which sanctification is included under justification; to set right; correct a wrong thing done; to deem right or approve. Justification is, in Pauline language, synonymous with reconciliation. God is not imputing to men their trespasses, but declaring them righteous. The means (of justification) is the vicarious expiatory death of Jesus Christ. The sole condition is faith ... in Jesus Christ.\" (Hastings 510)\n \n Justification: \"To prove or show to be just; to vindicate as right; to declare free from guilt or blame; to absolve, to clear; to pardon or clear from guilt; to acquit; declare righteous; pronounce sentence of acceptance.\" (Conner 269) Conner goes on to quote J.R. Gregory (\"The Theological Student\"), who defines justification as, 'That act of God by which He accepts as righteous the penitent sinner who believes on Christ for salvation.\"\n \n With the above definitions and quotes as our starting point, we can now delve into one of the most dynamic and unselfish works in the history of creation - the work of Jesus Christ, who became our righteousness because we had none of our own. Author Kevin Conner explains it this way:\n \n \"When Adam sinned, all that he was and all that he did was 'imputed' to the whole, unborn human race. Sin left a debit on the books (Genesis 3:1-16; 2:17; Romans 5:12; 6:23). In Adam all sinned, and all died, spiritually and physically (I Corinthians 15:22). When Christ died on Calvary, the sin of Adam and the whole human race was 'imputed,' or put to Christs' account. And because God imputed our sin to Christ, He suffered our penalty, which was death. All our liabilities were transferred to Him....(and) Christ's righteousness was 'imputed' to us. His righteousness is credited to us, put to our account (Psalm 32:8; Romans 4:8). Justification pronounces the sinner legally innocent, freeing him from condemnation.\" (Conner 272) \n \n Romans chapters 3-4 contain the magnificent statements of justification for those who place their faith in Jesus Christ. Romans 3:21-22 states:\n \n \"But now a righteousness from God, apart from (observing) the\n law, has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets\n testify. This righteousness from God comes through faith in\n Jesus Christ to all who believe.\"\n \n A few sentences later, Paul declares, \"For we maintain that a man is justified (righteous in the eyes of God) by faith apart from observing the law.\" (Romans 3:28)\n \n In reviewing the tenets of covenant theology, we again go back to the hopeless condition of man after Adam's fall in the garden of Eden. Mankind had fallen into sin, and any meaningful, eternal communion with the Lord was gone. Not only was man mired in his sin with no means of extrication, but his normal, carnal disposition precluded his even desiring to seek after God (Romans 3:11). Only God had the power to set man right, and He chose to do it through the Mediator of the New Covenant, His Son, Jesus Christ. \n \n (continued)",

   "Justification - Part 2\n \n In Systematic Theology, Wayne Grudem makes the point that, \"the word 'justify' in the Bible indicates that justification is a legal declaration by God. Paul says, \"Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies; who is to condemn?\" (Romans 8:33-34). Grudem continues, \"In God's legal declaration of justification, He specifically declares that we are just in His sight. This (legal) declaration involves two aspects. First, it means that we have no penalty to pay for sin, including past, present, and future sins. The second part of justification is that God must declare us not to be merely natural in His sight but actually to be righteous in His sight. In fact, He must declare us to have the merits of perfect righteousness before Him.\" (Grudem 724-25)\n \n When considering the implications of legal declarations, we have to acknowledge that there is a substantial body of judicial law which was given to us by God. I'm speaking, of course, not only of the Ten Commandments, which comprises the moral law, but also the civil and ceremonial laws of the Old Testament. This 'weighty' and seemingly inflexible array of commandments can surely be viewed as a burdensome yoke of oppression for humanity. In Old and even New Testament times, man considered his salvation as being inexorably linked to his 'keeping' of the law. To the degree that he kept the Lord's rules and regulations, that was the degree to which he calculated his chances of salvation. Yet the keeping of the law was and is an exercise in futility. Paul addresses this contentious issue:\n \n \"All who rely on observing the law are under a curse, for it is\n written: 'Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do every-\n thing written in the Book of the Law.' Clearly, no one is justified\n before God by the law, because, 'The righteous will live by\n faith.\" \n \n The law was powerless to justify anyone righteous in the eyes of God for the simple reason that no mortal human was able to keep the law.\n \n \"There is no one righteous, not even one...no one who seeks God.\n There is no one who does good, not even one.\" (Romans 3:10-11)\n \n \"I declare to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he\n is obligated to obey the whole law.\" (Galatians 5:3)\n \n One might sweat out an entire lifetime trying to keep only one of God's laws, much less all of them. No, keeping the law was not the way to justification. The law had four major purposes:\n \n 1. It shows us the moral character of God\n 2. It serves as a tutor to lead us to Christ.\n 3. It is a guide for Christian living.\n 4. Knowing the law can keep us from suffering the adverse consequences of sin.\n \n SELF- JUSTIFICATION IN SCRIPTURE\n \n It seems clear from scripture that there are only two possible sources of obtaining justification: from one's own self, or from an outside source. Mark chapter 10 gives us an illustration of one man's attempt to justify himself before God (before Jesus). A rich young man is asking Jesus what he must do to inherit eternal life. In verse 18 Jesus responded by stating, \"Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.\" Jesus goes on to list a number of the Ten Commandments as the standard by which the young man must measure his actions. The young man remarked, \"Teacher, all these I have kept since I was a boy.\" To which Jesus then said, \"One thing you lack. God, sell everything you have and give it to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.\" The story ends when the young man's face fell and he went away sad, because he had great wealth. \n \n There are a number of lessons in this story. One of these was that the young man was trying to justify himself before Jesus by indicating he was \"keeping the law,\" when in reality he was in violation of the commandment not to make for one's self any idols. Money was the young man's idol, and thus he had already broken the law. Perhaps some other young man might have listened to Jesus reciting the commandments and come to realize that not only could he not keep them in the future, but he had already broken many of them in the past. The conversation might well have then taken a different turn. He might have said something like, \"Teacher, I confess that I have not kept the whole law, and I guess I need to be truthful and tell you that I don't think I can keep it in the future either. What then can I do?\" I'm fairly sure that Jesus would have told him to believe in Him, and then he will receive eternal life. One other note: later in the story of the rich young man Jesus noted that, \"It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.\" When the disciples asked, \"Who then can be saved?\" Jesus responded by saying, \"With man this is impossible, but not with God. With God, all things are possible\" (v. 27). The crux of the message was that it is impossible for a rich man to justify himself, especially when he is engaging in idol worship. Though man might possess great wealth, and achieve tremendous influence in the worldly system, he still has two major problems: one, he still is unable to keep the law; and two, he is completely helpless in justifying himself before God - he needs divine assistance. Only God can justify a person righteous. And it's not by the works of man that this is achieved, but by God's grace through faith in Jesus Christ (Ephesians 2:8-9).\n \n Two other examples of men seeking to justify themselves before God can be found in Luke 16:15 and 18:11. It is from these types of Biblical references that the Bible paints an exceedingly clear picture that man, of himself, has no means of self-justification. Only God is able to perform that work. \n \n (continued)",

   "Justification - Part 3\n \n PAUL AND JAMES - Are they in agreement with each other?\n \n Much has been said over the years about salvation, justification, and works, and their relationship to each other. I think it is best to look at this from a chronological perspective, starting with the words of the apostle Paul in Ephesians 2:8-9:\n \n \"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith - and this\n not from yourselves, it is the gift of God - not by works, so that\n no one can boast.\"\n \n Paul makes the following points:\n \n 1. You are saved by (God's) grace through faith (in Jesus Christ).\n 2. This salvation did not originate from yourselves.\n 3. It is the gift of God (therefore it cannot be earned).\n 4. This salvation is not by any type of works that a man can perform.\n \n \n Back in Romans chapter 4, Paul gave an illustration from Genesis 15:6 concerning Abraham's justification:\n \n \n \"If, in fact, Abraham was justified by works, he had something\n to boast about - but not before God. What does the scripture\n say? 'Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as\n righteousness.\" (Romans 4:2-3)\n \n Now, going forward to James chapter 2 we read:\n \n \"What good is it, my brothers, if a man claims to have faith but\n has no deeds (works)? Can such faith save him? Faith, by\n itself, if it is not accompanied by action (works - KJV), is dead.\n You foolish man, do you want evidence that faith without deeds\n is useless? Was not our ancestor Abraham considered righteous\n for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar? You\n see, a person is justified by what he does and not by faith alone.\"\n \n James is clearly referring to Genesis chapter 22 as the point where Abraham was justified righteous. What we see here is an illustration that James uses to answer those people who are claiming to have saving faith but no works. Specifically, he states, \"Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to him, 'Go, I wish you well; keep warm and well fed,' but does nothing about his physical needs, what good is it? (what good is that man's faith?)\" In effect, James is saying, \"You claim to have faith? You claim that God has saved you, put His Holy Spirit in you, and sealed you for redemption? You claim all these things and yet you let the poor go without food or clothes? What kind of a faith is that? I, James, will tell you quite frankly that if you possess the kind of saving faith that results in regeneration and changes a person's life, the Holy Spirit will do a work in you and cause you to follow the Lord's decrees (Ezekiel 36:27) and feed and clothe the poor.\" \n \n Well, what then does Paul state about works as proof that a person's life is changed? Perhaps not surprisingly, he agrees with James:\n \n \"I preached that they should repent and turn to God and prove\n their repentance by their deeds.\" (Acts 26:20)\n \n \n So why did Paul state in Ephesians that a person is saved by grace through faith, and not by works? And why did he refer to Genesis 15:6 as the point of Abraham's justification and not Genesis 22? \n \n Abraham was not saved (justified righteous) by performing works, he was performing works because he first was saved and regenerated. Works is the result of our regeneration and salvation, not the cause of it. Faith by grace is the antecedent of works. It chronologically occurs first. Once the Holy Spirit indwells a believer at the point of salvation, He starts the process of progressive sanctification (see section on sanctification), and one of the effects of the indwelling Spirit is that of causing, or compelling a person, by a change of heart and mind, to perform works of a Christian nature. James' argument addresses that time period of a person's life, following true salvation and regeneration, when good works is supposed to be in evidence. He is saying, \"Now that you claim to be saved, we should be seeing some good works out of you. However, if these good works are not apparent, then your initial faith was probably not genuine, and you were never, either in the eyes of God, nor in the eyes of man, justified righteous.\" \n \n Another way to illustrate this is to consider the thief on the cross next to Jesus - the one who stated, \"Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.\" Then Jesus responded by saying, \"I tell you the truth, today you will be with me in paradise\" (Luke 23:42-43). It was at this particular moment that the repentant thief received his salvation, and was justified righteous in the eyes of God. This particular moment would also coincide with Genesis 15:6, when Abraham believed God and it was credited (imputed to his account) as righteousness, and would also coincide with what Paul stated in Ephesians 2:8-9. Note that there is no evidence that the thief had performed any good works in his life. To the contrary, his works were more of a criminal nature than a Godly nature. That was the very reason he was being crucified. Even as he initially hung from his cross, he heaped insults on the Lord (Mark 15:32). But then the sky darkened, his pain and suffering magnified, and the words Jesus spoke on the cross hit their appointed target, and the thief had a change of heart and believed on the Lord. At that point, the thief received his salvation and justification. \n \n Now, if by some means the thief could have come down from the cross, prior to death, and continued on with his life, then eventually his saving faith would have produced good works (corresponding to Abraham in Genesis 22 and James chapter 2). There is a progression whereby salvation leads to good works. In the eyes of God, Abraham was genuinely justified righteous in Genesis 15:6. Because his faith was genuine, it produced his works in Genesis 22, whereby he was seen as being justified righteous in the eyes of men. James and Paul, though they approach the issue of justification from two different points in time and two different perspectives (the perspective of God and the perspective of man), nevertheless are in total agreement with each other.\n \n DEAD FAITH, SAVING FAITH\n \n Still another issue that coincides with James 2:14-26 involves the issue of faith. James' contention is that for faith to be real, it must at some point result in works of a Godly nature. James is therefore speaking of the type of faith that justifies a man righteous, and the type of faith that doesn't. These are sometimes referred to as \"living\" faith, and \"dead\" faith. First, we will examine the issue of \"dead\" faith. Scripture records a number of verses that speak of this kind of faith:\n \n \"Faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead faith.\"\n (James 2:17)\n \n \"Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel (of Jesus\n Christ)...by which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what\n I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.\"\n (I Corinthians 15:1-2)\n \n \"You believe (have faith) that there is one God? Good! Even the\n demons believe that - and shudder.\"\n \n A man may claim to have faith. He may have declared his faith in Jesus Christ, been confirmed in the church, been baptized, and even attends church regularly. But a man with dead faith has no Spirit-wrought love for his fellow man - his works, if any, are born out of the human spirit as opposed to having been generated by the Holy Spirit. His faith is hollow, empty, and dead. It may just have been more of an intellectual assent that Jesus Christ is real, rather than a heart-felt belief and surrender to His will. For example, you might find those in academia who investigate historical documents for encyclopedias, and who, through exhaustive research, have determined in their minds and writings that Jesus Christ was a real person. They might even say, \"Yes, I believe in Jesus Christ.\" Yet they have not accepted Him as their savior, nor surrendered their life to Him, so their \"faith\" is more of an intellectual acceptance than a heart-felt conversion. Their faith is more a matter of statement than a matter of behavior. They still reside on the thrones of their lives, rather than surrendering all to Jesus. In Luke 9:23 Jesus states,\n \n \"If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and\n take up his cross daily and follow me.\"\n \n The man with dead faith is one who, day in and day out, does his own will, and lives for himself: \"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven\" (Matthew 7:21). Dead faith cannot result in eternal salvation.\n \n Living faith, on the other hand, is a life-changing faith. Man is \"born again,\" regenerated into the likeness of Christ. Man will no longer have a continued fascination with materialism, carnality, and worldly pursuits. A living faith involves the process of progressive sanctification, where the pursuit of God takes on supreme importance in the person's life, and the refiner's fire starts to purge the earthly influence from the believer's life. \n \n In concluding this, I think it best to place in proper context the significance of works as it relates to salvation (justification), which is most clearly expressed in I Corinthians 3:11-15:\n \n \"For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ. If any man builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or straw, his work will be shown for what it is, because the day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each man's work. If what he has built survives, he will receive his reward. If it is burned up, he will suffer loss; he himself will be saved, but only as one escaping through the flames.\" \n \n The Full Life Study Bible provides these remarks on the above passage: \n \n \"HE WILL SUFFER LOSS: There is a future judgment for believers (I John 4:17) as to the degree of their faithfulness to God and the grace given to them during this life on earth (v.10; 4:2-5; 2 Cor.5:10). In that judgment there is the possibility that a believer, although receiving salvation, may experience great loss (Greek zemloo, meaning 'to suffer loss or damage'). The careless believer is in danger of suffering loss or damage in the following ways: (1) a feeling of shame at Christ's coming (2 Ti. 2:15; 1 John 2:28); (2) loss of his or her life's work for God (vv. 12-15); (3) loss of glory and honor before God (cf. Romans 2:7); (4) loss of opportunity for service and authority in heaven (Mt. 25:14-30); (5) a low position in heaven (Mt. 25:14-30); (6) loss of rewards (cf. v. 14-15); and (7) repayment for the wrong done to others (Col. 3:24-25).\n \n AS ONE ESCAPING THROUGH THE FLAMES: 'Escaping through the flames' is probably an expression meaning 'barely saved.' God will evaluate the quality of life, influence, teaching, and work in the church of each person. If his work is judged unworthy, he will lose his (heavenly) reward, yet he himself will be saved.\" ( Full Life 1755-56)\n \n Godly works do not result in justification, but are directed towards the edification and salvation of others, and eventually result in some type of heavenly rewards. For those who may have been saved just prior to death (the thief on the cross), there may not be any works to reward, yet their salvation is yet assured. It is my contention that once a person is regenerated, eventually, if they live long enough, there should be some sort of Godly works in their life (James chapter 2).",

   "\n \n \"Begotten\" (Greek monogenes) is from the root \"begat\" (Greek monos) which is used repeatedly in Gospel genealogies to indicate sonship. \n \n\n From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Son_of_God\n \n \n\n The phrase \"the only begotten son\" (John 3:16) is another rendering for \"the beloved son.\" The Septuagint translates (\"thine only son\") of Gen. 22:2 by \"thy beloved son.\" But in this translation there is apparently a special use of the root, of frequent occurrence in rabbinical literature, as a synonym of (\"choose,\" \"elect\"); the \"only begotten\" thus reverts to the attribute of the \"servant\" who is the \"chosen\" one.\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \"Salvation\" is found numerous times in the Old Testament if you want to do a search. And the concept of an afterlife is well documented in the Tanakh and Talmud. Jewish Rabbi Simmons concedes, \"The creation of man testifies to the eternal life of the soul. The Torah says, \"And the Almighty formed the man of dust from the ground, and He blew into his nostrils the SOUL of life\" (Genesis 2:7). On this verse, the Zohar states that \"one who blows, blows from within himself,\" indicating that the soul is actually part of God's essence. Since God's essence is completely spiritual and non-physical, it is impossible that the soul should die. (The commentator Chizkuni says this why the verse calls it \"soul of LIFE.\") That's what King Solomon meant when he wrote, \"The dust will return to the ground as it was, and the spirit will return to God who gave it.\" (Ecclesiastes 12:17)\"\n \n\n \n \n I see you still don't understand. OUt of context quotes from a rabbi is hardly a concession. The concept of Salvation in the jewish works is for this life, not the next one. There is no set dogma for the afterlife in the Jewish faith, although there is much speculation. It is not clearly defined. Salvation, as described by the Christian faith is not needed. Original sin , as described by the Christian relgion is non-existant. The closest is the dual concept of the\n 'Urge to do good\" vs the 'Urge to do evil\". \n \n Now, I know you can't understand, and won't admit that other people and other religions have a differnt set of assumptions and conclusions that you have, since your faith is so weak. I bet you didn't even read what you cut/paste on faith vs works in paul vs james, trying to reconcilate it :p",

   "I suppose that Christians can be thankful that it is not necessary for them to recite either the Creed of Gregory or the Athanasian Creed and perhaps the deaths of those who died for the more or less official Nicene Creed was worth protecting present-day Christians from memorizing and reciting such creeds. Or similar creeds of equal or (Gasp!) even longer lengths.\n \n http://atheism.about.com/library/gl...ldef_nicene.htm\n \n Nicene Council \n Definition: The Nicene Council, also known as First Ecumenical Council of the Catholic Church, was held in 325 and is perhaps one of the most important councils in Christian history. It was originally called by Emperor Constantine in order to address the challenges posed by Arianism. The council established the foundations of orthodox Christian belief with the Nicene Creed: \n \n We believe (I believe) in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible. And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, and born of the Father before all ages. (God of God) light of light, true God of true God. Begotten not made, consubstantial to the Father, by whom all things were made. Who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven. And was incarnate of the Holy Ghost and of the Virgin Mary and was made man; was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate, suffered and was buried; and the third day rose again according to the Scriptures. And ascended into heaven, sits at the right hand of the Father, and shall come again with glory to judge the living and the dead, of whose Kingdom there shall be no end. And (I believe) in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of life, who proceeds from the Father (and the Son), who together with the Father and the Son is to be adored and glorified, who spoke by the Prophets. And one holy, catholic, and apostolic Church. We confess (I confess) one baptism for the remission of sins. And we look for (I look for) the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come. Amen.\"\n \n I am interested in investigating the matter of the great quantities of blood that has been shed in various religions in order to arrive at the belief systems which they say they presently embrace.\n \n To me, this has been, probably, the most fascinating aspect of religion. The wars waged over aeons upon the issue of doctrine. It certainly is a bloody business.\n\n The Creed is a Key (a key to the Kingdom--Matthew 16:19)\n \n \"The Early Christian was very precisely a person carrying about a key, or what he said was a key. The whole Christian movement consisted in claiming to possess that key. It was not merely a vague forward movement, which might be better represented by a battering-ram. It was not something that swept along with it similar or dissimilar things, as does a modern social movement. It rather definitely refused to do so. It definitely asserted that there was a key and that it possessed that key and that no other key was like it; in that sense it was as narrow as you please. Only it happened to be the key that could unlock the prison of the whole world; and let in the white daylight of liberty.\n \n The Creed was like a key in three respects; which can be most conveniently summed up under this symbol. First, a key is above all things a thing with a shape. It is a thing that depends entirely upon keeping its shape. The Christian creed is above all things the philosophy of shapes and the enemy of shapelessness. That is where it differs from all that formless infinity, Manichean or Buddhist, which makes a sort of pool of night in the dark heart of Asia; the ideal of uncreating all creatures. That is where it differs also from the analogous vagueness of mere evolutionism; the idea of creatures constantly losing their shape. A man told that his solitary latchkey had been melted down with a million others into a Buddhistic unity would be annoyed. But a man told that his key was gradually growing and sprouting in his pocket, and branching into new wards or complications, would not be more gratified.\n \n Second, the shape of a key is in itself a rather fantastic shape. A savage who did not know it was a key would have the greatest difficulty in guessing what it could possibly be. And it is fantastic because it is in a sense arbitrary. A key is not a matter of abstractions; in that sense a key is not a matter of argument. It either fits the lock or it does not. It is useless for men to stand disputing over it, considered by itself; or reconstructing it on pure principles of geometry or decorative art. It is senseless for a man to say he would like a simpler key; it would be far more sensible to do his best with a crowbar.  And thirdly, as the key is necessarily a thing with a pattern, so this was one having in some ways a rather elaborate pattern. When people complain of the religion being so early complicated with theology  and things of the kind, they forget that the world had not only got into a hole, but had got into a whole maze of holes and corners. The problem itself was a complicated problem; it did not in the ordinary sense merely involve anything so simple as sin. It was also full of secrets, of unexplored and unfathomable fallacies, of unconcscious mental diseases, of dangers in all directions. If the faith had faced the world only with the platitudes about peace and simplicity some moralists would confine it to, it would not have had the faintest effect on that luxurious and labyrinthine lunatic asylum. It is enough to say here that there was undoubtedly much about the key that seemed complex; indeed there was only one thing  about it that was simple. It opened the door.\" from The Everlasting Man, G.K. Chesterton\n \n Jesus told us that he had come not to bring peace but a sword (Matthew 10:34) but at the same time he told us to love our enemies (Matthew 5:44). Puzzling. Interesting. Fascinating. \n \n Perhaps he knew that the really important things were worth dying for. Maybe he knew that the really important things were things which humans would even kill for. Actually, he experienced that first hand.",

We must all search for the truth. \n \n The Buddhist tries to make something into nothing whereas the Christian believes that something was made out of nothing. The Buddhist attempts to make the personal into the impersonal, a positive into a negative, a presence into a void. \n \n In contrast, the \"something\" of the Christian is something personal, material, concrete, spirit incarnated in flesh. The personal part is key. All of these unique, distinct, persons on earth living together are key. More specifically, the family unit of mother, father, and children are key. They are persons living in communion, living in love--a model of the Trinity--which is a communion of persons living in love. So we have more evidence of the Trinity than is often thought. It is right before our eyes. \n \n Since that time when there was an Incarnation of God in Jesus, the \"shapeless lump\" was transformed into something we can know and be intimate with...something we can interact with just as we do with each other...something that can be summed up in a Creed.

That is the first question one should ask when exploring Christianity--Did Jesus found a visible church on earth? IF so, which one?\n \n There are other questions that should follow that:\n 2.

No--Matthew 28:20, John 16:13, 1 Timothy 3:15, Ephesians 3:10 (This does not mean that some aspects of the Church or members of the Church did not need reformation. But the Church maintained the revelation of Christ in its fullness unblemished--it did not fall away from the teachings of Christ. A reformation implies a return to form--not a revolution in which an entirely different church is formed).\n \n 4.Would the church Jesus founded be unified, of one mind and one spirit? Or splintered? Unified--John 10:16, John 17:17-23, Ephesians 4:3-6, Philippians 2:2, Romans 12:5\n \n 5. Lastly, if Jesus established a church and you can identify it, as a Christian, should you be a member of it? Should you be willing to follow its teachings knowing that they are the teachings of Christ following from his authority and establishment????\n \n (The problem with the Anglican church is that it is a national  church not a universal one.

   "Did Jesus claim to be God?\n \n Among the religious leaders who have attained a large following throughout history, Jesus Christ is unique in the fact that He alone claimed to be God in human flesh. A common misconception is that some or many of the leaders of the world's religions made similar claims, but this is simply not the case. Buddha did not claim to be God; Moses never said that he was Yahweh; Mohammed did not identify himself as Allah; and nowhere will you find Zoroaster claiming to be Ahura Mazda. Yet Jesus, the carpenter from Nazareth, said that he who has seen Him (Jesus) has seen the Father (John 14:9). \n \n The claims of Christ are many and varied. He said that He existed before Abraham (John 8:58), and that He was equal with the Father (John 5:17, 18). Jesus claimed the ability to forgive sins (Mark 2:5-7), which the Bible teaches was something that God alone could do (Isaiah 43:25). The New Testament equated Jesus as the creator of the universe (John 1:3), and that He is the one who holds everything together (Colossians 1:17). The apostle Paul says that God was manifest in the flesh (I Timothy 3:16, KJV), and John the evangelist says, \"the Word was God\" (John 1:1).\n \n The united testimony of Jesus and the writers of the New Testament is that He was more than mere man; He was God. Not only did His friends notice that He claimed to be God, but so did His enemies as well. There may be some doubt today among the skeptics who refuse to examine the evidence, but there was no doubt on the part of the Jewish authorities. When Jesus asked them why they wanted to stone Him, they replied, \"For a good work we do not stone You, but for blasphemy; and because You, being a man, make Yourself out to be God\" (John 10:33, NASB). \n \n This fact separates Jesus from the other religious figures. In the major religions of the world, the teachings - not the teacher - are all-important. Confucianism is a set of teachings; Confucius is not important. Islam is the revelation of Allah, with Mohammed being the prophet, and Buddhism emphasized the principles of the Buddha and not Buddha himself. This is especially true of Hinduism, where there is no historic founder. However, at the center of Christianity is the person of Jesus Christ. Jesus did not just claim to be teaching mankind the truth; He claimed that He was the truth (John 14:6). \n \n What Jesus taught is not the important aspect of Christianity, but what is important is who Jesus was. Was He the Son of God? Is He the only way a person can reach God? This was the claim He made for Himself. Suppose this very night the President of the United States appeared on all the major networks and proclaimed, \"I am God Almighty. I have the power to forgive sin. I have the authority to raise my life back from the dead.\" He would be quickly and quietly shut off the air, led away, and replaced by the Vice-President. Anybody who would dare make such claims would have to be either out of his mind or a liar, unless he was God. This is exactly the case with Jesus.\n \n He clearly claimed all these things and more. If He is God, as He claimed, we must believe in Him, and if He is not, then we should have nothing to do with Him. Jesus is either Lord of all or not Lord at all. Yes, Jesus claimed to be God. Why should anyone believe it? After all, merely claiming to be something does not make it true. Where's the evidence that Jesus is God? The Bible gives various reasons, including miracles and fulfilled prophecy, that are intended to convince us that Jesus is the one whom He said He was (John 20:30, 31). The main reason, or the sign which Jesus himself said would demonstrate that He was the Son of God, was His resurrection from the dead. When asked for a sign from the religious leaders, Jesus replied, \"For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, so will the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth\" (Matthew 12:40, RSV). In another place He said, when asked for a sign, \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up...but He spake of the temple of His body\" (John 2:19, 21, KJV). The ability to raise His life back from the dead was the sign that separates Him not only from all other religious leaders, but also from anyone wise who has ever lived. Anyone wishing to refute the case for Christianity must explain away the story of the resurrection. \n \n Therefore, according to the Bible, Jesus proves to be the Son of God by coming back from the dead (Romans 1:4). The evidence is overwhelming that Jesus did rise from the grave, and it is this fact that proves Jesus to be God.\n \n This excerpt was taken in its entirety from the book \"Answers to Tough Questions skeptics ask about the Christian faith\" by Josh McDowell and Don Stewart, p.39.",

It does not negate the institution that the current Church has grown into being that the Revelation of Christ remains preserved and unblemished in its protection. \n \n Yet you still contend that the existence of the Church was not a provable historical fact like the destruction of Pompeii.

Has there been any archeaological evidence unearthed that you are aware of concerning a discrete group of Christians in the catacombs under Rome or perhaps Christian deaths in the circuses of Rome?\n \n Furthermore, if we look past the gospels and read Paul's writings then we see that he mentions bishops, elders, deacons, and the presbytery and also gives us evidence of appointing successors to these offices in the Church. \n \n Then we can also look to the writings of the Church Fathers. One in particular strikes me, and it only comes a few years after your writings on Pompeii in 79-- \"See that you follow the bishop, even as Jesus Christ does the Father, and the presbytery as you would the apostles; and reverence the deacons, as being the institution of God. Let no man do anything connected with the Church  without the bishop. Let that be deemed a proper Eucharist, which is either by the bishop, or by one to whom he has entrusted it. Wherever the bishop shall appear, there let the multitude also be; even as, wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church.\" St. Ignatius of Antioch, Epistle to the Smyrneans 8, A.D. 107 \n \n And although these writings are from the Church, that is all that is needed to show that there was an organized church.

It does not negate the institution that the current Church has grown into being that the Revelation of Christ remains preserved and unblemished in its protection. \n \n Yet you still contend that the existence of the Church was not a provable historical fact like the destruction of Pompeii. Interestingly, Pompeii was in the Roman Empire. Have you ever heard of the Roman persecutions of Christians? In citing Pliny the Younger for your source confirming the destruction of Pompeii, have you ever read any of his writings in which \"Christians\" are mentioned? Has there been any archeaological evidence unearthed that you are aware of concerning a discrete group of Christians in the catacombs under Rome or perhaps Christian deaths in the circuses of Rome?\n \n Furthermore, if we look past the gospels and read Paul's writings then we see that he mentions bishops, elders, deacons, and the presbytery and also gives us evidence of appointing successors to these offices in the Church. \n \n Then we can also look to the writings of the Church Fathers. One in particular strikes me, and it only comes a few years after your writings on Pompeii in 79-- \"See that you follow the bishop, even as Jesus Christ does the Father, and the presbytery as you would the apostles; and reverence the deacons, as being the institution of God. Let no man do anything connected with the Church  without the bishop. Let that be deemed a proper Eucharist, which is either by the bishop, or by one to whom he has entrusted it. Wherever the bishop shall appear, there let the multitude also be; even as, wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church.\" St. Ignatius of Antioch, Epistle to the Smyrneans 8, A.D. 107 \n \n And although these writings are from the Church, that is all that is needed to show that there was an organized church. A proof of organization could come from within or without and suffice.\n\n \n I am not trying to deny that in 1st century Palestine (I know the word \"Palestine\" may be an anachronism here) a group of religious associates or disciples of a charismatic teacher called Jesus Christ, claimed that they belonged to his \"church\". I do not deny that Christians suffered persecution under the Roman Empire or that there is archaeological evidence of their existence in the catacombs of Rome: I have seen their tombs for myself.\n \n But what I'm trying to challenge is your assertion that these original followers of Jesus established, ab initio, the religious institution we now recognise as the Catholic Church. Jesus did not command his apostles to write books or incorporate themselves as a religious sect with a specific charter. They seemed to have believed that their \"church\" could answer the spiritual questions that worried them at that particular time and in that particular place. They did not and could not anticipate the later Christian penetration of Roman culture - which, according to Gibbon, led to the decline and fall of the Roman Empire. Perhaps we can more plausibly date the foundation of the Church from the conversion of the first Christian emperor - possibly Constantine ? \n \n If we return to the Apostle's Creed again for a second, you will recall these words, \"I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins\".........etc. You probably don't need reminding that the word \"catholic\" (from the Greek root) means universal. It's obvious that the existence of so many different \"true\" Christian churches casts doubt on your claim to absolute exclusivity and/or universality. The twelve apostles did not claim they were inaugurating a \"universal\" church. So my counter-claim that the foundation of the Catholic Church is an article of faith, declared, if I remember correctly, in the Catechism of Christian Doctrine rather than a statement of objective fact about an historical event, has not been refuted (at least not yet !). For the reasons I've already given, testimony from the gospels in support of your assertions will not answer.",

   "The passage you refer to reads: Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am. (John 8:58)\n Are you really that lost that you cannot recall that I AM is the name of God given to Moses by the burning bush in Exodus 3? Have you bothered to study the original Greek and see that the comma was put in by the translator? That is not Jesus saying he is God that is Jesus saying, \"Before Abraham was God.\" \"Before Abraham existed, God exited.\" You are so lost in your own sad fears you can't even read the scriptures unless it is through the lens of your terror and anguish.\n\n \n You and Trebor are both fulminating. The translation is ego eimi. But the real clincher is that after Jesus said this, the very next verse says they \"took up stones to throw at him.\" Obviously then never would have done this if Jesus were just talking about the preexistence of God the Father. But they would if Jesus were claiming to be God. Plus, the discussion in the immediate verses preceeding John 8:58 centered on who Jesus was, not who God the Father was. You always harp on context. Try it sometime yourselves.\n \n In addition, we have \"It is I AM\" again! 3. Mark 6:51 - (Jesus walking on the water).... The literal Greek reading is, \"(It is) I AM\" - Greek ego eimi (ego = I; eimi=am). How many does it take, Howard? \n \n \n Now, Howard, concerning Jesus, did he exist before his birth?

   "Would you care to explain the period when the Catholic church preached savlation by donation? How exactly does that fit in with Christ's teaching? How does colusion with Nazi Germany?\n\n Jo,\n I will do my best to explain the period when the Catholic Church is accused  of preaching salvation by donation. Here it is from a previous debate:\n \n Firstly, indulgences were not for sell (Canon 2327 excommunicates anyone who seeks material profit from indulgences). Secondly, indulgences did not grant forgiveness. An indulgence is the remission of the debt of temporal punishment (not the eternal punishment) due to sin after its guilt has been forgiven. It is the remission of sentence of penalty and not a commutation of the sentence or penalty. The remission of debt is not the remission of guilt. An indulgence has nothing to do with the guilt of the sin. In fact, an indulgence can only be gained by one who is not in a state of sin; one who has secured forgiveness of his sins by repentance and Confession. This does nothing to detract from the eternal salvation bought for us by Christ on the cross. Even after Christ's sacrifice, we are not exempt from suffering. \n \n Scriptural foundations for indulgences can be found in Matthew 16:19, \"I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\" Jesus gave the Church the power to bind and loose, including the penalty for sin. This is the power the Church uses in granting indulgences. Paul gives us an example of remitting temporal punishment due to sin (as an indulgence does) in 2 Corinthians 2: 6-10  when he allows the man found guilty of sinning with his stepmother (1 Corinthians 5:1) back in to the church after learning of his repentance. There are many more examples in scripture where works can offset the consequences of sin (James 5:20  and 1 Peter 4:8 as well as many Old Testament verses)\n \n Indulgences can also be illustrated with a practical example. Suppose a boy throws a rock through the window of a store to win a bet with his friend (a sin). The boy feels badly after throwing the rock and confesses to the crime with an immediate apology (contrition and confession). The store manager knows the boy and he talks to the owner of the store about the incident. The owner gives the manager the permission to decide whether or not formal charges for vandalism will be pressed. The manager elects not to press charges for the indiscretion (forgiveness). However, he still has a broken window to repair (consequence of sin). He decides to let the boy work off the debt at the store by sweeping for 5 days. The boy comes in every day for 4 days on time. The boy has a very good attitude during his work. He actually helps the storeowner stock shelves and cleans out the freezer without the storeowner requiring it of him (good works/penance). Because the boy has shown a change of heart and reformed his ways the store manager cancels the debt of the remaining day (an indulgence). In effect the boy gets time off for good behavior. This does not change the fact that the boy sinned, nor is the sin abolished. Rather, the good works lessen the penalty of that sin. \n \n I acknowledge that there were abuses concerning indulgences in the time of Luther but the Church never sanctioned this. Indulgences were granted to those who would give alms towards the building of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. These people gave alms for a good work. Just as Christ gave a special blessing to the widow who gave her mite as an alm to the temple in Jerusalem, indulgences were granted to those who gave alms for St. Peter's.\n \n The Church's level of colusion with Germany during World War II depends on who you read. As much information as you can present to proclaim that Pius XII aided the holocaust, I can present to show that he didn't. Check out this website for a few articles:\n \n http://www.catholicleague.org/pius/framemain.htm \n \n Pay particular attention to the articles by Sister Margherita Marchione, Ph.D as they have a lot of concrete information and also the one by Rabbi David Dalin (there are two articles by Rabbis on the site).\n \n You might also find St. Maximilian Kolbe's  life (and death in Auschwitz) very interesting, as well as his housing of 2000 Jewish refugees during the Nazi invasion of Poland:\n \n http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/saintm01.htm \n http://www.catholic-pages.com/saints/st_maximilian.asp \n \n So we come back to the original questions:\n Did Jesus, in fact, start a church?\n What was that church?\n Would it be likely to fall away?",

   "Alan Ryan\n I am not trying to deny that in 1st century Palestine (I know the word \"Palestine\" may be an anachronism here) a group of religious associates or disciples of a charismatic teacher called Jesus Christ, claimed that they belonged to his \"church\". I do not deny that Christians suffered persecution under the Roman Empire or that there is archaeological evidence of their existence in the catacombs of Rome: I have seen their tombs for myself.\n \n But what I'm trying to challenge is your assertion that these original followers of Jesus established, ab initio, the religious institution we now recognise as the Catholic Church. Jesus did not command his apostles to write books or incorporate themselves as a religious sect with a specific charter. They seemed to have believed that their \"church\" could answer the spiritual questions that worried them at that particular time and in that particular place. They did not and could not anticipate the later Christian penetration of Roman culture - which, according to Gibbon, led to the decline and fall of the Roman Empire. Perhaps we can more plausibly date the foundation of the Church from the conversion of the first Christian emperor - possibly Constantine ? \n \n If we return to the Apostle's Creed again for a second, you will recall these words, \"I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins\".........etc. You probably don't need reminding that the word \"catholic\" (from the Greek root) means universal. It's obvious that the existence of so many different \"true\" Christian churches casts doubt on your claim to absolute exclusivity and/or universality. The twelve apostles did not claim they were inaugurating a \"universal\" church. So my counter-claim that the foundation of the Catholic Church is an article of faith, declared, if I remember correctly, in the Catechism of Christian Doctrine rather than a statement of objective fact about an historical event, has not been refuted (at least not yet !). For the reasons I've already given, testimony from the gospels in support of your assertions will not answer.\n\n Alan,\n I have previously told you that I do not believe that the institution which is now the Catholic Church sprung up at Jesus' command after he spoke the words of Matthew 16:18. This does not say that there was not a visible, organized church founded by Jesus Christ with specific doctrines embodied in a \"creed.\" \n \n The first churches were in the homes and catacombs. The Christians were persecuted by the Jews and Romans. It wasn't likely that any church buildings would go up pointing their persecutors to their location. As Christianity was more accepted, cathedrals and churches were a logical progression in worship of God, being that Christianity was founded on the Jewish faith that utilized the Temple as an honor to God (1 Kings 6). \n \n Jesus was not afraid of church. He was presented by his parents in the temple (Luke 2:27). He had an attraction to the temple as a child (Luke 2:46). He frequently taught and healed in the synagogues Matthew 4:23, 9:35, 13:54. Mark 1:21-23, 1:39, 3:1. \n \n Jesus' closest followers, the apostles all went off and established physical churches in different parts of the world, heeding his commandment (The Great Commission) in Matthew 28:18-19. \n \n It is of note that Paul's scriptures were written to the churches of various places--Rome, Corinth, Ephesus, Galatia, etc. (And Paul's writings were have been deemed the earliest written of all the scriptures so it is evident that there were churches around very early). John also begins Revelation by addressing the \"seven churches that are in Asia.\"\n \n Furthermore, the meaning of \"catholic\" is universal but that meaning in the earliest times was associated with a specific church . This is revealed in the quote from St. Ignatius of Antioch that I provided in my last post. He says that the Catholic Church is found where the bishop is. Thus the Catholic Church is a specific church embodied in the succession of bishops unbroken from the apostles. Secondly, the presence of a bishop at all demonstrates an organized church.\n \n Peace.",

   "billscoIf one were to use the New Testament as the sole piece of evidence in arguing primacy, it would seem to work against the plaintiff. In Matthew 6:6 Jesus commands that one should look for a closet when attempting to communicate with his Father. Why is this commandment not heeded? How are we to believe the same person uttered that, then a few chapters later contradicts himself by somehow giving his aegis to a world-wide institution? It just won't do.\n\n \n \nHoward Beale\n Here are only two instance: Matthew 6:5-6\n Mt 6:5: And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. 6: But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.\n \n All those services in Churches and in Vatican Square are in direct opposition to this.\n\n billsco and howard,\n Jesus would be contradicting himself if one reads this verse to mean that one should pray in a closet. Your interpretations of the verse are way off. I wonder Howard, if you pray, do you pray in a closet? How literally do you take this lesson of Jesus? He was obviously attempting to make a point. \n \n There is nothing wrong with praying in public. There is nothing wrong with repitition in prayer. There is something wrong with vain repetition. There is something wrong with hypocrisy. This was what Jesus was condemning--vain, hypocritical, attention grabbing, false prayer.\n \n Remember the verses that I previously quoted to Alan, showing Jesus did not mind religious interaction in public: He had an attraction to the temple as a child (Luke 2:46). He frequently taught and healed in the synagogues Matthew 4:23, 9:35, 13:54. Mark 1:21-23, 1:39, 3:1.\n \n Also remember Matt. 26:44  - Jesus prayed a third time in the garden of Gethsemane--not in a closet--others were present.\n \n Lastly, I wonder if the Sermon on the Mount where thousands were present would be something similar to a Vatican Square service of our times? \n \n (billsco--as to an approval of a world wide institution--Jesus commanded it--again a previously quoted verse--Matthew 28:18-19--\"go out and baptize all nations. They did exactly what Jesus said. They established a universal church that has permeated every corner of the earth).",

Shouldn't the church have already given all that money to children? It is the richest corporation in the world.\n\n The Catholic Church is one of the largest charitable organizations in the world--probaby in the top 3--it was the  largest not very long ago.\n \n The Catholic Church, along with the Orthodox, is the only one that I know of that requires its priests to take a vow of poverty. They must give up everything to serve the kingdom.\n \n Much of the vast riches of the Church is art created in praise of God. (Remeber that even more is land and property used to serve the people). But concerning the art, it is good to remember Jesus' words in Matthew 26:8-10, \n \" While Jesus was in Bethany in the home of a man known as Simon the Leper, a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, which she poured on his head as he was reclining at the table. \n When the disciples saw this, they were indignant. \"Why this waste?\" they asked. \"This perfume could have been sold at a high price and the money given to the poor.\" \n Aware of this, Jesus said to them, \"Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing to me. The poor you will always have with you, but you will not always have me. When she poured this perfume on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial. I tell you the truth, wherever this gospel is preached throughout what she has done will also be told, in memory of her.\" \n \n So by the above story we know that Jesus' command was not a universal one. He was not contradicting himself. We know that he expected some things to be kept in order to praise and worship him and other things to be kept to do the work of the Church. Remember that many times he sent his disciples to people's homes to gain lodging and food--why hadn't these homes been given up??? Also, Joseph of Arimathea donated the tomb for Jesus and was not shunned as a Christian that we can tell. He was called a \"rich\" man in Matthew 27:56-58. \n \n It is not what you have but what you do with what you have and also the fact that you could give all of it up at any moment for the sake of the Kingdom. \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God and all these things will be added unto you.\" Matthew 6:33)",

   "Howard Beale\n The teachings of Jesus are plain and simple to understand. There are few christian denominations that teach them.\n \n Mt 5: 43: Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. 44: But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; 45: That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.\n \n Most christian denominations teach \"justifiable war\". I challange anyone to find words of Jesus that justify harming another human being, let alone justifying war.\n\n Howard,\n Do you think the participation of the United States (and other allied powers)in World War II was justified? As Chesterton wrote, \"a good war is sometimes better than a bad peace.\" Sometimes war is necessary when all other avenues of defense have failed. Do you disagree?\n \n Do you see Jesus' actions in the temple--overthrowing the tables and throwing merchants out--as a \"violent\" act in any way? Was his \"violence\" justified?\n \n What is your interpretation of Jesus' words \"Do not think I have come to bring peace on earth; I have not come to bring peace but a sword...?\" (Matthew 10:34)",

   "Maximus: Somehow with my dial-up connection now, this never posted\n \n In response to 2 posts of yours on 10/5:\n \n Regarding Catholic Church teachings that I said were in contradiction to the teachings of Jesus. I note first that you did not contradict my contention that the Doctrine of Papal Infallibility was not taught by Jesus. You also did not contradict my statement that Jesus did not preach about a \"triune God.\"\n \n You quote me:\n Here are only two instances: Matthew 6:5-6\n Mt 6:5: And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. 6: But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.\n \n All those services in Churches and in Vatican Square are in direct opposition to this.\n \n \nMaximus:\n Jesus would be contradicting himself if one reads this verse to mean that one should pray in a closet. Your interpretations of the verse are way off. \n \n I wonder Howard, if you pray, do you pray in a closet? How literally do you take this lesson of Jesus? He was obviously attempting to make a point. \n \n There is nothing wrong with praying in public. There is nothing wrong with repitition in prayer. There is something wrong with vain repetition. There is something wrong with hypocrisy. This was what Jesus was condemning--vain, hypocritical, attention grabbing, false prayer.\n\n \n Jesus is clear about how to pray in Mt 6:5-6. The fact that you have a problem with it is fine. Your position is simply not a Christian one, mine is. You are entitled to your non-Christian position. I am entitled to my Christian one.\n \n \nMaximus:\n Remember the verses that I previously quoted to Alan, showing Jesus did not mind religious interaction in public: He had an attraction to the temple as a child (Luke 2:46). He frequently taught and healed in the synagogues Matthew 4:23, 9:35, 13:54. Mark 1:21-23, 1:39, 3:1.\nYour position is uninformed at best and underhanded and conniving at worst. Are you saying that \"prayer\" and \"religious interaction\" are synonymous? I will quote every verse you refer to above. What am I to believe about you when not one verse, NOT ONE  says anything about prayer or praying? Read the passages. Show me where Jesus contradicts himself in advising us about how to pray.\n \n Luke 2:46: And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions.\n \n Mt 4:23: And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.\n \n Mt 9:35: And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.\n \n Mt 13:54: And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?\n \n Mark 1:21: And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught. 22: And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes. 23: And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,\n \n Mark 1:39: And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.\n \n Mark 3: 1: And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had a withered hand.\n \n You go on to say:\n \n \nMaximus:\n Also remember Matt. 26:44 - Jesus prayed a third time in the garden of Gethsemane--not in a closet--others were present.\nThe same issue again. Do you bother to read what you site to support your position, or is it something much more malicious? Here is the verse you site:\n \n Mt 26:44: And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.\n \n Matthew 26 makes a point of saying that Jesus went off by himself to pray. Not mentioning that is highly suspect your part. It may demonstrate that you have a greater interest in having Jesus fit your preconception than in understanding what he actually said and meant. \n \n \nMaximus:\n Lastly, I wonder if the Sermon on the Mount where thousands were present would be something similar to a Vatican Square service of our times? \n Jesus was teaching not praying and you should know that if you have read the Gospels. The Pope says, \"Let us pray\" and leads prayers in Vatican Square. There is a difference.\n \n Read the words of Jesus. They are clear and simple. \n \n You quote me again:\n Second: Matthew 19:21\n Mt 19:21: Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.\n \n \nMaximus:The Catholic Church has millions to give for child abuse settlements. Shouldn't the church have already given all that money to children? It is the richest corporation in the world.\n \n The Catholic Church is one of the largest charitable organizations in the world--probaby in the top 3--it was the largest not very long ago.\n \n The Catholic Church, along with the Orthodox, is the only one that I know of that requires its priests to take a vow of poverty. They must give up everything to serve the kingdom.\nEither you have no experience with Catholic clergy or you are completely deluded. Have you ever eaten in the Vatican dining room? What about a Bishop's or Cardinal's dining hall? Have you ever seen one? Have you seen the Pope's estates in Italy? In France? The Cardinals' estates in Spain and Portugal? Are you kidding? Are you aware that Catholic clergy have been excommunicated for inferring that it is immoral that the Catholic Church has such rich \"earthly possessions\" and there are people starving? \n \n \nMaximus:\n Much of the vast riches of the Church is art created in praise of God. (Remeber that even more is land and property used to serve the people). But concerning the art, it is good to remember Jesus' words in Matthew 26:8-10, \n \" While Jesus was in Bethany in the home of a man known as Simon the Leper, a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, which she poured on his head as he was reclining at the table. \n \n When the disciples saw this, they were indignant. \"Why this waste?\" they asked. \"This perfume could have been sold at a high price and the money given to the poor.\" \n \n Aware of this, Jesus said to them, \"Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing to me. The poor you will always have with you, but you will not always have me. When she poured this perfume on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial. I tell you the truth, wherever this gospel is preached throughout what she has done will also be told, in memory of her.\" \n \n So by the above story we know that Jesus' command was not a universal one. He was not contradicting himself. We know that he expected some things to be kept in order to praise and worship him and other things to be kept to do the work of the Church. Remember that many times he sent his disciples to people's homes to gain lodging and food--why hadn't these homes been given up??? Also, Joseph of Arimathea donated the tomb for Jesus and was not shunned as a Christian that we can tell. He was called a \"rich\" man in Matthew 27:56-58. \n I am sure you know that Matthew 26 was a time that Jesus said to the disciples that his death was near. His point was that this woman was doing a charitable act. She wasn't keeping the expensive oil for herself, she used it to anoint and comfort the dying, him. To compare that to a church hoarding valuables and real estate and having its hierarchy living in luxury is a bit of a stretch.\n \n \"Land to serve people\", \"Art created in praise of God\" (what happened to the 2nd Commandment by the way), \"It is good to remember Jesus.\" You talk as if it has any meaning. Jesus told you how to remember him and it wasn't to own a bunch of painting painted by guys who never saw Jesus or Mary or half the stuff they painted. Jesus sat down and broke bread with his disciples. That's all.\n \n \nMaximus:\n It is not what you have but what you do with what you have and also the fact that you could give all of it up at any moment for the sake of the Kingdom. \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God and all these things will be added unto you.\" Matthew 6:33)\nAnd you think that \"all these things\" that will be added are riches? Million dollar paintings of Jesus? You take Jesus' words out of context. Read verses 31 and 32. They tell you that he is not talking about riches, he is talking about sustenance. \n \n Mt 6:31: Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? 32: (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.\n \n If you are going to bother to quote Jesus, have the respect to quote him in context. \n \n You can try all that you want, but you cannot deny that Jesus said, \"...go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.\" \n \n \nMaximus:\n What do you think of Paul's words in Colossians 2:9, \"that in him dwells the whole fullness of the deity bodily?\"\nAgain, as a Christian, it is the words of Jesus that are of the greatest import to me. Paul never met, saw or heard Jesus. You should also note that in the epistles of Paul that are undisputedly written by him (1 Thessalonians, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Romans, Philippians, Philemon) on only one occasion does he appeal to the authority of Jesus to support a moral teaching which the gospels also represent Jesus as having delivered. Only once in all those words.\n \n \nMaximus:\n Do you have a translation defense for John's words proclaiming Jesus' divinity in the beginning of his gospel? (John 1:1-5)\nWhoever wrote the Gospel of John can say what he wants. It is fair to say that he never met Jesus either and was not witness to the events he writes about.\n \n If Jesus is God, was he too embarrassed to say, I am God, kneel down and worship me?",

   "Howard Beale - \n \n You've asked me if I believe Jesus is who he claimed to be, because that's who you say he is also.\n \n I do. Jesus claimed to be the long-awaited Jewish Messiah, God, the one who, if you don't believe who he is, you will die in your sins; that he existed before the foundation of the earth; the way and the truth and the life, and that no one will come to the Father except through him, and a number of other claims (son of man, one with the Father, etc.).\n \n Who you you say the scriptures say he is?\nEZ:\n I respected your direct answer so much that I am wading through this dial-up modem snail-paced connection to get back to you. \n \n Similar to you, I believe that Jesus was the \"Son of God\", and that, as he said, he and the Father are one. I believe that he was born of woman (Mary), so \"Son of God\" is not a physical depiction, but a spiritual one. \"Son of Man\" is the physical depiction. As \"Son of God\" (spirit) I do believe that he exists in eternity. I think that is part of what he meant when he said, \"in this world but not of it.\" But more importantly than all that, I believe he teachings are the greatest spiritual teachings I have ever read (I would say the greatest that the world has ever seen, but I have not read everything.) Jesus' through his teachings have pointed out to us an understanding and a way of being and it is my belief that many religions have chosen worship the pointer and ignore the direction he pointed us in.",

   "To Howard Beale - r.e. the Gospel of John\n \n First, Irenaeus was a disciple of Polycarp (who was a disciple of the Apostle John), and Irenaeus testified on Polycarp's authority that John wrote his Gospel during his residence at Ephesus in Asia Minor when he was advanced in age. Clement of Alexandria also wrote that John was aware of the other Gospels and composed the Gospel of John. There's simply no credible evidence that John was not the author or that he wasn't an eyewitness to Jesus. Now there are a lot of theories about who might have written it besides John, but I haven't seen anything compelling.",

   "Howard,\nIn response to 2 posts of yours on 10/5:\n \n Regarding Catholic Church teachings that I said were in contradiction to the teachings of Jesus. I note first that you did not contradict my contention that the Doctrine of Papal Infallibility was not taught by Jesus. You also did not contradict my statement that Jesus did not preach about a \"triune God.\"\n\n I will get to these issues as time permits.\n \n \nYou quote me:\n Here are only two instances: Matthew 6:5-6\n Mt 6:5: And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. 6: But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.\n \n All those services in Churches and in Vatican Square are in direct opposition to this.\n \n Jesus is clear about how to pray in Mt 6:5-6. The fact that you have a problem with it is fine. Your position is simply not a Christian one, mine is. You are entitled to your non-Christian position. I am entitled to my Christian one.\n\n So you do pray in a closet then????????\n \n You hold the Christian position? You are a Christian who has divorced himself from the 2000 year history of Christianity? You are a Christian who has divorced himself from the major portion of traditional Christian scriptural interpretation? You are a Christian who has divorced himself from the Apostolic Church founded by Jesus Christ himself? You are a Christian who worships alone disconnected from the Body of Christ who is the community of believers? You use the term very loosely.\n \n \nYour position is uninformed at best and underhanded and conniving at worst. Are you saying that \"prayer\" and \"religious interaction\" are synonymous? I will quote every verse you refer to above. What am I to believe about you when not one verse, NOT ONE  says anything about prayer or praying? Read the passages. Show me where Jesus contradicts himself in advising us about how to pray.\n \n Luke 2:46: And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions.\n \n Mt 4:23: And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.\n \n Mt 9:35: And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.\n \n Mt 13:54: And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?\n \n Mark 1:21: And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught. 22: And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes. 23: And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,\n \n Mark 1:39: And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.\n \n Mark 3: 1: And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had a withered hand.\n \n You go on to say:\n \n The same issue again. Do you bother to read what you site to support your position, or is it something much more malicious? Here is the verse you site:\n \n Mt 26:44: And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.\n \n Matthew 26 makes a point of saying that Jesus went off by himself to pray. Not mentioning that is highly suspect your part. It may demonstrate that you have a greater interest in having Jesus fit your preconception than in understanding what he actually said and meant. \n \n Are you to be so narrow minded as to think that prayer did not accompany religious teaching and healing of the sick? You are showing yourself to be a literalist worthy of the Fundamentalists-someone you seem to distance yourself from but yet hold a lot in common with. Public prayer to show off in vanity is wrong (as Jesus said), sincere public prayer is perfectly okay. What do you think the Jews did when they gathered? Do you think before or after someone taught on scripture about God that they might have prayed? What about scripture being taught in public in the first place? Jesus was not afraid of proclaiming God in public, nor were his disciples. Silent, solitary prayer is great. But there is nothing wrong with communal, public prayer either.\n \n It is true what you say about Jesus \"going away\" to pray in the Garden. But my point is that he went off to pray with a group of men. Why did he bring the disciples with him to the garden? Why was he not in his room or closet to pray? How far did Jesus go away??? Why did he take James and John with him part of the way? Could those present see him? Could they hear him? In Matthew 26:41  why did he tell them to watch and pray while he went off? Weren't all of these men in a group together? It says nothing about them separating.\n \n Furthermore, Jesus sang a hymn with the apostles before leaving for the Garden after the Last Supper (Matthew 26:30). What do you think that hymn was about? What is a hymn? Is it a prayer?\n \n A few other questions come up in regard to open, public prayer:\n \n Why did Jesus tell people to gather in his name? Matthew 18:20  \"For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I in the midst of them.\"\n \n What did Jesus mean when he said, \"Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.\" Matthew 5:16\n \n Have you ever heard of the Beatitudes? Jesus announced them in the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 5:3-11. Are blessings prayers?\n \n In Matthew 26:26  Jesus blessed the bread. Again, what is a blessing but a prayer? Is a prayer before meals in public violating Jesus' commands?\n \n **** In Matthew 19:13 Jesus laid hands on children and PRAYED for them. Was this a public prayer?\n \n If we were to be isolated in our prayer then why did Jesus teach us to pray Our  Father instead of My  Father? Since the Our Father is a \"prayer\" taken right out of scripture then is it prayer or teaching of scripture when it is recited?\n \n Did Jesus condemn all public prayer of Jews or just that of the Pharisees that was vain and hypocritical? (Luke 1:10, Luke 2:37 , I doubt he would condemn Zechariah, his uncle, the father of John the Baptist, or the widow)\n \n If prayer was only to be in isolation as instructed by Jesus then why did his inner circle meet to \"break bread\" commemorating the Lord's Supper in the book of Acts? I find it hard to believe that no prayers would have been said at those gatherings. I find it hard to believe that all of those learning directly from Jesus would have gotten the message wrong.(Acts 20)\n \n \nJesus was teaching not praying and you should know that if you have read the Gospels. The Pope says, \"Let us pray\" and leads prayers in Vatican Square. There is a difference.\n \n Read the words of Jesus. They are clear and simple. \n \n How clear and simple are they? Do you follow Jesus' teaching to break bread and drink wine in his memory?\n \n Do you have a church to take your issues to if you can't resolve them with your brother? Matthew 18:18\n \n Have you followed Jesus' command to be baptized?\n \n \nYou quote me again:\n Second: Matthew 19:21\n Mt 19:21: Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.\n \n Either you have no experience with Catholic clergy or you are completely deluded. Have you ever eaten in the Vatican dining room? What about a Bishop's or Cardinal's dining hall? Have you ever seen one? Have you seen the Pope's estates in Italy? In France? The Cardinals' estates in Spain and Portugal? Are you kidding? Are you aware that Catholic clergy have been excommunicated for inferring that it is immoral that the Catholic Church has such rich \"earthly possessions\" and there are people starving? \n \n I am sure you know that Matthew 26 was a time that Jesus said to the disciples that his death was near. His point was that this woman was doing a charitable act. She wasn't keeping the expensive oil for herself, she used it to anoint and comfort the dying, him. To compare that to a church hoarding valuables and real estate and having its hierarchy living in luxury is a bit of a stretch.\n \n \"Land to serve people\", \"Art created in praise of God\" (what happened to the 2nd Commandment by the way), \"It is good to remember Jesus.\" You talk as if it has any meaning. Jesus told you how to remember him and it wasn't to own a bunch of painting painted by guys who never saw Jesus or Mary or half the stuff they painted. Jesus sat down and broke bread with his disciples. That's all.\n\n The church cannot be narrowed into extremes as you wish it to be. The Church is universal. It is all things to all men. \n \n You don't understand that there are many paradoxes of Christianity and no contradictions of Christianity. Both the beautiful and expansive riches of the Church and her men and women taking vows of poverty are signs of the Kingdom of Heaven. They are an image, a sacrament, a symbol, pointing to something higher than itself. The richness of some of the cathedrals for example is due to more than show. It is due to praise of God and to be a sign pointing us to God. That is why they are massive-they have verticality pointing us to heaven, iconography telling us the story of salvation, and permanence--they are made of the best materials that will last just as long as the Kingdom of Heaven--eternally. They point us to the banquet, majesty, and joy of heaven. At the same time the poverty of the Franciscans, the Poor Clares, the Missionaries of the Poor, and Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity show us the good of giving up earthly things for a higher yearning of something supernatural and outside of earth. Where can you find this sacrifice in any other church outside of the Catholic Church? Both are right. Both are true. \n \n ARE YOU LIVING IN POVERTY? HAVE YOU GIVEN UP ALL TO LIVE A CHRISTIAN LIFE? DO YOU HAVE A COMPUTER TO TYPE ON? YOU ARE THE ONE WITH THE CHRISTIAN POSITIONS CORRECT? I AM THE ONE PROPOSING THE NON-CHRISTIAN POSITIONS CORRECT? Do you uphold the same standard that you require of the Catholic Church or do you propose this simply to discredit the Church? Do you own a car? A house? More than one set of clothing? Do you have a job to work for meals? Or does the Lord provide all for you?  \n \n You likely cannot find this ideal of poverty for the kingdom in yourself although you condemn the Church for not fulfilling it. But the Church is the only place you will find it. You can find it in the Franciscans and the Missionaries of the Poor. But do not misunderstand me, I am not trying to destroy the ideals of Christianity or to say that they are not achievable. I believe in ideals and the Church possesses them in their fullness--in both the beauty of creative art and architecture (modeling the creativity of the Creator--even though you say it has no use) and in poverty. But each person is called to embrace them to certain degrees (as we see in Scripture). The laity is called to express this devotion in a different way than those taking holy orders and living the religious life. Although all are called to seek the Kingdom first and be willing to give up all at anytime for the sake of the kingdom.\n \n \nfrom Crisis Magazine\n 6.\"If the Church truly followed Jesus, they'd sell their lavish \n art, property, and architecture, and give the money to the poor.\"\n \n When some people think of Vatican City, what they immediately \n picture is something like a wealthy kingdom, complete with palatial \n living accommodations for the pope and chests of gold tucked away in \n every corner, not to mention the fabulous collection of priceless art \n and artifacts. Looking at it that way, it's easy to see how some \n people would become indignant at what they think is an ostentatious \n and wasteful show of wealth.\n \n But the truth is something quite different. While the main buildings \n are called the \"Vatican Palace,\" it wasn't built to be the lavish \n living quarters of the pope. In fact, the residential part of the \n Vatican is relatively small. The greater portion of the Vatican is \n given over to purposes of art and science, administration of the \n Church's official business, and management of the Palace in general. \n Quite a number of Church and administrative officials live in the \n Vatican with the pope, making it more like the Church's main \n headquarters.\n \n As for the impressive art collection, truly one of the finest in the \n world, the Vatican views it as \"an irreplaceable treasure,\" but not \n in monetary terms. The pope doesn't \"own\" these works of art and \n couldn't sell them if he wanted to; they're merely in the care of the \n Holy See. The art doesn't even provide the Church with wealth; \n actually, it's just the opposite. The Holy See invests quite a bit of \n its resources into the upkeep of the collection.\n \n The truth of the matter is that the See has a fairly tight financial \n budget. So why keep the art? It goes back to a belief in the Church's \n mission (one of many) as a civilizing force in the world. Just like \n the medieval monks who carefully transcribed ancient texts so they \n would be available to future generations -- texts that otherwise \n would have been lost forever -- the Church continues to care for the \n arts so they will not be forgotten over time. In today's culture of \n death where the term \"civilization\" can only be used loosely, the \n Church's civilizing mission is as important today as it ever was.\n\n \n \nAnd you think that \"all these things\" that will be added are riches? Million dollar paintings of Jesus? You take Jesus' words out of context. Read verses 31 and 32. They tell you that he is not talking about riches, he is talking about sustenance. \n \n Mt 6:31: Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? 32: (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.\n \n If you are going to bother to quote Jesus, have the respect to quote him in context. \n \n You can try all that you want, but you cannot deny that Jesus said, \"...go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.\" \n \n No, I do not believe all the things added will be riches. I do not believe in the health and wealth gospel per say. But I do believe it could be riches-riches for a purpose to serve the Kingdom.\n \n My quote is not as legitimate as your quote? I can quote him all I want and you can do likewise. But you are lacking a 2000 year context of Holy Tradition and Teaching of the Church. You are making things up as you go with no respect for Christian history. \n \n I ask you again, have you sold all and given it to the poor to follow Jesus? If not, then why are you demanding it of the Church?\n \n \nAgain, as a Christian, it is the words of Jesus that are of the greatest import to me. Paul never met, saw or heard Jesus. You should also note that in the epistles of Paul that are undisputedly written by him (1 Thessalonians, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Romans, Philippians, Philemon) on only one occasion does he appeal to the authority of Jesus to support a moral teaching which the gospels also represent Jesus as having delivered. Only once in all those words.\n\n I'm not sure what your point is about Paul and his one appeal to Jesus to support a moral teaching. Perhaps you could elaborate. Paul said without equivocation that he was going to live and proclaim one thing: Christ and him crucified! (1 Corinthians 2:2, Galatians 2:20  (from your list of undisputed texts)) Paul was accepted as an apostle by the apostles.\n \n If the words of Jesus are all that is important to you then how do you know Jesus at all? Jesus wrote no direct record of his words. All of the words of Jesus that you know were penned by someone else.  \n \n You have to trust someone. Who do you trust? Do you throw away the words of those who walked with Jesus?\n \n \nWhoever wrote the Gospel of John can say what he wants. It is fair to say that he never met Jesus either and was not witness to the events he writes about.\n\n Yes, and you can continue to pick and choose the words of Scripture with no attention to the history of Christianity. Piece together your \"Christian\" puzzle.\n \n I would debate the authorship of the Gospel of John but it seems that EZ has already done this. \n \n \nIf Jesus is God, was he too embarrassed to say, I am God, kneel down and worship me?\n\n I must ask you again what you thought about event of the Transfiguration in Matthew 17. What could that event mean in your opinon?\n \n I believe that Jesus proclaimed his Godhood. And it caused scandal enough that he was crucified and almost stoned. But he didn't have to say it, it can be known from some of the actions of those around him. They did kneel down and worship him:\n \n Matthew 2:11\n Matthew 14:33  showing that the one named Son of God was one to be worshiped\n Matthew 28:9\n Matthew 28:17\n John 9:38\n John 20:28  Thomas my lord, my god\n \n Why did Jesus accept worship? Why did he accept Thomas calling him God without correcting him?\n \n I am experiencing D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. I had this same debate a long time ago with someone named Hank. Have you come back Hank?\n \n Peace.",

There are few christian denominations that teach them.\n \n Mt 5: 43: Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. 44: But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; 45: That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.\n \n Most christian denominations teach \"justifiable war\". I challange anyone to find words of Jesus that justify harming another human being, let alone justifying war. \n \n Do you think the participation of the United States (and other allied powers)in World War II was justified? As Chesterton wrote, \"a good war is sometimes better than a bad peace.\" Sometimes war is necessary when all other avenues of defense have failed. Do you disagree?\n \n Do you see Jesus' actions in the temple--overthrowing the tables and throwing merchants out--as a \"violent\" act in any way? Was his \"violence\" justified?\n \n What is your interpretation of Jesus' words \"Do not think I have come to bring peace on earth; I have not come to bring peace but a sword...?\" (Matthew 10:34)",

The inference that \"Let us make man in our image\" (Genesis 1:26) refers to the plurality of God is refuted by the subsequent verse, which relates the creation of man to a singular God, \"And God created man in His image\" (Genesis 1:27). In this verse the Hebrew verb \"created\" appears in the singular form. If \"let us make man\" indicates a numerical plurality, it would be followed in the next verse by, \"And they created man in their image.\" Obviously, the plural form is used in the same way as in the divine appellation 'Elohim, to indicate the all- inclusiveness of God's attributes of authority and power, the plurality of majesty. It is customary for one in authority to speak of himself as if he were a plurality. Hence, Absalom said to Ahithophel, \"Give your counsel what we shall do\" (2 Samuel 16:20). The context shows that he was seeking advice for himself' yet he refers to himself as \"we\" (see also Ezra 4:16-19).\n \n",

   "Many people have trouble understanding a Triune Being. Humans seem to need a reference point. We define something by what it \"looks or seems\" like. Studying the aquisition of language and psychology of learning bears this out. Scripture says that creation bears witness that there is a Creator, and I believe nature reflects the mysteries of God. Below is my personal conception of triunity. First, I will present what I see from a Scriptural standpoint. Then, I will relate it to physical creation in nature. \n \n Father = Eternal Source and Font of All Being. \n Christ = Eternally generated (Greek-monogenesis) from the Father.\n Spirit = Eternal procession (Greek-ekporefsis) from the Father, and eternal sending(Greek-ekpempsis) through Christ. \n \n In creation our sun is like the Father Source. The rays of the sun are generated to earth in visible form like Christ, the light of the world. Unseen energy represents the Spirit proceeding from sun/Father, sent to earth through the rays/Christ, and can be felt as life-giving energy.\n \n All three (sun/rays/energy) exist simultaneously, at no time apart from the other. All three can be distinguished individually, yet are of the same essense. \n \n In their attempt to defend the Oneness of God, Modalists use the water/ice/vapor approach, only being able to see one of the Divine Persons being manifested at any given time. I disagree, but respect their earnest desire to defend monotheism. \n \n I see Triunity proclaimed Scripturally in both the Old and New Testaments. In the O.T., it was the three angels who visited Abraham, and in the N.T., it was the three Persons bearing witness at the Baptism of Jesus. \n \n Instead of Trinitarian, I think we maybe should use the term Triunitarian. \n \n Thanks for reading. \n \n D.B. emoticon_cool",

   "Howard, \n \n The Eastern Orthodox would say God is Being beyond Being. To ask questions about God is to only run into more questions. I am beginning to think that what we don't know about God defines Him better than what we do know. As Apostle Paul would say, \"In Him we live and move and have our being.\" Therefore, He is our existence, and source of our ontological concept of self in relation to \"other\". Creature realizes its creation, and recognizes a creator must \"be\". I believe our finite minds can only conceive of God to the degree that we experience Him within the created universe. Therefore, from the persepctive of temporal time and space, He is our beginning and end, alpha and omega. I do not believe we can know for sure what lies beyond the consumation of the aions/ages, and the telos/end. All that we are told by Paul is that God will then be \"all in all\". Perhaps that is the best description of who God is. He is our all-in-all. \n \n P.S. Triunity is based on a hypostatic union of the Divine Persons. Therefore, I see God as essentially \"relationship\". Since the concept of relationship is built into the human race, and mankind is the image of God, I think it must point back to His characteristic as such. God is the Great Relationship. \n \n Just my non-dogmatic, philosophical, personal opinion. \n \n D.B. emoticon_cool",

   "Maximus:\n \n I have read back as best I can and here are my thoughts:\n \n First, I quoted Matthew 6:5\n \n Mt 6:5: And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. 6: But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.\n \n You asked:\n\n \n So you do pray in a closet then????????\n \n You hold the Christian position? \n Without question.\n \n \nYou are a Christian who has divorced himself from the 2000 year history of Christianity? \n No, only to those aspects that are not supported by the words and teachings of Jesus Christ.\n \n \nYou are a Christian who has divorced himself from the major portion of traditional Christian scriptural interpretation? \n Whatever scriptural interpretations are not supported by the words and teachings of Jesus Christ or worse, are in conflict with those teachings, I have no problem divorcing myself from. Are Lutherans not \"Christians\" to you because they \"divorced\" themselves from the \"major portion of traditional Christain scriptural interpretation\" at the time?\n \n \nYou are a Christian who has divorced himself from the Apostolic Church founded by Jesus Christ himself? \n Are you talking about the Catholic Church here? Or the Baptist? Or the Lutheran? Or maybe the Church of Christian Science or the Jehovah's Witnesses? Which Church exists today in you opinion is the \"one founded by Jesus Christ himself\"?\n \n \nYou are a Christian who worships alone disconnected from the Body of Christ who is the community of believers? You use the term very loosely.\nI use the term as one who does his best to live by the words and teachings of Jesus Christ, not like the hypocrites who use the term and then extol their members to engage in activities and live their lives in ways that are in opposition to those teachings.\n \n \nAre you to be so narrow minded as to think that prayer did not accompany religious teaching and healing of the sick? \n Please show me where Jesus engaged in such public prayer.\n \n \nYou are showing yourself to be a literalist worthy of the Fundamentalists-someone you seem to distance yourself from but yet hold a lot in common with. Public prayer to show off in vanity is wrong (as Jesus said), sincere public prayer is perfectly okay. \n You can believe whatever you wish about prayer and public prayer, however, your position is not a Christian one. Jesus did not make that distinction. He was very clear in Matthew 6:5.\n \n \nWhat do you think the Jews did when they gathered? \n I do not in any way criticize any other religion for their beliefs and practices, other than to say that they are not Christian. Jews pray in public, Muslims face Mecca, Buddhist vocalize their mantras, I as a Christian, pray in accordance with the teachings of Jesus Christ. Do I think that his teachings are closer to truth than the others? Without question.\n \n \nDo you think before or after someone taught on scripture about God that they might have prayed? What about scripture being taught in public in the first place? Jesus was not afraid of proclaiming God in public, nor were his disciples. \n There is a difference (that I am sure you are aware of) between teaching and praying. Please show me where Jesus leads anyone in public prayer.\n \n \nSilent, solitary prayer is great. But there is nothing wrong with communal, public prayer either.\nAs I said, please believe what you will, it is simply not Christian.\n \n \nIt is true what you say about Jesus \"going away\" to pray in the Garden. But my point is that he went off to pray with a group of men. \n That is not accurate. He did not \"pray with a group of men\", he separated himself from his disciples: \n \n Mark 14:39: And again he went away, and prayed,\n Luke 22:41: And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,\n \n \nWhy did he bring the disciples with him to the garden? \n Nowhere does it say that he brought them to pray. In fact they came with him, I am not sure that he \"brought\" them.\n \n \nWhy was he not in his room or closet to pray? How far did Jesus go away??? \n How far can you throw a stone?\n \n \nWhy did he take James and John with him part of the way? \n Note that it was \"part of the way\" even by your understanding. If you believe that Jesus was fully human, then you know the answer to these questions.\n \n \nCould those present see him? Could they hear him? In Matthew 26:41 why did he tell them to watch and pray while he went off? Weren't all of these men in a group together? It says nothing about them separating.\nIt also does not say that they prayed together.\n \n \nFurthermore, Jesus sang a hymn with the apostles before leaving for the Garden after the Last Supper (Matthew 26:30). What do you think that hymn was about? What is a hymn? Is it a prayer?\nDoesn't say it was, does it. \n \n \nA few other questions come up in regard to open, public prayer:\n \n Why did Jesus tell people to gather in his name? Matthew 18:20 \"For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I in the midst of them.\"\nHe not say to pray in his name.\n \n \nWhat did Jesus mean when he said, \"Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.\" Matthew 5:16\nExactly what he says is what he meant. He does not say to pray and let them see that you are praying to me or to the father.\n \n\n Have you ever heard of the Beatitudes? Jesus announced them in the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 5:3-11. Are blessings prayers?\nNo, they are teachings. He did not say \"I bless the poor in spirit\", he said, \"blessed [past tense] are the poor in spirit.\" The Greek word \"makarios\", translated here a blessed also means happy or content and was actually an ancient Greek reference to the state of gods. It also connotes \"honored\" or \"those who have received gifts or wealth\". So, in short, no it is not a prayer.\n \n In Matthew 26:26 Jesus blessed the bread. Again, what is a blessing but a prayer? Is a prayer before meals in public violating Jesus' commands?\n \n Jesus did not pray to or over the bread, he blessed it. The Greek word used here and translated as \"blessed\" is \"eulogeo\" which means to commend or praise, not pray. Note how two different words with two different meanings are translated into English as if they were the same word with the same meaning. This and a plethora of similar translation issues have caused many ministers to err in their Biblical teachings.\n \n \nIn Matthew 19:13 Jesus laid hands on children and PRAYED for them. Was this a public prayer?\nHere are the passages from Matthew:\n \n Matthew 19:13: Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them. 14: But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven. 15: And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.\n \n Please show me where it says that Jesus prayed with them. In fact the disciples \"rebuked\" them. Was that because the disciples knew that prayer was meant to be in private?\n \n \nIf we were to be isolated in our prayer then why did Jesus teach us to pray Our Father instead of My Father? Since the Our Father is a \"prayer\" taken right out of scripture then is it prayer or teaching of scripture when it is recited?\nBy what dint of reason can you use Matthew 6:9 to support public prayer when three verses prior to that Jesus makes it clear that you are to pray in private. Here are the verses:\n \n Matthew 6:5: And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.\n 6: But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.\n 7: But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.\n 8: Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have \n need of, before ye ask him.\n 9: After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.\n \n \nDid Jesus condemn all public prayer of Jews or just that of the Pharisees that was vain and hypocritical? (Luke 1:10, Luke 2:37 , I doubt he would condemn Zechariah, his uncle, the father of John the Baptist, or the widow)\nYou don't know what Jesus would have said or done, we only know that in Luke 1:10 he wasn't there and Luke 2:37 he was a newborn. \n \n \nIf prayer was only to be in isolation as instructed by Jesus then why did his inner circle meet to \"break bread\" commemorating the Lord's Supper in the book of Acts? \n Breaking bread is not praying as Jesus taught.\n \n \nI find it hard to believe that no prayers would have been said at those gatherings. I find it hard to believe that all of those learning directly from Jesus would have gotten the message wrong.(Acts 20)\nIt really doesn't matter what you or I believe happened or did not happen, what matters is what Jesus taught and he taught his disciples to pray in private. Period.\n \n \nHow clear and simple are they? Do you follow Jesus' teaching to break bread and drink wine in his memory?\n \n Do you have a church to take your issues to if you can't resolve them with your brother? Matthew 18:18\n \n Have you followed Jesus' command to be baptized?\nThis is a typical distraction tactic because you can't find anything that Jesus said or taught to support your positions. I do my best to live in accordance with the words and teachings of Jesus. All of them.\n \n \nThe church cannot be narrowed into extremes as you wish it to be. The Church is universal. It is all things to all men. \n You are free to believe whatever you want about whatever you want. A Christian church should, in my opinion, exist in accordance with the words teachings of Jesus. If you find that \"narrowed to extremes\" feel free to establish whatever church you will, just don't be deceptive and claim it to be Christian.\n \n \nYou don't understand that there are many paradoxes of Christianity and no contradictions of Christianity. Both the beautiful and expansive riches of the Church and her men and women taking vows of poverty are signs of the Kingdom of Heaven. They are an image, a sacrament, a symbol, pointing to something higher than itself. The richness of some of the cathedrals for example is due to more than show. It is due to praise of God and to be a sign pointing us to God. That is why they are massive-they have verticality pointing us to heaven, iconography telling us the story of salvation, and permanence--they are made of the best materials that will last just as long as the Kingdom of Heaven--eternally. They point us to the banquet, majesty, and joy of heaven. At the same time the poverty of the Franciscans, the Poor Clares, the Missionaries of the Poor, and Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity show us the good of giving up earthly things for a higher yearning of something supernatural and outside of earth. Where can you find this sacrifice in any other church outside of the Catholic Church? Both are right. Both are true. \n This romanticized view of the Catholic Church is fodder for another thread if you like but too dense a subject to combine with this exchange of ideas about the teachings of Jesus with regard to prayer and other things.\n \n \nARE YOU LIVING IN POVERTY? HAVE YOU GIVEN UP ALL TO LIVE A CHRISTIAN LIFE? DO YOU HAVE A COMPUTER TO TYPE ON? YOU ARE THE ONE WITH THE CHRISTIAN POSITIONS CORRECT? I AM THE ONE PROPOSING THE NON-CHRISTIAN POSITIONS CORRECT? Do you uphold the same standard that you require of the Catholic Church or do you propose this simply to discredit the Church? Do you own a car? A house? More than one set of clothing? Do you have a job to work for meals? Or does the Lord provide all for you? \n Whether I struggle with Jesus' teaching is not the issue here, but I can clearly state that I have not reached perfection. Jesus extolled us to \"sell our earthly possessions and give the money to the poor.\" He also told us not to worry about where our next meal would come from or our clothes. Do I struggle to sell all I have and follow him? Without question. Does that mean that I don't aspire to do that? No, it means I pray every day that God's will be done and not mine.\n \n As far as what the Catholic Church does with its vast wealth, that is fodder for that other thread as well.\n \n \nYou likely cannot find this ideal of poverty for the kingdom in yourself although you condemn the Church for not fulfilling it. \n If I condemned any church or person for \"not fulfilling\" some teaching of Jesus (which I do not believe I did), I misspoke. I simply say that any Christian church needs to teach what Jesus preached about selling your earthly possessions and extol its members to aspire to that as well as set an example for its members by doing its best to live up to that teaching. That is all I said.\n \n \nBut the Church is the only place you will find it. You can find it in the Franciscans and the Missionaries of the Poor. But do not misunderstand me, I am not trying to destroy the ideals of Christianity or to say that they are not achievable. I believe in ideals and the Church possesses them in their fullness--in both the beauty of creative art and architecture (modeling the creativity of the Creator--even though you say it has no use) and in poverty. But each person is called to embrace them to certain degrees (as we see in Scripture). The laity is called to express this devotion in a different way than those taking holy orders and living the religious life. Although all are called to seek the Kingdom first and be willing to give up all at anytime for the sake of the kingdom.\nThis too is fodder for another thread. As is your cut and paste from Crisis Magazine (which by the way is laughably inaccurate).\n \n \nNo, I do not believe all the things added will be riches. I do not believe in the health and wealth gospel per say. But I do believe it could be riches-riches for a purpose to serve the Kingdom.\nI accept your clarification; however can you reconcile this new position with Jesus explanation that \"The Kingdom of God is within you\" (Luke 17) \n \n \nMy quote is not as legitimate as your quote? I can quote him all I want and you can do likewise. But you are lacking a 2000 year context of Holy Tradition and Teaching of the Church. You are making things up as you go with no respect for Christian history. \n I am not making things up; I am simply using the words and teachings of Jesus Christ as the foundation.\n \n I know I have not covered all of your points as yet, however, out of courtesy I am posting that which I have covered.\n \n All the best.",

   "EZ:\n \n Sorry it has taken so long to get back to you.\n \n As far as Polycarp (bishop or elder of Smyrna) and Irenaeus (Bishop of Lyons), there are serious questions as to their ability to confirm John the disciple as the author of the Gospel of John. As best as can be discerned, Polycarp was born about 70 CE and died in 167 CE at the latest (most scholars believe that he died around 156 CE). Irenaeus claims that Polycarp knew the Apostle. The problem is that there is nothing in Polycarp's letters or any other writings about him that indicate that Polycarp knew the apostle John or even met Irenaeus. The only one who says that Irenaeus met Polycarp and heard this information about the authenticity of the Gospel of John is Irenaeus. At issue for Irenaeus (and later Eusebius) was the idea that there was a direct chain of orthodoxy that extended from the apostle's to his own [Irenaeus'] time. A bigger problem is that in his writings, Polycarp seems to have some knowledge of the Gospel of Matthew and hints at Luke, but does not seem to know the Gospel of John and makes no reference to Irenaeus. (See P.N. Harrison's Polycarp's Two Epistles to the Philippians).\n \n Though Irenaeus makes this claim, all evidence considered, it cannot be substantiated and even Irenaeus himself could not substantiate it.",

   "It's curious that nobody has mentioned the fact that the idea of a trinity of gods was commonplace in ancient times. All pagan religions from the time of Babylon adopted a triad of gods in one form or another. In Babylon, it was Nimrod, Semiramus, and Tammuz; the ancient Egyptians worshipped Osiris, Isis, and Horus in the form of a trinity; in Greece, Zeus, Athena, and Apollo had the same status; the Romans identified Jupiter, Mercury, and Venus as a triad; the Hindu religion to this day has the trinity of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva.\nThese aren't trinities in the Christian sense by a long way. The giveaway is that you say 'A trinity of gods' rather than 'A trinity of God'.\n \n The triad form is very unclear, and some of these I've never heard of: sources?\n \n As for Hinduism: it varies from atheistic, impersonal pantheistic, personal pantheistic, personal transcendent. The existence of true polytheism in Hinduism, at least at a scholarly level, is up for debate. In any case the three are not a trinity: they are either three expressions of one being (usually identified as the world-spirit Brahman, Vishnu or Shiva) or three entirely seperate gods.",

   "Howard,\n Thanks for responding.\n \nFirst, I quoted Matthew 6:5\n \n Mt 6:5: And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. 6: But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.\n \n Without question.\n\n Without question you pray in a closet or private room? Never out in nature? You never say a prayer over a meal or join with family and friends to pray for a loved one who may be sick or in a situation of despair?\n \nNo, only to those aspects that are not supported by the words and teachings of Jesus Christ.\n \n Whatever scriptural interpretations are not supported by the words and teachings of Jesus Christ or worse, are in conflict with those teachings, I have no problem divorcing myself from. Are Lutherans not \"Christians\" to you because they \"divorced\" themselves from the \"major portion of traditional Christain scriptural interpretation\" at the time?\n\n How do you know all of the words and teachings of Jesus? John 21:25  \"But there are also many other things which Jesus did; were very one of them to be written, I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.\"\n \n 2 Thessalonians 2:15  \"So then, brethren, stand firm and hold to the traditions which you were taught by us, either by word of mouth   or by letter.\" \n \n How do you take scripture as accurate only when the authors are writing \"words of Jesus\" yet diminish their veracity when they write other things surrounding, supporting, or expounding those words? How do you make the distinction of what is legitimate and trustworthy and what is not? Whom is your authority and why is your authority correct among 33,000 denominations of Christianity?\n \n We are having a conflict over the teachings of Jesus. How will we decide who is right? Matthew 18:18 \n \n Lutherans are Christians because they profess belief in the Trinity and in a divine Jesus, which is the traditional standard for being a Christian throughout 2,000 years of history. The Lutherans profess the Nicene Creed just as Catholics although their separation from Catholicism was wrong and they have many errors. Modern day Lutherans have also forgotten the beliefs of their founder who started as a Catholic priest. (Plus, I would be in trouble if I believed Lutherans weren't Christians--my wife is Lutheran).\n \nAre you talking about the Catholic Church here? Or the Baptist? Or the Lutheran? Or maybe the Church of Christian Science or the Jehovah's Witnesses? Which Church exists today in you opinion is the \"one founded by Jesus Christ himself\"?\n\n It is crystal clear that I am talking about the Catholic Church. The Baptist, the Lutheran, Church of Christian Science, and Jehovah's witnesses can be easily distinguished from the Catholic Church. None of them are apostolic! None of them are united as one  in doctrine and faith as the Catholic Church is. The Catholic Church can trace its bishops in an unbroken line back to the apostles-those who walked with Jesus! There are four marks of the true church: one, holy, catholic, and apostolic.\n \nI use the term as one who does his best to live by the words and teachings of Jesus Christ, not like the hypocrites who use the term and then extol their members to engage in activities and live their lives in ways that are in opposition to those teachings.\n\n You sound authentic and sincere in your devotion to Christ and your desire to be sanctified and grow in holiness. I commend you for that and encourage you to continue to seek him. But you have erred in throwing out the authority of the one, true Church that Jesus himself established. You have erred in throwing out valid Christian Tradition that has persevered through the ages. False teachings abound and you have been led astray somehow or somewhere.\n \nPlease show me where Jesus engaged in such public prayer.\n\n I forgot to include perhaps one of the most important examples of Jesus praying in public in my previous post. \n \n Do you believe Jesus' words on the cross right before he died were a public prayer? \n \n \"Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.\" Luke 23:34  \n \n \"Father into thy hands I commit my spirit!\" Luke 22:46-(with a loud voice)\n \n \"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?\" Mark 15:34-(again in a loud voice). \n \n Is calling to God a prayer? Is calling to God in a loud voice nailed to a crucifix above a crowd of onlookers a violation of private prayer?\n \nThere is a difference (that I am sure you are aware of) between teaching and praying. Please show me where Jesus leads anyone in public prayer.\n\n Was Jesus' teaching of the Our Father only a teaching of a prayer or a prayer in itself? If Jesus always engaged in private prayer then would this voicing aloud of the Our Father with the specific purpose of conveying it to others be a violation of what he had just said about going into one's closet?\n \n Do you pray the Our Father?\n \nThat is not accurate. He did not \"pray with a group of men\", he separated himself from his disciples: \n \n Mark 14:39: And again he went away, and prayed,\n Luke 22:41: And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,\n \n Nowhere does it say that he brought them to pray. In fact they came with him, I am not sure that he \"brought\" them.\n\n I acknowledged that he did indeed separate from them. But why did he bring them in the first place if praying was something to be done alone in private? And he did bring them. He asked them to stay and watch with him (Matthew 26:38)\n \nHow far can you throw a stone?\n\n Yes, Luke 22:41. How far is a stone's throw? Is it the maximum distance one can throw or how he would casually skip a stone across a lake, or how he would stone a sinner? Did he go far enough away that they couldn't have heard him? IF NO ONE COULD HEAR HIM THEN HOW ARE THE WORDS OF HIS PRAYER RECORDED BY THE AUTHOR? Do you believe those words are truly Jesus' words as you most often rely only on the \"words\" and \"teachings\" of Jesus himself.\n \n But even if the apostles could not hear him, could they see him at a stone's throw? He knelt down (Luke 22:41). The apostles could therefore see him praying could they not? Does this not violate your strict standard of private prayer?\n \nNote that it was \"part of the way\" even by your understanding. If you believe that Jesus was fully human, then you know the answer to these questions.\n\n Did Jesus go a stone's throw from Peter, James and John that he took part of the way or from the full group of disciples? :) \n \nIt also does not say that they prayed together.\n\n In Matthew 26:41, Jesus told those he left behind to pray. It does not say that they prayed together but it is a valid assumption because it also does not say that they separated. They were in a group and he told them to pray. Furthermore, if you look at Luke 22:46, he told them to rise and pray while he was standing in front of them with no indication that he was going away again.\n \nDoesn't say it was, does it.\n\n What is your definition of a hymn? Are you honestly telling me that you don't think a hymn is a prayer? What is the purpose of a hymn then? It was common for Jews to sing the psalms. Have you ever heard a hymn in a church? Jesus and the apostles sang a hymn together.\n \nHe not say to pray in his name.\n\n Do you gather in his name even if you do not pray when you gather? Why not? What would they be doing when gathered do you think? What does it mean to gather \"in the name of Jesus?\" Again so very literal you are and at the same time detesting the fundamentalists. There must be a balance and the Church is the only entity that has maintained that balance throughout the ages. It calms extremes and extinguishes error. That's why the fads of the day and the heresies of yesterday fade yet the Church remains strong and everlasting, pushing through time with the truth.\n \nNo, they are teachings. He did not say \"I bless the poor in spirit\", he said, \"blessed [past tense] are the poor in spirit.\" The Greek word \"makarios\", translated here a blessed also means happy or content and was actually an ancient Greek reference to the state of gods. It also connotes \"honored\" or \"those who have received gifts or wealth\". So, in short, no it is not a prayer.\n \n Jesus did not pray to or over the bread, he blessed it. The Greek word used here and translated as \"blessed\" is \"eulogeo\" which means to commend or praise, not pray. Note how two different words with two different meanings are translated into English as if they were the same word with the same meaning. This and a plethora of similar translation issues have caused many ministers to err in their Biblical teachings.\n\n What about the Beatitudes as written in Luke 6? It seems he is, in fact, blessing people. In Luke 24:50  Jesus raises his hands and blesses the disciples. Prayer in the presence of others??\n \n You are really stretching things throughout these responses and really minimalizing the significance of other things. He commended or praised the bread??? Sounds like idolatry. What does it mean to praise? We praise God-that is prayer. Jesus was giving thanks (Luke 22:19) and praise to God for the gift of the bread.\n \nHere are the passages from Matthew:\n \n Matthew 19:13: Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them. 14: But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven. 15: And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.\n \n Please show me where it says that Jesus prayed with them. In fact the disciples \"rebuked\" them. Was that because the disciples knew that prayer was meant to be in private?\nNo. Do you believe in your heart these shaky defenses you are proposing? Now may be a time for conversion for you as we all go through little conversions throughout our lives. You acknowledged that you hadn't made it to the fullness of your faith. Perhaps this debate will be a stepping stone in that. I also continue to look for the stepping stones along the pathway of faith. \n \n The disciples rebuked them before  Jesus laid hands on them and prayed for them. Jesus summoned them to him, \"Let them come to me,\" \"do not hinder them.\" Then he prayed for them and laid hands on them.\n \nBy what dint of reason can you use Matthew 6:9 to support public prayer when three verses prior to that Jesus makes it clear that you are to pray in private. Here are the verses:\n \n Matthew 6:5: And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.\n 6: But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.\n 7: But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.\n 8: Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have \n need of, before ye ask him.\n 9: After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.\n\n Reason that tells me not everything Jesus said was to be taken literally word for word. Reason that tells me public prayer makes sense in relation to all that we know about the history of Christianity. Reason that tells me that Christianity is not a religion of one but of the Body of Christ-many joined as one. Reason that tells me Christianity is solitude and peace in the inner workings of the spirit but at the same time union and camaraderie with others because the spirit is embodied in flesh.\n \nYou don't know what Jesus would have said or done, we only know that in Luke 1:10 he wasn't there and Luke 2:37 he was a newborn. \n \n What do you think Jesus would have done?? What do you truly believe he would have done to an uncle and a widow who were not praying out of vanity? Jesus gave us common sense.\n \nBreaking bread is not praying as Jesus taught.\n\n I beg to differ. Jesus told us at the last supper to \"Do this in memory of me.\" Table fellowship was very important and this table fellowship was of utmost import because it was a commemoration of Jesus' death on the cross, his gift of eternal life to us, and his communion with us after he ascended. It was the commemoration of the New Covenant that is an everlasting covenant and it is to be commemmorated eternally until it is fulfilled in the second coming.\n \nIt really doesn't matter what you or I believe happened or did not happen, what matters is what Jesus taught and he taught his disciples to pray in private. Period.\n\n You insert the period. Not many others in Christianity have. I don't believe that Jesus did due to the abundance of examples I have shown you here.\n \n \nThis is a typical distraction tactic because you can't find anything that Jesus said or taught to support your positions. I do my best to live in accordance with the words and teachings of Jesus. All of them.\n\n No, it is not distraction. It is an attempt to understand how you follow some of Jesus' commands to the strictest letter of the law and totally forget about others. It is an attempt to understand how in the world you can figure out when the authors of scripture were trustworthy and when they weren't. I'm just trying to understand your methods. Because as it appears to me now, you are very manic in your study and faithfulness. Scripture, it seems, is your worst enemy and your best friend at the same time.\n \n I ask you again, if the words of Jesus are all that is important to you then how do you know Jesus at all? Jesus wrote no direct record of his words. All of the words of Jesus that you know were penned by someone else. \n \n You have to trust someone. Who do you trust? Do you throw away the words of those who walked with Jesus?\n \nYou are free to believe whatever you want about whatever you want. A Christian church should, in my opinion, exist in accordance with the words teachings of Jesus. If you find that \"narrowed to extremes\" feel free to establish whatever church you will, just don't be deceptive and claim it to be Christian.\n\n I have not made any attempt to be deceptive. I assure you of that. Every heresy is an attempt to narrow the Church as G.K. Chesterton writes. I am attempting to show you a broader view of the universal church Jesus created.\n \nThis romanticized view of the Catholic Church is fodder for another thread if you like but too dense a subject to combine with this exchange of ideas about the teachings of Jesus with regard to prayer and other things.\n\n The grand thing about Christianity is its romantic view of things. We are eternal optimists it seems and rightly so. We have eternal life to look forward to. And I find it right to view the Church Jesus started with romance. Its much better than looking on His Holy Church with cynicism and suspicion. \n \nWhether I struggle with Jesus' teaching is not the issue here, but I can clearly state that I have not reached perfection. Jesus extolled us to \"sell our earthly possessions and give the money to the poor.\" He also told us not to worry about where our next meal would come from or our clothes. Do I struggle to sell all I have and follow him? Without question. Does that mean that I don't aspire to do that? No, it means I pray every day that God's will be done and not mine.\n \n As far as what the Catholic Church does with its vast wealth, that is fodder for that other thread as well.\n\n So you can struggle every day with selling all to follow Jesus but yet you disparage the one Church in the world that possesses in full that sign of the Kingdom? You will not find this sign in any other place (except the Orthodox Church which was united in the beginning as one). You will not find priests and nuns renouncing all worldly endeavors and materials in any other place. This is a proof of a link to Jesus' Church just as the apostolic connection I discussed earlier is. \n \n You only have to aspire to sell all but the Church can be ridiculed for not selling all? Seek first the Kingdom that is what you need to do. If you can give up all at a moment's notice for God or to help neighbor then you are okay. If you have no addictions, no gluttonous desires, no overdependence on the material treasures of this world then you are okay. If you are evangelizing then you are okay. Again, both the majesty of the Church's architecture, paintings, jewelry, precious metals, etc. and the charity of her vows of poverty are signs of the Kingdom. Neither should be abandoned.\n \nIf I condemned any church or person for \"not fulfilling\" some teaching of Jesus (which I do not believe I did), I misspoke. I simply say that any Christian church needs to teach what Jesus preached about selling your earthly possessions and extol its members to aspire to that as well as set an example for its members by doing its best to live up to that teaching. That is all I said.\n\n The Catholic Church teaches that. Take it from one who has a very close association. So I guess you will have no need in the future to bring this up again.\n \nThis too is fodder for another thread. As is your cut and paste from Crisis Magazine (which by the way is laughably inaccurate).\n\n Fodder for another thread, perhaps. But proof that the Church obeys Jesus in the most profound way. Proof of a link with Jesus. Truth that you should contemplate.\n \n \nI accept your clarification; however can you reconcile this new position with Jesus explanation that \"The Kingdom of God is within you\" (Luke 17) \n \n That is easily reconciled. Jesus was Incarnated. He put on flesh. He had a body. He lived in the world as human. Since we have spirit and bodies then we are in a physical world in which we have to act with free will-both must be in accord with what is right and good. So the Kingdom is within and without where we make it. As we are all too familiar with the Beatitudes I mentioned (and many other places in scripture), Jesus calls us to action...not simply to an inward contemplation or prayer. \"Let your light shine.\" But all of our motives must be heart-felt and pure. That's why he condemned the Jewish clerics of the time. They were hypocrites. That's why he said looking on a woman with lust is as bad as committing adultery. So the kingdom must be true within as well as without. \n \nI am not making things up; I am simply using the words and teachings of Jesus Christ as the foundation.\n\n You are using your version of the words and teachings of Jesus. I can find 33,000 versions of that. But who was granted true authority to maintain the revelation Jesus gave us? His Church. It is the only logical prevention that Jesus could have provided to prevent the insane splintering of his truth into so many divisive parts. He wanted unity, as he prayed for in John 17.\n \nI know I have not covered all of your points as yet, however, out of courtesy I am posting that which I have covered.\n\n Sorry. I didn't see this last line before I re-posted my questions on the Transfiguration and the worship of Jesus.\n \n Peace be with you.",

   "(From a previous poster):\n \n Silent, solitary prayer is great. But there is nothing wrong with communal, public prayer either. \n \n Can Howard Beale answer these questions?\n \n In Matthew 26:41 why did he tell them to watch and pray while he went off? Weren't all of these men in a group together? \"Public prayer,\" is it not?\n \n Furthermore, Jesus sang a hymn with the apostles before leaving for the Garden after the Last Supper (Matthew 26:30). What do you think that hymn was about? What is a hymn? Is it a prayer?\n \n A few other questions come up in regard to open, public prayer: \n \n In Matthew 26:26 Jesus blessed the bread. Again, what is a blessing but a prayer? Is a prayer before meals in public violating Jesus' commands?\n \n **** In Matthew 19:13 Jesus laid hands on the children and PRAYED for them. Was this a public prayer?\n \n If we were to be isolated in our prayer then why did Jesus teach us to pray Our Father instead of My Father? Since the Our Father is a \"prayer\" taken right out of scripture then is it prayer or teaching of scripture when it is recited?\n \n Did Jesus condemn all public prayer of Jews or just that of the Pharisees that was vain and hypocritical? (Luke 1:10, Luke 2:37 , I doubt he would condemn Zechariah, his uncle, the father of John the Baptist, or the widow)\n \n If prayer was only to be in isolation as instructed by Jesus then why did his inner circle meet to \"break bread\" commemorating the Lord's Supper in the book of Acts? I find it hard to believe that no prayers would have been said at those gatherings. I find it hard to believe that all of those learning directly from Jesus would have gotten the message wrong.(Acts 20)",

   "Maximus:\n \n Fist off, thank you for your detailed and serious replies. They are deeply appreciated. I put your thoughts in the quotes boxes.\n \n \nWithout question you pray in a closet or private room? Never out in nature? You never say a prayer over a meal or join with family and friends to pray for a loved one who may be sick or in a situation of despair?\nJesus spoke in parable and allegory, figurative language to make clear his teachings. He was very clear in Matthew about his opposition to public prayer. He was also very clear when he said \"pray in your closet\". The Greek word tameion translated here as \"closet\" also means \"private room\" or \"secret place\". Notice that he uses the term \"your secret place\", not \"a secret place\" or \"the secret place\". Combine that with the fact that we never hear Jesus lead a group in public prayer and his position seems pretty clear.\n \n You seem to disagree with me that Jesus voiced opposition to public prayer in Matthew 6. Is that correct? Do you think that despite his teachings in Matthew 6, Jesus implied that he supported public praying?\n \n Until someone can show me verses where Jesus contradicts what he says in Matthew: \n \n Mt 6:1: Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven. 2: Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. 3: But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth: 4: That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly. 5: And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. 6: But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.\n \n Until that verse where Jesus contradicts himself is shown to me, I will abide by his teaching here. I also bring to your attention that he speaks of giving alms in private at the same time he teaches of praying in private. He uses the same terms. Do you not think he is clear?\n \n You then go into a long harangue which I am (out of respect) going to respond to, but in truth see as old fashioned shucking and jiving.\n \n \nHow do you know all of the words and teachings of Jesus? John 21:25 \"But there are also many other things which Jesus did; were very one of them to be written, I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.\"\nIt is silly to believe that the words recorded in the four Gospels are the only words that Jesus said. There is fascinating scholarly work ongoing as I write within the Catholic Church as well as by other major theological institutions and by many historical scholars regarding the \"Q\" manuscript, the Gospel of Thomas and other subjects that address this very question. I do not claim to know all that Jesus taught, but I do know what we have of his words in these four Gospels.\n \n It seems that you have a problem with my position on this. I have no problem divorcing myself from whatever scriptural interpretations are not supported by the words and teachings of Jesus Christ or worse, are in conflict with those teachings. It seems that you take issue with divorcing yourself from such teachings and interpretations. Is that correct?\n \n \n2 Thessalonians 2:15 \"So then, brethren, stand firm and hold to the traditions which you were taught by us, either by word of mouth or by letter.\"\nPaul can say whatever he wants. I am a Christian, not a Paulist. Note that Paul says to \"hold to the traditions which you were taught by us\". Well, sorry Paul, I hold to that which was taught by Jesus and Paul never met Jesus or heard him, he relied on hearsay and written accounts.\n \n \nHow do you take scripture as accurate only when the authors are writing \"words of Jesus\" yet diminish their veracity when they write other things surrounding, supporting, or expounding those words? How do you make the distinction of what is legitimate and trustworthy and what is not?\nBy using the brain God gave me and juxtaposing what the Gospel writer has written with the words of Jesus from all the Gospels.\n \n \nWhom is your authority and why is your authority correct among 33,000 denominations of Christianity?\n33,000 denominations are not infallible and neither are you or I. I do not \"correct\" them, I question their veracity. Who is my authority for questioning? Jesus Christ.\n \n \nWe are having a conflict over the teachings of Jesus. How will we decide who is right? Matthew 18:18 \n Mt 18:18: Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.You do not clarify the issue we have with this. If you look at the Greek and then see it in the context of Luke 17:21, Matthew 6:9, and Matthew 10:7, I think you will get a clearer understanding of the basis for my position.\n \n \nLutherans are Christians because they profess belief in the Trinity and in a divine Jesus, which is the traditional standard for being a Christian throughout 2,000 years of history. The Lutherans profess the Nicene Creed just as Catholics although their separation from Catholicism was wrong and they have many errors. Modern day Lutherans have also forgotten the beliefs of their founder who started as a Catholic priest.\nHere you enter a realm that will require another thread. You bring up Church (I will use that term meaning Catholic Church from now on) doctrine. Jesus never spoke of a \"trinity\" or \"three persons in one God\" (triune God) and never said anything that supports some other Church doctrines. You then make the statement that Christians often mistakenly make which is that these doctrines (and other doctrines, practices and traditions) are, \"the traditional standard for being a Christian throughout 2,000 years of history.\" That is simply not true. There is a lot of evidence (much more than supports your statement) that for most of the first century after the death of Jesus there were a number of Christians who did not accept the Paulist doctrines. There is a tremendous amount of scholarly writing on the subject. If you are seriously interested I can give you a number of references, but let us not waste our time if your mind is closed to the possibility that Jesus message has often been misrepresented.\n \n (Plus, I would be in trouble if I believed Lutherans weren't Christians--my wife is Lutheran).\n \n I understand you position and recognize that sometimes \"discretion is the better part of valour.\" \n \n \nIt is crystal clear that I am talking about the Catholic Church. The Baptist, the Lutheran, Church of Christian Science, and Jehovah's witnesses can be easily distinguished from the Catholic Church. None of them are apostolic! None of them are united as one in doctrine and faith as the Catholic Church is. The Catholic Church can trace its bishops in an unbroken line back to the apostles-those who walked with Jesus! There are four marks of the true church: one, holy, catholic, and apostolic.\nThat is simply unsubstantiated Church rhetoric. Again, if you would like independent theological and historical information on the subject, I can make it available to you.\n \n \nYou sound authentic and sincere in your devotion to Christ and your desire to be sanctified and grow in holiness. I commend you for that and encourage you to continue to seek him. \n I appreciate that and encourage you to do the same.\n \n \nBut you have erred in throwing out the authority of the one, true Church that Jesus himself established. You have erred in throwing out valid Christian Tradition that has persevered through the ages. False teachings abound and you have been led astray somehow or somewhere.\nIt seems you put more faith in a man-made institution than in the teachings of Jesus. I suggest (with the greatest respect and good will) that you take the Gospel of Matthew and pull out of it only the words of Jesus and see if you do not get a different picture than the one painted by these man-made institutions. I suggest that you note in particular the only \"commandments\" Jesus extolled as \"his commandments\".\n \n \nI forgot to include perhaps one of the most important examples of Jesus praying in public in my previous post. \n \n Do you believe Jesus' words on the cross right before he died were a public prayer? \n No. \n \n \n\"Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.\" Luke 23:34 \n This in no way reflects Jesus teaching on prayer.\n \n \n\"Father into thy hands I commit my spirit!\" Luke 22:46-(with a loud voice)\nNeither does this. Jesus is simply expressing the fact that he is dying. Again, check the Greek.\n \n \n\"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?\" Mark 15:34-(again in a loud voice). \n This is not a prayer as Jesus taught us to pray - I think even you would agree with that.\n \n \nIs calling to God a prayer? Is calling to God in a loud voice nailed to a crucifix above a crowd of onlookers a violation of private prayer?\nNo, it is not. \n \n In general response, refer back to Matthew 6 for Jesus teachings on prayer.\n \n \nWas Jesus' teaching of the Our Father only a teaching of a prayer or a prayer in itself? \n It is pretty obvious that that was what he was doing. Matthew 6:6-9 is Jesus telling the disciples what not to do and what to do. That is instructing someone how to do something. Like saying, \"When you start the car, don't push too hard on the gas, keep the gear in park, turn the key...\" The teacher is not starting the car, he is explaining to the student how it is done. Matthew 6:6-9 is very much like that. The following verses explain to them the essence of prayer - and brilliantly so.\n \n \nIf Jesus always engaged in private prayer then would this voicing aloud of the Our Father with the specific purpose of conveying it to others be a violation of what he had just said about going into one's closet?\nYou're grasping at straws here. You are a smart guy; you know the difference between teaching and praying. Read Matthew 6 with a clear and open mind and you cannot help but conclude that Jesus is teaching.\n \n \nDo you pray the Our Father?\nEvery moment of every day. Do you?\n \n \nI acknowledged that he did indeed separate from them. \n So you agree that Jesus' actions are in line with his teachings - at least in this instance.\n \n \nBut why did he bring them in the first place if praying was something to be done alone in private? And he did bring them. He asked them to stay and watch with him (Matthew 26:38)\nWe can speculate on the answers to this and a lot of other questions. If you knew that you were going to be arrested wouldn't you want the support of your friends? Would you ask them to key an eye out when you went off by yourself to pray? That is one plausible explanation - but in truth it is as much speculation as any other answer.\n \n Speculating as to exactly what happened and why Jesus did what he did is for me a tangential endeavor. There are too many little variations in the four Gospels to take the position that they are each exact descriptions of events. However, even though there are also minor discrepancies in the exact words Jesus used to teach and explain things, the substance and meaning of his words is readily discernable. Understanding what he told us is, for me, the main thing.\n \n \nLuke 22:41. How far is a stone's throw? \n I guess it depends on the thrower.\n \n \nIs it the maximum distance one can throw or how he would casually skip a stone across a lake, or how he would stone a sinner? \n You seem more interested in examining the minutia of the Gospel writer's turn of phrase than in examining the words of Jesus. Why is that?\n \n \nDid he go far enough away that they couldn't have heard him? IF NO ONE COULD HEAR HIM THEN HOW ARE THE WORDS OF HIS PRAYER RECORDED BY THE AUTHOR? Do you believe those words are truly Jesus' words as you most often rely only on the \"words\" and \"teachings\" of Jesus himself.\nI have no idea how they learned the content of Jesus' prayer (Luke 22:42). Perhaps Jesus told them why he needed to pray. Perhaps one of them sneaked up close to listen - or moved close to protect Jesus. Fact is we don't know and again we enter the realm of speculation. At minimum we know that Jesus did not lead them in a group public prayer. We know that the Gospels never show him doing that. We know that he taught the disciples to pray in private. We know that he rejected public prayer in Matthew 6. Other things we can speculate on, but not to the point where that speculation blinds us to what we know.\n \n \nBut even if the apostles could not hear him, could they see him at a stone's throw? \n Again, tangential issues: How far is \"a stone's throw\"? \"Could they see him?\" \"Could they hear him\"? Don't let them blind us to what we know.\n \n \nHe knelt down (Luke 22:41). The apostles could therefore see him praying could they not? Does this not violate your strict standard of private prayer?\nThis modified sarcastic approach and subtle distortion is beneath you. You know that it is not my \"strict standard\". I am simply putting in front of us what Jesus said and taught. It is not me speaking in Matthew 6. If you don't like the teaching, take it up with the guy who taught it, Jesus, not me.\n \n \nDid Jesus go a stone's throw from Peter, James and John that he took part of the way or from the full group of disciples?\nI don't know. Do you? Is it possible that the writers of the gospels weren't exactly the Shakespeares of their time? That they might have a limited vocabulary and be weak in journalistic skills? Is it possible that Luke had no idea whether Jesus was 2 meters or 20 meters away and that he used the term \"stone's cast\" to just give a general idea?\n \n \nIn Matthew 26:41, Jesus told those he left behind to pray. It does not say that they prayed together but it is a valid assumption because it also does not say that they separated. \n Assume what you will. You still have Matthew 6 to deal with and Jesus does not say \"pray together\" in Matthew 26. In fact you see no place in any Gospel where Jesus says that.\n \n \nThey were in a group and he told them to pray. Furthermore, if you look at Luke 22:46, he told them to rise and pray while he was standing in front of them with no indication that he was going away again.\nYour need to prove your preconceptions and defend the interpretation of others leads you to deceptive statements. Read Luke 22:46 and then Luke 22:47. Something happens while Jesus is talking that changes everything. \n \n Luke 22:46: And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. 47: And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him.\n \n The fact that you do not acknowledge that in your question - if fact you try and slip this by -- indicates that either your scholarship is weak or that you are purposefully being deceptive.\n \n I am not interested in winning a debate; I am interested in seeing more clearly. What is you interest?\n \n \nWhat is your definition of a hymn? Are you honestly telling me that you don't think a hymn is a prayer? What is the purpose of a hymn then? It was common for Jews to sing the psalms. Have you ever heard a hymn in a church? Jesus and the apostles sang a hymn together.\nIs your position that despite what he taught in Matthew 6 Jesus engaged in public prayer? That is what your position would have to be if you define a hymn as a prayer. To me a hymn is a hymn and a prayer is a prayer as the term prayer is used by Jesus. Is the Battle Hymn of the Republic a prayer?\n \n \nDo you gather in his name even if you do not pray when you gather? Why not? What would they be doing when gathered do you think? What does it mean to gather \"in the name of Jesus?\" \n Are you saying that what Jesus really meant was that the disciples should gather and pray to him? Despite Matthew 6? \n \n Why doesn't Jesus come right out and say that. He was pretty clear in Matthew 6. I believe he said what he meant and meant what he said. Why is he not as clear and direct about what you claim he meant?\n \n \nAgain so very literal you are and at the same time detesting the fundamentalists.\nI'd appreciate it if you did not put words in my mouth. I do not \"detest\" anyone. If I did or do, I am off the mark.\n \n \nThere must be a balance and the Church is the only entity that has maintained that balance throughout the ages. \n Completely subjective, unsubstantiated Church propaganda.\n \n \nIt calms extremes and extinguishes error. \n This too is subjective, unsubstantiated Church propaganda.\n \n I will not address it here - it will require another thread which I am not interested in. However, I do suggest you read up on your church history. I also suggest that you focus on the first century after Christ. In addition, as you go along in time, the Middle Ages and Renaissance need special attention as well -- see how many errors the Church extinguished and how many extremes it calmed.\n \n \nWhat about the Beatitudes as written in Luke 6? It seems he is, in fact, blessing people. In Luke 24:50 Jesus raises his hands and blesses the disciples. Prayer in the presence of others??\nYou completely ignored the information I presented. Check the Greek. Check the tense. Check the meaning of the words. Use the brain God gave you. It is a subtle mistranslation and/or misinterpretation of the original Greek -- perhaps because the translator referred to the Latin. Jesus was not praying, he was informing, teaching, explaining to the people the highest truth and meaning of material manifestation. He was saying \"You are blessed\", not \"I bless you\".\n \n \nYou are really stretching things throughout these responses and really minimalizing the significance of other things. He commended or praised the bread??? Sounds like idolatry. \n Try as you might, you are still stuck with Matthew 6. The Greek word used throughout the gospels for \"pray\" (and is the root for the term prayer) is the word \"proseuchomai\" the word translated as \"bless\" in Luke 24:50 is the Greek word \"eulogeo\" and in Luke 6 the word translated as blessed is the Greek word \"makarios\". My position has been stated and the scholarly research that supports it is readily available. Use any Biblical website. Check Strong's Lexicon. Better yet, check an academic reference that is not interested in the religions need but simply interested in the meaning of the words. If you cannot find any references and you are seriously interested, I can supply other for you.\n \n \nWhat does it mean to praise? We praise God-that is prayer. Jesus was giving thanks (Luke 22:19) and praise to God for the gift of the bread.\nYou have Matthew 6 to deal with as well as the Greek original renditions. Do you see a difference between what Jesus says in Luke 22 and Matthew 6? I do not see them as contradictory.\n \n \nThat's why the fads of the day and the heresies of yesterday fade yet the Church remains strong and everlasting, pushing through time with the truth.\nThe same can be said for Islam. In fact Judaism can claim an longer history. So what?\n \n \nDo you believe in your heart these shaky defenses you are proposing? \n I don't see the words of Jesus as \"shaky defenses\". You may not like them and that is fine.\n \n \nNow may be a time for conversion for you as we all go through little conversions throughout our lives. \n I am always open to \"conversion\". In fact it is a process of growth I strive for daily. Are you open to conversion as well?\n \n \nYou acknowledged that you hadn't made it to the fullness of your faith. \n Without question. I acknowledge that there are some teachings of Jesus that I have not fully grasped (I believe I was talking about his extolling us to sell all our earthly possessions and give the money to the poor and follow him specifically.\n \n Are you claiming to have made it to the fullness of your faith?\n \n \nPerhaps this debate will be a stepping stone in that. I also continue to look for the stepping stones along the pathway of faith. \n Wherever 2 or more are gathered...\n \n It seems that you are interested in defending the Church and I am interested in living by the teachings of Jesus. Does that appear accurate to you?\n \n \nThe disciples rebuked them before Jesus laid hands on them and prayed for them. Jesus summoned them to him, \"Let them come to me,\" \"do not hinder them.\" Then he prayed for them and laid hands on them.\nMatthew 19:13: Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them. 14: But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven. 15: And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.\n \n First, nowhere did I say that the disciples rebuked them after Jesus told them not to. In fact I quoted the verses that say differently. \n \n More importantly, I don't mind that you misrepresent what I wrote and imply that I wrote something different - but now you do the same with the words of Jesus and that is offensive. You have gone from \"tweaking\" Jesus words, to quoting what he said out of context, to misquoting him, to now putting words in his mouth. Please show me the verse in Matthew 19:13-15 where Jesus prayed. That is what you claim. I quote you: \"Then he prayed for them and laid hands on them.\" Show me where it says that.\n \n Did you know that it does not say that? Are you so blinded by your dogma that the truth is not visible to you?\n \n \nReason that tells me not everything Jesus said was to be taken literally word for word. \n That is true of everything written in the Bible. However, one man's reasoning is another man's chaos, so reason can be deceptive at times. Nonetheless, although it is more understanding than reason, and though we may come at it from different angles, we agree. I have stated over and over that Jesus spoke in parables and allegory - figurative language - like any good teacher - to make his teachings understood.\n \n \nReason that tells me public prayer makes sense in relation to all that we know about the history of Christianity. \n Reason may tell you that, but Jesus didn't. That is all I am saying.\n \n \nReason that tells me that Christianity is not a religion of one but of the Body of Christ-many joined as one.\nPerhaps you should listen less to your reasoning and more to the words of Jesus. Tossing around a bunch of terms drenched in dogma is meaningless.\n \n \nReason that tells me Christianity is solitude and peace in the inner workings of the spirit but at the same time union and camaraderie with others because the spirit is embodied in flesh.\nThat's nice - and it is Christian as long as it follows the teachings of Jesus.\n \n Referring to Luke 1:10 and 2:37 you ask:\n \nWhat do you think Jesus would have done?? What do you truly believe he would have done to an uncle and a widow who were not praying out of vanity? Jesus gave us common sense.\nI think he would have kept silent in the moment and then when the opportunity arose he would teach them about prayer and \"Our Father\". \n \n \nI beg to differ. Jesus told us at the last supper to \"Do this in memory of me.\" \n Do you include in your concept of \"prayer\" the act of doing something in someone's memory? I can accept that as a form of human prayer in the broadest sense of the English word. It is not what Jesus considered prayer, however. I can see that saying that commemorating, thanking, contemplating, meditating, etc. are forms of prayer to you. But when someone is on their deathbed and says, \"Raise a glass to me on my birthday\", I do not consider that they are asking me to pray - but I can see feeling that way.\n \n \nTable fellowship was very important and this table fellowship was of utmost import because it was a commemoration of Jesus' death on the cross, his gift of eternal life to us, and his communion with us after he ascended. It was the commemoration of the New Covenant that is an everlasting covenant and it is to be commemmorated eternally until it is fulfilled in the second coming.\nI don't disagree, but Jesus had a different idea of prayer and he expressed it clearly in Matthew 6 - and public prayer was not something he supported.\n \n \nQuote: Howard Beale\n It really doesn't matter what you or I believe happened or did not happen, what matters is what Jesus taught and he taught his disciples to pray in private. Period. \n You insert the period. Not many others in Christianity have. I don't believe that Jesus did due to the abundance of examples I have shown you here.\nI have to admit that I am not clear on what you mean here.\n \n \nNo, it is not distraction. It is an attempt to understand how you follow some of Jesus' commands to the strictest letter of the law and totally forget about others.\nPlease inform me of \"Jesus' commands\" that I have forgotten. Being human, I am sure that it is possible.\n \n \nIt is an attempt to understand how in the world you can figure out when the authors of scripture were trustworthy and when they weren't. I'm just trying to understand your methods. \n I originally went into a long-winded outline of my Biblical study. Suffice it to say that I have 16 years of Biblical training and know Biblical Greek and Hebrew. I have devoted a great part of my life to Bible study and understanding the message of Moses and the teachings of Jesus because they were and are vitally important to me. I apply my intellect to what I have read, learned and discussed. I engage in discussion with others about it. For the past few years I have been using the web to try and understand how the teachings of Jesus have been so distorted and why, despite all that Jesus said, people refuse to accept his teachings and continue to believe they are Christians.\n \n \nBecause as it appears to me now, you are very manic in your study and faithfulness. Scripture, it seems, is your worst enemy and your best friend at the same time.\nDistortion is an adversary; the words of Jesus are friends. Personal attack is beneath you.\n \n \nI ask you again, if the words of Jesus are all that is important to you then how do you know Jesus at all? Jesus wrote no direct record of his words. All of the words of Jesus that you know were penned by someone else. \n \n You have to trust someone. Who do you trust? Do you throw away the words of those who walked with Jesus?\nI use the teachings of Jesus sort of like a backdrop - like when a photographer wants to take a picture of a white object, he won't use a white backdrop because then his object will not be discernable. Jesus is like a pure white backdrop I hold up the Gospel writers' words, the teachings of various religious groups, the Epistles and other dogma against the backdrop of the words of Jesus. Where there is any discrepancy I fall back on the words of Jesus.\n \n \nI have not made any attempt to be deceptive. I assure you of that. Every heresy is an attempt to narrow the Church as G.K. Chesterton writes. I am attempting to show you a broader view of the universal church Jesus created.\nChesterton is a prime example of someone whose words should be held up to those of Jesus - especially his ideas on war. Jesus is Jesus. Chesterton is Chesterton. Whatever your \"broader views\" may be, I use the same criteria to assess them.\n \n \nThe grand thing about Christianity is its romantic view of things. We are eternal optimists it seems and rightly so. We have eternal life to look forward to. And I find it right to view the Church Jesus started with romance. Its much better than looking on His Holy Church with cynicism and suspicion.\nTry looking at things through the lens of the teachings of Jesus - the lens of truth. It is neither optimistic nor pessimistic, romantic nor cynical. It is the clearest lens I have encountered. Through the lens of Jesus I have come to see clearly the God of Moses and the God of Abraham. Jesus pointed the way, religions have chosen to worship the pointer rather than follow the path he pointed out.\n \n \nSo you can struggle every day with selling all to follow Jesus but yet you disparage the one Church in the world that possesses in full that sign of the Kingdom? \n I do not disparage, I simply point out that Jesus taught something other than that which the Church may be teaching on a given subject. No man or institution is infallible - an issue you chose not to address, by the way.\n \n \nYou will not find this sign in any other place (except the Orthodox Church which was united in the beginning as one). You will not find priests and nuns renouncing all worldly endeavors and materials in any other place. This is a proof of a link to Jesus' Church just as the apostolic connection I discussed earlier is.\nI asked you if you have been to the Vatican, to the retreats of the Pope and Cardinals in Italy, France and other places. You never responded. \n \n \nYou only have to aspire to sell all but the Church can be ridiculed for not selling all? \n Again, I am not ridiculing, I am simply pointing out an area of the teachings of Jesus where the Church has fallen flat. There are other areas as well and some have been abominable.\n \n \nSeek first the Kingdom that is what you need to do. \n Right on! We all do. But remember what Jesus said: \"Behold, the Kingdom of God is within you.\"\n \n \nIf you can give up all at a moment's notice for God or to help neighbor then you are okay. If you have no addictions, no gluttonous desires, no overdependence on the material treasures of this world then you are okay. If you are evangelizing then you are okay. Again, both the majesty of the Church's architecture, paintings, jewelry, precious metals, etc. and the charity of her vows of poverty are signs of the Kingdom. Neither should be abandoned.\nThat is your opinion and that is good. It is not in line with anything that Jesus (or Moses for that matter) extolled or taught.\n \n \nQuote: Howard Beale\n If I condemned any church or person for \"not fulfilling\" some teaching of Jesus (which I do not believe I did), I misspoke. I simply say that any Christian church needs to teach what Jesus preached about selling your earthly possessions and extol its members to aspire to that as well as set an example for its members by doing its best to live up to that teaching. That is all I said. \n The Catholic Church teaches that. Take it from one who has a very close association. So I guess you will have no need in the future to bring this up again.\nJust because you say it is so does not make it so. What you are saying flies in the face of historic reality and my own personal experience. Wouldn't the Church have been better off giving the millions it has paid to settling lawsuits to the poor centuries ago?\n \n I will respect your request to not discuss this subject further, but encourage you to do some independent research on it.\n \n \nQuote: Howard Beale\n This too is fodder for another thread. As is your cut and paste from Crisis Magazine (which by the way is laughably inaccurate). \n Fodder for another thread, perhaps. But proof that the Church obeys Jesus in the most profound way. Proof of a link with Jesus. Truth that you should contemplate.\nYour concept of \"proof\" is very subjective. The fact is that we do not know and cannot prove any of it. You chose to believe it, that is fine, but belief is not\"proof\".\n \n \nYou are using your version of the words and teachings of Jesus. \n Please show me where I am misquoting Jesus - or using \"my version of his words and teachings\" which implies that what I am saying is not based on his words.\n \n \nI can find 33,000 versions of that. But who was granted true authority to maintain the revelation Jesus gave us? His Church. It is the only logical prevention that Jesus could have provided to prevent the insane splintering of his truth into so many divisive parts. He wanted unity, as he prayed for in John 17.\nThat is again unsubstantiated, Church propaganda and has nothing to do with what Jesus said and taught.\n \n Finally, there are so many areas that we have discussed so far where we are in such deep confusion of each other's positions that I would like to simply focus on the cans or worms we have already opened and see if we find any common ground before opening other cans.\n \n All the best.",

   "The context to me suggests that swearing is seen as inevitably being by something, and the claim is that we have essentially no right to swear on anything as it is God's not ours. Thus 'you cannot make one hair on your head black and white' etc.\nWe are very close to seeing the same meaning in Jesus' words. The difference is that your focus is on the examples (don't swear by heaven don't swear by earth, don't swear by Jerusalem, don't swear by your own hair - which is actually shows a sense of humor, something we are so very reluctant to acknowledge that Jesus may have had.) My focus is on the instruction: \"But I say unto you, Swear not at all;\" Which I hear as, \"Don't promise things because you cannot guarantee the future\" - in the colloquial, \"there are no guarantees in life.\" \n \n When I look at Jesus words in context, in 33 he simply uses the word \"epiorkeo\" which is translated as \"forswear\" in the KJV but as \"make false vows\" in the NAS, the connotation being \"false promises\": A vow to pay a debt is a promise. A vow to buy someone a car is a promise. A vow you make knowing that you can't keep it is a false vow. \n \n Also, the syntax makes the first part of 33 a full and complete thought: \"But I say unto you, Swear not at all;\" You either have to believe that Jesus is saying never take an oath to tell the truth or he is saying never promise things. Another reason this holds together better for me is that you have to reconcile 33-36 with 37: \"But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.\" Don't take an oath and then limit what you say to yes and no because any more than that comes from evil (a phrase which is also a questionable translation)?",

Making an oath by something\n 1) implies ownership of that thing, which is properly God's\n 2) implies that you are only being truthful because of the oath, not for truth's sake.\nTo me Jesus was a teacher of the truth on a spiritual plane. We often confuse this because Moses, though he imparted many stunning spiritual truths, was also a leader on the material plane (a politician, statesman and military leader) and the history of Jewish spiritual teachers prior to Jesus is also a history of material realm leaders as well (Kings, military leaders, politicians, etc.) One of the striking things about Jesus is that he chose not to the leader of a political, military movement or a movement based in the material world (my kingdom is not of this world).\n \n Your contention that (1) Making an oath by something implies ownership of that thing, which properly belongs to God is accurate - whether that \"thing\" is heaven, Jerusalem, or your own head. On a material plane we'd have to admit that our heads belong to us. On the spiritual plane, God is all and all is God's. That includes my head and yours, as well as the future. That is why in another place Jesus tells us not to worry about the future because God will take care of it. So, I guess I am saying that if we focus on the spiritual aspect of the teaching, it then connects with so many other teachings of Jesus and his message becomes clearer and clearer. If we focus on the material aspects of his teachings, the connections become harder to discern.\n \n As far as contention 2 that is a bit more subtle, but I also see the truth of what you contend. That when we swear (or even promise) \"on a thing\" (heaven, city, head), we somehow imbue that thing with a meaning or power that it does not have, a meaning or power that is rightly God's. For me the same is true with regard to the future. Promising something in the future is a silly as swearing on a Bible or a cross. Both things miss the mark.",

   "The Case Against Q\n \n http://www.ntgateway.com/Q/\n \n Fallacies at the Heart of Q\n \n http://www.ntgateway.com/Q/fallacy.htm\n \n 10 Reasons to Question Q\n \n 1. No-one has ever seen Q\n Current literature on Q abounds with editions of Q, investigations into its strata, studies of the communities that were behind it and analyses of their theology. In such circumstances, it is worth allowing ourselves the sober reminder that there is no manuscript of Q in existence. No-one has yet found even a fragment of Q. \n \n 2. No-one had ever heard of Q\n No ancient author appears to have been aware of the existence of Q. One will search in vain for a single reference to it in ancient literature. For a while it was thought that 'the logia' to which Papias referred might be Q. Indeed, this was one of the planks on which the Q hypothesis rested in the nineteenth century. But no reputable scholar now believes this.\n \n 3. Narrative Sequence in Q\n Q apparently has a narrative sequence in which the progress of Jesus' ministry is carefully plotted. In outline this is: John the Baptist's appearance in the Jordan, his preaching, Jesus' baptism, temptations in the wilderness, Nazara, a great Sermon, Capernaum where the Centurion's Boy is healed, messengers from John the Baptist. This narrative is problematic for the Q theory in two ways. First, it contradicts the assertion that Q is a \"Sayings Gospel\" that parallels Thomas. Second, this sequence makes sense when one notices that it corresponds precisely to the places at which Matthew departs from Mark's basic order (in Matt. 3-11) and where Luke, in parallel, departs from that order. In other words, it makes good sense on the assumption that Luke is following Matthew as well as Mark.\n \n 4. Occam's Razor\n The British medieval philosopher Occam suggested a fine working principle: that entities should not be multiplied beyond what is necessary. How then has Q escaped Occam's razor?

No. The only source you have is Irenaeus who used the reference to Polycarp to reinforce his credentials in his crusade to crush the Gnostics.

   "Howard,\n \nJesus spoke in parable and allegory, figurative language to make clear his teachings. He was very clear in Matthew about his opposition to public prayer. He was also very clear when he said \"pray in your closet\". The Greek word tameion translated here as \"closet\" also means \"private room\" or \"secret place\". Notice that he uses the term \"your secret place\", not \"a secret place\" or \"the secret place\". Combine that with the fact that we never hear Jesus lead a group in public prayer and his position seems pretty clear.\n \n You seem to disagree with me that Jesus voiced opposition to public prayer in Matthew 6. Is that correct? Do you think that despite his teachings in Matthew 6, Jesus implied that he supported public praying?\n \n Until someone can show me verses where Jesus contradicts what he says in Matthew: \n \n Mt 6:1: Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven. 2: Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. 3: But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth: 4: That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly. 5: And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. 6: But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.\n \n Until that verse where Jesus contradicts himself is shown to me, I will abide by his teaching here. I also bring to your attention that he speaks of giving alms in private at the same time he teaches of praying in private. He uses the same terms. Do you not think he is clear?\n\n I think I have shown you very clear verses that contradict your interpretation of Jesus' words although none of these verses contradict the true meaning of Jesus' words. Jesus did not contradict himself. His words cannot be contradicted. Many of his words are paradoxical though. There is a significant difference between a paradox and a contradiction. But let me give you further example since you have not perceived this.\n \n Was Matthew 6 possibly a use of hyperbole by Jesus to make a point crystal clear to all those listening? Was his point that good things, including prayer and almsgiving, done among others should be done with pure and true motives? Or was he telling us not to do them at all? \n \n \"Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.\" Matthew 5:16  Is almsgiving a good deed? Is prayer a good work?\n \n For additional examples of Jesus praying among others which I have not quoted until this point:\n \n John Chapter 17 (Read the last paragraph of Chapter 16 also. Jesus prays a very long prayer to the Father in front of the disciples.\n \n John 11:41  Jesus publicly prayed to God in thanksgiving for the raising of Lazarus.\n \n \nIt is silly to believe that the words recorded in the four Gospels are the only words that Jesus said. There is fascinating scholarly work ongoing as I write within the Catholic Church as well as by other major theological institutions and by many historical scholars regarding the \"Q\" manuscript, the Gospel of Thomas and other subjects that address this very question. I do not claim to know all that Jesus taught, but I do know what we have of his words in these four Gospels.\n \n It seems that you have a problem with my position on this. I have no problem divorcing myself from whatever scriptural interpretations are not supported by the words and teachings of Jesus Christ or worse, are in conflict with those teachings. It seems that you take issue with divorcing yourself from such teachings and interpretations. Is that correct?\n\n The teachings of the Church and Christ's teachings are one and the same. The Church is the agent he chose to convey his teachings in the world once he left it. So no, I do not have any difficulty divorcing myself from teachings that are not supported by Jesus' words and teachings. \n \n \nMt 18:18: Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.You do not clarify the issue we have with this. If you look at the Greek and then see it in the context of Luke 17:21, Matthew 6:9, and Matthew 10:7, I think you will get a clearer understanding of the basis for my position.\n\n Sorry I meant Matthew 18:17-\"tell it to the church\" when there is a difference among you. Were those Jesus' words? If so why do you not follow them? If not then why have you singled out these words of Jesus to disobey?\n \n \nI understand you position and recognize that sometimes \"discretion is the better part of valour.\" \n \n I consider Lutherans and other mainstream churches Christian as well as evangelicals. But I do not shrink from making my wife aware of the truth of the Catholic Church in contrast and comparison with the Lutheran Church.\n \n Were they Christians who dismissed Paulist doctrines or were they heretics?\n \n \nQuote: (Maximus)\n It is crystal clear that I am talking about the Catholic Church. The Baptist, the Lutheran, Church of Christian Science, and Jehovah's witnesses can be easily distinguished from the Catholic Church. None of them are apostolic! None of them are united as one in doctrine and faith as the Catholic Church is. The Catholic Church can trace its bishops in an unbroken line back to the apostles-those who walked with Jesus! There are four marks of the true church: one, holy, catholic, and apostolic. \n \n \nThat is simply unsubstantiated Church rhetoric. Again, if you would like independent theological and historical information on the subject, I can make it available to you.\n\n Do you contend that the Catholic Church is not apostolic? If so, I would like the evidence that leads you to believe this.\n \n \nIt seems you put more faith in a man-made institution than in the teachings of Jesus. I suggest (with the greatest respect and good will) that you take the Gospel of Matthew and pull out of it only the words of Jesus and see if you do not get a different picture than the one painted by these man-made institutions. I suggest that you note in particular the only \"commandments\" Jesus extolled as \"his commandments\".\n\n The Catholic Church is not a man-made institution. It is Jesus made.\n \n \nQuote: (Maximus)\n I forgot to include perhaps one of the most important examples of Jesus praying in public in my previous post. \n \n Do you believe Jesus' words on the cross right before he died were a public prayer? \n \n \nNo.\n \n \n \nQuote: (Maximus)\n \"Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.\" Luke 23:34 \n \n \nThis in no way reflects Jesus teaching on prayer.\n\n Why not?\n \nQuote: (Maximus)\n \"Father into thy hands I commit my spirit!\" Luke 22:46-(with a loud voice) \n \n \nNeither does this. Jesus is simply expressing the fact that he is dying. Again, check the Greek.\n\n So, if I commend my spirit to God then that is not a prayer?\n \n \nQuote: (Maximus)\n \"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?\" Mark 15:34-(again in a loud voice). \n \n \nThis is not a prayer as Jesus taught us to pray - I think even you would agree with that.\n\n It is a question of God. I think many of us submit questions to God in prayer. Do you not?\n \n \nQuote: (Maximus)\n Is calling to God a prayer? Is calling to God in a loud voice nailed to a crucifix above a crowd of onlookers a violation of private prayer? \n \n \nNo, it is not. \n \n In general response, refer back to Matthew 6 for Jesus teachings on prayer.\n\n Please give me your definition of prayer with a greater elaboration on Matthew 6. If we stick to Matthew 6 in the literal way in which you contend then the Our Father is the only prayer we should be praying privately or otherwise as Jesus said, \"when you pray, pray like this.\" Give me a fuller meaning of what you engage in when you pray.\n \n \nQuote: (Maximus)\n If Jesus always engaged in private prayer then would this voicing aloud of the Our Father with the specific purpose of conveying it to others be a violation of what he had just said about going into one's closet? \n \n \nYou're grasping at straws here. You are a smart guy; you know the difference between teaching and praying. Read Matthew 6 with a clear and open mind and you cannot help but conclude that Jesus is teaching.\n\n All it will take is one straw to disprove you because you are being so fundamentally literal (and there is a place for that in scriptural interpretation but not here). I have given you many \"straws.\" Choose your favorite.\n \n \nQuote: (Maximus)\n Do you pray the Our Father? \n \n \nEvery moment of every day. Do you?\n\n Are you being evasive? Do you pray the formulaic Our Father prayer that Jesus taught shortly after telling us to pray in a closet? That is how he taught us to pray. I ask you again, do you follow Jesus' words to commemorate the Last Supper in memory of him, have you been baptized?",

   "Howard,\n \nQuote: (Maximus)\n I acknowledged that he did indeed separate from them. \n \n \nSo you agree that Jesus' actions are in line with his teachings - at least in this instance.\n\n Yes. Jesus' actions are always in line with his teachings.\n \n \nQuote: (Maximus)\n But why did he bring them in the first place if praying was something to be done alone in private? And he did bring them. He asked them to stay and watch with him (Matthew 26:38) \n \n \nWe can speculate on the answers to this and a lot of other questions. If you knew that you were going to be arrested wouldn't you want the support of your friends? Would you ask them to key an eye out when you went off by yourself to pray? That is one plausible explanation - but in truth it is as much speculation as any other answer.\n \n Speculating as to exactly what happened and why Jesus did what he did is for me a tangential endeavor. There are too many little variations in the four Gospels to take the position that they are each exact descriptions of events. However, even though there are also minor discrepancies in the exact words Jesus used to teach and explain things, the substance and meaning of his words is readily discernable. Understanding what he told us is, for me, the main thing.\n\n It is not mere speculation when it rests on the foundation of Christian prayer passed down to us by our Christian brothers and sisters that walked with Jesus.\n \n \nI guess it depends on the thrower.\n You seem more interested in examining the minutia of the Gospel writer's turn of phrase than in examining the words of Jesus. Why is that?\n\n I am attempting to show you the minutia with which you are clinging to your interpretation of Jesus' teaching on prayer. :) \n \n \nQuote: (Maximus)\n He knelt down (Luke 22:41). The apostles could therefore see him praying could they not? Does this not violate your strict standard of private prayer? \n \n \nThis modified sarcastic approach and subtle distortion is beneath you. You know that it is not my \"strict standard\". I am simply putting in front of us what Jesus said and taught. It is not me speaking in Matthew 6. If you don't like the teaching, take it up with the guy who taught it, Jesus, not me.\n\n It is your strict standard that was not observed by the earliest of Christians. I ask you again, does the ability of the apostles to see Jesus violate his previous teaching that prayer should be in a closet, a private room, or a secret place? In an open garden, withdrawn from a group of men that we have reason to believe Jesus' wanted to accompany him, where one can be seen does not seem to fit the definition of a closet, a private room, or a secret place. It's not very private and not very secret.\n \n \nQuote: (Maximus)\n In Matthew 26:41, Jesus told those he left behind to pray. It does not say that they prayed together but it is a valid assumption because it also does not say that they separated. \n \n \nAssume what you will. You still have Matthew 6 to deal with and Jesus does not say \"pray together\" in Matthew 26. In fact you see no place in any Gospel where Jesus says that.\n\n And you assume what you will. Because you have a less sure footing in determining how the apostles prayed than do I with the scripture that I have presented and the backing of the Tradition and teaching of the Church. \n \n \nQuote: (Maximus)\n They were in a group and he told them to pray. Furthermore, if you look at Luke 22:46, he told them to rise and pray while he was standing in front of them with no indication that he was going away again. \n \n \nYour need to prove your preconceptions and defend the interpretation of others leads you to deceptive statements. Read Luke 22:46 and then Luke 22:47. Something happens while Jesus is talking that changes everything. \n \n Luke 22:46: And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. 47: And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him.\n \n The fact that you do not acknowledge that in your question - if fact you try and slip this by -- indicates that either your scholarship is weak or that you are purposefully being deceptive.\n \n I am not interested in winning a debate; I am interested in seeing more clearly. What is you interest?\n\n Good point, you may be right there. But looking at it in the context of Mark 14:38 and Mark 14:40  I wonder if they were still together when Jesus returned because they had no intention of breaking up to pray or because they simply fell asleep prior to separating. More speculation on my part.",

   "Howard,\n \nIs your position that despite what he taught in Matthew 6 Jesus engaged in public prayer? That is what your position would have to be if you define a hymn as a prayer. To me a hymn is a hymn and a prayer is a prayer as the term prayer is used by Jesus. Is the Battle Hymn of the Republic a prayer?\n\n Yes, it would seem that the Battle Hymn is a prayer if one reads the lyrics. Glory, Glory, alleluia! My position is that you are misinterpreting what Jesus taught and that he did, in fact, engage in prayer that was not private. A hymn is a prayer and Jesus sung it out in the open with others.\n \n \nAre you saying that what Jesus really meant was that the disciples should gather and pray to him? Despite Matthew 6? \n \n Why doesn't Jesus come right out and say that. He was pretty clear in Matthew 6. I believe he said what he meant and meant what he said. Why is he not as clear and direct about what you claim he meant?\n\n Jesus was not always initially direct in what he said. He used parables to explain things but he often had to explain the parables to the disciples. So why did he speak in parables, why not be direct? Why did he not give the Jews a definitive sign except for the sign of Jonah? I would be speculating again, I guess, to find the answer.\n \n \nYou completely ignored the information I presented. Check the Greek. Check the tense. Check the meaning of the words. Use the brain God gave you. It is a subtle mistranslation and/or misinterpretation of the original Greek -- perhaps because the translator referred to the Latin. Jesus was not praying, he was informing, teaching, explaining to the people the highest truth and meaning of material manifestation. He was saying \"You are blessed\", not \"I bless you\".\n Try as you might, you are still stuck with Matthew 6. The Greek word used throughout the gospels for \"pray\" (and is the root for the term prayer) is the word \"proseuchomai\" the word translated as \"bless\" in Luke 24:50 is the Greek word \"eulogeo\" and in Luke 6 the word translated as blessed is the Greek word \"makarios\". My position has been stated and the scholarly research that supports it is readily available. Use any Biblical website. Check Strong's Lexicon. Better yet, check an academic reference that is not interested in the religions need but simply interested in the meaning of the words. If you cannot find any references and you are seriously interested, I can supply other for you.\n\n I do not know Biblical Greek so I consulted a friend who does. He affirms part of what you say and disagrees with some of what you say. His response is here:\n \nI would agree with him that Jesus was \"teaching\" not praying when he gave us the beatitudes (see Matthew 5:2). However, I would disagree with him about the blessing of the bread. \"Eulogeo\" does not necessarily connote prayer, he is correct about that. However, when it is used with reference to \"blessing\" a meal, it means \"to ask God's blessing.\" That involves prayer! So Jesus was praying when he blessed the bread and cup. We use this language similarly when we say, \"Let's say the blessing.\" Or, \"let us bless these meals.\"\n\n More examples of this are found when Jesus blesses the loaves and fish on the mount: Luke 9:16; Matt 14:19; Mark 6:41; John 6:11\n \n \nThe same can be said for Islam. In fact Judaism can claim an longer history. So what?\n\n Well the comparison between the religions leads me to believe that Christianity is the truth. Why do you follow the teachings of Jesus and not of Mohammed or Judaism? Or do you follow all? The context of my statement is within the realm of Christianity. If you are going to be a Christian then the best bet is with the original-the Catholic Church. All the fads fade away and the Church charges on through the ages protected by the power of Christ.\n \n \nI am always open to \"conversion\". In fact it is a process of growth I strive for daily. Are you open to conversion as well?\n\n Most certainly I am open to conversion. At least we are on the same page here although our approaches differ. I did not mean to condescend in presuming to know when you need a conversion. It is a sincere hope of mine, though, that in this matter you will experience a conversion to the truth. Or I will if I am wrong-a constant prayer of mine when entering into dialogues like this is, \"God, if I do not speak the truth then shut my mouth.\" And I hope that he shuts it in any way he sees fit when I err.\n \n \nWithout question. I acknowledge that there are some teachings of Jesus that I have not fully grasped (I believe I was talking about his extolling us to sell all our earthly possessions and give the money to the poor and follow him specifically.\n \n Are you claiming to have made it to the fullness of your faith?\n\n No. I acknowledged that I am looking for the stepping stones too. I will reach the fullness of faith if I reach heaven and only then.\n \n \nIt seems that you are interested in defending the Church and I am interested in living by the teachings of Jesus. Does that appear accurate to you?\n\n In defending the teachings of the Church I am defending the teachings of Jesus.\n \n \nMatthew 19:13: Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them. 14: But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven. 15: And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.\n \n First, nowhere did I say that the disciples rebuked them after Jesus told them not to. In fact I quoted the verses that say differently. \n \n More importantly, I don't mind that you misrepresent what I wrote and imply that I wrote something different - but now you do the same with the words of Jesus and that is offensive. You have gone from \"tweaking\" Jesus words, to quoting what he said out of context, to misquoting him, to now putting words in his mouth. Please show me the verse in Matthew 19:13-15 where Jesus prayed. That is what you claim. I quote you: \"Then he prayed for them and laid hands on them.\" Show me where it says that.\n \n Did you know that it does not say that? Are you so blinded by your dogma that the truth is not visible to you?\n\n I have done no such things with the words of Jesus or with your own. Perhaps it is a matter of translation. My Bible does order it the way in which I presented it. What translation do you use?\n \n \nThat is true of everything written in the Bible. However, one man's reasoning is another man's chaos, so reason can be deceptive at times. Nonetheless, although it is more understanding than reason, and though we may come at it from different angles, we agree. I have stated over and over that Jesus spoke in parables and allegory - figurative language - like any good teacher - to make his teachings understood.\n\n In your opinion, did Jesus leave us with any mechanism by which we could understand his teachings? Any mechanism by which we could be assured of the truth and wade through the chaos of reason? What is it? Or did he leave us to wonder and wander throughout our lives?\n \n \nQuote: (Maximus)\n Reason that tells me public prayer makes sense in relation to all that we know about the history of Christianity. \n\n \nReason may tell you that, but Jesus didn't. That is all I am saying.\n\n Sure he did. He showed us. See the verses I have supplied. \n \n Reason tells me one thing. It tells you another. Who is right? I ask again, what mechanism did Jesus leave us for determining this? Is Matthew 18:17  relevant?\n \n \nPerhaps you should listen less to your reasoning and more to the words of Jesus. Tossing around a bunch of terms drenched in dogma is meaningless.\n\n On the contrary, dogma is the only thing that does make words meaningful. If you have no dogma as to what a word means then it is meaningless. If you have no dogma as to what God means then he is meaningless. If you have no dogma defining your religion than it is devoid of meaning. Dogma is the essentials. Dogma is the guts. It is the \"meanings.\" If there is no dogma then there is nothing because all will melt into one indifferent, apathetic, indistinguishable, and secular or heretical mishmash.\n \n \nDo you include in your concept of \"prayer\" the act of doing something in someone's memory? I can accept that as a form of human prayer in the broadest sense of the English word. It is not what Jesus considered prayer, however. I can see that saying that commemorating, thanking, contemplating, meditating, etc. are forms of prayer to you. But when someone is on their deathbed and says, \"Raise a glass to me on my birthday\", I do not consider that they are asking me to pray - but I can see feeling that way\n\n Yes, I include doing something in someone's memory part of prayer. In Catholic life we offer masses for those who have gone before us. Not everything done in someone's memory is a prayer. But we must remember who we are remembering in the commemoration of the Last Supper and what we are commemorating. In this context, it is definitely prayer. Any of the Christian martyrs would tell you that, as the mass was often said in their memory and over their graves. To this very day, mass is said on an altar containing a relic of a martyr. The saints have a glass raised to them at each and every mass and especially recently on All Saint's Day (Nov.1st)-that glass is the cup of Jesus' blood poured out for them and all of us-no trifling cocktail in the neighborhood pub.\n \n \nQuote: (Maximus)\n No, it is not distraction. It is an attempt to understand how you follow some of Jesus' commands to the strictest letter of the law and totally forget about others.\n \n \nPlease inform me of \"Jesus' commands\" that I have forgotten. Being human, I am sure that it is possible.\n\n I have recorded this previously in questioning you if you observe baptism, commemorating the Lord's Supper, etc\n \n \n (Maximus) Because as it appears to me now, you are very manic in your study and faithfulness. Scripture, it seems, is your worst enemy and your best friend at the same time. \n \n \nDistortion is an adversary; the words of Jesus are friends. Personal attack is beneath you.\n\n This was not an attack on your person but on your methods.\n \n \nChesterton is a prime example of someone whose words should be held up to those of Jesus - especially his ideas on war. Jesus is Jesus. Chesterton is Chesterton. Whatever your \"broader views\" may be, I use the same criteria to assess them.\n\n Which reminds me. You never answered if you thought the Allied actions in WWII were justifiable. Is a good war better than a bad peace, as Chesterton would ask?\n \n \nI do not disparage, I simply point out that Jesus taught something other than that which the Church may be teaching on a given subject. No man or institution is infallible - an issue you chose not to address, by the way.\n\n As you would say-fodder for another thread-one that's probably already been traversed if we search.\n \n \nI asked you if you have been to the Vatican, to the retreats of the Pope and Cardinals in Italy, France and other places. You never responded. \n \n No. I have not but I have seen pictures. My wife has been twice. Beautiful place.\n \n \nRight on! We all do. But remember what Jesus said: \"Behold, the Kingdom of God is within you.\"\n\n It is within and without. \n \n \nQuote: (maximus)\n If you can give up all at a moment's notice for God or to help neighbor then you are okay. If you have no addictions, no gluttonous desires, no overdependence on the material treasures of this world then you are okay. If you are evangelizing then you are okay. Again, both the majesty of the Church's architecture, paintings, jewelry, precious metals, etc. and the charity of her vows of poverty are signs of the Kingdom. Neither should be abandoned. \n \n \nThat is your opinion and that is good. It is not in line with anything that Jesus (or Moses for that matter) extolled or taught.\n\n When Jesus said that \"You must lose your life in order to find it\" did he mean that we must immediately commit suicide?\n \n \nJust because you say it is so does not make it so. What you are saying flies in the face of historic reality and my own personal experience. Wouldn't the Church have been better off giving the millions it has paid to settling lawsuits to the poor centuries ago?\n \n I will respect your request to not discuss this subject further, but encourage you to do some independent research on it.\n\n Obviously, the Church did not have the millions you mention that it gave in settling lawsuits to give to the poor centuries ago. They take up collections every Sunday. A lot of collections have passed in those centuries. \n \n \nYour concept of \"proof\" is very subjective. The fact is that we do not know and cannot prove any of it. You chose to believe it, that is fine, but belief is not\"proof\".\n\n We cannot prove that there are people currently living under Jesus' mandate to give up all for the kingdom? We cannot prove that clergy have taken a vow of poverty? I think we can. We can see them, touch them, talk to them. Go to a monastery. Can we deny that this is a direct link with him? Not subjective at all. Very concrete and straight forward.\n \n \nQuote: (Maximus)\n I can find 33,000 versions of that. But who was granted true authority to maintain the revelation Jesus gave us? His Church. It is the only logical prevention that Jesus could have provided to prevent the insane splintering of his truth into so many divisive parts. He wanted unity, as he prayed for in John 17. \n\n \nThat is again unsubstantiated, Church propaganda and has nothing to do with what Jesus said and taught.\n\n Unsubstantiated Church propaganda? No. Scripture-John 17-Jesus' teachings plain and simple. He wanted us to be one. Did he give us a mechanism by which to remain united? Yes, his Church built on the rock of Peter.\n \n Any thoughts yet on the Transfiguration and the examples I supplied of Jesus being worshiped?",

   "Ms. Bennet,\n In your opinion, is the Anglican church apostolic? If so, what is the case that it presents for apostolic succession?\n \n The Roman Church did not start as an imperial church. The empire wasn't around for 300 years or so. I think many martyrs of the faith would differ with that assertion. It started at Peter's appointment as the foundation of the Church and was solidified in the upper room after Jesus' resurrection.\n \n Why do you desire to receive communion at a Catholic Church?\n\n \n Mr, thankyou. The Anglican church is apostolic because its archbishops follow in unbroken succession from Augustine, who traces his authority through the early church. The early church was not Roman. I agree that Peter's appintment was the foundation of the church, but the church was not the Roman church until the empire hijacked it. There have always been other Christian groups that are not Roman. I don't place much importance in the doctrine of apostolic succession, I tend toward the protestant interpretation that it is the teaching that is important, not a dubious line of succession.\n \n My desire to receive communion is in accordance with Jesus' commands in the gospels, if the celebrant is Roman Catholic then I will gladly receive from them, similarly if they are methodist, or anglican, or lutheran, or any other denomination that breaks bread and shares the cup in accordance with Christ's command. I believe in one holy, catholic, and apostolic church. I do not believe this is achieved by claiming others are not part of the church, but recognising that what we hold in common is more important, that Jesus is Lord, by his blood we are saved. Catholic does not mean Roman, it means the whole church.",

   "Hi Maximus:\n \n Hope all is well with you.\n \n I just edited this post with this paragraph to apologize because I did not see Parts I and II. My response is only to part III. I will get back to you on all the rest, but first I hope you can read this post and give me your thoughts.\n \n \nYes, it would seem that the Battle Hymn is a prayer if one reads the lyrics. Glory, Glory, alleluia! My position is that you are misinterpreting what Jesus taught and that he did, in fact, engage in prayer that was not private. A hymn is a prayer and Jesus sung it out in the open with others.\nMatt 6:6: But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.\n \n I believe that Jesus was intelligent enough to mean exactly what he said and to say exactly what he meant. It is difficult enough to get to through to what he actually said given the seeming agendas of most of the translators and that he spoke in Aramaic and Hebrew.\n \n \"Pray to thy Father in secret\" is pretty clear. My position is exactly as stated by Jesus, the position you are offering requires \"interpreting\" (or misinterpreting).  \n \n 1. Can you as least acknowledge the veracity if the statement in bold above?\n \n As far as The Battle Hymn of the Republic being a prayer I would simply say it does not fit Jesus criteria for prayer... unless you sing it in the shower perhaps...\n \n \nJesus was not always initially direct in what he said. He used parables to explain things but he often had to explain the parables to the disciples. So why did he speak in parables, why not be direct? Why did he not give the Jews a definitive sign except for the sign of Jonah? I would be speculating again, I guess, to find the answer.\nI agree that Jesus spoke in parables, but he also spoke directly at times and Matthew 6:6 is pretty direct. It is not a parable, that is for sure.\n \n You consulted a friend who has knowledge of Biblical Greek. The friend critiqued what I said as follows:\nI would agree with him that Jesus was \"teaching\" not praying when he gave us the beatitudes (see Matthew 5:2). However, I would disagree with him about the blessing of the bread. \"Eulogeo\" does not necessarily connote prayer, he is correct about that. However, when it is used with reference to \"blessing\" a meal, it means \"to ask God's blessing.\" That involves prayer! So Jesus was praying when he blessed the bread and cup. We use this language similarly when we say, \"Let's say the blessing.\" Or, \"let us bless these meals.\"\nHe agrees with most of what I say but then tweaks things to support a position for public prayer. The translation/interpretation of the Greek word \"eulogeo\" as pray is not a big stretch, but given that Greek Gospels are what we have (and they are the only ones we have) which were transposed from the Aramaic and Hebrew that Jesus spoke, and given the direct statement of Jesus in Matthew 6:6, I choose to believe (and see that belief as clearly supported by the words of Jesus) that Jesus did not contradict himself at all. \"Blessing\" (eulogeo) is not \"praying\" (proseuchomai). If you read the Gospel of Matthew you will always see the term \"proseuchomai\" used as people go off by themselves and the word \"eulogeo\" used in public. They are different words with different meanings and if you acknowledge that and read it clearly, Jesus does not contradict himself at all. We have to step out of the envelope of the institutionally proscribed meanings and look at the true meanings.\n \n \nMore examples of this are found when Jesus blesses the loaves and fish on the mount: Luke 9:16; Matt 14:19; Mark 6:41; John 6:11\nAnd in none of them is the word \"proseuchomai\" used; the word \"eulogeo\" is used. The writer of the Gospels show that Jesus draws the distinction clearly between praying and blessing by using the words in specific contexts. When the word \"proseuchomai\" is used to say that someone prayed, that person is always (by my reading) in a private space. \"proseuchomai\" is never used in reference to public activity. In Matthew alone, see 14:23; 26:36; 26:41; 26:42; 26:44. In Mark 1:35; 6:64; 14:35; 14:39. The same holds through Luke. John never uses \"proseuchomai\" or \"eulogeo\", he uses \"eratao\" which the translators have chosen to translate in the other 3 gospels as ask, desire or entreat (and at times \"pray\" with that connotation), but in John they translate it consistently as \"pray\" when \"ask\" would be a clearer translation given today's meaning of the word in English. \"Pray, pass the peas.\" Or \"I pray your horse wins the race.\" \n \n 2. Will you (and/or your friend) at least grant that the above is accurate and is indicative of something? That my position is not unfounded, but a possible rendering of what Jesus said and meant?\n \n Other than apologizing for any inappropriate language, suspicions or accusations on my part (which I do here), I'd like to get your responses to the two underlined questions before responding to the rest of your thoughts.\n \n Finally, I would like to clarify that I see many Christian organizations doing wonderful and heroic things, and I put the Catholic Church high up there. However, no person or institution is infallible and it is not a condemnation of an institution, or an individual, to question, probe, analyze and critique their beliefs and their basis for them. It is, however, very disconcerting when one confronts people who claim to \"know\" and who distort the words of Jesus. Those distortions need to be addressed.\n \n All the best.",

I do not believe this is achieved by claiming others are not part of the church, but recognising that what we hold in common is more important, that Jesus is Lord, by his blood we are saved. Catholic does not mean Roman, it means the whole church.\n\n Ms. Bennet,\n You are right. The early Church was not roman. It was Jewish and Gentile. But that very same Church became Roman. Its origins are clear. That Church became Roman because its head Peter went to Rome. And another important apostle, Paul, also was there. That the empire allowed the Church to flourish is certain. But it did not mar its protection of the revelation of Jesus or its descent from him.\n \n There are some interesting points that you bring up concerning apostolic succession in the Anglican Church and your belief in the Pope.\n \n You see, you cite Augustine as the link of the Anglican Church with the Apostolic Church but Augustine&#8217;s views were clear. He believed in the primacy of the pope. Anglicans obviously differ from their ancestor on this very important point. From Augustine&#8217;s writings:\n \n \"[T]here are many other things which most properly can keep me in [the Catholic Church&#8217;s] bosom. The unanimity of peoples and nations keeps me here. Her authority, inaugurated in miracles, nourished by hope, augmented by love, and confirmed by her age, keeps me here. The succession of priests, from the very see of the apostle Peter, to whom the Lord, after his resurrection, gave the charge of feeding his sheep [John 21:15&#8211;17], up to the present episcopate, keeps me here. And last, the very name Catholic, which, not without reason, belongs to this Church alone, in the face of so many heretics, so much so that, although all heretics want to be called &#8216;Catholic,&#8217; when a stranger inquires where the Catholic Church meets, none of the heretics would dare to point out his own basilica or house\" (Against the Letter of Mani Called \"The Foundation\" 4:5 [A.D. 397]).\n \n \"[On this matter of the Pelagians] two councils have already been sent to the Apostolic See [the bishop of Rome], and from there rescripts too have come. The matter is at an end; would that the error too might be at an end!\" (Sermons 131:10 [A.D. 411]).\n \n \"If the very order of episcopal succession is to be considered, how much more surely, truly, and safely do we number them [the bishops of Rome] from Peter himself, to whom, as to one representing the whole Church, the Lord said, &#8216;Upon this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not conquer it.&#8217; Peter was succeeded by Linus, Linus by Clement. ... In this order of succession a Donatist bishop is not to be found\" (Letters 53:1:2 [A.D. 412]).\n \n \"Among these [apostles] Peter alone almost everywhere deserved to represent the whole Church. Because of that representation of the Church, which only he bore, he deserved to hear &#8216;I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of heaven&#8217;\" (Sermons 295:2 [A.D. 411]). \n \n \"Some things are said which seem to relate especially to the apostle Peter, and yet are not clear in their meaning unless referred to the Church, which he is acknowledged to have represented in a figure on account of the primacy which he bore among the disciples. Such is &#8216;I will give unto you the keys of the kingdom of heaven,&#8217; and other similar passages. In the same way, Judas represents those Jews who were Christ&#8217;s enemies\" (Commentary on Psalm 108 1 [A.D. 415]). \n \n \"Who is ignorant that the first of the apostles is the most blessed Peter?\" (Commentary on John 56:1 [A.D. 416]).\n \n If the Anglican church gains its apostolic authority from Augustine then one would think logically that they would also put their faith in the authority and succession which Augustine cites for the power and rightfulness of his own authority&#8212;the Chair of Peter via the appointment of Jesus.\n \n In fact, the founder of your Church, Henry the VIII, also believed in the primacy of the pope. Why else would he seek his permission for divorce. So we see what the true church of England, that is, the Catholic Church in England, initially believed about the pope and his authority. It wasn&#8217;t until the King could not get what he wanted that he began to degrade, rebel against, and destroy the original church, the Catholic Church. It was not until then that he began to dilute, distort, and manipulate its teachings. It was not until the teaching of the Church began to conflict with personal lifestyle that he declared it null and void (as so many of us do today). We may see this replayed again with the issue of homosexuality in the Anglican Church. Will there be a split because Christian teaching again conflicts with lifestyle? Who is there to maintain the unity of the Anglicans as the unity of Catholics is maintained by its head, the pope?\n \n I also still wonder why you cite Elizabeth as the origin of the Anglican Church and not Henry VIII or even Edward VI. Is there an attempt to distance the Anglican Church from Henry VIII? Do the clergy still pledge allegiance to the King of England as the head of the Church?\n \n The claim that others are not a part of the Church is truly an effort of uniting all, as Jesus prayed for in John 17. It is an effort to call all back into the original and unified fold of Jesus. But we must all believe what is true, what Jesus revealed and what has been kept in his Church. It is not an effort at exclusion. It is an effort at clarity&#8212;that we may be of one accord in mind, body, spirit, and faith&#8212;as Paul called for (Ephesians 4:3-6, Phil 2:2, Ephesians 4:4). \n \n The Eucharist is the most important element of this &#8220;common union&#8221;&#8212;communion. If we do not believe the same things even about the Real Presence in the Eucharist then we should abstain from making false shows of our union. Paul says that, &#8220;Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body.&#8221; (1 Corinthians 10:17) But now there is not one body because there is not one bread. There is not one belief in the Real Presence of the Eucharist. And Lutherans and Methodists do not fully conform to the Lord&#8217;s command in breaking the bread. For they do not teach the Real Presence that Jesus conveyed to us in John 6 and that Paul confirmed in 1 Corinthians 11:27-31. Do the Anglicans teach the Real Presence? If not, why not? If so, do they then have the priests with the proper Holy Orders and apostolic succession to validly consecrate the Eucharist in conformity with that teaching? All Christian churches contain truth but only one Christian church possesses the fullness of truth&#8212;the Catholic Church.\n \n Lastly, it is true what you say about the word catholic meaning &#8220;whole&#8221; church or &#8220;universal&#8221; church. But the original use of the term prior to the Reformation&#8217;s distorting of it, referred to a specific church:\n \n \"See that you follow the bishop, even as Jesus Christ does the Father, and the presbytery as you would the apostles; and reverence the deacons, as being the institution of God. Let no man do anything connected with the Church without the bishop. Let that be deemed a proper Eucharist, which is either by the bishop, or by one to whom he has entrusted it. Wherever the bishop shall appear, there let the multitude also be; even as, wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church.\" St. Ignatius of Antioch, Epistle to the Smyrneans 8, A.D. 107\n \n peace.",

   "Howard,\n I realize that our discussion has become difficult to manage and long-winded. If you want to focus your reply due to time and organization then these are the main points that I would like to hear your comments on:\n \n 1. John Chapter 17 (Read the last paragraph of Chapter 16 also. Jesus prays a very long prayer to the Father in front of the disciples.\n \n John 11:41 Jesus publicly prayed to God in thanksgiving for the raising of Lazarus.\n \n 2. Thoughts on the significance of the Transfiguration and the examples I supplied of Jesus being worshiped in relation to the divinity of Jesus (which I think you have stated that you doubt).\n \n 3. Do you pray the formulaic Our Father prayer that Jesus taught shortly after telling us to pray in a closet? That is how he taught us to pray. Do you follow Jesus&#8217; words to commemorate the Last Supper in memory of him, and his words instructing us to be baptized?\n \n 4. Did the ability of the apostles to see Jesus violate his previous teaching that prayer should be in a closet, a private room, or a secret place? In an open garden, withdrawn from a group of men that we have reason to believe Jesus&#8217; wanted to accompany him, where one can be seen does not seem to fit the definition of a closet, a private room, or a secret place. It&#8217;s not very private and not very secret.\n \n 5. In your opinion, did Jesus leave us with any mechanism by which we could understand his teachings? Any mechanism by which we could be assured of the truth and wade through the chaos of reason? What is it? Or did he leave us to wonder and wander throughout our lives? To elaborate on this question, is there any mechanism by which a child, a common man, a mentally retarded individual, a blind person might come to know Jesus without 16 years of Bible study and 8 years of theology and philosophy?\n \n (One note of clarification, my friend who knows biblical greek did not include the examples of prayer from Luke 9:16; Matt 14:19; Mark 6:41; John 6:11. I put those in as an addendum to what I said in relation to the Last Supper but I did not mean it to be attached to the specific point about the original greek).\n \n Look forward to hearing your response. I have enjoyed our dialogue thus far. Peace.",

I am not sure as to why. \n \n However, in my last post (#372 on this thread) I posed two questions to you which I feel require a response before I proceed. If we cannot come to some common ground on those two questions, then I doubt that you will be able to (or perhaps willing to) even consider my analysis of larger and more complex issues like Biblical interpretation and Biblical translation, let alone Church doctrine.\n \n As far as every verse you bring up here, I have responded to them in post #372.

This makes clear that faith alone is sufficient for salvation.

Does your paradigm of interpretation fit with other aspects of Jesus&#8217; teaching?\n If he was being clear then why did he then refer to Abraham as father? Luke 16:24, Jesus speaking of the rich man&#8217;s appeal to Abraham, \"Father Abraham, have mercy upon me...&#8221; Why would Jesus quote this man, calling another &#8220;father&#8221; if he had outlawed this practice? \n \n Would you say that Jesus was being clear in Matthew 5: 28-30? Did he mean what he said? \"But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.\"\n \n We agree very clearly on what Jesus said in the statement in Matthew 6. We do not agree on what he meant. What Jesus said here in this specific instance doesn&#8217;t necessarily need interpreting if we read all of scripture as a whole and don&#8217;t take things out of context. That is, we can see simply by looking at other instances of scripture that Jesus did not mean to be strictly literal about this. He was rather attempting to censure the Pharisees for ostentatious prayer. He was using hyperbole. But I grant you that much of scripture does need interpreting&#8212;the Bible can&#8217;t interpret itself. But it needs an interpreting agent with proper authority&#8212;the authority granted by Jesus&#8212;the Church is the only entity that fits this bill. Otherwise, we go into a splintered truth and a chaos of competing interpretations that leads to 33,000 denominations of Christianity.\n \n \nAs far as The Battle Hymn of the Republic being a prayer I would simply say it does not fit Jesus criteria for prayer&#8230; unless you sing it in the shower perhaps&#8230;\n\n Or if you sing it in a public, open garden perhaps&#8230;or if you sing it along with 12 of your closest friends or disciples perhaps&#8230;\n \n \nI agree that Jesus spoke in parables, but he also spoke directly at times and Matthew 6:6 is pretty direct. It is not a parable, that is for sure.\n\n Yes. Jesus speaks directly at times. This is clear in John 6 and his teaching on the Real Presence of the Eucharist. Matthew 6:6 is not one of these instances.\n \n \nYou consulted a friend who has knowledge of Biblical Greek. The friend critiqued what I said as follows:He agrees with most of what I say but then tweaks things to support a position for public prayer.

In Matthew alone, see 14:23; 26:36; 26:41; 26:42; 26:44. In Mark 1:35; 6:64; 14:35; 14:39. The same holds through Luke. John never uses &#8220;proseuchomai&#8221; or &#8220;eulogeo&#8221;, he uses &#8220;eratao&#8221; which the translators have chosen to translate in the other 3 gospels as ask, desire or entreat (and at times &#8220;pray&#8221; with that connotation), but in John they translate it consistently as &#8220;pray&#8221; when &#8220;ask&#8221; would be a clearer translation given today&#8217;s meaning of the word in English. &#8220;Pray, pass the peas.&#8221; Or &#8220;I pray your horse wins the race.&#8221; \n \n 2. Will you (and/or your friend) at least grant that the above is accurate and is indicative of something? That my position is not unfounded, but a possible rendering of what Jesus said and meant?\n\n I showed your response to my friend. He replied thus, &#8220;Proseuchomai is used in the Garden when Jesus prays. Further, I would add that Jesus taught that public prayer is a good thing in Luke 18:10-14 with the story of the Pharisee and the publican. Both went to the temple to pray (proseuchomai is used again). Jesus says the difference was the manner in which they prayed. They both prayed in public&#8230; in the temple. The publican &#8220;went home justified&#8221; because he prayed humbly.&#8221; \n \n My elaboration of my friend&#8217;s reply is thus: If &#8220;proseuchomai&#8221; is used for Jesus&#8217; prayer in the Garden then how can we take him totally literally being that he is not in a closet, private room, or secret place (see Question #4 on my summary Post #374). How can Jesus say the publican is justified by praying in public in the temple if he also forbids public prayer??? If Jesus&#8217; teaching was so strict as you would have us believe then the publican would have to be condemned no matter his humility or intentions because he prayed in the open.",

   "I agree that we are saved by the grace of God, but John 3:16 says \"God so loved the world that he gave his only son, that all who believe in him may not die, but have eternal life\". This makes clear that faith alone is sufficient for salvation. I personally believe that the gift of faith is an act of God's grace, I also believe that it is possible that God offers this gift to those who die without believing - that seems to be implicit message of 2 Peter (IIRC), that God is delaying his judgement to allow people to believe. This would make little sense if death was the last opportunity, as each generation that dies faithless would be condemned, whereas souls would be saved by, after the first generation since Christ's resurrection had passed away, Christ returning within a few years.\n\n God calls men to him by grace as a free gift. We are saved by grace alone. But then men must decide to cooperate with God or to reject him--not by faith alone but by faith and works. There are certain instances where faith alone can save (the Church recognizes this in its teaching on baptism by desire-Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraph 1259 \"For catechumens who die before their Baptism, their explicit desire to receive it, together with repentance for their sins, and charity, assures them the salvation that they were not able to receive through the sacrament.\"-a catechumen is one who has not been baptized but has entered the formation process for becoming Catholic). But for most all of us who lead a \"normal length\" of life then faith and works are necessary. Faith must be maintained by good works and it can be nullified by bad works leading to a loss of salvation.\n \n The doctrine of sola fide as put forth by the Reformers is wrong. The Bible says that we are saved by faith (is a profession of faith an action, a work???). It does not say that we are saved by faith alone. Faith appears with alone in only one place in the bible. It is in James 2:24. (James 2:14-24: \"What does it profit, my brethren, if a man says he has faith but has not works? Can his faith save him?...So faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead...You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone...\")\n \n We are saved by faith and works. When Paul states that it is not by works that we are saved, he is speaking of works of the Jewish law. Christian works are distinct. And Paul's statements concerning faith are most often in the context of faith working in the love of good works.\n \n I agree with you on those who are not Christian having a chance to be saved. The Church also agrees with you. In the Catechism it states:\n \n \"847 This affirmation is not aimed at those who, through no fault of their own, do not know Christ and his Church: \n \n Those who, through no fault of their own, do not know the Gospel of Christ or his Church, but who nevertheless seek God with a sincere heart, and, moved by grace, try in their actions to do his will as they know it through the dictates of their conscience - those too may achieve eternal salvation.\"\n \n If you want to check out the Catechism of the Catholic Church (abbreviated CCC in most places) first hand then here is a web version:\n http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc.htm",

(The view of original sin wasn't as concrete yet--Augustine got that doctrine going strong.) While that's an attractive idea for those of us that don't like the idea that God would send people to hell, the problem with it is that it simply contradicts what is said in the Bible (which is, after all, the basis of our faith). The New Testament is very clear, both in the words of Christ and other books, that not everyone will be saved. So my response to this is to take what the Bible says, accept it, and trust that somehow God will be just. If He's really God, then it's not going to matter in the end whether we agree or approve of the way He's doing things anyway. IOW, I refuse to ignore or throw out what the Bible clearly says on this just because I would rather it be a different way.",

You will see that it is ALWAYS use in connection with the concept of \"far off\" or \"in private\". If it is not, please show me where it is not.\n \n As far as Luke 18:10-14, I suggest you (and your friend) look at verse 13 and explain why Jesus makes a point of describing the publican as standing \"far off\" when he is praying.\n \n All the best.\n\n Unfortunately for you and your interpretation, the publican is not \"far off\" enough to be outside of the Jewish place of public and communal worship, the synagogue. He is not far enough away to be in a secret place or closet. He is not far enough away that he couldn't be seen or heard. It says that the publican beat his breast and I don't doubt that there were any number of people walking around or praying in the synagogue that could see or hear that. (By the way, in discussing the Luke verse, I wonder what you think of Luke being a \"Paulist\" since you rejected Paul earlier. Being under the influence of Paul doesn't see to have distorted his gospel in any major way from the others).\n \n And Jesus was not far enough away in the public Garden of Gethsemane when he brought 11 other men with him to pray.\n \n Your failure to answer the difficult questions shows me that the Church has again prevailed as it has done throughout the ages. For this is not my battle but I have entered it for the Church. All I say is under the authority of Christ's Church to which I humbly submit. So when I boast, it is only in Christ, as St. Paul boasts. When I enter my arguments stimulated by free will and touched with dashes of original thought, it is in servitude to the Church. And what I do is only a minute addendum to the 2000 year foundation of gigantic thought that supports me.\n \n I have given you many straws. I'm sorry I could not hear your comments on some of these straws. The main ones are listed in summary in post #374. You have never addressed the worship of Jesus or the Transfiguration. You have never really answered to John 17 and John 11:41 but only pretend that Jesus \"asking\" or \"entreating\" God due to the original Greek is not a prayer. I suppose he was only posing rhetorical questions to God. You pretend that Jesus thanking God is not prayer. You pretend that Jesus blessing food is not prayer. I'm not sure that there is prayer at all if none of these qualify. You say that \n \n \nWhen the word \"proseuchomai\" is used to say that someone prayed, that person is always (by my reading) in a private space. \"proseuchomai\" is never used in reference to public activity. \n\n \n Then when I show you places where proseuchomai is used in public you tweak your concept to mean some sort of privacy or distance of your own judgment. Some of the earliest Christian writings, in addition to the Gospels, reinforce my point. Other books of scripture reinforce it (Hebrews 5:7, Acts 12:12, 13:3, 16:25, and 20:36).\n \n I also remind you of your failure to answer my question on war. The question is already answered by history. We know the Allied Powers in WWII acted nobly and righteously. So if all war is out of the question in Christian teaching then we have a problem-a contradiction. You don't realize that Jesus was always an activist, never a pacifist. Even in his submission on the cross he was active...actively saving all of mankind. Flashes of his activism we saw in his righteous anger in the temple--overthrowing and throwing out. Jesus' words and actions show that he would not have approved violence or war to pad one's ego, to gain personally, to manipulate, coerce, or oppress others. Jesus' idea of fighting would have been like the case of a child against a bully. The child should attempt to resist and circumnavigate that physical confrontation by all available means. Jesus would have known that the Christian going into a just war should be like the chivalrous knight who slaps down the bully abusing a woman...the bully harming the child, the weak, or the \"least of these.\" \n \n Perhaps the saddest aspect of your view is that it hinders a very natural inclination of man-spontaneity of prayer-no matter where he is, what he is doing, or whom he is with. That our life can be a prayer in all arenas is a powerful thing. But your view hinders that natural, prayerful expression of love man has for God in appreciation for the love God has shown man. Furthermore, it negates that expression of solidarity among humankind that unites us as the Body of Christ. It renders the community of believers mute and helpless, isolated in a closet. It distorts the \"kingdom within\" because there is no reaching out.\n \n I ask you to again consider the common man. How is he to know Jesus if he has not studied the Bible 16 years and had several years of philosophy and religion? Well, you might reply, \"By listening to educated persons like myself, who convey the Good News.\" But what happens when the next educated guy comes along with a different interpretation and teaches him another gospel? Jesus warned against this and protected against this. Going further then that, what about those who cannot learn?...the mentally challenged, children who are not yet mature, disabled, deaf, and blind who have no access to technological and educational support...can they receive Jesus? I reiterate, Jesus left us a sure mechanism for reaching them, a sure mechanism by which he could be present in their lives-through the Church and specifically through her sacraments. Jesus, the uncommon commoner, came with common sense for the common man. Jesus came into the physical and made it holy and he left us holy, concrete, and visible means of experiencing his invisible graces. The \"Kingdom within\" is fostered by the \"Kingdom without\" and vice-versa. Jesus fulfilled the \"Kingdom without\" (the Law) by emphasizing purity, authenticity, and truthfulness within. But he did not abolish the \"Kingdom without.\" He only made it new.\n \n You try to present yourself as broadening the narrow-minded institutional mindset of the organized religion of Catholicism. Yet you really attempt to narrow the broad view of the Church. It is just a new heresy (or perhaps an old one if I research it), as all heresies attempted to narrow the Church and make it less universal.\n \n I must say that you have been a worthy \"adversary.\" We were jousting but jousting involves knights. And what I have glimpsed of you thus far leads me to believe that you are a knight in life. Both of us have done what we should have done. And let us continue in the future to do what scripture calls us to:\n \n 1 Peter 3:15-16 \"Always be prepared to make a defense to any one who calls you to account for the hope that is in you, yet do it with gentleness and reverence; and keep your conscience clear, so that, when you are abused, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame.\"\n Colossians 3:16 \"Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, as you teach and admonish one another in all wisdom...\"\n \n (You should consider a Jesuit silent retreat...no talking the entire few days except for praying or spiritual direction...(of course there is open, communal prayer)...only men or only women so there are no distractions for interaction of the sexes... based upon the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola...a rewarding experience of growth in faith). \n \n Peace.",

I think he was a brilliant wordsmith - more brilliant perhaps that I believe if we had his original words in Hebrew and Aramaic. \n \n As far as the rest of your post, the personal invective was unnecessary and beneath you. \n \n Also, I have probably been on more Jesuit retreats than you can imagine.\n\n Howard,\n If the teachings were simple then they should be simply defended.

Go instead to my brothers and tell them, 'I am returning to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.' \" 18 Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news: \"I have seen the Lord!\" And she told them that he had said these things to her. \n \n John 20:19 - On the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples were together, with the doors locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, \"Peace be with you!\" 20 After he said this, he showed them his hands and side. The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord. \n \n John 20:26 - A week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, \"Peace be with you!\" 27 Then he said to Thomas, \"Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.\" \n 28 Thomas said to him, \"My Lord and my God!\" \n \n 1 Corinthians 15:3 - For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, 5and that he appeared to Peter, and then to the Twelve. 6 After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. 7 Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, 8 and last of all he appeared to me also... \n \n Acts 1:1 - In my former book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach 2 until the day he was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen. 3 After his suffering, he showed himself to these men and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive.

   "EZ:\n \n You don&#8217;t even bother to read what you post. You claim that verses from the Gospels prove eyewitness accounts. That is simply not true. There is no &#8220;eyewitness accounts&#8221; in the Gospels. The evidence overwhelmingly points to the probability that none of the writers of the Greek Gospels ever saw Jesus or heard him.\n \n A couple of the Epistles, particularly the Second Epistle of Peter, do claim that the writers were &#8220;eyewitnesses&#8221;. This cannot be simply dismissed despite the scholarship that supports the contention that the disciple Peter actually wrote it.\n \n \nLuke 24:30 - When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them. 31 Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight. 32 They asked each other, \"Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?\" \nWhy does it say he &#8220;gave it to &#8216;them&#8217;&#8221;, not &#8220;us&#8221;? &#8220;Us&#8221; is what you say when you are one of the &#8220;them&#8221;.\n \n \n33 They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem.

Neither were there.\n \n \nActs 1:1 - In my former book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach 2 until the day he was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen. 3 After his suffering, he showed himself to these men and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive. He appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God. 4 On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this command: \"Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about.\nSame issue &#8211; &#8220;them&#8221;, &#8220;these men&#8221;, etc. \n \n \n1 John 4:14 - And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. \nYou&#8217;re really tricky, EZ. It is disingenuous to pull verses of the Bible completely out of context. In context, it reads:\n \n 1 John 4:12: No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us. 13: Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit. 14: And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.\n \n The writer of this epistle is talking about God within him. He uses the rhetorical &#8220;we have seen and testify&#8221; &#8211; a proclaiming of faith.\n \n In addition, as early as 382 CE at The Council of Rome, church fathers acknowledged that the writer of the epistles of John may not be the author of the Gospel of John. That scholarly understanding has been supported by many new findings including the Dead Sea Scrolls. \n \n \n2 Peter 1:16 - We did not follow cleverly invented stories when we told you about the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.\nEven though there is mounting scholarship showing that the disciple Peter did not write this epistle, I still think that there is evidence that he may have. For that reason, this epistle must (in my opinion) be examined carefully.\n \n If this epistle was written by the disciple Peter, then it becomes very disturbing to me that other scripture allegedly written by the disciple Peter were excluded from the Bible &#8211; particularly the Apocalypse of Peter &#8211; all copies of which disappeared after it was barred from being included in the Biblical canon.\n \n However, what Peter wrote are his words, not the words of Jesus and as such much be examined from that perspective &#8211; as should the words of teachings of Paul and Timothy and John. \n \n \nLuke 1:1 - Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us, 2 just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. 3 Therefore, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, 4 so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught. \nThe author here acknowledges that he was not an eyewitness.\n \n \nMatthew 28:5 - The angel said to the women, \"Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. 6 He is not here; he has risen, just as he said.

The final word on the teachings of Jesus is from the Church--the bishops in communion with the pope. It is not one Jesuit here and one school there, etc. The Church teaching is that public, open, communal prayer is okay if it is not done with vanity, impurity of heart, or bad intentions.\n \n \nYou misunderstood me. I accept that it may be their impression of what happened. I do not accept that their impression is accurate - especially since many of their impressions may not have been formed through eyewitness accounts.\n \n As for Jesus teachings, I believe they are so powerful that they withstand the defects of human memory, perception and impression. However, the fact that Jesus spoke in Aramaic and Hebrew (most likely) and that the Gospel writers were not eyewitnesses to his ministry (most likely) and the possibility that the Gospel writers had other agendas that may have influenced their writings, must be taken into account as one reads.\n\n I am still uncertain how you have come to your belief that Jesus protects these chosen authors when they say certain teachings that you designate but he would not protect them on other impressions. Did he not care for them more than that? Did he not lead them into \"all the truth\" as John tells us? I am really uncertain on how you have determined \"their impression\" versus \"authentic teaching of Jesus.\"\n \n I believe that most Biblical scholars support the idea that the Gospels of Matthew and John were written by apostles do they not?",

The reason I went into such detail about Jesus' concept of prayer is that what he teaches is very clear in the Greek. Any Greek scholar would have to agree that \"proseuchomai\", \" eulogeo\" and \"eratao\" are different words with different meanings. That much is elementary. I went into great detail in hopes that you could hear what I was saying. You could not.

That is why I love Dan Boorstin's thought: The problem was not ignorance; the problem was the illusion of knowledge. \n \n There are Catholic Church theologians who are constantly investigating questions like the teaching of Jesus on prayer and the Biblical commandment regarding graven images. These theologians question the old interpretations by the Church and present new understandings. As I am sure you know, the Society of Jesus is comprised of some of the most ruthlessly analytical and fearlessly cutting edge intellectuals and theologians in Church history. If you understand anything about the Society of Jesus, and you have any idea what it means to study theology and philosophy for eight years with them as I told you I have, you will know what I mean when I say that I have taken these issues to the Church.\n \n The theological teachings of the Catholic Church today are not the same as those of a thousand years ago. Each generation has added to or changed some aspect(s) of it. Some generations have apologized for the actions of previous generations. The position that all things that the Catholic Church holds true today will be held true tomorrow is not a highly rated point of view with many Church theologians; otherwise there would be no need for additional thought and analysis. There is an understanding that the Church will change from what it is today into something new and different. There are those who see that the Church is one of those institutions in the world (and there are only a few) which can bring together disparate peoples and religions, not in the unity of Jesus, but in the unity of truth and his teachings. John XXIII was moving in that direction, so was Paul after him. Political power has swung back to a much rigid orthodoxy in recent years, but just like in the US, the pendulum will swing back.\n \n As to the specific I mentioned as one of the things I had discussed with the \"church\" as I identified it, it was regarding Jesus' concept of prayer, the use of 3 different Greek words with three different meanings, the fact that one of those words which Jesus identified specifically as prayer in Matthew 6:5 (proseuchomai) always was used in conjunction with the concept of privacy, and that the other two words had different meanings and were not even translated as \"pray\" or \"prayer\" and were not used on conjunction with privacy.\n \n \nThe final word on the teachings of Jesus is from the Church--the bishops in communion with the pope.\nNo, it doesn't. Any theologian knows that. The Pope decrees Church dogma. The final word on the teachings Jesus lies in the words of Jesus. Jesus' teaching did not support all of the Church extrapolations, Papal decrees and actions done in his name in decades past and almost assuredly will not support some of them in effect today in the future. As rigid and dogmatic as the Church is, it will not hold onto old positions that have been obviously exposed as unsupportable and/or that may threaten a loss of too many patrons.\n \n \nI am still uncertain how you have come to your belief that Jesus protects these chosen authors when they say certain teachings that you designate but he would not protect them on other impressions. Did he not care for them more than that? Did he not lead them into \"all the truth\" as John tells us? I am really uncertain on how you have determined \"their impression\" versus \"authentic teaching of Jesus.\"\nI did not mean to imply that \"Jesus protects\" the authors. What I meant was that Jesus' message is so clear and so consistent and so powerful that even if they got only half of it exactly correct, the message would still come blazing through; even if they took the words out of context, the truth of the teachings would overcome that, even of they put some additional words in his mouth, the power of his real message would shrivel the false words to cinders. That is why it is so important to understand Jesus' teachings and words in the context of all his teachings and words and not take one verse or one chapter out of that context. It is only when we place the verse or chapter we are examining against the background of the complete extant teachings of Jesus that we can discern the merit and meaning of the verse or chapter.\n \n \nI believe that most Biblical scholars support the idea that the Gospels of Matthew and John were written by apostles do they not?\nSimply put, no they do not.",

   "Howard,\n \nI am not interested in proving points or supporting dogma when it comes to the words of Jesus. I am interested in coming to a deeper understanding of his teachings. The reason I went into such detail about Jesus&#8217; concept of prayer is that what he teaches is very clear in the Greek. Any Greek scholar would have to agree that &#8220;proseuchomai&#8221;, &#8221; eulogeo&#8221; and &#8220;eratao&#8221; are different words with different meanings. That much is elementary. I went into great detail in hopes that you could hear what I was saying. You could not. Perhaps that is the fault of my limited abilities to make things clear.\n\n But I believe I have presented contradictions in your position according to scripture that you cannot reconcile. The picture presented by the totality of scripture indicates that the Church has it right on open, communal prayer.\n \n By the way, concerning our discussion on poverty for the kingdom, I have come upon more scripture supporting my poinjt of view. I know I said you shouldn't bring it back up but I must. I know you constantly charge me with spouting Church propaganda but I believe that I have done a fair job of supporting what I say with scripture and Holy Tradition. So I must now give you more scripture to ensure that you don't think I am only putting forth Church propaganda. At your convenience please read Luke 19:1-10 about the rich man Zacchaeus who gave away half of his possessions. Jesus proclaims that salvation has come to his house without giving up all possessions. Also Matthew 25:14-30, that teaches us that to whom much has been given, more responsibility is given, and more work for the Kingdom is demanded.\n \n \nI am not going to, nor do I believe I need to, delineate my credentials. As Confucius said, &#8220;Often the dumbest boy in the class knows the best road to school&#8221; -- or was that Charlie Chan?\n\n I wasn't demanding credentials as I have none in the realm of theology, philosophy, or scriptural study other than being a faithful follower of the Church.\n \n \nI listen to what people have to say, knowing that I always have more to learn and that it is only my boated nothingness (as Emerson said) that stands in my way. That is why I love Dan Boorstin&#8217;s thought: The problem was not ignorance; the problem was the illusion of knowledge.\n \n Good method. I try to do the same. But I measure all by Jesus' Church.\n \n \nThere are Catholic Church theologians who are constantly investigating questions like the teaching of Jesus on prayer and the Biblical commandment regarding graven images. These theologians question the old interpretations by the Church and present new understandings. As I am sure you know, the Society of Jesus is comprised of some of the most ruthlessly analytical and fearlessly cutting edge intellectuals and theologians in Church history. If you understand anything about the Society of Jesus, and you have any idea what it means to study theology and philosophy for eight years with them as I told you I have, you will know what I mean when I say that I have taken these issues to the Church.\n\n Yes, theologians always have and always will continue to study and hypothesize. Especially the Jesuits. Although many fall into a category too liberal for me. But there is nothing wrong with continuing study and understanding as long as it doesn't conflict with the basic deposit of faith.\n \n \nThe theological teachings of the Catholic Church today are not the same as those of a thousand years ago. Each generation has added to or changed some aspect(s) of it. Some generations have apologized for the actions of previous generations. The position that all things that the Catholic Church holds true today will be held true tomorrow is not a highly rated point of view with many Church theologians; otherwise there would be no need for additional thought and analysis. There is an understanding that the Church will change from what it is today into something new and different.

John XXIII was moving in that direction, so was Paul after him. Political power has swung back to a much rigid orthodoxy in recent years, but just like in the US, the pendulum will swing back.\n\n Yes, there are theological developments, there are new scriptural insights, new history discovered. There is also a development of doctrine. This is liking peeling off the layers of a cabbage to find the deepest innermost part of it. But a development of doctrine or theology cannot conflict with the revelation of Jesus. It cannot reveal contradictions in the faith and worship of the Church. Your assertions would mean there was a contradiction in the faith and worship of the Church. I contest that there is not.\n \n \nAs to the specific I mentioned as one of the things I had discussed with the &#8220;church&#8221; as I identified it, it was regarding Jesus&#8217; concept of prayer, the use of 3 different Greek words with three different meanings, the fact that one of those words which Jesus identified specifically as prayer in Matthew 6:5 (proseuchomai) always was used in conjunction with the concept of privacy, and that the other two words had different meanings and were not even translated as &#8220;pray&#8221; or &#8220;prayer&#8221; and were not used on conjunction with privacy.\n\n Again, I have not seen you reconcile this with some of the problems I presented. Your hypothesis does not stand up to scrutiny.\n \n \nNo, it doesn&#8217;t. Any theologian knows that. The Pope decrees Church dogma. The final word on the teachings Jesus lies in the words of Jesus. Jesus&#8217; teaching did not support all of the Church extrapolations, Papal decrees and actions done in his name in decades past and almost assuredly will not support some of them in effect today in the future. As rigid and dogmatic as the Church is, it will not hold onto old positions that have been obviously exposed as unsupportable and/or that may threaten a loss of too many patrons.\n\n Yes, the words of Jesus are final. The Church is the appointed spokesman of Jesus that interprets these words. So the Church has the final say on what theology is correct and consistent with the Revelation of Christ and what theology is not. The Church was given the power to bind and loose.\n \n \nI did not mean to imply that &#8220;Jesus protects&#8221; the authors. What I meant was that Jesus&#8217; message is so clear and so consistent and so powerful that even if they got only half of it exactly correct, the message would still come blazing through; even if they took the words out of context, the truth of the teachings would overcome that, even of they put some additional words in his mouth, the power of his real message would shrivel the false words to cinders. That is why it is so important to understand Jesus' teachings and words in the context of all his teachings and words and not take one verse or one chapter out of that context. It is only when we place the verse or chapter we are examining against the background of the complete extant teachings of Jesus that we can discern the merit and meaning of the verse or chapter.\n\n If Jesus' words are so blazingly clear, I again ask why there are 33,000 denominations each with its own clear understanding of Jesus. There has to be a unifying entity with authority to hold the truth together. Otherwise, it is splintered into a confused, meaningless, manic soup.\n \n AMEN on the one verse out of context!",

   "Maximus:\n \n I have quoted Meier below in places that he acknowledges the validity of various Catholic theological positions that are neither traditional nor orthodox. Rather than quote the entire article, I have quoted excerpts. There is no intention of twisting his words to mean something different than they do in context.\n \n We can discuss them one at a time &#8211; which might be better, but I am putting them all on one post to respond to your query. I put the words in bold into bold face type for emphesis.\n \n \nThe resurrection of Jesus is certainly supremely real. However, not everything that is real either exists in time and space or is empirically verifiable by historical means.\n \n Thus the risen body of Jesus is indeed in continuity with the body laid to rest in the tomb. But nevertheless it has undergone radical transformation as a glorified, risen body. It is no longer of this world of time and space and not subject to its laws....There is a whole range of speculative possibilities about the precise relationship of the risen Jesus to the body laid in the tomb.\n \n Notice the Church has never required for membership that you must accept Augustine&#8217;s neo-Platonic understanding of the Trinity by way of an intellectual analogy. Catholics are not required to accept the whole Thomistic, neo-Aristotelian system of the Middle Ages, or accept Karl Rahner or Bernard Lonergan&#8217;s 20th-century understanding of Christology. The Church has never imposed the grand philosophical system of the day on ordinary believers as a necessary part of believing\n \n Precisely when there&#8217;s great ferment there&#8217;s going to be a lot of arguing back and forth and a lot of negating of positions. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with that&#8230;. I think it&#8217;s a positive stimulus\n \n When you find out that Jesus actually was a radical egalitarian feminist socialist with a social agenda, one cannot help but think that a great deal of politically correct 80&#8217;s and 90&#8217;s academic life is being read back into this first-century Jew.\n\n \n In this interview, Fr. Meier is being very tactful and careful about what he says. Not as avoidance but because he knows that this is not the venue in which to bring up controversial theological ideas that cannot be fully explained in a short interview. He is very conscious of being quoted out of context (which he has been more than once) and having to defend something that he really did not say, but because he could not fully explain in the format was open to a different interpretation than what he actually was attempting to say. You will find many theologians to be extremely careful in this way. In private working session and brainstorming it is very different.",

Isaiah 63:10 reads,\n \n \"But they rebelled, and vexed His Holy Spirit: therefore He was\n turned to be their enemy, and He fought against them.\"\n \n The word \"vexed,\" as used above, is the Hebrew word \"atsab,\" which means \"to worry, pain, or anger; to grieve, hurt, or make sorry\" (Zodhiates Old Testament Word Study - Hebrew and Chaldee Dictionary section, page 91).

Why does Jesus refers to it as a \"house of prayer\" if open prayer was forbidden? The noun used is \"proseukeis\" in the Greek, I believe.\n \n The story is also in Matthew 21:12-13, Mark 11:17.

Jesus makes it a point of saying that the publican is \"afar off\": \"And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as [his] eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.\" (Luke 18:13) He was in the temple but \"afar off\" praying in private. So Jesus did not criticize Jews who prayed in the temple, that was the way of the Old Covenant, but he did make it a point of saying that the admirable man in this parable, even though he was a Jew, even though he was praying in the temple, did so from \"afar off\". Nonetheless, he did teach the disciples of the New Covenant to pray in private. There is no contradiction. As he did with so many other Old Covenant teachings, he updated clarified and reinterpreted them for us.\n \n In addition, we still must take into account that nowhere did Jesus lead anyone in public or group prayer. Nowhere does he knell and say, \"Let us pray...\" Nowhere does he instruct any of the disciples in how to lead a public prayer.

He simply criticized the Pharisees who were loudly, openly praying in vanity for attention. Did he let the Old Covenant view of the Sabbath stand? Did he let the Old Covenant view of stoning adulterers stand? Yes, he updated, clarified, and reinterpreted and let stand what was already in accord with the enlightened Law.\n \n He came to fulfill the Law, not to abolish it. So if he was fulfilling the Law then Jews and Jewish Christians would both be subject to practicing the fulfilled law, I would think. Not sure why he would make a distinction.\n \n Did the Jews of the Old Covenant always pray \"afar off\" in the temple or would it be their practice to pray anywhere in the temple? Jesus forbade the Apostles, the Jewish Christians from praying in their old way? What is your definition of \"private\" in your statement on his teaching of the apostles--in a private room, closet, or secret place? If you look at the history of the Church, the Christians continued praying with the Jews as they always had. They added breaking of the bread on Sundays in addition to that. They only discontinued this when the 19th Benediction was formulated by the Jews.\n \n If I wanted to pray in a public place today but \"afar off\" then do you think that would be allowed by Jesus? Would I be subject to the rules of the publican allowing me to pray \"afar off\" in public or would I be subject to the rules of the apostles which I thought you had proposed initially as being in a private place.",

I suggest that you take all the verses from the Gospels where the Greek word \"proseuchomai\" is used and read them in relation to each other.

   "Public Prayer (from a prior posting)\n \n Public prayer to show off in vanity is wrong (as Jesus said), sincere public prayer is perfectly okay. What do you think the Jews did when they gathered? Do you think before or after someone taught on scripture about God that they might have prayed? What about scripture being taught in public in the first place? Jesus was not afraid of proclaiming God in public, nor were his disciples. Silent, solitary prayer is great. But there is nothing wrong with communal, public prayer either.\n \n In Matthew 26:41 why did he tell them to watch and pray while he went off? Weren't all of these men in a group together? \"Public prayer,\" is it not?\n \n Furthermore, Jesus sang a hymn with the apostles before leaving for the Garden after the Last Supper (Matthew 26:30). What do you think that hymn was about? What is a hymn? Is it a prayer?\n \n A few other questions come up in regard to open, public prayer: \n \n In Matthew 26:26 Jesus blessed the bread. Again, what is a blessing but a prayer? Is a prayer before meals in public violating Jesus' commands?\n \n **** In Matthew 19:13 Jesus laid hands on the children and PRAYED for them. Was this a public prayer?\n \n If we were to be isolated in our prayer then why did Jesus teach us to pray Our Father instead of My Father? Since the Our Father is a \"prayer\" taken right out of scripture then is it prayer or teaching of scripture when it is recited?\n \n Did Jesus condemn all public prayer of Jews or just that of the Pharisees that was vain and hypocritical? (Luke 1:10, Luke 2:37 , I doubt he would condemn Zechariah, his uncle, the father of John the Baptist, or the widow)\n \n If prayer was only to be in isolation as instructed by Jesus then why did his inner circle meet to \"break bread\" commemorating the Lord's Supper in the book of Acts? I find it hard to believe that no prayers would have been said at those gatherings. I find it hard to believe that all of those learning directly from Jesus would have gotten the message wrong.(Acts 20)",

   "So Jesus did not criticize Jews who prayed in the temple, that was the way of the Old Covenant, but he did make it a point of saying that the admirable man in this parable, even though he was a Jew, even though he was praying in the temple, did so from \"afar off\".

If I did, then I apologize. If I didn't, and Jesus came to fulfill the Law, then why would he make this distinction?\nNo, trebor is correct about that. It is Paul who does that. It doesn't seem clear that Jesus saw a distinction other than between those who understand (can hear) and those who cannot. See Matthew 13:10-17\n \n \nJews would be held to the same standard of Jewish Christians as he held them to the same standard with the new interpretation of resting on the Sabbath, stoning adulterers, etc.\nJesus taught the disciples how to pray. Jesus showed by example by never praying in public or leading a public prayer. He reprimanded those who prayed publicly and in vain repetitions. Jesus was a teacher. He understood full well that those he was teaching would not \"get it\" in one day or one month or one year. It seems clear to me that he understood himself to be the sower of the seed of new ideas that would be difficult for people to grasp because of old ways, old teachings and old habits. Jesus understood and said so (in his parables) that between planting a seed and reaping a harvest there is time. He was not a fire and brimstone preacher cursing and damning people all the time. He taught, explained, and repeated the same theme in different ways.\n \n \nIf I wanted to pray in a public place today but \"afar off\" then do you think that would be allowed by Jesus? \nI don't know what Jesus would allow because I don't think it works that way. If you went to a cooking class and the teacher (assuming here a good teacher) taught you how to make a cake, they are not telling you the only way, they are teaching you the best way that they know. Could you improve on it? Maybe. If the teacher were Jesus and the teachings were about spiritual truth could you improve on it? I don't think so. But all things are possible as Jesus said, \"All this I do, you too can do and more...: It was not one of his commandments to prayer in private. For the most part Jesus was a teacher not a law giver like Moses. When asked what his commandments were he said, \"Love God...\" and \"Love you neighbor...\" and \"Love one another...\"\n \n \nWould I be subject to the rules of the publican allowing me to pray \"afar off\" in public or would I be subject to the rules of the apostles which I thought you had proposed initially as being in a private place (if you were, in fact, attempting to make a distinction as I read it).\nYou are looking for Jesus the rule maker, law giver and judge. That is not the Jesus of the Gospels. That is the Jesus image that has been promulgated by some of his followers who have missed the mark. The Jesus of the Gospels is much more an empathetic and compassionate teacher. He can be tough like a good shepherd on his sheep if they are wandering into danger, but for the most part he is humble, compassionate.\n \n \nNow you say that it can be in public but \"far off.\" That qualifies, in your interpretation, as a private place, secret room, or closet. The Garden of Gethsemane also qualifies according to your interpretation. Neither of these seem very private as I have related time and time again.\nI only bring to your attention what Jesus taught. I also bring to you attention that he never taught what kind of prayer to lead in public, he never instructed his disciples to participate in or lead public prayer and he never participated in or lead public prayer himself. The words, \"Let us pray together...\" are never spoken by Jesus in the Gospels. The fact that the Gospel writers chose to indicate that Jesus went \"afar off\" or \"a stone's throw off\" when he prayed might show that he did that or that the writer believed Jesus teaching and was enforcing it. I am always more interested in Jesus teaching than I am in the physical events around those teachings because there are discrepancies between the four writers about those physical things, but as far as Jesus' teachings, there is not much discrepancy.\n \n \nAsk (including asking for forgiveness and blessings from God)/desire/ entreat (eratao); blessing (eulogeo); praise, thanksgiving, and singing hymns have all been eliminated as prayer in your view.\nJesus uses different words. I think that it is incumbent upon us to explore that from the point of view that Jesus meant what he said. That is my view. Once you examine when and where those words are used, a very clear picture comes into view. Jesus suggests a pertinent difference between \"pray\", \"bless\" and \"ask\". He teaches us to pray (proseuchomai) in private. \"eulogeo\" does have the connotation of celebrating - thanking. And \"eratao\" does have the connotation of \"asking\". Jesus does not teach us that those are to be done in private. These are very complex issues and connect with many of Jesus' teachings - the Father knows what you need before you ask, ask and it will be given, and the like. These are wonderfully rich theological waters but are not germane. \n \n \nSo we are left with proseuchomai. But I'm trying to understand what that word means, being that asking, entreating, praising, blessing, and thanksgiving to God have been eliminated from prayer. \nYou have zeroed in on the issue with laser precision. Jesus did not consider them \"proseuchomai\". \"proseuchomai\" somehow is different. What did he mean?\n \n As you can see, is questioning and probing and discarding preconception, we are not left with a pat answer, we are left with a question. How much richer will our spiritual life be if we understand that \"asking\" is not the same as \"praising\" which is not the same as \"blessing\" or \"thanking\" or \"celebrating\". All those things are wonderful expression of our relationship with God; but there is something else. Something that underpins those other perhaps. Jesus did not teach us how to bless or how to praise. He said we should do those things, but he did not give the detailed lesson on them that he did on \"proseuchomai\".\n \n \nYou also have not answered if you pray the formulaic \"Our Father\" as Jesus specifically instructed. Prayer seems a bit empty without all of those things. What is left? What do you do when you pray?\nJesus taught against \"vain repetition\" when it came to prayer. It is not a stretch to conclude that he would not intend for the prayer he taught to be repeated word for word. That does not mean he would oppose it, I think it would mean that when the words lost their full meaning we would need to do whatever we needed to so that our prayers did not become \"vain\" repetitions. When Jesus taught how to pray, he said \"pray in this way\", he did not say \"pray using these words\". Jesus put a wealth of fertile spiritual understandings into the simple words of what we call \"The Lord's Prayer\". To truly understand what Jesus was teaching, we have to understand that prayer and all the spiritual concepts in it. \n \n \nLastly, does Father Meier agree with your position on public prayer being that you two are from the same \"church?\" I'm still not sure of his significance in our debate.\nI'd rather not talk for others. I was simply bringing to your attention one of a number of Biblical historians and theologians with whom these things have been and are being discussed. Someone on the forum referred to him and I found the article by him and I forwarded it to you. I think that he is from the same \"church\" as you are as well. His only significance in our discourse (I do not consider this exchange of ideas a debate) is that he is probing and questioning in the same way in simliar areas.",

   "The Greek is very clear and the English translation reflects that. Simply put, people brought children to Jesus so that he would ay his hands on them and pray with them. The disciples stood in the way and Jesus said no, let the children come to him. He then put his hands on them. Nowhere does it say that he prayed with them. That is clear in both the English and the Greek.\n\n Yes, Jesus said that there are some who cannot hear, some who cannot see, and we know that there were many throughout the ages who could not read. It has taken you 16 years of study to formulate some of the eccentric ideas that you have, including your position on prayer. I ask you again to come back to the common man. Jesus was not so esoteric, though he could be very deep. After all, he called commoners to follow him, fishermen, tax collectors...These men went out after his death and founded churches, said Mass, and prayed with the Body of Christ. These men that walked with Jesus did not get it wrong. \n \n I now better understand what you are meaning in regard to Matthew 19:13 though. The children came to Jesus for laying on of hands and prayer. You are asking us to believe that the disciples rebuked them for one or both of these reasons: either because they wanted Jesus to pray in public with them or because they wanted to get close to Jesus. Jesus corrected the disciples and allowed the children to come to him. But he only laid hands on the children and did not pray with them? The author seems to indicate that laying on of hands was accompanied by prayer. You are putting your slant on things. You are taking more away from this passage than EZ or I are putting into it. You want us to delete the prayer from the laying on of hands. But there is no context for that. \n \n Disciples: \"No, you can't come to Jesus for praying or healing.\" Jesus:\"Yes, let them come to me but only for laying on of hands. No praying.\"\n \n You claim that EZ's distortion of Jesus' teaching is outright lying, despicable, close to the Anti-Christ, and shameful. Very strong words indeed. When interpreting scripture, there is not simply a danger of adding to what Jesus said to make it something other than it was. There is also a danger of reducing scripture to what it was not or confining it to extremes. We know that Jesus, did in fact, pray with the children. See the parallel passage of Mark 10:16. Is there a possible interchange of proseuchomai and eulogeo when looking at these passages together? I think so. Are we to think that the children were asking to pray with Jesus in some other form or fashion in Matthew 19 besides being blessed? Would a blessing go with laying on of hands? \n \n So now we end up, after looking at the parallel passages in Mark and completing our paraphrased dialogue above with Jesus' last statement being modified: Jesus, \"Yes, let them come to me but only for laying on of hands. Well, okay, for blessings too. But remember blessings are not prayers!\" \"And pray in a closet, secret room, or private place except when you go to the temple or the Garden.\" The common man knows better.\n \n Let us pray that we may be able to see and hear.\n \n Peace.",

When I mentioned those who couldn't read I meant it. I was not referring to you but rather to the illiteracy of the ages. \n \n I just can't think of the \"house of proseukeis\" in Luke 19:45-46 as a \"public house of 'far off' prayer.\" I think this use of proseuchomai demonstrates very clearly that your interpretation is wrong. I don't think Jesus would have said pray in a closet, a private room, or a secret place with your meaning and then said the things he said. The temple was not a closet, a private room, or a secret place. Nor was the Garden. He had to be censuring the Pharisees for their ostentatious, impure, ulterior motivated prayer. But this does not condemn communal or public prayer--because it links us to the Body of Christ.\n \n I also think the cross referencing of Matthew 19:13 and Mark 10:16 is striking. I think it shows another serious flaw in your interpretation concerning proseuchomai and its possible synonymous interchange with eulogeo. (especially if these gospels might by chance have been written originally in Aramaic where there was no punctuation and syntax may have been left up to those who put it into the Greek--just a tangential thought. I believe the comparison of the two presentations of the story is striking enought without this conjecture). Luke 18:10-14 refutes your theory as well.\n \n Then there is the prayer of Jesus in John 17 and John 11:41. There are his blessings of meals and people, his singing of hymns, and his words on the cross. All of these show us that Jesus prayed openly, in public, and with others. \n \n But I now cease and desist. We have no more ammunition. We are not making progress. I wish you the best. Keep seeking Jesus and I will too.\n \n Peace of Christ.",

Perhaps you could begin with a defense of the biblical notion of a geocentric universe with heaven existing in a physical location somewhere in the sky above the earth, a solid dome of 'firmament' above the earth from which the stars and planets are suspended, stars as tiny points of light, Adam & Eve as historical personages, Noah's flood, an improbable Exodus story, the sun and moon standing still for an entire day, disease caused by demons, dead people getting out of their graves and partying in Jerusalem, or that Jesus' followers could drink poison without fear of harm, or of explicit NT references to Jesus' imminent second coming, heralding the end of all things earthly?",

(no unsubstantiated liberal THEORIES, please, just the facts)\n\n \n Burden-of-proof errors come naturally to you, don't they? You like to claim that a sceptic's view of the bible (as a purely man-made anthology of more-or-less ancient myth, legend and polemic) requires the same evidence to support it as your proposal that it is the inerrant word of god.\n \n This claim of symmetry or equivalence between the evidential burdens of the two sides is bogus. You and I know that man-made anthologies of myth, legend and polemic do indeed exist: you presumably regard the sacred scriptures of all religions other than your own as just that.\n \n The sceptic therefore regards the judaeochristian bible as just one example of a class of objects whose existence is universally acknowledged. Your position is that it is in fact uniquely different, despite having no more a priori evidence in its favour than any of the others. The burden of proof is very clearly on you.",

   "Howard,\n I was not attempting ridicule or misrepresentation. Sometimes I write for dramatic effect. When I mentioned those who couldn't read I meant it. I was not referring to you but rather to the illiteracy of the ages. \n \n I just can't think of the \"house of proseukeis\" in Luke 19:45-46 as a \"public house of 'far off' prayer.\" I think this use of proseuchomai demonstrates very clearly that your interpretation is wrong. I don't think Jesus would have said pray in a closet, a private room, or a secret place with your meaning and then said the things he said. The temple was not a closet, a private room, or a secret place. Nor was the Garden. He had to be censuring the Pharisees for their ostentatious, impure, ulterior motivated prayer. But this does not condemn communal or public prayer--because it links us to the Body of Christ.\n \n I also think the cross referencing of Matthew 19:13 and Mark 10:16 is striking. I think it shows another serious flaw in your interpretation concerning proseuchomai and its possible synonymous interchange with eulogeo. (especially if these gospels might by chance have been written originally in Aramaic where there was no punctuation and syntax may have been left up to those who put it into the Greek--just a tangential thought. I believe the comparison of the two presentations of the story is striking enought without this conjecture). Luke 18:10-14 refutes your theory as well.\n \n Then there is the prayer of Jesus in John 17 and John 11:41. There are his blessings of meals and people, his singing of hymns, and his words on the cross. All of these show us that Jesus prayed openly, in public, and with others. \n \n But I now cease and desist. We have no more ammunition. We are not making progress. I wish you the best. Keep seeking Jesus and I will too.\n \n Peace of Christ.\nI can only continue to urge you to look at the use of the word \"proseuche\" in the gospels. Whenever anyone is described as being engaged in \"proseuche\" there is always an implication of privacy. And there still is Matthew 6:6 to deal with. It is still the only specific teaching of Jesus on how we should pray. I am not condemning singing hyms or expressing thanks or praising creation, I am trying to point out that there is another fundamental practice that Jesus taught that is different than those. Old Testament worship took the form of hymns and praise and giving thanks, but perhaps Jesus in the New Testament teaches a new practice to help us understand God's will for us, and that practice is \"proseuchomai\". Something we do alone, in private. Remember Jesus saying \"Seek first the Kingdom...\" and remember that he also said that \"The kingdom of heaven is within you!\" \"proseuchomai\" may very well be his teaching to show us the way to accessing that kingdom of heaven that is within us. If we explore the \"Our Father\" from that perspective, we may get a completely different understanding of the prayer.\n \n BTW, I am not alone in this and it is not in any way a violation of the teachings of the Catholic Church. The Cistercians and Benedictines as well as other monastics have long understood this practice. I believe that the practice which they have kept alive is one that Jesus was encouraging the average man to engage in because if we express ourselves only to the kingdom outside of ourselves, we are out of balance because the kingdom is both within and outside of us and unless we grasp that we cannot see our place within creation. This may be a source of many of the problems in Christianity and in the world. \"Seek first the kingdom and all else will follow...\"",

You also implied in your arguments that public/communal prayer in any form was not in accord with the teachings of Jesus. The Church seemed to be doing something wrong in your opinion.\n \n (Will you ever let us in on if you pray the Our Father as Jesus taught?)\nPlease read what I said more carefully. Here is exactly what I said:\nMt 6:5: And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. 6: But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.\n \n All those services in Churches and in Vatican Square are in direct opposition to this.\nYour characterization of what I said -- \"You stated that the Church's mass/praise/worship was in violation of Jesus' teachings\" -- is a misrepresentation of my words, however, I grant that I may have been unclear at times and that the subject is a subtle one, so I do not think you misrepresented purposefully. I never criticized public blessing -- as Jesus did and spoke of. (I do not agree with much of what is done in public and called \"blessing\" today because it is not in the image of Jesus teaching and actions - but that is another discussion.)\n \n With that said...\n \n You may recall that I was specifically discussing what Jesus referred to as \"proseuchomai\". That is the Greek word Jesus uses in Matthew 6. I was drawing the distinction between that and \"eulogeo\" and \"eratao\", both of which have completely different meanings than \"proseuchomai\". Eulogeo is best translated as \"praise\". It is the root of the English word eulogize and eulogy; eratao means beseech or entreat. In Vatican Square the public is lead in prayer. Sometimes the very prayer that Jesus taught should be prayed in secret, the \"Our Father\". That appears to me to be (as I said) in direct opposition to the teaching of Jesus in Matthew 6. In fact, the fact that the Catholic Church does not make a distinction between the three also is a failure on the Church's part to follow the teachings of Jesus. Jesus defines \"prayer\", \"praise\" and \"entreaty\" as three different practices. \"Praise\" is definitely a public practice because it requires others to be present. \"Entreat\" can be a public practice or a private practice - personal or communal. \"Prayer\" is definitely a personal not communal practice (Mt 6) because it is to be done in private. When a public service steps from praise and entreaty to prayer (let us pray), it seems to me to be in violation of Jesus teachings on prayer.\n \n There are serious historical and theological reasons to grapple with the distinctions between prayer, praise and entreaty. The understanding of prayer as private and personal is losing it place of importance in Christian practices - even Catholic ones. The small groups of believers who maintain the distinction (such as silent retreats) have forgotten (for the most part) that prayer \"proseuchomai\" and the privacy of it is one of the seminal teachings of Jesus. I think that the loss of this practice and the principles underpinning it also have effects on things such as personal responsibility, personal morality and personal God-consciousness. I fear that we are moving closer and closer to becoming 21st century Scribes and Pharisees for whom Jesus showed little patience, and that the Church is dangerously close to becoming part of the problem, not the solution.",
