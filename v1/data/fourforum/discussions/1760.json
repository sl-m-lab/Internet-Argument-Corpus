   "A flat Tax is very bad,  until you stop the enormous flow of wealth back to the top with very little flowing back down and eliminate the enormous control the wealthy have on who makes what in this country you will never have a fair tax system. A flat tax would be great if the republicans would abandon there philosophy of horde the wealth and F*@#% the wretched poor, Hooray for me and the hell with you! Look at the tax structure they favor, you work your XXX off and you pay 28%-30% and they sit on their XXX and pay 15% on their dividends and capital gains. They say that the key to high paying jobs is higher education which is true but who is constantly assailing public education and sitting back and doing nothing when college, public or private becomes so expensive it is beyond the reach of most Americans other than the cultural elite, Give me an R! I guess they will never understand the meaning of society.\n \n PS: people who shop at Wal-Mart are there own worst enemy!",

The issue is that there is some \"bad education\" being presented in this forum to dupe you and me into believing that we don't have to pay taxes.\n \n Title 26 Subtitle A Chapter 1 Subchapter B gives you all the definitions you need (http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/stAch1schB.html).\n \n Title 26 Subtitle F Chapter 78 gives you the \"Discovery of Liability and Enforcement of Title\" (http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/stFch78.html).\n \n The trickery being used here is that the word \"income\" itself is not defined. Because it is not specifically defined, then you are not required to pay taxes. The reason is that the money you received may not be \"income\" at all and therefore may not be \"gross income\".\n \n Well, the definition of \"gross income\" uses other words like \"services\", \"compensation\", \"fees\", \"commissions\", \"rents\", \"royalities\", \"dividends\", etc. It even uses obviously complicated phrases like \"including (but not limited to) the following items\". What do you mean by \"items\"? And what does \"not limited to\" mean?\n \n These other words (much less the complicated phrases) are not defined, either. So even if the word \"income\" was defined, these other words would have to be defined as well. Otherwise, \"gross income\" (which is used to calculate \"taxable income\") would be insufficiently defined. And again, the argument goes, you don't have to pay taxes.\n \n In short, you have to quote the entire Webster's dictionary to solve this imaginary problem.",

Consider: the rich can hire lawyers, split up companies into smaller sub companiese that fall under a lower bracket, and generally find more loopholes than the middle class. The government feels that it is not getting enough money (as some of you said) and raises taxes to compensate. Voila! The middle class loses more money! \n \n I for one am for a flat tax. Maybe make it a flat tax that only applies over a certain income bracket so it doesn't effect the poor as much. It would thin the manual and maybe force the government to look at its budget a little more critically.",

   "Actually, I worked this out one day in French when I was bored and creating my own little nation.\n \n At 50% of income on 1,000,000 dollars, the 5,000 people in my little nation making that much already paid 20 times as much in taxes as the 80,000 people at the $50,000 level. If they paid at 10% they would only pay about twice as much. \n \n Realize that 67% of income tax revenue comes from JUST the top 1%. 97% from the top 50%. Everyone else only pays 3% of the tax bill. So cutting everyone down to 10% leaves the IRS laying off most of its staff...\n \n And someone making $20,000 should never have to pay 10% of their income.

   "i know, my mother-in-law is a CPA.\n \n i just ish the tax changes were thiner than Webster's dictionary\n\n \n I know you already knew. ;) Your question in your previous post was a dead giveaway that you already knew the answer. My post was for the benefit for the other guy that his scamming ain't working. The definition angle is just one of several bogus arguments (http://www.quatloos.com/taxscams/taxprot.htm) that scammers like to use on the Internet.\n \n Now regarding the initial point of this thread, too many people like to pretend that income tax (local, state, federal) is the only tax that they pay. The reality is quite different from the story that they are trying to present.\n \n The truth is that people pay many different types of taxes and income tax is just one of them. Some of these \"taxes\" are often called \"fees\" like the recycling fee that some jurisdictions charge. In Maryland, there was a proposal for a \"surcharge\" just for flushing your toilet (dubbed the \"flush tax\"). There's the gasoline tax. There's the property tax. There's the sales tax. You have to add them all up. \n \n Different income brackets are affected quite differently from these taxes. For instance, if you earn 15k a year, drive 8,000 miles per year using a car with 22 mpg, you'd pay about $182 in gasoline taxes (assuming 50 cents per gallon gas tax). That's 1.21% of your income going to gas tax. Now if you make 85k, drive 18,000 miles, you'd pay $410 in gas tax. That's less than 0.5% of your income going to gas tax. So the richer guy, driving far more often, pays a less percentage of his income to gas tax than the poorer fellow.\n \n That's why you need to add up all the taxes to make a valid conclusion, not talk about one type of tax (income tax only) and make false conclusions.\n \n The question that must be asked is what percentage of your income actually goes to paying these collection of taxes?",
