   "The root cause of much income tax inequities is due to our progressive income tax rates. Progressive income tax rates' purpose is to promote a good and justifiable policy that we provide some tax relief for lower income earners. We simply didn't realize or appreciate the extent of mischief due to our choosing progressive income tax rates as the method to achieve that purpose.\n \n Each perceived or actual tax inequity induces a modification of our tax regulations; each of these remedies are in turn actual or perceived to be inequities to other factions that in turn lobby for still another regulating remedy. Our income tax regulations grow as a great onion under the ground; they're layers upon layers of additional inequities.\n \n Due to these additional tax inequities and loop holes the actual purpose of progressive rates, (to provide some tax relief for lower income earners) are severely undermined. Due to this and our FICA payroll tax are now the cause of our lower income wage earners being taxed much greater (than intended) proportions of their incomes.\n \n [Employers' portions of FICA serves similar to a sales tax except they additionally inhibit job creation. Due to this, FICA's an additional drag upon our nation's economy and particularly upon our median wage].\n \n There are simpler more effective and less intrusive methods that would better provide the intended tax relief for lower income earners. The problem is how to rid ourselves of the progressive income tax.\n \n Increasing lower income earner's tax rates is politically unfeasible. It would also be economically and socially detrimental. Favoring higher income earners with tax rate reductions would be politically unfeasible and increase the federal deficit.\n It would be more feasible to reform our income tax system if we decreased our dependence upon this overwhelming major source of federal revenue.\n \n I advocate that we should incrementally shift our revenue sources from income taxes to a sales tax. I believe that an acceptable rate of sales tax could not feasibly replace the entire revenue we derive from income taxes, (i.e. the \"fair tax\"). If I'm wrong, sales taxes will completely replace income taxes. If I'm correct, after some incremental step the sales tax rate will approach an unacceptable rate and the transfer of the tax sources will have to be interrupted.\n \n Respectfully, Supposn",

Here in the USA I believe our tax problems are due primarily to our tax policies.\n \n Respectfully, Supposn",
