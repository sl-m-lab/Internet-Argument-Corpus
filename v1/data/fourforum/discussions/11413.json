It is the agenda of the radical, all be it pathetic extreme left wing to attempt to align any violent attack to that of the conservative christian movement, even though this same article say's this, and shows that this guy is clearly anti-christian in his philosophy. In fact it is clear that he is as anti-christian in his beliefs as the very people on this forum who make the same exact claims about the truthfulness of the bible. And none of them are followers of Christ, just as this guy isn't.\n \n \nKaren Massey, a neighbor to Adkisson, told the Knoxville News Sentinel about a lengthy conversation she had with Adkisson a few years back in which she told him her daughter had just graduated from a bible college. She said she was surprised by his reaction when she told him she was a Christian.\n \n \"He almost turned angry,\" she told the newspaper. \"He seemed to get angry at that. He said that everything in the Bible contradicts itself if you read it.\" She also said Adkisson spoke frequently about his parents, who \"made him go to church all his life. ... He acted like he was forced to do that.\"\n\n \n He proves that when one reads the bible with the natural mind, he will see contradictions where none really exist.",
