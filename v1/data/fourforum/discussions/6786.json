They also need to be specifically debating ID, not creationism--I know, the Evolution advocates believe them to be the same thing, but the IDers don't so for analysis I need threads where it's voiced as ID, whether or not that is different from creationism.\n Thanks to anyone who can toss something my way.",

For the obvious problem of the designer \"letting\" species go extinct, see answer 3.\n I'm guessing that YEC/IDists will just point to the flood.\n And the conspiracy theorist/IDists will blame Satan for trying to mislead people.\n \n 5) Not a single one.

Some will claim that they \"have no reason\" to doubt common descent (a la Behe) but do a conspicuously good job of not saying they actually believe it.\n \n And if any IDists have a problem with my responses, they're able to post their own responses.
