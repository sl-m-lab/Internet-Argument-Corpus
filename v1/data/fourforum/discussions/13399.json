   "Conservative Bible Project Cuts Out Liberal Passages\n \nLo and behold, the Bible has gotten too liberal, according to a group of conservatives. And it needs a little editing. \n \n That's the inspiration behind the Conservative Bible Project, which seeks to take the text back to its supposed right-wing roots. \n \n Yes, even scripture is not orthodox enough for the modern conservative. Not that it's the fault of the author(s), exactly. The group cites a few reasons why the Bible is too progressive: \"Lack of precision in the original language ... lack of precision in modern language\" and \"translation bias in converting the original language to the modern one.\"\n \n So how can the Bible be conservatized? The group has proposed a Wikipedia-like group editing project. Some of the ideas would only bring the translation closer to the original. But others would fundamentally change the text. \n [*]Framework against Liberal Bias: providing a strong framework that enables a thought-for-thought translation without corruption by liberal bias [*]Not Emasculated: avoiding unisex, \"gender inclusive\" language, and other modern emasculation of Christianity[*]Not Dumbed Down: not dumbing down the reading level, or diluting the intellectual force and logic of Christianity; the NIV is written at only the 7th grade level[3][*]Utilize Powerful Conservative Terms: using powerful new conservative terms as they develop;[4] defective translations use the word \"comrade\" three times as often as \"volunteer\"; similarly, updating words which have a change in meaning, such as \"word\", \"peace\", and \"miracle\".[*]Combat Harmful Addiction: combating addiction by using modern terms for it, such as \"gamble\" rather than \"cast lots\";[5] using modern political terms, such as \"register\" rather than \"enroll\" for the census[*]Accept the Logic of Hell: applying logic with its full force and effect, as in not denying or downplaying the very real existence of Hell or the Devil.[*]Express Free Market Parables; explaining the numerous economic parables with their full free-market meaning[*]Exclude Later-Inserted Liberal Passages: excluding the later-inserted liberal passages that are not authentic, such as the adulteress story[*]Credit Open-Mindedness of Disciples: crediting open-mindedness, often found in youngsters like the eyewitnesses Mark and John, the authors of two of the Gospels[*]Prefer Conciseness over Liberal Wordiness: preferring conciseness to the liberal style of high word-to-substance ratio; avoid compound negatives and unnecessary ambiguities; prefer concise, consistent use of the word \"Lord\" rather than \"Jehovah\" or \"Yahweh\" or \"Lord God.\"Among the words to be eliminated: \"government.\" A conservative columnist at Beliefnet described the effort as \"just crazy ... like what you'd get if you crossed the Jesus Seminar with the College Republican chapter at a rural institution of Bible learnin'.\"\n",
