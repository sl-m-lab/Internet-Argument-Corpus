Bin Laden's plan to nail us financially has many facets, all very expensive.\n\n \n True enough. I was just noting on another thread (as you know, since you linked me here) that a prominent politician with a country home in my area is installing fortifications, including a moat. \n \n I have trouble understanding how people claim we are winning the war on terror, when Bin Ladens stated goal is to bleed us out financially, and he is doing such a superb job of it.",

The usual double standard in that promise applying to government, not the public. \n \n I recently visited a social security office in another small city to obtain a new SS card as laminated cards are no longer accepted by most government entities for second piece ID purposes. A small office, maybe six clerks and waiting room for 30 citizens. At the door seated behind a barrier was a uniformed, armed TSA guard asking if the person gaining entry had any firearm, knife or other dangerous weapon. When I left his agency station wagon was sitting in the parking lot. I was told his breaks and lunch periods were covered by a floating TSA guard who covered other federal agencies for the same purpose.\n \n Wonder what that costs us on a national basis of every SS office? Bin Laden has to feel very successful. We're doing exactly what he wants.",

Bin Laden has to feel very successful. We're doing exactly what he wants.\n\n \n Personally, I would like to see detailed homeland security budgets. It seems like federal buildings, even the little dump social security offices, are being protected in a fashion, but there are still only 9 customs guys to inspect the 21,000 containers that enter the free trade zone in kansas city each day. \n \n Lets not forget security at a state and local level, too. For the first time, we have sheriffs dep[uties around the clock at the courthouse. There is now a metal detector and an Xray machine there, too. There are also guards around the clock at the water treatment plant and the potable water inflow on the river (like Emporia, Ks is at the top of Bin Ladens hit list).",
