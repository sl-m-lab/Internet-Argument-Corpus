   "In a May 2003 issue of Planned Parenthood's Clergy Voices, Rabbi Balfour Brickner, an editor for the magazine, stated that \"...to make the fetus equivalent to a living, breathing human being is clearly unbiblical, un-Jewish, and if Christianity claims to be based on Biblical tradition, un-Christian. What makes all of these actions even harder to understand is that they emanate from [the presidential] administration whose leaders make a fetish out of their devotion to \"Christian religious values.\" Instead, they have demonstrated their ignorance or their willingness to ignore religious law.\"[1] Radical pro-abortionist Brickner used the biblical quote from Exodus 21:22, \"If men strive, and wound a pregnant woman so that her fruit be expelled, but no harm befalls her, then shall he be fined as her husband shall assess, and the matter placed before the judges.\"[2] He fails to see that biblically the fetus is human, and the evidence is found in both the new and old testaments. I even doubt he knows what a human is. \n \n In Pslams, we find several quotes about humanity in the womb. \"For thou didst form my inward parts: Thou didst cover me in my mother's womb... My frame was not hidden from thee, When I was made in secret, And curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth\".[3] In Pslam 22:10, we read \"I was cast upon thee from the womb; Thou art my God since my mother bare me\". In Gentiles we find \"when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me, even from my mother's womb, and called me through his grace,\"[4] The bible is filled with quotes about humanity in the womb, and clearly it would be a horrible crime to kill the humanity there. His quote in Exodus simply is stating that if a man gives his wife an abortion, he will be fined and God will judge him. In other words, it never said abortion was justified. \n \n Bricker stated that since \"...the unborn fetus is not considered a person, the one responsible cannot be held liable for the taking of human life and certainly not for murder\".[5] One cannot assert that personhood defines humanity. As a matter of fact, personhood never defines humanity. The definition of humanity is proven by biogenesis. Biogenesis states that all life comes from preexisting life, and all beings reproduce after their own kind. If the fetus isn't a human, what is it? It obviously cannot be a different being as the only possibility is that the fetus is human. By the fact that the fetus has a human genetic code, and by the Principle of Biogenesis, the fetus is human.\n \n Rabbi Bricker's assertion calling fetal humanity \"clearly unbiblical, un-Jewish, and if Christianity claims to be based on Biblical tradition, un-Christian\" is simply an attempt to attack the administration and gain Christian and Jewish minds. It is clear that the bible is against any killing of humanity, and that humanity includes the fetus. \n \n 1. http://www.plannedparenthood.org/clergy/#3\n 2.

   "As someone who does not believe that every word in the Bible is inspired, I&#8217;ll still debate the subject using the Bible verses. I&#8217;m not stating my belief about abortion in the following, just as I said, debating the verses.\n \n Exodus implies that a fetus is a piece of property that is owned by the husband. Notice the mother has no say in the matter, just the husband who decides the price of the fetus.\n \n The Psalms you quoted is not clear about the subject. It talks about God making the author, not about when he became a human being. And Psalms 22:10 implies that God was his God from the time he was born.\n \n I&#8217;m not sure where Gentiles is in the Bible but the verse you quoted again does not state when someone becomes a human being.\n \n The Bible is not filled with quotes about humanity in the womb.

It looks like what any human being would look like in that stage of development. Have you seen the movie The Elephant Man? It's a story of a man who had a bone disease that caused massive deformation (based on a true story). The man was forced into a circus, beaten, and made fun of becaue he didn't look like a human being. At the highest point of the movie, the Elephant Man is running away from a crowd of people who want to make fun of him and beat him; but he's trapped in an alley way.

Neither are humans in vegetative states. Neither are people in comas, the list goes on. \n\n \n I have no idea what you meant by \"Of course not\". If a human is in a vegetative state as in the sense of not having brain waves, then they are not a human being but are dead as defined by doctors today.

   " So does a sperm. I agree a sperm is human life, but do you consider a sperm as a human being?\n\n \n The problem is that the sperm has the father's DNA. The fetus doesn't. The fetus has it's own DNA, it's blueprint. \n \n \n Are you daft? I never said a word about what the fetus looked like. I said I believed a fetus was not a human being until it was able to think and that required brain waves. What part of that sentence made you think I was talking about what something looked like? And you want to lecture me on the English language?\n\n \n Yes, but part of your argument was \"I cannot compare a few cells with my children and come up with the same living being\". Hence, you started it. :-D\n \n \n Well it starts out as a zygote, then an embryo, then a fetus. It's a group of cells that will develop into a baby under the right circumstances. I don't know what you are looking for. Just because you already know this doesn't mean that's not what it is. Of course it's alive. It's attached to the mother. In the context of what we are talking about it is a potential human being.\n\n \n It has a lot to do with it. You can't seem to define what the fetus is. Obviously the fetus has to be something. If it's alive and independent from the mother, the fetus is something. Is it its own species? Everything that's alive is part of a species. Is it part of the human species? But then it's now human. What is it?\n \n \n Since I don't know what you mean by personhood, I can't answer or even say that personhood does define life.\n\n \n Personhood is having a personality; being able to think. The early fetus is not a person because it cannot think. But personhood does not define humanity. Humanity defines humanity. \n \n \n I have no idea what you meant by \"Of course not\". If a human is in a vegetative state as in the sense of not having brain waves, then they are not a human being but are dead as defined by doctors today.\n\n \n That's not true. Doctors CANNOT consider people in vegetative states dead, they consider them brain dead. As a matter of fact, many doctors have suffered law suits about the issue. Don't you remember the case that happened last week in Florida? At any rate, we are getting somewhere. Allow me to present an issue I've presented to people in the past. There is a man named Way. Last Christmas, Way went skiing and crashed into a tree. After a few months of being in a coma, he fell into a vegetative state, and went brain dead. He only was alive due to life support. However, in very rare case, he began to recover. Slowly but surely his brainwaves began to recover and there was a chance of partial recovery. If you knew of this chance before the man was brain dead, would you kill him? \n \n The answer is quite obvious; no. Why? Because if a man is that willing to survive that somehow his brainwaves would reappear, he has every right to life. The same goes for the fetus; it has every right to live. It is a potential person, and definitely a human. The difference between a fetus and a person in a vegetative state is that the fetus is growing into a person, while the person who is brain dead generally does not have a chance to recover. \n \n \n People that are in comas with no brain damage are just as much a human being as you are. They are just not responding to outside stimuli, like when someone is asleep. The dividing line is brain waves.\n\n \n Many people in comas are brain dead as well. But are they not human? Of course not. Although I would probably allow them to die, the difference between them and a fetus is that fetuses will eventually have brainwaves, and have personalities, these people will not. \n \n \n You think that when I simply say the science does not define a human being, that is being dramatic? You've been working with too much glue. LOL What in the world does you stating that you don't believe I am a human have to do with whether science defines human being not? I know that science defines human life, I'm talking about a human being.\n\n \n What's your definition for the two (human life and human being), besides the obvious. \n \n \n Don't be a smartass. I never said it was part of the mother, I said it was not independent of the mother without advanced medical intervention. Do I need to provide you with the definition of independent?\n\n \n I'm not being a smartass, I'm really curious in knowing what you're thinking. \n \n \n Well knock me over with a feather. People that don't want the church running their lives. You would think these people lived in the United States.\n\n \n Don't be a XXXXX.

   "The problem is that the sperm has the father's DNA. The fetus doesn't. The fetus has it's own DNA, it's blueprint. \n\n \n Do you ever read what I say or even what you say or are you just slow? You gave three conditions for being human life. The sperm meets all three conditions. The fact that the sperm has the father's DNA does not for a second change the fact that it has human DNA, your requirement, not mine. Now do you want to change your requirements for human life or do you want to say that the father's DNA is not human. Otherwise a sperm meets the requirements for human life according to your definition.\n \n \nYes, but part of your argument was \"I cannot compare a few cells with my children and come up with the same living being\". Hence, you started it. :-D \n\n \n Yes and the very next sentence was \"For starters a zygote has no senses and can not think.\" Now I ask you again, where did I compare what they looked like. You pulled that right out of the air because you needed to try and make a point and you can't follow a debate.\n \n \nIt has a lot to do with it. You can't seem to define what the fetus is. Obviously the fetus has to be something. If it's alive and independent from the mother, the fetus is something. Is it its own species? Everything that's alive is part of a species. Is it part of the human species? But then it's now human. What is it? \n\n \n fetus: an unborn or unhatched vertebrate especially after attaining the basic structural plan of its kind; specifically : a developing human from usually three months after conception to birth.\n \n From the Merriam-Webster dictionary. Happy now?\n \n \nPersonhood is having a personality; being able to think. The early fetus is not a person because it cannot think. But personhood does not define humanity. Humanity defines humanity. \n\n It's stupid to say that something defines itself. Like saying a car defines a car. Based on the definition I gave above from the dictionary, I believe a fetus can think and is a person which is a human being. I don't know what you mean when you talk about humanity and a person being different. But I believe that before brain waves develop, the embryo is neither a person nor a human.\n \nThat's not true. Doctors CANNOT consider people in vegetative states dead, they consider them brain dead. As a matter of fact, many doctors have suffered law suits about the issue. Don't you remember the case that happened last week in Florida? At any rate, we are getting somewhere. Allow me to present an issue I've presented to people in the past. There is a man named Way. Last Christmas, Way went skiing and crashed into a tree. After a few months of being in a coma, he fell into a vegetative state, and went brain dead. He only was alive due to life support. However, in very rare case, he began to recover. Slowly but surely his brainwaves began to recover and there was a chance of partial recovery. If you knew of this chance before the man was brain dead, would you kill him? \n \n The answer is quite obvious; no. Why? Because if a man is that willing to survive that somehow his brainwaves would reappear, he has every right to life. The same goes for the fetus; it has every right to live. It is a potential person, and definitely a human. The difference between a fetus and a person in a vegetative state is that the fetus is growing into a person, while the person who is brain dead generally does not have a chance to recover. \n\n \n The case last week in Florida has nothing to do with being brain dead. I am referring to being brain dead in the medical sense. For that, there are several test that must be done in addition to checking for a lack of brain waves. They include no pupil dilation, no blinking when the eyes are touched, no reactions when warm water is placed in the ear, no movement of the eyes when the head is moved and a few others that convince doctors that the patient is beyond hope of recovery. I have never heard of someone recovering from that. However if you know of a case I'm sure it would be written up in a medical journal and I would be interested in reading about it.\n \n I believe that once brain waves start, the fetus has a right to live. Before that, then I don't believe so.\n \n If I knew someone had a chance of recovery I would not want him killed. Unless of course he was on life support and had asked not to be kept on life support ahead of time. However since you started the what if game, I have a question for you. If you knew before hand that a person would die and go to hell, would you recommend an abortion to prevent this soul from eternal torture? \n \n \nMany people in comas are brain dead as well. But are they not human? Of course not. Although I would probably allow them to die, the difference between them and a fetus is that fetuses will eventually have brainwaves, and have personalities, these people will not. \n\n \n If they are brain dead, I don't believe they call it a coma. Just as they don't say dead people are in a coma.\n \n \nWhat's your definition for the two (human life and human being), besides the obvious. \n\n \n I'm having a hard time with your human life and human being concept. But I believe there is a physical and a spiritual part of man. I believe that there is no human being until the soul enters the body, which I believe occurs at the beginning of brain waves, and that the soul leaves the body at what we call brain death.\n \n \nI'm not being a smartass, I'm really curious in knowing what you're thinking. \n\n \n Not sure I can make it any clearer. \n \n \nDon't be a XXXXX. If they decide to go to a Catholic school they have to follow the rules. One of the rules is no use of contraceptives.\n\n \n Well obviously they don't HAVE to follow the rules as you stated that you \"tried\" to stop college students from taking them. Maybe they go there because they are Catholics and want an education but don't follow every single rule.\n \n You can't even follow a debate as I'm clearly shown above. And you call me a XXXXX. I'm beginning to think you are the one that is brain dead? LOL\n \n Do you believe in evolution?",

An Arm is human life. My hair is human life. But none of them alone are the human being. Am I correct? The conditions for human beings are to first of all be alive, be biologically human, and to be independent. The fetus is alive, biologically human, and independent.

You know what you meant.\n \n [quote] From the Merriam-Webster dictionary. Happy now?quote]\n \n No, not at all. It doesn't say anything about it's humanity, so your source remains unanswered. I am a developing human, and a developing vertebrate. Obviously, the dictionary isn't going to say \"It's a little human being\", because it's such a controversial issue. Once again, I ask you: If the fetus is ALIVE, and INDEPDENDENT, what species is it part of? The only possibility is that it's part of the human species. If it's HUMAN, ALIVE, and INDEPDENT, it is a human being. The argument is sound. \n \n \n It's stupid to say that something defines itself. [1] Like saying a car defines a car.

I don't know what you mean when you talk about humanity and a person being different. [2] But I believe that before brain waves develop, the embryo is neither a person nor a human.\n\n \n A car does define a car. The car is made of steel, uses gasoline, and drives people around. That is how we know a car is a car. I suppose I should rephrase; biological human traits define humanity. However, neither \"brainwaves\" or personhood define humanity- that's separate. \n \n \n The case last week in Florida has nothing to do with being brain dead.

At the same time, this fictional version happens all the time with embryos. They are \"recovering\" patients. \n \n \n I believe that once brain waves start, the fetus has a right to live. Before that, then I don't believe so.\n\n \n Why? Since when does having brainwaves define humanity and right to life? Because it doesn't know it exists? Because it wont feel anything? Look at that woman from Florida. She was going to recover, although at her current state she was pretty close to being brain dead; she didn't know she was alive, she probably felt no pain, et cetera. The only things keeping her alive were the necessities. However, she would recover. Picture the fetus as recovering mentally. Doctors can never kill a recovering patient, can they? \n \n \n If you knew before hand that a person would die and go to hell, would you recommend an abortion to prevent this soul from eternal torture?\n\n \n Yes, if I was absolutely sure and there was no chance of falling back. Why wouldn't I?\n \n \n I'm having a hard time with your human life and human being concept. But I believe there is a physical and a spiritual part of man. I believe that there is no human being until the soul enters the body, which I believe occurs at the beginning of brain waves, and that the soul leaves the body at what we call brain death.\n\n \n Um, okay.

What you mean is the fetus is different from the mother or father, not independent. The sperm is certainly not dependent on the father as it can live quite well without the help of the father or his body. But it actually is also different since it only has one-half the chromosomes the father has. So it won&#8217;t match the father&#8217;s DNA at all. However it will match one-half the father&#8217;s DNA. Just like the zygote's DNA will match one-half the father&#8217;s DNA and one-half the mother&#8217;s DNA. \n \n \nRidiculous.

The point of my DNA argument isn't to say that the fetus has DNA; the point is that the fetus is biologically independent from the mother. The sperm is part of the father; no question about it. The sperm is carrying part of the father, and combining with part of the mother, creating the fetus. Even though it's only having of the genetic characteristics, it's still part of the father, scientifically speaking. Your argument can also say that an infant is part of the mother; but that's obviously not true. \n \n \n Yep I see you are using that mind-boggling logic again. Like when I look up \"car\" in the dictionary, it gives \"a car\" as the definition. LOL\n\n \n You're way off base. It's obvious that a car defines a car. A person defines a person. A cat defines a cat. However, people are trying to say that personhood defines humanity, and that is a logical fallacy. The fetus is a human life because it is biologically, not because it's a person. \n \n \n Do you know what \"fiction\" means. It means not true which is exactly what you have stated, not true. How does an embryo \"recover\" brain waves when it never had brain waves to begin with?\n\n \n LOL! Of course I know what fiction is! This is mere proof of your incoherence! And further proof is your next statement made in bold. LOL. You are completely missing the point.\n \n Perhaps I should explain. The fetus is human by the characteristics of human biology. Naturally these characteristics bring fourth a personality, but only by biology. Because the fetus will eventually gain a brain, the fetus must be protected. It is human; it is alive; it is it's own being. It has just as much of a right to life as you and I. Further, the only reason why we have a personality is because of biology. Hence, personhood does not define humanity. The mere biological definitions of humanity do. This is the reason why I say \"Humanity defines humanity\". Just as dogs define dogs, cats define cats, humanity defines humanity. Understand?\n \n \n I didn't say having brainwaves define a human being. I said I believed it defined a human being because I believe that is when the soul enters the body. And my belief is just as good as yours or anyone's because it's something that can not be proved.\n\n \n It is proved by science.

As there is no scientific evidence to support your argument.\n\n \n Hahahaha. And what have I been discussing the past few posts? Perhaps I should specify. In every biology book, the definition of humanity is genetically being part of the Homo sapiens species. The fetus is part of the Homo sapiens species. Secondly, the person must be alive. The fetus follows the biological criteria for life; it metabolizes reproduces (reproduces cells), grows, and stimulates. Finally, the fetus is not part of the mother. Hence, the fetus is, biologically, a human being. In its early age it may not be a person, but it is still human and entitled to all the rights and privileges humanity gives us. \n \n \n Hey you were the one that implied they were breaking the rules and you couldn't stop them. So I'll say again, apparently you don't have to follow the rules as they were breaking the rules. Why don't the schools kick them out? Had they rather have their money?\n\n \n They have, and they also legislated student rights. That's why it was so controversial. \n \n [quote] Now that was funny.

I find it amusing that you continue to make remarks about me insulting you, yet you started the insults and don't seem to see that as relevant. It appears you only see one side of the debate. Much like you say your argument is scientific and logical and my side is not although you don't present any evidence. You just state something as a fact. I'd bet you are in a position where you are not accustomed to being questioned. Am I correct?\n \n \nThat's far from the point.\n \n \n No it's not\n \n \nThe point of my DNA argument isn't to say that the fetus has DNA; the point is that the fetus is biologically independent from the mother. \n\n \n I know exactly what your point is. I just disagree. The fetus is not biologically independent from the mother. If you take the fetus out of the mother, it dies. That's about as dependent as you can get. The fetus is different from the mother though.\n \n \n The sperm is part of the father; no question about it.

Your argument can also say that an infant is part of the mother; but that's obviously not true.\n\n \n You are just making statements here. There is nothing scientific about anything you have said. It's ridicules to say that the sperm is part of the father since it has half the DNA of the father, then turn right around and say that the zygote is not part of the father since it also has half the DNA of the father. The same argument applies to both.\n \n \nYou're way off base. It's obvious that a car defines a car. A person defines a person. A cat defines a cat. However, people are trying to say that personhood defines humanity, and that is a logical fallacy. The fetus is a human life because it is biologically, not because it's a person. \n\n \n And just why am I way off base? Because you say so? LOL. The zygote does not define a person any more than a lug nut defines a car. \n \n \nLOL! Of course I know what fiction is! This is mere proof of your incoherence! And further proof is your next statement made in bold. LOL. You are completely missing the point. \n\n \n See there you go with the insults again. So you want me to stop but you want to continue right along. Sorry, it doesn't work that way. So does fiction mean something is not true?\n \n What part of the sentence in bold is not true?\n \n \nPerhaps I should explain. The fetus is human by the characteristics of human biology. Naturally these characteristics bring fourth a personality, but only by biology. Because the fetus will eventually gain a brain, the fetus must be protected. It is human; it is alive; it is it's own being. It has just as much of a right to life as you and I. Further, the only reason why we have a personality is because of biology. Hence, personhood does not define humanity. The mere biological definitions of humanity do. This is the reason why I say \"Humanity defines humanity\". Just as dogs define dogs, cats define cats, humanity defines humanity. Understand? \n\n \n You are just repeating the same thing over and over. I understand perfectly what you are saying, I just don't agree with you and think you are wrong. There is a difference between something being human like a sperm from a human, and a human being.\n \n \nIt is proved by science. The mere definitions of humanity tell us that even the zygote is human.\n\n \n If you are going to use science to say the zygote is human, then the sperm is human also. Neither are human beings.\n \n \nI don't know. I don't even know if there are people in hell. \n\n \n That's interesting. I was under the impression that you are catholic and that Catholic's believed in the wide path to destruction, narrow path to salvation concept. Am I incorrect in thinking that?\n \n \nHahahaha. And what have I been discussing the past few posts? Perhaps I should specify. In every biology book, the definition of humanity is genetically being part of the Homo sapiens species. The fetus is part of the Homo sapiens species. Secondly, the person must be alive. The fetus follows the biological criteria for life; it metabolizes reproduces (reproduces cells), grows, and stimulates. Finally, the fetus is not part of the mother. Hence, the fetus is, biologically, a human being. In its early age it may not be a person, but it is still human and entitled to all the rights and privileges humanity gives us.\n\n \n I'm not debating with you about the zygote having human DNA or being human in the sense you mean. I'm saying I don't believe a zygote is a human being because it does not have human being qualities such as thinking. I did a little search using biology and human and everything I came up with talked about personality and social interaction. I didn't see anything about zygotes being human.\n \n \n \nThey have, and they also legislated student rights. That's why it was so controversial. \n\n \n Okay\n \nHey, I like talking to potatoes. They comfort me. \n\n Then we're good for each other. I like talking to people that are easily tripped up and made to look foolish. LOL\n \n \nYes. Adam and Eve were the first genetic humans. The big bang was God creating light, et cetera, infinitum, saecula saeculorum.\n\n \n I think we might think along the same lines. If you substitute first genetic humans with first animals with a soul, that would be my beliefs.\n \n Do you think God physically changed the genetics of humans to make them different? Was there a species of animals that he changed all of them into humans or did he create them from nothing?",

I didn't get back until Saturday evening, was in a hangover (not really), so I'm here now :-)\n \n Firstly the fetus is biologically independent. It has a different genetic code from the parents, so hence it is not part of them. The late fetus (which you constitute as human) also is independent, and so is the infant. \n \n Secondly, the fetus has a full genetic structure (and sometimes extra chromosomes!). The sperm only has half a genetic structure. The fetus is able to reproduce (non-sexually, like the infant). The sperm in itself cannot. Hence, although the sperm is alive, it is not human.\n \n \n And just why am I way off base? Because you say so? LOL. The zygote does not define a person any more than a lug nut defines a car.\n\n \n You're way off base because you're way off base, not because I said so. The zygote does not define a person. I'm not arguing that. However, you're saying that personhood defines humanity, when that isn't so. \n \n \n You are just repeating the same thing over and over. I understand perfectly what you are saying, I just don't agree with you and think you are wrong. There is a difference between something being human like a sperm from a human, and a human being.\n\n \n The difference has nothing to do with being a person. Personhood never defines humanity. \n \n \n If you are going to use science to say the zygote is human, then the sperm is human also. Neither are human beings.\n\n \n No, because the sperm lacks chromosomes. It only has half of the human DNA, which makes it a NON-human.  For a better explaination, here's a good article written by the man who discovered that Down's Syndome was when humans have an extra chromosome.\n \n \n That's interesting. I was under the impression that you are catholic and that Catholic's believed in the wide path to destruction, narrow path to salvation concept. Am I incorrect in thinking that?\n\n \n Catholics believe that a hell exists and the only way to salvation is by the influence of the Church. However, we have no way in knowing that people are in hell.\n \n \n I'm not debating with you about the zygote having human DNA or being human in the sense you mean. I'm saying I don't believe a zygote is a human being because it does not have human being qualities such as thinking. I did a little search using biology and human and everything I came up with talked about personality and social interaction. I didn't see anything about zygotes being human.\n\n \n Because you searched online? An infant doesn't have all the human qualities; it cannot reproduce. Does that make it a non-human? Of course not. Give it time, and it will reproduce. Remember, personhood does not define humanity! The zygote is a human being bioligcally. If you open a biology book, and look up \"Criteria for Life\" it will say something like \"Metabolism, Reproduction, Growth, and Stimuli\" and may add something or another. It's a fact, not an opinion. As for being human, it has a full DNA code, so it is part of the human species, and finally it is independent from the mother.
