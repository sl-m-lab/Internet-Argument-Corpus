   "Poet,\n \n \"Homosexual people are not another \"race\", so why would you be given any more rights than anyone else?\"\n \n - Exactly... Gays of course don't deserve any mroe rights or better treatment than others but they do deserve equal treatment.\n \n \" You can not be discriminated against for employment, promotions, buying a house, etc.\"\n \n - Of course there is alot of discrimination fro employment and promotions.

Perhaps its a combination of both. Regardless lets assume it is a choice.

Or do you say that heterosexuality IS genetic? If so, why couldn't homosexuality be genetic?\n\n \n OK, that statement made absolutely no sense. Yes, heterosexuality is genetic, because it is the WAY WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE!!! And I never said homosexuality couldn't be genetic, I said IT IS NOT GENETIC!\n \n Sorry for the yelling, but this is aggravating. If I am correct in my point that homosexuality is completely environmental, then I grant that if a child is brought up in an environment that will have such an impact on that child that he or she becomes homosexual, then that child had little or no choice. But, just like all other problems men and women face in this world, this one can be overcome. It becomes a choice once that person gets into adulthood and doesn't have the choice of falling back on excuses. People need to have some self-responsibilty for what they are. \n \n My father left when I was pretty young. He came back, and ther family was healed right before I left for the Army, but the damage was done to me. I rebelled and did some really screwed up stuff as a kid and young adult in the Army. I got into some pretty serious trouble. I know that I did much of what I did because of my father leaving the family. And even though I still bear scars and feel hatred for my dad at times, I don't blame him for what I did. I made a choice. I came back from those choices and am now successful with a wonderful family.\n \n Homosexuals also have a choice. What the genetics argument does is make people think that they can't help what they are, so they have an excuse. What the APA does is take homosexuality off their \"mental disease\" list because of political pressure and make homosexuality legitimate. It is all just so dishonest.",

   "I believe that the homosexual lifestyle is detremental to society because it promotes morals that are counter to the best interests of society. AIDS would not be at the level it is today if not for the homosexual lifestyle.\n\n \n AIDS would also not be at the level it is today if it wasn't for the entire continent of Africa. Along with homosexuals, blacks are also disproportionately infected with AIDS. Thus, integration is detrimental to society.\n \n \n \n\n In my experience, most homosexuals are promiscuous\n \n\n \n Actually, most males are naturally more promiscuous. So when you have a relationship made up of two guys, well... Not surprisingly, lesbians are statistically the least promiscuous group.\n \n I wouldn't argue that homosexuals are more liberal, and that could lead them to be more promiscuous, though. But that doesn't account for lesbians.\n \n \n\n There is no evidence that homosexuality is genetic. No gene has been found that makes a person homosexual.\n \n\n \n More accurately, they haven't found a single gene that will definitively determine someone's orientation. There has been, however, plenty of research that suggests homosexuality has biological origins in other areas. There's also one theory that the \"gene\" for homosexuality could simply be a trigger. For instance, people with certain inherited diseases passed down to them are not necessarily infected by them. The mother/father actually just passes down a trigger for the disease, which has whatever percentage chance of being set off. One person, then, could become infected if his is triggered, while his identical twin could possibly not. There are more technical words for this theory, I just forgot them and I don't have the reference in front of me. Anyway, I'm going into more detail about the possible biological origins in response to your query on the \"Gay High School\" thread.\n \n \n \n\n And I never said homosexuality couldn't be genetic, I said IT IS NOT GENETIC!\n \n Sorry for the yelling, but this is aggravating. \n \n People need to have some self-responsibilty for what they are.\n \n Homosexuals also have a choice.\n \n What the APA does is take homosexuality off their \"mental disease\" list because of political pressure and make homosexuality legitimate.\n\n \n Keep in mind this might be aggravating for the other side as well. You seem to be making a lot of absolute, blanket statements. This is particularly distressing because there are millions of very educated people out there with MDs and PhDs who refuse to make a definitive statement on the origins of homosexuality because they are still unknown. These are people who have spent their entire lives working in the fields of biology and psychology, who base their opinions on exhaustive research rather than mere intuition. Yet you're dismissing all this research with an unbased fact claim and a lecture on politics and honesty. Oddly enough, even those scientists who believe homosexuality is a choice (and yes, they are a clear minority in the scientific community) refuse to claim their opinions as fact.\n \n Like I said, I've gone into much greater detail about all the biological evidence of homosexuality in the other thread. Take a moment, but please note how absolutely NONE of the cited authors are claiming to know anything as a fact. I can't stress this enough. The reason all this is still a debate is exactly because no one knows what the origins of homosexuality are, including you. However, the evidence out there is seems to promote one side over the other. I'm only stating that the research that exists suggests a biological origin, or a combination biological-environmental origin. Thus not a choice.",

   "There is no evidence that homosexuality is genetic. No gene has been found that makes a person homosexual.\n \n \n \n \n OK, that statement made absolutely no sense. Yes, heterosexuality is genetic, because it is the WAY WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE!!! And I never said homosexuality couldn't be genetic, I said IT IS NOT GENETIC!\n \n Sorry for the yelling, but this is aggravating. If I am correct in my point that homosexuality is completely environmental, then I grant that if a child is brought up in an environment that will have such an impact on that child that he or she becomes homosexual, then that child had little or no choice. But, just like all other problems men and women face in this world, this one can be overcome. It becomes a choice once that person gets into adulthood and doesn't have the choice of falling back on excuses. People need to have some self-responsibilty for what they are. \n \n My father left when I was pretty young. He came back, and ther family was healed right before I left for the Army, but the damage was done to me. I rebelled and did some really screwed up stuff as a kid and young adult in the Army. I got into some pretty serious trouble. I know that I did much of what I did because of my father leaving the family. And even though I still bear scars and feel hatred for my dad at times, I don't blame him for what I did. I made a choice. I came back from those choices and am now successful with a wonderful family.\n \n Homosexuals also have a choice. What the genetics argument does is make people think that they can't help what they are, so they have an excuse. What the APA does is take homosexuality off their \"mental disease\" list because of political pressure and make homosexuality legitimate. It is all just so dishonest.\n\n \n Actually, I never said that I  believed it was genetic. I honestly don't know...and I never said that it was proven either. I just know that they are and have been doing studies to determine whether it is or not. But if there is ABSOLUTELY NO WAY that it is genetic, they would know by now and wouldn't be studying it, and there would be no debate about it.\n Do you have any research that you can share with everyone that proves that it ISN'T genetic?? The reason I said that about heterosexuality was to make a point... it is the way we are supposed to be according to you... maybe homosexuals believe that is the way they are supposed to be... \n I agree that environmental issues are a factor... but if it isn't genetic at all, where did homosexuality come from? If it is all environmental, something had to create that environment. \n And yell all you want... that's what it's all about and if that's how you want to get your point across, go for it... doesn't hurt me any... but it's aggravating to BOTH sides because people don't agree... that's why it's a debate.",

   "WarriorPoet,\n \n Affirmative action is a different debate. For the record, I don't agree with it, and the \"in your face\" kind of gay rights marching/protesting/whatever irritates me too. But like dsadevil said, special privileges are different from equal treatment. Marrying, adopting, inheritence, job discrimination protection, and health insurance, to name a few, are not special privileges. Everyone else has those rights, gay people do not.\n \n The choice argument is also very distracting... I tend to get absorbed by it and forget a very important thing: Choice is only relevant in the religious debate over homosexuality (and even then, sometimes it's not). As far as government and law goes, personal preferences are clearly protected.\n \n I would agree that if Sally came out with proof that homosexuality is a choice, her research would be heavily criticized and closely scrutinized. On the flip side of the coin, though, it would be accepted almost immediately by half the population with only a cursory glance. Still, it's a scenario I have a hard time imagining.. There's a reason that denial's such a major stage for almost everyone who is homosexual. Why would someone choose a lifestyle that so many people still don't accept? And if they did choose it, why would they deny it for years and pretend it doesn't exist?",

   "Whats Bush actually doing or saying? To me, if Bush wants to mix Religion and Politics he's even more of a XXXXX then i thought and he should resign.\n \n As much as i liked America when i was younger and wanted to live there (I'm from the UK) when i got older i realised what a bad decision it would be. America is severly religious. Now, some of you may think thats all thooper and shtuffs but its not. Especially when the Religion is Christianity...one of the more...nastier, vindictive Religions. Can't you all just be Buddhists? Be peaceful and not try and be in peoples faces?\n \n Anyway, in England Homosexuality has been proven to be natural. Studies on Homosexual animals (both wild and not so wild) have been carried out. Sheep, for instance, that show Homosexual traits (attempting to mate with the same sex, not being interested in females, having pink wool, bleating rather camply) were studied and when they died had an autopsy done on their brain. This showed that the Sheep had more female Hormones in its brain.\n \n Other such tests were carried out on animals by injecting pregnant animals with Eoestrogen (i think that was the hormone) and the results showed that the foetus inside either became Transgendered or Gay.\n \n Now, in some cases people may choose to be Homosexual, but those cases are few and far between and can actually be counted on one hand. In any case, who would choose to be Homosexual? Not far back i was laughed at (by a group of stupid, football shirt wearing, Hetero's) because i acknowledged i was Gay. In America Gays get a rough time, what with the Christian Freedom Fighters and all.\n \n Anyway, to digress and go upto my point about Christians being vindictive and nasty, i only say this because of - \n \n 1) How they treat Gays...\n 2) How they treat Transexuals and Transgendereds...",

   "maybe i was wrong, but i was always led to believe that in america, there was a separation of church and state. \n \n if it is religion and tradition that is saying that homosexuality is wrong, why should that carry over into law?\n \n this brings up the whole controversy over civil union vs. religious marriage. \n civil unions, however, have a lower legal status than a legal marriage. thankfully, people are working to change that. there are people trying to make homosexual marriages legal. only legal marriages though, not necessarily religious ones. however, with bush in the office who knows if it will work or not. can you believe that he signed the law on abortion without one woman in the room?!\n and people say that by allowing religious homosexual marriages, that we're contradicting the religion and blah blah blah. but that still doesn't mean it should be law. it should be up to each religious insitution to allow marriages in them.\n \n that was one of the good things about america. that everyone had an equal chance, an equal opportunity. but by denying homosexuals equal rights... what the hell is that? that's not equal that's not a right. that's denying a minority of people their civil liberties, that this country was created to protect. whether it's a \"sin\" or not, shouldn't matter. if it's a \"sin\" to a christian, well then they just shouldn't participate in it. like abortion. if you dont like it, don't have one. \n \n except homosexuality should even be more accepted than abortion, because there isn't any controversy over taking a life. it's just different. i really don't understand why there's such a problem with it.\n \n if you allow legal marriages though, from what people have said, it raises the question of where do you draw the line? WHAT LINE NEEDS TO BE DRAWN? i've heard people bringing up \"well i dont want homosexuals thinking they can look at me\" or \"they shouldn't be allowed in the military\" -- what a bunch of XXXX. i think it's insulting to assume that because they're attracted to members of the same sex they're attracted to all members. or that if they're near the members of their sex that's all they'll think about, even if they're in a job or war type situation. it's ridiculous. \n \n this whole thing is ridiculous.",
