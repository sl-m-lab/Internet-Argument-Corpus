I guess they imploded at one point but . . .\n \n Actually, what DO we know about black holes?\n \n We kinda think they exist, right?\n\n \n Black holes are formed when a massive star reaches the point when its fuel for fusion has run out. This happens when most of the core is made of iron. \n When fusion stops, there is no enormous heat being generated to counter the star's enormous gravity so it collapses upon itself.\n As the star becomes smaller and smaller, denser and denser, its gravity increases and warps the space around it more and more. Eventually the gravity is so strong that light itself cannot escape and the event horizon forms, inside which all the matter that was the star collapses into a single infinitely small point, the singularity.\n Actually, it's not all the matter because only the core collapses, the rest explodes outwards in a supernova. The final stage of this colossal event takes place in a fraction of a second! \n A black hole would also be formed if enough matter is squeezed into a tiny enough space, but the only way nature does it is stellar collapse. For example, if we could squeeze the sun down to 3km wide (from 1.4m km) it would become a black hole, but it's not massive enough to do this naturally and will only become a white dwarf, a pale imitation of its present glory.\n We can detect black holes (or whatever they are, Hawking's theories are only the best theory we have for describing these real but weird objects) in three ways:\n \n 1) Stars that seem to be orbiting a space where there is no visible matter\n \n 2) Gravitational lensing, where the light from objects further behind the black hole is bent around it producing multiple images of the object\n \n 3) The light from the accretion disk; matter falling into a black hole which becomes very energetic (hence light-emitting) due to the extreme acceleration it undergoes as it falls towards the event horizon. Sometimes we even see high-energy \"jets\" of particles spewing out along the axis of the accretion disk at near-lightspeed! \n \n OK, this is where it gets really weird, and I quote straight from Wikipedia:\n \n \n\n Objects in a gravitational field experience a slowing down of time, called time dilation. This phenomenon has been verified experimentally in the Scout rocket experiment of 1976 [6], and is, for example, taken into account in the GPS system. Near the event horizon, the time dilation increases rapidly. From the point of view of an external observer, it takes an infinite amount of time for an object to approach the event horizon, at which point the light coming from it is infinitely red-shifted. To the distant observer, the object, falling slower and slower, approaches but never reaches the event horizon. However, the object itself might not even notice the point at which it crosses the event horizon, and will do so in a finite amount of proper time....\n \n\n \n And, as has already been mentioned, black holes do decay via \"Hawking radiation\" although I have never understood how this radiation escapes, as light (and seemingly therefore anything else) cannot.\n Eventually, according to Hawking, the black hole gets really small, decays faster and vanishes in a burst of radiation. This process takes hundreds of times longer than the current age of the universe!\n \n There's even more about primordial black holes, micro-black holes, supermassive black holes that lurk in the center of every galaxy....what I love about it is that because we can't see them, all of this has been worked out by nutters like Hawking doing genius maths in their heads!\n \n Sorry to go on about this at such length but basically I find it fascinating!",
