More particularly I was intrigued by the correspondence to the socialist notion that laws can increase freedom, as can taxation. Presumably Christian conservatives agree with the former, but deny the latter. Why is this?",

   "The US's situation where \"liberals\" support higher taxes is unique and a historical oddity. \n \n The combination of the enforcement of morality, both at home and abroad, and the support of a relatively free market is unnatural and unsustainable in the long term. (Enforcement costs money, money means taxes, and taxes mean \"social\" programs to encourage the people to accept the taxes). \n \n With King George the second's regime being the most anti-competitive overbearing American government in recent memory, we may be witnessing the end of this unlikely combination, which appears to have been sparked, in the first case, through the presence of the USSR and the mutual desire for many of those devoted to the US's power in the world or the free market to seek an alliance.\n \n It's up to the \"liberals\" in America to realign their views too, as the neocons have done, and recognise the incompatability both of economic freedom and social oppression, and of economic oppression and social freedom. Social programs engender moral hazards which consequently ferment a desire in the public for social oppression.\n \n The present political situation in the US is unstable, the Republicans have shown which direction they are moving, it is up to the Democrats to do the same.",
