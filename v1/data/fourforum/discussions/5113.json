   "We believe Japan could learn more from Germany regarding attitudes towards history in a bid to improve ties with Asia countries.\n Above all, as German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said, facing up to wartime past could help you win more friends instead of insulting yourself.\n Meanwhile, Japan should back up its latest remorse over WWII with actions by drafting relevant laws to curb right-wing ideology in the country, just as Germany has done.\n in a word, Germany serves as a mirror for Japan to reflect upon its stance on history.",

   "More than 6,000 Japanese have held a rally in Tokyo to object a controversial history textbook and an envisaged move to revise the current education law.\n Participants from hundreds of civilian groups gathered at the Yoyogi Park on Saturday, calling to boycott the revised textbook which glorifies Japan's colonial rule and war-time ravage in Asia. \n After all, there are many ordinary Japanese who could envisage the history and be honeset and upright. \n The Japanese government should learn from its people and make a right stance as soon as possible.",

   "Japan are always hesistated to face their wrongdoings in the past.In the same position, Germany, also an invador in WWII, are always ready to regret for what they did in the past and have done a lot for their victim countries. In return, this won world-wide recognization and respect for Germany.Japanese people are hard to understand that just for the nation's respect and other countries' support, they should reflect profoundly and appropriately change their attitude and manner to history.",
