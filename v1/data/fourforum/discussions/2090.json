   "Greetings All, \n \n Throughout history, human society has suffered from terrorism, violence, and extremism. This suffering has increased in this day and age, causing physical and moral damage to many communities and culminating in an international phenomenon which preoccupies the mind and causes concern to everyone seeking peace, security and stability.\n \n Islam, undoubtedly, has a clear stand on terrorism, violence, and extremism and on their causes as it abhors such phenomena and combats them, calling for cooperation with others to protect mankind from their dangers and consequences. Given its complex nature, terrorism requires scientific investigation which addresses its roots, causes, consequences and the ways to combat it.\n \n In order to clarify the position of Islam on these phenomena and to expound its moderations, goodness and call for dialogue, the idea arose to hold a conference entitled 'The Stand of Islam on Terrorism, Violence, and Extremism' at Al-Imam Muhammad Ibn Saud University.\n \n \n To view Islamic Stand on Terrorism:\n \n www.islamstand.org/english/index.htm\n \n For correspondence and inquiries:\n \n E-Mail: peace5@islamstand.org \n \n \n Regards, \n \n Electronic Publisher",
