   "1. You believe the question \"Duh, isn't it obvious?\" carries as much scientific weight as any amount of objective, quantifiable, verifiable scientific evidence.\n \n \n Walking-fish:\n And it always comes down to that one argument, doesn't it? Many a time I'd being going around in circles trying to follow their ID logic, just to have them put that assertion on me. It always has to do with some obscure biochemical pathway, usually involving DNA synthesis or expression. The clincher will always be something to the effect that such & such couldn't have existed without this & that having existed first, but this & that would not have come about naturally if it wasn't already designated to be a precursor to such & such... \"Duh, it's so obvious\". Thanks for that list. It is so true.:xbanghead",
