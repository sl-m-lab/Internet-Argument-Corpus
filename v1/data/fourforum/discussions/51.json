   "I think there shouldn't be limit on how many guns you can buy a month. If someone were buying them and then selling them afterwards it would be quite obvious just by looking at the amount of guns one person buys. Most people buy 1 to 3 guns a month depending on how \"rich\" they are. Besides, straw purchases are not a major problem as the media or pro-gun control groups make it out to be. Also, if people were truly doing this on a regular basis (buying then selling guns) the people buying them must be realllllllly stupid...I mean who the hell will pay the extra dough for a glock (which will run about 500 bucks or so) That means the gun will cost about let's say 800 bucks if the guy wants to make some money...who will buy it? I'm sure a criminal won't..that's a huge mark up. There's no way a criminal would buy that...besides it would be traceable to the original owner if the criminal is caught (let's say he bought that highly inflated price of the gun). This is what I think really happens.\n \n Felony on record-guy can't get a gun\n So either he can get a family member who's clean to do it (there's this program the NRA and law enforcement is running now \"Don't lie for the other guy\" to prevent these kinds of purchases)\n \n OR\n \n He can buy a hot gun (which would be cheaper and probably better for him)\n \n Personally, the real problem is the second choice. A hot can only be traced back to the original owner and not the criminal. (that's another story)",

More than that is overkill I think. excuse the pun.\n\n But honestly, what difference does it make if I buy 12 guns in one day, or 1 gun a month? I still end up with the same amount in time, it just takes longer to get them all. I could go out and buy my 1 gun today and kill you with it just the same as I could if I went out and bought 12 guns today and used 1 of them to kill you. I would implore you to find the correlation between the amount of guns one owns and the likelihood one is to use them to kill. I myself own 9 guns: 2 shotguns, 4 rifles, and 3 handguns. Does that mean that I am more likely to use one of them to kill someone than someone who only owns 1? \n \n This is proposed simply as a knee-jerk reaction to attempt to eliminate straw purchases. Something tells me that anyone wanting a gun bad enough will find one. A law like this will only serve to increase the amount of people willing to make that straw purchase, especially since their cut will now be higher as they will be more in demand. Or, it will serve to drive the black market further underground and make illegal purchases of guns more likely, which in turn makes the guns untraceable. I would think that it would be easier to track and find those people dumb enough to go out and legally buy 25 guns in one afternoon.
