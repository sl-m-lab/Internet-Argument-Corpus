Rumsfeld, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and their Japanese counterparts called for \"greater transparency on the modernization of military capabilities in the region,\" in what U.S. defense officials said was reference to a Chinese arms buildup that is prompting worries for both governments. \n Beijing has refused to disclose details about the scope and goals of a large-scale military buildup under way for at least a decade that includes three new types of strategic nuclear missiles, three new types of submarines, and large purchases of weapons from Russia and other developed nations. \n\n \n This type of rhetoric has been building lately. I can't help but wonder if the American people are going to fall for it. What we are essentially pushing for here is a full inventory of Chinas military and access to their strategic planning. Considering the fact that we try to keep a carrier group nearby just so we can attack China if the urge posesses us, I would have to say the Chinese would be XXXXXX to provide us with this. \n \n You would think that Americans would be too smart to actually believe that this is a reasonable request, BUT, most Americans are actually falling for the Iran BS, so maybe? After all, all we are asking form from Iran in order to be assured that they are not pursuing Nukes is full and unfettered access to their military; files, strategic plans, troop deployments, bunker locations and strength....all while we routinely threaten to attack them. What could possibly be more reasonable than that?",

We think that other countries should do such things becuase we tell them to. Whether the request is reasonable or not does not enter intot he equation. This is what we did with Iraqs weapon inspections. We could nto find WMDs, storage facilities, or production facilities, so while we had armed fighters over IRaq, we demanded that Saddam open every military installation and government office to unfettered inspection. The fact that it was completely unreasonable for us to expect Iraq to prostrate itself before us while we were activley threatening them did not enter the minds of the American public. All they cared about it that Iraq did not do what America told them to, and it is americas god given right to issue orders to other countries and expect them to be followed in a timely manner and without reservation.\n \n If I was the chinese, I woudl be scared to death right about now. In the last 30 days I have heard bush blame the chinese for our faltering economy, the price of oil, the decline of US manufacturing, our inflationary problems, and the size of our national debt.",
