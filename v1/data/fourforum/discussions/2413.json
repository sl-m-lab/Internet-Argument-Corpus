   "The Greecian and Roman empires fell pretty hard and show no signs of ever regaining their lost glory. And another thing, saying that just because Greece and Rome had it doesn't mean it's right, I mean the Romans had hundreds or thousands of slaves killed in Rome alone for they're own enjoyment. Should we do that? Should we pick up the practice of kidnapping people from their home and take them far away and have them kill each other? Of course not! (Child sex slaves were also common in Greece, in fact they'd have banquets where they'd feast and play games and then all have sex and one of the guests got the slave they used...that's another BRILLIANT idea we need to use!) It's also important to note that while homosexuality was practiced in Greece and Rome, homosexual marriage wasn't. I have yet to find a documented case of two homosexuals in ancient times getting married. And am I arguing against outlawing homosexuality? Nope, just homosexual marriage.\n \n \n \n If that's so, then should I merely assume gays are just far less responsible?",
