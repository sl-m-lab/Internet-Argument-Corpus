   "I haven't posted in quite some time, but I still lurk occasionally. Not much has changed. :)\n \n Someone on another forum I read had an abortion last week, and she typed up her account of what happened. I just want people to read it. Take it as you will.\n \n \"We arrived yesterday early but there were already protesters there. I was extremely annoyed by their presence, presumptions, and gall. One of them, a fat woman in her 30s, brought her children with her, all 6 of them, and they ran toward us when we got out of the car. They were all young but it seemed like some of them should have been in school. They danced around my husband and I shouting, \"mommy, mommy, don't kill me mommy. Mommy, i'm your baby, i'm your son. Mommy i'm your daughter. Mommy i'm your baby boy. Mommy i'm your baby girl. Mommy let me live. Mommy I love you already. Mommy my heart is beating so strong. Mommy you'll braid my hair one day, it's just like yours. Mommy you'll teach me to read and write. Mommy i'm going to take care of you when you get old. Mommy i'll always love you.\" \n \n the oldest boy in the group, who was probably 8 or 9, ran up to my husband and said, \"dad, don't let her do it! Daddy, don't you want me? Dad, don't you love me? Dad, we'll play baseball in the backyard together, just you me. Dad, don't you want to teach me to ride a bike? Daddy i'm going to be a doctor, you'll be so proud of me. Daddy don't let her kill me. Daddy I have your eyes already. Daddy we'll watch football together.\" \n \n they were very vicious little brats and they kept looking back towards the fat woman who kept smiling and encouraging them on. We finally wound around them and then were in the midst of all of the protesters before we could safely cross the street and they were even worse than the coached children. \n \n An older fat man waved a very wrinkled $50 in my face and said, \"there's more where this comes from if you don't murder your baby. You need help with the bills, we can help you just don't go in there today. You need anything else we can get it for you just don't murder your innocent baby.\" \n \n when I continued walking an old woman, probably around the age of my grandmother, came up and began speaking very gently, \"you know you don't want to kill your baby, that baby needs you honey. You're his mother.\" \n \n but then when I kept walking down the sidewalk toward the crosswalk she began to get more irate and in my face. She started screaming, \"you're his mommy, you're supposed to protect him from everything, from harm, from death! You're supposed to give your life for him! How can you be so selfish?! That baby didn't ask for you to spread your legs and now you're going to mu-der him because it's inconvenient for you! This life is not for your comfort and pleasure but for the lord's! Mu-derer!!!!!\" \n \n when she screamed that, the rest of the protesters rushed around me and I was afraid that they would do something or hold me back or hurt my husband or myself. They were all screaming at once because I kept trying to walk past them and ignore them. It was very, very hard to ignore the things that they were saying and if a volunteer escort hadn't come up to help us, my husband would have lost it and gotten into a fight. \n \n I would have never thought it was possible for someone my grandmother's age to scream such profanity at me. I'm still in shock about that. That, more than anything else, bothered me deeply. That people are so concerned about my body that they would block my path on a busy street and call me all manner of profane things. That they think it's any of their business. That they think they have the right to do it. That anyone else thinks this behavior is acceptable and that women going to a health center must tolerate it is beyond me. I still can't get over that. I'm very angry about it. \n \n When we finally did get into the health center, the staff was so incredibly wonderful, respectful, compassionate, and answered all of my questions. I couldn't stop telling them \"thank you, thank you, thank you.\" I said it to everyone. The front desk people, security, volunteers, doctor, nurses, secretaries, everyon. I'm thinking of sending them some baked goods from this wonderful company that sends big, packaged goodies. I couldn't be more thankful of them and for them and for what they did for me. \n \n When we left, the disgusting protesters tried to put pamphlets into my hands and bag. They tried to talk to me about getting after abortion counseling, as if i'd ever go to them for anything, ever, after they put me through all of that. And I rather don't think I need it. I feel fine about the abortion, good in fact. And I doubt that they would be encouraged by hearing me say what a great abortion I had. I got the distinct impression that they wanted me to feel horrible about it so that they feel justified in treating me like #### before I got into the building. They'll get no justification from me. \n \n Why do we put up with this? It was hard enough to come to this decision in the first place without walking through all of that and having no other option but to take it, walk through it. I still hear their voices and see their faces. If I ever see their faces again, I may have to slap some sense into them. It was unneccessary and beyond rude to a place where I don't think there is a word in the english language to define it. I'm still enfuriated about them, the way I was treated by them.\"",

But since it does seem to make it \"harder\" then that certainly sends me the message that there is uncertainty about whether or not an abortion is right or wrong.\n\n I would venture to guess that, for most women, the reason that the decision is hard is that the embryo/fetus that is being aborted will most likely grow into a full-fledged person if it is allowed to continue and they are cutting that short. That potential is very important to some women and less so to others and the farther along in the pregnancy it has developed, the more that potential comes to mind. The abortion decision is the WEIGHING of various factors - meaning weighing of factors for abortion (ex. cannot support a new child, too young to have one, or even rape or incest) vs factors against abortion (ex. the potential of that embryo/fetus to grow into a person, the disapproval of more conservative members of friends and family). For some women, they don't care at all about that potential or other anti-abortion arguements, so the decision is easy for them. For other women, the anti-abortion arguements do weigh heavily but the pro-abortion reasons weigh more heavily, so their decision is a hard one.",

But these make up maybe 4-6 % of all abortions. The statistics show that the majority of abortions performed are repeat performances by selfish, self centered women who are more concerned about their appearance than the life they irresponsibly conceived for a night of physical pleasure. \n \n \nYou can have your personal opinions about cutting short a human life, I probably share those same opinions...I did not enjoy my abortion.

Why do you think I can't relate at all ? 2 short months after ROE V WADE was passed my girl friend got pregnant. We were barely 21 years old. It still wasn't legal in my state yet but was in New York. But first we went to Family Planning Clinic for counseling. They assured us that at 12 weeks old the fetus was a glob of shapeless blood which didn't even resemble life. An outright lie I found out years later. So I've gone through the process with a woman I loved and still love very much, but that abortion killed something in her. Something in her spirit that never came back.\n \n You think you're supporting a woman's right to choose and to have control over her own body, but that baby is an individual with individual rights which are deemed null and void in favor of the woman who proves she is irresponsible in the first place by conceiving out of wedlock. Not to even mention that the rights of the Father are also ignored in spite of the fact that he is also responsible for the new life existing. But even if he wants the baby to raise, the woman has complete control over the child's life and death. You are in fact defending a multi billion dollar industry whose main goal and agenda is to kill as many unborn babies per year as possible. And like any other industry, to figure out how to increase those numbers each and every year which is why they also support LATE TERM ABORTIONS ALSO. They can increase the number of babies they kill each year and even charge a premium for the late terms. A win win for the cold blooded baby killers. \n \n \nBy the way, you can't expect people to be \"celibate\" until marriage...this country is not run by puritans anymore.\n\n \n Why not ! You're saying that personal responsibility and that age old value of modesty until married is passe ? Do you realize how sad a statement for this generation that is when just not having random sex is considered a puritanical constraint ?",

It would be sensible for one who does not approve of abortion to address those reasons in the hopes of eliminating the need for abortion. \n \n What would you do to make changes to society in hopes of accomplishing this?\n \n \nNow it's you who assumes much my friend. Why do you think I can't relate at all ? 2 short months after ROE V WADE was passed my girl friend got pregnant. We were barely 21 years old. It still wasn't legal in my state yet but was in New York. But first we went to Family Planning Clinic for counseling. They assured us that at 12 weeks old the fetus was a glob of shapeless blood which didn't even resemble life. An outright lie I found out years later. So I've gone through the process with a woman I loved and still love very much, but that abortion killed something in her. Something in her spirit that never came back.\n\n \n I am sorry you had to go through that experience. I can understand why you would be so against abortion. I would be, too, if I had such a negative experience with it. \n \n It's interesting that so many who have had negative experiences with abortion now feel the need to eliminate it's legality. It was okay for your girlfriend, but since she had such a terrible experience you have decided that no one else should have that option. \n \n I hope that you at least have some empathy for women in this predicament, instead of casting aside all their concerns into the pit of \"vanity\".\n Was your girfriend only worried about gaining 30 pounds? \n \n Why cut your girlfriend slack and not other women? \n \n \nYet the phrase used is \"making a already hard decision harder\". Makes me question.\n\n \n Yes, perhaps abortion for these women is not the right answer.",

   "The statistics show that the majority of abortions performed are repeat performances by selfish, self centered women who are more concerned about their appearance than the life they irresponsibly conceived for a night of physical pleasure. \n\n \n I challenge you to provide the stats that over 90% of women choose abortion due to \"vanity\". Women choose abortion for a variety of reasons - education, work, safety issues, health issues, financial reasons, and a miriad of reasons not described.

Our adoption was closed and went through a church supported agency. My son has always known he was adopted and was told that his birth mother placed him with us because she loved him. He accepted that, had a normal childhood and has shown no interest in seeking her out (we would have no problem with that). I am sure that there are many happy success stories from open adoptions, but my personal choice would still be closed. \n My son is on his way here to drop off my grandson for a visit.

Still I support their right to do so, and from my perspective having had an abortion in 1972, experiencing a hard time walking into a clinic to have an abortion is a relatively small price to pay for the ability to do so safely and legally. \n \n 6 weeks before Roe v Wade, my abortion actually was safe and legal but that was not assured back then. I was lucky to be on a college campus with a newspaper that published a contact number, lucky to be only one state away from a clinic operating temporarily due to a court injunction, and lucky to be able to borrow the money from a friend for the abortion and bus fare to get there. I went alone and was nervous about what to expect from the whole experience, not least of which was the vastly intimidating experience at 18 of having to change busses in Chicago in the middle of the night! \n \n The clinic was in temporary office space in an old building in downtown Milwaukee, run by a group of feminist volunteers who nevertheless provided a well managed, professional experience. But I was well aware it could have been much different. Like women all over the world who currently drink questionable concoctions or put themselves in the hands of shady characters risking their lives, criminal prosecution and infertility, or attempt to self-abort with knitting needles or the like, I felt like I would have done nearly anything  to not be pregnant, to not have a baby. \n \n There was a famous photo published by Ms. magazine back then of a woman on her knees, naked and slumped forward, found dead on a towel on the floor of a motel room. The picture was shot from the back, in black and white, her buttocks pale and vulnerable with a big pool of blood visible between her legs. I could have been here; I was her. \n \n Walk a 5 minute gauntlet of screaming protestors? Piece of cake. \n \n JL",

   "So you went in, listened to one person, and made your decision based on what they told you? The fact that you did not investigate the facts further or attempt to educate yourself on the matter leads me to believe that you simply are an irresponsible consumer. Only one person to blame for that. \n \n \n Let me ask you one question. Did the abortion clinic call you up and solicit their services to you, or did you go to them? \n \n \n I covered this in another post, but let me see if I have this right.

You made no attempt to further educate yourself before making this decision, and now after coming to new beliefs, you regret the decision that you made.

How does your argument protect the multitude of young people who are falling for the same lies that we fell for in our trusting innocence.\n\n \n So now it's 19? \n \n You said in a previous post \"2 short months after ROE V WADE was passed my girl friend got pregnant. We were barely 21 years old.\"\n \n 19, 21. Pretty important milestones at that age, coupled with an abortion; how could you not know how old you were? Especially in 1973, when the draft had been also just very recently abolished. I first voted in 1972, at 18. How 'bout you? That was a heady experience, since the law had just changed to allow 18 year olds to vote. \"Old enough to get drafted and die in Viet Nam, old enough to vote!\" was the argument. 19. 21. Easily mistaken? Hard to remember? No way. Not in 1973. \n \n And your \"secret agenda\" is also just so much hokum. Abortion is not a multi-billion dollar industry as you previous stated. So says National Right to Life: At an average cost of $372, the abortion business is a $400 million a year industry. \n \n And at an average cost of $372, the cost has barely increased in 30 years! About how many medical procedures can we say that? And of course, the cost increases with the complexity of the procedure, which is also par for the course in the medical field. \n \n But then I understand that you have a mythology going here. Abortion providers are the big bad wolf preying on innocent teenagers who are so naive they may as well be 6th graders apparently, all so they can line their pockets with bloody carcasses and gold! \n \n Tell me something, Archangel, given that you believe abortion is murdering children, and given your own alleged complicity in said act in the past, what do you think is a fitting punishment for child murder? And have you paid this price to society? \n \n Of course, I jest. No one really thinks that abortion is \"child murder\". This is just rhetoric. To paraphrase something Michael Kinsley once said in an editorial following the murder of an abortion provider, if you really believe that 1 million plus children are being slaughtered every year, shouldn't more of you being killing abortion providers? Shouldn't you be doing more to prevent annual mass murder of children?? \n \n Shouldn't those of you who have availed yourselves of the opportunity won by others to have a safe and legal abortion at least rent some garments and pillory yourself in the public square, offer a pound of flesh or something for your crime of \"child murder\"? After all, contrition and finding Christ isn't enough for some of those people on Death Row, is it? They must fry for their crime! How 'bout you? Are you ready to at least spend, oh, say, 15-20 in the local prison for your part in child murder? \n \n No, of course not. It's just rhetoric. (Unfortunate rhetoric, when people such as your former girlfriend believe it.) \n \n JL",

Abortions cost money. \n If you're pregnant, you weren't alone. \n Fathers of abused women should punish abusers of their daughters. \n 13? Your father needs his stupid XXX kicked. So do you. \n Get a court appointed lawyer, go after the scum that made the babies. take their money. \n Making excuses for these hardships won't solve them either. \n Condemnation is a form of communication that has the ability to make some realize that stupidity can have a serious price. Giving help to the downtrodden does not have to consist of killing the most innocent in the situation.\n \n By the way, I now that not all lives are like mine. I was just answering some questions. Asked merely in the hope of proving a point.",
