If he's just a lone loony then he's a psycho. The hit list who has it? Why has it been circulating so long without anyone acting on it if they have some \"master plan\" why not go after the younger abortionists? (Well granted less and less people are becoming abortionists) Honestly their are fewer abortionist doctors every year this was really unnecessary if that was their goal. The only thing they did was give the pro-choices a matyr to help their cause. Some will be scared off but others will want to do it know because of the risk. \n \n ...Eh...my head is spinning...we need more details before we can properly debate this.",
