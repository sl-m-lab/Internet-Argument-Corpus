   "(edited for brevity)\n Abortion is the greatest moral evil of our time. Dr. James Dobson.\n (gen\u00b7o\u00b7cide - n. \n The deliberate and systematic destruction of a national, racial, religious, political, cultural, ethnic, or other group defined by the exterminators as undesirable.\n \n \n \"Abortion is certainly deliberate and systematic. There is nearly one abortion for every two live births in America. Abortions are performed in a vast network of clinics around the country, almost 4,000 a day, 1.3 million a year, and more than 40 million since abortion was legalized in 1973. Furthermore, abortion targets a very specific group of human beings: unwanted, unborn children.\n \n While the appropriateness of calling abortion \"genocide\" depends on what definition of genocide you are using, it is a plain and simple fact that abortion is the systematic destruction of millions of human beings. This nation, and the world as a whole, has a sad legacy of dehumanizing people who have something we want or get in our way. \n \n Abortion supporters are infuriated at the notion that abortion is comparable to the Holocaust because they incessantly argue that the unborn aren't people. This is exactly the same argument that is always made to justify crimes against humanity. They're not really people. This is what Hitler said. This is what America said when it used to count blacks as 3/5 of a person. If we can't compare atrocities past to atrocities present, then the term \"never again\" loses all its meaning.\n At the end of the day, if the unborn are people (and they are), then abortion is not only comparable to past crimes against humanity, it is, in fact, the greatest holocaust of all.\" from www.abort73.com",

If a fetus isn't going to be counted as a person then abortion can't truly be considered a crime now can it?\n\n \n As a matter of fact, I think the law in some states now treat a foetus as a separate person in the case of an assault against a pregnant woman. For example, this case appeared in 2003:\n \n Judge Upholds Pennsylvania's Fetal Homicide Law in Fetal Murder Case\n \n \nA judge on Friday upheld Pennsylvania's fetal homicide law in the case of a woman who is charged with assault of a pregnant woman that resulted in the death of the fetus, the AP/Philadelphia Inquirer reports (AP/Philadelphia Inquirer, 1/27). Corinne Wilcott was charged with \"murder of an unborn child\" and \"aggravated assault of an unborn child,\" after Sheena Carson miscarried her 15-week-old fetus four days after Wilcott allegedly attacked Carson. Wilcott's attorney Tim Lucas previously argued that the state's 1999 Crimes Against the Unborn Child Act is unconstitutional because the state allows a woman to terminate her pregnancy through abortion in the first 24 weeks, but under the statute in question a person could be charged with murder for killing a fetus of any age (Kaiser Daily Reproductive Health Report, 12/02/2002). Erie County, Pa., judge John Trucilla said that there was \"no contradiction\" or \"double standard\" between the fetal homicide and abortion laws because a woman can choose to have an abortion, but has no choice in an attack that results in the death of the fetus, the AP/Centre Daily Times reports.\n\n \n And in Georgia and probably elsewhere, anti-choice activists are pushing the so-called \"Human Life Amendment\" to the state constitution that would make a foetus a legal person:\n \n Georgia's House Bill 1 (HB1)\n \n This would criminalise any act that resulted in the death of a foetus. So there are legal precedents for treating a foetus as a separate person, and if the law changes this definition, well, that becomes the new definition, irrespective of what biologists or women think or want. The law doesn't have to make sense, after all, it can be a completely arbritrary convention.\n \n As a man, BTW, let me agree with you that I don't think men really have anything valid to say about individual abortion decisions. It's never their body under consideration. However, they are entitled to general moral views on the matter. My own view is that within certain limits, such decisions should be left up to individual conscience, and no-one, male or female, should be able to dictate to any woman what she does with her pregnancy. The limits I have in mind are pretty close to the compromise that already exists in US law, with abortion being available virtually on demand in the first trimester and increasing restrictions thereafter, as I believe a foetus gradually acquires a certain right to life during development. However, I don't believe it's an absolute right that always overcomes the mother's right to life and make her own decisions especially if her own life is threatened by the pregnancy.",

All I was really pointing out is that there already is legal precedent for criminalising actions that injure a foetus against the mother's will, and such laws do not appear to be unconstitutional to the courts that have dealt with them.\n \n Bear in mind there is a distinction between a doctor who performs an abortion at the mother's request, or to save the life of the mother, and someone who criminally injures the mother and so kills the foetus. If legislators see fit to bring additional penalties for such an action, I can't see that they are acting unconstitutionally.\n \n \nAny act that results in death? So a woman tripping and falling flat on her stomach and suffering a miscarriage would result in charges of murder?\n\n \n No, of course not.

But since you are on that topic, certainly the fetus carries out a PARASITIC FUNCTION in the woman. You can not deny that and be honest.\n \nSo if constitutional law said a fetus and embryo is a human and abortion is illegal then you'd say this is true?\nWhat does that have to do with anything? the issue was the word \"person.\" I can only assume that your evasive rhetorics and revisionist linguistics is an attempt at not admitting that you were wrong. Your surrender is accepted.\n \nThe courts called them property before...why don't you? Were blacks ever just property and were blacks ever inferior like the courts said?\nHuh? Could you clarify?",

   "You said that blacks were not legally persons. The three-fifths clause says that you are wrong: blacks have always been persons. I never said that blacks have always been treated equally or civilly, etc.\nBlacks were legally property. There was no legal ruling on the definition of a word just like their wasn't in Roe vs Wade. Blacks were not considered persons under the law in that they were not treated as such. If you are property you are already not treated as a person. No?\n \n \nI might be able to be convinced of this, but I'm not as of yet. Why can't comparisons be made between certain things (i.e. actions) instead of being made against a standard?\nBecause a comparison between two things is the second step of the process. You would already have a \"good\" in mind (meaning the standard already set) and now you apply it to real life situations.\n \n \nThis seems really wishy-washy. Now, I realize that some people have no problem with things that other people find despicable, but these people are generally few and far between. If these feelings are no more than belief, why are there moral holdings that are held by the majority of people?\nI can't think of a way where good vs evil could come about that is not just pure belief. There really can't be a reason behind it because reason is more of a method and in a method you have to have a starting point . So if you are reasoning what soap to buy you ultimately go all the way back to the most fundamental belief you have (granted for soap its not really hard). \n \n In other words you can't prove your very basic starting point and thus it is belief. \n \n \n\n As opposed to what? Surely not science, judging from your statement above. Religion? Why do you place it where you place it?\n Many universities have ethics classes in the philosophy department. Clearly I'm not the only one who thinks that this is the logical place.\nNo I agree it is philosophy but philosophy doesn't teach one standard for ethic or morality. The purpose of philosophy is to get one to think about morality not to teach one what it is.\n \n \nI must be lost. Why I should or shouldn't what?\n I'm trying to explore possibilities while minimizing assumptions. It seems to me that -- absent a moral absolute -- it makes more sense not to assume one. I'll explore ideas based on assumptions, though.\n \nI am saying that without a moral absolute then perhaps they should stay our of issues that don't affect them but it doesn't force them too. In fact, without the absolute standard they can do whatever because of the lack of guidance. There would be no reason to do something that affects someone else but there is also no reason not to. Random chance I guess you could say.\n \n \nMurder and stealing violate rights of people. Good point on animal cruelty. Let's include that in our discussion.\nYes, you force morals on people because they may violate certain rights of people. But rights of people is a morality judgment so really you are forcing those morals because your morality says so. As an aside, since I believe the fetus to be a person doesn't that make it only logical that I be against abortion and force the morality on others? If you could do it for born persons there is no reason not to force that morality on non-born persons.\n \n As for animal cruelty this is just a point showing that morality is often times influencing laws and not when it affects another human.\n \n \n\n I disagree with your reasoning. Here's an example: an email recently went around my school about the \"water fuel\" pseudoscam. Non-sciency people were getting excited until I replied with an analysis of the facts in terms of laws of thermodynamics, which shows that there's no magical fuel as implied in the distributed information. The fact that I was familiar with scientific concepts allowed me to perform an analysis that non-scientists could/would/did not.\nDoesn't this prove the point actually? The standard of science is what you bounced these new ideas off of and they came back saying there is no magical fuel. Ethicists and people judging morality are seeking that standard.\n \n \nThe question is whether morality depends on the people or vice versa.\nI would argue that morality doesn't depend on the people because I can think of examples were a majority of people felt X was moral while it was clearly not and I would say it wasn't even at that time in history.\n \n \nHowever, whether your morality can be justified might be better known to an ethicist than a soybean farmer.\nI don't think so because of the reasoning I used above regarding the magic fuel.",

Unless you have the law, you have no rights.\n \nI agree, the law and the way the law treats someone does not affect their personhood.\nActually, the issue specifically was whether their designation as property affected them being persons, and it didn't as you now finally admit to despite denying it previously. As I said, I accept your appology for being wrong before.\n \nNow apply that to an unborn baby and you see that personhood does not get defined by just the law. \nIt does actually. It just happens that slaves DID fit within the definition of a person, while an embryo does not. \n \nAnd roe v. wade was only referring to the original meaning of the 14th amendment. So it was not an overall view.\nAs the 14th Amendment IS the Amendment dealing with personhood, yes it is.\n \nThen what do you state? Were blacks treated as equal persons under the law in the 1800s? If not, then explain why they were still persons if the law didn't say so.\nThe law still saw them as persons. The law didn't give them rights as free persons, but they were still persons.\n \nAnswered in the last post.\nNope. You did NOT provide any clear answer to how members of a species is defined. Why must you lie? (bolded and underlied per your request - see later)\n \nWhy are you scared to answer? Because you know the human embryo and fetus is a human being? \n\"Being\" still implies individual existence. As such, embryos and fetuses are not beings.\n \nFallacy aside,\nNo fallacy. YOUR definition fits a hydatidiform mole as well as an embryo or fetus.\n \n that does not fit the definition so no.\nActually, it DOES fit your definition.\n \nThe unborn does fit the definition and is therefore a human being.\nIt is a human fetus but not a being. Likewise, the hydatidiform mole is a human hydatidiform mole but not a being.\n \nYou just did in the last post\nNope, I never called the fetus a parasite. YOU ARE LYING!!!!\n \nRoe vs. Wade never declared an unborn not to be a person...just not a person in terms of the 14th amendment.\nAnd as the 14th Amendment is the one dealing with that subject, Roe vs Wade showed that the fetus is not a person, your revisionist linguistic hyperbole none withstanding.\n \nSo were blacks inferior beings in the 1800s?\n\"inferiour beings\"? I don't recall having seen that claimed anywhere.\n \nYou haven't claimed no species?\nCorrect. So you are again lying.\n \n Then what species is the unborn?\nIt may be a human unborn. Again, how do you define a member of a species? Despite your lies, you have NOT given an answer to this. Please explain what a \"type specimen\" is and how that has implications for your argument. And again, what implications do your argument have for a hydatidiform mole growing in a human woman's uterus?\n \nOnly to a fool.\n\n Reported :) (that is how you debate, after all, right?)\n \nSo if the law changes then you'd be against abortion?\nThe law's definition of a person is irrelevant to my view on abortions, so no. This is an issue of you lying about the fetus being abortion, nothing else. It has nothing to do with abortions, ONLY about your LIES.\n \nHuman being is a biological issue and it just so happens the unborn is defined as a human being (no surprise). \nYour claim about the fetus being \"defined\" as a human being is just another LIE in the long row of LIES you have continued to spew here. It is pathetic that you must LIE all the time in order to post and that you don't know how not to LIE.\n \nAnd you agree with this?\nWith the intent of the law, no. That at the time this indeed was the law, yes.\n \nPerhaps I should start counting how many times you use the word \"lie\" (or variation) in your posts.\nHave at it. The way you post, that count will go up as your are rapidly escalating your LIES. (I am bolding and underlining it every time to help your counting). So if you are dissatisfied with how many times I call you on your LIES in these posts, the simple solution is for you to stop LYING all the time.\n \nThe good thing about this is that it gives me an idea of who I am posting too. \nYes, somebody who will challenge you when you lie.",

A flask of human cells is packed with human DNA, but not even the pope would claim it's a human being. At least, I hope he wouldn't. So yes... physical independence and sentience are required for a definition of human being.\n \n \nWell using your definition (which is wrong it does have to be a different species) then you just admitted the fetus is a separate individual did you not?\n \n \n It's an individual organism, though it's organically wholly dependent on its host.

A new born is 100% dependent but they have rights.\n\n \n Of course they do. But a baby doesn't have a parasitical existence, it's a completely, physically separate organism. Anyone can look after it. Foetuses have fewer rights, however, in part because of their total, physical dependence on and umbilical attachment to their host, and in earlier embryos, because of their lack of sentience, or even a brain to be sentient with.\n \n A post-natal baby is not the equivalent of an attached foetus in the womb.

But they don't hold a right until a law or rule supports that right.\n Because you first insisted that it was about African-Americans not being person's under the law and you now going away from that claim when proven wrong. \n Because that's my opinion.\n Actually, the law DID treat them as persons, just not as citizens and free persons.\n Rights are guaranteed by the law. Unless you have the law, you have no rights.\n Actually, the issue specifically was whether their designation as property affected them being persons, and it didn't as you now finally admit to despite denying it previously. As I said, I accept your appology for being wrong before.\n It does actually. It just happens that slaves DID fit within the definition of a person, while an embryo does not. \n As the 14th Amendment IS the Amendment dealing with personhood, yes it is.\n The law still saw them as persons. The law didn't give them rights as free persons, but they were still persons.\n Nope. You did NOT provide any clear answer to how members of a species is defined. Why must you lie? (bolded and underlied per your request - see later)\n \"Being\" still implies individual existence. As such, embryos and fetuses are not beings.\n No fallacy. YOUR definition fits a hydatidiform mole as well as an embryo or fetus.\n Actually, it DOES fit your definition.\n It is a human fetus but not a being. Likewise, the hydatidiform mole is a human hydatidiform mole but not a being.\n Nope, I never called the fetus a parasite. YOU ARE LYING!!!!\n And as the 14th Amendment is the one dealing with that subject, Roe vs Wade showed that the fetus is not a person, your revisionist linguistic hyperbole none withstanding.\n \"inferiour beings\"? I don't recall having seen that claimed anywhere.\n Correct. So you are again lying.\n It may be a human unborn. Again, how do you define a member of a species? Despite your lies, you have NOT given an answer to this. Please explain what a \"type specimen\" is and how that has implications for your argument. And again, what implications do your argument have for a hydatidiform mole growing in a human woman's uterus?\n \n Reported :) (that is how you debate, after all, right?)\n The law's definition of a person is irrelevant to my view on abortions, so no. This is an issue of you lying about the fetus being abortion, nothing else. It has nothing to do with abortions, ONLY about your LIES.\n Your claim about the fetus being \"defined\" as a human being is just another LIE in the long row of LIES you have continued to spew here. It is pathetic that you must LIE all the time in order to post and that you don't know how not to LIE.\n With the intent of the law, no. That at the time this indeed was the law, yes.\n Have at it. The way you post, that count will go up as your are rapidly escalating your LIES. (I am bolding and underlining it every time to help your counting). So if you are dissatisfied with how many times I call you on your LIES in these posts, the simple solution is for you to stop LYING all the time.\n Yes, somebody who will challenge you when you lie.\n\n \n Wait a second....are you...are you lying to me? emoticon_hb",

I don't think that most people would up and kill a stranger given the opportunity to do so without legal (or eternal) consequences.\nI'd say we are inherently evil and often times it is the legal consequences or lack of opportunity that holds us back. A good example of this is internet downloading. Without a question this is stealing yet people find it to be ok because lack of enforcement (easy to get away with) so it is justified to being ok. Of course if you would have asked someone prior to the internet if stealing music was ok (said just like that) then almost everyone would have said yes. In fact, today you don't see people walk into Best Buy, take the CDs, and walk out as if it were a-ok. \n \n So I think people will do the evil thing if given the opportunity. The evil thing always is the selfish thing. \n \n \n \nIt seems to me that it can largely work when the vast majority of people share the same set of morals.\nYet someone would already have to have morals for this to work.

This would explain seemingly inherent moral values, morality in different species (especially those lacking higher brain function).\nYet many moral values are disputed...this forum is proof of that. If it is a trait then you also get into the argument used on the gay rights forums which is if it is an inherent trait then you can't say its wrong (which I actually disagree with). That goes back to my Cho example. If that is inherent then how does one say Cho was wrong and not just dancing to his DNA?\n \n For curious sake, has there been any research to suggest this is the case? \n \n \n\n If this is the analogy, then why does the die get thrown in the first place?\n I was just providing an example of something that happens at random.\n \n \nIf you mean that you might be able to convince others of a better morality system, I hope that you're right.

I have some ideas if you ever are interested (PM only). And yes this discussion has made me think as well...which is a bad thing sometimes ha.\n \n \nYeah, but I'd like to continue a discussion that has real potential for intrigue and civility, even though my half-devil's advocation approach may be aggravating for you.\nOh trust me, this discussion is about 1000 times better than the previous one I had on this thread. Better to talk to one that disagrees with you and doesn't have their head in the sand then someone who disagrees with you and refuses to listen. I go out of my way to hear other opinions which I think is the right way to do it. For example, I attended a Hillary Clinton rally where Bill Clinton spoke the other day. I don't even support Hillary ha.\n \n \nAfterword: Uh, this was typed before I read the rest of the thread. Feel free to take this conversation to a different thread.\nmeh, who cares :)",

All living postnatal Homo sapiens are human beings including those who are asleep, otherwise unconscious, comatose (with or without life support apparatus), or without memory.

   "Yet when one compares a square for size they already have an understanding of what larger means and what size means. If you are comparing for which one is \"more good\" then you already have an understanding of what good is.\n\n One doesn't need to be taught what makes him or her happy or feel good.\n \n \nI'd say we are inherently evil and often times it is the legal consequences or lack of opportunity that holds us back. A good example of this is internet downloading. Without a question this is stealing yet people find it to be ok because lack of enforcement (easy to get away with) so it is justified to being ok. Of course if you would have asked someone prior to the internet if stealing music was ok (said just like that) then almost everyone would have said yes. In fact, today you don't see people walk into Best Buy, take the CDs, and walk out as if it were a-ok.\n\n I agree that this is sometimes true, but I would consider copyright infringement much more trivial than murder or stealing goods.\n For what it's worth, I no longer download copyrighted material. I can say that the exploration that I used to do caused me to buy more music than I otherwise would have. While this is not justification, I can honestly say that it (my personal actions only) cost the artists nothing (because I would not have bought their releases) and that it in a few cases increased their revenue because I bought albums. In fact, I'm looking for one now that I haven't been able to find yet...\n \n \nSo I think people will do the evil thing if given the opportunity. The evil thing always is the selfish thing.\n\n I have, on numerous occasions, given back incorrect change, and not because I was afraid of being \"caught\" or of being judged by a supreme being. Was this selfish and evil?\n \n \nIt seems to me that it can largely work when the vast majority of people share the same set of morals.\nYet someone would already have to have morals for this to work.\n\n This is not dependent upon a pre-existing set, only that whatever the set is, whenever its origin, it is shared. I'm not saying that people must get the morals from society.\n \n \nI morality based on yourself would be made to benefit yourself.\n\n Any truly moral person would agree. Any truly moral person would realize that there's incredible overlap in personal benefit and group/societal benefit.\n \n \nThis system won't always lead to a selfish result or always be immoral but it does lead to a moral system that can't justify itself.\n\n I'm still not convinced of this, in part because of my statement immediately above. However, I can't say that I've rebutted this, either...\n \n \nWell at this point you say there is an outside standard for judging the abnormality of a person. This would have to mean that morals can't be made in ones own mind because you say Cho can't do so.\n\n Not so fast. His morals were not the only factor in his designation as abnormal. If they were, then you might well be right.\n Let us also consider the evolutionary approach. In this respect, there is an \"internal\" morality that is shared by most that still allows for designation of abnormality.\n \n \nYet many moral values are disputed...this forum is proof of that.\n\n Generally, the more major issues are not disputed. Hardly anybody believes that outright stealing is ethical. There were no evolutionary implications of whether a fetus has rights. There were no evolutionary implication of the right to bear arms. Perhaps this is the reason there is so much dispute over these things and not others.\n In the case of Cho, one must realize that his view of morality caused him to take his own life, which in itself can be seen as abnormal.\n \n \nFor curious sake, has there been any research to suggest this is the case?\n\n A damn good question. I don't know of any genetic research, but research on animal behavior shows inherent morality.\n \n \nI was just providing an example of something that happens at random.\n\n Right, but my point is that I don't see any case where there's a necessary infiltration of an outside source as you're claiming.\n \n \nEverything is brainwashing to some extent. I say the difference is that a brainwashed brain would have reasoning and logic twisted as opposed to being consistent with what one says.\n\n I think we've seen several instances on this very forum of twisted logic that is consistently twisted and illogical...\n \n \nIt isn't one side of the fence that comes up with boneheaded ways of thinking.\n\n Again, I agree. I generally find it a lot more productive, though, to address the vastly different viewpoints. I used to pitch in anytime I disagreed, but I'd rather address the terribly illogical posts rather than the ones that miss only a couple minor points.\n \n \nI have some ideas if you ever are interested (PM only).\n\n Depends, are they good ideas, or more just wishful thinking?

This is something that is hard to overcome. \n \n \nI have, on numerous occasions, given back incorrect change, and not because I was afraid of being \"caught\" or of being judged by a supreme being. Was this selfish and evil?\nNo, I should have clarified that point. Naturally I think that happens but a solid moral foundation allows one to give back incorrect change.

A morality system based on yourself won't be justified in that there is no reason to act in those moral ways. Why would helping society be good? What reason do you have for being good? Those kinds of things can't be answered by having a morality system based on yourself. It basically implies you (yourself) are god yet this doesn't work because, once again, you really can't answer any of those basic questions (and there are more than listed).\n \n \nNot so fast. His morals were not the only factor in his designation as abnormal. If they were, then you might well be right.\n Let us also consider the evolutionary approach. In this respect, there is an \"internal\" morality that is shared by most that still allows for designation of abnormality.\nI'm not expert on evolutionary stuff but isn't the abnormality the first step into evolving to something new and becoming the norm? Furthermore, you get into questions about at what level is something abnormal (perhaps another moral question) and does this affect good and evil, right and wrong. Can one say that because homosexuals are a small portion of the population that they are abnormal and thus their moral system may be flawed? I don't know if we can judge morality based upon a society norm like that.\n \n \nGenerally, the more major issues are not disputed. Hardly anybody believes that outright stealing is ethical.

Whether blacks were equal to whites was a big morality issue at the time. Now it is not disputed. Are treating others equal not an evolutionary trait? I don't know if the evolutionary model can really hold up under these questions.\n \n \nA damn good question. I don't know of any genetic research, but research on animal behavior shows inherent morality.\nAnimals have morality? I think they have instincts but this seems to be different from morality.\n \n \nRight, but my point is that I don't see any case where there's a necessary infiltration of an outside source as you're claiming.\nIt wouldn't be necessary...just random, happened by mere whim like the dice. I kinda forgot what we are talking about with this though haha.\n \n \nI think we've seen several instances on this very forum of twisted logic that is consistently twisted and illogical...\n \nTrue, I think conclusion based reasoning is the worst offender. People start with something like \"coke is better than pepsi\" and really work their way back to making that true. \n \n I also love the posts where you provide evidence of where your logic came from yet the responses back are \"no, I'm right and you are wrong\".

That is a legal or theological argument, and you can't appeal to science to settle it for you.\n \n Not that you would know how to appeal to science...\nIf science can't answer the question then why do you keep saying my definition disagrees with what biologists say? Seems a little inconsistent.\n \n \n \nSweetums, you select some local yokel from Alabama who may or may not have a biology degree, and who has carefully contrived a definition of human being to include everything except what he wants to exclude. He doesn't use science to back up his preferred and idiosyncratic definition, and it isn't one most scientists would go along with. Science doesn't provide legal and theological definitions. But, since the local yokel puts out the propaganda you want to hear, you lap it up like mother's milk. Pathetic, Steve.\n \n You haven't a scientific leg to stand on, and it shows. \nSo you have nothing and you choose to insult scientists. This comes after you state that what scientists say doesn't matter. You are all over the place. This is the same bs you pulled in the global warming thread so I am not surprised.\n \n \nOnce again, scientists don't waste their time writing articles defining the term \"human being\". Quoting some \"right-to-lifer\" from Alabama isn't making a scientific argument. \nQuoting a scientific journal isn't a scientific argument? You are really stretching it here. And if it is the case that scientists don't \"waste their time\" then why are claiming what they think? You have shown no proof of this and it doesn't look like you will.\n \n \nIt's a pity your knowledge of biology is so weak you get the wool pulled over your eyes so easily.\nThe greater pity is not my knowledge of biology but the fact that you claim to be a scientist and yet just insult them when they disagree with your biased views. \n \n Once again you have no evidence for your claims and I do. This is nothing new from you.\n \n \nA human egg or sperm is \"human\"; a human zygote is \"human\"; a human embryo, foetus or child is \"human\". So is a human liver. A \"human being\", however, is a colloquial term with no precise scientific meaning -- it has traditionally referred to any born member of the species Homo sapiens, and always one with self-conscious awareness.\nYou have shown no evidence of this. In fact, the definition only requires to be a member of the species Homo Sapien...not born. Justify your claims for once.",

   "Unless I have been misunderstanding you in these posts and discussions, you seem to want to use definitions of the term \"human being\" as used in the biological sphere and apply them to the idea of human rights.\n You misunderstand these posts.\n \n \n1) Definitions in one context may change for another context, which is why most dictionaries contain multiple definitions of words. You cannot just pick and chose them for your convenience.\nThen you can't say its wrong for your convenience either. The entire debate started because I called an embryo a human being...which is a correct use of the term. Doesn't matter if there are other definitons, point is that it is proper to use the term and to say it is not is wrong.\n \n \n2) In the context of human rights, there may be no one standard but the fact that the UN seemed to take birth as a standard is indicative of the fact that there was at least agreement at that high diplomatic level. That is not insignificant.\nVery insignificant actually. They have no authority on the subject and to say they do is no more than an appeal to authority fallacy.\n \n \nThe main discussions of human rights come into play on an international level - where, for ex., the US accusses North Korea or some other country of human rights abuses towards its people. If international spheres are the main spheres in which human rights is mentioned, then it makes sense that an international organization such as the UN should be taken as an authority. Do you propose another authority?\nIndeed I do believe there is another authority on the subject but I don't think you will like it.\n \n \nIf you deny any authority of the UN and you cannot propose another universally accepted authority, then you would have to admit that there is no authority on the subject and that any appeals to human rights would have to be done not to any imaginary standard of human rights but on a case by case basis. If that is the case, then why these games with definitions? What are you hoping to accomplish? It just seems to be a pointless direction.\nThe UN is not universally accepted for one and if it were then it still doesn't make it a source of human rights because acceptance of something doesn't make it true. If the UN felt blacks were inferior then I'd still claim this is wrong. As for the rest of the conclusion you draw, it doesn't follow from the reasoning you presented.",

Doesn't matter if there are other definitons, point is that it is proper to use the term and to say it is not is wrong.\n\n Do you or don't you aknowledge that words can have multiple definitions depending on the context? If you don't aknowledge that, then you would really need to look at more dictionaries - multiple definitions are everywhere.

It just seems like a pointless exercise.\n \n As for the term \"human rights\", though there is a lot of agreement on the term, there also does seem to be some differences of opinion (apparently, at least on whether or not it applies to fetuses) by different groups so there doesn't seem to be one standard definition that is universally accepted. Nevertheless, since the term \"human rights\" is most often used in the context of international relations, wars, and the treatment of governments of their people, I do think that the UN and other such international bodies do have some authority on the subject (at least more so than any other groups) that one can refer to as a global standard. However, even though that is the closest thing that we have as a standard when it comes to the usual use of the term human rights, I do not think that standards need to be fixed for all time. One can change standards by convincing people with arguements that appeal to reason and emotion. To be in the least bit convincing, any extention of human rights to zygotes or fetuses requires such arguements. \n \nIndeed I do believe there is another authority on the subject but I don't think you will like it.\n\n You may claim your particular Christian religion as an authority but you know full well that it is not a universally aknowledged authority so you cannot claim it as such. The UN is far more universally aknowledged and far more quoted and referenced in its views on human rights than are religious institutions. The UN is far more of a player in situations where human rights are referenced. That is why I refer to it as an authority. Nevertheless, again, just because it is an authority in the usual use of the term \"human rights\", that does not mean that one cannot try to extend the use of that term. However, to extend the use of that term from its common use, you need to convince people through arguements. Games with definitions just do not cut it - such efforts are utterly unconvincing.\n \nThe UN is not universally accepted for one and if it were then it still doesn't make it a source of human rights because acceptance of something doesn't make it true. If the UN felt blacks were inferior then I'd still claim this is wrong. \n\n The UN is the closest thing we have to a universally accepted authority but I agree that authorities are not always right. However, if one wants to convince people to do something outside of the standard supported by that authority, then one needs to convince others. You have simply not been convincing when it comes to supporting rights for zygotes and embryos.\n \n You often compare the lack of rights of zygotes and embryos to the earlier lack of rights for blacks. It just makes no sense to make that comparison if one doesn't analyze WHY blacks were deprived of rights and WHY they were eventually given rights - i.e. what arguements were used to give them rights.",

Not potential sentience, if all goes well, at some point in the developmental future, but actual sentience.\n You have no evidence for any of your claims here. Why is this? Why do you appeal to science after saying I can't? Why you choose to misrepresent what a human being is? The inconsistent view here is from you. \n \n \nYou didn't quote a scientific journal. You quoted some individual's personal opinion published in some publication that no-one else here except you had ever heard of. You seem to think that scientists should accord the same reverent respect to every third grade rag with \"science\" in its title the way you revere your bible. Science doesn't work that way. A personal opinion is still just a personal opinion.\nIt is a biologists view in a scientific journal. Why do you choose to ignore some scientists when they disagree with you even when you have no proof that they are wrong? In fact, you dismiss them without even hearing what they have to say. \n \n \nSteve, what \"evidence\" do you have??? Someone's personal opinion!\nDon't worry about my evidence when you have presented none. Let's see you back up your claims for once.\n \n \nMy posts are a long string of justifications. You are just dogmatically incapable of understanding my position, let alone accepting it. As usual, your religious beliefs get in the way of your common sense.\nLong string of justifications? Things like \" I didn't know they could read in Alabama\"? Justifications require you to actually show evidence or at least make a logical argument for something. You have done nothing more than slander others. So if your justifications is that \"everyone else is wrong\" then I'd say that isn't a good reason. You can start by backing this up: \"fully functional brain for sentience, which most of us would agree is an essential feature of a live \"human being\"\".",

   "Another opinion", 
   "You can use it in any context but that doesn't mean when used it means that. For example \"person\" in the constitution means something different than what person means in another context but if you use person when talking about the constitution you can use it in whatever context you want.\n\n When one stays within context, one can use the definition that is appropriate for that context. It is just not valid to automatically claim authority of a definition in one context to use that definition in another context. I'm not sure if you agree or disagree. So, I will ask - are you or are you not trying to apply the definition of \"human being\" as might be used in biology to the context of \"human rights\"? If so, then that is what we are objecting to. If not, then please say so - it will go a long way in resolving this part of the discussion.\n \nI don't think it is the main area I hear it being discussed. I hear it more locally.\n\n By \"locally\", do you mean that, in your church, discussions are held about \"human rights\" on subjects other than what ethnic/political groups do to other groups? Otherwise, do you claim that \"human rights\" are discussed when it comes to more mundane local problems such as local murders, etc. (mundane only meaning that it does not happen on a larger scale)? Could you give examples or an explanation.\n \nWe are looking at reasoning too different ways. You are looking at it as reasons for giving rights while I am looking at it as reasons for having rights in the first place. I understand how rights are argued for many times but this doesn't speak to why that right even exists. I think an appeal to sympathy is merely begging the question on the subject.\n\n I think it is a combination. I think that there are reasons for rights to exist that one can discuss. When a group is deprived of rights, one appeals to those reasons in order to win the rights that the group deserved to begin with. \n \n Where slavery was concerned, most of us would agree that they should have had those rights to begin with but they were unjustifiably taken away from them. I think that the problem was mainly wrong assumptions made about blacks - assumptions that they were incapable of governing themselves, that the Bible gave whites permission to enslave black men, etc. Mostly, it was convenient for white planters to have blacks as slaves so they easily let themselves be convinced of these bogus arguements, so that they could feel justified in their attempts at enslavement. I think that, if white planters would have dropped their interpretation of the Bible supporting slavery and would have accepted the reality that, in all but skin color, black men were the same as they were, then they would have had a very hard time justifying slavery. \n \n Where zygotes are concerned, the only comparison I can imagine is that those of us who follow Science don't see anything in the zygote (in what it is AT THAT MOMENT) that necessitates rights. Since you believe in a soul coming in at conception, then the zygote is more than just its potential for the future. In your view, it is ALREADY a person like you and me due to the existence of that soul. We disagree. Since you cannot prove the existence of the soul, then we will have to agree to disagree and continue to vote our opposing views. \n \nAnd are just as arbitrary as arguing for human rights for a child.\n\n A child has the same range of emotions, thoughts, possibility to suffer as we all do, so we would support the rights of a child for the same reason that we want rights. It is the arguement of \"do unto others\" that is the basis of morality that most people have learned. The main difference between a child and adults is that children are far too inexperienced to survive in the world on their own, so they need supervision of adults. So, the rights that apply to adults conducting their own affairs (voting, holding property, etc.) don't apply to children. Pretty much all other rights do apply to children. \n \n The differences between adults and zygote are far greater. Indeed, the only differences between zygotes and unfertilized eggs are the second set of DNA (thus making a complete set) and the start of the growth process. Most of us would not look at either of those properties as justifying a life form going from no rights to rights so strong that they overcome rights of the mother to her own body.\n \n This isn't a problem with the reasons but what you believe makes up a good reason for human rights. Naturally it is biased against the zygote because you think a certain mental state is a requirement for human rights. I disagree with this and thus the reasoning to me for a zygote having human rights is rather convincing. I think the mental state requirement is much more arbitrary than one that simply looks at a human being (for purposes we will assume my definition). Mental state varies from person to person and grows, normally, over time. As a human being you either are or are not one. There are no levels of being a human being. \n\n As I have posted in numerous threads, it is not the DEGREE of a mentality but the EXISTENCE itself of some mentality - i.e. there needs to be \"someone home\" in that body, not just a body itself. That someone might have negligible mental capabilities, but he/she has to exist mentally. Mental existence is just as binary a state as is the existence of a genetically unique human being which arises at conception.\n \nTalk to Dane and Lesz, I didn't bring up the definition question. I am merely defending my use of the word. In fact, it is a little odd that you come after me on this instead of the ones that make it an issue in the first place.\n\n They may be attacking you on this for the same reason that I am questioning you. I think we are all assuming that you want to apply the definition of \"human being\", as it might be used in biology, to the term \"human rights\" and claim that, therefore, the authority of definitions means that one can authoritatively claim that human rights apply to zygotes. If this is not what you are trying to do, then please state that clearly and explicitly. It would go a long way toward resolving this part of the discussion.",

Do I get more rights for being college educated? What about with a graduate degree or PhD? Do I get more rights for those? Your argument makes no sense and even counters the UN human rights argument which is by far one of the worst. \n \n \n There you go again, creating straw men to flail against.

   "Another opinion", 
   "At the time of the discussion I was having I was not discussing anything to do with human rights even though the subject was implied. This is not say I don't think human being can be used in a discussion of human rights while referring to a fetus as a human being.\n\n The whole point was that the subject of human rights and abortion was, as you say, implied. If you had been having that discussion in a completely new forum (not 4forums.com where your views are known) that has nothing to do with abortion or human rights, then you probably would have had much less enthusiastic rebuttals of your arguements of embryos being called biologically human beings, since there would have been no assumed conotations carried with that word. Your arguements here of embryos being called human beings was obviously transparent - at least to me and I would be very surprised if had not been transparent to the others you were discussing this point with. \n \nI mean a few things by it. I mean it in disputes between local/state government or even federal and the citizens or between two citizens or just between people discussing philosophy. My job requires me to be around universities a lot so many thats why.\n\n Can you give some specific examples of more everyday situations in the US where \"human rights\" are discussed?\n \nOnce again an appeal doesn't focus on the reasons for the right.\n\n It doesn't necessarily focus on that, but the appeals for rights in specific situations often mimic the original drive for rights that drove people to demand them and governments to eventually grant them. However, my guess is that it is not these people-demanded and government-granted rights that you had in mind but that you have in mind some automatically existing rights based on a global proclamation of rights - be they \"natural rights\" or a religious view of rights.\n \n I suspect that we may be getting back into the discussion territory of proclamations vs reasons, where I think that there were original reasons for people to have rights and you may think that there is a blanket statement that one can make about rights. There were discussions about \"natural rights\" among philosophers, which were then adapted by politicians supporting rights, but philosphers generally tried to defend their own views of \"natural rights\" with reasoning. I think that the only area where a proclamation of rights is not necessarily supported by reasons is in the realm of religion and suspect that this is where you are coming from in your ideas about rights.\n \nYou argue that if they dropped their reasoning then they'd have no reasoning. This is obvious. I argue beyond this in that it wasn't a wrong reasoning for denying blacks but a wrong belief.\n\n I argue that their reasoning was illogical and could have been disproven if even minor objective investigations would have been made - thus curtailing the slaveholders ability to use bogus arguements. At least this applies to the non-religious arguements they used. It would be difficult to disprove their claim that God supported keeping blacks as slaves, at least if, as with most religions, they allow themselves a wide range of interpretation of scripture. That is another arguement for separation of church and state. People setting up laws based purely on religious belief would have supported the Southern slaveholders rights to hold slaves based on their religious beliefs about slavery.\n \n Stepping back to your comparison between slavery and abortion in denying rights, what incorrect assumptions about embryos do you claim that pro-choice proponents make? Here, I am looking for something similar to my outline of the incorrect assumptions made by slaveholders about blacks. \n \nWhere does this soul thing keep coming from? I haven't mentioned a soul. I argue this: human =< rights. Very simple. You see now that we are more crafty in how we deny human rights...instead of before where you kept an understanding of a word and made up things to remove them from that understanding we now just change the understanding. One can easily see this evolving to something like \"a person is really someone that generates worth for the world\" and so we start denying the elderly and the handicapped rights.\n\n You didn't mention a soul here in this thread but eventually mentioned it in another thread when I had challenged you to note the main difference between a zygote and an unfertilized egg that is critical to you. Otherwise, your arguements mostly revolved around proclamations. As for your claim that we are changing the definition of the word human in human rights to suit our purpose, I would claim that this is what you are doing, not us. The only time I had heard the term \"human rights\" applied to embryos is by you.\n \nYour UN doesn't claim there are different rights between child and adults, do you disagree with this view?\n\n Though I haven't read the entire declaration of human rights, it mostly seems to address rights to protect people from cruel treatment. I don't think it really addresses property rights, rights of dependents, etc. So, though it might pertain to the rights of children from violence, slavery, etc., it will not address whether the child can have property rights to, say, its Sony Playstation ... Basically, the UN addresses \"human rights\" (where that term usually refers to the more basic of rights against cruel treatment) not ALL rights - most rights are up to the constitutent countries.\n \nFurthermore, the fact that a child has emotion and thought doesn't make the idea of those things being important any less arbitrary.\n\n It appeals to a common sense of empathy that most humans have. The existence of a sense of empathy in nearly all humans (except for psycopaths) makes it not arbitrary. Most of us were brought up with a morality that involved thinking about how our actions will effect others - where empathy played the main role in those moral decisions.\n \nFurthermore, I disagree with your assessment. A fetus of 30wks is closer to a newborn than a newborn is to a 50yr old but I don't see why we should discriminate based on development.\n\n For the core rights to life, I would not disccriminate against level of mental development but would discriminate based on whether there is any mind at all. I simply would not give rights to bodies.\n \nThis is still arbitrary. \"someone home\" might mean the very first brain activity or it could be the concept of self awareness which develops after birth if I remember from a psychologist I spoke with on the subject (correct me if I'm wrong on that).\n\n Recognizing that there is an \"I\" (which I understand is the concept of self-awareness) is different than being developed enough to experience everything that comes along with being an individual mentally existing being - the emotions and/or thoughts, the perception of pain or other senses, etc. Again, the importance I place on mind for having a right to life is not in a more highly developed mind but any mind to begin with. That mind doesn't have to recognize itself in order to exist. Most animals may not have self-awareness, but they have emotions, a sense of pain, etc. \n \nYou are discussing something entirely different from what they are. They simply disagree I can use term at all when referring to a fetus and I believe I can. You are talking human rights. I object that you question me on the subject when I merely am defending something I wrote a long time ago that had nothing to do with what you are discussing. I am ok with you talking about the rights thing but at least be fair about the matter I was discussing with another poster.\n\n I just saw the discussion becoming boggled down in definitions again - which had proved to be a long-drawn-out, pointless and unresolved direction in this abortion forum many months ago. I was hoping to avoid that by jumping to the core of the arguement - i.e. can the term \"human rights\" be applied to embryos. Perhaps I am jumping to assumptions, but it seemed obvious to me that the arguements about whether the definition of \"human being\" in the biological realm includes embryos were never meant to stay only within the biological realm. It was and is clear to me that everybody saw the ultimate goal of that line of reasoning. So, it was important to me to point out the illogic of that line of reasoning instead of seeing this forum go back to long, pointless, unresolved debates about definitions.",

   "The whole point was that the subject of human rights and abortion was, as you say, implied. If you had been having that discussion in a completely new forum (not 4forums.com where your views are known) that has nothing to do with abortion or human rights, then you probably would have had much less enthusiastic rebuttals of your arguements of embryos being called biologically human beings, since there would have been no assumed conotations carried with that word. Your arguements here of embryos being called human beings was obviously transparent - at least to me and I would be very surprised if had not been transparent to the others you were discussing this point with. \n Don't worry about my discussions with others, the two I am talking to do not care for honest debate and you trying to justify their position is not needed.\n \n \nCan you give some specific examples of more everyday situations in the US where \"human rights\" are discussed?\nThese forums.\n \n \nIt doesn't necessarily focus on that, but the appeals for rights in specific situations often mimic the original drive for rights that drove people to demand them and governments to eventually grant them. However, my guess is that it is not these people-demanded and government-granted rights that you had in mind but that you have in mind some automatically existing rights based on a global proclamation of rights - be they \"natural rights\" or a religious view of rights.\nI see no evidence that the reasons mimic the appeal. \n \n \nI suspect that we may be getting back into the discussion territory of proclamations vs reasons, where I think that there were original reasons for people to have rights and you may think that there is a blanket statement that one can make about rights. There were discussions about \"natural rights\" among philosophers, which were then adapted by politicians supporting rights, but philosphers generally tried to defend their own views of \"natural rights\" with reasoning. I think that the only area where a proclamation of rights is not necessarily supported by reasons is in the realm of religion and suspect that this is where you are coming from in your ideas about rights.\nReasoning only comes from proclamations. For example you can't reason that reason exists without actually violating reason.\n \n \nI argue that their reasoning was illogical and could have been disproven if even minor objective investigations would have been made - thus curtailing the slaveholders ability to use bogus arguements.\nAnd I think you are wrong because you are already working from a different deck of cards. Hindsight can't be used when making an argument. \n \n \nStepping back to your comparison between slavery and abortion in denying rights, what incorrect assumptions about embryos do you claim that pro-choice proponents make? Here, I am looking for something similar to my outline of the incorrect assumptions made by slaveholders about blacks. \nThat they are not deserving of human rights. \n \n \nYou didn't mention a soul here in this thread but eventually mentioned it in another thread when I had challenged you to note the main difference between a zygote and an unfertilized egg that is critical to you.\nI didn't mention in our discussion here and I am not aware of what you are referring to so please don't bring it up unless you have a reference that you are questioning.\n \n \nOtherwise, your arguements mostly revolved around proclamations. As for your claim that we are changing the definition of the word human in human rights to suit our purpose, I would claim that this is what you are doing, not us. The only time I had heard the term \"human rights\" applied to embryos is by you.\nOf course, the definition has been changed for a long time. Again history has been against those that argue a human is not deserving of human rights.\n \n \nThough I haven't read the entire declaration of human rights, it mostly seems to address rights to protect people from cruel treatment. I don't think it really addresses property rights, rights of dependents, etc. So, though it might pertain to the rights of children from violence, slavery, etc., it will not address whether the child can have property rights to, say, its Sony Playstation ... Basically, the UN addresses \"human rights\" (where that term usually refers to the more basic of rights against cruel treatment) not ALL rights - most rights are up to the constitutent countries.\nAren't we talking about human rights? I'm ok with no granting an embryo the right to vote. So are their different levels of human rights now?\n \n \nIt appeals to a common sense of empathy that most humans have. The existence of a sense of empathy in nearly all humans (except for psycopaths) makes it not arbitrary. Most of us were brought up with a morality that involved thinking about how our actions will effect others - where empathy played the main role in those moral decisions.\nThat is still arbitrary because you never established a connection between empathy and morality where empathy is the reason for morality. \n \n \nFor the core rights to life, I would not disccriminate against level of mental development but would discriminate based on whether there is any mind at all. I simply would not give rights to bodies.\nbrain waves begin rather early. Do you discriminate now?\n \n \nRecognizing that there is an \"I\" (which I understand is the concept of self-awareness) is different than being developed enough to experience everything that comes along with being an individual mentally existing being - the emotions and/or thoughts, the perception of pain or other senses, etc. Again, the importance I place on mind for having a right to life is not in a more highly developed mind but any mind to begin with. That mind doesn't have to recognize itself in order to exist. Most animals may not have self-awareness, but they have emotions, a sense of pain, etc. \nif that is self-awareness then I am pretty sure that develops after birth. \n \n \nI was hoping to avoid that by jumping to the core of the arguement - i.e. can the term \"human rights\" be applied to embryos.\nThis is what you care about...you have no idea what they are thinking or care to discuss. I don't mind you jumping in but don't take my use of words out of the context they were in.\n \n \nPerhaps I am jumping to assumptions, but it seemed obvious to me that the arguements about whether the definition of \"human being\" in the biological realm includes embryos were never meant to stay only within the biological realm. It was and is clear to me that everybody saw the ultimate goal of that line of reasoning. So, it was important to me to point out the illogic of that line of reasoning instead of seeing this forum go back to long, pointless, unresolved debates about definitions.\nIt was my goal too see how foolish some members of this forum are. It was clear there was not going to be an intelligent debate on the actual matters. For this reason there was no need for you to try and \"right the ship\" because the point wasn't what you thought.",

   "These forums.\n\n What I meant by that question was for you to point out some examples of more everyday situations in the US that people have labelled human rights abuses. The term \"human rights\" is a term that has traditionally been used to denote core rights against cruel treatment that typically occur in conflict situations such as wars or in nasty regimes. That is why it gets such a strong reaction from people. I would not be surprised if people adapted that term for more everyday situations in order to exagerate the importance of those situations - i.e. hyperbole. For example, students whose choice of curriculum is strongly restricted might cry that their human rights are being trampled. That is not a real example of abuse of human rights. I would call sex trafficing in the US a genuine abuse of human rights. It is all a matter of degree. If you don't want to talk about the most extreme cases, then the general term \"rights\" is more appropriate.\n \nI see no evidence that the reasons mimic the appeal.\n\n Since you don't seem to think that rights are based on reasons but are based on proclamations, then I am not surprised.\n \nReasoning only comes from proclamations. For example you can't reason that reason exists without actually violating reason.\n\n I don't get what you mean by that. Can you elaborate?\n \nAnd I think you are wrong because you are already working from a different deck of cards. Hindsight can't be used when making an argument. \n\n There were certainly enough people around at the time arguing for the rights of blacks and certainly enough capable blacks (Frederick Douglas, etc.), that the Southern Slaveholders already had some evidence before them of the illogic of their opinions. They ignored the opposing evidence and stuck to their views because they \"knew\" they were right. By the 19th century, analytic reasoning and critical thinking were common enough that the lack of its use by Southern plantation owners was purposeful.\n \nThat they are not deserving of human rights.\n\n I can just as easily hypothetically claim that you are wrong in saying that unfertilized eggs are not deserving of human rights. The lack of logic is the same. Saying that someone is wrong is not the same as explaining why they are wrong. Southern plantation owners claimed that blacks did not deserve rights because they listed a whole bunch of illogical and bogus ways in which they believed blacks to be different. Do you claim that we make incorrect assumptions about the difference between zygotes and born people? That is the only way that you can strike a parallel between us and the slaveholders.\n \nI didn't mention in our discussion here and I am not aware of what you are referring to so please don't bring it up unless you have a reference that you are questioning.\n\n When having discussions with people, I do keep in mind the things they said in other threads as well. People are responsible for what they say, unless they openly admit they were wrong. However, since I don't have the time at the moment to find the link to that discussion, I will leave it alone.\n \nOf course, the definition has been changed for a long time. Again history has been against those that argue a human is not deserving of human rights.\n\n When human rights have been violated, then the common theme has been suffering and, very often, illogic in the assumptions made about the people that were made to suffer. Many groups of people are oppressed because there are illogical blanket generalizations made about them - generalizations about their untrustworthiness, etc. - that are used as arguements justifying their oppression. Most wars involve a demonization of the enemy which is just as illogical since most people on the side of the enemy are far from the caracature that is presented. People who are angry or simply greedy are able to use bogus (illogical) reasons to justify cruelty. That is what leads to the human rights abuses. What would you claim is the incorrect assumptions (about the characteristics of zygotes) that we on the pro-choice side make?\n \nAren't we talking about human rights? I'm ok with no granting an embryo the right to vote. So are their different levels of human rights now?\n\n You yourself once spoke of different levels of rights - essentially legal rights vs natural rights. There are many rights - the right to vote, the right of free speech, rights which protect one from cruel treatment, rights to property, rights to sue for breech of contract, rights for a jury, ... The UN doesn't address ALL those rights. It can't. It is not a world government. It just tries to address the worst rights abuses - mainly, the extreme ones that most often happen in war or by bad regimes that are tagged \"human rights\".\n \nThat is still arbitrary because you never established a connection between empathy and morality where empathy is the reason for morality.\n\n You and I disagree that there is an absolute moral code. My arguement about the key importance of empathy in morality comes from simple observation about how people are brought up. \"How would you like it if that were done to you?\" or other such sayings are extremely popular among parents teaching kids the reasons behind a rule (once they are old enough to be able to be convinced by reasons). \"Do unto others\" also requires a sense of empathy to place oneself in the others shoes to realize the concequences of your actions.\n \nbrain waves begin rather early. Do you discriminate now?\n\n Judging from other posts, you do not seem to understand that any random brain waves do not mean a mental existence or sentience. Just because a neuron randomly fires, thus creating an electric signal, doesn't mean that it is communicating with other neurons in a network that generates thoughts, emotions, pain, etc. Neurologists agree that it is only late in the pregnancy (around the beginning of the third trimester) that major connections between neurons start being made. One can say that they start to communicate with each other in the organization of neural activity that defines our thoughts, emotions, etc. A reasonable analogy would be if you imagined a computer where there were lots of separate transistors that were powered up (so they generated electrical activity) but were not connected to each other. You need to connect all those transistors up into circuits before you get any function. In the case of computers, functions include computation of mathematical formulas, comparisons of numbers, etc. In the case of the brain, the function includes thoughts, emotions, sense of pain, etc. that define a mind. \n \nif that is self-awareness then I am pretty sure that develops after birth.\n\n Late fetuses can feel pain - where it takes a rudimentary level of mind to register that pain. Early embryos can have reflex actions, but it is only later that they can register pain in the brain. \n \nThis is what you care about...you have no idea what they are thinking or care to discuss. I don't mind you jumping in but don't take my use of words out of the context they were in.\n \n It was my goal too see how foolish some members of this forum are. It was clear there was not going to be an intelligent debate on the actual matters. For this reason there was no need for you to try and \"right the ship\" because the point wasn't what you thought.\n\n I'm pretty sure that my assumptions about their purposes were right, but I will let them make their own arguements. Either way, my main goal was not to defend them but to try to prevent this forum from going into another set of weeks devoted to arguements about definitions. Several months ago, this forum was hijacked by such long, pointless discussions - something I was trying to prevent from happening again by pointing out the illegitimacy of the approach.",

So if A and B are assumed to have the same rights you argue empathy or whatever to say if A does something to B then you violate B's rights. Now this doesn't address why A or B should have rights in the first place. Right now we have a situation where A has rights and B is said to not have rights. You need to argue why B is worthy of rights.

   "I don't think that was what I was referring to (just human rights..not human rights abuses). But we talk about human rights abuses on these forums as well.\n\n I am just wondering what types of rights you place under the general category of \"human rights\". The way I have heard the term \"human rights\" used in the news stories I have heard throughout my life has been to refer to basic rights from cruel treatment. Perhaps I was jumping to assumptions, but you seemed to imply that more everyday rights could be referred to as \"human rights\", which is why I was and am looking for SPECIFIC examples.\n \nMorality is based on proclamations because reason is not a basis but a method. Reason can only take you from A to B but can't actually be A.\n\n But A doesn't need to be a proclamation, it can be an observation. Where morality is concerned, 'A\" can be an observation of human nature and how it reacts to various stimuli. For example, humans suffer when pain is inflicted on them. If groups are targeted for a particular characteristic, then most of those of the group will live their lives in fear. There are probably thousands of such larger-scale or smaller observations one can make, and one can use reason to analyze those observations. Furthermore, history has shown the consequences of various moral systems, so many systems have already been tried out. It is not an exact science, but a combination of observation of human nature combined with reason can get one far.\n \n On the opposite spectrum, proclamations, if they are not supported by reason, run the risk of being either unjust in most people's view, or ineffectual, or illogical... I am not against proclamations in general, just against proclamations that are not allowed the judgment of reason and comparison to reality.\n \nIt is simple: Prove reason. You can't do it without first violating reason (begging the question). Because of this you proclaim reason to be reasonable and true. This is just one example of a very proclamations one must make before coming up with a morality. Like in my example above..the very fundamental level of morality would be A. You can prove A but you have to get from A to B so you assume A and assume reason to get to B. From there on out you are ok with using reason.\n\n What do you mean by \"prove reason\"? Reason is logic. One either has an illogical arguement or a logical arguement or a mixture of the two. Yes, reason has to start at some point and go from there but, as I said, reason can start from observation. It does not need to start from unjustified proclamation. Indeed, if one start with unjustified proclamations to set up a standard of morality or of law, then flaws in that proclamation eventually arise and cause problems that could have been avoided if one had used reason to judge that proclamation to begin with. \n \nAnd you can't say it is any different now with the issue of abortion. I guess you could claim I can't prove it to be the same either but I don't claim proof but merely opinion that I see strong parallels in arguments from the slave time to the current issue of abortion.\n\n But you haven't outlined the details of that parallel, which makes your argument very flimsy indeed. I could just as easily say that the fact that you would not give unfertilized eggs rights makes you just as bigotted as the slave holders. When one uses reasons in describing rights, such arbitrariness mostly (though not necessarily completely) goes away.\n \nIndeed you can. This is why I use the argument as a means to advance other arguments and not use it alone. For example if I say X is a human being and then use arguments about how mistreatment of human beings in the past has proven to be wrong then the argument works better.\n\n That is just playing with definitions. I can say randomly that unfertilized eggs are human beings since they are human and have the potential (as do zygotes) to grow into full humans. That is why these games with definitions are useless unless one fully explores the arguement. For example, one could explore the question of WHY mistreatment of human beings in the past has proven wrong and apply those reasons to the new question of how one treats fetuses.\n \nDoesn't have to be physically suffering. It is the fact that a human right has been violated that is the problem. Someone shot in the head doesn't exactly suffer but has still had a human rights violation.\n\n Well, there is the moment of pain of getting shot in the head, but a large part of the problem is the fear that is caused by random members of a particular group getting shot. People want to live and a threat of death causes suffering.- especially if you don't know what you can do to avoid it, or if the things one needs to do to avoid it are too hard to take.\n \nI am asking about human rights and whether or not those are different for different ages. I 100% agree that there are different kinds of rights.\n\n You think human rights kick in at fertilization. I think human rights kick in at the start of mental existence. We simply chose different points at which to start human rights. My choice is based on the concept of \"I think, therefore I am\" - i.e. that it is not bodies alone that I value but people = bodies + mind (of any level). \n \nThis wasn't the point. You said \"I would not disccriminate against level of mental development\" to which I point out that mental development could be said to be beginning with the first activity of the brain..no matter how fundamental. Brain waves begin at 6 weeks so do you mean something different when talking about mental development? \n\n The brain controls both physical and mental processes. Just because a brain exists does not mean that mentality exists. The brain has to be developed enough to have some mental function - not just physical function. Until we have mental function, we do not mentally exist. It is those aspects of our existence which many religions attribute to a soul. Science has shown that much of that function, probably all of it (though I hope not), resides in the sufficiently developed brain.\n \nYou can see how other members of a forum can so easily change the frame of a debate and construe phrases to make it seem like I was saying something I was not. I made no claim of mental existence or sentience when posting about brain waves.\n\n Then why did you bring up brain waves? Was it simply a non-sequitor?\n \nFeeling pain is not a self-awareness but a reaction. I am interested on your stance regarding self-awareness as in the \"I exist\" idea. Oddly enough I have heard many folks argue that since self-awareness develops so much later that you should be able to terminate up to one year of age (or varying depending on who is talking to me). \n\n Many animals do not recognize themselves as separate entities in terms of having any concept of \"I\". So, they are not self aware. Nonetheless, they can have emotions, can have some rudimentary level of reasoning, can feel and register pain, etc. - i.e. they have some level of mind. Once again, a mind doesn't need to recognize its own existence to exist. \n \n Then you need to be posting to the members who brought it up in the first place. It is unfair to press me on it and not the cause when you want an honest debate. I know you are an honest debater so I don't think anything of it but I thought you should know that it came across as biased.\n\n Well, it takes two to tango. I would urge all of you (both you and your pro-choice opponents) to just agree to disagree when it comes to the definitions. My assumptions, which you have not yet refuted, is that your goal was to try to force that definition of human being and then use it to claim that human rights should apply to fetuses. I suspect that their goal is to prevent you from trying to claim that, but I will let them speak from themselves. If neither of you will place any extra weight on those definitions and agree to disagree, then the arguement will probably just disipate.",

So you should not be surprised when called on such dishonesty. After all, the anti-choice crowd has made the stupid claims about \"brain waves\" for years as somehow being indicative of the embryo having a functional brain.

You then have another poster come along and say brain waves don't start until 26wks and I say \"no it is 6wks\" which it is.\nNope, it is 26 weeks. before then, the thalamocortical tract does not connect the rest of the central nervous system to the brain's cortex, and therefore, until then you don't get the neuronal interactions that makes up brain waves. Your lack of understanding of neurophysiology is not the fault of anybody but yourself. But then I provided you with links that clarified this and you PERSIST in your original, false claims.

Changing the definition of human being doesn't make something right or ok.\n\n \n Well, then don't do it. I think when most people think of \"a human being\", they don't think of a foetus.

And what she may think of you in private is not my business! :)\n \n \nThe argument was only about brain waves. I wasn't arguing that brain waves make someone deserving of rights. Brain waves begin at 6 weeks and I haven't seen anything to argue otherwise.\n \n \n Well, \"brain wave\" isn't really a well-defined scientific concept. All it means is any kind of periodic, neuronal electrical activity, and there are many different kinds of brain waves. Foetuses do not, so far as I know, generate electrical activity similar to neonates till fairly late in pregnancy.\n \n So you are right, and they are right, and all is right as right can be. And I agree with you that mere presence of electrical activity does not mean the generator of such activity deserves full human rights. \n \n \nThis is the problem with debating you, you make a strawman argument out of everything.\n\n \n Quit projecting.

   "This is true. Any ol' clump of neurons will create detectable electrcial activity. Organized  neural activity indicates brain activity and that doesn't happen until, 28 or so weeks. The exact time is arguable, but 6 weeks is clearly way early, completely out of consideration, and that activity is meaningless in this discussion. Now, these electrical signals are merely that; they are an indirect measurement of brain activity, organized or not, and may or may not relate to \"thoughts\" or sentience. It is likely that anything of that sort occurs some time after the first organized electrical activity appears, if it even occurs before birth. Some have argued that true human thought requires a degree of external stimuli that can only occur upon entering the world.\n\n \n I completely agree. This \"brain waves at 6 weeks!!!\" is just another ploy by religious activists to make early abortion seem far worse than it is. It's nothing more than anti-abortion propaganda. \n \n Anti-abortionists are really shooting themselves in the foot with this one. On the one hand, if they really mean that neuronal activity is the gold standard for possession of human rights, then they haven't a leg to stand on with regard to abortion before six weeks. On the other, they really set themselves up for scientific refutation as to where to draw the line. If science ever decides when self-awareness emerges during foetal development (or even post-natal development!), then they won't have a leg to stand on to prevent abortion (or even infanticide) before then.\n \n It's a very poor basis for argument, and it's really counter-religious as well, trying to turn a religious opinion into a scientific.\n \n I have far greater respect for anti-abortionists who argue on the basis that all human life at any stage is sacred (though I don't entirely agree with that -- I think there are rational degrees of sacredness and not everyone is going to agree on them); or even better, that all animal life is sacred, and should not be arbitrarily destroyed.\n \n Now, I'm not sure how far along either of those positions I'd care to go, but at least it's an argument based purely on ethical considerations -- i.e. due reverence for our fellow living beings -- without trying to force some answer out of science. It's respectable, if a tad extreme. Science isn't currently equipped to answer such questions -- all it can do is tell you what a foetus can or can't do at any stage of development. How we deal with that knowledge is then up to us, not to scientists.",

   "Actually, you made up that definition of brain waves and posted support from non-scientific, populist sites for your new definition. You are therefore trying to claim that any cell chemistry that generates electrical impulses therefore could be considered \"brain waves.\" That you are trying to get away from what that word really means and trying to make an argument based on that strawman, THAT is dishonest. So you should not be surprised when called on such dishonesty. After all, the anti-choice crowd has made the stupid claims about \"brain waves\" for years as somehow being indicative of the embryo having a functional brain. YOU chose to run with that concept rather than honestly exploring the meaning of neuro-embryology so that instead of factual reality, you could push some emotional histrionics based on a lie. In other words, you distorted facts into anti-choice rhetorics and lies. That is what typically happens when arguing with the anti-abortion fanatics.\n So you have no evidence to show brain waves do not start at 6 weeks?\n \n \nYou just started talking about \"brain waves.\" In that light your remark is the height of hypocrisy.\nNot to you and not in the context of it meaning anything to me.\n \n \nNope, it is 26 weeks. before then, the thalamocortical tract does not connect the rest of the central nervous system to the brain's cortex, and therefore, until then you don't get the neuronal interactions that makes up brain waves. Your lack of understanding of neurophysiology is not the fault of anybody but yourself. But then I provided you with links that clarified this and you PERSIST in your original, false claims. THAT makes you a LIAR!!!!!\nYou say 26 weeks but you have shown nothing to indicate this to be true. Your links only talk about brain develop but speak nothing to the point where brain waves begin. I do not question the development of the brain. Please provide evidence that brain waves do not begin at 6 weeks.\n \n \nSo you feel you should be allowed your original, old and tired anti-choice strawman, but when others then challenge you, focused on the typical outcome of the anti-choicers claims, then you call it a strawman.

   "I am just wondering what types of rights you place under the general category of \"human rights\". The way I have heard the term \"human rights\" used in the news stories I have heard throughout my life has been to refer to basic rights from cruel treatment. Perhaps I was jumping to assumptions, but you seemed to imply that more everyday rights could be referred to as \"human rights\", which is why I was and am looking for SPECIFIC examples.\n Those rights not dependent on anything are human rights. There probably aren't many but the main one is you have a right to be alive as a human.\n \n \nBut A doesn't need to be a proclamation, it can be an observation.\nObservation uses a reasoning. If you make an observation you are answering questions and deciding things with that. You could claim an observation to be an 'A' (but not the first A) but you still proclaim reasoning to be true in order to make a decision about that observation. It would be like taking a picture and not looking at it (the observation) and then looking at it to make a decision (the reasoning). The picture alone with no reasoning does you no good. \n \n\n Where morality is concerned, 'A\" can be an observation of human nature and how it reacts to various stimuli. For example, humans suffer when pain is inflicted on them. If groups are targeted for a particular characteristic, then most of those of the group will live their lives in fear. There are probably thousands of such larger-scale or smaller observations one can make, and one can use reason to analyze those observations. Furthermore, history has shown the consequences of various moral systems, so many systems have already been tried out. It is not an exact science, but a combination of observation of human nature combined with reason can get one far.\nObservation is merely a tool and not a beginning point.\n \n \nOn the opposite spectrum, proclamations, if they are not supported by reason, run the risk of being either unjust in most people's view, or ineffectual, or illogical... I am not against proclamations in general, just against proclamations that are not allowed the judgment of reason and comparison to reality.\nThey beg the question though. You can't prove reasoning by reasoning. Reasoning is a proclamation by itself. \n \n \nWhat do you mean by \"prove reason\"? Reason is logic. One either has an illogical arguement or a logical arguement or a mixture of the two. Yes, reason has to start at some point and go from there but, as I said, reason can start from observation.\nNo it can't start from observation because you already have to have the ability to reason to make that observation mean anything. You can't prove reasoning to be true and therefore it is a proclamation.\n \n \nBut you haven't outlined the details of that parallel, which makes your argument very flimsy indeed.\nI never was asked too and we haven't had a forum topic on it in a long time.\n \n \nThat is just playing with definitions. I can say randomly that unfertilized eggs are human beings since they are human and have the potential (as do zygotes) to grow into full humans.\nYou play with definitions here. I assume in my example that human being is what it is. I didn't mention anything about what I was referring to other than human being. \"X\" in my example could be you and I if you want. I don't feel the need to argue the definition of every word in every argument.\n \n \nWell, there is the moment of pain of getting shot in the head, but a large part of the problem is the fear that is caused by random members of a particular group getting shot. People want to live and a threat of death causes suffering.\nNot to the dead person. Now you get into the idea of society suffering and if that matters. Well, if society is \"suffering\" because they don't like the thought of abortion then is this reason to consider it wrong?\n \n \nYou think human rights kick in at fertilization. I think human rights kick in at the start of mental existence. We simply chose different points at which to start human rights. My choice is based on the concept of \"I think, therefore I am\" - i.e. that it is not bodies alone that I value but people = bodies + mind (of any level). \nSo human rights are equal among all ages from the point you think they get them until the end? That is my question.\n \n\n The brain controls both physical and mental processes. Just because a brain exists does not mean that mentality exists. The brain has to be developed enough to have some mental function - not just physical function. Until we have mental function, we do not mentally exist. It is those aspects of our existence which many religions attribute to a soul. Science has shown that much of that function, probably all of it (though I hope not), resides in the sufficiently developed brain.\nI don't question your position I only question the statement you made and how it can be taken to mean something different. Mental development might be a bad choice of words.\n \n \nThen why did you bring up brain waves? Was it simply a non-sequitor?\nBecause of what you said. You said you do not discriminate with regards to mental development. I brought up brain waves asking if that is a stage of mental development (which it could be said to be). You clarified that is not what you meant in the above paragraph (quote). \n \n \nMany animals do not recognize themselves as separate entities in terms of having any concept of \"I\". So, they are not self aware. Nonetheless, they can have emotions, can have some rudimentary level of reasoning, can feel and register pain, etc. - i.e. they have some level of mind. Once again, a mind doesn't need to recognize its own existence to exist. \nSo it isn't really self-awareness that matters. Am I understanding this correctly?\n \n \nWell, it takes two to tango. I would urge all of you (both you and your pro-choice opponents) to just agree to disagree when it comes to the definitions. \nNo, it takes one person to start such a stupid argument and it takes two to continue it. I chose to continue it because I can get an idea of certain posters are thinking (or not thinking as the case may be).\n \n \nMy assumptions, which you have not yet refuted, is that your goal was to try to force that definition of human being and then use it to claim that human rights should apply to fetuses.\nNo, I refute this. It started when I spoke using the word \"baby\" to describe a human fetus. \"But you are ok with a woman deciding what is right for someone else's own body...specifically the babies?[sic]\"\n \n I wasn't forcing any term on anyone...merely using a term as one can. Dane would be the first to disapprove of this usage. \"\"Babies\" are a stage reached after birth.\"",

   "Those rights not dependent on anything are human rights. There probably aren't many but the main one is you have a right to be alive as a human.\n\n Ok, then we both agree that \"human rights\" refers to the most critical of rights, not the more everyday rights of property, voting, etc.\n \nObservation uses a reasoning. If you make an observation you are answering questions and deciding things with that. You could claim an observation to be an 'A' (but not the first A) but you still proclaim reasoning to be true in order to make a decision about that observation. It would be like taking a picture and not looking at it (the observation) and then looking at it to make a decision (the reasoning). The picture alone with no reasoning does you no good. \n Observation is merely a tool and not a beginning point.\n\n Perhaps there is a misunderstanding going on about what I mean by observation. Observation is a cataloguing of facts that arises to us through the senses. For example, one can say - that table is 6 feet long, or the sky is blue, or that man is relatively old. One can also observe that, for nearly every human being, if you damage them physically, then they will suffer pain. One can also observe that people have egos - some more, some less. One can also observe the range of human reactions to various existing moral systems. Observations themselves do not require any initial assumptions (unless you want to start making extreme arguements questioning whether our senses can tell us about reality, etc.). The analysis one makes of those observations DO require reasoned analysis. So, the observations themselves are \"A\" in your definition, and the analysis of observations are \"B\". Of course, this assumes that one uses objectivity to begin with to not purposely ignore some evidence or exagerate other evidence - which admittedly sometimes happens.\n \nThey beg the question though. You can't prove reasoning by reasoning. Reasoning is a proclamation by itself. \n\n There are basic rules of logic that are hard to disprove because they are so, well, logical. One plus one equals two. How well people use logic in their reasoning is another story. That is why debate and discussion is so useful when it comes to any claims of law or morality. Some people may genuinely think that they are making a reasoned arguement but their biases may keep them from seeing the subtleties. Other people are basing their reason on assumptions which they don't even realize they are making. So, I would agree that one can challenge people's reasoning but the challenge needs to be based on logic to make sense. Morality and law also are influenced by emotional appeals (we are both emotional and logical creatures after all), but emotional decisions made with out reason or logic have far too often led to very bad results. Reason is an incredibly useful tool in all areas of life - including morality and law.\n \nNo it can't start from observation because you already have to have the ability to reason to make that observation mean anything. You can't prove reasoning to be true and therefore it is a proclamation.\n\n Again, by observation, I just mean a cataloguing of things that our senses show us about reality - not the analysis of those senses. If you would prefer I use a different word for that, in order to avoid confusion, then recommend one.\n \nI never was asked too and we haven't had a forum topic on it in a long time.\n\n I asked you to in this thread since you brought it up in this thread. You cannot make a statement comparing abortion to slavery and expect not to be challenged on it. \n \nYou play with definitions here. I assume in my example that human being is what it is.  I didn't mention anything about what I was referring to other than human being. \"X\" in my example could be you and I if you want. I don't feel the need to argue the definition of every word in every argument.\n\n You say that \"I assume in my example that human being is what it is.\" That is the main point. You think zygotes are human beings, so you apply rights to them just based on that definition. We don't think zygotes are human beings. So, any arguement you make concerning that definition is useless if we don't agree on a definition. To us, your arguements that \"zygotes are human beings and therefore deserve rights' seem just as arbitrary as a hypothetical claim one could make that \"unfertilized eggs are human beings and therefore deserve rights\". If we disagree on the term \"human being\" then such claims are useless.\n \nNot to the dead person. Now you get into the idea of society suffering and if that matters. Well, if society is \"suffering\" because they don't like the thought of abortion then is this reason to consider it wrong?\n\n I would not condone a society which randomly allows people to be shot because I would not like to be randomly shot or face the fear of potentially being randomly shot. This is the usual \"do unto others\" arguement, or its converse of not treating others as you would not like to be treated. I think my mother had every right to abort me prior to my mental existence. Therefore, my moral approach is consistent.\n \nSo human rights are equal among all ages from the point you think they get them until the end? That is my question.\n\n Not all rights, but those basic human rights that protect people from cruelty at the hands of others - yes. Sometimes, there is a balance of rights - as in self-protection. For example, if someone is about to kill you or your loved ones, you should have the right to defend yourself - by lethal force, if necessary. Similarly, in the case of late-term abortion, when the mother's life or major health is at risk, abortion might be justified from the point of view of self-protection. Otherwise, if there is no major self-protection arguement that balances the human rights of the mother with the human rights of the fetus, then then mother should have to carry that late term fetus to term.\n \nI don't question your position I only question the statement you made and how it can be taken to mean something different. Mental development might be a bad choice of words.\n\n Mental development is not simply brain development of any sort. Mental means pertaining to the mind - from Late Latin mentalis, from Latin ment-, mens meaning mind. Since science tells us that our mentality originates in the brain, that is why we discuss the development of the brain. If I have given you the impression that it was the brain itself that was important, not the mental functioning of the brain, then please reference the post where my wording had given you that impression and I will be more careful about my wording. I have tried to be careful about my wording, so I really am interested why you would get that impression.\n \nBecause of what you said. You said you do not discriminate with regards to mental development. I brought up brain waves asking if that is a stage of mental development (which it could be said to be). You clarified that is not what you meant in the above paragraph (quote). \n\n Early brain waves themselves are not a sign of mental development. They are too disorganized which, along with analysis of early brains, shows a lack of communication between brain cells that is needed for mental existence. Even late-term organized brain waves do not guarantee a mental existence but support the possibility that a mental existence might be there. \nSo it isn't really self-awareness that matters. Am I understanding this correctly?\n\n It is mental existence that matters. Self-awareness, as I understand it, requires a mind to recognize itself. I do not require a mind to recognize itself in order to say it exists. So, yes, self-awareness doesn't matter to me for the basis of human rights. That is a more developed mental state (which still happens quite early). My main moral drive is the \"do unto others\" which is itself largely driven by empathy. I can empathize with a mind, whether or not it recognizes itself. A being with a mind but no self-awareness can still suffer, have emotions, etc. - just like many animals.\n \nNo, it takes one person to start such a stupid argument and it takes two to continue it. I chose to continue it because I can get an idea of certain posters are thinking (or not thinking as the case may be).\n \n No, I refute this. It started when I spoke using the word \"baby\" to describe a human fetus. \"But you are ok with a woman deciding what is right for someone else's own body...specifically the babies?[sic]\"\n \n I wasn't forcing any term on anyone...merely using a term as one can. Dane would be the first to disapprove of this usage. \"\"Babies\" are a stage reached after birth.\"\n\n Well, I myself got the impression, mainly from many points you brought up, that you wanted to extend the definition of human being from the biological realm to abortion. However, I will let this point go since it is possible indeed that your purposes were different in your arguements with the other posters than with me. I would be curious, though, if the other pro-choice posters made the same interpretations I did. My guess is that they did but, once again, they should speak for themselves.",

It seems to include the concept of recognizing oneself as separate - which is more developed than just going along experiencing life without thinking of separateness. From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-awareness: Self-awareness is the explicit understanding that one exists. Furthermore, it includes the concept that one exists as an individual, separate from other people, with private thoughts. It may also include the understanding that other people are similarly self-aware. Self-awareness remains a critical mystery in neurology, philosophy, psychology, biology, and artificial intelligence.I think that most animals don't recognize their existence as separate beings. They just experience sensations from the environment and act accordingly based on instinct and some reasoning. Higher order animals might recognize their own uniqueness - ex. apes or dolphins will recognize themselves in a mirror. I don't think a being needs to recognize itself in order to mentally exist and have a mind.

How does the activity of neurons give rise to the sense of being a conscious human being? Even this most ancient of philosophical problems, I believe, will yield to the methods of empirical science. It now seems increasingly likely that the self is not a holistic property of the entire brain; it arises from the activity of specific sets of interlinked brain circuits. But we need to know which circuits are critically involved and what their functions might be. It is the \"turning inward\" aspect of the self - its recursiveness - that gives it its peculiar paradoxical quality. \n\n So, self-awareness is not the self itself but that \"turning inward\" aspect - i.e. a recognition of self. I think one can have a self (in the sense of having some experience of being that lets one experience pain, emotions, etc.) without recognizing that one is a separate being.",

   "I think self-awareness goes beyond just having a mind. It seems to include the concept of recognizing oneself as separate - which is more developed than just going along experiencing life without thinking of separateness. From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-awareness: Self-awareness is the explicit understanding that one exists. Furthermore, it includes the concept that one exists as an individual, separate from other people, with private thoughts. It may also include the understanding that other people are similarly self-aware. Self-awareness remains a critical mystery in neurology, philosophy, psychology, biology, and artificial intelligence.I think that most animals don't recognize their existence as separate beings. They just experience sensations from the environment and act accordingly based on instinct and some reasoning. Higher order animals might recognize their own uniqueness - ex. apes or dolphins will recognize themselves in a mirror. I don't think a being needs to recognize itself in order to mentally exist and have a mind. However, it is still possible that I am misinterpreting the concept of self-awareness.\n \n ---on edit-----\n Here is another quote I found on self-awareness.

I think also the arguments for extending this property to many other animals are pretty good -- I've owned both cats and dogs, for example, and it strikes me none of them were automatons who were unaware of their existence as individuals. Not at our level, obviously, but pretty close. They are certainly capable of feeling many emotions familiar to ourselves.\n \n I suspect that self-awareness comes in degrees.

Is a cockroach self-aware? I don't know, but I wouldn't be surprised to find it has some glimmer of self-awareness.\n\n I think we might have a different understanding of the term \"self-aware\". I suppose that there are various levels of self-awareness and the fact that it seems to be used in different ways by different sources muddies the picture. On the highest level, \"self-awareness\" is used to denote some inner reflection about oneself - i.e. \"know thyself\" - which is clearly a higher level intellectual pursuit. At a lower level of use of the term self-awareness, most animals might exhibit self-awareness by recognizing the difference between another creature and themselves. If the other creature gets hurt, they themselves will not get hurt. They themselves cannot control the actions of the other creature, etc. At the lowest level definition of self-awareness, it seems to denote an understanding that the sensations one experiences belong to yourself. However, even at that level, a creature that is not self-aware could experience such sensations, but not recognize that they are the ones to whom those sensations belong and, therefore, do nothing about them. There is an interesting web-site speaking about this lowest level sense of self-awareness - http://onphilosophy.wordpress.com/2006/06/19/:\n \n \nWhat is commonly called self-consciousness (even in philosophy occasionally) is really two distinct phenomena. On one hand we have what I call the self-model. Basically the self-model is how we mentally represent our selves, it contains information about what motivates us, as well as information such as how we might look to an outside observer. The other phenomena that is sometimes called self-consciousness is self-awareness. Self-awareness is much less abstract than the self-model. In the simplest possible terms self-awareness is the process by which perceptions and knowledge are felt as being part of us. When you are hungry you feel the need to get some food for yourself; it is self-awareness that is responsible for the knowledge that this feeling of hunger is our feeling and that we need to do something in order to satisfy it.\n ...\n Now let us turn to self-awareness. As I mentioned above self-awareness is closely tied to our perception of the external world and of our own internal mental states. It is not simply perception though; it contains the knowledge that these perceptions are mine, and not someone else's. Although I can't provide you with an objective explanation for the cause of self-awareness it is quite easy to demonstrate that it exists. Consider a man who has been for a long time without water. Let us allow that he has the perception of his thirst but no self-awareness of this perception. If we presented this man with a glass of water then he has no special reason to drink it. Yes, he perceives thirst, but if he doesn't realize that it is his thirst, so why should he be motivated to drink? Because situations such as this never actually arise we can be reasonably sure that we all possess self-awareness. Let me use an example to help distinguish this self-awareness from our self-model. My perception that I am sitting down is a good example of self-awareness. It is true that the more abstract information about this event, such as what it might look like to someone else is part of the self-model. However the direct perception of the feeling of sitting, and the knowledge that I am the one doing the sitting, is self-awareness. Thus, in contrast to the self-model, self-awareness is immediate and tied to perception.\n \n Before we answer the bigger question about the relationship between consciousness and self-consciousness let's look at the possibility of animals being self-conscious. It seems pretty clear to me that most animals lack a self-model or possess only a rudimentary one at best. For example a parakeet can be fooled by a mirror into thinking that it has a friend with it, so clearly it lacks a self-model that contains expectations of how the parakeet looks to an observer. Self-awareness however seems much more likely. If you think that animals are conscious in any way then it seems obvious that they must be self-aware, since they are motivated by their desires as much as we are. So are animals self-conscious? Yes and no.\n\n This philosophical analysis suggests that creatures that have no self-awareness can indeed still get perceptions - i.e. can still feel pain, etc. They just will not make the mental step of realizing that the pain is theirs and they need to do something about it. Where morality is concerned, I think that, as long as there is that perception of pain beyond a simple reflex action, then the being deserves some rights to protect it from the pain. Indeed, as long as there is a mentality that is able to perceive, then I personally think that this means that there exists some level of human mind which, by its very existence, deserves some rights.",

The argument FOR terminating pregnancy has nothing to do with the fetus. It relies on the woman having the right to control her own bodily resources. All the stuff about the fetus and whatnot, that is arguments in response to right-to-life arguments. It has absolutely nothing to do with arguments FOR the right to terminate a pregnancy.\n \nAs for religous views of the soul entering the body for the first time, that is a whole different debate but I understand the point you were making. The problem is that as a society it is ok to end an unborn human life based on the opinion that the life is worth less than that of our own.\nRather, that the sentient, sensate woman is worth more than non-sentient, non-sensate tissue.\n \nAs for the unfertilized egg, it does not have all the cells necessary to develop into a fully functional human life.\nNeither does the embryo. And neither does the fetus. That is NOT an argument that is going to help you. You really don't want to go there.\n \n It is not a human life until it is fertilized.\nreally? Sperm and egg are not \"human\"? What species are they? Or are you saying that they are not live cells? Just because you make an absolutist claim about this still means that you are wrong.\n \nSome may call that an opinion but according to biology it is a fact.\nREALLY? You just goofed. According to biology, your claim of a fact is an outright falsehood. PRESUMABLY because you were ignorant about that and not because you outright lied, right?\n \n But here is a hint for you. I suggest you NOT go around and make claims about facts on behalf of science. Some of us here are scientists and we WILL call you on inaccurate claims every time.

   "First I'd like to thank you for your response. It was very polite and you got your point across.\n \n So because the brain isn't fully developed it's ok to end a human life?\n\n For me, until a life form has a mental existence, it is just a body. When I think of someone suffering in wars, etc., I can see their bodies being mangled but it is not the bodies that I feel sympathy for but their minds that experience the pain and emotions due to the damage inflicted on their bodies. I view our mental existence as the very core of our existence as people. If you cut away my arm, I may not like it, but I would still exist as a person. The left-over arm could easily be discarded and nobody would care. The same could be true for the rest of our bodies. As long as our minds exist, we exist. If our minds no longer exist, then we no longer exist. Since our minds are determined by sufficiently developed brains, then we don't exist until our brains are sufficiently developed.\n \n The religious analogy might be the soul and when it comes into or leaves a body. For those who are religious, if they believe that a soul has left a body at a particular point, then they probably will not value that leftover body much either.\n \n That reasoning is along the same lines of why slavery was constitutionally ok. Because in the opinion of the oppressors the black man was only considered to be 3/5 human.\n\n The Southern slaveholders used many false arguements about the blacks to justify their holding of slaves. These included false assumptions about the automatic intellectual superiority of all whites, the false assumptions that blacks could not take care of themselves, the idea that God sanctioned slavery of black men (which is another example supporting separation of church and state, in my view) and others. Apart from the religious arguments, these arguements could have been proven false if objective full analysis were allowed - which it wasn't. To make the comparison between pro-choice arguements and slavery, you would have to note that there are claims we make about the embryos that are false. \n \n As for the comparison to someone with brain damage, that is something that cannot be recovered from. A fetus is developing and therefore will become a fully functional human at some point. That is like comparing a totaled vehicle with one being manufactured. The fact that the brain is not fully developed does not make it less human. It's just an attempt to justify terminating a pregnancy.\n\n But that arguement says that its worth is what it WILL become, not in what it IS AT THAT MOMENT. The same arguement could be used to give rights to unfertilized eggs since they too could become real people someday. To those of us on the pro-choice side, potential itself is not important enough to take away the rights of the mother over her own body.\n \n As for religous views of the soul entering the body for the first time, that is a whole different debate but I understand the point you were making. The problem is that as a society it is ok to end an unborn human life based on the opinion that the life is worth less than that of our own. As for the unfertilized egg, it does not have all the cells necessary to develop into a fully functional human life. It is not a human life until it is fertilized. Some may call that an opinion but according to biology it is a fact.\n\n So, if it is the fertilization step that matters in the existence of a human, then what, specifically is the morally critical step for you? Is it the fact that a second set of DNA gets added to make a complete set? Is it the start of the growth process? In other words, what SPECIFICALLY is the change that happens during fertilization that changes a non-person into a person, in your view?",

   "I'd like to interject here if you don't mind. Another Opinion often argues that emotional arguments for sympathy are the way you gain rights for another. Do you disagree with Another Opinion on this?\n\n Just to try to clarify, I think that arguements for empathy or sympathy lie at the core of many moral arguements. However, any such emotional arguements have to have a basis in reality. For example, one cannot argue rights for rocks because one has an anthropomorphic feeling of sympathy for rocks. Sympathy or empathy , by its very definition, is (from the online Merriam-Webster dictionary, second definition) : the action of understanding, being aware of, being sensitive to, and vicariously experiencing the feelings, thoughts, and experience of another of either the past or present without having the feelings, thoughts, and experience fully communicated in an objectively explicit manner.\n \n Such a valid sense of empathy requires that the \"other\" have feelings, thoughts and experience, which, in turn, requires a mental existence. Otherwise, one is falsely attaching a personality to an object - as in the first definition of Empathy under Merriam Webster: the imaginative projection of a subjective state into an object so that the object appears to be infused with it - where the key point is \"imaginative\" - i.e. not real.\n \n I often find pro-life proponents engaging in exactly this second type of empathy. They imagine that, because the embryo is starting to look human, that it can suffer or that one can empathize with it. Some have even written imaginary letters from the unborn. This type of thinking is just imaginary and false.",

   "I got a lot more response than I had expected since that last post. I'm not going to quote everything and answer everything because it would take hours. As for when I stated the so called fact. That may be opinion, I was under the impression that when all the cells necessary to form a being were there that according to biology that is when life begins. This may have been anothers opinion. So according to biology I may not know when life actually begins. So call it opionion, it doesn't really change my view either way. As far as the blastocyst goes, it does have all the cells necessary to form into a completely functional adult human, that is why I see it as a human being. The sperm by itself and the egg by itself are not complete. A lump of ore does not make a car. That was just me trying to make a point. I love that we have free choice in the country and I don't want to take away freedom. I just have difficulty understanding why it is ok for a woman to choose to destroy another life. The fact that it is in her body and dependent on her is not enough to convince me that it should be ok. \n \n Thelmoose - to answer your question... In my opinion the only difference between the blastocyst and a 7 year old child is appearence and function. I really wish I could see the blastocyst as nothing more than a mass of cells.

If you have a \"scientific\" source otherwise then please share it with us.\n \n \n\n Nope. \"Birth\" is a specific term referring to the 3 stages of labor. \n \n\n \n Oh, ok so that's why \"Partial Birth\" has no clinical meaning. Well whether or not my term was correct, the procedure is still the same. My 1st child did not make it full term, he was a little premature. I guess he wasn't born. I'm gonna have to say \"Big deal\" on this. So the anti-choicers have different words than the anti-lifers.\n \n \n\n No such occurrence happens during an abortion, so your CATCH PHRASE, your expression of emotional histrionics is indeed meaningless your denial none withstanding.\n \n\n \n You keep referring to emotional histrionics. I'm not trying to trigger emotion for effects here. I'm debating to get a full understanding of why you feel it is ok to terminate a human life and why that life is somehow less valuable then your own.\n \n \n\n That sounds like pure nonsense. More emotional histrionics. \"Baby\" is a term referring to a developmental stage beginning AFTER birth (you know, after the 3 stages of labor). \n \n\n \n Ok, instead of Baby, I'll refer to it as a very young human life. Why does it bother you that I call it a baby? How about child, will that work:) I can stick to fetus if it really bothers you.\n \n \n\n As such, claiming that the fetus is a \"baby\" certainly IS a catch-phrase, is emotional histrionics and revisionist linguistic hyperbole.\n \n\n \n I'm sorry that you're bothered that I see a newborn, a 7 year old, a young adult and an elderly person on the same level as an embryo and a fetus.\n \n \n\n (1) How is it innocent? (2) \"unborn child\" sounds like more emotional histrionics. Sounds like the equivalent of calling you an undead corpse. Do you really think that is a normal and descriptive term, or does it sound stupid and contrived, just like \"unborn baby\" does?\n\n \n I feel it is an innocent unborn child. Obviously you don't feel the same way. You see, I feel the newborn child and the fetus are equal. So when I say \"unborn child\" why does that bother you. Now you may not be using emotional histrionics but you are definitely emotionally bothered by my terms to be making such a big deal out of them instead of sticking to the point of the debate. I'm going to use terms you don't like and you will do the same. Like say \"anti-choicer\". I love freedom, but I love life also. The \"not-gonna-be-born Child\" has no choice or say.

   "I'm gonna have to say you are incorrect on this one Dane. At fertilization you get 23 chromosones from mom and 23 chromosones from dad. That is all the tiny zygote (blastocyst) needs for growth and development for the rest of it's life.\nAh, but you said cells, not chromosomes. I sure hope you know the difference. And if you go for chromosomes or germ-cells as defining of human life, then you also have to insist that a hydatidiform mole is human life and should be protected. Are you REALLY willing to do so, or do you think it is time to discard your contrived and artificial distinction here?\n \nIt is a heart beat and blood is being pumped throughout the entire body.\nIt has a heart tube beat. there is no heart yet. Again, your attempt at misrepresentation is bothersome and evidencing that you are either dishonest or didn't bother educating yourself beyond the emotional imagery. Either way, when you make misrepresentations and mistakes like that, THAT becomes the issue of the posts, instead of the subject you originally raised. If you want to discuss the issues, I recommend you know enough to make intelligent and accurate posts about it instead of inaccuracies we then get bogged down talking about.\n \n At this stage the brain is also developed into 3 sections.\nFascinating. How do you define \"brain,\" and do you have any idea what the meaning of what you just said actually is?\n \nAs far as my research goes this is unknown.\nYour sloppy research is not my problem. Again, go actually educate yourself so at least there is no debate about what the facts are. because otherwise, your incorrect \"research\" becomes the subject instead. \n \n But hey, if you want to detract from a discussion about abortion by making it into a discussion about pro-life inaccuracies, exaggerations, misrepresentations and expressed falsehoods, go right on ahead continuing your emotional histrionics.\n \nAt 6 weeks the fetus responds to prodding or stimulus.\nAt 6 weeks, it is an embryo, not a fetus. We are talking REALLY BASIC stuff here, so could you please educate yourself a bit more about this issue.\n \n That aside, a response does NOT mean consciousness. You can kill me and still have my leg respond to reflex stimulation. Does that mean my leg would be an independent living entity even after I am dead? \n \n I recommend you educating yourself about what a reflex is. It does NOT involve actually feeling something or have awareness of a stimulus. So an embryo or fetus \"responding\" doesn't mean that there is any sensation of pain. All sensation is processed in the brain's cortex. And I gave several links previous, showing that the connection from the sensory/peripheral nervous system to the brain's cortex is not hooked up until about the end of the 26th week of pregnancy (ie end of the 24th week of fetal age). \n \n So I recommend you NOT further persist in the pro-life lie about fetuses and pain sensation at 6 weeks or even 12-15 weeks. Check my links if you at all care to educate yourself about this issue. And I also recommend you NOT get your scientific/medical information from pro-life lie-sites that owe their existence to scare mongering lies in order to get donations and disciples for their \"cause.\" A cause build on such lies is not much of a cause.\n \n If you have a \"scientific\" source otherwise then please share it with us.\nSee post 302 again: http://www.4forums.com/political/showpost.php?p=303640&postcount=302\n \nOh, ok so that's why \"Partial Birth\" has no clinical meaning.\nYes, it is emotional histrionics by pro-life lie-sites in order to push emotional imagery to make you forget that they have no actual facts and are lying. I am %$#@$#@%$ sick of pro-life liars and I am saddened that you bought right into it.\n \nWell whether or not my term was correct,..\nThat would be \"not.\" Correct terminology does matter.\n \n... the procedure is still the same.\ncertainly. Now, if you want to discuss the procedure rather than pro-life lies, that's fine with me. But at least show enough respect for us to educate yourself about it and actually know what you are talking about. It is pointless to discuss pro-life strawman arguments.\n \nMy 1st child did not make it full term, he was a little premature. I guess he wasn't born.\nWhy? I hope you are not deliberately misrepresenting how I defined labor, right? After all, if the 3 stages of labor occurred, then birth occurred. It has nothing to do with timing but rather about process. So why that silly remark. That was just MORE emotional histrionics. Please try to go with factual stuff instead, please.\n \nI'm gonna have to say \"Big deal\" on this. So the anti-choicers have different words than the anti-lifers.\nWho is anti-lifer? And it is more than different words, it is about misrepresentation and stark dishonesty. It is very hard to have a respectful discussion with an pro-lifer when that pro-lifer either deliberately or unwittingly posts falsehoods and lies (even if they are not your own lies).\n \nYou keep referring to emotional histrionics.\nAbsolutely.\n \n I'm not trying to trigger emotion for effects here.\nFor not trying, you are doing a bang-up job at it with the emotional misrepresentations.\n \nI'm debating to get a full understanding of why you feel it is ok to terminate a human life\nHow do you define \"human life\"? Is an appendix a human life? Is the hydatidiform mole a human life since it is formed by the merging of a human sperm and a human egg? I tend to go with born, sensate, sentient persons over non-sensate, non-sentient tissue any day. I am sad that you do not.\n \nand why that life is somehow less valuable then your own.\nSentience. But that even is not relevant. Nowhere else are we forcing people to give of their bodily resources against their will. Only when it comes to a non-sentient, non-sensate embryo or fetus do pro-lifers think it is OK to take such control away from the woman and enslaving her. To me it doesn't matter one bit how advanced the fetus is. All the pro-life arguments about development is utterly irrelevant and only serves as a source of discussions being derailed into the issue of pro-life dishonesty. \n \n The ONLY thing that matters is the woman's right to control her own bodily resources rather than being enslaved as a second-class citizen. That's the ONLY argument that matters to me. It doesn't matter if the fetus is Einstein, it doesn't have the right to use the woman's bodily resources against her will any more than a lung cancer tumor has the right to use your body against your will. \n \nOk, instead of Baby, I'll refer to it as a very young human life.\nSure, no problem there. But then, it also is non-specific. Sperm is alive and are human cells, so they also are very young human lives. So that is just more attempt from pro-life of emotional histrionics and choosing words for emotional impact rather than factuality. It is lame and dishonest and lends you to accusations of dishonesty.\n \nWhy does it bother you that I call it a baby?\nBecause it is incorrect and emotional histrionics and revisionist linguistic hyperbole. It is dishonest. \"Baby\" refers to a developmental stage that begins after birth. Why the dishonest need for emotional vocabulary. Is it because your argument doesn't stand on facts alone? From where I sit, that would be the ONLY reason for such insistence on inaccuracies and deception.\n \nHow about child, will that work:)\nWhy? \"Child\" also is a stage beginning after birth. It will merely have me make remarks about your dishonesty. Again, if THAT is what you want the discussion to be about, have at it. But if you want a factual and honest discussion about abortions, then it requires YOU to be factual and honest as well. Your choice.\n \nI can stick to fetus if it really bothers you.\nFrom the end of week 8 to birth, that would be correct and accurate terminology, yes. In a discussion where pro-lifers insist on talking about developmental stages, such accuracy is vitally important. So yes, Fetus will work for me.\n \nI'm sorry that you're bothered that I see a newborn, a 7 year old, a young adult and an elderly person on the same level as an embryo and a fetus.\nBothered? I have never stated that I am bothered by you viewing embryos and fetuses like that. I recommend you not try to portray me as being bothered by that. It is the pro-life insistence on inaccurate and misleading vocabulary that bothers me.\n \nI feel it is an innocent unborn child. Obviously you don't feel the same way.\nI would say that is an accurate description of our differences.\n \nYou see, I feel the newborn child and the fetus are equal. So when I say \"unborn child\" why does that bother you.\nBecause it is misleading, it is inaccurate, it is emotional histrionics. It is as silly and inaccurate as when I refer to you as an undead corpse. If you want a discussion based on emotional reactivity, then go ahead and use all those misleading, inaccurate terms, and you will end up with a discussion about pro-life vocabulary and level of honesty instead of a discussion about abortions. Which discussion is it you seek to have here?\n \nNow you may not be using emotional histrionics but you are definitely emotionally bothered by my terms to be making such a big deal out of them instead of sticking to the point of the debate.\nYes, I can't stand dishonesty in debates. I can't stand misrepresentations. If you can not respect others enough to have an HONEST discussion with them, then no debate is feasible, only a fight about the level of the dishonesty in your arguments and terminology. \n \n So how is that working for you so far? have you had a lot of debate about abortions themselves so far?\n \nI'm going to use terms you don't like and you will do the same.\nAnd when you are factually correct and point it out to me, I adjust to be factual as well. I expect you to show good faith and HONESTY and do the same.\n \nLike say \"anti-choicer\". I love freedom, but I love life also.\nDo you love womens' freedom to control their own bodies instead of being enslaved to non-sensate, non-sentient tissue by theocrats?\n \nThe \"not-gonna-be-born Child\" has no choice or say. If the mother chooses, death is iminent.\nThe mother? Ah, you mean the \"going-to-be-dead-corpse\"?",

You keep attacking my words and my research and my education but you are having difficulties with simple words. You get angry when I call a fetus an unborn child!

I hope you are not deliberately misrepresenting how I defined labor, right? After all, if the 3 stages of labor occurred, then birth occurred. It has nothing to do with timing but rather about process. So why that silly remark. That was just MORE emotional histrionics.

Is an appendix a human life? Is the hydatidiform mole a human life since it is formed by the merging of a human sperm and a human egg?\n \n\n \n When the sperm fertilizes the egg and the blastocyst is formed all the cells are present to form a fully functional adult human. So in my opinion, the blastocyst is a developing human life, just like a born child is still developing.\n Are mole cells not different than human cells?\n \n \n\n I tend to go with born, sensate, sentient persons over non-sensate, non-sentient tissue any day. I am sad that you do not.\n Sentience. But that even is not relevant. Nowhere else are we forcing people to give of their bodily resources against their will.

You feel that regardless of how advanced the fetus is, you feel the choice of the woman outweighs the childs right to life. That is where we will forever differ. To say one person has the right to choose over another persons life is sickening. So that brings me back to my original question for you Dane. Why is it not right to destroy a 2 month old childs life? It feeds off of mother and it feeds off of the money that dad and mom labor for. I understand your logic if you believe the part about being sentient is relevant. But you stated that it is not, so you feel the mother deserves more freedom than the unborn child. You believe it is ok to end ones life for the sake of convenience?\n \n \n\n The ONLY thing that matters is the woman's right to control her own bodily resources rather than being enslaved as a second-class citizen. That's the ONLY argument that matters to me. It doesn't matter if the fetus is Einstein, it doesn't have the right to use the woman's bodily resources against her will any more than a lung cancer tumor has the right to use your body against your will. \n \n\n \n So it's ok for an unborn child to be a second-class citizen? Taking away the womans right to destroy her child is not about taking away her choice. It is about giving the child the freedom and the right to life that it so deserves.\n \n \n\n It is dishonest. \"Baby\" refers to a developmental stage that begins after birth. Why the dishonest need for emotional vocabulary. Is it because your argument doesn't stand on facts alone? From where I sit, that would be the ONLY reason for such insistence on inaccuracies and deception.\n Why? \"Child\" also is a stage beginning after birth. It will merely have me make remarks about your dishonesty.\n \n\n \n I will no longer use the word baby to refer to an unborn child. But your definition of child is wrong as stated before. Look in the dictionary.\n \n \n\n Yes, I can't stand dishonesty in debates. I can't stand misrepresentations. If you can not respect others enough to have an HONEST discussion with them, then no debate is feasible, only a fight about the level of the dishonesty in your arguments and terminology. \n \n\n \n I don't like dishonesty either.

I stand behind everything I've said.\n \n \n\n So how is that working for you so far? have you had a lot of debate about abortions themselves so far?\n And when you are factually correct and point it out to me, I adjust to be factual as well.

You are trying your best, or at least it would appear, to stray from the heart of the debate and pick at little things.

   "A final word. \n My involvement in this post started with a post by precious who had \"one simple question to ask.\" He or she wanted to know why it is not OK to terminate the life of a 7 year old, but it would be OK to terminate the life of a blastocyst. \n \n I don't think that is a simple question, but it is a simplistic one. Unfortunately, this is a complex concern and sophomoric over-simplications such as this does nothing to help intelligent discussion. \n \n Some people consider we may treat these two entities differently. Why would that be? The amazingly obvious answer is because they are very different entities. Certainly they share some characteristics, but are they are not the same. Obviously not. That is why there is room for discussion on how one might treat these two entities differently. If you feel it is not right to terminate the life of a blastocyst because it has the potential to develop into a viable baby, fine. I see that as a valid point. I disagree, but I see the point. \n \n But to imply that the difference between the blastocyst and the grade schooler is so small that they are essentially the same is absurd. Calling this a \"simple question\" ignores some obvious facts. That is all I am trying to say. \n \n Lastly, using a moniker like precious life implies you think life is precious. The further implication is that others do not. I would guess there are some persons who do not consider life precious but I am not one of them. If you are of the belief that no persons who are favor legalized abortion consider life precious, you are incorrect.",

   "Stem cells from a tiny mole can not be used to create human parts because it is not human.\nYou have NO clue what a hydatidiform mole is, do you! Please educate yourself:\n http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec22/ch252/ch252h.html\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydatidiform_mole\n \nThe blastocyst has all the stemcells necessary to create all of the functional human parts. If you have issues with this then go to:\n \"I can't post liinks because my post count isn't high enough yet\"\n I'll say it again and again, a blastocyst has all the cells necessary to develop into a fully functional adult human life.\nAnd the hydatidiform moles have exactly the same genetic makeup.\n \nAfter 21 days there is a heart beat at about 75-80 beats per minute. It pumps blood throughout the entire body. That's what the heart does, it pumps blood.\nAnd at that time, there is nothing but a pulsating tube that does not pump anything. Why do you persist in repeating that lie? Are you deliberately dishonest, or just to lazy to check out things before you post them as facts? regardless, you end up posting falsehoods.\n \nSaying my research is incorrect and assuming I do not understand what I am talking about takes away from the heart of the debate.\nIt doesn't take away from you posting a flat-out falsehood of the \"fetus\" [sic} feeling pain at 6 weeks. THAT is the issue here, you posting falsehoods.\n \n At 3 weeks the brain divides into 3 sections (forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain). I can go into more details if you like. Do you want me to go into more details? \nYes, please. Include what a \"brain\" is and what the significance of your claim is (other than your already proven false claim of pain sensation).\n \nFunny, you talk about detracting from a discussion about abortion and you've been doing this the entire time by attacking every little word I write:)\nHave an HONEST discussion with factual information, and we have a chance. When you continue to make false claims, whether deliberately or from extreme ignorance, then there can be no honest discussion until that falsehood has been resolved.\n \nI have been pro-life since long before the websites existed.\nSo are you saying that you got those falsehoods from somewhere other than the pro-life lie-sites? fascinating. What lies preceded the lie-sites?\n \nYou sound like you are getting angry.\nNot at all, I am merely disgusted with all pro-lifers' endless dishonesty and ignorance. So until they/you are honest, there is little other to do than expose that endless stream of lies and misrepresentations.\n \nI am not using emotional histrionics.\nSure you are, I documented it. You denying what is documented is merely a strong indication that you are not honest.\n \nAnd what does pro-life websites and imagery have to do with our current debate? Am I pusing images on you?\nYou referenced them and the fetal pron silliness they try to push.\n \nDane, this is getting rediculous. You keep attacking my words and my research and my education\nAll of which have been documented circumspect to the point where even other pro-lifers find fault with your claim. The ridiculousness is you clinging to claims that have been proven false.\n \nbut you are having difficulties with simple words. You get angry when I call a fetus an unborn child! Look in the dictionary! \nSo agree to be an undead corpse, ok whatever. If you have such a desperate need for your revisionist linguistics and emotional histrionics, then it is clear that you have no actual argument, only sophistry.\n \nGo to Merriam Websters online dictionary and look at the 1st definition of child. The unborn have always been properly referred to as children. \nWell, just for the heck of it, I checked \"fetus\":\n \n: an unborn or unhatched vertebrate especially after attaining the basic structural plan of its kind; specifically : a developing human from usually two months after conception to birth\n\n \nOh, wait... my wife had a scheduled cesarean where there was no labor! My children were never born. They're nothing more than a couple of fetuses running around!\nThere was labor, actually. It is not my fault that you don't know what labor is.\n \nIf you call me an anti-choicer then using the same logic, YOU would be an anti-lifer.\nActually not. You oppose women having the choice to have an abortion. I don't oppose life.\n \nWhen the sperm fertilizes the egg and the blastocyst is formed all the cells are present to form a fully functional adult human.\nNope. There are some of the ones what can eventually divide and change into a person. And the blastocyst doesn't form until the 5th day. The initial cell is a ZYGOTE. Once again, you show extreme ignorance of even basic aspects of this issue. How can you expect us to take you serious with such severe ignorance? You essentially have no fact or knowledge, only emotional fervor.\n \n And how do you know whether it becomes an \"adult person\" or a hydatidiform mole? Or even that it actually implants rather than end up getting flushed into the sewer as rat food because it doesn't implant (as is the case with far the majority of the fertilized zygotes.\n \nSo in my opinion, the blastocyst is a developing human life, just like a born child is still developing.\nAnd in my opinion, it is a mass of non-sentient, non-sensate cells. So what?\n \nAre mole cells not different than human cells?\nNope. How would you tell the difference? A cell with the same number of chromosomes and genes, human in origin, no different than that of the zygote?\n \nSo you have just explained yourself. You feel that regardless of how advanced the fetus is, you feel the choice of the woman outweighs the childs right to life.\nNope. It outweighs an embryo's or a fetus \"right\" to use the woman's bodily resources against her will. I said nothing about children, your emotional histrionics none withstanding.\n \nThat is where we will forever differ.\nYes, we have a difference in OPINION.\n \nTo say one person has the right to choose over another persons life is sickening.\nA position I do not hold, your blatant lie none withstanding. \n \n Or is that another one of your mistakes, one of those cases where you misrepresent an embryo as a \"person,\" desperately clinging to the sophistry of your revisionist linguistic hyperbole?\n \nSo that brings me back to my original question for you Dane. Why is it not right to destroy a 2 month old childs life?\nBack to my original point: Sentience and sensation.\n \nIt feeds off of mother\nAnd the woman has the choice to let it or not.\n \nand it feeds off of the money that dad and mom labor for.\nNo bodily resources involved there. Irrelevant claptrap.\n \nI understand your logic if you believe the part about being sentient is relevant. But you stated that it is not,\nWhat matters is the woman's right to not be enslaved. To not be second-class citizens to the theocratic, misogynistic culture you promote, a culture of oppression and control of women.\n \nso you feel the mother deserves more freedom than the unborn child.\nNo, she deserves more freedom than the fetus or embryo.\n \n You believe it is ok to end ones life for the sake of convenience?\nI fail to see the individual existence, the individuality qualifying the embryo or fetus as \"one.\"\n \nSo it's ok for an unborn child to be a second-class citizen?\nBack to the emotional histrionics, you corpse, you. Fetuses and embryos, of course, are not citizens your misrepresentation and dishonest distortion none withstanding.\n \nTaking away the womans right to destroy her child is not about taking away her choice.\nBut then, nobody talk about destroying children, your misrepresentation none withstanding.\n \n It is about giving the child the freedom and the right to life that it so deserves.\nAnd once there is a child, after birth, that indeed is the case.\n \nI will no longer use the word baby to refer to an unborn child.\nA hollow promise, as there is nothing such as an unborn child.\n \nBut your definition of child is wrong as stated before. Look in the dictionary.\nYour pathetic desire to use fudge terms to blur known and specific distinctions merely result in misrepresentations. Please learn the CORRECT terminology so we don't have to continue this silliness of you trying for sophistry instead of honest discussion.\n \nI don't like dishonesty either. But I've not been dishonest. I stand behind everything I've said.\nThe fudging sophistry you push is dishonest. I see nothing to disconfirms you being dishonest. Sophistry is not honest.\n \nI don't debate often, I try to stick to facts.\nI am looking forward to your factual, honest discussion where we can deal with the subject rather than your emotionally-laden misrepresentations.\n \n You are trying your best, or at least it would appear, to stray from the heart of the debate and pick at little things.\nI want to discuss the subject, but not based on misrepresentations and revisionist linguistics. If you want to discuss facts, then you would use factual terminology rather than trying for emotional platitudes and emotional histrionics.\n \n I'm fine with woman or men or anyone have freedom to control their own bodies and anything they do so as long as it does not hurt another person.\nBut then, an embryo or a fetus are not persons.\n \nUnfortunately, abortion is a choice that harms another life. That life being an unborn child.\nRather, that life being an embryo or a fetus, your lame sophistry none withstanding. But yes, the embryo or fetus does die as it is dependent on the woman's bodily resources. If you find a way to remove the embryo or fetus without killing it per lack of resources, then I will be all for it. Until then, it is not acceptable to enslave women for the sake of tissue.",

Thank you for responding with a thoughtful answer instead of criticizing my every word. I actually see things a little differently now. It goes along the same lines as freedom of expression. A pro-abort might despise pictures of aborted fetuses posted in public places, but to try to prevent such things is taking away that of free speech/expression. For the pro-abort it is about choice and the freedom thereof. For the Pro-life (like myself) it is about life and the freedom to live it. It is extremely difficult to be pro-life in this world. I just wish that pro-aborts would understand that the majority of pro-lifers don't want to take away a womans freedom so much as we want to save what we believe is a life. I don't think the majority of pro-aborts understand how difficult it is for us to see so many lives being destroyed (what we believe is a life). It makes things like 9/11 and the \"war on terror\" seem so minute. It's sad that several thousand of our soldiers have died and it's sad that many other innocent people have lost their lives, but as a pro-lifer, thousands of lives are destroyed daily. It may seem foolish to a pro-abort, and if that is the case then so be it.\n \n The only way I can find peace is in my faith as a Christian. God knows what is true and just and he knows our hearts also. By the blood of Christ we can have eternal life. I believe the unborn will be saved. It is not my job to judge a person. God is the only judge. I can truly say that I hope I am wrong on my views of abortion. But, no matter, in the end we will all see things for how they are.",
