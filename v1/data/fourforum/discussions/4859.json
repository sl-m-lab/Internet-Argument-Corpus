   "Because the discussion of whether homosexuality is natural is commonly used in the debate over gay rights, discussing whether or not it is natural does not seem off topic.\n \n VTCruiser, I should first point out the most important fact: whether homosexuality is natural or not has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not we should allow same-sex marriage or any other gay rights. Every person engages in unnatural behavior every day. This includes making sacrifices to help others and not taking what you want from someone you don't like. Whether homosexuality is natural or not is irrelevant. That being said, your reasoning does not indicate anything about whether it is natural or not.\n \n \nHomosexuality by no means is a natural occurance. Here is why..

Please tell me how it is if you think so..\n\n \n Your logic can be sort of reworded as such: \n \n If all opposites attract and negatives repulse in nature, then males must naturally be attracted to females and males must naturally be repulsed from males. \n Protons are opposite of electrons, and they are attracted to each other and repulsed from themselves. \n Therefore, males must be attracted to females and repulsed from other males.\n \n This wording of the logic makes it clear that your reasoning is invalid. Simply because you have shown that one set of opposites attract in nature does not indicate that any other opposites attract. I might as well use the theory of gravity to justify the heterosexuality being unnatural (gravity says matter is attracted to other matter). \"Opposites attract\" is a catchy saying for describing relationships between two completely different people, but it is generally scientifically invalid, unless speaking of opposite electric charges.",

   "Recent studies in animal sexuality serve to dispel two common myths: that sex is exclusively about reproduction and that homosexuality is an unnatural sexual preference. It now appears that sex is also about recreation as it frequently occurs out of the mating season. And same-sex copulation and bonding are common in hundreds of species, from bonobo apes to gulls.\n \n Moreover, homosexual couples in the Animal Kingdom are prone to behaviors commonly - and erroneously - attributed only to heterosexuals. The New York Times reported in its February 7, 2004 issue about a couple of gay penguins who are desperately and recurrently seeking to incubate eggs together...\n \n * * *\n \n An oft-overlooked fact is that recreational sex and homosexuality have one thing in common: they do not lead to reproduction. Homosexuality may, therefore, be a form of pleasurable sexual play. It may also enhance same-sex bonding and train the young to form cohesive, purposeful groups (the army and the boarding school come to mind). \n \n Furthermore, homosexuality amounts to the culling of 10-15% of the gene pool in each generation. The genetic material of the homosexual is not propagated and is effectively excluded from the big roulette of life. Growers - of anything from cereals to cattle - similarly use random culling to improve their stock. As mathematical models show, such repeated mass removal of DNA from the common brew seems to optimize the species and increase its resilience and efficiency.\n \n It is ironic to realize that homosexuality and other forms of non-reproductive, pleasure-seeking sex may be key evolutionary mechanisms and integral drivers of population dynamics. Reproduction is but one goal among many, equally important, end results. Heterosexuality is but one strategy among a few optimal solutions. Studying biology may yet lead to greater tolerance for the vast repertory of human sexual foibles, preferences, and predilections. Back to nature, in this case, may be forward to civilization.\n http://globalpolitician.com/articledes.asp?ID=695&cid=1&sid=24",
