   "Jobs Created Question:\n \n Do the figures for jobs created include illegal aliens?\n \n http://www.buildingteamforecast.com/article/CA6435698.html?industryid=43717&nid=2816\n \n \n U.S. employment growth continued strong in March 2007 (+180,000 jobs versus February). This was the 43rd positive monthly increase in a row. The good news on the jobs front drives the economy in a host of ways, first and foremost through buoying consumer confidence and lifting retail sales. The latest jobs figure has climbed back above the long-term average. Since 1989, the U.S. economy has generated, on average, 140,000 new jobs per month or 1.7 million new jobs per year. At the same time, the unemployment rate has fallen to only 4.4%. To a significant degree, it is the tightness in labor markets that is fueling some of the Federal Reserve Board's concern about inflationary expectations. However, labor wage gains have remained relatively restrained in the latest cycle to date, due to the threat of foreign competition and many examples of outsourcing of work.",

In reality the NFP data, including jobs created, contains several \"adjustments\" that make it completely meaningless. If you want data on jobs created you have to subscribe to a data service.",
