He's anti American and prefers living the ancient Islamic way. That threatens our oil supply and will probably destabilize the entire region. Osama and most of the 9/11 terrorists are SAUDIS.\n \n We are currently NOT READY to deal with Saudi Arabia because our economy and armed services are stretched thin supporting a new Iraqi governent. Our troops are too busy playing Iraqi police. With a significant decrease in recruitment, we are down to people that are doing more than one tour of duty. The pattern now, thankts to Bush, is that the people that have done several tours of duty don't go on to become career military, one of our most valuable assets in the past. The military needs to regroup and remoralize. We also need to get military leadership involved commanding our troops instead of our current generation of wimp desk warriors in Washington DC.

   "Invading a sovereign nation based on deceit that has turned into a fiscal and death quagmire has nothing to do with public attitude? How can you possibly equate that with fighting terrorists who have no national loyalty?\nEvery nation ever invaded was sovereign at the time. Whether Bush intentionally deceived us or mistakingly reacted to bad intelligence is debatable.\n \n I have already stated that war costs lives and money. While there is no acceptable number of deaths, there is no valid argument against continuing war in simply saying there have been too many deaths. Some people get more excited about 2000 deaths in two years due to fighting in Iraq than they do about 14,500 deaths in one year due to automobile accidents in the USA (1996 among ages 25-44). I feel badly for the families of dead soldiers, but no worse than I would if I heard that they died in a car wreck on I-285.\n \n I'm not convinced that the war on terror is confined to Iraq, even though it appears that many terrorists have moved to Iraq to fight the spread of democracy or just to kill Americans in their efforts to please Allah. The Iraqi stage does seem to have provided an open field, accessible to both sides whereas terrorism inside the US is hardly heard of. (Not to say it won't happen here again...I feel certain it will, and it will be blamed on whoever is in charge at the time or slightly before it happens...just as Clinton and Bush were both blamed for 9-11.)\n \n There have been some instances of terrorists being exposed and arrested in the US, so some of the effort must be going on here. Homeland Security is likely doing a lot of things that we will not hear about until they produce results. I hope you're not presenting the argument that because we have heard nothing, nothing is happening.",

I wasn't speaking of soldiers changing their colors because of injury nor was I belittling families who've turned against the fighting because of the death of their sons and daughters. I was referring to the sheeple who have changed their position because of political convenience and current polls. It is likely that just after 9-11, the mob effect caused a lot of false patriotism and clinching of fists by those who had no idea what the real cost of battle would be. Now that the costs are coming due, they're suddenly against the fighting. That's what I meant by candyassed teatsucking American public.\n \n If you don't understand that, I'm sorry for you.\n \n \n \n\n We need to worry about Saudi Arabia.

It goes a lot deeper than the \"obstructionist\" tactics you speak of. A low job performance rating for Congress and the President indicate the American public is currently not happy with their priorities. Below is a quote from the article.\n \n \"Approval for Congress has dipped from the 40s early this year into the low 30s now. A majority of Republicans and Democrats said they don't approve of Congress.\"",

   "another poll \n \nNEW YORK Public trust in newspapers and television news continued to decline in Gallup's annual survey of \"public confidence in major institutions\" in the United States, reaching an all-time low this year. \n \n Those having a \"great deal\" or \"quite a lot\" of confidence in newspapers dipped from 30% to 28% in one year, the same total for television. The previous low for newspapers was 29% in 1994. Since 2000, confidence in newspapers has declined from 37% to 28%, and TV from 36% to 28%, according to the poll.\n \n However, some other institutions fared far worse this year, suggesting a broad level of distrust, cynicism or malaise.\n \n Confidence in the presidency plunged from 52% to 44%, with Congress and the criminal-justice system also suffering 8% drops. Confidence in the U.S. Supreme Court fell from 46% to 41%. The 22% confidence rating for Congress is its lowest in eight years, and self-identified Republicans have only a slightly more positive view of the institution than do Democrats.\n \n The military topped the poll with a 74% confidence rating, with the police at 63% and organized religion at 53%. Big business and Congress (both at 22%) and HMOs (17%) brought up the rear.\n \n Looking at the newspaper numbers, of those surveyed, 24% say they have \"very little\" confidence in them, while 1% said \"none.\" By far the highest number, 46%, said \"some,\" with 28% expressing strong confidence. \n",

They give the military and the police a free pass because even the most uninformed realize they are simply carrying out the orders of our elected officials.

Due to the history of a high standard of living in this country, the average American typically has a short attention span. More of good is the only general requirement. Fear works for short periods, but quickly disipates. What the poll states is that a majority are dissatisfied with the way our government is being managed. Nothing else. No specific critiques, just the gut feeling. Seven out of ten is a majority any politician standing for reelection who wants or needs that seat can not ignore. This is a lame duck administration that will, in most every case, be cast aside into the retired bin for public speaking purposes and all congressional members are in the process of deciding who to align themselves with for 2008 to get started on the deals. Unless you're up for reelection in 2006. That's a different matter.",

   "This is my non obstructionist plan of action as an alternative to muddling through in the same direction until 2008. Divide Iraq. The Sunnis would have their own country. The Shiites and Kurds would have their own country. That would free up most of our troops from being Iraqi police. It would end most of the terrorist war of ambush. It would reduce the terrorism to the point it would be more realistic for the Iraqi forces to take over. It would establish a front line again if the Sunnis continue with terrorism. That means conventional warfare, the type of conflict where they have been seriously out matched twice now. Removing the politics out of a military campaign would be welcome in the armed services. I would want to see the military returned to military leadership. The wimp desk warriors could butt out of the situation. This is the root cause of our problems. Having military once again clearly focused on military objectives, with the enemy of front of them for a change would be a tremendous morale boost. \n \n That morale boost is critical, as we are not only not meeting recruitment goals each month, we are alienating the guys that are going for more than one or two tours of combat that are bearing the brunt of lack of new troops. They are the ones that develop the needed \"professional\" attitude and provide leadership in the trenches where it counts the most. The current trend is that the military is losing these people.",
