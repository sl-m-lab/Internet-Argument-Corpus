   "Would you feel safer if toy guns were taken away and children playing games were treated like criminals. The Airline Security thing also seems to laed to my POV. I am sure that everyone on that flight were made a lot safer becuase G.I. Joe was disarmed. Why didnt they arrest G.I. Joe for trying to haul a weapon on board the plane? This idea has had no hand in doing anything good what so ever. Name one incedent that you would like to see common place here in America. I honestly think that the security official who did that was stupid, oh and 40% of fake bombs and weapons get through during routine test but thank God that they stopped that gun-toting G.I. Joe. That is a load off.\n \n <UnGodly ammounts of Sarcasm<",

Toy guns confuse small children and confuse reality and play. I do not want my small children to equate play with real firearms.\n \n I'd rather give them a real firearm and teach them how the have fun under supervison and how to manage themselves when they are around a firearm with no supervision. I would want kids to find an adult or aviod a firearm with no supervision.\n \n But for heavens sake, they do not need to be against the law.",

You're the one that said you wouldn't let your children play with toy guns because you're afraid that your children wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a real gun and a toy gun. Blindone never advocated toy gun-control. On the contrary, Blindone was pointing out that toy guns don't harm children.\n \n And if your children can't tell the difference between fantasy and reality how do you expect them to handle a gun responsibly?

If they are old enough to play with a toy gun they are old enough to be told that it's not real and if you see a gun not to touch it, I mean I was taught that when I was 3 for christ sake, and guess what, I haven't seen a gun without the owner like 2 feet away since, now I understand that you are afraid your kid may find a gun and play with it.\n \n Now if you are afraid of your kid picking up a gun and playing with it then dude you need to get rid of everything small in your house, not let them watch TV, get rid of everything sharp (they might think they are a ninja) and so forth, cause everything can be considered a toy. When I have kids I will let them play with toy guns, but nothing that looks too real. Haven't you ever played guns?",
