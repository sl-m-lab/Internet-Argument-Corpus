   "Have any of you seen this? \n \n HILLSBORO -- A Portland lawyer says suffering by African Americans at the hands of slave owners is to blame in the death of a 2-year-old Beaverton boy. \n Randall Vogt is offering the untested theory, called post traumatic slave syndrome, in his defense of Isaac Cortez Bynum, who is charged with murder by abuse in the June 30 death of his son, Ryshawn Lamar Bynum. Vogt says he will argue -- \"in a general way\" -- that masters beat slaves, so Bynum was justified in beating his son. \n The slave theory is the work of Joy DeGruy-Leary, an assistant professor in the Portland State University Graduate School of Social Work. It is not listed by psychiatrists or the courts as an accepted disorder, and some experts said they had never heard of it. \n DeGruy-Leary testified this month in Washington County Circuit Court that African Americans today are affected by past centuries of U.S. slavery because the original slaves were never treated for the trauma of losing their homes; seeing relatives whipped, raped and killed; and being subjugated by whites. \n Because African Americans as a class never got a chance to heal and today still face racism, oppression and societal inequality, they suffer from multigenerational trauma, says DeGruy-Leary, who is African American. Self-destructive, violent or aggressive behavior often results, she says. \n Noting the theory has not been proven or ever offered in court, Washington County Circuit Judge Nancy W. Campbell recently threw out DeGruy-Leary's pretrial testimony. \n But the judge said she would reconsider the defense for Bynum's September trial if his lawyer can show the slave theory is an accepted mental disorder with a valid scientific basis and specifically applies to this case. \n \"I think it can be proven,\" the court-appointed Vogt said after Campbell's ruling. \"The problem is it's brand new. It's not as easy to present in court as something that's been established over years.\" \n\n \n http://oregonlive.com/search/index.ssf?/base/news/1086004710123410.xml?oregonian?lcg",

Just because your relatives were slaves over 150 years ago does not allow you to beat, rape, or murder someone. That is insane. Being a slave is not genetic; nothing about getting beaten by whites is genetically passes on to further generations.",

   "It&#8217;s nothing new at all. As a matter of fact it has been going on since the dawn of man. Could it be genetic? Some say it could. Some scientists say that bad (immoral, evil, decadent, wicked, corrupt) behavior can have an effect on the natural (biological) makeup of the body and then can be passed along to the next generation. It has to do with the impression they inherit of how usual life should be.\n So, in responding to this I would have to say it&#8217;s a very lame excuse, weak, and without merit. Anyone, no matter how fervent their cause, would be crazy to list it as a syndrome. It has become &#8220;accepted&#8221; as criminal and I believe it will stay that way for a long time.\n \n Now, ask me what I think in the Religion Forum....",

That's what it looks like. The person suing for this obviously doesn't appreciate what living in the US means...they sue over whatever they can to get money.",
