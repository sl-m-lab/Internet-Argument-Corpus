   "I was wondering what everyone's favorite album would be. Any genre works. Any album works (includes soundtracks and compelation albums.) If you made a list of your favorite albums, which would be your number 1 choice? If you have a why, that works also. I'm not looking for a profeshinal answer here. I'm looking for a personal answer.\n \n \n My Number 1 choice would be Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band's Like A Rock.",

   "Tell you all what, let's go ahead and make it your top 2 or 3 favorite albums.\n \n I already said what my favorite album is. My second favorte album would be \n Bruce Springsteen's Born In The U.S.A. I love the songs \"No Surrender\" and \"I'm Goin' Down\".\n \n I would say that my third favorite album would be\n Boston's Corporate America. This one is a little more personal for me. It's kind of a cheesy personal choice but a little personal none the less. I love the song \"I Had A Good Time.\" But beyond that, I became a Boston fan while I was in High School. The album came out the year I graduated high school. Okay, it didn't really come out until the November after I graduated but it was the same calender year.",
