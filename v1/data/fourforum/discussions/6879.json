   "The biblical book of Ezekiel (chapters 26-28) contains detailed prophecies concerning the total and permanent destruction of the island city of Tyre at the hands of king Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon. As it turns out, these prophecies appear to have been a spectacular failure.\n \n Ezekiel's prophecies regarding the fate of Tyre...\n [*]Eze 26:7 For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring upon Tyrus Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, a king of kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and companies, and much people.\n [*]Eze 26:9 And he shall set engines of war against thy walls, and with his axes he shall break down thy towers.\n [*]Eze 26:14 And I will make thee like the top of a rock: thou shalt be a place to spread nets upon; thou shalt be built no more: for I the LORD have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.\n [*]Eze 26:19 For thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall make thee a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I shall bring up the deep upon thee, and great waters shall cover thee;\n [*]Eze 26:21 I will make thee a terror, and thou shalt be no more; though thou be sought for, yet shalt thou never be found again, saith the Lord GOD.\n [*]Eze 27:32 What city is like Tyrus, like the destroyed in the midst of the sea?\n [*]Eze 27:36 thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt be any more.\n Never happened. King Neb besieged the city for 13 years from circa 585 BCE onwards, but was unable to take Tyre. Indeed, the author of Ezekiel later admits to this...\n \n Eze 29:18-19 Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyrus: every head was made bald, and every shoulder was peeled: yet had he no wages, nor his army, for Tyrus, for the service that he had served against it: Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall take her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army.\n \n ...King Neb's troops were paid from what they could plunder from cities which they had conquered. Obviously, since they had failed to take Tyre after 13 years, they had no wages. So, according to Ezekiel, God apparently directed Neb's attention to Egypt as a sort of compensation for his failure to take Tyre. \n \n Apologists have attempted to get around this problem by proposing two rather dubious explanations...\n [*]King Neb did, at least, destroy mainland Tyre\n [*]The prophecy was eventually fulfilled by Alexander the Great\n But these explanations raise more problems than they solve. Tyre was an island city with suburbs on the mainland. Ezekiel refers to these suburbs as Tyre's \"daughters\" (Ez. 26.8). Neb never took Tyre, which Ezekiel describes as a \"rock\" in \"the midst of the sea\". \n \n Claiming that Alexander the Great eventually fulfilled these biblical prophecies is worse than absurd - it borders on the desperate. Although Alexander did sack portions of the city in 332 BCE, it was quickly rebuilt (attested to by the fact that, eighteen years later, the island city withstood for fifteen months a siege by Antigonus, one of Alexander's generals) and continued to prosper under subsequent Seleucid, Roman, and Byzantine rule. Moreover, Ezekiel mentions the failed king Neb by name as the destroyer of Tyre in his prophecies and (as can be expected) makes no mention of Alexander the Great (or anyone else for that matter). Apologists nevertheless cling to the Alexander explanation by pointing to Ezekiel's declaration that Tyre would be attacked by \"many nations\" (Ez 28:7). But Ezekiel, himself, informs us that king Neb of Babylon was a \"king of kings\" (Ez 26:7), implying that Neb ruled over an empire. Indeed, this is confirmed by...\n \n Jer 34:1 The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion, and all the people, fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof\n \n Quotes...\n \n With few exceptions, Tyre has been occupied continuously from the middle of the 3rd millennium B.C. through the Greco-Roman and Byzantine periods. Anchor Bible Dictionary\n \n Ezekiel's predictions that Tyre would fall never came true; at a later date he transferred the judgement against Tyre to Egypt.

   "Re: The Bible Unearthed, Finkelstein & Silberman, Free Press Pub.\n \n These two authors, one an archeologist and the other a historian, have published a book which draws attention to some striking discrepancies between certain Bible narratives vs. recent archeological and historical findings. By recent, I mean within the last hundred years. \n \n Israel Finkelstein - Director of the Institute of Archeology at Tel Aviv University.\n \n Neil Asher Silberman - Director of historical interpretation for the Ename Center for Public Archeology in Belgium and a contributing editor to Archeology magazine.\n \n The book of Exodus describes the labours of Hebrew slaves in Egypt, their eventual liberation at the hand of Moses, and the subsequent wanderings of these people in Sinai for forty years. Does this story reflect historical reality? Can we find extra-biblical and/or archeological evidence in support of this story? \n \n First, let's establish the time frame. The biblical account in 1 Kings 6:1 dates the Exodus to about 1440 BCE in the Late Bronze age (LB). Right away, problems crop up. Exodus 1:11 tells us that the Hebrews were forced to construct the city of Raamses, but the first pharaoh with that name came to the throne in 1320 BCE, more than a century after the biblical date of the Exodus. Also, despite the fact that the ancient Egyptians kept good records, there exists no Egyptian record of a concentration of Hebrews living in the eastern delta, as implied by Genesis 47:27. Indeed, there are no Egyptian records relating to an extensive Hebrew presence in Egypt at all. Furthermore, during this time period (LB), Egypt was in control not only of the Sinai, but of Canaan, as well. Egypt had fortifications throughout the entire region, extending as far north as the border with what is now Syria, making it unlikely that a large group of Hebrews could have entered the region without meeting Egyptian opposition.\n \n According to the Exodus account (12:37-38), the freed Hebrews numbered almost two million (600 thousand men as well as women, children, and the elderly, not to mention cattle, sheep, etc.), and wandered in the Sinai for forty years. However, archeologists have been unable to uncover a single campsite or sign of occupation within the Sinai during this (LB) period - no pot sherds, no bones, no encampements, nothing. \n \n The Bible (Deut. 1:46, 2:14) tells us that these Hebrews spent a considerable amount of time (perhaps 38 out of 40 years) encamped in and around Kadesh-barnea in the Sinai. The location of this site is set in Num. 34. Repeated excavations within this area have not provided the slightest evidence of occupation during the LB. Ezion-geber is another such site identified in the Bible, and again, no trace of LB occupation has been discovered. \n \n What does this tell us? It suggests that the dates and places mentioned in the Exodus story do not relate to the time of the Exodus as given in the Bible. Quoting from the authors...\n \n The most evocative and consistent geographical details of the Exodus story come from the seventh century BCE, during the great era of the prosperity of the kingdom of Judah - six centuries after the events of the Exodus were supposed to have taken place. All of the major places that play a role in the story of the wandering of the Israelites were inhabited in the seventh century; in some cases they were occupied only at that time.\n \n The Bible tells us that Moses sent agents from Kadesh-barnea to the king of Edom to ask permission to pass through the country on the way to Canaan (Num 20:14-21). The king refused. Archeological investigations suggest that Edom reached statehood only under Assyrian rule sometime in the seventh century BCE. Before that, it was a backwater. \n \n Again, this seventh century era keeps popping up in archeological and historical investigations. But by this time, Judah was already established as an Israelite settlement. \n \n I claim no expertise in this subject, but I find the research to be fascinating.",

   "Exposing Orion's Minimalist Finkelstein & Company\n \n Finkelstein's and Silberman's argument that the accounts of the Patriarchs and Exodus were committed to writing during the reign of Josiah is hard to swallow. Orion's \"E document\" (The Elohist source that the Documentary Hypothesis folks date to 850 B.C.), contains Patriarchal and Exodus traditions of much earlier periods. Consequently, either Orion's Documentary Hypothesis is screwed or his hero Finkelstein is a fool. \n \n Dr. Lawrence Stager is Dorot Professor of the Archaeology of Israel in the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Cultures at Harvard University. He supervises excavations at the site of Ashkelon in Israel and is the author, with Philip King, of Life in Biblical Israel. \n \n Finkelstein, an archeologist at Tel Aviv University whose work - Harper's never mentions this - has been emphatically put down by other archeologists, including archeologists on the left wing of the debate. \"Not a single senior archaeologist has come out in support\" of Finkelstein's primary methodology, while many leading scholars have rejected it, writes Herschel Shanks, the extremely well-credentialed editor of Biblical Archeology Review,the essential journal of scholarly debate on the historicity of scripture. The kind of pseudo-analysis touted in the new Harper's was recently denounced at a meeting of the Biblical Archeological Society - the leading scholarly organization in the field, often criticized by organized religion because it is broadly liberal - as \"Biblical nihilism\" composed of \"ideological cant, not scholarship.\" \n \n http://www.beliefnet.com/story/103/story_10346.html\n \n 20] In assessing the current debate, we have already raised a number of points which do not favor Finkelstein's assertion that his alternative approach to the chronology of Iron Age Israel is \"no less appealing and historically sound than the generally accepted one\" (1996: 178). First, his efforts appear to be tainted by the self-appointed \"quest to emancipate Iron Age archaeology from biblical archaeology\" (1998: 167), which does not hinder him from finding biblical support for such events as the destruction of Jezreel or choosing selectively among various Aramaean activities mentioned in the Bible. In fact, at times it appears that Finkelstein is being driven more by his own conclusions than by a methodologically sound interest in building upon a growing body of evidence. In light of the efforts of the Copenhagen school and others in making use (albeit selective) of the findings of archaeology in supporting their claims about the nature of the United Monarchy, one may appreciate the irony of Mazar's recent observation that perhaps Finkelstein's interpretation of the data has been \"inspired by some current trends in historical writing\" (164).\n \n 1. [21] Another critique of the Low Chronology, then, is that it appears to be based on a very narrow consideration of available data. Drawing assumptions about Philistine pottery by focusing on a few southern sites, Finkelstein ignores the presence of boldly demarcated pottery distribution elsewhere. Mazar cites as example the large quantity of Bichrome ware recovered at Megiddo Stratum VIA, but lacking at a contemporaneous level at Beth Shan (S-2) (158). Moreover, it seems naive to suppose, as Finkelstein apparently does, that pottery use and development would be sequentially uniform across a broad area and that clearly defined socio-political and cultural boundaries would not result in variations in the type and useful life of daily pottery.\n \n [22] Next, the resulting shift in the chronology of corresponding strata at other sites creates more problems than it solves. In order to maintain the proposed chronology Finkelstein is forced to stamp out fires; those he cannot stamp out are simply ignored. Case in point, Arad Stratum XII, which Finkelstein accepts as being the city conquered by Shoshenq I ca. 925 BCE yields pottery assemblages contemporaneous with those of southern sites such as Qasile IX-VII, Lachish V, Batash IV, and others, which the Low Chronology scheme has pushed forward into the ninth century BCE (Mazar: 161). It makes more sense to retain the correspondence of these other sites, tied as they are to the reasonably firm anchor of Arad XII. Finally, Finkelstein's assertion that the Low Chronology closes an apparent gap in the ninth-century BCE stratigraphy of the south appears to be nothing more than a solution in search of a problem, as the \"thin stratigraphy\" of this period is reasonably attributed to a continuation in the use of pottery and not a missing century at all, as Mazar points out (163).\n \n http://moses.creighton.edu/JRS/2001/2001-7.html",

Numerous Bible authors confirm King David, Solomon, Jerusalem, and all the other fixings prior to Finkelstein's dating. We also have more demolitions below to decimate your minimalism:\n \n Who Destroyed Megiddo? Was It David or Shishak?\n \n \n http://www.bib-arch.org/bswb_BAR/bswbba2906f1.html\n \n \n http://www.accuracyingenesis.com/solomon.html\n \n C14 dating affirms Scripture/Scripture affirms C14 dating!\n \n Deep in the ruins of a Hebrew town sacked nearly 3,000 years ago by an Egyptian Pharaoh, scientists say they have discovered new evidence for the real-life existence of the Bible's legendary kingdoms of David and Solomon. \n \n The evidence refutes recent claims by other researchers who insist that the biblical monarchs were merely mythic characters, created by scholars and scribes of antiquity who made up the tales long after the events to buttress their own morality lessons. \n \n The debate, however, is not likely to subside, for archaeology is a field notable for its lengthy quarrels among partisans, however scientific they may be.\n \n The latest evidence comes from Israeli and Dutch archaeologists and physicists after seven years of digging at a historic site called Tel Rehov. The site is in the Jordan valley of Israel, where successive settlements rose and fell over the centuries.\n \n Using highly sophisticated techniques for establishing dates through the decay rate of radioactive carbon, the scientists have pinned down the time of a disputed moment in history, recorded in the Bible, when a Pharaoh now known as Shoshenq I invaded Jerusalem. \n \n As the book of Chronicles relates in the Old Testament, Shoshenq (the Bible called him Shishak) came \"with twelve hundred chariots and threescore thousand horsemen\" and plundered Israel's capital, as well as such towns and fortresses as Rehov, Megiddo and Hazor. \n \n The Pharaoh later listed those conquests on a monument in the temple of Amun at Karnak, where the Egyptian city of Luxor now stands. \n \n The new timetable places Shoshenq's rampage and looting at Rehov in the 10th century rather than the 9th, a highly significant difference. It sets the date at about 925 B.C., some five years after Solomon was said to have died, and some 80 years earlier than other archaeologists maintain. \n \n Those scholars, known in the world of archaeology as \"minimalists,\" insist that both David and Solomon were little more than tribal chieftains, and certainly not the mighty monarchs of the Bible. \n A report on the new evidence appears today in the journal Science by Hendrik Bruins, a desert researcher at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel, Johannes van der Plicht of the Center for Isotope Research at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, and Amihai Mazar of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the principal archaeologist at Tel Rehov. \n \n In a telephone interview, Mazar said that one specific \"layer of destruction\" at the site yielded a harvest of charred grain seeds and olive pits that enabled his colleagues to date them with an unusually high level of precision. The dates of both earlier and later layers showed clearly how the successive layers of occupation could be determined from the 12th through the 9th centuries B.C., he said. \n \n \"They provide a precise archaeological anchor for the united monarchies of the time of David and Solomon,\" Mazar said. \"The pottery we found there also tells us that the conquest dates from the same period as Meggido, when its mighty gates and walls and temples were also destroyed by Shoshenq's armies.\" \n \n More than 40 years ago the late Yigael Yadin, who won fame as an army officer during Israel's war for independence, turned to archaeology and after excavating the imposing ruins at Megiddo maintained that they were in fact destroyed during the so-called Solomonic period. \n Recently, however, a group of archaeologists led by Israel Finkelstein of Tel Aviv University working at Megiddo has insisted that the so-called Solomon's gate there dates from a much later time -- perhaps 100 or even 200 years after Solomon. \n \n Finkelstein read a copy of the Mazar report that was sent him by e-mail. After replying that Mazar \"is a fine scholar,\" he insisted that \"there are many problems with his archaeological data\" and that the samples of material used for the radiocarbon dating are at best questionable. \n In the past, Finkelstein has accused Mazar of harboring a \"sentimental, somewhat romantic approach to the archaeology of the Iron Age,\" according to an earlier account in Science.\n \n On Thursday, however, one of the leaders in the archaeology of Israel, Professor Lawrence E. Stager, who is director of Harvard University's Semitic Museum, dismissed the claims of Finkelstein and the other archaeologists who share his views. \n \n \"Mazar and his colleagues have now put another nail in the coffin of Finkelstein's theories,\" Stager said. \"There's no question that Rehov and the other cities that Shoshenq conquered were indeed there at the time of Solomon. \n \n \"We don't need to rely any more only on the Bible or on Shoshenq's inscriptions at Karnak to establish that Solomon and his kingdom really existed, because we now have the superb evidence of the radiocarbon dates.\" \n \n http://www.accuracyingenesis.com/solomon.html",
