   "This is all hypothetical but if you beleive that jesus turned water into wine, Then if god actually sent you this wine six hours after it was water without telling anyone but you would you be suprised if no scientist would agree that the wine was water 6 hours ago? Why should people care if a scientist disagrees with genesis? Why is the defence that the earth appears billions of years old under some circumstances even though it is not because miracles can mislead someone thinking only about what they can observe?",
