   "600 weapons returned\n By Michael Ruffles\n Monday, 6 October 2003\n \n MORE than 600 weapons were collected by Victoria Police in Ballarat at the weekend under the Federal Government's hand gun buyback scheme.\n The semi-automatic and revolver guns were collected at the Wendouree Sports Complex in Norman St on Friday, Saturday and yesterday.\n The six-month buyback began in July after being announced late last year.\n More than 500 types of hand guns have been banned under the changes to gun laws that came about after the Monash University shootings last October.\n The Federal Government introduced changes to the gun laws in agreement with the state and territory governments, claiming it would make Australia safer.\n Packing up at 4pm yesterday, venue manager and project officer Leigh Caffyn said the collection in Ballarat went to plan.\n He said between 600 and 650 guns were taken, but he would not know the exact numbers until today or tomorrow.\n \"It all went pretty smoothly,\" he said. \"As far as we're concerned it has been a very successful week.\"\n He said the number of weapons collected was about what the team expected.\n Mr Caffyn said while some gun owners were reluctant to part with their registered and legally-bought weapons, they had not caused any fuss.\n \"A lot of them were not happy with it, but they were easy to get along with,\" he said.\n Uniform police officers were on standby for security and transportation.\n The weapons were crushed by Victoria Police to render them inoperable.\n They were then taken from Ballarat under police escort, and will be melted down and the metal recycled.\n \"They'll be made into chicken wire - or whatever the recyclers do with it,\" Mr Caffyn said.\n The team is moving around the state, and will be compensating hand gun owners until the end of the year.\n Any hand guns that have been prohibited under changes to the legislation can be returned at any collection centre in Victoria.\n \n \n From some dumb aussie page...\n \n \"\"They'll be made into chicken wire \" is my favorite quote from this...\n \n Keep all those aussie sheeple in line!\n \n I wonder if those \"uniformed stormtroopers\" were armed....\n \n AMD is this what you want here?\n \n \n \n This is tyranny! I'd let them have mine! bullets first!\n \n \n MOLON LABE!",

To think that my precious little boy, 6 years old, had actually held a loaded .22 pushed me right over the edge. I handed the gun to Dorothy. I didn't want to see it again, I said&#8212;get rid of it. The manager made some lame excuse about how he had to have it for self-protection against union members. I didn't reply.\n \n \"Days later Sarah heard a report that the National Rifle Association was pushing a bill known as McClure-Volkmer, which called for the repeal of a Federal gun-control law passed in 1968.\n \n \"Instantly, all the fury that had hit me in the pickup truck came rushing back. I knew the 1968 law well. It was a sensible measure that essentially set age limits for gun buyers, imposed some I inspection and bookkeeping requirements on gun dealers and banned the import of Saturday night specials. I picked up the phone and called the National Rifle Association's Washington headquarters. I said, 'My name is Sarah Brady, and you've never heard of me, but I am going to make it my life's ambition to try to put you out of business.' \"\n The Undefeated - Personal Tragedy, Cancer, Coping and Overcoming Illness : People.com\n\n \n Ah yes dear Sarah who trots around with a .380 in her purse. Well the NRA is still alive and well. As to compromise, repeal all the existing laws on gun control first then we can see about compromise on any new proposal. The big problem with comproise the slavers like Gallileo never stop. How are those gun free zones working out any way?",
