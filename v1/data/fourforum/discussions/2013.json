   "The fact is that \"Ethnic-specific\" health studies estimate that \"240,000-325,000 African Americans are HIV positive.\" Even more shocking is the overrepresentation of African American women in the count of HIV positive women in this country. Statistically, even though they only make up about 12-13% of the overall female population in the U.S., 67.4% of all known HIV infected women and 57% of women diagnosed with \"full blown\" AIDS in this country are African American women. Although there has been a decline in AIDS cases in other groups, the rate of HIV infection among African American women continues to increase. AIDS is the most cited reason for death among African American women between ages 25 and 44 (CDC). \n The studies I have read indicate that poverty and the hip hop sub-culture contribute significantly to the epidemic.\n I believe",

Urban areas are more highly concentrated in AIDS cases. When I was doing initial reseach on this subject, I found this website very helpful. http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pubs/facts/afam.htm But still, the rate of infection in urban areas are still disproportionately African American. This has been attributed to poverty, among other factors",

There is also research suggesting that compared to other groups, blacks may be tend to be more vulnerable to the disease for genetic reasons.\n \n Of course other demographic groups have many individuals living with the disease, but the difference in rates is still very striking.

Too much discussion these days that appears to be about the realities of certain social problems is really moral instruction. I am arguing that more information helps us solve problems more effectively. If we only had your statement to base policy on, we would end up wasting a great deal of resources because there is no targeting. In the end, helping people with this disease is ten times more important than concerns over the consequences of telling people sensitive facts. I find today's ultra-sensitive environment very counterproductive. \n \n I also think people are sophisticated enough to handle sensitive facts. My knowledge of the facts of AIDS has never for a second led me to think that I can relax because I'm not in high-risk groups. I am an informed person and know my color and sexual orientation are (obviously) not what prevent me from contracting the disease. I'm sure you fear that stating sensitive facts will lead to stereotyping. I also think people are sophisticated enough that they can be taught the concept of risk. People can learn that to say homosexuals and blacks have higher rates of AIDS is NOT saying AIDS is a gay/black disease, but it is saying that there are differential risks that are helpful to know.",
