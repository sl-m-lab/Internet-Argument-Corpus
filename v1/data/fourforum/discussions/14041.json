Massachusetts was the so called test case for this system which the democrats never hold up as evidence of how good it works. And in order to get right to the crux of your question, here is what is happening in that State as far as costs are concerned, I quote:\n First, it has not achieved universal healthcare, although the reform has been a boon to the private insurance industry. The state has more than 200,000 without coverage, and the count can only go up with rising unemployment.\n \n Second, the reform does not address the problem of insurance being connected to jobs. For individuals, this means their insurance is not continuous if they change or lose jobs. For employers, especially small businesses, health insurance is an expense they can ill afford.\n \n Third, the program is not affordable for many individuals and families. For middle-income people not qualifying for state-subsidized health insurance, costs are too high for even skimpy coverage. For an individual earning $31,213, the cheapest plan can cost $9,872 in premiums and out-of-pocket payments. Low-income residents, previously eligible for free care, have insurance policies requiring unaffordable copayments for office visits and medications.\n \n Fourth, the costs of the reform for the state have been formidable. Spending for the Commonwealth Care subsidized program has doubled, from $630 million in 2007 to an estimated $1.3 billion for 2009, which is not sustainable.\n \n Fifth, reform does not assure access to care. High-deductible plans that have additional out-of-pocket expenses can result in many people not using their insurance when they are sick. In my practice of child and adolescent psychiatry, a parent told me last week that she had a decrease in her job hours, could not afford the $30 copayment for treatment sessions for her adolescent, and decided to meet much less frequently.\n \n In another case, a divorced mother stopped treatment for her son because the father had changed insurance, leaving them with an unaffordable deductible. And at Cambridge Health Alliance, doctors and nurses have cared for patients who, unable to afford the new copayments, were forced to interrupt care for HIV and even cancers that could be treated with chemotherapy.\n \n Access to care is also affected by the uneven distribution of healthcare dollars between primary and specialty care, and between community hospitals and tertiary care hospitals. Partners HealthCare, which includes two major tertiary care hospitals in Boston, was able to negotiate a secret agreement with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts to be paid 30 percent more for their services than other providers in the state, contributing to an increase in healthcare costs for Massachusetts, which are already the highest per person in the world.

   "The Democrats' proposals would start the complicated but vital task of replacing the system's current incentives, which encourage providers to spend as much as possible, with rewards for wellness, efficiency and high-quality care. By attacking the demand that leads to overconsumption of services, the bills should slow the growth of healthcare costs over the long term.\n \n The House and Senate bills use a combination of approaches to change the way medical services are delivered and paid for, focusing mainly on Medicare (which, after all, truly is a government-run healthcare program). These include numerous demonstration projects that explore ways to better coordinate treatments among doctors, hospitals, pharmacies and other providers; deter medical errors; improve follow-up care; and promote procedures that are more valuable to patients over the long run. Should these projects be deemed successful, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services would have the authority to apply the techniques systemwide without asking Congress for permission.\n \n Cost control's the key - Los Angeles Times\n\n \n Why won't you answer my question?

   "Why does it work in every other OECD country?\n\n \n I am speaking of the plan as a whole, not just the concept that replacing emergency care with preventative/early care would decrease costs. \n \n I don't think that there is any doubt that it is more efficient to provide preventative care/early care than it is to wait until the situation has degenerated to the point that you are in ICU. That is why, for example, my family insurance not only covers the cost of a mammogram 100%, they send my wife a $100 check every time she gets one. IT is cheaper for them in the long run to bribe women to get screened. \n \n IMO the biggest problem with the health care system in the US is that the cost is largely carried by our employers. American businesses are already struggling to be competitive in the world market. I can say with 100% mathematical certainty that if we do not find a way to decrease these costs and get them off our companies backs, they will not be able to remain competitive. It is just too much of a financial burden for them to bear going forward. \n \n Unfortunately the entire debate has been framed primarily by the dishonest and the foolish. You see idiotic references to mythical things like \"free market health care\" and even see some people foolish enough to argue that we currently HAVE free market health care. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n \n I can't even count the number of times that I have seen people argue against health reform because in the UK they have to WAIT to see a doctor. When you point out that studies have shown that waiting times in the US are actually LONGER than those in the UK, they come back with \"But we can CHOOSE\". IF you have to wait for doctor a or doctor b, you are CHOOSING your doctor, you don't get to choose whether or not to wait. \n \n BUT...health reform does not necessarily have to mean single payer, and it CERTAINLY should not mean more insurance.

Lets say that Modulus is not insured. He gets a kidney stone, but cannot afford to go to the doctor. So he takes a bunch of tylenol, advil, and whatever painkillers he can find on the street. \n \n The kidney stone continues to grow until it blocks the flow from that kidney. The kindney swells up until the pain is so bad he cannot take it anymore. He goes to the ER when his kidney finally bursts and he is septic. Emergency surgery. 3 weeks on IV antibiotics. $500,000. HE gets out of the hospital, goes chapter 7. The hospital eats that half million.\n \n Between the 2 of you, per capita health care cost is $252,000 for that year.\n \n Now, scenario 2.\n \n You have an average health care expenditure of $4,000 per year. Modulus is now insured. He gets a kidney stone. He goes to the doctor because it hurts like hell. The doctor visit cost $60. He has a $70 x-ray. They fidn the stone and send him to a urologist, which costs $120. They put in a stent, shove a laser up the end of his willy, and zap that bad boy. Total cost is about $4200 for the procedure. Figure another $120 for pain killers (during the wait for the urologist he is going to need some percocet). Total cost....$4,570\n \n Now your per capita cost is $4,285\n \n That is a very real phenomenon. I know our local hospital actually wrote off more accounts than they collected last year. That means they have to increase prices in order to cover their expenses. \n \n That is why an MRI at our local hospital cost $6800 OR I can go to topeka to a special MRI clinic and it only costs $2400 there. The hospital HAS TO treat everybody who comes through the door and they end up with a bunch of noncollectable accounts. The MRI clinic requires payment in advance. Everybody pays so they dont have to build the cost of the deadbeats into their pricing. \n \n The theory is sound.

   "BUT, how any companies with 50 employees do not already supply health care??\nAbout 65-68% as opposed to 75+% for those over 100 employees. \n \n \n \nHopefully we will see more because I will tell you right now that when I was in business if I could have avoided providing health care for a paltry $2000 per year per employee I would have been on that like white on rice.\nIt's $2,000 per employee (and not per employee subsidized). So if you have 50 employees that is a $100,000 penalty minus a few deductions. Of course this is much better than paying $6,000 per employee for health care insurance...at a minimum (that's about what mine is though). \n \n In short if you are in that 20-30% range of employed with no health care then have fun paying an additional $100,000 you never had to pay. I presume that would mean lower wages for those employees who would now have to buy health care anyway. Either that or just fire whomever is on the subsidy. \n \n either way, all we have discussed is an annoyance for companies to figure out what is the best deal for them which, from what I can tell, has not resulted in anyone being better off..except maybe an insurance company. \n \n Who are we kidding? This plan is designed to get those under a certain poverty level health care. So for that 25 year old making 18k a year working at McDonalds the government will pay $5,000 for the health care and the kid will pay $1k or pay the penalty of $695 or the employer could pay the $2,000 fine or the employer could pick up the $5k or a combination of all of these.
