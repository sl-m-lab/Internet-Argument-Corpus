   "Hi Eddie.Are you suggesting that France withheld it's support of Iraq because of the crisis in 1956?\n\n \n Hi :). \n \n Not really, I`m saying that an ally is not your lapdog. Just because your interest lie in invading Iraq doesn`t mean that France should disregard their own interests and oppinions. \n \n \nI was thinking more along the line of the financial lose they would suffer If the U.S. took control of Iraq,thus making their oil contracts useless.\n\n \n I think the argument that France acted the way they did for economical reasons is just as good as the argument that the US invaded Iraq for economical reasons. Ie; a bad argument.\n \n \n I'm not familiar with the Suez crisis,but I did a little research on it when you mentioned it.You make a good point,although I never heard it mentioned before.The Suez crisis,which happened shortly after WW2,would surely point out just how short a memory they have indeed. emoticon_xgood\n\n \n Hmmm... Perhaps I was a bit unclear :). My point was that the Suez crisis was a good example of how two allies (or three in the Suez case) could have differing interests and act on it through the UN without breaking their alliance.",

   ":)\n \n yes and no\n some allies are also true friends.\n most are business associates.\n\n \n Hmm.. I would say that this is all a sliding scale. Perhaps France is further away from the \"friend\" side and closer to the \"ally\" side (as in military ally) in regard to the US. But to be honest, I don`t think US have that many so far on the \"true friends\" side of things (perhaps UK, Australia and Canada).\n \n And then we must ask, how is the US acting in regard of France (and other countries). Hardly far to the \"true friend\" side. And the Suez crisis showed that even UK couldn`t count on US \"friendship\"...",
