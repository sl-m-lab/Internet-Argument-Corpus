   "You've probably heard how well we are doing in Anbar Iraq, and that its proof we are going to construct a state in Iraq that will work with us on local national interests in their region. I feel its only proper to let some people know the truth.\n \n Iraq's Sunni population being only 20% of the nation is mostly Baathist. They are a secular group that basically controlled Iraq before the war. The issues the Baathists have with AL Qeada was there long before we ever entered Iraq.\n \n I am sure you have heard of the conflicts the baathists had with AL Qeada even before the surge. Now that we are allowing the baathists to Mobilize, they are indeed attacking AL Qeada. Course they are. Its no wonderful moment, they have always wanted to attack them. We are simply allowing them to do it now.\n \n AL Qeada more than any other group in Iraq, needs the presence of U.S. troops keeping the Shia Militias from Mobilizing or they would be crushed in short order. AL Qeada makes its threats knowing that it will harden the U.S. and aid in keeping troops in Iraq so they can continue their infiltration. The American forces prevent any aggression from the Shia Militias and this gives AL Qeada the breathing space it needs to try and build enough force presence to deal with the far larger Shia Militia groups.\n \n If we leave Iraq its true there will be sectarian strife though its note worthy to include that this will mean AL Qeada would be taken out. Currently our stay is effectively aiding our direct enemy and every poll you will ever read makes it clear that the reasons we are staying will never come to being.\n \n If we could guard the borders to Saudi Arabia and Syria, and find a way to fix the differences between the Shia and the United States, then maybe we would have a slight chance of being afforded a long term base. If we could do this, then we could do this in Iran because it is a Shia state. Its clear to me; our chances of ever gaining any real allie in Iraq is very limited if not completely impossible. This means we are only aiding the enemy that actually attacked us on 9-11. Its all it is doing.\n \n Think about this:\n \n They didn't know what would happen when we went into Iraq, yet they know what will happen if we leave?? One thing they have proven, They don't have a clue.\n \n They allowed the Iraq Government to set the expected bench marks because as Bush has said, \"Our help is not open ended!\" Yes actually, it is open ended. If it was limited, we would have left them the 15th time their president went to Iran to talk about us.\n \n Jalal Talabani told the American people; \"Leave if you want, Iran is just fine by us!\" (Basically said). Now, if Iran is fine now, how about when we leave??? Fine then too?? Course...come on.",

And giving in to it just encourages it as it did with the Bush admin. in the end.\n\n \n No. The problem with nules is that the only really hard part is getting the fissionable material. Everything else is relatively easy, and any nation that has mastered the nuclear fuel cycle has the knowledge to produce their own weapons grade material. \n \n This is the real issue in Iran and why we are freaking out despite the fact that we haev no evidence at all...not even the suggestion of a hint of evidence, that they are trying to produce nukes or plan to do so in the future. We do not want them to master their fuel cycle because once they do that, they can produce nukes pretty much any time and there is not a whole lot we can do to stop them. \n \n NK already owned their fuel cycle. The time between us breaking the treaty and them producing the bomb was simply the time it took them to produce the fuel they needed and construct the device. \n \n \n \nBush killed the deal when he realized they had been violating it all along. Bush's great 'calling' out of the 'Axis of Evil' wasn't based on his gut feelings but also on evidence that NK had been defying the deal all along...a fact the previous admin. didn't want to deal with...because eventually, it'd be someone elses problem and dealing with it now (then) would be very problematic and spoil the illusion that you achieved some success.\n Foot dragging on our end happened prior to Bush assuming office and his 2002 speechs on NK.\n\n \n First of all, it has been confirmed by the Bush adminsitration that putting N Korea in the \"axis of evil\" was a move that was literally made hours before the speech was made and NOT because they had anything specific against N korea, but rather because in the original version the Axis of Evil was Iraq, Iran, and Syria, and they felt that they should have a non arab nation in the axis because they did not want it to appear that we were jsut targeting Arabs.\n \n Second, the \"evidence\" that N Korea was violating the deal all along was even less credible than the \"evidence\" of Iraqs WMDs. Bush claimed that our intelligence agencies had uncovered a secret uranium enrichment program. The CIA promptly made a public statement that this is NOT what they had told Bush, but rather that it appeared that N Korea had purchased or built some Uranium handling equipment. \n \n This is a HUGE, HUGE difference. First, N korea already had an enrichment program for power generation, so what Bush was trying to sell was the idea of an enrichment program for weapons. Second, under the Clinton agreement, we were required to build N korea a pair of light water reactors. In order to support these light water reactors one thing that N Korea would have needed is....a whole new uranium handling set up. \n \n \nUnderstandable...but that's appearances. Couple this with how ignorant most of 'the world' is and how most of 'the world' goes on appearances only...and you get your belief system. \n Actually, I wouldn't doubt that the leadership of most of the world knew what was going on, but due to political advantage, sought to allow this appearance to continue.\n \n As for being blowhards...I'd agree with that. \n\n \n And you are are lecturing about conspiracies? the simple fact of the matter is that Clinton made a treaty with N Korea that was logical and workable, and we broke it. Under the terms of the treaty we were to build them 2 light water reactors which were supposed to be operating by 2003. They have not even been started...though N Korea completed the site work and the rest of their portion at great expense to themselves. We kept increasing oil shipments to make up for the fact that we were not meeting our obligations under the treaty. Then we stop the oil shipments.\n \n Now, at that point, N Korea was not in violation of ANY portion of our treaty with them. The IAEA repeatedly said they they could find no evidence of a weapon program. We, on the other hand, had violated EVERY SINGLE one of our commitments under the treaty. \n \n To really top things off, millions of N Koreas were at that point freezing in the dark because without either reactors or oil shipments they were operating under an energy deficit. \n \n So, at that point we had basically COMPLETELY scrapped our treaty with N Korea, so they brought their previously shuttered reactor out of mothballs and fired it up. When they broke the IAEA seals, the US increased military activity in the area and threatened military intervention so the next day N Korea reclaimed their spent fuel rods and started reprocessing them to produce weapons. \n \n This REALLY came back and bit us in the butt when dealing with Iran. We did not want Iran to master a fuel cycle because we were afraid that they might produce weapons in the future....despite no evidence of this. So,w e promised Iran light water reactors and financial aid in return for control of their fuel cycle. Basically we promised them the EXACT same thing we promised N Korea. Then we are SHOCKED that Iran is not willing to trust us with their energy security. \n \n Do you think that MAYBE the fact that we had just completely reneged on an identical deal with N Korea had something to do with their refusal to be \"reasonable\"??",

   "I'm the kinda guy that likes straight forward talk, and don't lie to me thinking the end justifies the means.\n \n A Good example is Iraq. Anyone can see AL Qeada can't stand a chance in Iraq with neighboring Shia groups wanting to mobilize and pound them into another world. The group is far to small to make a difference being that close to Iran. If the reason is: We don't want Iran having Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Ok; that I can understand because thats real. But lets be honest. If your not honest you'll lose the support of reasoning people.\n \n IF we can't be honest, then we can't address the real issues. An Example would be; Is it reasonable for the United States to control the Middle East? If it addresses liberty for all.. I could come on board. Really really. But come on! I don't see liberty where we're shelling, I see set backs to womens rights and even Christians getting free worship. Lets open the doors to real dialog!",
