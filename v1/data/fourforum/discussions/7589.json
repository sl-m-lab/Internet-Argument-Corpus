   "Germany's first female chancellor Angela Merkel has positively laid a course for Kiev having Washington in view. It is common knowledge that George Bush suggested Merkel conforming neighbors of Ukraine - Poland and other Baltic states. In principle, this would be all fine but for one thing - Berlin is supposed to be dragging Ukrainian economy out of stagnation, and Ukrainian multibillion gas debts to come upon Germany. What does Germany gain of this? I reckon that absolutely nothing! We will only be charged for pseudo-democratic \"orange\" forces staying in power while Yushchenko with his team of nonentity keeps flaming-out the country lining pockets for Germany's account. I presume that this short-sightedness of Merkel will certainly cost us a fall out with Russia and a loss of a few dozens of billions. Eventually, once Ukraine breaks up into Western and Eastern parts, as being predicted by experts - 'cause Yushchenko enjoys no approval in East Ukraine, Germany will surely be blamed for it. I think the experience of separate existence of the German nation was far too afflictive to invite failure on other states. Please, let me know your opinion.",

   "Germany is going to eventually leave the Ukraine to its own devices. It's relationship to Russia is far more important for Germany's future energy supplies then the Ukraine will ever be. The split of the Ukraine, is something I have heard of before but can see happening as the ethnic Russian regions are going to prefer Russia over Ukrainian stances.",
