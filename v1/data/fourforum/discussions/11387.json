If the former it seems you're making a pretty big assumption. Furthermore, I found this study which says that states with higher gun ownership rates also had higher murder rates:\n \n \"In the 'high gun states,' 21,148 individuals were homicide victims, compared with 7266 in the 'low gun states' (Table 3 ). For every age group of at least 5 years minimum age, people living in the high-gun states were more than 2.5 times more likely than those in the low-gun states to become homicide victims. These results were largely driven by higher rates of gun-related homicide, although rates of non&#8211;gun-related homicide were also somewhat higher in high-gun states. For all age groups, people living in high-gun states were 2.9 times more likely to die in a homicide; they were 4.2 times more likely to die in a gun-related homicide and 1.6 times more likely to die in a non&#8211;gun-related homicide.\"\n http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1447364\n \n In addition, the US has a higher murder rate than most other developed nations that have low gun ownership rates. Are we starting to see a pattern here?",

   "Ooh, I'd forgotten entirely about this thread. The recent data I found was here.\n \n \"Objectives. In this study we explored the association between rates of household firearm ownership and homicide across the United States, by age groups.\n \n Methods. We used cross-sectional time-series data (1988-1997) to estimate the association between rates of household firearm ownership and homicide.\n \n Results. In region- and state-level analyses, a robust association between rates of household firearm ownership and homicide was found. Regionally, the association exists for victims aged 5 to 14 years and those 35 years and older. At the state level, the association exists for every age group over age 5, even after controlling for poverty, urbanization, unemployment, alcohol consumption, and nonlethal violent crime.\n \n Conclusions. Although our study cannot determine causation, we found that in areas where household firearm ownership rates were higher, a disproportionately large number of people died from homicide.\"",
