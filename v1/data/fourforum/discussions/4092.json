Mayer\n \n \n Posted on 05/18/2002 10:40:44 AM PDT by smith288\n \n \n \n Bush Justice Department's stand on gun rights is on target\n \n Saturday, May 18, 2002\n \n \n \n \n Contrary to the assertions of the Tuesday Dispatch editorial \"The NRA way,'' Attorney General John Ashcroft and the U.S. Justice Department are not engaged in a radical \"reinterpretation'' of the Second Amendment by endorsing the view that the right to keep and bear arms belongs to \"the people'' individually and not to the states. \n \n The individual-rights view of the Second Amendment is not peculiar to the National Rifle Association, as the editorial suggested. Rather, it is the correct view, the view held by virtually all constitutional scholars throughout American history. \n \n The two leading constitutional-law commentators of the 19th century, Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story in the early 1800s and Michigan Supreme Court Justice Thomas Cooley in the late 1800s, both took the view that the right belongs to the citizens, not the states. \n \n Indeed, they understood that the text of the Second Amendment means exactly what it says: \"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.'' \n \n The right belongs to the people; it is as individual a right as the Fourth Amendment \"right of the people to be secure . . . against unreasonable searches and seizures'' or the First Amendment \"right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.'' \n \n The reference to the militia only reaffirms the individual-rights view, as UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh has noted in the May 10 Wall Street Journal column \"The Radical Amendment'': \"From the Militia Act of 1792 to the current Militia Act (enacted in 1956), the 'militia' has meant pretty much the adult able-bodied male citizenry age 17 to 45. After the Supreme Court's sex equality decisions of the 1970s, it almost certainly includes women, too. \n \n \"The two clauses (of the Second Amendment) both stress the Framers' commitment to keeping the citizenry -- not the states or small state-selected groups -- armed.'' \n \n A virtual consensus of constitutional historians and legal scholars today -- including not only conservatives, but also such left- liberals as Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe and libertarians, such as Boston University law professor Randy Barnett -- agree that the individual-rights view, not the states'-rights view, is the correct interpretation of the Second Amendment. \n \n The aberration is not the Bush Justice Department but rather the U.S. Supreme Court, which in its 1939 decision in United States vs. Miller held that the Second Amendment right extends only to arms that are related to the militia. \n \n In following the states'-right view suggested by the Miller decision, federal courts over the past 60 years have perpetuated an erroneous interpretation of the Constitution from an era in which the U.S. Supreme Court was notoriously insensitive to individual rights. (The infamous Korematsu decision, upholding the Roosevelt administration's order confining Japanese Americans to concentration camps, came just a few years after Miller.) \n \n The Bush Justice Department may be going against the views of past Justice Departments and of most federal courts of appeals, which have endorsed the states'-rights view of the Second Amendment. But as Volokh noted, \"Attorney General Ashcroft and Solicitor General Olson are hardly promoting their personal views. They're promoting the views of the Framers, and of the American legal system throughout most of American history.'' \n \n David N.

   "Good article\n \n I would disagree that the miller decision is necessarily an abberation in regards to the individual right view. In the Miller case, the court essentially ruled that the second ammendment does indeed convey an individual right, but that the right in question is dependant on the type of weapon (i.e must be suitable for military use). \n \n This was, I believe, not so much a case of mis-interpetation, but one of judicial misconduct. From the decision, it seems likely that the Supreme court was well aware of the fact that the weapon was protected, but they wanted to see miller go to jail, so they found a legal hair to split, then remanded the case back tot he lower court, knowing full well that miller was gone and the case would never be heard.\n \n This is why it is important to have for judges men of integrity. Miller was a slimeball. The world was probably a better place with him in prison. That doesnt change the fact that he should have been found not guilty and released. It take a man of great integrity to turn a child molester, or a murderer, or just a bad guy, loose because his rights were violated or the particular offense for which he was arrested was a constitutionally protectedd activity.\n \n I think the miller decisionw as the result of a shift in judicial dogma. Prior to WWI, many judges seemed to see themselves as part of the citezenry, and ally against the government. It was believed that the courts primary purpose was to ensure that the government was unable to treat its people unfairly.\n \n The new model seems to put the courts and the judges squarely on the side of the government and against the common man. We see more and more of these slimy decisions coming out of court, where circular logic is used as justification for keeping somebody imprisoned or the finest of hairs is split in order to keep the bad guy locked away. This is not the way our system was meant to work.",

   "Daewoo,\n \n \n The Miller decision only came about because Miller did not show up right?\n\n \n If miller had been there, I suppose there is a possibility that he would have argued during the course of the case that the shotgun in question was militarily useful (miller was, after all, a vet, and would have seen sawed off shotguns used fairly extensively in trench warfare during WWI).\n \n Realistically, he probably would not have thought to make such an argument, and the case would have ended the same. Of course, witht he lower court ordered to reconsider their verdict based on the definition handed down by the supreme court, miller THEN would have had the opportunity to argue that the shotgun was a militarily useful item and likely would have been released.",
