   "The gene completely collapses:\n \n http://uncommondescent.com/ (link to article can be found here)\n \n just a few quips from the article:\n \n Until recently, the rest of the genome - the murky regions between individual genes - was viewed as occupied by more or less useless glop. Noncoding DNA is the polite term for junk DNA.\n \n But the glop is starting to look like gold. And genes, in a sense, are losing some of their glitter.\n \n \"To our shock and consternation, we're learning how little we know about the parts of the genome that may matter most,\" said Dr. David M. Altshuler \n \n Such findings represent a sea change for a science that has typically put genes at the center of the universe, much as ancient astronomers believed sun and stars revolved around the earth. (Translation: ToE hits the fan.)\n \n \"We're realizing that things happening 'somewhere else' in the genome, not in genes, are playing critical roles\" in sickness and in health, (and evolution) Altshuler said (more fan-hitting)\n \n \n Although biological dogma has held that organisms - whether human or hydrangea - are largely controlled by a tidy collection of independent genes, scientists were aware of other factors. A curious chemical called RNA has been under scrutiny, but usually only as a bit player, a carrier of messages.\n \n These days, RNA is emerging as a superstar, a prime mover and shaker in cellular processes hitherto attributed mainly to genes. Indeed, major research suggests that a primary purpose of junk DNA might be to create various forms of RNA that, in turn act as regulators for protein-coding genes.\n \n \"Instead of running errands, RNA appears to be running the whole show,\" said Isidore Rigoutsos, whoa! Where does that leave genes? Where does that leave ToE, which is a theory about changing allele frequencies over time?\n \n \"The picture that's emerging\" of how living cells actually operate and evolve \"is so immensely more complicated than anyone imagined, it's almost depressing,\" Rigoutsos said. more honesty is good....by why is this depressing?\n \n In June, a consortium of 80 research institutions in North America, Asia, Europe, and Australia completed the first comprehensive effort to plumb all the inner workings of the DNA molecule, not just the genetic portions.\n \n The Encode study shattered the view that genes carry out their labor in relative isolation.\n \n Instead, genes appear to overlap each other and share stretches of molecular code. Moreover, genes and nongenetic DNA appear to work in close, if mysterious, conjunction and also seem to communicate across relatively vast genomic distances in ways not understood.\n \n The gene is intellectually dead. Genetic deteminism is intellectually dead. Materialism is intellectually dead. ToE is intellectually dead -- atheism is intellectually dead. The new genetics highlights a paradigm of organic wholeness. We are not a collection of parts. We are a complex wholes, who are able to engage dynamic transformation upon enviornmental and social changes. We are not genetically determined, we are creators of our own destiny. We are no longer a collection of \"things,\" we are a collective process.\n \n \n http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070904/sc_nm/genes_venter_dc;_ylt=Aql.wuu4NQbXhiQnkHnH7KQPLBIF\n \n WASHINGTON (Reuters) The first detailed map of a man's genes shows the genetic code is even more complex than anyone thought. For instance, science still cannot pinpoint what makes a person's eyes blue\n \n So who exactly is putting their faith in science and why?",

It seems that the more we learn, the more we learn what we don't know. We have known for a long time that much \"junk\" DNA was not actually \"non-coding\". It's really quite old news to now state that, \"OMG! Lots of non-coding DNA is actually translated to RNA.\" But, of course, what is relatively new is that this RNA that this isn't mRNA in that it doesn't encode proteins. What is new is that it may have some sort of regulatory function and thus have some sort of effect on the development of the organism and thus have some role in evolution.\n \n Isn't it exciting that there is still so much that we have to learn about cell function. First there was Mendelian genetics, and then HOX genes, and now regulatory RNA (some of which we have known about for years).\n \n I wonder if I might ask that you please explain how this evidence in any way negates evolutionary theory.

   "how do you like the idea of the genome being operated by \"hidden RNA regulatory system,\" chemist?\n\n \n Actually I like the concept. One thing you fail to note is that the RNA you refer to is actually transcripts from non-protein coding DNA - perhaps from what has been considered junk DNA in part. That of course is the first step by which protein coding genes function and the messenger RNA serves as the template for translation into polypeptides by ribosomes. There has never been any necessity that proteins are the only product derived from DNA sequences. Indeed one of the best contenders for early life forms has and so far as I know is the RNA world concept in which RNA was the original core structure and DNA only arose later on. In part this idea is supported by the retroviruses which carry their genes around in the form of RNA and generate transcripts suitable for DNA based life using a viral reverse transcriptase.\n \n Given the ability of RNA and DNA to interact and the possibility of modulation the expression of the RNA transcripts (and their fairly high rate of turnover) RNA is a good candidate as a control signal for the expression of other genes either in groups or singularly. The two structures are capable of exhibiting very selective interactions and this means that transmitters of signals can selectively be read by recipients by tuning the sequence of what amounts to the \"messenger\" RNA - why should the organism take the energy penalty of making a protein from the RNA to do the same - protein synthesis is quite expensive energetically. Indeed making protein requires the synthesis of transfer RNAs - a different one for each amino acid which carries a complemetary triplet sequence for recognition by messanger RNA as well as a means of activating a bound amino acid. \n \n I would also point out that ribozymes have long been studied. These are RNA sequences which exhibit enzymatic properties. Again such structures may be older mechanisms than protein based catalysts.\n \n And of course the term \"junk\" has always been a placeholder label for DNA whose function is not known. That does not imply its not knowable and it never has. Its good to see progress being made with regard to its role in biology.\n \n In summary I welcome these findings as they expand our knowledge of the systems and mechanisms which lie at the core of our own existence as organisms.\n \n As to why the scientist in the article expressed depression, thats a reasonable response of a researcher who now finds himself dealing with a more complex system which he is trying to manipulate or understand in depth. The added complexity makes his work just that much more difficult and bogs down the research as new tools will have to be developed to probe the system. As a long time analytical chemist, I know that developing those kind of tools is pretty much our bread and butter and we do like challenges. How do you think it is that automated sequencing of DNA sequences was developed? What kind of chemists do you think developed the tools and techniques sequence the human genome before 2000? For starters you might look up the background of Leroy Hood. I can remember admiring him back in the 1970s when he manged an automated sequencing of dynorphin using only 17 ug of peptide and the existing HPLC technologies of the day, it was quite impressive. Thats not what he is best known for, but it showed what could be done and helped lead him to his development of automated tools supporting the genome project and much much more.\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leroy_Hood",
