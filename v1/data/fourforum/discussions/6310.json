Sometimes the frequency of reporting black criminals depends on the relative number of crimes committed by black people. In a black neighborhood, most all the pictures of criminals will be of black people. This is not a display of media bias.\n \n Would you be black looking for a reason to claim racism...like Jesse Jackson...or did you just ask an honest question?\n \n It sickens me to see looting, too. One looter has shot a policeman in the head. He's the bastard that should be shot...right now...with both barrels...with 00 buckshot...in the face...in front of a white sheet...showing all the blood and brains on CNN...other would-be looters may get the message...a deterrent to future looters!",

Do I think it is \"racial reporting\", no. I think it is reality. You have to take into account the various socioeconomic issues. The majority of the poor in N.O. are black. The poor are more likely to not have had the means to get out of the city, or less likely to leave what little they have. Some of those left in N.O. may have even stayed in anticipation of loosened police control of the city, knowing they would be able to loot and steal at will. But the fact remains, if you watch the coverage, the majority of people stealing and looting are black. If the poor population of N.O. had been predominately white, I would bet you would have seen mostly white looters.",
