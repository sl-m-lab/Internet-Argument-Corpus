   "Project Steve, a list of scientists named Steve in any of its forms (Stephen, Steven, Stephanie, Stefan, Etienne and Esteban) who support evolutionary theory. The count of scientists named Steve is now at 307. About 1% of the population is named steve and therefore, probably about 1% of scientists are named steve.\n \n The 300th Steve was Stephen Hawking:\n \nStephen W. Hawking* \n Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, Cambridge University \n Ph.D., Cosmology, Cambridge University \n Member, Royal Society, National Academy of Sciences; author of A Brief History of Time\n\n For those who might not know it, Isaac Newton was at one time the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge.\n \n These 307 Steves have subscribed to the following statement:\n \nEvolution is a vital, well-supported, unifying principle of the biological sciences, and the scientific evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of the idea that all living things share a common ancestry. Although there are legitimate debates about the patterns and processes of evolution, there is no serious scientific doubt that evolution occurred or that natural selection is a major mechanism in its occurrence. It is scientifically inappropriate and pedagogically irresponsible for creationist pseudoscience, including but not limited to \"intelligent design,\" to be introduced into the science curricula of our nation's public schools. \n\n As the NCSE says in the lead piece,\n \nNCSE's \"Project Steve\" is a tongue-in-cheek parody of a long-standing creationist tradition of amassing lists of \"scientists who doubt evolution\" or \"scientists who dissent from Darwinism.\" \n",
