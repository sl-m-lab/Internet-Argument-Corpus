   "Anyone watch the cult hit series Firefly? No doubt you are all familiar with the summer sci-fi film serenity, based on the series? \n \n Some more info on the series\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_%28television_series%29\n \n A breif summary would say it is an interesting mix sci fi and western, but very character driven and with a slight American Civil War flavour. Very unusual, and very, very good. If you have not seen this already I strongly suggest giving it a try. The series has an unusual way of getting inside yourhead and taking over your mind.",

Now I have seen the first episode and the last. The last episode, Jaynestown, was even more of a western. I think that is why it failed western fans tend not to be scifi fans and vica versa. They could tell the same scifi story without the western. Also it gets a little preachy I don't know many scifi stories that carry a preacher as a member of the crew.",
