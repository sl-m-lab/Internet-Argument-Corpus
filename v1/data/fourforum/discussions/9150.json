   "From the Center for American Progress:\n \n GLUTTONS OF GOLFING, PROSTITUTES, EXPENSIVE MEALS:\n \n FOLEY SCANDAL LUST:\n \n CORPORATE AVARICE: Large corporations and special interests may actually miss the 109th Congress. House Majority Leader John Boehner (R-OH), who pledged to \"lead the effort to bring about the kind of reforms the American people are expecting from Congress,\" has \"raised campaign contributions at a rate of about $10,000 a day since February, surpassing the pace set by former Representative Tom DeLay.\" His biggest donors have included the political action committees of lobbying firms, drug and cigarette makers, banks, health insurers, oil companies, and military contractors. In return, Boehner and other members of the conservative leadership in the House and the Senate have been kind to these special interests, often at the expense of the American public. . . .\n \n THE WRATH OF A CONGRESSMAN SCORNED: Instead of repenting for its sins, the 109th Congress has fiercely gone after its critics and attacked any challengers. Ney has blamed his troubles on the Justice Department, the media, and liberal groups, charging that they have \"savaged\" him and \"engaged in a coordinated smear campaign.\" The right wing, hoping to cover up the conservative leadership's role in concealing the Foley scandal, blamed America's policies of \"tolerance and diversity.\" Hastert simply blamed his staff. More perniciously, the conservative leadership has used its position of power to block congressional investigations. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Pat Roberts (R-KS) -- whose official duty is \"to provide vigilant legislative oversight over the intelligence activities of the United States\" -- has repeatedly reneged on his promise to investigate Iraq pre-war intelligence. . . .\n \n SLOTH 'BY DESIGN': The 109th Congress has arguably done less than the \"Do-Nothing Congress\" of 1948. Congressional analysts Thomas Mann of Brookings and Norm Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute wrote recently, \"[E]ven those of us with strong stomachs are getting indigestion from the farcical end of the 109th Congress. ... With few accomplishments and an overloaded agenda, it is set to finish its tenure with the fewest number of days in session in our lifetimes, falling well below 100 days this year.\" . . .\n \n ENVY OF ABSOLUTE POWER: The conservative leadership of the 109th Congress wanted absolute power and set up a complicated pay-to-play system to obtain and retain it. Most emblematic of this system was the K Street Strategy -- set up by DeLay in 1995 -- which created the culture of corruption in which players like Abramoff and Cunningham flourished. . . .\n \n THE HUBRIS OF INCUMBENCY: In 1994, the right wing gained control over the House of Representatives on the strength of a series of reforms embodied in the so-called \"Contract with America.\" The contract ostensibly \"aimed to restore the faith and trust of the American people in their government\" and end the \"cycle of scandal and disgrace.\" But a year later, DeLay was already breaching the contract by setting up the K Street Strategy. . . .",
