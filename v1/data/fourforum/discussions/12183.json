Eating more plants caused the development of new structures called cecal valves, designed to slow the passage of food by creating fermentation chambers in the gut, where microbes can break down the difficult to digest portion of plants.

When he selected them further to grow on another sugar (lactulose), he obtained a second series of mutants with a new enzyme that accidentally (in a sense) produced allolactose, the very same chemical signal that is normally used to switch on all of the lac genes. This important development meant that now the cells could switch on synthesis of a cell membrane protein, the lac permease, that speeds the entry of lactose into the cell. Summarizing this work, evolutionary biologist Douglas Futumya wrote:\n \n Thus an entire system of lactose utilization had evolved, consisting of changes in enzyme structure enabling hydrolysis of the substrate; alteration of a regulatory gene so that the enzyme can be synthesized in response to the substrate; and the evolution of an enzyme reaction that induces the permease needed for the entry of the substrate. One could not wish for a batter demonstration of the neoDarwinian principle that mutation and natural selection in concert are the source of complex adaptations.

(Woodmorappe, 1981, p.46-71. See especially, pp.62 & 67). Furthermore, Glenn R. Morton, a professional geophysicist, has reported that portions of Alaska also contain strata representing all these geologic periods lying in their exact textbook order. (Phone conversation between Edward Babinski and Glenn Morton, as relayed to me.) Sometime later he identified three wells for me in McKenzie County, North Dakota, which had penetrated all the geologic periods in their correct order. Morton also indicated that the East China Sea, the Juixi (pronounced jewshi) basin in China and many more areas could be added to the list. So, the geologic column definitely does exist! That is to say, there are a number of locations where every period of the geologic column from the Cambrian on up is present and in proper order.

That's what Barbarian has described\n \nIt is these kinds of articles that are so transparently silly that really irritate me.\nReally? Why? From what university did you earn your degree in biology?\n \nAn evolutionary mutation of a gene is: a new and useful gene that never b4 existed, bring new body structures and functions that never b4 existed.\nActually, there is no such thing as \"an evolutionary mutation of a gene.\" A mutation is a mutation. For evolution to have occurred requires neither that a mutation be new nor useful and they don't require new structures nor structures.\n \n Here's a little mental exercise for you. At most, a person can have only two alleles for any gene. This would have been the condition of the human race 6,000 years ago according to creationists. It would not have been possible for there to be more than 2 alleles for any given gene. Now consider that for every gene in the human genome there is an average of 14 different alleles, sometimes more, sometimes less. Where did all of those alleles come from?\n \nSwitching genes on and off is why built in redundancy has generated such a wide variety of creatures in such a wide variety of environments.\nNo its not. That's pretty much babble. The ability to switch genes on and off that comes about is an example of a new function that didn't exist. That's what you asked for.\n \n So why not explain what you mean by built in redundancy and how that \"generated\" the millions of species we see with all of the diversity shown in each species? Are you making that up just to avoid the fact of evolution?\n \nThere has NEVER been 1 example of a newly created gene that provided a new beneficial function based entirely on new information forming on the gene.\nSure there has. You have been given several, like the ability to metabolize nylon.\n \nThe mutations are ALWAYS a net loss of information and as the genetic load continues\nHow can you tell? Please define information in a way that is meaningful in discussions of genetics. Suppose you have a lineage of organisms as follows: A -< B -< C. Suppose that the difference between A & B is a single point mutation and that the difference between B & C is also a single point mutation. Your assertion is that as a result B genome would contain less information than A, and that C genome would contain less information than B, and that therefore C genome would contain less information than A. Now suppose that the mutation between B and C exactly reverses the mutation between A and B. Thus, by your rule, even though the genome of C is identical to that of A, C still has less information.\n \n- eventually all life will morphidite and die out.\nWhat?

And all of those doctors that I know who have encountered infections that don't respond to certain antibiotics and have to use at least one more are all part of this vast conspiracy to frighten ignorant creationists?

   "So now the definition of evolution is 'pre-existing genes switching on and off as needed for various environments?'\n\n \n No, it's about new alleles being produced by mutation. The genes in question didn't exist before; they mutated from existing ones. That's how it works in evolution. New things are made by modifying old things. \"Switching on genes\" is an entirely different thing.\n \n \nAn evolutionary mutation of a gene is: a new and useful gene that never b4 existed, bring new body structures and functions that never b4 existed.\n\n \n Yep. That's what it was. A new and useful gene that never before existed. The \"new body part\" thing has nothing whatever to do with science. However, I did link you to a directly observed evolution of a new body part in lizards.\n \n \nSwitching genes on and off is why built in redundancy has generated such a wide variety of creatures in such a wide variety of environments.\n\n \n Nope. You see, each organism can have only two alleles for each locus. So an original pair (say humans) could have only started with four alleles at most. All the rest must have evolved by mutation.\n \n \nThere has NEVER been 1 example of a newly created gene that provided a new beneficial function based entirely on new information forming on the gene.\n\n \n The nylon gene is a pretty good example, because we know precisely the mutation that produced it. Never existed before. Would you like to know about some more?\n \n \nThe mutations are ALWAYS a net loss of information \n\n \n No. A mutation will always increase the amount of information in a population. If you doubt this, let's see your numbers. I'll be pleased to show you mine.\n \n BTW, it's very easy to show the evolution of antibiotic resistance.

As a result, those groups of birds, such as parrots, doves and owls, that are united by distinct morphological characteristics seem to have appeared suddenly because there are few, or no, known evolutionary intermediates that provide clues to their deeper relationships with other avian groups.\n Hi SD, in truth, the conclusions the article comes to are much bolder than the evidence reveals. Although it say's below that there are few, or no, known evolutionary intermediates that provide clues to their deeper relationships with other avian groups, What bothers me is how limited this study is based on the potential pool of genetic samples that could and should be tested before coming to any hard conclusions. But I can accept that this is a very limited study even though the paper say's it's the largest of its kind done on any animal group. Here's what I mean specifically in this quote:\n \n Let me quote the source:\n To do this work, the Early Bird group examined 19 independent loci consisting of 32 kilobases of nuclear DNA sequence obtained from 169 avian species representing all major groups of birds alive today. These nuclear loci included introns (74%), exons (coding regions, or \"genes\") (23%), and untranslated regions (UTRs) (3%) across 15 different chromosomes (according to the chicken genome). These DNA sequence data were subjected to multiple statistal analyses that produced a robust phylogeny\n Note the bolded: Although that appears impressive, since they found such diversity, and so many genetic surprises in a 169 species, there are around 10,000 different species of birds on this planet. And I realize that when these scientists picked the 169 species to be tested, they believed their choices represented all major groups needed to get a good cross section of species, correct? But look at the results they got. They are completely unexpected and do not reflect the genetic relationships they were expecting at all. Let me give you another quote and another example of how little they still know.\n For example, contrary to conventional thinking, the colorful, daytime hummingbirds are a specialized subgroup of the drably colored nocturnal or crepuscular nightjars; falcons are not closely related to hawks and eagles; flighted tinamous arose from the flightless rheas and ostriches; and tropicbirds are not closely related to pelicans and other waterbirds.\n \n Shorebirds are not a basal evolutionary group, which refutes the widely held view that shorebirds gave rise to all modern birds.\n Note the bolded once again: You notice they tell us which expected bird species the falcon is NOT related to, but they don't answer the question of which species they are related to. I would expect them to take a positive approach but there are gaps in what this study has revealed. They do say that Falcons are sister group to parrots and songbirds, both of which are not carnivores. But that still doesn't answer which group they did adapt from.\n \n So although this studies results are revealing and impressive in the unexpected diversity it showed, much more needs to be done in order to come to conclusions which fill the gaps which the study reveals. In other words, I think it raises more questions than it answers. \n \n Living the Scientific Life (Scientist, Interrupted): Early Birds Shake Up Avian Tree of Life",

   "Are you saying the popular media lied!!!! I am shocked!!! \n No, you lied about what Al Gore said.\n \n \n\n I know what I heard and I am sticking to that. \n So even though the evidence of what was actually said is before you, you are going to stick to the lie you made up.......\n \n \nThe popular media is Chicken Little and they are responsible for what I heard along with thousands of others. \n So even though you just saw that what you claim you heard was wrong, you are going to first blame the \"popular media\" and SECOND \"STICK TO THAT (the lie)\"? !?!?!?!?!\n \n \nNobody listens to Algore speeches so the popular media sums it up for mass consumption. \n Ah, another lie.\n \n So, nobody listenst to Al Gore's speeches, huh?\n \n Well then what about this: An Inconvenient Rush: Thousands out of luck as Gore sells out in minutes\n \nOverwhelming demand for tickets crashed the University of Toronto's UofTtix sales website yesterday when it received 23,000 hits in three minutes.\n \n Thousands of would-be buyers were left empty-handed, including some who began lining up at the box office at 8:30 a.m. for a total of 900 tickets that were to go on sale at 11. \n \n \"We got inundated with calls and with people, and people trying to buy over the Web,\" box office attendant Kara Dymond said.\n \n The hot event? \n \n Not a rock concert, but a speech about the environment given by a retired politician who's been getting the rock star treatment ever since his slideshow documentary hit the big screen. \n \n The Feb. 21 lecture at the 1,500-seat Convocation Hall will be given by former U.S. vice-president Al Gore, author of An Inconvenient Truth and star of a film of the same title on global warming.\n \n \"I think it's safe to say that Mr. Gore is quite possibly the hottest ticket in North America right now,\" said Ruta Pocius, spokesperson for the event and for a one-day symposium the same day.\n \n Six hundred tickets were not publicly released but went to VIPs, Pocius said. Of the 900 that went on sale, 500 were sold to people also attending the symposium and 400 to people only wanting to hear Gore.\n \n A month ago, Gore was scheduled to give a speech in Boise, Idaho. \n \n \"The 1,200 tickets sold out in a few minutes,\" said Dylan Malone, part of a group attached to the fan website Home | Al Gore 2008 Draft Campaign and attempting to draft Gore for the 2008 presidential election.\n \n \"They moved it to a bigger venue, the Taco Bell basketball arena, and sold all 10,000 tickets in about 90 minutes,\" Malone said by phone from Washington.\n \n \n\n Seems an awful strange occurence for someone who has no one that wants to listen to his speeches.... For people that don't want to hear his speeches, they sure are buying tickets to them purdy darned quick...... or someone lied with the claim that noone wanted to listen to his speeches........ hmmmmmm.........",

   "Why do so many creationist always avoid the topic and instead go in another direction? If all anyone can do is avoid a topic why comment in the first place.\n\n \n For this topic it's simple. Creationists are barred by their belief from getting educations. As soon as a creationist gets an education, they cease to be creationists. Therefore, they cannot answer the question here because they don't understand what evolution is and thus cannot provide examples of things that would cause them to abandon creationism. \n \n Second, creationism in the YEC flavor has no evidence. It cannot be argued on its own merits. In the last 10 pages, there are 250 threads. Not a single one has a creationist arguing why YEC is correct on YEC's merits. In virtually every thread here, creationists immediately try to change the subject away from YEC's massive failures to why evolution or some strawman of theirs is wrong. The first post in the \"Flood - scientifically possible\" thread by a creationist attempted to do just that. \n \n Creationism cannot be argued on its own merits. Even supersport admitted there is no evidence for it. Therefore they rely on a false dichotomy. If evolution is wrong, therefore YEC. Hence why they never stay on the original subject.",
