   "I was watching a documentary about the Grand Canyon, and it got me to thinking about something. YEC would have you believe it was created during Noah's flood. Now, the canyon is 227 miles long, a mile deep, and averages around 10 miles across. That's approximatly 2500 cubic miles of rock that's been eroded away. My question to YEC's is this: Where did all the rock go? If it was all carved out during the flood, in just a years time, it would have all been dumped in roughly the same spot, and we'd be able to find it. \n \n In case people are having trouble with scale here, we're talking about enough rock to cover all of Rhode Island to a depth of 2 miles . This is alot of rock to have go missing.",

   "The problem with simply creating the Grand Canyon all at once at the beginning, is that the canyon cuts through sedimentary rocks. Even if God had to create the river beds in place, including the Grand Canyon, why not make the entire earth out of igneous bedrock, with the necessary top soil for the plants to grow? Why would a creator create deep layers of rock that look exactly like they have been put into place by known natural processes? The God-as-deceiver argument.\n \n As far as being formed by the receding waters of the great flood, consider this -- there is no way that any amount of flood waters could have created such a nice, neat, deep canyon through solid rock. Flood geologists suppose that the canyon was cut while the rock was still soft mud. But, as you point out Kronus, the canyon is about a mile deep in places -- you try to form any structure out of soft mud with nice straight vertical walls. It ain't gonna be done.",

I used to live in New Mexico and have traveled all over the southwestern desert and never even heard of something so silly. The only time breathing becomes an issue is when you are in places at an altitude higher than you used to (and there are lots of mountains in the southwest) - that can lead to tiredness and even altitude sickness - but the only cure is time and your body getting used to it.\n \n The American southwest is a truly beautiful place.
