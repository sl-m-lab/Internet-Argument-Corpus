   "This is for all those that do not believe in 1 God in one form or another.\n \n I was reading some of the postings on the Creationism vs. Evolution thread and the problem most non-believers seem to have is a lack of proof that God exists. So I'm going to give you some proof.\n \n This is the best 'scientific' proof of Gods existence. the Quran is the first scripture in the history of man kind to hold intrinsic in its Devine nature a mathematical composition that is impossible to mimic by any human being.\n \n This is what you need to know to understand the following facts:\n A. This mathematical system revolves around the prime number 19\n B. The Quran is composed of \"Sura\" that are analogous to chapters\n C. Each Sura has a certain number of \"verses\" in it.\n D. Some Sura have \"initials\" above them whose meanings are not fully understood yet, but they hold significance in this 19 phenomena.\n \n \n Here is a list of some simple facts from the website listed at the bottom of this posting. I urge you to visit this site to get the full understanding and magnitude of these facts. THIS CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE!!!!!\n \n 1. The first verse (1:1),known as \"Basmalah,\" consists of 19 letters.\n 2. The Quran consists of 114 suras (like chapters), which is 19 x 6.\n 3. The total number of verses in the Quran is 6346, or ....19 x 334. [6234 numbered verses & 112 un-numbered verses (Basmalahs) 6234+112 = 6346] Note that 6+3+4+6 =19.\n 4. The Basmalah occurs 114 times, despite its conspicuous absence from Sura 9 (it occurs twice in Sura 27) & 114= 19x6.\n 5. From the missing Basmalah of Sura 9 to the extra Basmalah of Sura 27, there are precisely 19 suras.\n 6. It follows that the total of the sura numbers from 9 to 27 (9+10+11+12+...+26+27) is 342, or .............19 x 18.\n 7. This total (342) also equals the number of words between the two Basmalahs of Sura 27, and 342 = 19 x 18.\n 8. The famous first revelation (sura 96:1-5) consists of 19 words.\n 9. This 19-worded first revelation consists of 76 letters = 19 x 4.\n 10. Sura 96, first in the chronological sequence, consists of 19 verses.\n 11. This first chronological sura is placed atop the last ..19 suras.\n 12. Sura 96 consists of 304 Arabic letters, and 304 equals .19 x 16.\n 13. The last revelation (Sura 110) consists of ............19 words.\n 14. The first verse of the last revelation (110:1) consists of19 letters.\n 15. 14 different Arabic letters, form 14 different sets of \"Quranic Initials\" (such as A.L.M. of 2:1), and prefix 29 suras. These numbers add up to 14+14+29 = 57 = ......19 x 3.\n 16. The total of the 29 sura numbers where the Quranic Initials occur is 2+3+7+...+50+68 = 822, and 822+14 (14 sets of initials) equals 836, or ................. 19 x 44.\n 17. Between the first initialed sura (Sura 2) and the last initialed sura (Sura 68) there are 38 un-initialed suras 19 x 2.\n 18. Between the first and last initialed sura there are ....19 sets of alternating \"initialed\" and \"un-initialed\" suras.\n 19. The Quran mentions 30 different numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 19, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 99, 100, 200, 300, 1000, 2000, 3000, 5000, 50,000, & 100,000. The sum of these numbers is 162146, which equals 19x8534.\n \n And if you think this is amazing please, PLEASE for your own good, visit the website below where I got all this information from IT WILL BLOW YOUR MIND! God be with you.\n \n http://www.submission.org/math-ap1.html",

Is a divine power required to make this number 19 apparently very common in a work? I see this just as evidence that humans can't help but find patterns in things they observe.\n\n \n \n First of all, the reason this is scientific proof, is because mathematics is a science. And through this science, the Quran has proved its authenticity.\n \n Second, If you are suggesting that anyone can write a book, exibiting this sort of amazing pattern built into the literature, yet at the same time form a coherent and senseble piece of liturature, I'd like to meet this person!\n \n Third, if you think that this pattern just came up randomly, why has it not occured in other extensively studied books, like the bible or tora. Also the fact that this pattern applies all the way down to the occurances of single letters is something luck can not explain. The probability of this being a random occurance is disgustingly low, considering it was written in less than one mans lifetime. I don't think I can fit enough zeros on this webpage to express how low that probability would be.\n \n Fourth, I'm not sure if you checked out the website I posted at the end of my last posting, but there you will see that the 19 pattern extends further than the Quran itself. I also applies to the date this pattern was discovered, in relation to the date the Quran was reveiled. The Website explains that the Quran was reveiled 1406 years before this pattern was discovered in 1974, and yes 19x74=1406\n \n And lastly. It is percisely man kinds ability to find patterns in this chaos we call life that is the foundation of all sciences. If you are a scientist yourself, you should know that science is not a practice of proving things, it is a procedure of supporting theories to explain observations; theres a difference. The Qurans common denominator (19) is just another supporting factor for this book we have observed that claim the existance of God. And just like ceratin experiments greatly support certain theories, the 19 factor strongly supports the Quran and the existance of God.\n \n This time, take sometime out, and really read what this website has to say. Trust me, it will be worth your while.\n \n http://www.submission.org/math-ap1.html",

My point is that nobody can conciously produce such a complex pattern as that seen in the Quran. The 19 frequency occurs at so many levels, and in so many instances that it is impossible of a being of human limitations to manifest. For example the word God (Allah) occurs 2698 times (19x142) in the Quran. Someone would have to mention the word God this many times, yet keep in mind ALL of the other 19 patterns that occur in the Quran at once to be able to creat such a book.\n \n Now think of the greatest mind you've ever known about. Do you think that person has the computational capacity to write a coherent book, yet keep in mind all these patterns?!\n \n If you already haven't check out my first posting that initiated this thread to see the complexity and magnitude of the complexity involved here. Also check the website at the end of that posting for further proof.\n \n Oh and one more thing. The Catholic Church to me is one of the most hippocritical religious group that currently exists.

   "I didn't say infinitely complex...you people on this forum have a thing for exaggerating...\n \n What about the fact that the Quran was written 1400 years ago? was it in the capability of people back then to reason with mathematics like this. Even today, who in this world can hold that much interelated information in their head at once? Frankly, no person has (or had) the cranial capacity to write such a book, not even Einstein. \n \n And you say that there are many examples of complex patterns in literature. That may be true, but I have never heard or seen an example with such intense complexity as the Quran. If you know of another book that exibits a similar and amazing pattern, please share it.\n \n Oh and by the way, the examples TheoMorphic posted eariler in this thread are hardly any comparision to the complexity seen in the Quranmore correct? One more thing, the Quran speaks too much of pain and \n\n \n So what? The New Testament was written in 200 ad and the Old Testament in B.C.\n :xbanghead \n \n If no person has(or had) the cranial capacity to write such a book, then how do we/you know that it is correct? (look at bottom of my message) Mohammed saw terrible things in his dream and wrote it down, doesn't that make sense? Since the Quran just speaks of pain and sorrow. (there is proof of this, I just don't remember maybe someone on 4forums will know and tell you) come on. I've read the Quran, tell me the difference between the Bible and the Quran. Nowhere in the Quran have I seen anything about God's Mercy or forgiveness. The Quran speaks of the Noah's Ark doesn't it? The Bible also does and thats the old testament which was written in B.C. (B.C. Compare that!!) Now which one is correct?. The Bible speaks of mercy and God's love for all of us. And as far as these evolutionists, they are very good at twisting minds and ignoring alot of our arguments about whether God exists. As for patterns in the bible that are similar.. its in the book of revelation, speaks of the Devil's number as 666. If you read on you will see something like sixty 3score and six. There are computer chips coming out sometime in the next 5 years which will be injected somewhere on our bodies(I think foreheads) It will have our social security number and identification and almost everything, my guess is that if you refuse, you will obviously not be able to buy or sell, which was mentioned in the bible. They all have this identicle number to them, something like you divide it by 3 you get 666. (mark of the beast) (other christians will know what I'm talking about) (If your not a christian, look it up. the number for the computer chips is on a .gov site. I will try and look it up again.) This is complex because there is some sort of code in the book of revelation that would tell you who is the antichrist after the rapture takes place. Some posted before a link to this online calculator for finding out who the antichrist is. We know he is supposed to be Romanian. This should be a shut and done deal here anyways. God is not in a physical form. It is spiritual, of course you can't prove that He exists. I can't prove that He doesn't. I probably have some errors on here because i am writing this at school with only 2 minutes left one the clock. TO AMD4EVER AND ANYONE ELSE WITH HIS VIEWS- As for the bible having errors, it is impossible to make a perfect translation of the bible from hebrew to english.. you can't say that the bible has flaws in it just because of the way it was translated. Hopefully Robbie will beable to back me up on this since he is protestant too. \n \n P.S. The last page of the text, Page 372, shows that the total occurrence of the word \"God\" is 2698, or 19x142. The total sum of verse numbers for all verses containing the word \"God\" is 118123, also a multiple of 19 (118123 = 19x6217). Study this carefully, see whats wrong? See the error? tell me when you see the error.\n \n one more thing.. see my name? Jesus is God, They are as one. The Old testament verse speaking of that The Lord our God is the One and Only Lord only justifies this plus the new testament which was spoken from Jesus Christ himself. Plus like I said before, the Old Testament was written way before the Quran was.",

   "This is a quick reply to Lazserus, the rest of you I will reply to once my Biochemistry exam is over on Tuesday Nov. 11th\n \n So, Lazserus...\n First, Einstein was a Jew.\n Second, the pattern I describe of is not simple like your 'o' analogy. My point is that nobody can conciously produce such a complex pattern as that seen in the Quran. The 19 frequency occurs at so many levels, and in so many instances that it is impossible of a being of human limitations to manifest. For example the word God (Allah) occurs 2698 times (19x142) in the Quran. Someone would have to mention the word God this many times, yet keep in mind ALL of the other 19 patterns that occur in the Quran at once to be able to creat such a book.\n \n Now think of the greatest mind you've ever known about. Do you think that person has the computational capacity to write a coherent book, yet keep in mind all these patterns?!\n \n If you already haven't check out my first posting that initiated this thread to see the complexity and magnitude of the complexity involved here. Also check the website at the end of that posting for further proof.\n \n \n Oh and one more thing. The Catholic Church to me is one of the most hippocritical religious group that currently exists. The fact I can't get over is that men rewrote the bible to suit their desires better and those are not the words of God.\n\n \n \n Yes, the catholics did change the bible to suit their needs, im protestant.... those are catholics, it's different... we believe in the same God, but in whole it is because the catholics changed the bible that we seperated. But the Bible unchanged is the Word of God. I know I'm a little late to say this but i think it is worth it. And when are you gonna reply to my other post? \n \n The quran was written way, way, way after the old testament. The Bible in whole was released 200 ad. I know from a Turkish friend that the Quran was written and done AFTER the Bible. He is now a consecutive muslim and believes what his heart tells him. so, what do you think?",

   "First of all, the reason this is scientific proof, is because mathematics is a science.

   "To Crim:\n He was smart enough to know that there is a God.\n \n Einstein stated directly he did not believe in a personal god.\n \n The following information came from Einstein and God and it is interesting to note that he did not say that he believed in a personal God:\n \n Einstein was often asked, \"Do you believe in God?\", to which he sometimes replied \"I believe in Spinoza's God, who reveals himself in the harmony of all being\". \"By God\", Spinoza wrote at the very beginning of his Ethica, \"I mean a being absolutely infinite-that is, a substance consisting in infinite attributes, of which each expresses eternal and infinite essentiality\". Proposition XV of the Ethica stated: \"Whatever is, is in God, and without God nothing can be, or be conceived.\" \n \n Einstein certainly held, as his constant appeal to God showed, that without God nothing can be known, but what did he really mean by his appeal to Spinoza? Once in answer to the question \"Do you believe in the God of Spinoza?\" Einstein replied as follows:\n \n I can't answer with a simple yes or no. I'm not an atheist and I don't think I can call myself a pantheist. We are in the position of a little child entering a huge library filled with books in many different languages. The child knows someone must have written those books. It does not know how. The child dimly suspects a mysterious order in the arrangement of the books but doesn't know what it is. That, it seems to me, is the attitude of even the most intelligent human being toward God. We see a universe marvellously arranged and obeying certain laws, but only dimly understand these laws. Our limited minds cannot grasp the mysterious force that moves the constellations. I am fascinated by Spinoza's pantheism, but admire even more his contributions to modern thought because he is the first philosopher to deal with the soul and the body as one, not two separate things.\"\n \n If you have any time, I would recommend reading the information on that link I sent you, it is quite interesting to read about Einstein's history.",

Isiah says 800ish years before Jesus that \"He [Jesus or the Messiah] was wounded for our transgressions [sins]\".\n * the book's civilizing influence and it's life-transforming message.\n * the book's absolute honesty. I'll extrapolate on this point for a little bit. People have said \"The Bible is not a book that man could write if he would, or would write if he could.\" The Bible does not honour man, but God. The people in the Bible have feet of clay; they are shown \"warts and all\". Against the backdrop of their sinfulness and unfaithfulness, God's holiness and faithfulness shine through. Even the heroes of the faith (Heb. 11 ) have their failures recorded, including Noah (Gen. 9:20-24), Moses (Num. 20:7-12), David (2 Sam.11), Elijah (1 Kings 19) and Peter (Matt. 26:74). On the other hand, the enemies of God's people are often praised - for example, Artaxeres (Neh. 2), Darius the Mede (Dan. 6) and Julius (Acts 27:1-3 ). These are clear indications that the Bible was not written from a human perspective. If it was written by humans, especially when they are the enemy of your people, curses would fill the pages. They would not be talked about so highly.\n \n NOTE: these elements only imply the existence of a creator who made the holy book, like the God of the Bible. You cannot scientifically prove the existence of a creator God, nor can you disprove His existence. However, the God of the Bible says that there is enough design elements in His creation to convince them that there is a God. \n \n Other scientific evidence for the God of the Bible includes:\n * the universal tendency of things to run down and fall apart [2nd Law of Thermodynamics] shows that the universe had to be \"wound up\" at the beginning. It is not eternal. This is totally consistent with \"In the beginning God created teh heaven and the Earth\".\n \n * The changes we see in living things are not the sorts of changes that suggest that the living things themselves came into being by any natural, evolutionary process and evolved over eons of years.\n \n * The fossils do not show the expected transitions from one basic kind of organism to another and is further evidence against the belief that living things evolved over eons of years. Also implies that animals stay true to their kind, as the Bible clearly states.\n \n * Evidence that the universe is relatively \"young\" also contradicts the belief that everything made itself over billions of years. Hence, also implies the Bible's truth by as the Earth was formed relatively recently as opposed to the eons of yearrs stated by evolution, the Bible says that the universe was created about 6,000 years ago.\n \n * Biological evidence collected through mainly the Human Genome Project illustrates the closeness of all human \"races\", i.e. only one \"race\" with many people groups. Hence, shows Genesis is true when it says that we are all \"one blood\" (i.e. came from one man and one woman). \n \n * The explosion in knowledge of the intricate workings of cells and organs has shown that such things as the blood clotting system could not have arisen by a series of accidental changes. \n \n * Design and complexity.\n \n These all imply, if not demand, an intelligent Creator who vastly exceeds our intelligence. Of course, by the very nature of evidence (i.e. it must be intrepreted to make any sense - it does not speak for itself!), it has to be interpreted. An atheist can interpret the same evidence displayed here and, according to what he/she believes, come to a different conclusion. \n \n It all depends on what the person who is evaluating the evidence believes as to what conclusion they will reach. I am a Christian, and as such I look at the evidence and wonder how people can be so blind as to think that everything is an accident; an atheist might think that how can I be so dumb to doubt this evolution that has so much \"evidence\" for it! That is the bad thing about the evidence, it does not speak for itself! \n \n Your \"proof\" is not scientific by any means, all it is at most is mathematical. If you were to give the positions of the planets orbits in our solar system to an astronomer or mathematics guru, they would be able to come up with some form of a relationship between them. Your argument is a similar thing and thus really does not prove the existence of a God as much as you are implying it does. Accurate scientific verses and prophetic lines are much more convincing than a pattern that even occurs in Moby Dick - according to a fellow member's post. There are many other scientific evidences that imply the need for a God.\n \n This whole thread should probably be in the Religion forums as it has very little to do with the whole creation V evolution debate ...\n \n \n References:\n * Stones and Bones ~ Carl Wieland.\n * The Updated and Expanded Answers Book ~ AiG.",

   "This is for all those that do not believe in 1 God in one form or another.\n \n I was reading some of the postings on the Creationism vs. Evolution thread and the problem most non-believers seem to have is a lack of proof that God exists. So I'm going to give you some proof.\n \n This is the best 'scientific' proof of Gods existence. the Quran is the first scripture in the history of man kind to hold intrinsic in its Devine nature a mathematical composition that is impossible to mimic by any human being.\n \n This is what you need to know to understand the following facts:\n A. This mathematical system revolves around the prime number 19\n B. The Quran is composed of \"Sura\" that are analogous to chapters\n C. Each Sura has a certain number of \"verses\" in it.\n D. Some Sura have \"initials\" above them whose meanings are not fully understood yet, but they hold significance in this 19 phenomena.\n \n \n Here is a list of some simple facts from the website listed at the bottom of this posting. I urge you to visit this site to get the full understanding and magnitude of these facts. THIS CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE!!!!!\n \n 1. The first verse (1:1),known as \"Basmalah,\" consists of 19 letters.\n 2. The Quran consists of 114 suras (like chapters), which is 19 x 6.\n 3. The total number of verses in the Quran is 6346, or ....19 x 334. [6234 numbered verses & 112 un-numbered verses (Basmalahs) 6234+112 = 6346] Note that 6+3+4+6 =19.\n 4. The Basmalah occurs 114 times, despite its conspicuous absence from Sura 9 (it occurs twice in Sura 27) & 114= 19x6.\n 5. From the missing Basmalah of Sura 9 to the extra Basmalah of Sura 27, there are precisely 19 suras.\n 6. It follows that the total of the sura numbers from 9 to 27 (9+10+11+12+...+26+27) is 342, or .............19 x 18.\n 7. This total (342) also equals the number of words between the two Basmalahs of Sura 27, and 342 = 19 x 18.\n 8. The famous first revelation (sura 96:1-5) consists of 19 words.\n 9. This 19-worded first revelation consists of 76 letters = 19 x 4.\n 10. Sura 96, first in the chronological sequence, consists of 19 verses.\n 11. This first chronological sura is placed atop the last ..19 suras.\n 12. Sura 96 consists of 304 Arabic letters, and 304 equals .19 x 16.\n 13. The last revelation (Sura 110) consists of ............19 words.\n 14. The first verse of the last revelation (110:1) consists of19 letters.\n 15. 14 different Arabic letters, form 14 different sets of \"Quranic Initials\" (such as A.L.M. of 2:1), and prefix 29 suras. These numbers add up to 14+14+29 = 57 = ......19 x 3.\n 16. The total of the 29 sura numbers where the Quranic Initials occur is 2+3+7+...+50+68 = 822, and 822+14 (14 sets of initials) equals 836, or ................. 19 x 44.\n 17. Between the first initialed sura (Sura 2) and the last initialed sura (Sura 68) there are 38 un-initialed suras 19 x 2.\n 18. Between the first and last initialed sura there are ....19 sets of alternating \"initialed\" and \"un-initialed\" suras.\n 19. The Quran mentions 30 different numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 19, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 99, 100, 200, 300, 1000, 2000, 3000, 5000, 50,000, & 100,000. The sum of these numbers is 162146, which equals 19x8534.\n \n And if you think this is amazing please, PLEASE for your own good, visit the website below where I got all this information from IT WILL BLOW YOUR MIND! God be with you.\n \n http://www.submission.org/math-ap1.html\n\n \n Ahhhh!! That is the dumbest thing I have ever heard, well second dumbest considering you're also the one who said that this would \"Change your life\"\n \n dude it's a pattern. If you look hard enough long enough you're gonna eventually find some sort of pattern.look for the number 17 0r 23 or something, i bet you'll find a thousand things in any book that somehow relate to the number you chose. The only thing that you have proven is that someone has waaaay too much time on their hands.",

   "While reading the first post, I noticed that several of the numbers mentioned were 19 * some random big number. I'd like to point out that this whole \"19 factor\" is only valid if the big random number it is multiplied by is prime. Otherwise, all that akharian is arguing is that \"Woo, look, all these numbers are divisible by 19! Shhh, ignore the other numbers they are dividible by!\"\n \n To illustrate my point, take, for example, 19 * 8534, which is mentioned, is also equal to 38 * 4267.",
