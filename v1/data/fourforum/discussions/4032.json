   "A good reason to hate Yushchenko\n I don't think Yushchenko will be a good president. All he promised us before the election is a pure fiction. For example, he promised us he would lead Ukrainian troops out of Iraq. What in real? Nothing of the kind!!! Our soldiers will stay in Iraq and even more Ukrainians will be headed there. Do you know why I think so? Because the Americans voiced no protest when Yushchenko said our troops would return home. They knew Yushchenko was lying. By the way, do you know why Polish politicians and Alexander Kwasnevski bodily were so concerned of expeditious settlement of Ukrainian crisis that even took personal part in it along with Orange Revolution? It was planned that Ukrainian soldiers in Iraq would take upon themselves part of functions run by Polish contingent, which would allow Poland to lead its military personnel out of Iraq. Well done, Mr Yushchenko! Bravo! I wish you had died of that poisoning so that Yanukovich brought our troops home.",

   "Poland was removing their troops anyway. \n They only had about 2000 there anyway.\n \n Poland is an ally of the US and UK.\n I thought that Yushchenko is pro-US, pro-EU, and a friend to Poland.\n Why would he promise to reduce Ukranian troop levels?\n That doesn't make sense.\n You shouldn't have believed him if he said that.\n \n I don't know what to make of this page:\n http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/iraq_orbat.htm (block popups)\n \nA Dec. 3 ITAR-TASS report noted that there were 1,589 Ukrainian troops with 2,072 pieces of equipment deployed to Iraq. It also noted that a majority of the Ukrainian Parliament had offered their support for a proposal calling on the country's president to withdraw its troops from Iraq.\n\n \n \nThe Ukrainian national security and defense council decided on Oct. 19, to gradually reduce the size of its contingent in Iraq. The reduction is reported to begin with the rotation of troops begun on Sep. 22 and will reduce the number of troops there by 200. The rotation was completed on Oct. 15, with 1,200 troops having returned home.\n\n \n This makes it sound like the troops will be leaving soon, but there will be a few rotations before everyone is home, so technically \"more\" troops will go to Iraq, but a lot will come back. Eventually, they will all be home.",
