Just get rid of them.\n \n Megan believes in grass roots approaches. Students can influence other students. If you see someone harrassing some else, suck it up, go over and tell them to knock it off. Be a leader!\n \n Carolyn . . . people with personal power, (that's right, you popular folks) should stand up and do the right thing. Use your personal power to make school a better place for everyone . . . popular or unpopular. Don't let the bullies win! \n \n emoticon_xdonno",

However they do find it perfectly reasonable to suspend someone over: a drink, shirt, hair color, drawing or something else completely useless that doesn't hurt anyone.\n \n Reason behind all the current school failures in authority: Too many liberal teachers.",
