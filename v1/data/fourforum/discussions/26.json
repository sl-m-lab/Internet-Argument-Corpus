   "Schools should not adapt uniforms.\n \n Most importantly, the majority of students would prefer to chose what they wear.\n \n Furthermore, unconfortable (most fancy clothes are in more childrens' opinions) uniforms would be much more of a distraction from learning than other peoples choices in clothing.\n \n Some feel that uniforms would take away from students creativity. Even if this is false, it does not mean there is any reason for uniforms.\n \n Uniforms would not decrese people making fun of each other. People will do it for other reasons anyway.\n \n Uniforms will encourage, not discourage rebelion.\n \n If uniforms are adapted, parents will have move clothes to buy for their children since they will still want clothes for after school and on weekends along with their uniform.\n \n The \"it gets them ready for real life\" is silly. Children don't need to wear uniforms for 13 years to learn how to wear uniforms.\n \n The idea that children make their own dress code may be true, but irrelevant, since that doesn't logicly lead to wearing uniforms. And children prefer the uniforms they get to chose.\n \n It only brings a school together in the sense that they look similar. It doesn't make anyone care more.\n \n Also, uniforms wouldn't decrese how much students get in trouble for what they wear, it would be more frequent for someone to break the rules if there was more to break.",

They are a symbol of unity and professionalism in the work place and can be used as such in schools as well. They can help create order, conformaty, and level the playing field for everyone especially in the area of rich vs poor. Is it going to make people smarter? Maybe. I think the way a person dresses will affect the way they act. A person dressed in a suit is more likely to act in a professional and intellegent way than a person dressed in casual wear. The result of this could be that the person will act more professional and conform to the learning atmosphere provided and in the long run that could help make them more informed. Although I see a lot of cons to wearing uniforms and I didn't go to a school where uniforms were required, I think these pro's are pretty convincing.",

   "[And what is the purpose of wearing uniforms at work? It is so that everyone will be considered the same. So that the service that you get from one person should be the same service that you would have received from anywhere else.]\n \n Exactly; the same thing goes for the students at school. While workers wear uniforms to offer the same service to all customers, students should wear uniforms to give and recieve the same service/treatment from one another, as well as the administration. This would set students on an equal footing and put more of the focus on learning.\n \n [How is it valid? If there is no dress code (and thus, no violations), and you implement one, how will the number of violations go down?]\n \n \n I am referring to the dress codes that are already in place in most schools. The fact is that these codes are just downright ineffective. There is not enough time in the day for each teacher to crack down on the large number of students who break these dress codes each and every day. Uniforms would eliminate so many violations because it is quite easy to see when a student has voilated the uniform policy. At a school where uniforms are enforced, the students are limited to how many ways they can violate the dress code. By wearing uniforms, students are set on their entire school wardrobe. The same shoes, bottoms, and tops are required; that's that. \n \n [But if you implement a uniform policy, parents will have to purchase that clothing for their children anyway. Then, on top of it, they will have to purchase clothing to meet the uniform policy.]\n \n Lets do the math. Students spend 180 days in school (about 1/2 the year). Schools with uniforms recommend that each student have 2 sets of uniforms. If students were to wear the same two outfits to public school every day they would be laughed out of class. The students at public school probably have about 16 different outfits(Without mixing and matching). To incorporate uniforms would be to decrease parent's spending for school uniforms by more than half that of a regular school year without uniforms. Even with the extra cost of clothing outside of school the total cost for parents would be much less.The greater amount originally set to spend for students would be replaced by a much smaller figure to purchase the uniforms for school.",

School is 8 hours of a 16 hour (not counting 8 hrs of sleeping) day, not to mention the weekends. We should be thankful we can choose what to wear at all. That's right. Our rights include clothing too. Many places are not this fortunate.\n If one can't accept wearing school uniforms, they could find another social institution that focuses completely on appearances and not on learning anything. Or they could just drop out and have a limited selection of jobs available. Wearing uniforms would be a small price to pay to eliminate distractions and hard feelings involving social status. (i.e.. Someone has on a $300 outfit. Most would imply that they're better than others) \n I also agree with the fact that the dress codes don't cut it anymore. One of the reasons for that is because there are barely any clothes made to fit the dress code anymore. I have to hunt for them.\n I have seen girls come to school (now excuse my language) with shirts, where if they were cut one centimeter lower, their nipples would show, and in shorts where if they were cut any higher, their privates would be hanging out.(yes, I mean girls, too). I think there's something WAAAAAY wrong with that. For some reasont the guys don't have problems; they strike me as more decent at times... Anyway, Uniforms would eliminate that. However, I think the uniforms should be within reason. I'd be against required skirts for the girls; this isn't the 18th century. Ties would be... maybe in the extremes too. We so easily accept uniforms for athletics, why are we so reluctant to accept them for classroom? \n People are going to have to try with something other than clothes to get me to like them. Personality maybe?",

Year after year, the limits on what are being worn are being stretched, and it is becoming rediculous. Students can express their individuality through other means than their clothing. Unifroms promote professionalism within school, and also represent that students are there for a common purpose, to learn.\n\n \n I agree completely. There are girls in my school who dress ridiculously. They yell at kids for having a shirt strap being less than two inches, yet they don't care that when some girls bend over you can see directly up their skirt, sometimes without them bending over.

In Britain there are uniforms in both public and state schools, that does not stop people looking like hookers. V. short skirt, ill fitting shirt, tie made to be no more than an inch in length and caked in make up. More girls looked like hookers at my school than anything else.\n \n However that said I am totally in favour of school uniforms for two reasons. Firstly it massively cuts down on bullying. It really does. Sure kids are going to be bullied in other ways, but those other ways don't force them to shell out ridiculous amounts of money on designer clothes to avoid. In fact in that sense it even reduces conformity in a way. By forcing everyone to conform to the same group it lessens class/fashion conformity which can be a lot more damaging.\n \n But the most important point for school uniform: school disco! Ahh where would my Friday nights at university have been if once a week we didn't all dig out white shirts, striped ties and prefect badges and spent the night getting completely wasted, listening to bad nostalgic music and getting off with tarted up girls with pigtails and fake freckles?\n \n Ahh those were the days, y'all don't know what you're missing...",

   "Reading the thread, there are some rather great opinions stated for the non-uniform schools. The one that struck me the most pointed out how uniforms are worn while working in a fast-food atmosphere while teachers are not made to wear uniforms.\n \n However, as compelling as that is, I am a mother of three girls and I am all for uniforms in the schools. This isn't the case at this time but I would be thrilled if it was.\n \n Of course every person, no matter the age, desires individuality. When my girls are grown and on their own they may be as individual as they so choose. At this point and time in their lives they are not permitted to dress a certain way, etc.\n \n Uniforms would certainly save money and time, that is a given. Yes, it would take away from the child but at the same time uniforms are going to also take away the problems of who is wearing what, who can afford to wear what, who is allowed to wear what etc. The main purpose of school should be to learn. We all know that isn't the case all the time, you must have a social end of the school scale. That social end can remain while all of the students are in uniforms.\n \n Dress codes do not work if they are not enforced. I see so many children heading to school looking as if they should be headed to the nearest street corner. It all comes down to the parents. If the parents don't care what their child looks like or wears when they leave the house at least uniforms will prevent some children from looking like nothing more than a whore.",

   "Would School Uniforms improve our schools ?\n \n http://www.youdebate.com/DEBATES/school_uniforms.HTM\n\n Imagine a classroom filled with young children, sitting at desks and listening to the teacher lecture. They are all dressed in different colors and different types of clothes. Now imagine that classroom with the same group of children all dressed the same. Many schools across the country have converted to school uniforms. They require the girls wear skirts or pants and the boys dress pants and shirts with a tie. This is a terrible idea in many aspects. First graders are being expected to dress like adults and there is no individuality in the schools.\n In school, elementary students have recess and sometimes gym. If schools expect children to wear uniforms, they will not be able to play like normal children. The girls will have to walk around and be ladylike and the boy will have to be perfect gentleman. They will not be able to be kids. When the children grow and enter high school, they are losing some of their youth by wearing school uniforms. Many teenagers like to go out and buy clothes and with school uniforms they would not have as fun doing this. They would all have to dress the same everyday and only have a chance to wear regular clothes on weekend or in the evenings.\n School uniforms are also not a great idea because no one is able to be unique and show individualism. Clothes show personality and when people wear clothes they feel comfortable in, they are able to be themselves. Many people make first impressions of another person according to the types of clothes that person wears. If schools required uniforms, these first impressions would not be made right away. This country also pushes for people to be themselves and be individuals. If student are required to wear school uniform would they be an individual? The answer is no. They would end up being carbon copies of everyone else in their class. This is wrong and does not reflect the free country that America has worked so hard to become \n School uniforms should not be required. Students should have the right to wear whatever they choose within reason. If the United States wants to have freedom of expression, students should not be required to wear a uniform. Schools should be filled with all kinds of color and the only way to do this is not to require school uniforms.\n \n Beth Eyster",

   "School uniforms can be implemented very well in the public schoold systems. I have children who loved the program and it did not negatively affect their \"creativity\" or \"expression\" in any way. There are ample opportunities in art, music and other curriculum items to express one's crweativity and individuality. Saying that uniforms somehow stifle that is pretty one-diemnsional thinking. Do we really want our children thinking that what we wear is taht important as a means of personal expression? Just a thought.\n \n Also, I do not think that the styles being promoted today that emphasize tight pants, short shorts and tight tops very individualistic or a means of expression, after all, every kid wears them, so how in the world does wearing anything you want to school mean that your child is advancing their sense of personal expression. Very thin argument.\n \n They are a tremendous equalizer in the younger grades and there is absolutely no date to suggest a negative result. On the contraray, the results for the children as well as the school have been very positive in the public shool systems where they have been implemented. Cost may be a ligitimate issue for some parents which is a good point and not to be missed, but it is not reason enough to sway the argument in my opinion.

   "Wow ! I am quite impressed by the debating going on here about the mandated use of uniforms in school. It is showing me , a old geezer here, that the young people do have the ability to form opinions about what it is important to them. Guess what ? I am a 52 year old male, I had strong opinions in school, and now I get to wear a uniform EVERDAY to make my living !! Isnt that just , like, I mean, ya know, so like , UNCool ????? \n \n Being serious now, young people need to focus on ONE thing and ONE thing only, while they are serving that term of imprisonment that us old geezers are forcing them to endure . AND that is : GETTING THE BEST EDUCATION POSSIBLE WHILE THEY CAN ...\n \n I came through school when guys expressed their \" individualism\" , by rolling up their t-shirts sleeves and putting their smokes in them. I will give you a quick scenario of the dress codes in the fifty/ sixties era back when I went to school. Guys like myself wore what ever their parents could afford to provide for them . The guys like me wore bluejeans and flannel or short sleeve cotton shirts , that sported a lot of our Mom's sewing patches. The kids from the higher income families got to wear permanent press slacks and knit shirts, the girls wore nice dresses or below the knee skirts. The one common thread to all of this was , one could immediately tell by the way the kid dressed , the income and status of that child's family. The teachers at that time knew it, the classmates knew it, and we were treated with bias for the way we dressed....\n \n The Catholic school located 15 miles up the country road , had the uniform dress code. Males wore nice clean white shirts and pressed blue slacks, the girls wore white blouses and blue \" below the knee\" skirts. I was always envious of those \"all dressed alike \" kids because they all looked so disciplined and well groomed , they did not have to worry about being ashamed of what they wore , something we were at times... \n \n So, youngsters, having uniforms is not at all a bad thing. For one , it will ease the financial burden of your parents having to \" keep up\" with all of the peer pressure put out by your richer friends wearing their designer clothes.\n Two, you wont be \"looked down \" on by your friends and peers for not being \"cool\" like they think they are . They will , my goodness ! look just like you do in their uniform. And three , the most important thing for you young people IS ...,\n \n You are only having to do this education \"thingy \" for 12 years of your youngest years, and you lucky ones will have the scholastic ability and financial means to go on to college, hopefully. After you graduate and are on your own making whatever ever living you can, you may see some of those \" ole SO COOL dressed friends\" of yours , that slobbed though school , are now wearing uniforms daily at a quick lube shop....\n \n You only have 12 to 14 years to set yourself up to get a education, that will determine where you will be at in your adult life. Statistics show now the average life span may be 70 to 85 years . You are spending the most precious 12 to 16 years of your life to get set up for the next 60 years of it !!!! So think about it, you have 60 YEARS to enjoy the rewards of getting the best education you can ! ...\n \n What is more important to your career future, impressing your little snit friends , (that you have a HIGH percentage chance of never seeing again after graduating), with that designer thong sticking out above your hip hugger jeans with your butt crack showing, or your designer pants that you have to scratch around on the floor to find the zipper in it to take a whiz, OR impress them later in life when it matters, as they drive up in a 90 taurus and park in front of your plush office with your mercedes sitting there ? ...\n \n \n O.K. getting a little too imaginative here, but I am very passionate about young people getting the best education possible , by whatever means they can. If a uniform code is needed to get some type of discipline and regime back in school today, I am all for it. The days of graduating high school and going to work at the local manufacturing plant is over. The immigrants are rapidly taking the manual labor - semi skilled and even crafsman /tradesmen jobs over. So, coming out of high school now with a low grade diploma, is just not going to cut it today, as in did back in the sixties...\n \n As these young people sit in front of a Human Resources Director's desk and get interviewed for that dream job , one they studied so hard to get a education for , trust me, the interviewers qualification checklist WILL NOT have a box to check , about just how COOL they were dressed in school. :) all jmo",

After that an on weekends they can do whatever they like, with whomever they like. It's not going ot kill your social life or your fashion life, but it will prevent people from being picked on in school beause of silly things like clothes.

   "School uniforms do help in school. I'm 14 and just graduated 8th grade at a school that has uniforms. I like the uniforms because they make you focus on learning and not the clothes on the people around you. I like wearing my uniform and so do many of my classmates. You get to sleep in later (not worrying about clothes), and you look smarter. Sometimes, my friends and I go to each other's houses and do stuff and we'll realize that its like 8 PM and we still have our uniforms on doing stuff. Some people wear it on weekends and after school (also the girls look FINE in skirts and button shitrts!!!). I even knew one kid who slept in his! \n \n I also say uniforms are a great thing for public schools too. I always hear about school stabbings and shootings and suicides due from bullying. This could be reduced and almost prevented if uniforms were in public schools. \n \n Also, many parents can't afford to send their child to a private school, so they must go to a public school. Uniforms cost less than a t-shirt or a pair of jeans (and make you look smarter and more organized) \n \n I think uniforms are a great thing.[/QUOTE]",

   "I think that dress codes are perfectly fine, school uniforms lower a child's imagination and decision making ability. My mom used to pick out my clothes for school in elementary. This was like a school uniform because I had no say in what I did or did not want to wear. Since I never had the opportunity to pick out my clothes, in middle school i had to pick them out the night before because it would take me about 30 minutes to decide what I wanted to wear! Needless to say, after a while, I got the hang of it and decided on what to wear faster and faster. Eventually near high school, I was able to decide in a few seconds, and would just choose in the morning.\n \n As for how much clothes cost, it depends on where you go. If you go to a vintage store like Abercrombie and Finch, Rich's, Macy's, etc. you pay $80 for a regular t-shirt you could buy in Walmart for $20 (U.S.)! If you go to some sports clothing store and pay for $80-120 (U.S.) shoes, then you're ripping yourself off, because you can pay for the same shoes at a discount store for $15-30 (U.S.)! School uniforms aren't much better; I've seen t-shirts and shoes worth $40-80. Point is, why pay for something so expensive when you don't have to? It's because people want to flaunt their money, or make people assume that you have money. After all, you could have a lot of expensive things and be $10,000's in debt. Does that say you have money? No, it shows you have a spending problem and need help.\n \n Obviously, given in earlier discussions, school uniforms have nothing to do with the successfullness in the students, and if so, very little. There are people that said that it worked, and some that said it didn't. Personally, I don't think school uniforms cut down on the gangs, drugs, violence, etc. There are other places to hide drugs and weapons other than in the clothes of the student, like their bookbags, purses, or bodily orphases. I'm sure if students wanted, they would find some way to sneak it in. However, I will say that the only place to solve this problem is to have the parents aware of what their child is doing, and the parents need to take immediate action! Parents need to stop trying to be their childrens' friend and start acting as their parents, punish bad children, praise good children! Now I'm getting off topic here, so I am assuming I've had my say.",

   "I just don't understand how not having uniforms is somehow going to hurt people. \n \n So what if you don't have the \"cool\" brand of shoes or jeans? When I was in high school I made a point of buying clothing at Salvation Army stores. I wore whatever I wanted to wear, whatever I was comfortable in, and to be honest never once was concerned with what anyone thought or said about what I wore. In retrospect, I smack myself on the forehead thinking about some of the ridiculous stuff I wore to school (the day I wore lemon yellow bellbottoms and a polyester white shirt with brown polka dots, both straight out of the 1970s, comes to mind), but I turned out okay and still had plenty of friends. The fact of the matter is that no one but the most shallow and idiotic at the school ever really gave me XXXX for what I wore. The ones who were pathetic enough to try to make an issue about it weren't the kind of people I wanted to be friends with, anyway, and as a result I never let it bother me.\n \n Perhaps there's less confidence in high schoolers today than 8 years ago when I was in the middle of high school, but I really doubt it. If you want to wear gray slacks and a white button-down to school every day, that's your prerogative. If you want to wear yellow bellbottoms and a polyester shirt that belongs on the set of Saturday Night Fever, that, too, is your prerogative. What's the problem?",

   "Schools must never adapt uniforms, or any kind of dress code for that matter.\n When I was in high school, dressing up was something done on a special occasion. (Athletes for the day leading up to the game, assemblies for homecoming queen, prom king/queen, and the like, and drama department was about to put on a show, ect.) Our dress code was prodomenately geared towards the girls, (which is usually the case when a dress code is based upon what not to wear.) Girls had to have skirts going longer then finger lenghth. They could not show cleavege. (Us guys weren't really affected by it. (Or were we? ;) )) This wasn't as big of a deal to the upper classman as it was to the freshman.\n Long story short, uniforms and dress codes are just going to cause more problems all around. Now, Wez typed something about \u00a3120. I don't know how much that is in American money but a lot of families where I'm from would not really be able to afford any kind of uniforms.

   "personally, i'm for school uniforms for several reasons. teen guys could get distracted by girls who wear these little short mini skirts showing off their stuff and these really low cut shirts that show major clevage. teen girls can get distracted by guys who wear these really big muscle shirts or these really baggy pants that sag down to their knees showing off their boxers/underwear. what's the point in wearing this nonsense to school? students are there to learn. also, baggy clothes can easily hide drugs and weapons, i've seen it personally happen at my junior and high school many times. also, with uniforms, it would be more difficult to tell who was who in the economic status. kids often get made fun of for wearing certain clothes from WalMart or KMart or some \"cheap\" store like that. also, it's harder for cliques to form in school, you couldn't tell as easily who was which stereostype. sure, they're hair could be the same, or whatever, but that would be the only obvious thing. no, uniforms aren't stylish, no, not many kids want them, but sometimes they're for the best. if you're against school uniforms, why don't you survey your/your child's school on violence, drugs, bullying/teasing, and dress code violations. when you realize the severity of certain things, your mind changes.\n \n -submitted by deadly_poetic",

   "I have just read through most of this thread, and without stating my OWN beliefs on the subject, I will first say that it's interesting because those of you FOR school uniforms and those of you AGAINST them are frequently making the same points. For example...I keep seeing the statement, \"Clothes don't define me.\" That's great, so then wearing a uniform wouldn't make a difference? And that statement has been repeated by many whom are ANTI-uniform. Very contrary, in my opinion.\n That being said, I think that school uniforms are great, but not in all schools. I teach in a school that has students wearing uniforms, and almost all of them enjoy wearing the uniform, however, it's the right decision for how our school is run. Depending on a uniforms use and intentions, it may be a good thing and a bad thing. \n For administrators to think that a uniform will solve social issues in a school is wishful thinking. It's good administration, good teachers and a good discipline plan that makes social issues end. However, for a school like mine that uses them more for the positive effect of creating a community feel where the kids can identify more strongly with their school, I think they are a good thing.\n So I guess that puts me on the fence, but that is how I feel about uniforms. I do not think anyone is right or wrong for their opinions because, again, uniforms will work in different ways depending upon the school they are implemented in.",

The strangest, but most revealing moments occurred when I would look at their driver's license, and some of my closest friends would have never received more than a polite hello and the time of day from me, if we would have met when they looked like their driver's license photo.

   "I think uniforms would have the parents of school waste all there money on clothes that their kids dont even like. and if a family doesnt have that much money they'll have to pay like $200 worth of clothes that their kids are forced to wear. I think its against the human rights during school.\n\n \n I must say, I do agree with this statement. I, myself, am not in exactly the greatest financial situation. If school uniforms are inforced, students will be forced to purchase said uniforms. These usually range anywhere from $20 to $40, depending on how picky the school wants to be. If the uniforms do cost $40, most parents will want to purchase their children five sets of uniforms. Your already up to $200 dollars. Now, figure that you have three children. You now have to purchase your children a total of fifteen uniforms. Your total is now $600. No child is going to want to wear their uniforms outside of school, which means having to purchase normal clothes. Figure seven pairs of jeans, and seven shirts. The jeans cost $15, and the shirts cost $10. You are now at $175 per child, and $525 for the three. Add on your total for school uniforms, and you have a total of $1125. Children are constantly growing, and will probably outgrow their uniforms every, or every other year. which means at least $1125 every two years.\n \n Ok, so you say \"i'll just only buy two sets of uniforms each for my 3 children, and wash them every other day.\" This means that you will now be increasing your electric bill, your water bill, and possibly your gas bill. Either way, the school uniforms are going to cost families a lot of money. Especially those who have lower-middle class incomes. That $1125 every other year, could go towards better things, such as keeping a roof over your head, or supplying your family with food.",

   "At my school we have a really strict dress code, which is kinda like uniforms but whatever. The school says that dress code is really good for the school and they have all these reasons..\n \n There first reason is that it will lower the amount of fights. Problems is there have been more fights. Fights in high school have nothing to do with clothes, anyway.\n \n Their second reason is that instills a sense of school unity. Nope everyone still hates each other as much as they used to.. if not more.\n \n Their third reason is that it's cheaper.. Since when?! First of all, Uniform type clothing costs more than regular clothes and then you have to buy regular clothes anyway.. So it's more than double the price.\n \n Their forth reason was that its easy to spot intruders.. sorry that would have worked but they post the dress code rules on the internet.\n \n Their fifth reason was that it got rid of gang symbols.. but it doesn't matter! Just cause can't have your gang symbols doesn't mean your not gonna be in the gang anymore..\n \n Their sixth reason was that it would stop kids from getting picked on for not having name brand clothes. Well, if we had real uniforms that would be true, however we don't. I can go out and buy Dickies brand khaki pants or i could go to the thrift store... you can still get name brand collared shirts and khaki pants..

   "Uniforms, according to me, prevent the student from distractions. It means equality to all students because they are not being judged by the clothes that they wear. Thats why it's called UNI-FORM (Of one form or one type- meaning that all are the same/equal).They do not spend or \"waste\" time in the morning by digging through their wardrobe looking for the trendiest clothes that they have. When students wear uniform, they are representing their school and people will notice them by their clothes and will immediately know that they are from that school.\n Most parents do not agree with what their children wear or want to wear to school (in non-uniform schools) as sometimes the clothes they wear have signs or writing encouraging drugs and alcohol.\n When there are schools without uniform, sometimes, some students are bullied or made fun of because of the clothes that they are wearing. A big percentage of a person's \"coolness'' is rated by the clothes they wear, though it should be rated more on their personality, their background, and how much you can trust them.\n There are some bad things about uniform for exampl the cost and sometimes they aren't very comfortable or attractive...\n \n Apparently, they say that baggier clothes are easier for carrying drugs, though this is not always the case.\n\n \n \n Ah!

When boys have to wear school uniforms with short shorts and knee-length socks and girls skirts and knee-length socks the year round - this would improve our schools. To stand the concomitant discomfort of cold winter weather with bare legs, is very useful to built up the character of a child, to pass something through and not to surch for the first best solution. It is also healthy, good for toughening, looks energetic and shows the school kids their standing in society. It is also cheaper to have a boy in shorts and a girl in skirts than in trousers.",

   "I am definitely against uniforms. OF COURSE clothing isn't the ONLY way for one to express one's individuality, but it plays a big part. In my school, we had a dress code, which had its flaws. But if you think that people won't follow the dress code but they will wear uniforms... emoticon_xdonno . And the truth is, at least where I'm from (Brooklyn), people don't judge you on how expensive your clothes are AT ALL. While they might judge you on clothing, it's more of a style thing, and less of a money thing. And \"cool\" clothes often don't cost a lot of money. And by not a lot, I mean not a lot.\n \n While I admit that the some of the points that people have made are relevant (the professionalism, less bullying, etc.), I guess my point is that kids are kids and they want to have fun. THey don't want to look like adults, and there's no GREAT reason to make them.\n \n As a side note, it's definitely worth noting that uniforms can make someone who didn't look poor before the uniforms were implemented, look poor. For instance, at my friend's school, they have to wear a polo shirt everyday. And you know what? The rich kids wear Ralph Lauren and Lacoste (which can be $70 a shirt), and the not so rich wear the generic brand.",

   "I am a father of 2 girls in a school district that is currently taking steps to implement a district wide (K-12) uniform policy. I decided to search the net to better educate myself on the pros and cons and get a sense of what results such a policy might have for my kids. Suffice it to say that I am not in favor of this new policy and the more I dig into the subject the less inclined I am to sit back and allow such a blind ambition to swallow my kids future school years.... and beyond.\n \n I have gone to a number of meetings and listened to many local views on why a school uniform policy should or shouldn't be enforced here in my daughters' schools. I have read feedback from parents on countless forums, recalled the speech by then president Clinton on school reform, had open heart to heart talks with both of my kids and read from cover to cover, the only scientific study published on the subject that I could find. I've done my homework so to say!! I have drawn (in large part to these scientific, non-bias studies) that uniform policies do very little if anything at all to actually meet the originally intended effects. \n \n Instead it appears that they are being used as a \"band-aid\" for a number of other underlying problems. You cannot remove hatred from a 15 year old boy by changing his clothing!! You cannot curtail bullying by removing designer sneakers from the school. These are behavioral issues that result either from poor parenting, mental instability or lack of discipline within the school. All of which should be dealt with directly, not ignored by enforcing conformity instead. It is a dis-service to the individual student that needs, in fact is crying out for, extra assistance.\n By implementing a uniform policy we simply shift the blame of poor parenting and failed faculty leadership to the students attire. By making our students conform to the masses we are really relieving ourselves of the burden of good early parenting!! Such a shame really, because without demonstrating good parenting to our kids at the home front, they surely will not be capable of passing those values to their own kids in the future. \n \n My daughter is a bright girl (trying not to toot my horn here but my kids are the only example I can draw from) whom has been in the schools \"gifted and talented\" program since 1st grade. She moved onto intermediate school (3-5) where she made honor role every semester, played in the band, attended dance classes after school along with the schools \"Just say No\" program. My wife and I have adopted a parenting approach that allows her to make choices, express herself and question things that she feels are wrong or inappropriate. In doing this we have found her to be a very logical and calculated thinker that knows her limits and the difference between right and wrong. Now, don't get me wrong!! It's a process that started long before this year. She is more \"guided\" than free to make random, unchecked final decisions. But more and more as time goes on.... she needs less and less input from us while coming to the same desired outcome. My point?...\n A uniform dress policy would not be needed if more \"parenting\" were being done for the kids that have caused our school district to believe this policy is needed!! Uniform Policies would not be such an issue and schools would not feel the need to relieve parents of their duties if parents would step up and take a more active role in their kids lives.\n \n My daughters \"free thinking\" spirit and sense of \"self\" will be stunted should we as adults impose a restriction on her individuality by telling her she can no longer think for herself when she has already demonstrated that she is more than capably for doing so responsibly.\n \n I encourage everyone to read the only non-bias data available on the subject, scientific studies, before drawing any conclusions. Most information readily available is nothing more than feedback from the same people (administrators, principles, and board members) that pushed so hard to get the policies approved to begin with. That's like allowing your schools accounting dept. to audit itself. An independent study was done by David L. Brunsma and Kerry A. Rockquemore from the Dept. of Sociology at the University of Notre Dame of the results these programs. The study focused on \"The Effects of Student Uniforms on Attendance, Behavior Problems, Substance Use and Academic Achievement\". I think you'll be surprised by the findings not only in uniform policies in the public sector but also in Catholic schools.\n The basis for their study was derived from the observation that Long Beach Unified School District Data (data that was collected by the school district itself after promoting the idea) was being used by the federal administration to promote the unsubstantiated claim of positive results. Unfortunately it is the LBUSD information that most schools use to promote their goals of uniforms rather than the independant studies.\n \n Daddy Man",

   "ok, honestly i think that school uniforms are a good thing. people who talk about how it diminishes creativity and has no positive benifits need to stop to think about what they are saying. Being creative only in school is something that is your problem alone, you can be creative with the rest of your day, like ohhh say... when your hanging out with your friends afterwords? \n As for things like losing individuality; ok lets break that one down, when you get out into the world (as in not in america) alot of other culture promote collectivism and other things like working with others, co-operating and the such. From the early ages most americans are taught to try and be independent and this thought process usually sprout some superiority complex where they think they are better than others (and yes this doesnt happen to everyone, but no-a-days most americans are being raised in a very bad environment who could use a little less \"individuality\" and learn how to respect there fellow classmate/people) but basically my point there is that we are taught to think for ourselves and try hard while seeking others help on very minimal levels, then when we get towards college level educations we are then restructured into a more collectivistic view point where u need to work with others. there is no job that a person can have where he will be entirely alone (he will have acess to others, could be working with others at some point) and i think learning this co-operation at an earlier age would be more benifical. \n to stop from making this opinion any more lengthy ill just say, school uniforms arent the great evil everyones making them out too be, i do agree that possibly they should be introduced around middle school level and definetly have an opt out option but other than that and a few other exceptions they are definetly a positive thing.",

   "Hi,\n I'm 16 and go to a public school in north England.\n At my school we have to wear uniform, this being a black skirt/trousers, white shirt, tie, black jumper, black shoes and a blazer. We wear this from year 7-11.\n I'm now speaking from a student's perspective, I see that school uniform can be annoying and pointless at times but on the whole there is a point. \n When I get up in the morning I find comfort with knowing what im going to put on and many people may not admit it, but its nice not having to spend half an hour deciding what top to wear today! \n Also school uniforms are cost effective to parents, if a there child had to go to school in normal clothes then the student may feel under pressure to dress in the coolest clothes, and the parent may not be finally supported to provide such a high cost expectation. Therefore is the child came to school wearing something not accepted by there friends this may in turn lead to bulling, which is the last thing that any person or school needs.\n School uniform also provides a start to ideas of life, I know im only 16 but I can already see that during your life, mainly at work you have to act and more importantly dress a certain way, and uniforms are the start of setting this idea in. \n Now to my point, I find that I want to express myself and show my personality in my clothing and sometimes my uniform stops me from doing so. If school enforced a uniform they should also say that a small amount of personality may be added such as a belt or necklace. Now some may say that a student personalizing their uniform is against the point, I say that we live in such a cultured world when young people finally have a say and a opinion, so why not let them show there personalities in their clothing!\n I hope that you agree with me and maybe just maybe what ive said may influence you to change things,\n Lily",

We snuck into the upper floor and hid in the bathrooms. We did all kinds of stuff and rarely got caught. Then, when I moved to a public middle school with no uniforms, I was practically an angel.

   "Since you underlined the word scientific, you must be right emoticon_rolleyes \n\n \n I underlined scientific because so many people refer back to \"studies\" and \"surveys\" as viable information. Many of these studies are conducted by the very governing bodies that fought for a year or two to get the uniforms implemented in the first place and or don't go nearly deep enough to consider all the variable that many have a bearing in their results. I think scientific studies, conducted independently, may be the only non-bias source of info. \n \n \nIf the proficiency of the school in teaching its students has no bearing on a uniform, why would you oppose it? According to you, it doesn't make any difference, so there is no reason to be against it.\n\n \n I oppose uniforms in most cases because of the reasoning in which they are being implemented (usually to fix an underlying problem not associated with dress). Many uniform policies are put in place as a quick fix to serious issues (gang violence, academic short falls, poor student attendance and/or attitude, improper dress code enforcement policies) that go unchecked because the school board and parents believe that the uniforms will be the saving grace to these issues. I don't think that dress changes the academic environment, the safety factor, the bullying and so forth....\n \n \nSupposedly, school prepares you for the real world. This is why I used the Taco Bell example. There aren't too many jobs that don't have a uniform or some kind of dress code. Therefore, in the interest of preparing kids for the real world, I think school uniforms make complete sense. The fact that Taco Bell pays its employees is irrelevant and a complete dodge to the point being made.\n\n \n ...I also don't believe a uniform is common-place in the working world....Dress Code yes...Uniforms no!! Lets not confuse the two or try to combine them. One tells you what you MUST wear and the other gives you a guideline for what you must not. \n Lawyers, Business men & women, Accountants and most other professional positions expect you to have learned about making good choices and present yourself in proper attire based on guidelines (sounds like a dress code). Teaching our kids to make these \"good\" choices is the responsibility of parents. But helping to enforce that also falls on the schools. Taking that early learning lesson away from kids only mutes the process IMO. Therefore, in the interest in preparing our kids for the real world...I think uniforms make a poor choice.\n \n If uniforms were such a win, win for the working world prep...why don't colleges require them. Why doesn't business law school have a uniform or engineers or Computer MCSE courses? Dress Codes that teach proper etiquette (and is enforced) yes....a uniform? No\n \n It's the crappy jobs that require a uniform because the pay scale is so low they attract the employees with lower self-esteam and/or use they want to use the advertising space on their employees' backs to promote their products...hehe\n \n The fact that Taco Bell pays the individual to wear a uniform is what is not relevant. My point is you cannot compare a paid individuals reasoning for wearing a uniform with that of a person who has no choice in the matter. Especially when they are being worn for two distinctly different reasons.\n The truth is that the public schools are using them for other reasons...discipline, lack of good policies, misconception that it will improve academics.",

Really, I needed it. You are comparing school uniforms to putting people in a chamber and gassing them to death... Don't you think that is a tad melodramatic? Perhaps that was the point, but consider this: What exactly can you tell from a person's clothes? Generally speaking, the only thing you can tell about a person by their clothes is how much money they have. But what else? What else can you tell about a person based on their clothes? If a kid wants to wear a t-shirt with a pot leaf on it to advocate legalizing marijuana, why can't he just tell people he advocates legalizing marijuana? If a guy wears a Rolex, you know he has enough money to afford a Rolex (or good credit). What else? You don't know if he gives money to charity to help feed poor kids or if he hoards it for retirement. He could be an alcoholic that beats his wife or a loving husband and father. You can't tell if he is smart or stupid, gay or straight, confident or shy, outgoing or anti-social.

Same definition. Just because the number of things you are or are not allowed to wear varies, doesn't mean they are not the same concept at their core. \n\n \n Your definition of a uniform is correct....your understanding of a school dress code is not.\n In a uniform policy a student must wear (for example) khakis and blue or grey polo shirts.\n If a student following a dress code choose to wear brand new denim jeans and a pull over sweater....is that the same thing? If he transfered to the school with a uniform policy he would be in violation.\n If he decided to wear Black slacks a button down white shirt and a tie....he would have chosen to dress for success and yet been in violation of the uptight uniform policy.\n If a young lady elects to wear jeans and her favorite knit sweater and pulls her hair back into a french braid....she too would be in violation of a uniform policy....but not a dress code.\n These ideals are VERY different. The only simularities are that they talk about clothing!! \n MUST wear....as opposed to....Must NOT wear. \"Must not\" gives the individual the ability to find something that suits him or her in the large selection of colors, styles, fabrics and so forth.\n \n I can't beleive anyone on this thread would call the two sides of this arguement \"Surprise!

I know I didn't when I was a kid.\n\n \n I know you're only using Japan as an example but regardless of which country or society you choose to compare us with I think that the results stand for themselves. America has long been the world leader in innovation, industry and science.....just to name a few categories. The fact that the academic testing we use to base our kids progress against other nations doesn't seem to amount to much when it comes to real life...therefore, I don't think I want my kids emulating Japan or any other nation who's kids may be setting the test scores on fire but in the real world are playing catch-up to the free thinkers we produce.\n You can learn all you want about history and math but unless you're thinking outside the box you're not leading anything!!\n Listen....the real world isn't written down somewhere like a recipe for everyone to follow. Life changes ...and fast. Our school system (minus the violence) isn't producing less qualified students. It's the adults that develop the \"criteria\" for testing that are missing the point. That being the mark of a successful school system is that which produces productive members of society (which you said) but the truth is.....we are!! \n \n As far as the statement about our kids taking over our schools....to a degree I think you're right. We need more \"cause and effect\", more discipline, more awareness by our teachers and staff. We need to learn about and better understand our kids and staff our schools with proactive people that aren't still teaching like it was the 80's. This is a different culture....the schools & teachers need to adapt just as they always have had to. But....don't think that dressing them in a uniform will change that. Recoating a bad apple in shiny new red won't change the apple. You gotta get to the core of the problem and make REAL changes....not some visual effect.\n \n Daddy Man",

You don't just feed a kid information, the kid doesn't process it, and then spit it back out onto a test. You're oversimplifying the situation, although I applaud you trying.

Maybe I'm being a little too cocky here, but I can see the bad decisions that kids make, even the smallest ones. I can make a lot of decisions on my own. My parents trust me more then most parents trust their kids, and I rarely fail my parents in making good decisions. However, my rebellious streak comes in when I'm treated like a 5-year old.

   "Most kids are XXXXXX and will do idiotic things. I was a kid and I was an idiot. The last thing I would have wanted was for a bunch of old farts to come into the school and tell me that I couldn't wear what I wanted. I spent 4 years in ROTC and had a strict haircut code along with uniform requirements one day of the week. The rest of the time I was free to wear vans, Swatch, and other fashion crimes. The same old farts that would have imposed a dress code on me were guilty of bell bottoms. No generation that wore bell bottoms has moral authority over the fashions of another. \n \n I do not believe that you can legislate common sense or morality. If a kid wants to pierce his forehead and wear a shower curtain to school, hey, more power to him. Just don't come back to society with your hand out complaining about how the greedy rich won't hire you because you look like an industrial accident and lack basic skills. \n \n When dealing with teenagers, it is best to allow them to clothe themselves in a manner that gives you fair warning of who the XXXXXX are. You can normally draw some conclusions about an individual based on the care in which they put into their personal appearance. Put all the students in the same outfit and you have no idea who the functional ones are. If given the opportunity teenagers, like all herding animals, will want to be different, just like everyone else. Those who lack better judgment than to present themselves as random assortments of ill-fitted laundry inform you that their bulb is not of the highest wattage.\n \n This shooter fellow might have the worst taste in clothes imaginable, I don't know, but I can hardly see how imposing my dress code on him is going to transform him into anything but a resentful yute who looks for other ways to strike out an imposing society and to establish his own sense of identity.

I have never in my life determined how much money someone has by their clothes.\n\n \n You bring up an interesting point. When I was in school, kids with mohawks and spiked collars were considered \"punk rock\" not \"emo.\" It's pretty obvious that these types of labels are the result of shallow thinking. Fads and trends change like the seasons.\n \n The problem is your view is lmited because you haven't yet experienced the real world. High school is nothing like the real world. When you go to a job interview, if you show up in all black with a mohawk and a spiked collar, you probably aren't going to get the job.

You wanted forced uniforms in schools, last time I remember.\n \n See above. Thats pretty narrow minded thinking. \n\n \n Actually, it isn't narrow-minded thinking at all. I'm looking to the future.

I don't socialize with people when I'm at work. I am expected to be clean-shaven and well-dressed when I am work, as I am a representative of the company. This is the situation in the majority of decent jobs you will find. School should be looked at as the first step towards a professional environment. \n \n \nSorry to stop you here, but where is your evidence of that?

It was quite degrading to our self esteem.\n\n \n No, that is what you told yourself. If you feel controlled having to wear a uniform at school, wouldn't going to school itself make you feel controlled? That is a sad argument. I really don't understand how you think if you are wearing a uniform your opinions suddenly don't matter. In case you didn't realize, teachers and administrators ARE superior to you. The problem is that you don't understand this. It's also sad that your clothes affect your self-esteem. Are you really that shallow?

I consider myself to be more mature than some of my peers. Maybe I'm being a little too cocky here, but I can see the bad decisions that kids make, even the smallest ones. I can make a lot of decisions on my own. My parents trust me more then most parents trust their kids, and I rarely fail my parents in making good decisions. However, my rebellious streak comes in when I'm treated like a 5-year old. I deserve better than that. Don't treat us like 5-year olds and we won't act like them. Simple as that.\n\n \n Wrong. Kids make bad decisions no matter what. It doesn't matter if you are strict, a pushover, or somewhere in the middle. Kids are immature, inexperienced, and horrible decision makers. Brilliant kids with loving parents shoot up their school. Yous also pointed out the other problem. Kids like you think you are mature and make good decisions. Guess what? Most kids think that way. Ten years from now, you will look back on decisions you thought were good and say to yourself, \"I can't believe I did that.\" Everybody I know has.\n \n As a side note, it may surprise you to learn that I went to my senior prom dressed like a punk rocker. I had a ripped turquoise suit with safety pins all over it, spiked bleached hair, and Chucks. The next Monday, I had a teacher who I had never had a class with come up to me and say, \"My wife was talking about you all weekend long.\" The point is, the reasoning behind me wearing that was to basically give a big middle finger to the school. I guess deep sown inside, I just wish kids had some pride in their school and could actually get a decent education. I felt that public school had let me down, and I was angry.\n \n The bottom line is, the only somewhat-decent argument I have heard against school uniforms is that it violates freedom of speech.

   "Most kids are XXXXXX and will do idiotic things. I was a kid and I was an idiot. The last thing I would have wanted was for a bunch of old farts to come into the school and tell me that I couldn't wear what I wanted. I spent 4 years in ROTC and had a strict haircut code along with uniform requirements one day of the week. The rest of the time I was free to wear vans, Swatch, and other fashion crimes. The same old farts that would have imposed a dress code on me were guilty of bell bottoms. No generation that wore bell bottoms has moral authority over the fashions of another. \n \n I do not believe that you can legislate common sense or morality. If a kid wants to pierce his forehead and wear a shower curtain to school, hey, more power to him. Just don't come back to society with your hand out complaining about how the greedy rich won't hire you because you look like an industrial accident and lack basic skills. \n \n When dealing with teenagers, it is best to allow them to clothe themselves in a manner that gives you fair warning of who the XXXXXX are. You can normally draw some conclusions about an individual based on the care in which they put into their personal appearance. Put all the students in the same outfit and you have no idea who the functional ones are. If given the opportunity teenagers, like all herding animals, will want to be different, just like everyone else. Those who lack better judgment than to present themselves as random assortments of ill-fitted laundry inform you that their bulb is not of the highest wattage.\n \n This shooter fellow might have the worst taste in clothes imaginable, I don't know, but I can hardly see how imposing my dress code on him is going to transform him into anything but a resentful yute who looks for other ways to strike out an imposing society and to establish his own sense of identity. If dude gets a thrill out of wearing his pants down low so you can see his drawers, rave on man! Just don't be surprised when you think you look like an idiot 20 years later when flipping through the yearbook.\n\n \n This is actually the best point of view I have heard so far against school uniforms. The only problem is I don't believe you can really tell a whole lot about a person (especially as a kid, but even as an adult) just by what they wear. I know a girl who dressed like a hooker or hippie (those are her words) throughout all of school and she's going to graduate from law school in May.",

   "You bring up an interesting point. When I was in school, kids with mohawks and spiked collars were considered \"punk rock\" not \"emo.\" It's pretty obvious that these types of labels are the result of shallow thinking. Fads and trends change like the seasons.\n\n \n Faster than seasons.\n \n \n \n \nThe problem is your view is lmited because you haven't yet experienced the real world. High school is nothing like the real world. When you go to a job interview, if you show up in all black with a mohawk and a spiked collar, you probably aren't going to get the job. People aren't going to think of you as \"emo.\" They are going to think of you as immature and stupid.\n\n \n And how do you suppose kids are supposed to learn how to dress appropriately if they've only been wearing one thing for a long time?\n \n \n \n \n \nAgain, your frame of reference is kids. I'm talking about preparing kids to be adults in our society. Right now, our system treats kids the exact opposite of the way they will be treated as adults.\n\n \n Well then, we had a little misunderstanding.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nActually, it isn't narrow-minded thinking at all. I'm looking to the future. The two main purposes of school are education and preparation. We are doing a terrible job with both.\n\n \n Well, it could be worse, but it sure as hell could be a lot better. But then again, how far do you want to go with \"whatever means necessary to help our kids be educated\"? To the point of all liberties stripped? To the point of reverting back to corpral punishment? Maybe holding guns to their heads? Theres a common sense line that needs to be drawn.\n \n \n \n \n \nAre you saying you don't want schools to create productive, educated adults?\n\n \n And who says that holding kids at gunpoint won't make them more productive? I sure as hell think it would.\n \n \n \n \nI am saying Japan has a nationwide school uniform policy. The kids don't complain they are being forced or oppressed, and they score higher on tests than Americans. You figure it out.\n\n \n First of all, you can't compare the Japanese to the Americans. There is a HUGE cultural difference, and that would be like comparing an apple to an orange. Just because you like the taste of the orange better, doesn't mean the apple is bad. And to support my hypothesis, i bring up the gun issue. They have the most draconian gun laws in the world, and they have low crime. People draw the conclusion that less guns mean less crime, right? However, in Switzerland theres an AK in every house, and they also have very low crime. The states in the US with most gun control are notorious for crime. There is so much contradiction, that you can only draw the conclusion that it is due to cultural differences. I'm fine if you compare states educational test scores, but it means nothing to compare a foreign country.\n \n \n \n \n \nAre you a woman? Seriously. I go to work 5 days a week, 8 hours or more a day. I don't socialize with people when I'm at work. I am expected to be clean-shaven and well-dressed when I am work, as I am a representative of the company. This is the situation in the majority of decent jobs you will find. School should be looked at as the first step towards a professional environment.\n\n \n I agree, however you're not going to get fired or kicked out of school if you dress a bit different than everyone else. A job is awhile away from school, and you can't necessarily treat kids as full grown adults. They are not extremely different, but they are somewhat different, with different interests. Adults don't care AS MUCH about what they wear as kids around middle and high school do.\n \n \n \nNo, that is what you told yourself. If you feel controlled having to wear a uniform at school, wouldn't going to school itself make you feel controlled?\n\n \n No, because school is a necessary part of life. It helps prepare for later in life and is good for you. Uniforms serve no purpose, are stupid, and the only conclusion I can draw from them being forced on us is that it is a control thing.\n \n \n \nThat is a sad argument. I really don't understand how you think if you are wearing a uniform your opinions suddenly don't matter. In case you didn't realize, teachers and administrators ARE superior to you.\n\n \n Administrators and teachers are the equivelant of bosses. They, in this case, would be my boss. Bosses aren't superior to you, they just tell you what to do. Thats their job.\n \n \n \n \n \nThe problem is that you don't understand this. It's also sad that your clothes affect your self-esteem. Are you really that shallow? Are you nothing underneathe the clothes you wear?\n\n \n You obviously don't understand kids very well. I am someone underneath what I wear, but no one else will know that unless i strip naked and carry around a megaphone shouting about myself. Like they say, pictures say a thousand words. In this case, your clothes would be your picture.\n \n \n \n \nYou may as well just have typed \"blah blah blah\" here. It could have saved me some time.\n\n \n Is that your best response?\n \n \n \n \nYou're right. It's their bodies. We should go ahead and get rid of all the limits we impose on kids. Let em drink and smoke and buy porn! Why not? It's their body! Let's allow the kids to decide everything about school.\n\n \n You're comparing a kids clothes to drinking, smoking, and porn? If you're going to play it that way, show me specific evidence that show devastating physical and psycological impacts of dressing without uniforms, impacts as harmful as smoking and drinking and porn.\n \n \n \n \nI'm not sure the point you are making here. Taking in information, processing it, and spitting it back out on a test is exactly what kids do in school.\n\n \n And that is my problem with the public educations system.\n \n \n \n \nWrong. Kids make bad decisions no matter what. It doesn't matter if you are strict, a pushover, or somewhere in the middle.\n\n \n Wrong. I had a choice to do my homework. I chose to do it, and I'm pretty sure that was the right choice. I had a choice after school to eat junk food after school today, but I chose not to, and I'm pretty sure that was the right choice. I am faced with choices all the time, and most of the time I make the right ones, and when I don't, oh well, it sucks for me. But adults make wrong choices too. Kids judgement isn't as good as adult's, but that doesn't mean we always make wrong choices.\n \n \n \n \n \nKids are immature, inexperienced, and horrible decision makers. Brilliant kids with loving parents shoot up their school. Yous also pointed out the other problem. Kids like you think you are mature and make good decisions. Guess what? Most kids think that way. Ten years from now, you will look back on decisions you thought were good and say to yourself, \"I can't believe I did that.\" Everybody I know has.\n\n \n I'm running on advice from my parents. Unless they're somehow kids in disguise, or are retarted (which i'm sure they're not), i'm pretty sure I'm making the right decisions. When I make bad decisions, i know within a week. However, I guess we'll see in 10 years won't we?\n \n \n \n \nAs a side note, it may surprise you to learn that I went to my senior prom dressed like a punk rocker. I had a ripped turquoise suit with safety pins all over it, spiked bleached hair, and Chucks.

Interestingly enough, this came from the girl I went to the prom with.\n\n \n \n Although the first story is not an uncommon one in our society, I think you have the uniform thing backwards. If a new law is coming into place, such as an abortion ban, a gun ban, etc. The question is usually not \"why not?\" its \"why?\". The same goes for a uniform policy. Why? What purpose would they serve? If they prepare kids for later on in life, how do they do it? Where are your stats to back you up? What are your arguments? That sort of thing, plus, what do the people say who are disadvantaged or hurt by this new policy/law? They should have some say too.",

   "I happened to disagree with your \"logical conclusion\", however lets assume that you are correct in saying that uniforms do their job and are a very effective tool for controlling kids, making the learning environment more friendly, etc. Let me ask you this, what if putting uniforms on all black people showed promising statistics? Lowering crime, less vandalism, and it overall showed that it was a large benefit to society. Now, I don't mean to be racist, in fact I mean to be the exact opposite. However would you still be for uniforms in that case? The case that all black people should wear uniforms from certain hours to certain hours or while doing engaging in this or that or just all of the time. Would you still support them if the uniforms were for black people?\n \n Don't make me pull out Benjamin Franklin again:\n \n \"Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.\"\n \n Ben Franklin\n\n \n I did not say that uniforms were for the greater good. I was never attempting to answer whether or not uniforms are specifically a societal good. I was addressing Lady X specifically. She said that uniforms do not affect test scores and therefore should not be used. The item I was attempting to hit was that test scores are the only thing that matters. Uniforms do essentially remove a barrier from the learning environment. They do not necessarily increase test scores, however, they do contribute to eliminating \"social status\" problems on school grounds. They are not the end all be all decisive item, but it helps.\n \n Huck",

   "I might as well add my two cents :)\n \n First off I want to comment on something Shooterandproud said.\n \n \n\n First of all, you can't compare the Japanese to the Americans. There is a HUGE cultural difference, and that would be like comparing an apple to an orange. Just because you like the taste of the orange better, doesn't mean the apple is bad. And to support my hypothesis, i bring up the gun issue. They have the most draconian gun laws in the world, and they have low crime. People draw the conclusion that less guns mean less crime, right? However, in Switzerland theres an AK in every house, and they also have very low crime. The states in the US with most gun control are notorious for crime. There is so much contradiction, that you can only draw the conclusion that it is due to cultural differences. I'm fine if you compare states educational test scores, but it means nothing to compare a foreign country.\n\n This was in response to Japan and China having higher test scores. I agree with Shooter here that you can't compare the two (for this situation) and even if you do this doesn't show that uniforms are a good idea or are even helping. \n \n If you want to do a good comparison of Asian and US teaching then you need to look beyond the test scores. What about the abnormally high suicide rate for kids in school? What about the fact that they only teach to a test and never teach understanding or abstract/critical thinking. The book \"The Overachievers\" really nails home the messed up priority system of Asian schools.\n \n \n \n With regards to \"experience\" (as this has come up) I'd say those that are working now and out of school have a better understanding than students in school on this subject and almost all subjects debated here for that matter. This isn't to say you can't make a good point but students are very limited and so long as they understand a limitation exists you can have a fair debate.\n \n With this said, school uniforms haven't shown any benefit. A dress code does but school uniforms tend to backfire on the goals they seek.",

   "I would like to start this post by saying that uniforms are not constitutional!!!!! How some of you may ask... well, I tell you! The ninth amendment to The Constitution of The United States of America clearly states that \"The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\" My understanding of this is that certain basic rights of the people will not be take away, even if they are not specifically stated in the constitution. Well, if you use common sense, you can see that in some countries, people can only wear certain things (hence, a uniform). These countries also do not allow other basic rights (such as freedom of speech, etc.). Therefor, if several of the basic rights guaranteed under the constitution are permitted at school to some existent (ex. you can't cuss at school, talk back to teachers, etc.), then wouldn't it make since that to some existent, kids should be able to wear what they please as long as their parent(s)/legal guardian(s) approve of their clothing selection.\nI am not quite following your logic. I believe clothing falls under free speech. However, when uniforms are mandated, no one is telling anyone they can't wear this or that, but only limiting it within the context of public school. What they are saying is that the purpose of the school system is to teach kids, and they are permitted to make rules limiting free speech in order to achieve that purpose. If the school system believes that uniforms are one way to achieve that purpose, then I see nothing wrong with them and nothing unconstitutional going on. In fact, if an open dress code causes distraction during class that the teacher must deal with, then I might argue that the open dress code is interfering with my child's right to an education by forcing teachers to deal with such issues when they should be teaching.\n \n I don't see where it is any different than say in a courtroom - you can't just stand up and talk and say what you want. There are rules in place which limit free speech in the courtroom so that the court can achieve its stated purpose.",

   "Coed schools foster a better socio-learning environment\n\n \n Well, good luck to you sir! What a voyage you have set for yourself! You're either going to have to do A LOT of digging and crossreferencing to prove that CO-ED actually IMPROVES performance in schools. And just so you don't slither out of this, define for me the criteria for improving a \"socio-learning environment.\" When I was a kid I wanted to LEARN. I wasn't the brightest, but I sure as heck wanted something more substantial than what I was getting. (Except for Natural sciences - our physics, chemistry, and one math teacher were gods.) Women are a distraction. They almost always lack the passion for higher learning. They are very good at turning in their homework on time, knowing the dates of tests and studying for the prescribed 2 hours per subject, however they VERY RARELY read and self educate outside of what is prescribed by the school. Guys who read things other than romance novels, crappy pretensious poetry, or novels otherwise featured on oprah are considered freaks by most girls. Like reading some of the true sources of history like Tacitus or Cicero or Pliny the Elder? You get branded. WHY IS THIS? I have a theory. Women are not at all empassioned about learning or enlightment or gaining truth. Its about making mommy and daddy happy. Get them out of our schools! \n \n \n... and with no coed schools, YOU will have to pay more tax dollars to found more schools to accommodate each sex\n\n \n Yep, and it will be worth the price.\n \n \n....and schools would no longer be fun for children.\n\n \n Are you KIDDING me? No more fun? Learning and growing as a young man and being immersed in an enviornment removed from absurd distractions will be worse? Listen, I want my kid (dont have one yet, just saying) to get a good education! Not to be brainwashed and \"socialized\" to think of the president as a king, worship authority, disdain reading (you're brainwashed to think reading is good in of itself of course; however you're told this in such an insulting childish way that no one takes it seriously) and to be so unspeakably lazy that he doesn't even care to educate himself. Get your priorities straight - they're there to be challenged, to gain knowledge, to learn how to think critically, and to learn how to educate themselves; not to NECESSARILY have fun! God, we are so screwed if everyone is thinking like you.",

One, that means that gang members, being human beings, will stop at \"NOTHIG!!!!!!!!!\" to show that they are gang members. That shows that uniforms will not help that problem. Two, someone who could truely stop at nothing to express themselves but wish to do so only thur their clothing can no longer do so in front of the vast majority of their peers. \n \n On another note, I would like to point out that, wether we like it or not, schools have started to go down a bad path. Uniforms ar a way that people try to fix this. True, it has shown positive results, but, people on both sides of the arguement have stated that there have been mixed results. Therefore, I mainly see it as a way that some districts believe will work for them, but it CANNOT every be implemented as a state or federal policy, for the basic reason that different districts and people are different. I also feel that student should have a much greater say than what they get now on this subject. The government is a democracy( or is suposed to be) so why shouldn't something (like schools) that funded by the government be too? And I don't mean just throughing it in front of student council. I mean that every student gets to vote, even if they aren't there ( have them vote when they get back) and they should be able to abstinetane. Parents too, should have a say, it might just save a few school districts some court dates and thousands of dollars. The school boards should also be requirered to have resaerch and other data that supports a uniform for their school district. If all these benchmarks are met and the school distric get the go ahead from the poll results ( and it not MY school districtemoticon_xgood ) then I see no reason why they couldn't have a uniform. Except if some kids wish to tranfere to a next door schools district that dosen't have a unifrom, they should be permitted. That would be a good state policy, in my opinion.",

I know a school district in the Sacramento area went to a school uniform several years ago to help alleviate some of the problems that the middle and high schools were having. \n \n Many of the schools were reporting thefts, gang activity, and violence stemming from what people were wearing. When the district first announced the possibility of uniforms, many parents and students objected stating that the student has the right to wear what he/she wants and by wearing uniforms the school is taking away the student's individuality. The district ultimately put a uniform policy into affect and all students wear black pants and a white polo shirt.

   "Uniforms become common once you look outside of the school and into the job market. They are a symbol of unity and professionalism in the work place and can be used as such in schools as well. They can help create order, conformaty, and level the playing field for everyone especially in the area of rich vs poor. Is it going to make people smarter? Maybe. I think the way a person dresses will affect the way they act. A person dressed in a suit is more likely to act in a professional and intellegent way than a person dressed in casual wear. The result of this could be that the person will act more professional and conform to the learning atmosphere provided and in the long run that could help make them more informed.

   "[And what is the purpose of wearing uniforms at work? It is so that everyone will be considered the same. So that the service that you get from one person should be the same service that you would have received from anywhere else.]\n \n Exactly; the same thing goes for the students at school. While workers wear uniforms to offer the same service to all customers, students should wear uniforms to give and recieve the same service/treatment from one another, as well as the administration. This would set students on an equal footing and put more of the focus on learning.\n \n [How is it valid? If there is no dress code (and thus, no violations), and you implement one, how will the number of violations go down?]\n \n \n I am referring to the dress codes that are already in place in most schools. The fact is that these codes are just downright ineffective. There is not enough time in the day for each teacher to crack down on the large number of students who break these dress codes each and every day. Uniforms would eliminate so many violations because it is quite easy to see when a student has voilated the uniform policy. At a school where uniforms are enforced, the students are limited to how many ways they can violate the dress code. By wearing uniforms, students are set on their entire school wardrobe. The same shoes, bottoms, and tops are required; that's that. \n \n [But if you implement a uniform policy, parents will have to purchase that clothing for their children anyway. Then, on top of it, they will have to purchase clothing to meet the uniform policy.]\n \n Lets do the math. Students spend 180 days in school (about 1/2 the year). Schools with uniforms recommend that each student have 2 sets of uniforms. If students were to wear the same two outfits to public school every day they would be laughed out of class. The students at public school probably have about 16 different outfits(Without mixing and matching). To incorporate uniforms would be to decrease parent's spending for school uniforms by more than half that of a regular school year without uniforms. Even with the extra cost of clothing outside of school the total cost for parents would be much less.The greater amount originally set to spend for students would be replaced by a much smaller figure to purchase the uniforms for school.\n\n no you do the math uniforms are expensive!",

   "Mum and dad were saying again how they don't like school girls wearing tiny skirts to school. This is what I think on the issue:\n \n Girls were one of the highlights of being at school and if they made girls wear longer skirts boys would miss out on the fun of seeing girls in short skirts. That was one of the highlights. Plus school is boring enough without taking away one of the highlights.\n \n I don't believe in the word whore. That word is a piece of ####. If women who are prostitutes (who have sex safely) or escorts want to have sex in a job and look sexy then that is their choice. The word whore is an insult. You can't call schoolgirls whores because that is bad.\n \n Arguing that school girls uniforms should be made longer is also stupid when young girls and teenage girls go to nudist camps. No-one complains about that.\n \n The way I see it. People who are saying schoolgirls skirts should be made longer are gay and old fashioned. Girls in short skirts at school is one of the highlights and gives schoolboys an experience in the world of sex and sexy. It is a time when boys at high school start masterbating. That is another reason why schoolgirls should always wear very small skirts to school.\n \n Thankyou.\n \n If you want to contact me email me at abgop@aol.com or join me online on messenger with these addy's:\n \n MSN: ezrafire@hotmail.com\n YAHOO: smoogiemassive@yahoo.co.uk\n AOL OR AIM: abgop@aol.com\n \n Aron",

Think about it, drugs, violence, and the increasing rebellion with each decade as it goes by. I think that uniforms (whether right or wrong) have only been implemented in public schools in an attempt to control the rowdy kids that only act that way because there parents have not raised them correctly. I think (as conservative as this might sound) that we need some way to make the parents have a bigger burden of responcibility. Some of them oviously don't tink that raising their kid(s) is that important. We should make so that the parent(s) can't go to work if their kid(s) don't abide the laws or they have to take parenting classes throughout the kid(s) earlier life if they are found to not spend enough time with their child(ren).",

Some people argue that uniforms promote focus and stability throughout the private school, yet some others have argued that free dressing promotes freedom of expression and diversity. I am in fact, debating for the ladder at the moment. Although uniforms provide a sense of support that creates a very stable community, it does not allow children to express there feelings and ideas through there clothing. Although clothing is not the best method to express yourself through, for some it is the only way. Children will also argue against uniforms. However, free dressing is a way to expand and nourish the up-coming minds in society. Freedom of all expression = expansion and confidence.\n \n Good debate,\n Projekt",

   "Uniforms are about the worst thing they have forcefully put on these teenagers. What is the school system afraid of? Gangs? Trouble? Looking like a prostitute? First of all, gangs, are going to continue with or without uniforms. They are ALWAYS still gonna have some sort of code, or sign that which gang they are in. As for trouble, it's not because of the clothing they were, it's about how they are raised. These 'cliques' that teenagers come up with, there are still gonna see the 'geeks' as the geeks, the 'populars' as the populars, the 'gangsters' as the gangsters and so on. And adults, nor uniforms can change that. Teenagers are still going to wear what they want to wear, if it looks too over appealing, too high or too low, too baggy or too tight. They say that it's going to save money on school clothes. Do you know how much khakis cost? Or polos? And how easily they get dirty? It's even harder to look nice and appropriate when you just got out of gym/P.E. and you only have a couple of minutes to change. Schools are always explaining to students to be themselves. How do they do that with uniforms? It's not what they like. Sure, it saves time in the morning, but most students can put their clothes out before bed, or wake up earlier. Since uniforms, teenagers have gotten more dress code violations than what it was before. It's pathetic, principals and teachers are even getting so fustrated of it, that they are sending the students to ISS(In School Suspension) and even OSS(Out School Suspension), which is not right, or fair. Students get even more fustrated so they decide to ignore the dress code and get sent to the principals office everyday so they can miss school, be in suspension, and not have to care. Uniforms have no impact on teenagers AT ALL. \n Nothing is good about it besides the saving time.\n If parents wanted uniforms, they should be put in private schools.\n It only causes more trouble for everyone and more work for the teachers.\n PLUS, most of the schools make students have a MESH backpack, see-through, they still can't express themselves and they are expensive. They aren't even as many colors.",

   "Myth 1. \"They keep the kids from picking on each others economic status\" \n \n WRONG! Most schools don't care where you get the uniforms so now the kids say, \"My mom got mine at the GAP you got yours from Walmart\" or \"My mom drives a better car than yours\" or \"My dads a lawyer you don't have a dad so you're poor.\" Kids will ALWAYS try to find new ways to make each other feel bad. \n \n Myth 2. \"Uniforms make it easier for the kids to get dressed in the morning\". \n \n WRONG! Most students are so against the uniform that it is MORE of a struggle to get them dressed and out the door than ever.\n \n Myth 3. \"School uniforms save parents money\"\n \n WRONG! For those parents that shop in thrift shops it is not cheaper and more and more parents are doing this especially in the \"better area\" shops. AND the uniforms get ruined just like anything else and need replacing at the same rate.\n \n Myth 4. \"Some kids use baggy cloths to hide weapons and drugs.\"\n \n WRONG! You don't need baggy clothes to hide anything, people hide things in all kinds of places e.g. shoes, jacket pockets, rip in hidden areas of bags and pockets.\n \n Myth 5. \"School is in the 'business' of learning. School is the place where the next lawyers, bankers, CPA's and Doctors are given the fundamentals of working in this economy. One of the basics of our culture in the working world is conservative dressing, dress code, or even uniforms. \"\n \n WRONG! First, they are children, not little adults, they have plenty of time to learn \"adult\" ways, next: janitors, mechanics, and food prep people wear them not just the \"high careers of society\". School should be a relaxed learning environment, not a Russian boot camp as it is a proven fact children learn better in comfortable environments.\n \n Myth 6. \"Uniforms make it easy to identify kids who belong in the school and those that don't\"\n \n WRONG! How hard is it to change your shirt if there is something you're after?\n \n All in all, Children don't have many choices to make and wearing what they want to (within reason) is only one of a hand full that they do get to choose. \n \n ...and It can also be a Student Safety issue. \"For example: During a natural disaster (God Forbid) Earthquake, Tornado, etc,... How would a Parent I.D. their child? By the clothes that they were wearing, when they left home. What if a Senior decided to attack a 9th -or- 10th grade student. How would the victim describe the attacker? Let's see, Khaki Pants - Navy Blue Shirt - Brown Shoes. You get the picture\"\n \n ...also \"School is also the place where the next actors, writers, artists, politicians, inventors, designers and and musicians are trained. School uniforms send a clear early-life message to students that conformity is\n important and creativity is not, that authority is allowed to abuse it's power and constrain our constitutional right to free speech and expression. Students learn from uniforms that their individuality,\n political opinions and religious rights are unimportant, as is their education: students are regularly suspended for non compliance to the uniform code even if their school work is excellent. If\n uniform-requiring schools were actually in 'the business of learning' this would not occur.\"\n \n ..last but not least \"School uniforms will do nothing but cut down on a students individuality. A uniform is not the way to cut down on school violence. the only thing that will cut down on school violence is if parents would pay attention to their children and keep their children out of trouble and give them consequences when they disobey and not to let them run wild\"\n \n Last three valid points ( ...and ...also ...last but not least) are courtesy of fellow posters who also disagree with school uniform policies.",

   "Schools should not adapt uniforms.\n \n Most importantly, the majority of students would prefer to chose what they wear.\n \n Furthermore, unconfortable (most fancy clothes are in more childrens' opinions) uniforms would be much more of a distraction from learning than other peoples choices in clothing.\n \n Some feel that uniforms would take away from students creativity. Even if this is false, it does not mean there is any reason for uniforms.\n \n Uniforms would not decrese people making fun of each other. People will do it for other reasons anyway.\n \n Uniforms will encourage, not discourage rebelion.\n \n If uniforms are adapted, parents will have move clothes to buy for their children since they will still want clothes for after school and on weekends along with their uniform.\n \n The \"it gets them ready for real life\" is silly. Children don't need to wear uniforms for 13 years to learn how to wear uniforms.\n \n The idea that children make their own dress code may be true, but irrelevant, since that doesn't logicly lead to wearing uniforms. And children prefer the uniforms they get to chose.\n \n It only brings a school together in the sense that they look similar. It doesn't make anyone care more.\n \n Also, uniforms wouldn't decrese how much students get in trouble for what they wear, it would be more frequent for someone to break the rules if there was more to break.\n\n \n Students are not soldiers.\n \n Ludwik\n .",

   "The 2nd Amendments does allow the average Joe to own a fleet of attack helicopters.\n\n \n Ok then, in that case I will be going down to Wal Mart this weekend to pick me up a fleet of Apaches. Care to join me so you can get it through your thick skull that flying armed military hardware is not legal to buy or own?\n \n \nFreedom of speech does mean you can scream \"fire\" in a theater.\n \n \n Then you wouldn't mind joining me this weekend on a trip to the theater in which you'll do just that? Right after we get our \"legal\" armed helicopters.\n \n \nNo restriction of these rights is reasonable. As soon as we decide that a restriction is \"reasonable\" then we open up the door for the total elimination of the right depending on who decides what is or isn't \"reasonable.\"\n\n \n Quite simply the line has to be drawn somewhere. Your argument that any reasonable restriction can be viewed as unreasonable by someone is totally moot, since all freedom requires some restriction in order to protect the freedom of others. That being said, unless you can prove to me that allowing students to dress how they like will cause direct and irreparable harm to fellow students, your argument really doesn't apply. \n \n \nIf you want to argue uniforms in public schools are a violation of constitutional rights, fine, but that means you must argue every other uniform in every other setting is also a violation of constitutional rights.\n\n \n You're free to quit your job any time you want. You are not free to quit school. Since you are not free to quit school and therefore not free to take off your uniform, yes, it is a violation of one's constitutional rights.",
