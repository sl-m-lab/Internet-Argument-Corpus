   "Dan Gurly, RNC Field Director outted as gay. Found profile on Gay.com just before he deleted it. He later admitted to having posted his personal on the gay website. \n \n Look here for a copy of the now deleted personal profile. \n \n http://blogswarm.blogdrive.com/archive/591.html\n \n Why am I not suprised?",

He's supposedly a hardline republican. What's worse was the fact that he attempted to originally deny the Gay.com personal. He tried to say it was someone using his name, but later admitted to it being his. If you read the profile that was posted within the article, his personal profile goes against everything the RNC was supporting in Bush's platform. That's what I found so ironic.",
