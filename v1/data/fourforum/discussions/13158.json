UNITED STATES\n \n Now consider a different, somewhat special meaning of the word \"carry\"-a meaning upon which the linguistic arguments of petitioners and the dissent must rest. The Oxford English Dictionary's twenty-sixth definition of \"carry\" is \"bear, wear, hold up, or sustain, as one moves about; habitually to bear about with one.\" 2 Oxford English Dictionary, supra, at 921. Webster's defines \"carry\" as \"to move while supporting,\" not just in a vehicle, but also \"in one's hands or arms.\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary, supra, at 343. And Black's Law Dictionary defines the entire phrase \"carry arms or weapons\" as\n \n \"To wear, bear or carry them upon the person or in the clothing or in a pocket, for the purpose of use, or for the purpose of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive action in case of a conflict with another person.\" Black's Law Dictionary 214 (6th ed. 1990).\n \n These special definitions, however, do not purport to limit the \"carrying of arms\" to the circumstances they describe. No one doubts that one who bears arms on his person \"carries a weapon.\" But to say that is not to deny that one may also \"carry a weapon\" tied to the saddle of a horse or placed in a bag in a car.\n \n Nor is there any linguistic reason to think that Congress intended to limit the word \"carries\" in the statute to any of these special definitions. To the contrary, all these special definitions embody a form of an important, but secondary, meaning of \"carry,\" a meaning that suggests support rather than movement or transportation, as when, for example, a column \"carries\" the weight of an arch. 2 Oxford English Dictionary, supra, at 919, 921.",

   "Prominent conservative J. Harvie Wilkinson of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals compared Heller to Roe v. Wade and criticized it for its lack of adherence to conservative methodology:\n\n \n I personally think conservatives undermine their stated adherence to originalism with their moral opposition to abortion influencing their legal thinking with the \"it's not in the Constitution\" position. This position is in opposition to the maxim that the Bill of Rights is not the exhaustive listing of the citizen's rights and is a fruition of the Federalist's fears and warnings about the dangerousness of trying to list rights. \n \n Conservative opposition to Roe and abortion rights in general belie their supposed allegiance to the concept of a government with strictly limited powers -- for saying that a unenumerated right does not exist where no power is conferred to act in that arena is stating that no limits on government's power exist . . . That government power shall fill the void, not liberty.\n \n Scalia's error in Heller was trying to explain the 2nd as a historical entity instead of explaining SCOTUS's application of the Amendment in prior cases. Heller neither stated or established anything new; there never was a \"state\" or \"collective\" right aspect to the 2nd . . . It was always interpreted by SCOTUS to be an individual right exercisable, claimable and enforceable by individuals separately from any militia connection.\n \n I just wish Scalia had restated and relied on SCOTUS's prior holdings that the right is not created, granted or otherwise established by the Amendment so the right is not dependent in any manner upon the words of the Amendment . . . Why he engaged in the linguistic analysis I'll never know or understand. \n \n \nSupreme Court Justice Stevens also made a similar criticism. \"With emphasis on the word 'genuine,' Stevens said that 'a genuine judicial conservative' would not have inserted the Court into the 'political thicket' of the gun rights debate as Scalia had done.\" \n\n \n Is there a point here? Didn't the dissenting Justices all agree that the right is an individual right, claimable and enforceable by individuals? It is clear the Stevens dissent was focused on a misreading of Miller's holding and his just for gun rights metamorphosis supporting the illegitimate assumption that the government can exercise vast unspecified and unenumerated powers just because it feels like it.\n \n In Heller Stevens abandons his belief in Roe's \"prenumbra\" theory, that the Bill of Rights is just a rough outline of liberty interests that stand as examples of many others. I endorse Justice Harlan's dissent in Poe without Stevens' recent equivocation and find it to be a compelling argument in constitutional interpretation, since elevated to the opinion of the Court in a case which Stevens concurred:\n \"Neither the Bill of Rights nor the specific practices of States at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment marks the outer limits of the substantive sphere of liberty which the Fourteenth Amendment protects. See U.S. Const., Amdt. 9. As the second Justice Harlan recognized: '[T]he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution. This `liberty' is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property; the freedom of speech, press, and religion; the right to keep and bear arms; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures; and so on. It is a rational continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints, . . . and which also recognizes, what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must, that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their abridgment.'\"\n \n Casey v. Planned Parenthood, 505 U.S. 833, 848 (1992)\n This famous exposition is a long standing favorite of Stevens. He cited it in his dissent in Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 306-07 (1994). But he abandons his relationship with these ideals in Heller? Give me a break . . .\n \n Who's sacrificing his principles for policy? At least Scalia's error results in an outcome that is consistent with his fundamental beliefs. That can not be said for Stevens.\n \n Just for info sake, Harlan's dissent is also quoted in the plurality (Stevens concurring) in Moore v. City of East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 502 (1977) , it was originally written by Justice Harlan in his dissent in Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 543 (1961)\n \n \nIt probably would have been better if Scalia had said to himself when the case was brought before the court, \"There certainly is no consensus about the meaning of the Second Amendment and I, as an amateur historian, am certainly not going to force my own personal views on others. I will let the people decide through their elected representatives how much gun control is necessary in their own communities.\"\n\n \n And if that was the accepted rule for Constitutional interpretation we would still have Jim Crow and the 14th Amendment would be as useful as the 3rd.\n \n Total Fail on your part again Galileo . . .",

   "\"Conservative\" and \"liberal\" are words we throw around which have political connotations. This is after all how we tend to view the outcome of cases-which political side \"won\" or \"lost.\" \"Law and order issues\" like those in Heller, for example, can be very politicized, and so we call judges either \"conservative\" or \"liberal\" based upon how they rule on these law enforcement issues. \n \n But to understand why Justice Scalia is the dominant ideological force on the court today you have to look beyond this shallow \"conservative\" or \"liberal\" label, because Scalia tells us that for him the Constitution is not a \"conservative\" v. \"liberal\" issue. For Scalia the question is not a political \"what would Bush do\" as opposed to \"what would Obama do\" so much as it is what he believes the Constitution requires-and in this sense he is very consistent. \n \n And so if you look at Dickerson v. United States, 530 U.S. 428, 455 (2000) and Hudson v. Michigan, 547 U.S. 586, 586 (2006), for example, you find Scalia fitting the traditional \"conservative\" and \"law and order\" judge mould-ruling for law enforcement against the interest of the individual defendant-because each case dealt with judicially created rules limiting law enforcement actions which he believed the Constitution did not require.\n \n But Scalia has and will continue to violate the \"conservative\" political label when he believes the Constitution requires it. Take, for example, Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 67 (2004). In this case SCOTUS ruled against a judicially created rule that allowed the government to admit a \"hearsay\" statement against a defendant on the grounds that the statement had such a guarantee of reliability that there was no need to produce the actual witness. SCOTUS found this rule violated the 6th. Amendment right to confront and cross examine your accuser. \"Liberal\" justice Stevens, as expected, was in the majority in this case. What was unexpected by many, however, was that \"conservative\" justice Scalia wrote the majority opinion (and thereby joined forces with his perceived \"liberal arch nemesis\" justice Stevens.) But in reality Scalia merely reaffirms his view that the Constitution binds all branches of government-and that in this case the right to confront and cross examine your accusers cannot be set aside by a judicial rule: \n \n The Constitution prescribes a procedure for determining the reliability of testimony in criminal trials, and we, no less than the state courts, lack authority to replace it with one of our own devising.\n \n And so you can see it is not what is good for \"conservatives\" or bad for \"liberals,\" it is what he feels the Constitution demands. We saw it this year when Scalia joined forces yet again with Justice Stevens in Arizona v. Gant, 556 U.S. ___ 07542, II (2009), in which both justices agreed that the 4th. Amendment did not permit a \"search incident to arrest\" of a car after a defendant has been taken out of it and stuffed into a police cruiser. People who view Scalia only as a \"conservative\" could never have guessed that he would have joined with \"liberal\" justice Stevens on this issue. \n \n And Scalia's \"what does the constitution demand\" view is consistent regardless of the political consequences. Two months ago Scalia issued the majority opinion of Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U.S. ___ 07591, 12 (2009) (again dragging \"liberal\" Justice Stevens along with him in his wake). For decades we have proved drug cases by having a scientist who tests the drug submit an affidavit which says \"its cocaine\" or \"its marijuana\"-without having to call the scientist to testify about his findings. In Melendez-Diaz Scalia and Stevens both agree that this practice violates the Constitution's 6th. Amendment right to confront and cross examine witnesses giving evidence against you. Now in my state, for example, a mere handful of scientists each test thousands of drug samples every year, and the effect of forcing them to come to court for each case has created utter chaos for law enforcement's ability to prosecute drug offenders. But for Scalia it's not a question of what are the political or practical ramifications of a ruling. It's about what he feels the Constitution demands: \n \n Respondent and the dissent may be right that there are other ways - and in some cases better ways - to challenge or verify the results of a forensic test.5 But the Constitution guarantees one way: confrontation. We do not have license to suspend the Confrontation Clause when a preferable trial strategy is available.\n \n Now before we go further bear in mind that District Of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. ___ 07290 (2008) was a \"crime control\" and \"law and order\" case. Galileo suggests the following should have occurred when Heller arrived at SCOTUS' door step:\n \n \nIt probably would have been better if Scalia had said to himself when the case was brought before the court, \"There certainly is no consensus about the meaning of the Second Amendment and I, as an amateur historian, am certainly not going to force my own personal views on others. I will let the people decide through their elected representatives how much gun control is necessary in their own communities.\" \n\n \n I disagree. It is precisely the role of SCOTUS to interpret and apply the Constitution. You cannot ask SCOTUS to abandon its function and have the justices wring their hands in dismay because there is not a universal consensus as to how they should rule before they take up a case. It is not the duty of SCOTUS to wait for the legislature to reach a consensus decision about the Constitution and then merely act as a rubber stamp to ratify that consensus. Instead, I believe SCOTUS has the duty to enforce and defend the Constitution regardless of the political consequences-and I believe it did so in Heller: \n \n We are aware of the problem of handgun violence in this country, and we take seriously the concerns raised by the many amici who believe that prohibition of handgun ownership is a solution. The Constitution leaves the District of Columbia a variety of tools for combating that problem, including some measures regulating handguns, see supra, at 54-55, and n. 26. But the enshrinement of constitutional rights necessarily takes certain policy choices off the table. These include the absolute prohibition of handguns held and used for self-defense in the home. Undoubtedly some think that the Second Amendment is outmoded in a society where our standing army is the pride of our Nation, where well-trained police forces provide personal security, and where gun violence is a serious problem. That is perhaps debatable, but what is not debatable is that it is not the role of this Court to pronounce the Second Amendment extinct.\n \n And it is most certainly not the role of a judge to pick and choose which parts of the Constitution he personally thinks are worth protecting today:\n \n We know of no other enumerated constitutional right whose core protection has been subjected to a freestanding \"interest-balancing\" approach. The very enumeration of the right takes out of the hands of government - even the [Slip Op. 63] Third Branch of Government - the power to decide on a case-by-case basis whether the right is really worth insisting upon. A constitutional guarantee subject to future judges' assessments of its usefulness is no constitutional guarantee at all. Constitutional rights are enshrined with the scope they were understood to have when the people adopted them, whether or not future legislatures or (yes) even future judges think that scope too broad. We would not apply an \"interest-balancing\" approach to the prohibition of a peaceful neo-Nazi march through Skokie. See National Socialist Party of America v. Skokie, 432 U.S. 43 (1977) (per curiam). The First Amendment contains the freedom-of-speech guarantee that the people ratified, which included exceptions for obscenity, libel, and disclosure of state secrets, but not for the expression of extremely unpopular and wrong-headed views. The Second Amendment is no different. Like the First, it is the very product of an interest-balancing by the people - which JUSTICE BREYER would now conduct for them anew. And whatever else it leaves to future evaluation, it surely elevates above all other interests the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.\n \n Now let me turn to Justice Stevens and his complaint that that 'a genuine judicial conservative' would not have inserted the Court into the 'political thicket' of the gun rights debate as Scalia had done.\" Apparently justice Stevens believes that only he should have the power to insert the Court into matters which have political import. Regardless of who inserts the Court into these issues, however, I believe that the justices should not abandon their principles to reach the outcome they desire-as I believe Stevens did.\n \n I mean really, using a linguistics professor to justify setting the two clauses of the 2nd. amendment in opposition against each other? In the history of SCOTUS case law there is no other example of a justice attempting such a ridiculous thing. It is little wonder that Scalia heaped such scorn on Stevens' attempt to use the militia clause as a shackle to limit the words \"bear arms\":\n \n A purposive qualifying phrase that contradicts the word or phrase it modifies is unknown this side of the looking glass (except, apparently, in some courses on Linguistics). \n \n Now Rick OShea has already discussed how justice Stevens was forced to abandon his decades of reliance on the penumbra doctrine to reach his tortured decision in Heller, so I will not comment on that further. \n \n But I did have one more example of doublethink I wanted to point out in Heller. In Heller, Justice Stevens writes a dissenting opinion which is joined by justices Ginsberg and Souter. In that opinion, the three justices decide that the term \"bear arms\" can only mean to do so in a military context:\n \n The term \"bear arms\" is a familiar idiom; when used unadorned by any additional words, its meaning is \"to serve as a soldier, do military service, fight.\n \n (of course, they already ignore that the term \"bear arms\" is in reality \"adorned by additional words\"-namely, \"to keep and bear arms.\" But then again, who cares about having to use all the words when you have a linguistics professor at your disposal to parse them into what you want them to say?) \n \n Justice Scalia, however, remembered when justices Ginsburg and Souter were with him on this issue previously. He remembered an earlier occasion when together they had adopted very different language to define the term \"bear arms\" in the 2nd. Amendment-language that placed the term well outside of a military-only context. That prior case was Muscarello v. United States, 524 U.S. 125 (1998), in which Ginsburg wrote a dissent joined by both Scalia and Souter. In Heller, Scalia gently chides the reversal of their previous position on the term \"bear arms\" by noting (of Ginsburg's opinion in Muscarallo):\n \n We think that JUSTICE GINSBURG accurately captured the natural meaning of \"bear arms.\"\n \n This, in turn, led Stevens/Ginsburg/Souter to petulantly complain in Heller:\n \n The Court's repeated citation to the dissenting opinion in Muscarello v. United States, 524 U.S. 125 (1998), ante, at 10, 13, as illuminating the meaning of \"bear arms,\" borders on the risible. At issue in Muscarello was the proper construction of the word \"carries\" in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (2000 ed. and Supp. V); the dissent in that case made passing reference to the Second Amendment only in the course of observing that both the Constitution and Black's Law Dictionary suggested that something more active than placement of a gun in a glove compartment might be meant by the phrase \"'carries a firearm.'\" 524 U.S., at 143.\n \n Now it is true that Muscarello didn't have anything to do with the 2nd. Amendment-it dealt with how to define the word \"carry\" in a firearm possession statute passed by Congress. But read for yourself Justice Ginsburg's dissent, as adopted by Souter and Scalia, and tell me whether what they said then can be squared with the \"military only\" definition of \"bear arms\" that Ginsburg and Souter chose to later adopted in Heller: \n \n Unlike the Court, I do not think dictionaries,2 surveys of press reports,3 or the Bible4 tell us, dispositively, what \"carries\" [Page 143] means embedded in \u00a7 924(c)(1). On definitions, \"carry\" in legal formulations could mean, inter alia, transport, possess, have in stock, prolong (carry over), be infectious, or wear or bear on one's person.5 At issue here is not \"carries\" at large but \"carries a firearm.\" The Court's computer search of newspapers is revealing in this light. Carrying guns in a car showed up as the meaning \"perhaps more than one-third\" of the time. Ante, at 129. One is left to wonder what meaning showed up some two-thirds of the time. Surely a most familiar meaning is, as the Constitution's Second Amendment (\"keep and bear Arms\") (emphasis added) and Black's Law Dictionary, at 214, indicate: \"wear, bear, or carry . . . upon the person or in the clothing or in a pocket, for the purpose . . . of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive action in a case of conflict with another person.\" Muscarello v. United States, 524 U.S. 125, 142-143 (1998) JUSTICE GINSBURG, dissenting, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE SCALIA, and JUSTICE SOUTER joined. (Note: the bold emphasis was by me. I italicize all quotes from the court to prevent them from being confused with my own words. In the original Ginsburg italicized the word \"bear\" for emphasis)\n \n \n Now I ask, Galileo, which of the justices stayed true to their core beliefs in Heller?\n \n ---\n \n The issue, however, is not whether court rules are \"mutable\"; they assuredly are. It is not whether, in the light of \"various circumstances,\" they can be \"modifi[ed]\"; they assuredly can. The issue is whether, as mutated and modified, they must make sense. The requirement that they do so is the only thing that prevents this Court from being some sort of nine-headed Caesar, giving thumbs-up or thumbs-down to whatever outcome, case by case, suits or offends its collective fancy.

   "Old Sarge, wasant the national guard made in the early 20th century yet the constitution was written in 1776?\n \n So they believe that all the amendments apply to everybody except for the 2nd. Talk about twisted logic (sorry logic is the wrong word!\n\n \n Correct, 1903 if I remember correctly. What the Dick Act did was to put into law what exactly the militia is. The organized part is by law the National Guard and its members. The unorganized part is by law the rest of the population. What the slavers failed to realize is that the phoney argument that the 2nd meant that the states could have a militia had the legs chopped off by law. Ignoring the law doesn't make it go away. Why no one has challenged the gun control slavery laws as violations of the Dick Act I have no idea. \n \n Logic plays no part on the left. Its feelings driven. One would wonder that out of the first ten amendments one was a states right while the rest were individual ones. ",

The people know that their value judgments are quite as good as those taught in any law school -- maybe better.

Wade is about finding legal precedent for the murder of unborn children.\n \n I see absolutely no comparison between the two.\n \n \nFor example, Scalia stated in Heller:\n \n \"Nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on long-standing prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.\"\n\n \n That's because these questions were never, ever, EVER raised in the original Parker case. None of the six DC people who took the city to court possessed a felony record, they didn't bring up anything other than the fact that DC made it impossible for them to legally buy and own a handgun. That's all the court addressed. If they addressed anything else in the Heller case it would've been judicial activism, legislating from the bench.\n \n \nHowever, the text of the Constitution has as much to say about such restrictions as it does about abortion. I've heard that Scalia has been criticized for making such a statement because there is no clear historical precedent dating back 200 years of banning felons from owning firearms. So neither the text of the Second Amendment nor tradition justifies such restrictions.

I asked you to back up your claim that gun control is racist. That is not asking others to do my work for me. That is asking you to back up a claim that you made.\n\n \n So the \"black codes\" of the South wasn't enough evidence for you?\n \n The neonazi organizations, even with Hitler long dead, are still a racist, white supremacist, kill any minority you don't like, organization. Time hasn't changed them one bit from one the original nazi party stood for.\n \n If time hasn't changed the nazis, of the KKK, why would time change what gun control was all about; keeping blacks from being able to be truly free?\n \n \nStevens said that bear arms has a military meaning.

In any event, even if we considered the prologue\n along with the operative provision we would reach the same result we\n do today, since (as we explain) our interpretation of &#8220;the right of the\n people to keep and bear arms&#8221; furthers the purpose of an effective\n militia no less than (indeed, more than) the dissent&#8217;s interpretation.\n See infra, at 26&#8211;27.\n 5 JUSTICE STEVENS is of course correct, post, at 10, that the right to\n assemble cannot be exercised alone, but it is still an individual right,\n and not one conditioned upon membership in some defined &#8220;assembly,&#8221;\n as he contends the right to bear arms is conditioned upon membership in a defined militia. And JUSTICE STEVENS is dead wrong to think that\n the right to petition is &#8220;primarily collective in nature.&#8221; Ibid. See\n McDonald v. Smith, 472 U. S. 479, 482&#8211;484 (1985) (describing historical\n origins of right to petition).\"\n \n DC v. Heller\n Pages 8 and 9\n \n \nSo? My source is more recent. Wouldn't it make more sense to use a more recent source to determine whose side he is currently on?\n \n \n Then find him voicing his support for DC's unconstitutional gun control laws, and his claim that they should've been allowed to remain on the books.\n \n \nNo, I'm only talking about in cases when the question is left unresolved by the text of the Constitution.\n\n \n No, you're talking about implementing a system where your constitutional rights end at the border of your state, or even your city of residence.\n \n And if you truly meant what you just said, then you would've said it in your previous post instead of claiming it here and now.\n \n It's the job of the Supreme Court to make the ultimate decision on what is constitutional, what the constitution means and how it applies. It's not for the Supreme Court to say \"This isn't a matter we should be weighing in on, individual governments should make the determination instead of us.\"",
