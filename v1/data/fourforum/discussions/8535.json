If you're not ready, but wish for your name to be on the roll call anyway, then feel free to come register. Be sure to email or text message family, friends, neighbors and/or associates about our roll call. If they don't hear, then how will they know or be saved?\n \n Each name not on our Lord's roll call will be left behind when our Lord arrives to pick us up.\n \n Amen!\n \n Prov14:35 The king's favour is toward a wise servant: but his wrath is against him that causeth shame",
