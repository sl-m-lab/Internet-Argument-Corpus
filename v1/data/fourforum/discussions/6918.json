   "http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/23/international/europe/23vatican.html\n \n November 23, 2005\n In Strong Terms, Rome Is to Ban Gays as Priests\n By IAN FISHER and LAURIE GOODSTEIN\n ROME, Nov. 22 - A new Vatican document excludes from the priesthood most gay men, with few exceptions, banning in strong and specific language candidates \"who are actively homosexual, have deep-seated homosexual tendencies, or support the so-called 'gay culture.' \" \n \n The long-awaited document, which has leaked out in sections over the last few months, was published Tuesday in Italian by an Italian Catholic Web site, AdistaOnline.it. \n \n The document appears to allow ordination only for candidates who experienced \"transitory\" homosexual tendencies that were \"clearly overcome\" at least three years before ordination as a deacon, the last step before priesthood. It does not define \"overcome.\" Several critics worried that that language would make it nearly impossible for men who believe their basic orientation is gay - but who are celibate - to become priests. \n \n The anticipation of the document has divided Catholics, especially in the United States, igniting contentious debate over whether this is an appropriate response to the recent sex scandals and whether celibate gay men can still be good priests. \n \n On both sides of that divide, there was general agreement on Tuesday night that the document presented a strong deterrent to homosexual men, but with some limited room for seminaries to make exceptions. \n \n The document puts the onus on bishops, seminary directors and the spiritual advisers \"to evaluate all of the qualities of the personality and assure that the candidate does not have sexual disorders that are incompatible with priesthood.\"\n \n A candidate, in turn, would have to be honest about his sexuality. \n \n \"It would be gravely dishonest for a candidate to hide his own homosexuality, regardless of everything, to arrive at ordination,\" the document states. \"Such an inauthentic attitude does not correspond to the spirit of truth, loyalty and availability that must characterize the personality of one who considers himself called to serve Christ.\"\n \n Vatican spokesmen refused to comment Tuesday, saying the document would be published on Nov. 29. \n \n But an Italian reporter, Andrea Tornielli, a Vatican specialist for Il Giornale who saw the entire document two weeks ago, said the Adista document matched the one he saw. An anonymous church official was quoted by The Associated Press as saying the document, a short five pages with footnotes, was genuine. \n \n While church documents as early as 1961 banned homosexuals from the priesthood, conservative Catholics complain that the ban has often been ignored. Some liberals say the priesthood has been enriched, and amplified in numbers, by gay celibate men. \n \n Thus many conservatives called the document a necessary correction, saying the number of gay men in seminaries has deterred heterosexual men from applying. \n \n \"I don't think it's anything new or different from the church's constant teaching, but it's new in the sense that the teaching has been widely disregarded in seminaries,\" said the Rev. Joseph Fessio, editor of Ignatius Press, which published many of Pope Benedict XVI's books before he was elected last April. \n \n The document draws a clear line at banning active gays, and what many experts said was a less clear one banning candidates with \"deep-seated homosexual tendencies,\" while leaving the term undefined. Generally, it says, homosexuals \"find themselves in a situation that seriously obstructs them from properly relating to men and women.\"\n \n \"It's a clear statement by the Vatican that gay men are not welcome in seminaries and religious orders,\" said the Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit priest and author of \"In Good Company: the Fast Track from the Corporate World to Poverty, Chastity and Obedience\" (Rowman & Littlefield, 2000).\n \n \"It raises the bar so high that it would be difficult to imagine gay men feeling encouraged to pursue a life in the priesthood,\" he added. \"It's a very stringent set of rules they're applying. Really the only people that would be able to enter, according to the document, would be people who had a fleeting homosexual attraction.\"\n \n (Continued)",

   "Francis DiBernardo, executive director of New Ways Ministry, which advocates the inclusion of gays in the Catholic Church, said, \"It seems that its intent is really to keep homosexuality quiet, to silence gay priests and gay seminarians.\" Such secrecy, he said, will make it even harder to find candidates who are well adjusted and sexually mature.\n \n But the Rev. Mark Francis, superior general of the Clerics of Saint Viator, a religious order based in Rome, said the document appeared to allow the leeway to ordain a candidate who believed he was gay but also believed he could be celibate. \n \n \"You could say, 'I believe I am gay, but that the tendencies toward being gay are not deep-seated,' \" he said. \"What constitutes deep-seated homosexual tendencies?\" he said. \"How does one judge that?\" \n \n Critics complain that by discouraging gay men from applying, it will alter the makeup of the priesthood, and possibly reduce its numbers at a time of an already acute shortage. Supporters maintain, however, that the priesthood needs to change, though Father Fessio said he worried whether that would actually happen. \n \n \"It depends on whether it's implemented or not,\" he said. \"Will it be obeyed? I don't know. I've read a lot of documents in the past that weren't.\"\n \n The document is marked as signed on Nov. 4 by Cardinal Zenon Grocholewski, prefect for the Congregation for Catholic Education, the Vatican department that oversees seminaries. It says that on Aug. 31, Benedict \"approved the instruction and ordered its publication.\" \n \n While the document has been in the works for years, begun under Pope John Paul II, its release marks one of the most significant acts in Benedict's seven months as pope. \n \n A doctrinal conservative who served as John Paul's defender of the faith for two decades, he spoke out before his election against \"filth\" in the church, which many observers speculated was a reference to the need to clean up the church after the scandals involving sexually abusive priests. \n \n Some critics both in and out of the church have accused the Vatican of using gay priests as a scapegoat for that scandal, a charge the church has vigorously denied. Experts have noted that is incorrect to equate pedophilia with homosexuality.\n \n The document concerns only candidates for the priesthood, not already ordained priests. But in anticipation of the document's release, a handful of priests have publicly declared their homosexuality, and a few bishops and leaders of religious orders have spoken out in defense of their gay priests.\n \n The president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Bishop William S. Skylstad of Spokane, Wash., wrote in his diocesan newspaper in October: \"There are many wonderful and excellent priests in the church who have a gay orientation, are chaste and celibate, and are very effective ministers of the Gospel. Witch hunts and gay bashing have no place in the Church.\"\n \n Bishop Matthew H. Clark, of Rochester, addressing any \"gay young men who are considering a vocation to priesthood,\" wrote: \"We try to treat all inquiries fairly. You will be no exception.\" \n \n Ian Fisher reported from Rome for this article, and Laurie Goodstein from New York. Elisabetta Povoledo contributed reporting from Rome.",

   "http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/24/politics/24priest.html\n \n November 24, 2005\n Priests Citing New Problem in Gay Policy \n By LAURIE GOODSTEIN\n A day after the disclosure of a new Vatican directive that deters most gay men from joining the priesthood, some priests say they are shocked by one easily overlooked clause. It says that spiritual directors and confessors in seminaries \"have the duty to dissuade\" any candidates \"who show deep-seated homosexual tendencies\" from joining the priesthood. \n \n These priests said this would turn the confessional and spiritual counseling sessions, which seminarians previously regarded as private and supportive meetings, into a tool for weeding gay men out of seminaries.\n \n \"The relationship between a seminarian and his confessor or his spiritual director should not be about enforcing church documents, but to serve as spiritual guides,\" said the Rev. Michael Herman, a priest in the Archdiocese of Chicago who has recently publicly identified himself as gay in order to speak out against the Vatican's action. \n \n \"They've gone so far as to say your confessor's and spiritual adviser's role is to talk you out of\" becoming a priest, Father Herman said.\n \n His reaction to the document was echoed by other priests and Roman Catholic organizations, who said that the church's decree was discriminatory and hurtful to faithful chaste gay priests and would only exacerbate an already dire shortage of Catholic clergymen.\n \n But that was only one reaction to a Vatican directive that church experts say is intentionally sprinkled with undefined terms and left open to interpretation.\n \n Some priests and church officials welcomed the document as a corrective to what they call a gay subculture in some seminaries. Others said it merely restated an existing policy and would have far less impact than advocates of gay priests and their opponents have claimed. \n \n \"There is nothing in this document that would require a change in the current practice,\" said the Rev. James Bretzke, chairman of theology and religious studies at the University of San Francisco.\n \n Father Bretzke said it had long been true that some American bishops and superiors who lead religious orders would automatically disqualify candidates for the priesthood who claimed a gay orientation, while other bishops would consider them. \n \n \"Unless you get a critical mass of bishops and religious superiors who say, Now we can't admit any gay men, I don't think it's going to have any discernible effect,\" Father Bretzke said. \"There are lots of excellent gay priests and seminarians, and we have a priest shortage. We're not exactly in a buyer's market here. If you're not going to ordain gay men, and not going to ordain married men, and not going to ordain women, well then who's left? It's not exactly a big pool.\"\n \n Estimates of the percentage of priests who are gay have varied from as low as 10 percent to as high as 60 percent. The directive applies only to seminarians, not to priests.\n \n The document, written in Italian, was posted on an Italian Catholic Web site on Tuesday, one week before the Vatican was set to formally release it in Rome. It was signed by the heads of the Vatican office that oversees Catholic education and approved by Pope Benedict XVI. \n \n Vatican documents dating as far back as 1961 have proclaimed that the church should not ordain gay men. But this document goes further in saying that a chain of church officials have the responsibility to make a \"morally certain judgment\" about whether a candidate's sexuality would disqualify him. \n \n \"The church, even while deeply respecting the persons in question, cannot admit to seminary or Holy Orders those who are actively homosexual, have deep-seated homosexual tendencies, or support the so-called gay culture,\" it says in one key passage. \"Such people, in fact, find themselves in a situation that seriously obstructs them from properly relating to men and women.\"\n \n The document does not define \"deep-seated homosexual tendencies,\" and the meaning was debated yesterday. \n \n The Rev. Richard John Neuhaus, editor of First Things, a conservative journal about religion and public life, said the Vatican was referring to \"dominant or exclusive same-sex desires.\" Father Bretzke, at the University of San Francisco, said the Vatican meant \"activities\" like frequenting gay bath houses or bars, or looking at Internet pornography. \n \n The Rev. Stephen P. Rossetti, a psychologist and president of St. Luke Institute in Silver Spring, Md., said bishops would require further consultations before they knew how to apply the document. \n \n The document is clear, however, about the role of the spiritual director - a priest, a nun or even a trained lay person assigned to each seminarian to talk with him about his spiritual life, in meetings that are supposed to be private and confidential. \n \n \"If a candidate is actively homosexual or shows deep-seated homosexual tendencies, his spiritual director, as well as his confessor, has the duty to dissuade him, in conscience, from proceeding towards ordination,\" it says. It does not suggest that spiritual directors violate confidentiality or inform others of the candidate's homosexuality.\n \n One gay priest in Boston who said he was afraid to be identified because of the current climate said his spiritual director knew of his sexuality and \"in fact encouraged me to proceed toward ordination.\" \n \n This priest, who is now himself a spiritual director, said that if a gay man told him he wanted to join the priesthood, \"I would evaluate him on the basis of the whole person.\"\n \n \"The job of spiritual director is not to turn people away from vocation but to help them understand what God is calling them to do,\" he said.\n \n At least one gay seminarian has already quit in anticipation of the document's release. Tim Powers, 30, said he left Holy Name College in Washington in October because he was struggling with celibacy and wanted to live a more honest life. Mr. Powers said he talked with his spiritual director about his conflict. \n \n \"Both she and I realized that it was something I had to try and figure out in a way that was both authentic and had some integrity to it,\" he said. \"The leaving part was really something I decided on my own.\"",

   "The Didache (written before 120AD)\n \"You shall not commit murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not commit pederasty, you shall not commit fornication, you shall not steal, you shall not practice magic, you shall not practice witchcraft, you shall not murder a child by abortion nor kill one that has been born\" (Didache 2:2 [A.D. 70]). \n \n Justin Martyr\n \"[W]e have been taught that to expose newly-born children is the part of wicked men; and this we have been taught lest we should do anyone harm and lest we should sin against God, first, because we see that almost all so exposed (not only the girls, but also the males) are brought up to prostitution. And for this pollution a multitude of females and hermaphrodites, and those who commit unmentionable iniquities, are found in every nation. And you receive the hire of these, and duty and taxes from them, whom you ought to exterminate from your realm. And anyone who uses such persons, besides the godless and infamous and impure intercourse, may possibly be having intercourse with his own child, or relative, or brother. And there are some who prostitute even their own children and wives, and some are openly mutilated for the purpose of sodomy; and they refer these mysteries to the mother of the gods\" (First Apology 27 [A.D. 151]). \n \n Clement of Alexandria\n \"All honor to that king of the Scythians, whoever Anacharsis was, who shot with an arrow one of his subjects who imitated among the Scythians the mystery of the mother of the gods . . . condemning him as having become effeminate among the Greeks, and a teacher of the disease of effeminacy to the rest of the Scythians\" (Exhortation to the Greeks 2 [A.D. 190]). \n \n \"[According to Greek myth] Baubo [a female native of Eleusis] having received [the goddess] Demeter hospitably, reached to her a refreshing draught; and on her refusing it, not having any inclination to drink (for she was very sad), and Baubo having become annoyed, thinking herself slighted, uncovered her shame, and exhibited her nudity to the goddess. Demeter is delighted with the sight&#8212;pleased, I repeat, at the spectacle. These are the secret mysteries of the Athenians; these Orpheus records\" (ibid.). \n \n \"It is not, then, without reason that the poets call him [Hercules] a cruel wretch and a nefarious scoundrel. It were tedious to recount his adulteries of all sorts, and debauching of boys. For your gods did not even abstain from boys, one having loved Hylas, another Hyacinthus, another Pelops, another Chrysippus, another Ganymede. Let such gods as these be worshipped by your wives, and let them pray that their husbands be such as these&#8212;so temperate; that, emulating them in the same practices, they may be like the gods. Such gods let your boys be trained to worship, that they may grow up to be men with the accursed likeness of fornication on them received from the gods\" (ibid.). \n ... \n \"In accordance with these remarks, conversation about deeds of wickedness is appropriately termed filthy [shameful] speaking, as talk about adultery and pederasty and the like\" (The Instructor 6, ca. A.D. 193). \n \n \"The fate of the Sodomites was judgment to those who had done wrong, instruction to those who hear. The Sodomites having, through much luxury, fallen into uncleanness, practicing adultery shamelessly, and burning with insane love for boys; the All-seeing Word, whose notice those who commit impieties cannot escape, cast his eye on them. Nor did the sleepless guard of humanity observe their licentiousness in silence; but dissuading us from the imitation of them, and training us up to his own temperance, and falling on some sinners, lest lust being unavenged, should break loose from all the restraints of fear, ordered Sodom to be burned, \n pouring forth a little of the sagacious fire on licentiousness; lest lust, through want of punishment, should throw wide the gates to those that were rushing into voluptuousness. Accordingly, the just punishment of the Sodomites became to men an image of the salvation which is well calculated for men. For those who have not committed like sins with those who are punished, will never receive a like punishment\" (ibid., 8). \n \n Tertullian\n \"[A]ll other frenzies of the lusts which exceed the laws of nature, and are impious toward both [human] bodies and the sexes, we banish, not only from the threshold but also from all shelter of the Church, for they are not sins so much as monstrosities\" (Modesty 4 [A.D. 220]). \n \n Novatian\n \"[God forbade the Jews to eat certain foods for symbolic reasons:] For that in fishes the roughness of scales is regarded as constituting their cleanness; rough, and rugged, and unpolished, and substantial, and grave manners are approved in men; while those that are without scales are unclean, because trifling, and fickle, and faithless, and effeminate manners are disapproved. Moreover, what does the law mean when it . . . forbids the swine to be taken for food? It assuredly reproves a life filthy and dirty, and delighting in the garbage of vice. . . . Or when it forbids the hare? It rebukes men deformed into women\" (The Jewish Foods 3 [A.D. 250]). \n \n Cyprian of Carthage\n \"[T]urn your looks to the abominations, not less to be deplored, of another kind of spectacle. . . . Men are emasculated, and all the pride and vigor of their sex is effeminated in the disgrace of their enervated body; and he is more pleasing there who has most completely broken down the man into the woman. He grows into praise by virtue of his crime; and the more he is degraded, the more skillful he is considered to be. Such a one is looked upon&#8212;oh shame!&#8212;and looked upon with pleasure. . . . Nor is there wanting authority for the enticing abomination . . . that Jupiter of theirs [is] not more supreme in dominion than in vice, inflamed with earthly love in the midst of his own thunders . . . now breaking forth by the help of birds to violate the purity of boys. And now put the question: Can he who looks upon such things be healthy-minded or modest? Men imitate the gods whom they adore, and to such miserable beings their crimes become their religion\" (Letters 1:8 [A.D. 253]). \n \n \"Oh, if placed on that lofty watchtower, you could gaze into the secret places&#8212;if you could open the closed doors of sleeping chambers and recall their dark recesses to the perception of sight&#8212;you would behold things done by immodest persons which no chaste eye could look upon; you would see what even to see is a crime; you would see what people embruted with the madness of vice deny that they have done, and yet hasten to do&#8212;men with frenzied lusts rushing upon men, doing things which afford no gratification even to those who do them\" (ibid., 1:9). \n \n Arnobius\n \"[T]he mother of the gods loved [the boy Attis] exceedingly, because he was of most surpassing beauty; and Acdestis [the son of Jupiter] who was his companion, as he grew up fondling him, and bound to him by wicked compliance with his lust. . . . Afterwards, under the influence of wine, he [Attis] admits that he is . . . loved by Acdestis. . . . Then Midas, king of Pessinus, wishing to withdraw the youth from so disgraceful an intimacy, resolves to give him his own daughter in marriage. . . . Acdestis, bursting with rage because of the boy&#8217;s being torn from himself and brought to seek a wife, fills all the guests with frenzied madness; the Phrygians shriek, panic-stricken at the appearance of the gods. . . . [Attis] too, now filled with furious passion, raving frantically and tossed about, throws himself down at last, and under a pine tree mutilates himself, saying, &#8216;Take these, Acdestis, for which you have stirred up so great and terribly perilous commotions&#8217;\" (Against the Pagans 5:6&#8211;7 [A.D. 305]). \n \n Eusebius of Caesarea\n \"[H]aving forbidden all unlawful marriage, and all unseemly practice, and the union of women with women and men with men, he [God] adds: &#8216;Do not defile yourselves with any of these things; for in all these things the nations were defiled, which I will drive out before you. And the land was polluted, and I have recompensed [their] iniquity upon it, and the land is grieved with them that dwell upon it&#8217; [Lev. 18:24&#8211;25]\" (Proof of the Gospel 4:10 [A.D. 319]). \n \n Basil the Great\n \"He who is guilty of unseemliness with males will be under discipline for the same time as adulterers\" (Letters 217:62 [A.D. 367]). \n \n \"If you [O, monk] are young in either body or mind, shun the companionship of other young men and avoid them as you would a flame. For through them the enemy has kindled the desires of many and then handed them over to eternal fire, hurling them into the vile pit of the five cities under the pretense of spiritual love. . . . At meals take a seat far from other young men. In lying down to sleep let not their clothes be near yours, but rather have an old man between you. When a young man converses with you, or sings psalms facing you, answer him with eyes cast down, lest perhaps by gazing at his face you receive a seed of desire sown by the enemy and reap sheaves of corruption and ruin. Whether in the house or in a place where there is no one to see your actions, be not found in his company under the pretense either of studying the divine oracles or of any other business whatsoever, however necessary\" (The Renunciation of the World [A.D. 373]). \n \n John Chrysostom\n \"[The pagans] were addicted to the love of boys, and one of their wise men made a law that pederasty . . . should not be allowed to slaves, as if it was an honorable thing; and they had houses for this purpose, in which it was openly practiced. And if all that was done among them was related, it would be seen that they openly outraged nature, and there was none to restrain them. . . . As for their passion for boys, whom they called their paedica, it is not fit to be named\" (Homilies on Titus 5 [A.D. 390]). \n \n \"[Certain men in church] come in gazing about at the beauty of women; others curious about the blooming youth of boys. After this, do you not marvel that [lightning] bolts are not launched [from heaven], and all these things are not plucked up from their foundations? For worthy both of thunderbolts and hell are the things that are done; but God, who is long-suffering, and of great mercy, forbears awhile his wrath, calling you to repentance and amendment\" (Homilies on Matthew 3:3 [A.D. 391]). \n \n \"All of these affections [in Rom. 1:26&#8211;27] . . . were vile, but chiefly the mad lust after males; for the soul is more the sufferer in sins, and more dishonored than the body in diseases\" (Homilies on Romans 4 [A.D. 391]). \n \n \"[The men] have done an insult to nature itself. And a yet more disgraceful thing than these is it, when even the women seek after these intercourses, who ought to have more shame than men\" (ibid.). \n \n \"And sundry other books of the philosophers one may see full of this disease. But we do not therefore say that the thing was made lawful, but that they who received this law were pitiable, and objects for many tears. For these are treated in the same way as women that play the whore. Or rather their plight is more miserable. For in the case of the one the intercourse, even if lawless, is yet according to nature; but this is contrary both to law and nature. For even if there were no hell, and no punishment had been threatened, this would be worse than any punishment\" (ibid.). \n \n Augustine\n \"[T]hose shameful acts against nature, such as were committed in Sodom, ought everywhere and always to be detested and punished. If all nations were to do such things, they would be held guilty of the same crime by the law of God, which has not made men so that they should use one another in this way\" (Confessions 3:8:15 [A.D. 400]). \n \n The Apostolic Constitutions\n \"[Christians] abhor all unlawful mixtures, and that which is practiced by some contrary to nature, as wicked and impious\" (Apostolic Constitutions 6:11 [A.D. 400]).\n \n List found at\n http://www.catholic.com/library/Early_Teachings_on_Homosexuality.asp",
