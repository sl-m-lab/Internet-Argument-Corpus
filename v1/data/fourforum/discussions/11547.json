It says nothing of the consequences of their actions, merely protesting at the facty that the actions were taken. Thaty doesn't affect the justifiability of the law.\n \n EDIT: For extra hilarity... in the other thread where yes was misunderstood, Ethmi even missed out the entire section where all was made clear and still went on the attack.
