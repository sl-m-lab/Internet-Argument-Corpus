   "Actually God made Adam THEN Eve, and Eve was out of Adam (specifically his rib). Thus, women is a mere part of man, and if women is merely a subset of man, then why is it any more unethical for man to have sexual relations with one part of himself than another?\n \n Moving on, God doesn't provide a clear universal condemnation of sodomy at all. The problem is in the context, the area in which sodomy is supposedly condemned is smack in the middle of a bunch of references on what you cannot do as part of religious services, IE, these are not ways to worship God. Thus, many scholars argue that the passage was meant to differentiate pagan worship practices, which might have included sodomy, and jewish practices which shouldn't. Whether it was intended to be extended to general conduct is an open question.\n \n Finally, in terms of government, a distinction must be made between policy and religion. Even if sodomy will cause someone to go to hell, the government isn't supposed to be a super-cop of all things religious. I would contend that going to hell or heaven is a personal choice, admittedly a one sided one, but still a choice. There is no warrent to say that the government can mandate personal choices between two consenting adults for \"their own good.\" Let the people decide how live their lives, not the government. Isn't ironic how conservatives hate governmental intervention into personal affairs unless it is to mandate popular morality? Beautiful.",

If they should be notified, maybe their should be a list sent home to the parents and their sexual oreintation. Maybe if their is a list of the teachers their should be a list of the kids who are gay / lesbian. (Although their are more gay adults than gay teens, as far as I know).

This also seems what you (ROCC) seems to be saying.\n Religion and Politics are something that teaches do not bring up in classrooms because of that very reason. If there were to be a notification about the teachers oreintation should other aspects of the teacher also be included? Maybe a parent doesn't want their child being influenced by a conservative, or a Muslim. \n Their is no reason to do this. The issue is not addressed, although it may be somehow \"leaked\" and known among the students, this \"leak\" could consist of, politcal veiws, religion, and sexual oreintation.\n I also don't think its very often that teachers are going to discuss these things with their students. So their is a very little chance that this will ever influence them.\n This also has nothing to do with that persons teaching ability. \n \n This may seem a little jumbled, although I think you can gather my point is valid. \n \n Thanks for reading this\n \n Always Stay Open Minded",

I say necessarily and totally because a teacher could supporting liberalism, voting for Bush, being a Muslim, and a guy having feelings for another guy are all majorly different things. \n \n \nMaybe their parents don't want them \"hanging out\" with African Americans.\n\n \n A lot of parents don't let their kids hang out with blacks. I'm even suspicious that my ex-girlfriend's mother is a little racist towards black males. It's not right, but there aren't laws being passed to ban racism and racist remarks. \n \n \nIts just another form of racism, sexism, etc...\n\n \n Racism and sexism will always exist, there's nothing you can do to change that. But how is not wanting your child to be influenced by homosexuals a form of homophobia? \n \n \n- Once again, I am speaking of a public school system.\n\n \n I know that, that's why I stated \"You believe that the parents should have no control whatsoever over what the child believes or what the child is taught, and that the government should be responsible for brainwashing the child.\"\n \n \nParents can't be especially picky with these things. Do you also have the right to make sure that teacher is, a white christian conservative, with brown hair who voted for Bush?\n\n \n Actually, they can. You don't have to put your child into a public school where drugs, violence, and sin abound and some teachers are just as screwed up as the kids. \n \n \nMaybe you don't want a jew influencing him with jewish life style... \n\n \n And if you don't, what's wrong with that?\n \n \nIf you don't want your kid being taught by a homosexual, pull him out of that school and send him to a private christian school, where they read the bible so they can brainwash him.... \n\n \n Exactly. If it's the parent or legal guardian pulling the kid out of public school and wanting the kid to learn about Jesus and the Bible, there is absolutely NOTHING wrong with that. A parent can brainwash their child into despising Christians (like a lot of the people of these forums) but I wouldn't give a XXXX, but if the government gathers a bunch of children together to brainwash them into despising Christians, that's where the line is drawn. No matter what you want to believe, the government is not responsible for brainwashing kids today. Brainwashing goes on all the time, and if it's to be done by someone, let's not let it be big brother who only wants more political control over our lives.\n \n \nI'm going to try to remain calm...\n\n \n Good for you...!!! \n \n \nI beleive that the parent should not try to influence their childrens beleifs. Its their journey, don't brainwash them from a child so they won't go to hell or someother ridiculous christian XXXX.\n\n \n The parents were responsible for the birth of the child. They can influence any idea or belief the child might have. It's not up to the government, anti-Christian groups, and/or liberals to do that. \n \n On the 'journey of life', you're always going to be brainwashed by someone or something. There's no avoiding it. Better to go to Heaven than Hell, is it not? \n \n \n- I don't understand what your saying whatsoever.\n\n \n Here's a little help. You don't want Christian parents to influence their kids to become Christians. You would rather them go to public schools to socialize and be influenced by the secular system to become adamant atheists. Correct?\n \n \n- I'm 14 and at this point, if I had a kid I would not care the teachers: sexual prefrence, religion, politcal veiws, color, or who they voted for, or w/e little petty diffrences you can think of that does not effect their teaching ability.\n\n \n Wow, we have something in common. \n \n Anyway, let's create a little scenario. There are two teachers. One is a homosexual, a humanist, a liberal, white, and votes for the candidate who hates Christianity and it's morals and principles. The other is heterosexual, a Christian, a liberalistic-conservative (my own little word and my stance) and votes for the candidate who embraces Chrisitianity and it's morals and principles. \n \n Which one would you choose? Which one would I choose? Oh yeah, they both have the same level of teaching ability.",

(Unless its something that violates the rights of others). When it comes to civil disputable ideas such as being gay its completely up to the person as it should be.\n The parent can say that there is something wrong with this, and thats completely ok, but that shouldn't mean that the teacher should be denied a job position as a teacher.\n \n \n \"People are discriminated against all the time based on race, color, looks, wealth, and anything else you can think of.

It was a 2 day inclusion in our health class, and little was discussed other than how to use a condom, and a brief anatomy and physiology lesson. Sad. There is so much more children should be taught about sex. We had very little discussion about STD's, pregnancy, and the benefits and consequences of sex. Subjects such as oral sex and anal sex were never mentioned. I think that considering that there can be significant risks associated with these (many people feel that you cannot get an STD from oral sex, and anal sex can lead to hepatitis and other diseases far more easily than any other type of sex), they should be discussed. However, since these are practiced by heterosexual as well as homosexual couples, it does not need to be a homosexual only discussion. \n \n I think that a great majority of heterosexual education comes from the unavoidable indoctrination experienced from birth on up. It is the base feature of society, the idea that sex = man + woman. I don't really remember being taught this in school however, other than perhaps the study of Romeo and Juliet. I was lucky in the fact that our library even contained some books with homosexual themes, some of which were actually interesting reads. I also never witnessed any anti-gay sentiment in my school, despite a relatively small but open population of gay students and teachers. I just don't see that the benefits of homosexuality nor heterosexuality should be taught in a school. Of course, a child should never be ignored if they have a question about something. If the teacher feels that it is a discussion not appropriate for the classroom, it would be prudent to advise the student to ask the question later. You say that being gay is great, others say that being straight is great. I say knowing true love, regardless of the sex of your partner, is great.",

   "Other than knowing what homosexuality is, I don't really see a need for children to be \"educated\" on the subject.(...) However, since these are practiced by heterosexual as well as homosexual couples, it does not need to be a homosexual only discussion.\n\n \n I think you misunderstood me. I don't think there should be a course on homosexuality or anything. I do think that as homosexuals exist in the world (and queerness is not a bad thing), kids who are exposed to people like this, families like this, stories about this, etc., will benefit from it. You don't necessarily have to sit kids down and \"have a talk\" about it or randomly insert it into the curriculum. Talking about families, sex, households, love, parents, adults, whatever, inevitably begs mention of all kinds of different communities. The more communities children are introduced to when young, the better their understanding of the world will be.\n \n I also strongly disagree with the notion that children should be sheilded from \"unpleasantness\", like death or controversy. Children can grasp a lot more then they are generally given credit for, and if they are not told anything they will come to their own conclusions about things- which is often not a good thing. \n \n Keeping children imprisoned in a fake saccharine world of \"happy\" Christian heterosexual married rich suburbian WASPs is borderline abusive, and will only stunt their emotional and intellectual growth. They might end up spending their adult lives as bitter ranting homophobes.",
