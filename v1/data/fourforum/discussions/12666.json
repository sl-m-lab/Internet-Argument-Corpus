   "One of the regular features of a British Government is that every so often the Prime Minister shuffles his Government i.e. moves Ministers around to other jobs, demotes/promotes/sacks as appropriate.\n \n One paper has indicated that the incompetent ministers will be got rid off. That then will be a first as not one minister from the Prime Minister down can be classified as even marginally competent. Wonder how a PM reshuffles himself!!",
