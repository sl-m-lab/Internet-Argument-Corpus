   "Personally I would use the population to create machines on the threshold of being sentinet, and then I would make the population turn my brain into a kind of CPU, I would still be me, but be immortal and in control of a machine army of superintellegent robots. I would then order several million robots who are sentient to be made and placed at the core of a massive computer, not networked to the un-sentient machine armies who I soully are in contanct with. Each robot would get his own computer in which he could do thinking for me.The thinking robots would only be able to contact one another through a single fibre-optic cable, and if any of the million or so thinking robots tryed to take my power away the fibre optic capble connecting the robots to each other would be cut, and the offending robots destroyed. All ideas made by the networked serious of computers is put into a buffer to make sure the computers don't try anything freaking with my brain, and the idea extracted and sent to one of my un-sentient robots who read it so that I could get the just of it. \n \n After my armies became capable of repairing themselves I would massacre the remaining humans and then begin my assualt on the stars, with several million robots 50 times smarter then any human genius by technology would be unparrelled to others, I would be unstoppable. Of course reblion could happen, in that case I could cut all the fibre optic cables of the sentient computers, and if that failed I would detonate nuclear bombs I have planted in each of my earth bound robots. If that failed I would detonate nukes I have hidden, they would destroy the face of the earth and kill all robots. But if that failed I would use my orbiting platforms to blast away the robot ranks, and the only person controling the platforms is me, connected through AM, FM, Infared, UV, X-ray and several other signals specifically talored so that no robot could ever take command of the orbiting platforms, because without the right serious of pulses of the ElectroMagnet spectrum the orbiting platforms wouldn't listen to commands. And even if they did, I would have nukes attached to each one of the orbiting platforms. To prevent the need to nuke myself, all robots in by base would be connected to be through my brain-computer via direct link to my brain-computer. The thinking computers would be destroyed and 4 robots connected to me via cables would then start rebuilding my empire. Of course in the even of my alien enemies trying to attack, or of my robot ships also trying to kill me, I would have unmanned or unroboted defense platforms orbiting all planets, and one orbiting the sun, where after suffeicent time spent on technology, I would relocate, and become impervious to attack. \n \n My forces would capture the galaxy, unstoppable because for every time the enemy sleeps, me and my computers will be thinking, planning, inventing. \n Slowly other galaxies would be conquered, and resoruces found. And after enough time I would create a sphere around a super-massive blackhole, so I would us its energy. Around that black hole I would place hundreds of thosuands of stars covered completely in weapons, and the weapons would draw energy directly from the suns themselves. My robots and I would eventually conquer the universe, but we could always keep a few steps from killing the enemy, just for fun. My machines would break the thermo-dynamic wall, and invent machines that could create matter out of nothing. We would fill the universe with trillions of trillions of trillions of robots connected to me through various ways.\n \n After the universe was mine, I would expand to other universes, and slowly I would conquer all universes. I would Invent a sheild for my own universe so only my own forces could enter, and enemy forces who did enter, or would deal with as many robots as 40 billion years can make. because their would be infinite parrell universes we could be busy forever, always securing more terriotry. When my empire has at the number of 100 universes and 1000 trillion robots being produced each second I would make my robots construct a human body that would not age (where I coudl live), and then create two other humans, named Adam and Eve, and then watch as they repopulated the earth, which I never had to nuke. My forces using the infinite power of perfectly balanced atoms would wait until the people of earth were advanced enough to begin exploring the stars, all the while my emipre conquering new universes. Finally when the people of earth discovered my ships outside their world, I would destroy thier world down to just two people, I would then repair any damage I had down, and restock the oceans and land with whatever the precvious people had taken, then I would start agian. Each timing picking out the Einstiens and the Hawkings and turning them into my thinking-idea creating slaves. Of course this would happen the universes over but I would always keep the people of earth a little longer each time. \n \n To prevent the other parrelel universes like mine from attacking and conquering me I would invent something that locked off my universe on the quantum level, something impervious and something even I couldn't change. \n I would still be able to send orders through the universail divides, and would continue my conquest. If I had played by cards right, I would be busy for forever, always keeping one universe in my back pocket just in case I needed a luanching point. Of course somehow the enemy could kill all my universes, in which case I would start another quantum bubble and start a new universe inside mine just enough to let me pass through the wall, which I would then send in a single ship of mine, and the lock off the other universe. Universes that can break the qauntum universe wall will only be located inside the unviserse that is sealed off, all others made from the outside would not work!!!!!!!!! the newly made universe would be my staging point for another several billion years until I could launch another attack on everything, and I would.",

   "First off, I would be addressed as either \"Your Lordship\", or \"Jimmy\"...I would have to decide once I got the job. Just always liked the nickname Jimmy.\n \n Anyway:\n \n Rap music / R&B / pop music (like Wacko, Brittney, Timberfake etc...) banned. Playing of such music will get you sent to the Island of Cuba, where you will remain in exile. All of the \"artists\" I deem unfit for society also go to Cuba, they can party all they want down there, as long as I can't hear it in Key West.\n \n Free health care for those who need it. Anyone found abusing the system will be given a \"final injection...the ultimate high\".\n \n All jobs will be given on the basis of competence for the position (other than mine), not on race, sex, or who you know / &low.\n \n Education to be provided for free. Teachers, profs, etc. payed by my government.\n \n Criminals are dealt with harshly. Felony offenses: 1 with a 10 year sentence, sencond offense automatically gets you a death sentence in the texas electric chair. Misdemeanor offenses: 1 gets you a warning, 2 gets you 1 year in jail, 3 gets you a felony record, 4 gets you second felony arrest. So at most, a rap sheet might consist of 4 crimes. \n \n Decriminalize drug use and ownership, so long as the users do not hurt anyone other than themselves. Hurting others, regardless of scale, would result in a felony.\n \n 1 criminal offense automatically causes the loss of your right to own a gun. Also, anyone deemed mentally unstable or mentally ill is denied access to drugs, guns, alcohol.\n \n All cell phones get rid of those annoying damn ring tones. Every cell phone rings like a phone used to...does anyone remember that sound?\n \n Professional athletes can make no more than 100K a year. \n \n So called \"reality\" programming banned from TV. TV would consist of:\n 1. Fair and impartial news source not controlled or censored by the govt. \n 2. The all Flintstones channel (everything i needed to know about life i learned from fred)\n 3. any other programming would be strictly pay per view at a price of $1.00/hr.\n 4. MTV, QVC and like channels, Lifetime, BET, and any strictly religious channels banned.\n \n A world truely free from religious bias, everyone is free to believe whatever they want. Attempting to influence others religious views punishable by death. \n \n Rapture not allowed to post on the internet.\n \n Weapons of mass destruction sought out and destroyed, including the vast stockpiles owned by the US, Brittain, Australia, France, Germany, Japan, China, and Russia. \n \n Canada annexed as the 51st state.\n \n All the freestate / libertarian / gun-fanatic / militia joining XXXXXX sent to Cuba to join the rap enthusiests...they should get along famously.\n \n George Carlin made senior policy advisor.\n \n No more brail on drive up ATM's...this frightens me.\n \n Water would not cost more than gas.\n \n Condoms / birth control pills free, abortion costly.\n \n Anyone who refuses to usefully contribute to society automatically sent to Cuba (i like to keep all the misfits together).\n \n Bob Barker, Dick Clark, and Emanuel Lewis automatically cut in half so we can count the rings and determine age.",

   "The first thing I would do is simplify the world by creating super countries. The US, Canada, and Israel would become one country, Mexico and the rest of Central America would become one country, All of South American minus Brazil would become one country, Western Europe would become one country, Eastern Europe, Russia, North Korea, and China would become one country, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and Australia would become one country, India and Pakistan would again become one country, the arab nations would all become one country and the whole of Africa would become one country. Democracy and the free market would be the only option for ruling each of these new super countries. After an adjusting period of a few years I would suspect that Africa would become much more stable and the arab nation would become wary of attacking Israel for fear of retaliation from the US against the whole of their country.
