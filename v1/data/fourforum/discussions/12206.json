The fact is child, it's you who's alone in your claim and denial of history. Here's my previous post from the other thread.\n \n \n Blah, blah, blah... swallow some evidence and choke on your lies and bogus interpretation ot actual real world history.\n The Collapse of Communism\n Editor: Lee Edwards \n ISBN: 978-0-8179-9812-7 \n Pub Date: November 10, 1999 \n Product Format: Paper \n Availability: In stock. \n Price: $18.95\n Qty: \n Ten years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and eight years after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, experts continue to debate one of the most important political questions of the twentieth century-why did Communism collapse so suddenly? A comprehensive and often unexpected answer is provided in this unique volume of essays by the world's leading authorities on Communism.\n \n Presidential adviser Zbignew Brzezinski discusses the critical role of policymakers like Ronald Reagan, Mikhail Gorbachev, and John Paul II in the demise of Communism. Richard Pipes and Martin Malia debate the importance of history and ideology. Robert Conquest analyzes the deleterious impact of the Stalin years, and Michael Novak delineates the missing element of faith in Communism. Andrzej Brzeski exposes the fatal flaws of Communist economics; Brian Crozier discusses why there was a cold war. Paul Hollander concludes with a consideration of who in the academy was right-and wrong-about Communism. These insightful essays suggest that a wide range of forces-political, economic, strategic, and religious-along with the indispensable role of the principled statesman and the brave dissident, brought about the collapse of Communism.The Collapse of Communism\n I \n INTRODUCTION\n Printer-friendly version of section\n Collapse of Communism, the disintegration of Communist regimes in Eastern Europe and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) between 1989 and 1991.\n \n II \n CAUSES OF THE COLLAPSE OF COMMUNISM\n Printer-friendly version of section\n The basic causes were economic stagnation, the rise of nationalist resistance to the ideology of communism, attempts to increase democracy, and changes in the international political environment. These factors were all interlinked and the Soviet leadership failed to devise a sequence of reforms that would enable it to sustain its rule.\n \n By the 1980s the Communist regimes were all coming close to economic stagnation, in part caused by enormous defence expenditures. The \"Star Wars\" initiative proposed by the United States president Ronald Reagan in 1983 threatened to provoke an arms race that would impose even greater burdens on people who had experienced improvements in their standard of living and wanted more.\n \n There had been earlier attempts in Eastern Europe at reforming the Communist system from within (1956 in Hungary (see Hungarian Revolution) and 1968 in Czechoslovakia (see Prague Spring), but these had been repressed by Soviet leaders who feared losing the buffer zone between the Soviet Union and the West that had been established after World War II. What had changed by the mid-1980s was the emergence in 1985 of Mikhail Gorbachev, representing a new political generation, as general-secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU).Communism, Collapse of - MSN Encarta\n Former Communist Countries\n \n Albania\n Bulgaria\n Czechoslovakia\n East Germany\n Hungary\n Mongolia\n Poland\n Romania\n U.S.S.R\n Yugoslavia\n \n And all of the USSR's satellite countries are also listed.\n Former Communist Countries\n \n Museum of Communism\"Never again.\" The tyranny and atrocities of Nazi Germany have been justly condemned by world opinion for over 50 years. But it is only recently that Communist despotism has begun to receive remotely similar attention.\n It would be a great tragedy if Communism disappeared from the earth without leaving behind an indelible memory of its horrors. Communism was not essentially about espionage, or power politics, or irreligion. Rather it was a grand theoretical synthesis of totalitarianism... a theory which millions of people experienced as the practice of murder and slavery.\n \n The roots of Communism lie squarely in the works of the philosopher Karl Marx. But at the same time, as we shall see, the tradition of Czarist absolutism also became an important source of Communist inspiration. The first exhibit to open explores the Marxist and Czarist origins of the Communist movement.Museum of Communism\n \n Chew on these and if you need more of an education I'll supply it to you. In other words, spew your garbage to the world at large and stop preaching your historical lies to me.\n http://www.4forums.com/political/creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution/12047-theory-evolutions-failed-prediction-coelacanth-3.html#post339755",

This was addressed in the first page. \n \n \nNo, the western world was involved in deliberate propaganda to make sure that failing totalitarian states were seen as communist, and any that actually tried to be communist were made to fail (particularly in south america). The ruling classes in the west have long had a goal of making socialism in general and communism in particular appear to be unworkable and even dangerous.

Marx specifically stated that Communist countries would not engage in trade with the free world. The countries you call Communist did just that. The USSR exported significant amounts of marine products, particularly caviar to the world and in turn traded for large amounts of US grain. And the USSR specifically practiced capitalism in its military and science cities to motivate innovation.
