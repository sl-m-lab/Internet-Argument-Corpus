   "I think that listening to AA, Marc etc gives people a weird and warped image of Christianity. After all, it is NOT about evidence, it is about Faith. \n \n The moment we insist that we have \"evidence\" for God, or that God can be proven through events and things, then instead we see a God-of-the-gaps idea, a phenomenon so limiting of God that it blasphemously shrinking God to a primitive \"Gee, I don't understand, so it must be the gods\" idea. THAT is the lame and pathetic god that creationists promote, the god of physical observance. After all, Faith, the cornerstone of Christianity is completely disregarded by this crowd of creationists and other weak-faithed individuals.\n \n They are exactly like the Israelites in the desert, asking of a golden calf to physically evidencing God, their god (little g) is just their unimaginative impression of God (capital G). Creationists are desperately and panically seeking for their golden calf, and desperately speak against anybody who seek to have them look at their Faith instead.\n \n That really is what we are witnessing in these forum, a bunch of pathetic and weak-Faithed individuals pleading for something to build their faith (little f) on. And pathetic, weak-minded individuals clinging desperately to their warped and blasphemic God-of-the-gaps will say anything because they are driven by fear of losing their \"afterlife.\" It doesn't matter what lies they have to tell us, because their concerns are solely directed at not going to their mythological version of hell (again seen by themselves as a physical location like everything else about God).\n \n And when such people of weak faith are afraid of Hell, telling falsehoods, spewing self-deluded ideas because all their worries are focused on somehow wanting to have a physical life after death, they of course show no concerns at all about bearing false witness and whatever else the faith in God (capital G) requires us to avoid.\n \n And they know it, they know that their grip on the elusive, self-deluded afterlife is slipping, so they get more desperate.\n \n Like people in a burning building who only see the door in the distance and will trample babies and their own mother to get through that door first.\n \n Now, does ANYBODY here think that such self-deluded, panicked creationists ever will show any concern to honesty and truth rather than whatever sophistry they believe will get them first in line?\n\n i have much respect for your position because this was also my belief when i was a christian. i started posting on a few discussion boards a few years ago, armed and ready to dismantle the folly of evolution. i almost immediately realized that what i thought was evolution, and therefore what i was arguing against, was based on a false view of what evolutin really was\n \n humbled, i backed off the attacking and started to observe. i realized that there were quite a number of posters like marc and jyoshu, who believe in the bible as the word of God, but who also subscribe to facts, evidence and science to support their belief. many of them end up in the logically irreconcilable position of \"creation-scientist\". how someone can believe the bible is true, yet simultaneously discredit genesis to an allegory is beyond me. furthermore, any attempts to extract a moral from taking genesis as an allegory, or some sort of meaning that this allegory is based on, always turns up void\n \n i would caution you. if you open-mindedly participate in a forum like this, you will eventually lose your Faith. there is something about truth that find those that seek it. most people's goals on forums like these doesnt include educating themselves. if you are one of those people, then you have nothing to worry about. but if you are like me, and you seek truth, then be prepared for change. i'm writing in a cautionary tone not because i dont want you to find truth, but because change is usually uncomfortable....",

As a Christian, I agree with you. Mainstream Christian organizations such as Answers In Genesis agree with you. Militant atheists like Richard Dawkins agree with you. Another atheist, Francis Crick, puts it this way;\n \n \nA knowledge of the true age of the earth and of the fossil record makes it impossible for any balanced intellect to believe in the literal truth of every part of the Bible in the way that fundamentalists do.

I would dearly love to see some civilized debate on this subject, not to participate myself, but to read and learn. That is \"can Genesis be discredited to an allegory, to an acceptable medium between evolution and Christianity?\" Or, is evolution atheistic?

In their mission statement, AIG puts it this way;\n \n \nThe scientific aspects of creation are important, but are secondary in importance to the proclamation of the gospel of Jesus Christ. \n\n \n http://www.answersingenesis.org/about/faith\n \n From another AIG page (Ken Hamm)\n \n \nI want to make it VERY clear that we don't want to be known primarily as 'young-Earth creationists.' AiG's main thrust is NOT 'young Earth' as such; our emphasis is on Biblical authority. \n\n \n The Gospel of Jesus Christ and Biblical authority are essential tenets of AIG. Now for the denominations you referenced;\n \n Lutherans; \nTo borrow a phrase from Luther, the Bible is \"the manger in which the Word of God is laid.\" While Lutherans recognize differences in the way the Bible should be studied and interpreted, it is accepted as the primary and authoritative witness to the church's faith. Written and transcribed by many authors over a period of many centuries, the Bible bears remarkable testimony to the mighty acts of God in the lives of people and nations. \n\n \n http://www.elca.org/communication/brief.html#thebible\n \n The gospel of Jesus Christ and Biblical authority are essential tenets of Lutherans. (I'm a Lutheran.) \n \n Methodists; \nAll Christians must take seriously our responsibility to \"learn the ABCs\"\n - learn \"About the Bible in Church.\" Unless we read it, study it, learn\n what's in it and feel comfortable with it in our hands and on our\n tongues, we cannot truly love the Word of God. Instead, we're intimidated\n by it, afraid of it, shocked by it or simply remain ignorant of it.\n Let us all be renewed in a faith that has been enriched by the gift of\n Scripture so we may end our worship by saying: \"We were well-pleased\n to impart to you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives\" (1\n Thessalonians 2:8, NASB). \n\n \n http://www.auburnumc.org/novemberlink.pdf\n \n The gospel of Jesus Christ and Biblical authority are essential tenets of Methodists. \n \n \n Catholic; \n\"The responsibility of our Apostolic office impels us to...promote the study of Holy \n Scripture in accordance with the teaching of our predecessors, Leo XIII and Pius X... \n We shall...never desist from urging the faithful to read daily the Gospels, the Acts and \n the Epistles, so as to gather thence food for their souls...Ignorance of the Bible means \n ignorance of Christ.\" \n\n \n http://www.wideopenwest.com/~egoward/TheCatholicBible.html\n \n The gospel of Jesus Christ and Biblical authority are essential tenets of Catholicism. \n \n \n Anglicanism; \nScripture, the Bible, is a foundation of Anglican churches. \n\n \n http://anglicansonline.org/basics/bible.html\n \n So the Gospel of Jesus Christ and Biblical authority are essential tenets of Anglicanism. \n \n \n Presbyterians; \nWe believe the Bible is the written word of God, inspired by the Holy Spirit and without error in the original manuscripts. The Bible is the revelation of God's truth and is infallible and authoritative in all matters of faith and practice. \n\n \n http://www.pcanet.org/general/beliefs.htm\n \n So the gospel of Jesus Christ and Biblical authority are essential tenets of Presbyterianism. \n \n \n \nWhile there are differences between the denominations, most of the basic doctrines agreed upon by the early catholic church are still accepted by all. For example, Roman Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, most Protestants, and most charismatic groups believe in the Trinity and in the Deity of Christ -- established by the church councils of Nicaea and Chalcedon. All orthodox Christian denominations agree that Jesus Christ, the God-man, died to atone for the sins of the world, and was raised from the grave to break the power of Satan and death. \n\n \n http://www.rbc.org/questionsDetail.aspx?id=45948\n \n The Trinity and Deity of Christ, just like AIG. \n \n \n \nHistorically, not even Baptist theology had anything in common with AIG theology. \n\n \n I've personally seen Ken Hamm of AIG speak at a local Baptist church on two different occasions. \n \n \n \nIt's just another example of the evolution of christian truth. The cult expressed by AIG is less than 20 years old and depends on previous ideas from 7th day Adventists.\n \n Haven't you even bothered to learn the history of the ideas that you spout?\n\n \n Do you just dream this stuff up out of thin air, or are there atheist propaganda sources that supply you?",

Christianity presupposes that the Bible is infallible, and that anything man does is fallible. Atheism presupposes that Darwinism is infallible, and that the Bible, or anything else man does, is fallible. That's the big disadvantage that Christians have in the debate with evolution. Christians have to be honest in their commitment to the Bible, yet evolutionists don't have to be honest in their commitment to Darwinism. They can claim that if something else comes along that scientifically proves Darwinism wrong, and shows a better alternative to it, that they'll abandon Darwinism like the plague, and enthusiastically support the new alternative. Darwinism is simply too politically entrenched to abandon, and we have at least one example, possibly more, that any alternative to Darwinism will NEVER see the light of day. \n \n \nSurely the lesson there is that if you're going to proclaim yourself the bearer of the unadulterated word of god, you'd better be damn sure you can read his handwriting first.\n\n \n And if I'm in full agreement with those handwriting analysts who believe he doesn't exist, I'm not going to be very sure I'm reading it right!! emoticon_idea \n \n And don't call me Surely. emoticon_xclown",

All science is trying to do is figure out how it happened. Darwin helped. \n\n \n Science is trying to figure out how it happened, without God. Many scientific topics of today; stem cell research, cloning, bioethics, ID attacks, show more than an innocent desire for figuring out how things happened. Most of those who are interested in those highly political topics are trying to shield themselves from scrutiny by attacking religion. Those of us who aren't wedded to science don't have a hard time seeing it. \n \n \nI suspect that you have no clear idea what you even mean when you talk about science being 'funneled into Darwinism'. I think you're observing the end result - that no facts have ever emerged to support biblical creation - and simply assuming that must be because nobody is looking for them. \n\n \n I get an idea from some threads that are started here, and the links that they contain. When it looks like explorations are specifically set up to find certain things, it's not hard to imagine that explorations that could find undesirable things could be avoided, especially considering the emotions that are stirred up in the scientific community by the concept of Intelligent Design. \n \n \nLet's be perfectly clear about this: if the natural world unambiguously bore the hallmarks of having been created a few thousand years ago, all species distinct and unrelated, science would see that and reach the appropriate conclusion. It hasn't reached that conclusion because the facts don't support it. End of story. \n\n \n What you have to keep in mind is that the facts you speak of weren't all discovered only by yourself. Everyone relies on others for the vast majority of information they receive on any complex subject, or at least a subject that has improved and modernized over several generations. It's a good thing of course, it's how we build knowledge in technological advances, etc. But it can carry dangers, if the people we rely on for straight information mix in questionable philosophy. Pope John Paul puts it this way;\n \n \n \nAnother threat to be reckoned with is \"scientism.\" This is the philosophical notion which refuses to admit the validity of forms of knowledge other than those of the positive sciences; and it relegates religious, theological, ethical and aesthetic knowledge to the realm of mere fantasy. In the past, the same idea emerged in positivism and neo-positivism, which considered metaphysical statements to be meaningless. Critical epistemology has discredited such a claim, but now we see it revived in the new guise of scientism, which dismisses values as mere products of the emotions and rejects the notion of being in order to clear the way for pure and simple facticity. Science would thus be poised to dominate all aspects of human life through technological progress. The undeniable triumphs of scientific research and contemporary technology have helped to propagate a scientistic outlook, which now seems boundless, given its inroads into different cultures and the radical changes it has brought. \n\n \n When you claim that facts support Darwinism - end of story - you have no way of analyzing all the methods used by those before you to arrive at those facts. There's no way for anyone to draw a distinct line between true science and scientific philosophy, when it comes to the origins of the world, and of life. \n \n \nSo it's not about Genesis actually being correct, it's Genesis being shown to be wrong that you object to. Appearances are more important than truth. \n\n \n Yes, because it's not factually being shown to be wrong. It's being philosophically shown to be wrong. \n \n \nBut you've just said you don't care whether the bible is the infallible word of God or not. \n\n \n Hmmm - that was very electrolyte-esqe. Where in the world did I say that? \n \n \nI asked you whether abandoning science would make Genesis correct, and you said no.\n\n \n It was a fallacious question, you know that. Either way I answer, I'm saying Genesis is incorrect. Let me put it this way - nothing man does is going to make one bit of difference in how correct Genesis is. \n \n \nEither you've misspoken, or you've managed to pack multiple contradictions into two sentences and blown both your own feet off in the process :) I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and let you rephrase that.\n\n \n I don't see any contradictions, but I'll reword it. Christianity presupposes that the Bible is the only thing that is infallible. Atheists/evolutionists presuppose that Darwinism is the only thing that is infallible. So Darwinism is subject to rejection by Christians, and the Bible is subject to rejection by evolutionists. \n \n \nI totally agree that you are at a disadvantage, having shackled yourself to an immovable object without checking first to see if it would be covered by the tide.

You didn't really read it, did you?\n \n \nAm I as good as Dobzhansky or what?\n\n Dobzhansky was a trained biologist. You aren't.\n \n \nMaybe a good sig for me?\n\n Hey, I won't stop you from putting your dumbass bigotry in your signature. It'll let the newcomers know exactly what they'd be dealing with.\n \n \nDarwinism depends on geology to say certain things.\n\n Like what?\n \n \nDarwinism depends on cosmology to say certain things.\n\n Really? What cosmological facts does Darwinism rely upon?\n \n \nDarwinism depends on astronomy to say certain things.\n\n What astronomical facts does Darwinism rely upon?\n \n \nWhere's the geological evidence for a flood? How did light exist without the sun? Where did the energy for the plants come from if the sun didn't exist yet? I keep asking these questions, yet I never get an answer...\nHow did the first life originate? Why can science never create life from non living chemicals? I keep asking these questions, and never get an answer...\n\n Oh, the irony. I say that I never get an answer, and here's marc \"responding\" with a non-answer. It's your belief, marc, so back it up.\n Why can science never recreate the same exact sequence of hands I got while playing poker tonight? Clearly, my poker buddies and I were all delusional every single hand I had, because the probability of those precise hands being dealt to me were unfathomably astronomical.\n \n \n Why can't I call you a chicken violator because, well, I know that people who go by the name \"marc\" are chicken violators?\nWasn't much I could do - it's difficult for a non degreed person to come up with this type of brilliance.\n\n How kind -- oh, wait, that's not the right word... dishonest... dishonest is the word I'm looking for -- How dishonest of you to rip my quotation completely out of context and use it as if I were actually accusing you of violating chickens. I notice that you didn't include a link to even the thread in question let alone the post. In the post, I made it perfectly clear that I had no evidence that you violated chickens, but that if it was okay for you to continue to scream statements for which there was no evidence, I could do it too. In fact, I explained that I would simply make reference to your alleged, unsubstantiated chickenloving every time you made a claim for which there was no evidence. You ran crying to admin, so I stopped. I'll save this and show him that you've declared open season on marc's unevidenced claims.\n \n \nThen I pointed out how secularism can and is using evolution to imply that religion can be some type of evolutionary quirk of the mind, and you responded with this one that I found very difficult to counter;\nAnd if you're too busy having wonderful sexy fun with those chickens...\n\n\n And anybody who had the reading comprehension ability of a fifth grader would realize that you had just made a claim for which you had no evidence! Hence the reference to your chickenloving. This is really quite simple.\n \n \nMy last desperation attempt to salvage my ridiculous position was to ask if you were committing the fallacy of \"needling\", you know, simply attempting to make your opponent angry. You expertly refuted that one too;\nAnd, just so you're clear, parody is a valid form of counterargument.\n\n\n It is a parody, marc. If you get to claim whatever you want without evidence, then I get to claim whatever I want without evidence. The fact that my claim is ridiculous to everybody on the face of the planet -- especially you -- should show that baseless claims are unreliable. But you just don't get it. But why should you? You don't believe in reasoning...\n \n \nSo after posts 332 & 333, I left the thread and you therefore \"kicked my XXX\". Good job.\n\n Gee, thanks marc. Don't look now, but it's happening again. Will you be running away again soon?\n \n \nDo you have a book called \"how basketball shows that God does not exist\"? If you don't, you may have a difficult time using it as a weapon against another religion.\n\n But basketball players rely upon physics and understanding of projectile motion instead of just pushing the ball in the general direction of the basket and asking God to make it go through the hoop. Clearly, this is a slap in the face of God and a method of worshipping James Naismith.\n But, in the least surprising event ever to occur in the history of the planet, you've completely missed the point. (Okay, so I exaggerate, but not much.) Either an attraction to a topic makes it a religion or it does not. You don't get to pick and choose. If wanting to play basketball doesn't qualify as a religion, then neither does wanting to understand the development of life over time.\n \n \nName me a Christian denomination that has edited the book of Genesis out of its Bible.\n\n Oh, look, more dishonesty. But does anyone here think I'm surprised?\n I never said that any Christian denomination removed the book of Genesis from their Bible. I never even implied such. I merely said that they don't take it literally.\n Can you make any arguments that don't rely upon either blatant lies or deceit, marc? Can you respond to my points without pretending that I've said something that I really have not, or without taking my statements out of context? \n \n \nOr maybe your anger is preventing you from understanding a coherent argument. I said that evolutionists don't have to be HONEST about their commitment to Darwinism. They can BE committed to it, without ADMITTING they are committed to it.\n\n You contradicted yourself, marc. No buts about it. I wasn't the only one to point this out. Pretending that we're talking about something else isn't going to save you.\n Again, you're being dishonest about the topic being discussed. Just how pathetic are you going to make this thread, marc?\n \n \nHmmm - that was very electrolyte-esqe. Where in the world did I say that?\n\n So now you're calling me a liar in a post that isn't even responding to me.\n I've changed my mind, marc. You really should be banned. This is just ridiculous. You can't say a damn thing without it being dishonest, a blatant lie, or a backhanded attack.\n \n trebor makes a good point. It's not a tenet of Christianity to lie. AiG does. Habitually. For money. Under the ruse of promoting Christianity. In case you can't put two and two together (and I'm not convinced you can), AiG is whoring itself out under the guise of being Godly.\n But then, here you are proving you're hardly any better. At least you're not being shamelessly dishonest for money; you apparently just do it for fun.",

   "No matter what Marc thinks, he is wrong about AIG, creationism and mainstream christianity. He typifies the typical, isolated creationist who thinks that his beliefs are true of everyone. Over the years I have had close friends among the clergy, the closest being Lutheran, Methodist, Catholic, and Presbyterian. As a biologist, I discussed the issues of evolution and a literal reading of the Bible with all of them. One even commented that you would have to be stupid not to accept evolution. All of them saw Genesis as allegorical. As was explained to me, anyone who was a member of one of the above religions and who professed young earth creationism is not professing a fundamental tenet of those religions.\n \n However, I can't really say how those religions have changed in the last decades. Certainly we know that creationism is a relatively modern development. Young earth creationism first arose in the early part of the last century among 7th Day Adventists. This dogma was developed by George McCready Price and his flood geology. It turns out that fundamentalist christian cults were easy targets for this particular belief. Early attempts to inject science into fundamentalism, such as the Religion and Science Association (RSA), failed miserably for lack of members. The Deluge Geology Society (DGS) also suffered from a lack of membership, and well as the American Scientific Affiliation (ASA). As time passed, the ASA moved from the strict creationism of Price to progressive creationism and even theistic evolution. This happened as the scientific qualifications of the membership actually increased. It seems that those who hold strict young earth creationist views generally have few qualifications in science. That was true of the RSA, DGS, and the ASA.\n \n However, with the launch of Sputnik, Americans realized that we were seriously lagging in science education. This event prompted a revision and updating of science texts and curricula. The concepts of evolution in biology and the great age of the earth in geology caused the creationist organizations to become more vocal. The focus turned from efforts to support creationism with science, to efforts to disprove science. Organizations such as the Institute for Creation Research (ICR) arose, directly inspired by the flood geology of the 7th Day Adventist George McCready Price, although the ICR would prefer that their link to 7th Day Adventists not be known.\n \n New laws were passed in several states in efforts to force the teaching of biblical creationism as science. All such efforts have failed, the latest being the efforts to inject ID in to the schools of Dover, PA.\n \n At any rate, if the AIG is mainstream christian, then it only shows how much the basic tenets of christianity can change over the years. It seems that truth among christians is a matter of what is popular.",

I don't consider you to be knowledgable in Catholicism.\n \n \n \nYou're entitled to your opinion, no matter how utterly absurd it is.

Any links at all?\n \n \n \nI'm sorry if you never learned how to read, marc, but your and Archie's own links show that the book aims at a deity with the same characteristics of the Judeo-Christian God and specifically says that it doesn't disprove every version of God. \n\n \n And I explained to you that it has a chapter entitled \"Living in the GODLESS universe\". I explained to you before what the suffix \"less\" means, but you missed it. \n \n \n \nArgumentum ad populum, or pointless factoid? \n\n \n Neither one.

Just how pathetic are you going to make this thread, marc? \n\n \n You've already made it quite pathetic. \n \n \nSo now you're calling me a liar in a post that isn't even responding to me.\n I've changed my mind, marc. You really should be banned. \n\n \n Well, go cry to administration about it then. Maybe he'll compare your violation of forum rules with mine, and reach a conclusion on who should be banned. But I hope you're not banned, you're too much fun. \n \n If you don't want me responding to your emotional posts, don't make emotional posts. \n \n \nThis is just ridiculous.

   "I don't consider you to be knowledgable in Catholicism.\n\n Do you consider Kenneth Miller -- a Catholic -- to be knowledgeable in Catholicism? I would. You've said repeatedly that you've read his book. Were you lying? Because his book clearly explains this. How about the Pope? Do you consider the Pope knowledgeable about Catholicism. I would. Do you pay any attention to this stuff, marc, or do you still turn the blind eye to those things you don't like so that you can continue to wallow in your willful ignorance?\n \n \n\"Outright rejects it\". Any links at all?\n\n Here's one.\n \"The position of the Catholic Church on the theory of evolution has moved over the last two centuries from a large period of no official mention, to a statement of neutrality in the 1950s, to a more explicit acceptance in recent years.\"\n \n \n\"In his encyclical Humani Generis (1950), my predecessor Pius XII has already affirmed that there is no conflict between evolution and the doctrine of the faith regarding man and his vocation, provided that we do not lose sight of certain fixed points....Today, more than a half-century after the appearance of that encyclical, some new findings lead us toward the recognition of evolution as more than an hypothesis. In fact it is remarkable that this theory has had progressively greater influence on the spirit of researchers, following a series of discoveries in different scholarly disciplines. The convergence in the results of these independent studies -- which was neither planned nor sought -- constitutes in itself a significant argument in favor of the theory.\" [bold added]\n --Pope John Paul II, 22Oct1996\n\n \n \n\"... While there is little consensus among scientists about how the origin of this first microscopic life is to be explained, there is general agreement among them that the first organism dwelt on this planet about 3.5 - 4 billion years ago. Since it has been demonstrated that all living organisms on earth are genetically related, it is virtually certain that all living organisms have descended from this first organism. Converging evidence from many studies in the physical and biological sciences furnishes mounting support for some theory of evolution to account for the development and diversification of life on earth, while controversy continues over the pace and mechanisms of evolution.\" [bold and color added]\n --statement from the International Theological Commission, endorsed by Cardinal Ratzinger (now Pope Benedict XVI), July 2004\n\n \n \n\"We cannot say: creation or evolution, inasmuch as these two things respond to two different realities. The story of the dust of the earth and the breath of God, which we just heard, does not in fact explain how human persons come to be but rather what they are. It explains their inmost origin and casts light on the project that they are. And, vice versa, the theory of evolution seeks to understand and describe biological developments. But in so doing it cannot explain where the 'project' of human persons comes from, nor their inner origin, nor their particular nature. To that extent we are faced here with two complementary -- rather than mutually exclusive -- realities.\"\n --Cardinal Ratzinger, In the Beginning: A Catholic Understanding of the Story of Creation and the Fall [Eerdmans, 1986, 1995]\nThat, friends, is an explicit rejection of young-earth creationism. The poofy magic of \"dust to man\" is not the accepted explanation of the actual occurrences, according to the Catholic church.\n \n \nAnd I explained to you that it has a chapter entitled \"Living in the GODLESS universe\". I explained to you before what the suffix \"less\" means, but you missed it.\n\n Unlike you, I can read. I know that the suffix \"-less\" means. But I also know that books have text for a reason. You want to ignore the text. Why, marc, why? Why do you want to ignore the text of the book that you says uses its text to argue against all gods? Or are you saying that the text really doesn't argue all gods, but you have to lie and say that it does?\n \n \nNeither one. Attendance in this case means that the museum does have support, that atheists claim it doesn't have.\n\n Did I claim that it had \"no support\"? I don't remember claiming that. There are a disgustingly large number of willfully scientifically ignorant religio-bots who throw away their money. Now, I'll say that there's no evidential support for their claims, but you know the saying: never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups.\n \n \nYou're outdoing me about 2 to 1, in the dataless claims department.\n\n Another lie. You made a claim. I asked you to back it up. You are now REFUSING TO BACK UP YOUR CLAIM. Shameless. Pathetic. Dishonest. And you call yourself a good Christian, don't you?\n SUPPORT YOUR CLAIM.\n Just for the record, you'll find above where I supported my statements that you challenged. It's one thing for me to present a claim without evidence because I really don't think that you're clueless enough to deny its factual basis; it's another thing to just make stuff up. When you challenge, I support. When I challenge, you never support. I'd make a ratio out of that, but since you can't divide by zero without calculus, you probably won't understand that I support my points infinitely more often than do you.\n \n \nReputable link?\n\n Above.\n \n \nA properly titled book is summarized by it's cover. For example, if a book has \"how science shows that God does not exist\" on it's cover, it doesn't make sense that a reading of the book would show something different. The book would show it in more detail. \n\n That's just f***ing amazing. marc is actually arguing that we don't need to read the text of a book. Clearly, Kenneth Miller's book entitled Finding Darwin's God is about how Dr. Miller counted to 100, searched all over, and then finally saw God hiding behind a tree.\n \n \nYes I did, Miller showed no knowledge of the very basics of Christianity. (you know, original sin, Biblical genealogy, things like that.)\n\n No, Miller just showed no adherence to many of the beliefs that you have. Of course, that qualifies him as a closet atheist to you, but that's another issue that you seriously should seek professional help with.\n \n \nThat the earth needs to be old.\n\n Really? You mean all of the evolution we've seen since 1850 hasn't really happened? The sun needs to be shining and the water cycle needs to proceed and DNA base pairs needs to bond, so is chemistry really a perversion of \"Darwinism\"? Did Lavoisier have the secret backhanded intent of proving evolutionary theory with his chemistry research decades before Darwin was even born? Our understanding of first-order reaction rate laws clearly have been fudged in order to make radiometric dating give the dates we want, right marc? Even though the very same applications accurately describe every other first-order reaction?\n Gee, marc, why didn't you answer my other questions? Why does \"Darwinism\" rely upon cosmology? Why does \"Darwinism\" rely upon astronomy? WHY, MARC? Why won't you answer these questions, marc? Why won't you support your lies, marc?\n \n \nYou've outdone me 2 to 1 in the non answer dept, as well as the proof dept.\n\n Another lie and another evasion. Even if it were true that I never once backed up a single point, it doesn't excuse you from the same standard of evidence.\n Why won't you answer these questions, marc? Why won't you support your lies, marc?\n \n \nThaaaats right, I took it out of context - you could have had a very understandable reason in bringing up the possibility of my violating chickens, chickens could very well have been the subject of that discussion.\n\n Post the entire passage, marc. Go ahead. With a link so that everybody can see. Do it. I dare you. If you are right, then you should have no trouble showing that I seriously tried to make the case that you violate chickens.\n We're waiting. Where's the passage? Where's the link, marc? Where's the evidence? Where's the proof that you aren't a quote mining, slanderous liar? Why can't you prove that you're not a quote mining, slanderous liar?\n \n \n \nDid you learn that in college, or on the second grade playground?\n\n I learned to parody in my college logic course. I've told you about it many times. It's mentioned in my Introduction to Philosophy textbook as well. Say, did you enroll in a logic course like I asked you to? Did you ever get your hands on a logic book like I recommended?\n \n \nThere's your lie, I've never complained to administration about you.\n\n Not a lie, but a faulty -- albeit logical -- assumption. Somebody reported several of my posts that responded to you. admin told me to stop calling you names, so I explained that I made it clear in that post what I was doing. He gave me the OK, but I stopped anyway because I'll respect his wishes when they are reasonable. I'll retract my statement that you ran crying to admin.\n \n \nIt's simple all right - I honestly don't think you're an adult.\n\n Look, if you want to proclaim that some little kid is beating you silly with the Truth Stick of No Mercy&#8482;, feel free. I really don't see how that helps you. I'd be ashamed if one of my students took me to town on a subject of which I claim mastery in the same way that I'm slaughtering your every point.\n \n \nMore playground logic?\n\n Parody is valid counterargument. Apparently I have my answer about the logic course.\n \n \nSure it is, according to you. You can get me in last-word battles everytime. I get bored with you fairly easily.\n\n I wouldn't enjoy being humiliated if I were in your shoes, either.\n \n \nIt's the opposition thing that you're not getting. Opposition to religion has many of the characteristics of religion.\n\n So does baseball fandom and the opposition of Met fans to the Yankees. Does that make baseball a religion, or does that just deify the Mets and the Yankees?\n \n \nI do the same with evolution. I believe it, but only as an allegory. It didn't really happen, but study of it is very important. The search for Tiikaliik rosae was very satisfying for those who went on the expedition. If it made them happy, I'm all for it.\n\n Look, a complete evasion of the fact that you pretended that I said something that I didn't. You don't even have the intellectual integrity or honesty to fess up when you lie shamelessly.\n Equally importantly, your statement above makes no sense. You're scrambling so frantically to come up with any response that you're saying.. hell, I don't even know how one could believe evolution as an allegory. And dumbly overlooking the fact that Tiktaalik was found precisely where it was predicted by evolutionary theory to be doesn't seem to bother you, does it?\n \n \nI do it all the time - that's why you're so angry.\n\n You didn't do it once in that post.

No, I object to the fact that you're shamelessly dishonest. Are these two things even remotely analogous? No. So why are you trying to make this the issue? Because you're shamelessly dishonest!\n \n \nYou'd have to read my posts 36, 39, and 58 to see just how much you just lied about the content of my posts.\n\n 39 is nothing but deceit.

In 59 you begin by again claiming that books need only a title and don't need pages.\n \n \nI can say that atheism lies. Habitually. For money, PUBLIC money.

Can't respond substantively, can't provide any counterargument. All you can do is change a word here and there and pretend that you've created a parody. (And yet you deny that parody is a valid counterargument...) The problem, marc, is that a parody needs to be based on an accurate analogy. Unless you can show that \"atheism\" lies in these ways, the analogy doesn't exist.",

   "No link I see. I don't consider you to be knowledgable in Catholicism.\n \n \n \n \n \"Outright rejects it\". Any links at all?\n\n Already provided by Electrolyte, and here's a few more religious organizations that reject YEC:\n \n Linky\n \n \n \nNeither one. Attendance in this case means that the museum does have support, that atheists claim it doesn't have.\n\n You stated that the majority of those attending the Creation Museum were Catholic. You were asked to support this assertion. This is your response? \n \n \nYou're outdoing me about 2 to 1, in the dataless claims department.\n\n I'd say you're holding your own. The main things 'lyte didn't provide links for are those he, and most others, would consider common sense; such as the rejection of YEC by Catholicism and the majority of other Christian denominations.\n \n \n \nThaaaats right, I took it out of context - you could have had a very understandable reason in bringing up the possibility of my violating chickens, chickens could very well have been the subject of that discussion. \n\n Or, he could have, y'know, explained that it was a parody of your method of argument and that he was using it to demonstrate the absurdity of your approach. Wait, he did do that. Both in the original thread, and in the post above.\n \n Do you read what's posted at all Marc?\n \n \nIt's the opposition thing that you're not getting. Opposition to religion has many of the characteristics of religion. \n\n What? Does this make sense to anyone at all besides Marc?\n \n \n \nI do the same with evolution. I believe it, but only as an allegory. It didn't really happen, but study of it is very important. The search for Tiikaliik rosae was very satisfying for those who went on the expedition. If it made them happy, I'm all for it. \n\n OK, please explain the allegorical nature of evolution to us Marc. I'm waiting.\n \n \nI do it all the time - that's why you're so angry.\n\n I imagine if he's angry, it's for the same reason I get steamed reading your posts-they are nonsensical, contradictory, lacking in logic, and usually full of smarmy \"wit\" that does not actually seem clever to anyone but yourself. They also in no way address the points brought up, and any refutations or questions about your presented points are generally outright ignored. This does not \"drive us into a frenzy\", it makes us bang our heads in despair about the state of education in the US.\n \n \nIt is fun to watch you sputter with rage and never concede a point, but it does get boring at times. I can say that atheism lies. Habitually. For money, PUBLIC money. Under the ruse of promoting evolution. Militant evolutionists are whoring themselves out under the guise of being evolutionists.\n\n Case in point. Here we have you stating that a large number of people, whom you have never met, are all habitual liars who are part of a vast conspiracy to bilk the world public out of large sums of money. You say this with a straight face, with absolutely no backing evidence. Let me reiterate:\n You claim a vast worldwide conspiracy to defraud the global public, a conspiracy which has been ongoing for the last 200 years and involves some of the brightest minds in the history of civilization. A conspiracy which involves people from all political and religious persuasions, and from all nationalities, and in the entire history of this conspiracy, there has been no actual \"leaks\" to confirm the existence of said conspirators.\n And this strikes you as a logical, well-reasoned statement.",

   "Do you consider Kenneth Miller -- a Catholic -- to be knowledgeable in Catholicism? I would. You've said repeatedly that you've read his book. Were you lying? Because his book clearly explains this. \n\n \n Are you lying? His book is almost all about evolution, and doesn't address Catholicism at all. \n \n \nHow about the Pope? Do you consider the Pope knowledgeable about Catholicism. I would. Do you pay any attention to this stuff, marc, or do you still turn the blind eye to those things you don't like so that you can continue to wallow in your willful ignorance? \n\n \n \n Uh, speaking of blind eyes, I quoted the Pope in post #58. You missed it. Let's try it again;\n \nPope John Paul puts it this way;\n \n Quote:\n Another threat to be reckoned with is \"scientism.\" This is the philosophical notion which refuses to admit the validity of forms of knowledge other than those of the positive sciences; and it relegates religious, theological, ethical and aesthetic knowledge to the realm of mere fantasy. In the past, the same idea emerged in positivism and neo-positivism, which considered metaphysical statements to be meaningless. Critical epistemology has discredited such a claim, but now we see it revived in the new guise of scientism, which dismisses values as mere products of the emotions and rejects the notion of being in order to clear the way for pure and simple facticity. Science would thus be poised to dominate all aspects of human life through technological progress. The undeniable triumphs of scientific research and contemporary technology have helped to propagate a scientistic outlook, which now seems boundless, given its inroads into different cultures and the radical changes it has brought. \n\n \n He's saying that science should not be poised to dominate all aspects of human life through technological progress. Maybe he's saying that science oversteps its bounds when it declares the book of Genesis to be wrong. That science is over stepping its authority when it declares the book of Genesis to be wrong. \n \n \nHere's one.\n \"The position of the Catholic Church on the theory of evolution has moved over the last two centuries from a large period of no official mention, to a statement of neutrality in the 1950s, to a more explicit acceptance in recent years.\"\n \n \n \n \n \n That, friends, is an explicit rejection of young-earth creationism. The poofy magic of \"dust to man\" is not the accepted explanation of the actual occurrences, according to the Catholic church. \n\n \n Is Cardinal Ratzinger a spokesman for all of the Catholic church? \n As I've gone over in previous threads in past years, some spokesmen at certain times in the Catholic church make fuzzy statements to stay out of political battles that may interfere with what it considers to be more important work. I didn't see \"explicit rejection\" of the Biblical account of creation anywhere in those links. If you want to claim that the Catholic church is more in agreement with atheists than it is with Protestants concerning origins, you can go right ahead. Call me all the vulgar names you want. \n \n \n \n \nUnlike you, I can read. I know that the suffix \"-less\" means. But I also know that books have text for a reason. You want to ignore the text. Why, marc, why? Why do you want to ignore the text of the book that you says uses its text to argue against all gods? Or are you saying that the text really doesn't argue all gods, but you have to lie and say that it does? \n\n \n In the chapter called \"living in the Godless universe\" it has some other headings; \"Is religion useful?\" Not some religion, but any religion. Another heading is \"The negative impact of religion on society\". Not some religion on society, but any religion on society. The only gods he allows are those that are no political threat whatsoever to atheistic philosophies of some scientists. As I believe I said before, he mainly allows gods to exist that are mocking inventions of atheism, like the flying spaghetti monster, etc. No matter how dignified, how serious an atheist author is, he would never consider failing to amuse himself and his readers by not leaving room for the flying spaghetti monster. \n \n \nDid I claim that it had \"no support\"? I don't remember claiming that. \n \n \n Well you had helpers, please forgive me if I can't keep you all straight. You and your helpers implied that it didn't have the support of mainstream Christianity. Its attendance records are strong indicators that it does. \n \n \nThat's just f***ing amazing. marc is actually arguing that we don't need to read the text of a book. Clearly, Kenneth Miller's book entitled Finding Darwin's God is about how Dr. Miller counted to 100, searched all over, and then finally saw God hiding behind a tree. \n\n \n Miller's book sure doesn't have much about God in it. He touches on it briefly a time or two - on page 256, 257 he proclaims an \"obvious conflict\" between Genesis 1 and 2, just like atheists, even though there is actually no conflict whatsoever.\n \n \nNo, Miller just showed no adherence to many of the beliefs that you have. Of course, that qualifies him as a closet atheist to you, but that's another issue that you seriously should seek professional help with. \n\n \n No professional help necessary, all I have to do is read Miller's drivel, compare it to atheism, then open the Bible and see what the truth is. \n \n Miller;\n \n[Genesis] chapter 1 describes the simultaneous creation of man and woman in the same verse (27)\n \n \"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them\". \n\n \n Where did you find the word \"simultaneous\" Mr. Miller? Did you get it from a Victor Stenger book? \n \n He continues;\n \nIn chapter 1 we don't learn exactly how the creation was accomplished, and we don't learn the actual substance from which male and female were formed. But in Chapter 2 the story is told again, and in verse 7 we read something quite different:\n \n \"And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.\"\n \n This time man is made first; and before the woman is created, a great deal happens.....only much later, when Adam goes to sleep, is Eve, the first woman created. The obvious conflict between these two accounts.....\n\n \n There is no conflict if his (and atheists) word \"simultaneous\" is taken out. Why did Miller use it? Why doesn't he see that chapter 1 was a simple summary, an overview, of what was described in more detail in chapter 2? \n Quote:\n \n \nReally? You mean all of the evolution we've seen since 1850 hasn't really happened? \n\n \n No, I mean that the entire evolution package, common ancestry and all that, require an old earth. I didn't realize there were claims that there has been evolution since 1850 - that must be a new one. What has evolved in the human body since 1850? \n \n \n \nOriginally Posted by marc9000 \n Thaaaats right, I took it out of context - you could have had a very understandable reason in bringing up the possibility of my violating chickens, chickens could very well have been the subject of that discussion. \n\n \n Post the entire passage, marc. Go ahead. With a link so that everybody can see. Do it. I dare you. If you are right, then you should have no trouble showing that I seriously tried to make the case that you violate chickens.\n We're waiting. Where's the passage? Where's the link, marc? Where's the evidence? Where's the proof that you aren't a quote mining, slanderous liar? Why can't you prove that you're not a quote mining, slanderous liar?\n \n \n It was the creation(intelligent design) thread, it was started by 'The Skeptic', you remember him, his last post on these forums was #16 in that thread. You bullied him out of here in that thread with your post #20 Check it out, you called him deluded, spoke of \"horsecrap\", used the f-word and at least one other 4 letter word, spoke of \"religio-nuts\", etc. But much later, in post #264, was where you really got angry with me for posting the Jeff Stueber link, and you became angry because you knew I wouldn't bully away so easily. That's when your \"chickenloving\" started. There were a lot of posters there, you were already sputtering with rage at Archangel, and then there was post #290;\n \n \nQuote:\n Originally Posted by marc9000 \n If the ACLU is using Dawkins books to argue that religion is some mysterious quirk of evolution, to be equated with some type of mental retardation,\n\n \n \nAnd if you're too busy having wonderful sexy fun with those chickens...\n\n \n \n There were more, I may have missed one or two.\n \n \nAre you able to do that, chickenlover?\n\n \n \nRight, the EAC. Do you have any support for this conspiracy, chickenlover? \n\n \n \nIt's determined by the fact that he is making statements that he cannot back up and promoting them as truth. (You could say that makes him similar to a chickenlover.)\n\n \n \nQuote:\n Originally Posted by marc9000 \n Evolution may not have been directly used, but it was involved. The philosophy of purposlessness is involved in things like abortion, death penalty, gay marriage etc also.\n\n \n \nSHOW THE EVIDENCE, chickenlover. \n\n \n Let's use just this last one as an example. I was explaining how I believe a godless philosophy can be involved in controversial political decisions. I believe it's clear as we see political divides between the political parties, between the worldviews of those who support each party, and how party affiliation can correspond to views on things like abortion, the death penalty etc. It was MY opinion, from my worldview, based on what I've seen and experienced in my entire 53 years of life. If you didn't agree with it, the natural thing for you to do would have been to use YOUR experiences, from YOUR worldview, to explain why you disagreed with my view. That's what Peeling would have done, it's what Jaxian (starting at post #8)would have done, it's what Another Opinion would have done. Please check those links, and see what a good discussion looks like. I don't even remember who got the last word on them, and it doesn't matter at all. I didn't consider them a \"loser\" and I guarantee they didn't consider me one. We discuss it as far as we can, and when it's time to agree to disagree, it can be dropped with no hard feelings whatsoever. It's the way I think it should be, and I'd bet my bottom dollar that's the way administration likes to see it.\n \n To respond to an opinion by demanding evidence, combined with a middle-school locker room name call, corresponds strikingly with descriptions of a troll. \n \n \nAn \"Internet troll\" or \"Forum Troll\" or \"Message Board Troll\" is a person who posts outrageous message to bait people to answer. Forum Troll delights in sowing discord on the forums. A troll is someone who inspires flaming rhetoric, someone who is purposely provoking and pulling people into flaming discussion. Flaming discussions usually end with name calling and a flame war. \n\n \n Does your chickenlover comment correspond in any way with \"sowing discord\" do you think? Purposely provoking, pulling people into a flame war, maybe? If your logic textbook doesn't cover it, maybe you should put it on the shelf, and ponder it on your own, and try not to let no one but book authors do your thinking for you. \n \n \nLook, if you want to proclaim that some little kid is beating you silly with the Truth Stick of No Mercy\u0099, feel free. I really don't see how that helps you. I'd be ashamed if one of my students took me to town on a subject of which I claim mastery in the same way that I'm slaughtering your every point. \n\n \n How would you react if one of your students took you to town? Would you be angry? Call them names? \n \n \nSo does baseball fandom and the opposition of Met fans to the Yankees. Does that make baseball a religion, or does that just deify the Mets and the Yankees? \n\n \n Like I said, you're not getting it. Baseball, Mets, Yankees, they simply don't claim the book of Genesis is wrong, they don't take issue with religion. They just don't do it. \n \n \nLook, a complete evasion of the fact that you pretended that I said something that I didn't. You don't even have the intellectual integrity or honesty to fess up when you lie shamelessly.\n Equally importantly, your statement above makes no sense. You're scrambling so frantically to come up with any response that you're saying.. hell, I don't even know how one could believe evolution as an allegory. And dumbly overlooking the fact that Tiktaalik was found precisely where it was predicted by evolutionary theory to be doesn't seem to bother you, does it? \n\n \n It kinda does. Atheists seem to be able to magically find evidence to contradict Genesis, whenever they want to. \n \n \n39 is nothing but deceit. You pretended (lied) that AiG addresses creationism merely as a minor point and then used that misrepresentation to tie it to denominations in support of your earlier lie. In 59 you begin by again claiming that books need only a title and don't need pages. \n\n \n Post 59 was Trebors. I said nothing about \"pages\" in post #58 either.",

The sacred book likewise wishes to tell men that the world was not created as the seat of the gods, as was taught by other cosmogonies and cosmologies, but was rather created for the service of man and the glory of God.

   "Actually, anyones claim that Catholicism accepts Darwinism as it claims to accept evolution would be mistaken in their assumption according to this breakdown of the Popes speech.\n \n http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geu4uF99VHONoANm5XNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTE5NmE3ZjFqBHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDNwRjb2xvA2FjMgR2dGlkA0Y5MDBfMTI4BGwDV1Mx/SIG=11o8dgomd/EXP=1205291269/**http%3a//www.getreligion.org/%3fp=1863\n \n Here is an excerpt with the link:\n Pope Benedict XVI, dumb creationist?\n \n \n \"The purpose of our lives is to reveal God to men,\" he said, in St. Peter's Square. \"And only where God is seen does life truly begin. . . . We are not some casual and meaningless product of evolution. Each of us is the result of a thought of God. Each of us is willed, each of us is loved, each of us is necessary.\"\n \n So what is the pope concerned about? What is the Vatican trying to do?\n \n . . . (The) church has moved from neutrality to something like acceptance of evolutionary theory, though drawing a thick bottom line that God is the ultimate creator. In 1996, Pope John Paul declared evolution \"more than a hypothesis,\" and in 2004 as Cardinal Ratzinger, Pope Benedict endorsed the scientific view that the earth is roughly four billion years old and that species changed through evolution. Indeed, there has been no credible scientific challenge to the idea that evolution, the foundation of modern biology, explains the diversity of life on earth.\n \n Given that history, scientists and church experts say they cannot imagine the study session ending with any alignment of the pope or the church with intelligent design or American-style creationism, which often posits that Earth is only about 6,000 years old.\n \n Once again, there is that infamous quote from the late Pope John Paul II, the quote that totally misses the point of this debate - when seen from the point of view of Rome. Clearly, the Vatican accepts many ideas associated with the mechanisms of evolution, but, at the very least, the pope rejects the unprovable Darwinian doctrine that creation is the result of random and unguided changes. How would someone in a lab prove that changes are random? How could someone in a lab prove - absolutely - that they were guided and by whom?\n \n At some point, research must be interpreted. This is where science becomes philosophy and that is precisely where the Vatican debate is focused. You can tell that by reading what John Paul II actually said. Here is a section of a column I wrote on this topic for Scripps Howard News Service. I would bet the moon and the stars that this is the issue being discussed right now by the current pope and his students.\n \n Part of the problem is the 1996 papal address (by John Paul II) to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, with its familiar quotation that \"new knowledge leads us to recognize that the theory of evolution is more than a hypothesis.\"\n \n The question is whether John Paul said \"theory\" or \"theories.\" According to official translations, the pope said: \"Rather than the theory of evolution, we should speak of several theories of evolution. On the one hand, this plurality has to do with the different explanations advanced for the mechanism of evolution, and on the other, with the various philosophies on which it is based.\"\n \n The pope then rejected all theories arguing that humanity is the product of a random, unguided process of creation. Thus, he said that \"theories of evolution which, because of the philosophies which inspire them, regard the spirit either as emerging from the forces of living matter, or as a simple epiphenomenon of that matter, are incompatible with the truth about man.\"\n \n At the time John Paul II spoke these words, the National Association of Biology Teachers had officially defined evolution as an \"unsupervised, impersonal, unpredictable, and natural process . . . that is affected by natural selection, chance, historical contingencies and changing environments.\" Critics said this definition veered beyond science into theological speculation. Thus, in 1997 the association's board reversed itself and removed the words \"unsupervised\" and \"impersonal.\"\n \n This is where the debate must focus. It all comes back to that quite religious, doctrinaire statement by George Gaylord Simpson in the famous The Meaning of Evolution. That faith-based statement of naturalism is: \"Man is the result of a purposeless and natural process that did not have him in mind.\"\n \n Pope John Paul II disagreed. It appears that Benedict XVI does, too. Does that make this pope a stupid creationist? Does this put him \"on the wrong side of science\"?\n \n Stay tuned.\n On a side note. Isn't it interesting the the definition that the National Association of Biology Teachers had for evolution was exactly the same definition that I was just mercilessly attacked for insisting what the accepted definition was in another recent debate. Granted, the Board changed it in 97 due to political pressure within the scientific community, but that doesn't change the fact that only the words \"unsupervised\" and \"impersonal\" were removed. And here it is again.\n the National Association of Biology Teachers had officially defined evolution as an \"unsupervised, impersonal, unpredictable, and natural process . . . that is affected by natural selection.",

Scientism is a particular philosophy to which I do not ascribe. In fact, I don't recall ever having met a single scientist who did. Read carefully and you should be able to understand that the Pope was presenting the view of science held by the philosophy of scientism. That is not the view of science held by most scientists that I have known or read.\n \nIs Cardinal Ratzinger a spokesman for all of the Catholic church? \nYes. In fact he is.\n \nI didn&#8217;t see &#8220;explicit rejection&#8221; of the Biblical account of creation anywhere in those links. If you want to claim that the Catholic church is more in agreement with atheists than it is with Protestants concerning origins, you can go right ahead.\nBut you aren't a spokesman for Protestantism. Further, the Catholic Church teaches that parts of the Bible are not historical. Some examples are Genesis, Job, Jonah, Psalms and others. The Catholic Church was embarrassed by taking literal positions about the Bible in the past - the earth is not immovable nor is it the center of the universe. The Catholic Church prefers to stick to positions about faith and morals today. Creationism is not a dogma of the Roman Catholic Church.",

   "Are you lying? His book is almost all about evolution, and doesn't address Catholicism at all.\n\n What a crock. I've got the book right next to me. Out of nine chapters, the last three -- that's virtually a third of the book -- address his reconciliation of science with his religion: Catholicism. And you think I'm lying? Shameless, aren't you?\n \n \nUh, speaking of blind eyes, I quoted the Pope in post #58. You missed it. Let's try it again...\n \n He's saying that science should not be poised to dominate all aspects of human life through technological progress. Maybe he's saying that science oversteps its bounds when it declares the book of Genesis to be wrong. That science is over stepping its authority when it declares the book of Genesis to be wrong.\n\n Yes, he's saying that science shouldn't overstep its bounds. He's arguing that there are some aspects of the supernatural that can't be touched by science.\n Incredibly enough, I think I've heard that somewhere on these very forums before. A lot. You know, often. And directed at you. Oh yeah, that was me.\n Hell marc, can you make yourself any more of a laughingstock?\n Furthermore, this doesn't refute my statement, or any of the statements that I produced as evidence. Does your citation contradict my statements at all? Hell no. And yet you're pretending that you've countered my point. See Are Oh See Kay.\n \n \nIs Cardinal Ratzinger a spokesman for all of the Catholic church?\n\n I'm sorry, I just can't pass this up. It takes a special degree of either inability or unwillingness to familiarize oneself with even the FIRST fact about modern Catholicism while arguing about what modern Catholicism does or doesn't say.\n \n \nAs I've gone over in previous threads in past years, some spokesmen at certain times in the Catholic church make fuzzy statements to stay out of political battles that may interfere with what it considers to be more important work. I didn't see \"explicit rejection\" of the Biblical account of creation anywhere in those links.\n\n My. Dear. God. Now the entire Catholic Church is a secret atheist organization? Where's that DSM definition of delusion when you need it?\n \n \nIf you want to claim that the Catholic church is more in agreement with atheists than it is with Protestants concerning origins, you can go right ahead.\n\n If you want to continue claiming that I'm saying things that I clearly have not, then I'll take steps to prevent you from claiming anything at all on this forum.\n \n \nCall me all the vulgar names you want.\n\n I'll stick with \"laughingstock\" after this post. It's a doozie. \n \n \nIn the chapter called \"living in the Godless universe\" it has some other headings; \"Is religion useful?\" Not some religion, but any religion. Another heading is \"The negative impact of religion on society\". Not some religion on society, but any religion on society.\n\n Again, what does the text say? Hmm? Why do you keep trying to make your cases with titles and headers instead of the actual contextual claims? That's the kind of behavior we expect from liars and hacks. Are you trying to help us prove our points?\n \n \nThe only gods he allows are those that are no political threat whatsoever to atheistic philosophies of some scientists.\n\n This is rich. The atheistic scientists only allow some theistic beliefs? Well are they atheistic or not, marc? Godd*mn, man, more theistic atheists/atheistic theists? It's atheistic theistic evolutionists all over again!\n Congratulations: you've cornered the market on laughingstock.\n \n \nAs I believe I said before, he mainly allows gods to exist that are mocking inventions of atheism, like the flying spaghetti monster, etc.\n\n Unabashed lie. He claims that he cannot disprove the generic concept of God. It's like you're saying that belief in a nonspecific concept of a god is atheistic. Yep, atheistic theism. That's like a negative positive number or a false true statement. It also shows that you are probably covered by the DSM.\n \n \nWell you had helpers, please forgive me if I can't keep you all straight. You and your helpers implied that it didn't have the support of mainstream Christianity. Its attendance records are strong indicators that it does.\n\n You keep saying this, but you haven't provided any evidence. Why not, marcky marc? You made the claim, I challenged your claim, YOU EVADED SUPPORTING YOUR CLAIM, we nailed you on your evasion, and now you're repeating your bare assertion. If you are correct, why the hell can't you prove it? Hmm?\n \n \nMiller's book sure doesn't have much about God in it. He touches on it briefly a time or two - on page 256, 257 he proclaims an \"obvious conflict\" between Genesis 1 and 2, just like atheists, even though there is actually no conflict whatsoever.\n\n \"Sure doesn't have much about God in it?\" Okay, I'll prove either that you're full of cr*p or that your logic is pathetic. I think I'll prove both, but I'll expose your absurdity in such a way that defending one claim damns the other.OMG man, the book is called FINDING DARWIN'S GOD! How can you say it's NOT ABOUT GOD!?~!? The name GOD are right there in the title. In fact, the last chapter is called FINDING DARWIN'S GOD! GOD! GOD! One of the headings in Chapter 7 is \"THE ARCHITECT\" which refers to God! GOD, man, GOD! Another heading is called \"THE MIND OF GOD\"! GOD, marc, GOD! In Chapter 8 there are three bolded lines; each one says GOD in it! GOD!And I'm not even to Chapter 9. Now, you can either claim that titles and headings mean something, which damns your argument that Miller's book doesn't talk about God, or you can maintain that Miller's book doesn't talk about God, in which case you must reject the postulation that titles and headings are necessarily complete descriptions of the text. Or, you can continue your willful suspension of any semblance of sanity and have the double standard. Hell, why not? You're already a laughingstock. You have nothing to lose.\n \n Of course, if you choose the latter, all I have to do is quote pretty much any couple of paragraphs from the last three chapters of the book and show that you're completely off your rocker.\n \n \nNo professional help necessary, all I have to do is read Miller's drivel, compare it to atheism, then open the Bible and see what the truth is.\n\n marc, your reading comprehension is so poor (as shown above) that I really don't give a damn what you think you can do by reading.\n \n \nWhere did you find the word \"simultaneous\" Mr. Miller? Did you get it from a Victor Stenger book?\n\n Do you have any evidence that he got it from a Victor Stenger book, marc? No, just more dishonest faux bravado. Laughingstock. \n \n \nThere is no conflict if his (and atheists) word \"simultaneous\" is taken out.\n\n Oh, look, lumping a Catholic in with atheists.\n Laughingstock.\n \n \nNo, I mean that the entire evolution package, common ancestry and all that, require an old earth.\n\n Yet evidence for and widespread acceptance of an old earth existed before Darwin even boarded the Beagle. So old earth geology was fabricated on a whim decades before evolution because Hutton magically knew that Darwin would come along and revolutionize biology? Really, marc, can this get any more pathetic?\n \n \nI didn't realize there were claims that there has been evolution since 1850 - that must be a new one.\n\n marc, it's 158 years old. All this shows is that there's a sh*tload that you don't \"realize\" about evolution.\n \n \nPost the entire passage, marc. Go ahead. With a link so that everybody can see. Do it. I dare you. If you are right, then you should have no trouble showing that I seriously tried to make the case that you violate chickens.\n We're waiting. Where's the passage? Where's the link, marc? Where's the evidence? Where's the proof that you aren't a quote mining, slanderous liar? Why can't you prove that you're not a quote mining, slanderous liar?\n \n\n \n It was the creation(intelligent design) thread, it was started by 'The Skeptic', you remember him, his last post on these forums was #16 in that thread. You bullied him out of here in that thread with your post #20 Check it out, you called him deluded, spoke of \"horsecrap\", used the f-word and at least one other 4 letter word, spoke of \"religio-nuts\", etc. But much later, in post #264, was where you really got angry with me for posting the Jeff Stueber link, and you became angry because you knew I wouldn't bully away so easily. That's when your \"chickenloving\" started. There were a lot of posters there, you were already sputtering with rage at Archangel, and then there was post #290;\n\n So I challenge you to post the entire passage where I originate the chickenlover moniker, and instead of doing that, you attack me for kicking TheSkeptic's XXX? Why won't you post the passage, marc?\n Post the entire passage, marc. Go ahead. With a link so that everybody can see. Do it. I dare you. If you are right, then you should have no trouble showing that I seriously tried to make the case that you violate chickens.\n We're waiting. Where's the passage? Where's the link, marc? Where's the evidence? Where's the proof that you aren't a quote mining, slanderous liar? Why can't you prove that you're not a quote mining, slanderous liar?\n \n \nSHOW THE EVIDENCE, chickenlover.\n Let's use just this last one as an example.\n\n Yes, let's. Did I emphasize the moniker or the demand that you show the evidence for your claim? I think it's quite clear.\n Let's also note that YOU STILL HAVEN'T POSTED EITHER ANY PASSAGES OR ANY SUPPORT FOR YOUR CLAIM. Fancy that.\n I'm sorry, but I just can't come up with anything new. I can use adjectives like \"absolute\" and \"incredible,\" but I'm still stuck with \"laughingstock.\"\n \n \nTo respond to an opinion by demanding evidence, combined with a middle-school locker room name call, corresponds strikingly with descriptions of a troll.\nAn \"Internet troll\" or \"Forum Troll\" or \"Message Board Troll\" is a person who posts outrageous message to bait people to answer. Forum Troll delights in sowing discord on the forums. A troll is someone who inspires flaming rhetoric, someone who is purposely provoking and pulling people into flaming discussion. Flaming discussions usually end with name calling and a flame war.\n\n\n Gee marc, that seems a hell of a lot more like you than it does me. I provide evidence, I don't lie, and I don't spin your statements to try to make them say what you didn't actually claim.\n \n \nDoes your chickenlover comment correspond in any way with \"sowing discord\" do you think? Purposely provoking, pulling people into a flame war, maybe? If your logic textbook doesn't cover it, maybe you should put it on the shelf, and ponder it on your own, and try not to let no one but book authors do your thinking for you.\n\n Look, Mr. Laughingstock, I made it very clear that I was not making the case that you're a chicken violator but that I was exposing the absolutely baseless nature of your claims. That's parody, Holmes. It's not my fault you don't get it.\n \n \nHow would you react if one of your students took you to town? Would you be angry? Call them names?\n\n They don't. Period. They aren't stupid enough. Too bad I can't say the same about most of the people I butt heads online.\n \n \nLike I said, you're not getting it. Baseball, Mets, Yankees, they simply don't claim the book of Genesis is wrong, they don't take issue with religion. They just don't do it.\n\n I never said they did. F***ing hell, will you ever get a logic book? Ever?\n \n \nIt kinda does. Atheists seem to be able to magically find evidence to contradict Genesis, whenever they want to.\n\n You think not having our heads up our asses and not being willfully ignorant of the facts is magic? This explains a lot! Anybody can find boatloads of evidence to contradict Genesis because there is boatloads of evidence to contradict Genesis!\n \n \nI said nothing about \"pages\" in post #58 either.\n\n You didn't use the word, but you argued against using the actual text of the book in lieu of judging the book entirely by its cover. Utter absurdity. How pathetic.",

   "Actually, anyones claim that Catholicism accepts Darwinism as it claims to accept evolution would be mistaken in their assumption according to this breakdown of the Popes speech...\n Clearly, the Vatican accepts many ideas associated with the mechanisms of evolution, but, at the very least, the pope rejects the unprovable Darwinian doctrine that creation is the result of random and unguided changes.\n\n That's funny, \"Darwinism\" doesn't say anything about \"creation\" being the result of only \"random and unguided changes.\" In fact, it specifically describes nonrandom changes.\n \n Your blog author is a hack.

Isn't it interesting the the definition that the National Association of Biology Teachers had for evolution was exactly the same definition that I was just mercilessly attacked for insisting what the accepted definition was in another recent debate.

It was your opinion, based on what you've seen and experienced in the area where you live.

Now, you can either claim that titles and headings mean something, which damns your argument that Miller's book doesn't talk about God, or you can maintain that Miller's book doesn't talk about God, in which case you must reject the postulation that titles and headings are necessarily complete descriptions of the text. Or, you can continue your willful suspension of any semblance of sanity and have the double standard. Hell, why not? You're already a laughingstock. You have nothing to lose. \n\n \n \n I could do a third thing! I could say..... IT DEPENDS ON THE BOOK!! I can read the TEXT of Stengers book and find that it agrees perfectly with the headings, and then I can read the TEXT of Millers book and find that it does NOT support the headings very well. There was plenty of atheist drivel in Stengers book, and practically NO Bible verses in Millers book! They were two different books by two different authors - there are no book writing rules that say all books must conform to the same standards in how well they support their headings and titles. Common sense tells me that each book should be judged on those things on a case by case basis. \n \n Now tell me if one book doesn't support its titles and headings, it's NOT POSSIBLE for another book to support its titles and headings. Why not? You are already sputtering with rage. \n \n \nOf course, if you choose the latter, all I have to do is quote pretty much any couple of paragraphs from the last three chapters of the book and show that you're completely off your rocker. \n\n \n Please do that. Start with any reference to Catholicism. \n \n \nDo you have any evidence that he got it from a Victor Stenger book, marc? No, just more dishonest faux bravado. Laughingstock. \n\n \n More eye shutting and ear holding. He was trying to show a conflict between Genesis 1 and 2, just like atheists often do. \n \n \n Originally posted by electrolyte Post the entire passage, marc. Go ahead. With a link so that everybody can see. Do it. I dare you. If you are right, then you should have no trouble showing that I seriously tried to make the case that you violate chickens.\n We're waiting. Where's the passage? Where's the link, marc? Where's the evidence? Where's the proof that you aren't a quote mining, slanderous liar? Why can't you prove that you're not a quote mining, slanderous liar? \n\n ____________________________________________________\n \n \nOriginally posted by marc9000 It was the creation(intelligent design) thread, it was started by 'The Skeptic', you remember him, his last post on these forums was #16 in that thread. You bullied him out of here in that thread with your post #20 Check it out, you called him deluded, spoke of \"horsecrap\", used the f-word and at least one other 4 letter word, spoke of \"religio-nuts\", etc. But much later, in post #264, was where you really got angry with me for posting the Jeff Stueber link, and you became angry because you knew I wouldn't bully away so easily. That's when your \"chickenloving\" started. There were a lot of posters there, you were already sputtering with rage at Archangel, and then there was post \n #290;\n\n _______________________________________________\n \n \nSo I challenge you to post the entire passage where I originate the chickenlover moniker, and instead of doing that, you attack me for kicking TheSkeptic's XXX? Why won't you post the passage, marc? \n\n \n \n INSTEAD OF DOING THAT? How about reading it again, especially this part;\n \n \", in post #264, was where you really got angry with me for posting the Jeff Stueber link, and you became angry because you knew I wouldn't bully away so easily. That's when your \"chickenloving\" started.\"\n \n How many times are you going to ask me to do the same thing over and over???\n \n \n I can use adjectives like \"absolute\" and \"incredible,\" but I'm still stuck with \"laughingstock.\" \n\n \n \n F***ing hell, will you ever get a logic book? Ever? \n\n \n There you go laughing again. emoticon_emb",

   "I haven't been feeling well, so I'll have to do what amounts to a substantive but short drive-by.\n \n Just because Miller doesn't elaborate using the word \"Catholicism\" doesn't mean a damn thing. Out of the several times I've been at church, I don't recall anyone ever making it explicit that their beliefs were Methodist, or Baptist, or Presbyterian, or even generically \"Protestant.\" To them, they're Christian. It seems to be the case with Miller, too. You said that the book \"doesn't talk about God much at all,\" which is completely untrue. You can't cover up your deception by now arguing that he doesn't discuss Catholicism by name.\n \n You might believe that different people think that science has the capability to test the supernatural, but that opinion is based on ignorance of science. It's really not my problem -- or a Catholic's problem -- that you or AiG are scientifically illiterate.\n \n You think I'm arguing that the Pope re-programs his followers? Care to take that up with a Catholic? Besides, as my link showed, acceptance of evolution is not a new phenomenon in the Catholic Church.\n \n My statement that you seem to be building arguments that all evolutionists are closet atheists is nothing new and has been ragged upon by more people than just me. It's not like I'm making it up. The fact that it looks even more like delusion now than ever -- so much so that you're trying to deny it -- is just funny.\n \n I'm not planning on killing you. When I say that I'll take steps to stop your lying, your dishonesty, your spinning, and your intentional misrepresentation on this forum, I mean I'll go to admin and tell him that enough is enough. Only you would take a statement that I would so something about your behavior on this forum and decide to paint it as a death threat. Pathetic.\n \n \"Trying to be brief\" is what the titles and headers do. If there's no need for elaboration, there would be no text. Is there text? There is? But it can't be important enough to put in a book so that people will read it, right marc? Oh, wait... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n Of course some atheists don't mind some theism. I don't mind theism. I mind adherence to baseless and illogical beliefs. I hate ignorance, dishonesty, willing delusion, and the unwillingness to support one's points. Describes you to a T.\n \nUnabashed lie. He claims that he cannot disprove the generic concept of God. It's like you're saying that belief in a nonspecific concept of a god is atheistic. Yep, atheistic theism. That's like a negative positive number or a false true statement. It also shows that you are probably covered by the DSM.\n\n It's actually in Millers book.[/quote]\n And you think I have no reason to be upset with your behavior? I WAS TALKING ABOUT STENGER'S BOOK. I bust you for lying, so you pretend I'm talking about a different book? Do you work hard to make yourself a laughingstock, or does it just come naturally?\n \n \n\"Comfortable with\" - politically comfortable with.\n\n So you can quote it, then change the quote? It says \"comfortable with.\" You pretend that it says \"politically comfortable with.\" Does it say \"politically comfortable\" with?\n In fact, let's look at the REST OF THE SENTENCE.... I find that my agnostic and atheistic colleagues are generally comfortable with such ideas, but many believers are dumbfounded.\"\nDoes this look like he was referring to politics or reason? Let's look at the very next sentence.\"How can you reconcile divine will with a random chance process like evolution?\" is a common question.\nPerhaps you could -- between now and the next time you post -- learn how to read. No wonder you continue to argue that headings and titles are the only things that matter. You simply aren't capable of reading in context.\n \n You said that many Catholics attend the AiG creation museum. I challenged your claim. Now you're saying that it's an opinion.\n No, marc. \"Many Catholics attend the AiG creation museum\" is NOT an opinion. It is a \"fact\" for which you have no evidence and have admitted you have no evidence. Apparently, you think it's okay to LIE as long as you can later come back and say that it's just opinion. What a sham. What a crock. Pathetic, marc.\n \n My statement about local rejection of literalism is not my opinion, it was a statement of fact. You didn't go nuts about it because it wasn't an outlandish claim. You accuse me of bullying people into supporting statements they don't actually believe in order to \"appease\" me, but I don't bring it up. I don't even talk about it. I've told you several times that I don't dare mention the vast majority of this material due to fear of losing my job. Why would I risk my job by being an XXX about a touchy subject? But anything to support your delusion that real Christians must believe in Biblical inerrancy.\n \n I expose the idiocy of your \"titles and headers\" only double standard, so you try to fix it with a conditional double standard, i.e. a triple standard. You say whether a title can sum up the entire book \"DEPENDS ON THE BOOK.\"\n How long will you keep up this bullspit, marc? \"Only some books need text, and I'm the only one on the planet qualified to decide!!~@\" Looks like I need to trade Miller's book for the DSM.\n \n You ask me to post a couple of paragraphs of Miller's book that discuss God. Do you deny that these exist? You accuse me of trying to take up your time, but both you and Archie have established the norm of \"challenging\" claims that you don't even disbelieve and have no reason to disbelieve. YOU HAVE THE BOOK, marc; how in the hell can you possibly claim it doesn't discuss reconciliation between evolution and God?\n \n I challenge you to support your suggestion that Miller got his idea from Stenger's book. You fail to support and instead accuse me of ignoring facts. What facts am I ignoring, marc? Hmm?\n \n I asked you to post THE ACTUAL PASSAGE where I originated the \"chickenlover\" parody. You haven't done so. Why not? Why do you keep pretending that you posted THE ACTUAL PASSAGE when you haven't, marc? Why are you so afraid of posting what I actually said if what I actually said was so damnably contemptable?",

   "Mentioning it and demonstrating it are two different things. There's no detail about Catholisicm [sic] in his book \"Finding Darwin's God\".\nNo, they're not. Publicly professing one's faith is one way to demonstrate it. He also practices his faith openly, although he doesn't try to impose it on others against their wills like you do. The fact that there is no specific mention of Catholicism in his book is because the whole book is a reconciliation of his profession with his religion. He is an evolutionary biologist and he is a Roman Catholic. He has no perspective as a Protestant or a creationist. What he says about science and faith are from his perspective as a Roman Catholic.\n \nHis book that I took a lot of time to read shows no references to it.\nBut since you have no idea of the tenets of Catholicism, you couldn't possible know that Miller is talking about his religious beliefs. He certainly isn't arguing for a literal Biblical interpretation or young earth creationism. He actually does a very good job of presenting the view of the Catholic Church in the matter, a view that is mainstream Christian and diametrically opposed to what AIG claims.\n \nI couldn't say. You've made it clear in the past that you don't believe any of it - why do you take an interest in it? Unless of course, to downgrade it.\nAnd, of course, Miller also made it clear that he doesn't believe in any of it either. What I don't believe is your sort of claptrap. What I don't believe is that you are the purveyor of the one true faith. I attempt to downgrade attempts to present religious claptrap presented as if it were scientifically valid, or even reasonable.\n \n If you can't say, then how can you claim that you know more than Miller about Catholicism? That implies that you know more than I do. In fact, I probably know a bit more than Miller. Just how is it, do you think, that I came to have so many friends in the clergy of various religions?\n \nDawkins? Stenger? Talkorigins? Does the Pope agree with them all?\nOn some issues, certainly. One of those issues is the insanity of claiming that the earth is no more than 10,000 years old, that the report of the Garden of Eden or Noah's flood is anything more than an allegory, that the stories of Jonah or Job are more than mythological moral lessons. It just didn't happen.\n \nAre you an American, does George W Bush speak for you?\nCertainly not. Does he speak for you? He is so stupid that he believes that the earth is about 6,000 years old and that there is no evidence for evolution. I agree with most American who feel that we are not as well off as we were 8 years ago. But 8 years ago, I was much better off than I was 16 years ago.\n \nAs an evolutionist, does Richard Dawkins speak for you?\nCertainly not. Although he is an excellent author and has added new perspective to evolutionary biology, especially with his exchanges with Gould, I'm not all that into some of his ideas. The exchanges sharpened the ideas of both men and they had great respect for each other.\n \n But, of course, you are again being disingenuous. You are moving the goal posts. The question was whether Cardinal Ratzinger is the spokesman for the Catholic Church. Yes, he is. You can't escape you ignorance by pretending that the question was whether he spoke for me. By his position, Pope, he is by definition the spokesman for the Catholic Church. I am not the Catholic Church.\n \nNo, but outlines of Protestant beliefs about Biblical authority were in post #39, the one you ignored.\nActually, I didn't see that post #39 needed a response since you posted my objections and then failed to answer any of them.\n \nHow about Exodus, I wonder? Deuteronomy 34:7 says that Moses died at the age of 120 years, yet his eyes were not weak nor his strengh [sic] gone. I'm sure modern science can toss that out, does the Catholic church disregard that too?\nProbably allegorical. Exodus certainly isn't historical, although there may be some basis in history. There doesn't seem to be any trace of Israelite slaves in Egypt nor any signs that a population as large as that claimed by the Bible ever wandered in the Sinai.\n \nHow about Genesis, 9:29 - \"Altogether, Noah lived 950 years, and then he died\". Does the Catholic church toss that one out?\nProbably myth. Humans don't live that long.\n \nI'll bet Richard Dawkins, or electrolyte, could prove it false.\nI bet they couldn't. There isn't any evidence one way or the other. It is common knowledge that the ages of ancient leaders were exaggerated to enhance their wisdom and authority. The Bible and Hebrew mythology isn't the only holy book where that took place.\n \nThen there's this one, from Matthew 28:2; \"There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it. His appearance was like lightening, and his clothes were as white as snow\". Yes or no, what does the Catholic church think about that one?\nWhat does that have to do with the topic? Why do you keep moving to goal posts. Is it that you believe that if one word of the Bible is true, then it is all true? Is it that you believe that if one word if false then it is all false? So you don't know what allegories and morality stories are?\n \n Actually, the Catholic Church pretty much agrees with Matt 28:2. However, that isn't relevant to the whether any other book, chapter, verse, or phrase is literally true. The Catholic Church actually recognizes that Genesis represents the oral traditions of the Hebrews. That's why there are two creation stories. That's why there is some question about 2 pairs or 7 of any species. And, of course, the idea of clean v. unclean was defined in Leviticus, so it is reasonable to assume that Genesis was actually written after Leviticus and recounts older oral traditions.\n \nI'd just like to know where they draw the line - when to agree with atheists and when not to.\nWhat does atheism have to do with this discussion? Why do you assume that science is the same as atheism? Actually, it is a matter of agreement with certain christian cults that hold that the Bible is all the truth that matters, religiously and scientifically. The line is actually drawn at reasonable and rational. You accept without evidence moral truths and ethics, and you accept reality that is supported by observation and testing.\n \nDid Cardinal Ratzinger say that?\nNo. Actually it was his predecessor, John Paul II who admitted the error of the Catholic Church in claiming that the earth is the center of the universe. Took a few years, didn't it? But that is the nature of religion. Never admit an error even if you look foolish in not doing so. And John Paul II even said that evolution is more than a theory since it has been supported by observation, hypothesis, prediction, and testing to such an extent that it is no longer in doubt.\n \nIs there a passage in the Bible that says; \"thou shalt be embarrassed if thine atheist brethren mock thee?\"\nActually, that's pretty much what St. Augustin said about ignorant faith in the face of reality. But of course, St Augustin was a Roman Catholic and can be safely disregarded by more recent cults.",
