   "That republicans exist and that they are in power. That gay people are oppressed and discriminated against. That there are people homeless. That there are people that go hungry. That there are people who have lost their jobs to the greed of business. That there is religious extremism run rampant.\n\n \n I think the homeless problem and the hunger problem are always there\n no matter what party is in power. Even when Clinton was in office,\n those social problems were no better. Homeless people are always\n homeless regardless of economic situation. The only solution to that\n problem is education. If we can make sure that there are no high\n school dropouts, then the number of homeless people would be reduced\n sharply. The same thing for the hungry people. Education, education,\n education.\n \n As for the gay discrimination problem, it is too complicated. The science\n cannot answer the reason for the gay phenomenon. For the problem of jobless\n people, although it is a sad one, the unemployment rate is at 4.7% currently,\n that is not high at all. Right now, the high tech industry is\n booming. There is a great shortage for high tech people. The\n solution for the unemployment problem is still education. If you\n have the guts, you have a job. That is fair to everybody.\n \n I think the greed problem of business is exaggerated by some\n politicians. Most of the companies are not too bad, only a small\n portion of them are greedy like Enron. Don't blame the capitalism\n like a socialist. The idea of socialism is the worst.\n \n Republicans and Democrats have different views on those social\n problems. They should respect each other.",

   "The economy looks pretty good. The gas price is not high. What is wrong with the country?\n\n \n I don't consider any country driving its economy with unsustainable, abnormal public and personal debt to be good, especially the largest economy in the world. Combine that with the highest per-capita rate of incarceration in the developed world, an inbred failed manufacturing industry, migration to a two-tiered society of haves and have nots, fiscal inability to improve crumbling and outdated infrastructure for some of what's wrong with the US. We've become fat, lazy and refuse to accept the fact we're a declining empire. To maintain the facade, we accelerate the drain on our national wealth with armed aggression to maintain Petrodollar domination that supplies our massive debt requirements while our have-not population increases and growth of racism and mythical belief system legislation disguised as democratic patriotism removes civil rights. \n \n As to gas prices not being high, clogged commercial vehicle auctions are returning inefficient used SUVs and pickups back to dealerships with bulging inventories of new, inefficient SUVs and pickups. Any media source describes the desperate financial condition of the US vehicle manufacturing sector. That's the result of decades of poor management and a public coping with stagnated wages, understated inflation and migration to an internal transaction service economy plagued by debt from loss of value added exports.\n \n Not a pretty picture, but until the US public takes government back from entrenched, self-serving politicians it'll become far worse. Unfortunately, judging from the apathetic blind patriot posts swallowing government propaganda on this and other forums, it's going to be a hard fall before that change transpires.",
