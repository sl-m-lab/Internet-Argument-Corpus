   "I think Imma gonna convert to being a fundy Christian.\n \n I'm tired of not being paid by sychophants for spewing tired, trite rhetoric and hate-filled gibberish from a poorly translated bronze-age text.\n I'm tired of not being cheered on by the same tools when I take a stand against those of differing opinions, beliefs and practices.\n I'm tired of paying taxes, not getting luxurious gifts or free house cleaning by my many followers as I'm 'too busy preachin' tha word' to do it myself or have some eye-candy tart I hooked up with risk breaking her manicured nails doing it instead.\n I'm tired of being afraid of rabies.\n \n I'm gonna be a preacha and I call all those out there who have lost their way to repent of their wickedness and return to the fold and follow the 'one true way'. \n For starters, I'd like to take a love offering and you all can PM me for my paypal acct info. I need it muchly to start my evangelical works.\n \n emoticon_xangel",
