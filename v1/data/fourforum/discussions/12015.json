   "I believe the 'free' press has failed the American people in the last several years. Nowhere was that more apparent than in the last election. I'd like to hear from people on BOTH sides about this. \n \n Do you agree that there IS a bias and what are your feelings on the press and their responsibility in a Democracy?\n \n Can the press regain the trust of those who've lost faith?\n \n Can the 'alternative' media balance out the tendencies of the MSM?\n \n \n \n \n (see also a second article link on the bottom...)\n 'Disgusting' Bias for Obama, Time Writer Admits \n \n Sunday, November 23, 2008 5:40 PM\n \n Article Font Size \n \n \n \n The mainstream media's support for Barack Obama's presidential campaign was so biased that even major insiders are now admitting they were shocked by its depth and depravity. \n \n \n Last week, Time magazine's Mark Halperin called the media's performance during the campaign simply \"disgusting.\" \n \n \n Halperin told a panel of media analysts at the Politico/USC conference on the 2008 election, \"It's the most disgusting failure of people in our business since the Iraq war.\" \n \n \n He added, \"It was extreme bias, extreme pro-Obama coverage.\" \n \n \n According to the Web site Politico, Halperin, who edits Time's political site \"The Page,\" zeroed in on two New York Times articles near the end of the campaign that profiled both Cindy McCain and Michelle Obama. \n \n \n \"The story about Cindy McCain was vicious,\" Halperin said. \"It looked for every negative thing they could find about her and it cast her in an extraordinarily negative light. It didn't talk about her work, for instance, as a mother for her children, and they cherry-picked every negative thing that's ever been written about her.\" \n \n \n But the Times gave Michelle Obama red carpet treatment, \"like a front-page endorsement of what a great person Michelle Obama is.\" \n \n \n Halperin, a former ABC News political director, allowed that some of the press coverage simply reflected the extreme efficiency of Obama's presidential campaign. \n \n \n \"You do have to take into account the fact that this was a remarkable candidacy,\" Halperin said. \"There were a lot of good stories. He was new.\" \n \n \n Obama also had a lot of money and outspent Republican John McCain by more than 2 to 1. \n \n \n The press never bothered to hold Obama accountable for reneging on his promise to use public financing. McCain kept his promise to do so. \n \n \n During the campaign, conservatives criticized the pro-Obama coverage, but it had little effect. \n \n \n Columnist David Limbaugh noted: \"Never has that been clearer than in the 2008 presidential election, during which they are covering up rather than covering Barack Obama's shady past and alliances, his knee-deep involvement in corrupt practices threatening the very core of our democratic system, and his many policy misrepresentations.\" \n \n \n Limbaugh noted that the press went into a tizzy over Sarah Palin's wardrobe, but ignored extravagances like Obama's \"obscenely idolatrous million-dollar Greek coliseum mirage.\" \n \n \n Now that the election is over, Halperin is not alone in admitting the bias. The Washington Post's ombudsman recently conceded that the paper's coverage was skewed strongly in favor of Obama and against the McCain-Palin ticket. \n \n [Editor's Note: See \"Washington Post Admits Bias for Obama, Against McCain, Palin.\"] Newsmax.com - Washington Post Admits Bias for Obama, Against McCain, Palin\n \n \n \n \u00a9 2008 Newsmax.

The fairness doctrine is the lefts attempt to equal the playing field in the market place of ideas when all of the factual, real time evidence shows that liberals can't pay to hold on to an audience.\n \n But journalists have a very specific code of ethics which is not worth the paper it is written on regarding how the liberal main stream media reports today. And Tom Brokaw proved that by admitting that post election, he still didn't know what Obama believes, knows about important issues of foreign policy, or believes as a personal code of ethics or morality, even though he personally interviewed him. That is a betrayal of his journalistic integrity and relegates him to nothing more than a tabloid reporter who will tell any story as long as it accomplishes ratings and personal points for his career, and worse yet, forwards his personal political ideology. Here is the journalists code of ethics: \n Preamble\n Members of the Society of Professional Journalists believe that public enlightenment is the forerunner of justice and the foundation of democracy. The duty of the journalist is to further those ends by seeking truth and providing a fair and comprehensive account of events and issues. Conscientious journalists from all media and specialties strive to serve the public with thoroughness and honesty. Professional integrity is the cornerstone of a journalist's credibility. Members of the Society share a dedication to ethical behavior and adopt this code to declare the Society's principles and standards of practice.\n \n \n Seek Truth and Report It\n Journalists should be honest, fair and courageous in gathering, reporting and interpreting information.\n \n Journalists should:\n \n - Test the accuracy of information from all sources and exercise care to avoid inadvertent error. Deliberate distortion is never permissible.\n - Diligently seek out subjects of news stories to give them the opportunity to respond to allegations of wrongdoing.\n - Identify sources whenever feasible. The public is entitled to as much information as possible on sources' reliability.\n - Always question sources' motives before promising anonymity. Clarify conditions attached to any promise made in exchange for information. Keep promises.\n - Make certain that headlines, news teases and promotional material, photos, video, audio, graphics, sound bites and quotations do not misrepresent. They should not oversimplify or highlight incidents out of context.\n - Never distort the content of news photos or video. Image enhancement for technical clarity is always permissible. Label montages and photo illustrations.\n - Avoid misleading re-enactments or staged news events. If re-enactment is necessary to tell a story, label it.\n - Avoid undercover or other surreptitious methods of gathering information except when traditional open methods will not yield information vital to the public. Use of such methods should be explained as part of the story\n - Never plagiarize.\n - Tell the story of the diversity and magnitude of the human experience boldly, even when it is unpopular to do so.\n - Examine their own cultural values and avoid imposing those values on others.\n - Avoid stereotyping by race, gender, age, religion, ethnicity, geography, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance or social status.\n - Support the open exchange of views, even views they find repugnant.\n - Give voice to the voiceless; official and unofficial sources of information can be equally valid.\n - Distinguish between advocacy and news reporting. Analysis and commentary should be labeled and not misrepresent fact or context.\n - Distinguish news from advertising and shun hybrids that blur the lines between the two.\n - Recognize a special obligation to ensure that the public's business is conducted in the open and that government records are open to inspection.\n \n \n Minimize Harm\n Ethical journalists treat sources, subjects and colleagues as human beings deserving of respect.\n \n Journalists should:\n \n - Show compassion for those who may be affected adversely by news coverage. Use special sensitivity when dealing with children and inexperienced sources or subjects.\n - Be sensitive when seeking or using interviews or photographs of those affected by tragedy or grief.\n - Recognize that gathering and reporting information may cause harm or discomfort. Pursuit of the news is not a license for arrogance.\n - Recognize that private people have a greater right to control information about themselves than do public officials and others who seek power, influence or attention. Only an overriding public need can justify intrusion into anyone's privacy.\n - Show good taste. Avoid pandering to lurid curiosity.\n - Be cautious about identifying juvenile suspects or victims of sex crimes.\n - Be judicious about naming criminal suspects before the formal filing of charges.\n - Balance a criminal suspect's fair trial rights with the public's right to be informed.\n \n \n Act Independently\n Journalists should be free of obligation to any interest other than the public's right to know.\n \n Journalists should:\n \n -Avoid conflicts of interest, real or perceived.\n - Remain free of associations and activities that may compromise integrity or damage credibility.\n - Refuse gifts, favors, fees, free travel and special treatment, and shun secondary employment, political involvement, public office and service in community organizations if they compromise journalistic integrity.\n - Disclose unavoidable conflicts.\n - Be vigilant and courageous about holding those with power accountable.\n - Deny favored treatment to advertisers and special interests and resist their pressure to influence news coverage.\n - Be wary of sources offering information for favors or money; avoid bidding for news. \n \n \n Be Accountable\n Journalists are accountable to their readers, listeners, viewers and each other.\n \n Journalists should:\n \n - Clarify and explain news coverage and invite dialogue with the public over journalistic conduct.\n - Encourage the public to voice grievances against the news media.\n - Admit mistakes and correct them promptly.\n - Expose unethical practices of journalists and the news media.\n - Abide by the same high standards to which they hold others.\n \n \n The SPJ Code of Ethics is voluntarily embraced by thousands of\n writers, editors and other news professionals. The present version of\n the code was adopted by the 1996 SPJ National Convention, after months\n of study and debate among the Society's members.\n \n Sigma Delta Chi's first Code of Ethics was borrowed from the\n American Society of Newspaper Editors in 1926. In 1973, Sigma Delta Chi\n wrote its own code, which was revised in 1984, 1987 and 1996.Redirecting...",
