As some others point out here, when you register to purchase a gun at a licensed dealer, the only information that the federal government recieves is the stuff for your background check, which must be destroyed.\n \n What these folks DONT realise, is that all firearms transfers made by licensed dealers are required bt BATF regulation to be recorded in the dealer \"bound book\" of firearm transfers. Federal law says they are required to keep these books forever, or if they fail to renew their FFL, they are required to send the bound book to the ATF. Also by federal law, they are required to make that bound book available to the ATF at any time, without a warrant, in order to facilitate the tracing of firearms. \n \n A nationwide datebase of firearm owners is already HERE. It is just fragmented into a bunch of smaller parts and kept by gun dealers instead of in a central database. All it would take is a trip o each gun stor, and they would have a list of everybody who has bought a gun from a licensed dealer.\n \n As far as police tracking black market guns, it doesn't seem to work now, and I fai to see how they are going to do any better at it int he future. YOu are talking about something that can only really be detected by direct examination. A crate full of guns and a crate full of drill bits looks the same to an X ray. Guns don;t have a specific odor that dogs can be trained to detect.\n \n \nIn addition you would have to make possesion of a firearm illegal, then you have to balance defending your property with revealing you are commiting a crime (will be fairly obvious if you use one and you would have to get rid of it anyway when forensics investigate the crime scene). Would also have to look at countries that have carried out sucessful ones to see if there are any little points or mistakes to pick up.\n\n \n The first problem would be finding a country where there has been a sucessful gun ban. As far as I know, every country on the planet experiences some violence related gun use, even the ones with draconian gun control laws. Even in te Soviet Union, where posession of illegal firearms could potentially lead to a death sentence, there was still shootings.\n \n \n \nIf there is a lot of resistance you could make possesion of a gun attempted murder, would make people think very carefully whether they would want to carry them, especailly criminals- comunity service or light sentace for a mugging or long term prison sentance for attempted murder if they are carrying a gun while doing it, even in bank robbery they would likely think twice about the additional years.\n\n \n I think you are right on this one. People would reconsider when they are looking at that kind of penalty. I take the opposite view as you , thoug, I think this would simply encourage them to carry bigger, badder guns. If you are looking at life for robbing a bank, you may as well use a rocket launcher and an M-60 as use a handgun. This would virtually ensure that the police would not get you, as most police departments on the planet are not equipped to deal with heavy machine guns and rocket launchers. If hte penalty is the same though, why not?\n \n People tend to miss the most obvious (and most dangerous) way to institute gun control That is to restrict the sale and manufacture of bullets. Without bullets, your gun is nothing but a paper weight. Bullets are also much more difficult to produce than guns. While they can be reloaded, casings are incredibly difficult to make on a small scale. The only way to really do it is to turn them down one at a time on a lathe. Dogs CAN be used to sniff out gunpowder and primers.\n \n This is a danger I think people miss when they start bannign certain types of ammunition. Right now, \"cop killer\" ammo is outlawed in the united states. Gun advocates laughed our butts off when they did this, since the \"cop killer\" amunition as they described it does not exist ouside of hollywood (NO, coating a bullet with teflon will not enable it to pierce body armor, it will lubricate your barrel when you shoot it, though).

   "So what is wrong with a total ammunition ban then, in addition to the gun ban as dogs could sniff out the ammunition being shipped in and the un shop records provide you witha lsit of gun owners. When you say dangerous do you mean to the right to bear arms or to people in general.\n \n As for the bigger and badder weapons dont' think it is really an issue, rocket launchers are going to be hard enough to find and are illegal anyway and the larger assault weapons are not really as convient as a smaller one. Sure if someone actually wanted to kill a whole load of people they would get one of these, but nothing stops them doing this anyway. However for intimidation purposes there is no need to have the most powerful weapon availible, more liekly you would see the trend toward smaller and smaller weapons that are more easy to conceal, in any case you still wouldn't want to use it as there is quite a signisificant difference between attmepted murder and actual murder isn't there?",

If you do not have a ffl you are in violation of the law.\n\n \n First off, there is no \"certain number of guns\" that makes you a gun dealer.

The term \"licensed dealer\" means any dealer who is licensed under the provisions of this chapter &#91;18 USCS Sec.Sec.921 et seq&#93;.\n\n \n Here is the definition of \"engaged in business\"from the same act:\n \n \n(C) as applied to a dealer in firearms, as defined in section 921(a)(11)(A), a person who devotes time, attention, and labor to dealing in firearms as a regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit through the repetitive purchase and resale of firearms, but such term shall not include a person who makes occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby, or who sells all or part of his personal collection of firearms;\n\n \n \n(22) The term \"with the principal objective of livelihood and profit\" means that the intent underlying the sale or disposition of firearms is predominantly one of obtaining livelihood and pecuniary gain, as opposed to other intents, such as improving or liquidating a personal firearms collection: Provided, That proof of profit shall not be required as to a person who engages in the regular and repetitive purchase and disposition of firearms for criminal purposes or terrorism.

The test for whether you are a gun dealer or not is set forth by the gun control act of 1968:\n \n (\n \n Here is the definition of \"engaged in business\"from the same act:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n I have a fairly large personal collection. As a policy, I prefer not to sell firearms at all, I prefer that they be in my collection. Sometimes you have to clear some room, though, or the gun you thought would be a great addition ot your collection seems a less great addition than the NEW great addition to your collection.\n \n I can say with entire honesty that I do not, nor have I ever, made a profit dealing in firearms, and I most definatly am not a person who \"engages in the regular and repetitive purchase and disposition of firearms for criminal purposes or terrorism\".\n \n There is a popular myth that if you sell more than 2 guns per year you are a \"dealer\" and need a license. That is exactly what it is, a myth.\n\n \n \n All we need to do is contact the ATF and ask them.",

Why use snail mail when at this web site http://www.atf.gov/ they give their e-mail address to send inquiries to.\n \n \nThe problem is the \"evidence of resale\". Private owners in the US are not required to keep sales records. I have sold dozens of guns, mabe hundreds of guns, for cash in hand. If I was called upon tommorow to provide prof of sale for those weapons, I would be in real trouble. With he burden of proof being on the government, it would simply be a matter of a couple hundred million people saying \"sorry, I sold it\".\n \n I would think that one fell swoop would be a better idea if your goal was disarmamament. As soon as people figured out what was going on, there are enough pro-ginners out there that you would have an armed rebellion on your hands in no time at all. The right to bear arms in America is comparable to many with the right to breathe the air. It is a right we have always enoyed, and to take away that right is to many the very definition of tyranny. tastyfish, check your PM\n\n \n No where in your post do you identify yourself as a FFL holder with an SOT or an employee of one.",

   "[QUOTE=JustAnotherGuy]Class III manufacturing license? Why use snail mail when at this web site http://www.atf.gov/ they give their e-mail address to send inquiries to.\n \n \n Sorry, typo/lost track of where I was in the sentence. Class II is a manufacturers licence, class III is dealer. Of course, the \"class\" is just for SOT purposed (special occupational tax). \n \n I have never had any luck getting answers to legal questions from the ATF via E-mail. I have always gotten a reply back that says something like \"we can't answer legal questions unless they are submitted in writing\" then they give the address I posted before. You can try it, though. \n \n I have been audited by the ATF more than once, and pains were taken to ensure that I hadn't mixed \"business\" guns into my personal collection or vice versa. \n \n I do keep kind of a log of what guns I have bought and sold in my personal collection, but that is more for personal convenience that to be able to prove my non-dealer status.\n \n I went to an estate sale the other day where they had nearly a hundred guns for sale. By the \"Certain number of guns makes you a dealer\" logic, tehy would have needed an FFL to carry out the estate sale.",

   "Once you have the list then you can issue all the gun owners a 'recall order', give them a certain amount of time (6 months or so) before the stricter enforcement is instigated and if they fail to give in their guns to a police station in that time (or evidence of resale), then fine them.\n There is presumably some department of the FBI or Police who deal with importing and illegal weapons already, would make sense just to enlarge these departments. It will cost money, quite a bit (though it seems Canada had a few other planning problems which pushed the budget to such high levels) but all these kinds of laws that affect a lot of people do). Trick is to do it in stages rather than in one fell swoop I think.\n\n \n \n Lets say less than 1% of gun owners \"revolt\" thats still over 100,000 citizens fighting back.

   "Media is most improtant factor, but that would be primarily decided by the popularity of the ban. Pro-gunner are easier to demonise and the media tneds to side more toward the left normally.\n\n \n Which is why the whole gun ban scenario is pretty unlikely to begin with. Less than 20% of americans support a full ban. There are polls out there that suggest otherwise, but they have been widely discredited such as the infamous brady campaign poll that asked \"Do you support gun control that keeps guns out of the hands of felons and terrorists?\". Of course, only an idiot would say no. When they posted the reults of the poll they claimed that 80% of Americans had said that they support strict gun control laws. \n \n Even on most of the forums on the internet, you find that there are a few folks who want a gun ban, and they are generally swamped by a plethora of pro-gunners. While it is true that it is easier to demonise in the media, numbers don't lie. It is generally accepted that allowing americans to own guns is a deterent to crime. This is why 36 states now have concealed carry provisions. Kansas is expected to pass concealed carry this year, and at one time the gov promised she would veto it. A poll published last week in the emporia gazette shows that 90% of people polled said she would NOT win re-election if she actually does veto the measure.",
