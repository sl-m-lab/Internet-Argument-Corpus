   "From here: Gaza relief boat damaged in encounter with Israeli vessel - CNN.com\n \n \n An Israeli patrol boat struck a boat carrying medical volunteers and supplies to Gaza early Tuesday as it attempted to intercept the vessel in the Mediterranean Sea, witnesses and Israeli officials said.\n \n CNN correspondent Karl Penhaul was aboard the 60-foot pleasure boat Dignity when the contact occurred. When the boat later docked in the Lebanese port city of Tyre, severe damage was visible to the forward port side of the boat, and the front left window and part of the roof had collapsed. It was flying the flag of Gibralter.\n \n The Dignity was carrying crew and 16 passengers -- physicians from Britain, Germany and Cyprus and human rights activists, including former U.S. Rep. Cynthia McKinney -- who were trying to reach Gaza through an Israeli blockade of the territory. \n \n The captain of the Dignity said the Israelis broadcast a radio message accusing the vessel of being involved in terrorist activity. \n \n \n\n \n and:\n \nPenhaul said at least two Israeli patrol boats had shadowed the Dignity for about half an hour before the collision, moving around the vessel on all sides. One of the patrol boats then shined its spotlight on the Dignity while the other, with its lights off, \"very severely rammed\" the boat. \n \n The captain of the Dignity told Penhaul he received no warning. Only after the collision did the Israelis come on the radio to say they struck the boat because they believed it was involved in terrorist activities. \n \n The captain and crew said their vessel was struck intentionally, Penhaul said, but Palmor called those allegations \"absurd.\" \n \n \"There is no intention on the part of the Israeli navy to ram anybody,\" Palmor said. \n \n \"I would call it ramming. Let's just call it as it is,\" McKinney said after the boat docked in Lebanon. \"Our boat was rammed three times, twice in the front and one on the side. Watch Cynthia McKinney discuss the collision >>\n \n \"Our mission was a peaceful mission to deliver medical supplies and our mission was thwarted by the Israelis -- the aggressiveness of the Israeli military,\" she said.\n \n The incident occurred in international waters about 90 miles off Gaza. Israel controls the waters off Gaza's coast and routinely blocks ships from coming into the Palestinian territory as part of an ongoing blockade that also applies to the Israel-Gaza border. Human rights groups have expressed concern about the blockade on Gaza, which has restricted the delivery of emergency aid and fuel supplies. \n \n Tuesday's collision was so severe, Penhaul said, that the passengers were ordered to put on their life vests and be ready to get in lifeboats. The Dignity began taking on water, but the crew managed to pump it out of the hull long enough for the boat to reach shore. \n \n \"It could have ended with people drowning if they hit us more square on,\" Dignity's captain, Denis Healey, said. \"It could have gone down in minutes.\" \n \n\n Why am I not suprised, what with Israel's most recent manhood fencing contest in Gaza in which they flourish their military power through excessive force murdering Palestinian civilians?\n \n Don't mistake me. Hamas should stop launching rockets, and I do not support those actions they've been conducting. But Israel's \"response\" is absolutely ridiculous.\n \n As to this incident, absolutely disgusting once again on the part of the Israelis. C'mon, attacking AID workers? Doctors headed in to help the people murdered and injured by Israel's actions? Disgusting.",

   "When did the USA invade Mexico, killing thousands of the inhabitants?\n\n \n You're kidding right? Have you heard of the Mexican-American War when we took Texas, New Mexico and California by force? \n \n Mexican?American War - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n The Mexican&#8211;American War was an armed conflict between the United States and Mexico from 1846 to 1848 in the wake of the 1845 U.S. annexation of Texas. Mexico claimed ownership of Texas as a breakaway province and refused to recognize the secession and subsequent military victory by Texas in 1836.\n In the U.S. the conflict is often referred to simply as the Mexican War and infrequently as the U.S.&#8211;Mexican War. In Mexico, terms for it include Intervenci\u00f3n Norteamericana en M\u00e9xico (North American intervention in Mexico), Invasi\u00f3n Estadounidense de M\u00e9xico (American[a] Invasion of Mexico), and Guerra del 47 (The War of '47).\n The most important consequences of the war for the United States were the Mexican terms of surrender under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, in which the Mexican territories of Alta California and Santa F\u00e9 de Nuevo M\u00e9xico were ceded to the United States. In Mexico, the enormous loss of territory following the war encouraged its government to enact policies to colonize its remaining northern territories as a hedge against further losses. In addition the Rio Grande became the boundary between Texas and Mexico, and Mexico never again claimed ownership of Texas.\n There are mexican groups which are still bitter about the USA annexing so much of what was once Mexican land. Beside, I gave an example for the sake of argument. Even if it wasn't factual and just a pure hypothetical, would it be worthy of arguing over? Must you always focus on the side issues of the point I'm making in order to oppose me at every turn? Especially since it usually reveals your ignorance of actual events?\n \n Here, educate yourself regarding the existence of modern day mexican separatists, What is Aztlan, Raza, and MEChA And what their agenda is.\n \n Now, back on topic. Here is the sequence of events going back to may of 1948 and how Israel attempted peace but was rebuffed at every turn by the Palestinians and Arab States which surrounded Israel. \n The Palestinian Refugees\n \n Now, only one day after Israel declared its independence, it was invaded by 5 neighboring Arab Nations. How can anyone claim that a brand new, almost completely defenseless country be the aggressor under such circumstances. Especially since this was only the first of many unified invasions Israel would face over the next 20 years?\n (May 15, 1948)\n \n On May 15, 1948, the day the British Mandate over Palestine ended, the armies of five neighboring Arab states invaded the new State of Israel, which had declared its independence the previous day. The invasion, heralded by an Egyptian air attack on Tel Aviv, was vigorously resisted. From the north, east and south came the armies of Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Transjordan, and Egypt.\n \n The invading forces were fully equipped with the standard weapons of a regular army of the time - artillery, tanks, armored cars and personnel carriers, in addition to machine guns, mortars and the usual small arms in great quantities, and full supplies of ammunition, oil, and gasoline. Further, Egypt, Iraq, and Syria had air forces. As sovereign states, they had no difficulty (as had the pre-state Jewish defense force) in securing whatever armaments they needed through normal channels from Britain and other friendly powers.\n \n In contrast, the Jews had no matching artillery, no tanks, and no warplanes in the first days of the war. Some supplies of these weapons arrived in the days that followed, however, and turned the tide. Little more than small arms - in paucity- had been available to the Haganah which on May 28, 1948, was to merge with other Jewish defense groups to form the Israel Defense Forces. Two Jewish defense forces, the Irgun Zeva'i Le'ummi and the Lohamei Herut Israel agreed to cease their independent activities, (except in Jerusalem) and to absorb their members into the newly founded IDF.\n \n Invaded from all directions, Israel had to cope with the outbreak of a thousand fires, and to do so with limited means. Numerous settlement outposts in the Galilee and the Negev were isolated, open on all sides to Arab attack, and had to rely on their own perseverance and meager armories to stave off defeat. The hastily mobilized army had to engage in offensive action to remove the enemy from key positions, block the advance of their columns, and rush to seal gaps in Israel's defenses.Arab Armies Invade",

And why have no defenders of Hamas responded to them firing their rockets from densely populated civilian neighborhoods? How can Israel be blamed for killing civilians when it's Hamas who brings the shooting war to those population centers?\n \n And since everyone completely ignored this link the first time I posted it, let's try again. It's a story from 2000 that shows how Palestinians will use and sacrifice their own children for propaganda purposes. So what's happening in Gaza or with this boat is nothing new for these animals you are defending. Here's an excerpt:\n According to the Palestinians, over 40 children have been killed in the waves of violence and confrontations that began at the end of September. They have been killed in the front lines, providing cover for the armed Palestinian militias with machine guns and other weapons seeking to overwhelm isolated Israeli guard posts. The outnumbered Israeli soldiers, defending the civilians behind these outposts, cannot see the children through the small slits and openings (as was clearly the case at the Netzarim crossing in Gaza). The tragic images of these young victims provide first-rate propaganda to use against Israel.\n \n Interviewed by journalists after these tragedies, some parents of these young victims refer to their children as \"shaheeds\" (martyrs), whose lives were given willingly and proudly to the Palestinian cause in fighting the hated Zionist enemy. In a scene that was unbelievably shocking, one mother boasted that she bore her son precisely for this purpose, and the father proudly claimed credit for providing the training.

Have you no sense of fair play or justice at all? Israel didn't place those offensive weapon systems in Palestinian neighborhoods, Hamas did. When will you start to hold Hamas responsible for sacrificing their own citizens for the sake of political propaganda?\n \n \nSo how can caring ,well educated , middle class people justify the actions of these monsters?\n\n \n Don't ask me gansao, I will never understand the blindness and distorted sense of justice which drives these people.

Nothing can be considered more despicable in my opinion.\n \n \nIn this instance apologists for war crimes committed by the Israelis are prepared to sanction any atrocity, regardless of how many people are killed, so long as it continues the oppression of the Palestinian peope and the occupation and/or blockade of the Palestinian territories.

And how can you say that the thousands of rockets hamas has fired at Israeli neighborhoods over the last few years doesn't fall under the heading of atrocities and war crimes which deserve to be answered with an overwhelming response?\n \n \nI would be interested to hear from Israel apologists how they think the Palestinians should respond to the murder of thousands of Palestinians by the occupying forces.\n\n \n This question is so distorted and prejudicial it doesn't deserve an answer. You see Jo, the Israeli's aren't an occupying force at all. They are the legal inhabitants of that land according to the United Nations resolution.\n On November 29, 1947, the United Nations voted to divide Palestine so that a Jewish national homeland could be created from one of its parts. As Abba Eban observes, \"No sooner had the partition resolution been adopted than attempts were made to thwart it.\" The surrounding Arab states threatened to make war on any Jewish political entity. The British, who had administered Palestine before partition, took a hands-off policy toward Arab attacks on Jewish settlers.\n Now that that issue is settled, I'll answer your question. The Palestinian authority should have taken the 5 BILLION DOLLARS or so that Yassar Arafat had squirreled away in Banks all over the world. Money which he collected over 30 years from numerous governments but never used to build any type of palestinian infrastructure in order to employ, feed, or house his people. Had the palestinians built banks, factories, schools, gas stations, businesses and roads, the people would have been productive and happy to live side by side with Israel. He did use some of that money to fund terrorism though.\n \n And Israel would have been happy and good neighbors as they watched them prosper in peace and security. Here's the rub though. Happy and contented people don't like to fight and hate their neighbors, so Arafat kept the money for himself and kept the people hungry, poor and oppressed. And they blamed the Jews for all of their social problems because angry people will hate and fight their perceived enemies. That is the crux of this never ending animosity Jo. It's the radicals doing everything they can to foment hatred and violence and the tool they used was hunger and starvation for their own people as they kept them in abject poverty for so many decades. Here's some evidence for you to chew on, if you can stomach it.\n Fears Arafat millions could quietly vanish\n November 10, 2004\n \n A Palestinian Authority picture of Yasser Arafat with doctors at his compound in Ramallah on Thursday.\n Photo: AP\n In his four decades as Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat has run a murky financial empire that includes far-flung Palestine Liberation Organisation investments in airlines, banana plantations and high-tech companies, and money hidden around the world.\n \n Jaweed al-Ghussein, a former PLO finance minister, said the empire was worth up to $US5 billion ($6.6 billion at present rates) when he quit in 1996.\n \n No one will say how much it is worth now, though some estimates say it is only a few million. But as the 75-year-old Mr Arafat fights for his life in a hospital near Paris, Palestinians fear that what is left will disappear or be pocketed by the President's cronies.\n \n \"It's the money of the Palestinian people,\" said Hassan Khreishe, a Palestinian MP, adding he would urge a parliamentary investigation. That could prove difficult.\n \n Mr Arafat has long resisted proper accounting for the funds, which include Arab payments to the PLO in the 1970s and 1980s, and Western aid to his self-rule government, the Palestinian Authority, after interim peace deals with Israel in the 1990s.\n \n Mr Arafat lived frugally, but needed large sums to maintain loyalties. He would register investments and bank accounts in the names of loyalists, to buy their support and protect the holdings from scrutiny and seizure, Mr Ghussein said.\n \n Only Mr Arafat had the full picture, he said, and it is not clear whether he has completed a will or financial records.\n \n Mohammed Rashid, Mr Arafat's financial adviser, denied his boss was rich. \"Arafat has no personal property in any part in the world,\" he told Al Arabiya television on Monday. \"He doesn't even have a tent, a house, an orchard or any account that we can call personal in the name of Yasser Arafat.\"\n \n However, Forbes magazine ranked him No. 6 on its 2003 list of the richest \"kings, queens and despots\", estimating he was worth at least $US300 million.\n \n Shalom Harari, a former top Israeli intelligence official, said Mr Arafat may have stashed away up to $US700 million, part of it for an emergency such as a new exile.\n \n Two names frequently come up in connection with Mr Arafat's money - Mr Rashid and the President's wife, Suha.\n \n In the past 10 years, Mr Rashid has handled hundreds of millions of dollars in Palestinian Authority revenue Mr Arafat diverted from the treasury - though the reformist Finance Minister, Salam Fayyad, has said the money has since been restored to public control.\n \n Suha Arafat, Mr Arafat's wife of 13 years and mother of his daughter, lives in Paris and has received payments of $US100,000 a month from the Palestinian coffers, a senior official in Mr Arafat's office said. This year, French prosecutors began a money-laundering inquiry into transfers of $US11.4 million into her accounts.\n \n Mr Ghussein said the big money from the Arab world started flowing in 1979. For a decade, the PLO received about $US200 million a year, $US85 million of it from Saudi Arabia.\n \n Much of the Arab money dried up after Mr Arafat infuriated his patrons in 1990 by siding with Saddam Hussein during Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, though Saddam gave Mr Arafat $US150 million, Mr Ghussein said.\n \n The PLO investments are said to have ranged from an airline in the Maldives to a Greek shipping company, banana plantations, a diamond mine in Africa and real estate throughout the Arab world.\n \n Many countries supportive of the fledgling peace effort with Israel donated more than $US6.5 billion to the Palestinian Authority between 1994 and 2003, often asking few questions.\n \n Last year the International Monetary Fund reported $US900 million in Palestinian Authority income never reached the treasury during the first six years of self-rule. Instead, the money went into a Tel Aviv account controlled by Mr Arafat.\n \n International aid officials declined to discuss PLO finances, saying they were concerned only with the Palestinian Authority's bookkeeping.\n \n Karim Nashashibi, the International Monetary Fund representative in the Palestinian areas, said the $US900 million has been restored to the treasury under Mr Fayyad, who has won international praise for his work.\n \n Associated PressFears Arafat millions could quietly vanish - Middle East Conflict - www.smh.com.au\n \n Just imagine if that money which came in annually since the 70s had been spent on building a peaceful Palestinian State rather than hording it for himself and the PLO while holding the people in bondage to hate and hunger as they blamed Israel for their suffering? This issue would not exist today. But a people must want peace in order to make it happen, and neither the PLO, hamas, hezballah or militant islam wants that so they use whatever tactics they can dream up to foment hatred and anger toward Israel and the Jew. I know this answers your question more fully than you hoped for, but maybe some reality will wake you up as to who the real war criminals are, and as to who is committing the real atrocities which keep this problem alive. And maybe some of the newbies will appreciate this criticism of the arabs more knowing its coming from an arab who actually has family in the middle east.",

And you act like it is only Israel whom the Palestinians haven't been able to get along with. When in fact, the Palestinians have been expelled from every Arab Country they have ever attempted to live within because of the political unrest they brought with them. Here's my post responding to penfolds denial of history which also deals with what Israel had to deal with from its very inception; having been attacked literally ONE DAY after declaring its independence. http://www.4forums.com/political/current-events-debates/12163-israel-now-attacking-relief-workers-headed-gaza.html#post338371\n Why did Jordan expel the PLO in 1970?\n \n Following the June 1967 Six Day War, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) established its major base of operations for the war against Israel in Jordan. Throughout the late 1960s, a cycle of Palestinian guerrilla attacks followed by Israeli retaliatory raids against Jordan caused much damage to Jordan and put major strain on Jordan's relationship with the US and other Western countries. By 1970, it was widely believed that PLO leader Yasser Arafat and other factional heads were attempting to overthrow King Hussein, who viewed their operations against Israel as a threat to Jordan.\n \n By 1970, Palestinians, both Jordanian citizens and refugees, were almost as numerous in Jordan as King Hussein's own Bedouins. Arafat used the estimated 20,000 Palestine Liberation Organization fighters in Jordan to exercise control over much of the Palestinian population. In many parts of the country, he was the de facto government. Jordan was seen as a waystation toward defeat of Israel and a united Palestinian Arab state encompassing Israel and Jordan. As many Palestinian Arabs put it: \"the road to Tel Aviv lies through Amman\".\n \n On September 6, 1970 militant factions of the PLO hijacked four foreign planes. They flew three to Dawson's Field in PLO-controlled northern Jordan and one to Cairo. European governments secured the release of the hostage passangers by agreeing to release PLO terrorists from their prisons. The PLO then blew up the planes.\n \n King Hussein decided it was time to act. Throughout September the Jordanian military launched attacks to push the PLO out of Jordan, attacks now called \"Black September\" by the PLO. Casualty reports are uncertain, but hundreds or perhaps thousands of PLO fadayeen were killed in the fighting and large numbers of Palestinian Arab civilians died as well. Arafat retreated to northern Jordan, close to his Syrian sponsors. Within 10 months the PLO were driven out of Jordan completely, and re-established themselves in Lebanon, a choice that led to eventual disaster for Lebanon.\n \n Jordan's attack on the PLO led to an escalation of Syrian-Israeli tensions. The wider Arab world, which had long distrusted Hussein as a Western puppet, sided with the PLO. Syria sent tanks into Jordan -- and the king was powerless to stop their steady advance. After Hussein sought American intervention, four Israeli Phantom jets flew low over the Syrian tanks. Without a shot being fired, the tanks turned north and headed back toward Damascus. Israeli troops were also deployed along the Jordan River. These actions were seen in Washington as having deterred a large-scale Syrian invasion of Jordan. As a result, US President Richard M. Nixon increasingly viewed Israel as an important strategic asset, and the Rogers Plan was allowed to die.Jordan Expels the PLO in 1970\n \n And here are excerpts that give a more detailed history of how Palestinians dealt with their arab neighbors and how they were rebuffed and expelled by them. The question is, why doesn't Israel have the same rights to expel a people who refuse to live side by side with them in peace?\n Black September, The PLO's attempt to take over Jordan in 1970\n \n The nature of the Arab purpose in Palestine was illumined, was indeed dramatised, by the clash between the terrorist organisations and the Jordanian government that began September 1970. Not an ideological confrontation nor the result of a difference of opinion on the proper fate of Israel, the clash between them was over power and authority. What the Fatah demanded was, in fact, a sharing of power and authority in Jordan. The smaller, so-called left-wing organisations led by George Habash and Naif Huwatma called for a complete change of regime -- that is, for Palestinian control in Jordan. In those parts of Jordan which adjoined the border with Israel, they demanded complete autonomy; throughout the rest of the country, they demanded a measure of exemption from the laws of the land for the members of their organisations. Hussein and his ministers were prepared to go-indeed, they did go-a long way to meet these demands. The conflict came over the extent of agreement. In the heat of the battle, the Palestinians involuntarily abandoned the posture to which their propaganda had for years accustomed the world. Exposed suddenly was the cynical imposture of the plea of homelessness by which hearts in so many countries had been touched.\n \n The encounter in Jordan uncovered only a small part of the not at all secret fact of the Arabs' territorial affinities. It was even more rudely exposed in the confrontation in the Lebanese republic. Though- the Arabs do not claim Lebanon as a part of Palestine, in Lebanon the Fatah troops behaved exactly as they had behaved in Jordan. Throughout the country, dotted with their information and recruiting offices, they assumed the right of exemption from the ordinary civic regulations and restraints of the constituted Lebanese authority. They took over refugee camps, turned them into bases, and set up checkposts on the highways. In the southern zone, bordering on Israel, they demanded and seized autonomous control. Their rule was so comprehensive that some newspaper correspondents promptly labelled the area Fatahland. It was from here that they fired their mortars across the border into Israel&#8217;s northernmost villages.\n \n For many months Lebanon, divided into two camps, was in a state of perpetual crisis that almost completely paralysed its government. The Lebanese (even the lukewarm Christians) were prepared to, and did, go far to meet the Fatah demands. But even the fervent Moslem supporters of the Fatah declined to overstep the limits beyond which lay anarchy. In the end, an uneasy compromise was worked out. In the south it was, indeed, enforced willy-nilly by the regular daily appearance of Israeli Army patrols, whom the terrorists on the whole left severely alone. Under this protection, the Arab villagers who had earlier fled now came back and resumed their ordered life. \n \n King Hussein's first attempt to reestablish his authority was made in November 1968. He reached a seven-point agreement with the Palestinian organizations: Members of these organizations were forbidden to walk around the cities armed and in uniform; they were forbidden to stop civilian vehicles in order to conduct searches; they were forbidden to recruit young men who were fit to serve in the \n Jordanian army; they were required to carry Jordanian identity papers; their vehicles were required to bear Jordanian license plates; crimes committed by members of the Palestinian organizations would be investigated by the Jordanian authorities; and disputes between the Palestinian organizations and the government would be settled by a joint council of representatives of the king and of the PLO.\n \n The agreement reached between the sides did not withstand the test of reality. The Palestinian organizations continued to accumulate power in Jordan, and to do as they pleased in the refugee camps. They even intensified the fighting against Israel. During 1969, they conducted 3,170 operations against Israel from Jordanian territory, without bothering to coordinate them in advance with the Jordanian army. The counterattacks carried out by Israel damaged the Jordanian economy, and forced about 70,000 Jordanian subjects to flee from their homes in the Jordan Valley.\n \n In the spring of 1969, the United States began its efforts to promote a political agreement between Israel and the Arab states. King Hussein hoped that president Richard Nixon's Republican administration would be less friendly toward Israel, and would force it to withdraw from the territories it occupied in 1967. He went to Washington to make it clear that Jordan was willing to become more flexible, in order to ensure the success of the American initiative.\n \n The Palestinian organizations anxiously observed his moves. They were afraid of a separate Jordanian-Israeli agreement, which would destroy the dream of a Palestinian state stretching to the Mediterranean Sea.\n \n In order to undermine the political contacts and to bring about a military conflagration between Jordan and Israel, Arafat and his partners stepped up the armed conflict against Israel. Hussein reached the conclusion that he had to act - but his hands were tied. He couldn't do more than Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser allowed him to do. At the beginning of February 1970, Hussein went to Cairo, and received Nasser's secret acquiescence to take more decisive action against the Palestinian organizations.\n \n When the king returned to Jordan on February 10, he published a 10-point edict. Among its provisions were a ban on interference by members of the Palestinian organizations with the activity of the Jordanian security forces, a ban on organization of meetings or assemblies without the permission of the Interior Ministry, and a ban on Palestinian political activity.\n \n The Palestinian organizations were not impressed. On February 11, they established a united military headquarters in order to prepare for a possible Jordanian attack. That same night, 300 people were killed in confrontations that broke out between the two sides in the streets of the capital, Amman. King Hussein was afraid of losing control. Nasser allowed him to impose limitations on the Palestinians, but warned him not to accept an all-out Jordanian war against the Palestinians. Hussein ordered the Jordanian army to refrain from additional activities, and declared: \"We are all fedayeen\" [Palestinian commando groups]. Afterward, he fired his interior minister, who was the greatest enemy of the Palestinian organizations in his government. The first round of battle between the sides ended with a clear victory for Yasser Arafat.\n \n Who gave them rifles?\n \n At the end of July 1970, Egypt decided to accept the plan proposed by U.S. Secretary of State William Rogers, which called for an immediate cease-fire in the war of attrition between Egypt and Israel, and for an Israeli withdrawal from the territories occupied in 1967, in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 242. After Egypt, Jordan also announced that it accepted the plan.\n \n The dramatic decision brought about an intensification of the Palestinian battle against Jordan. The radical left organizations in the PLO, George Habash's Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), Naif Hawatmeh's Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), and Ahmed Jibril's Popular Front- General Command, decided to undermine Hussein's regime in order to ensure the failure of \"the Rogers Plan,\" and perhaps the deposition of the king. In their opinion, the Hashemite regime had to be eliminated in any case, since it was conservative and pro-Western.\n \n Yasser Arafat, head of Fatah, feared that the move to depose Hussein was premature. The Jordanian army numbered 55,000 well-trained soldiers, as well as an armored corps and an air force, whereas the Palestinian organization numbered at most about 15,000 fighters, armed mainly with light weapons. Arafat chose to play both sides against the middle and to maneuver in the ensuing chaos: On the one hand, he didn't stop the radical organizations; on the other, he didn't come out openly against Hussein.\n \n At the beginning of September 1970, the activities of the leftist Palestinian organizations in Jordan turned into open defiance of King Hussein himself. On September 1, a failed attempt on Hussein's life was made while he was on his way to the Amman airport. On September 6, members of the Popular Front hijacked three planes: A Swissair plane and a TWA plane were hijacked to the airport in Zarqa, and an additional plane, belonging to Pan American, was hijacked to the Cairo airport. Three days later, a British plane was hijacked, and \n brought down near Amman. The passengers were held hostage. The hijackers demanded the release of Palestinian prisoners in various countries. A spokesman for the Popular Front said in Beirut that the hijackings were carried out in order \"to teach the Americans a lesson, because of their long-standing support of Israel.\"\n \n Yasser Arafat did not condemn the hijackings, which aroused an international protest against the Palestinians. Hussein knew that the international community would now be more sympathetic toward a decisive battle against the Palestinian organizations, and that Nasser - who wanted to promote the Rogers Plan - would be less supportive. The Jordanian king quickly lost control of his kingdom. \n At the height of the drama of the hijacked planes, the Palestinians declared the area of Irbid in the north of the country a \"liberated region,\" and announced that they were preparing for \"the showdown.\"\n \n But two developments outside Jordan determined the fate of the Palestinian organizations in Jordan. On September 28, Nasser died of a sudden heart attack. He was only 52 years old, and it was said that the tremendous pressure that he had been under because of the events of Black September had brought about his demise. With Nasser's death, the most important protective umbrella of the Palestinians in Jordan disappeared, and Egyptian involvement in the Jordanian-Palestinian conflict waned for the time being. Two months later, the Syrian defense minister, Hafez al-Assad, the leader of the pragmatic branch of the Ba'ath party, seized control in Damascus. So Syria was also not free for the time being to be involved in Palestinian affairs. \n \n The time was ripe for the third and last stage of the continuing war between King Hussein and Yasser Arafat.\n \n Hussein's last battle\n \n After Nasser's death, Arafat understood correctly that his position had been weakened. On October 31, 1970, he signed a five-point agreement, which was similar to that signed in November 1968, and was designed to return control of the country exclusively to King Hussein. The agreement stated that members of the Palestinian organizations were expected to honor Jordanian laws, instructed them to dismantle their bases, and forbade them to walk around armed and \n in uniform in the cities and villages.\n \n Had the Palestinians honored that agreement, Hussein would have had difficulties in continuing to act against them. But the PFLP and the DFLP - the two organizations to the left of Arafat - refused to accept its conditions. They called on their members to ignore the Jordanian government, and at a meeting of the Palestinian National Council, they were responsible for prompting the acceptance of the proposal that Transjordan would be part of the Palestinian state to be established in the future.\n \n The open defiance caused renewed conflict between the Palestinians and the Jordanian army, whose commanders were in any case eager to finish the work they had begun in September. At the beginning of November 1970, incidences of fighting erupted between members of the PFLP and DFLP and the Jordanian security forces. On November 9, Jordanian prime minister Wasfi al-Tal, the sworn enemy of the Palestinians, announced that in accordance with the agreement signed a month earlier, the authorities would no longer allow the Palestinians to walk around with weapons or to store explosives. The announcement was not honored, and the security forces received instructions to confiscate the Palestinians' weapons.\n \n Until January 1971, the Jordanian army heightened its control in all the central cities. At the beginning of that month, the Jordanian army began an attack against the Palestinian bases along the highway between Amman and Jerash, in order to cut them off from the other cities and to take over the roads linking their strongholds. In response to the operation, the Palestinians agreed to hand over their weapons to the Jordanians. This agreement was not honored either. \n Toward the end of March, after a Palestinian arms warehouse was discovered in Irbid, the Jordanian army placed a curfew on the city, arrested some of the Palestinian activists, and expelled others. The takeover of Irbid was completed at the beginning of April. Afterward, many senior members of the Palestinian organizations, who were aware of their weakness, began to withdraw from Amman as well.\n \n Yet, despite the series of defeats, the Palestinian organizations did not give in. On June 5, the senior Palestinian organizations, including Yasser Arafat's Fatah, came out with a declaration on Radio Baghdad in which they called for the deposition of King Hussein. The reason they gave for this was that deposing him was the only way to prevent the signing of \"a peace agreement between Israel and Jordan.\" \n \n In mid-June 1971, after three tense months during which the sides made efforts to fortify their positions by political means, Jordan embarked on the final campaign against the Palestinians. The Jordanian army, which for almost 10 months had been pushing the Palestinian organizations out of the major cities, used large forces to expel them from the mountainous regions of the cities of Jerash and Ajloun, in the north of the kingdom, where about 3,000 armed Palestinians were located. \n \n The members of Fatah declared that they preferred to die in battle rather than surrender to the Jordanian dictates. After four days of battle, the Jordanian army overcame the last pockets of resistance. \n \n King Hussein held a press conference and declared that there was now \"absolute quiet\" in the kingdom. Seventy-two Palestinians who were afraid of the Jordanian soldiers chose to undertake the most humiliating action possible for them: They fled to the West Bank and surrendered to IDF soldiers.\n \n The Palestinian rout was complete. King Hussein had removed the grave threat to his throne, and had strengthened his control over the kingdom. Fatah, beaten and humiliated, established an avenging arm - called \"Black September.\" The first operation by this group took place on November 28, 1971. Four of its members assassinated Wasfi al-Tal, Jordan's prime minister and the enemy of the Palestinians, on the steps of the Sheraton Hotel in Cairo. Tal's last words were: \"They've killed me. Murderers, they believe only in fire and destruction.\"\n \n After Black September\n \n The saying that history repeats itself, once as tragedy and once as farce, has not proved itself in the Middle East. Here the tragedies tend to repeat themselves again and again. For Jordanian identity, September 1970 was a turning point. The continuing effort made by King Hussein to blur the differences between the identity of Transjordanians and that of Palestinians was replaced by the \"Jordanization\" of the administration and the army in the kingdom, and paved the way for Hussein to gradually relinquish his desire to reestablish his total sovereignty over the West Bank. The American and Israeli support of Jordan in the face of the Syrian invasion of the north of the kingdom strengthened Jordanian recognition of the fact that the stability of the kingdom depended on the support of the West.\n \n For the Palestinian leadership, Black September was the month in which it proved that the military might of its members should not be underestimated, and that it had the ability to formulate the agenda of the Arab states and of Israel. At the same time, the Palestinian leadership also proved that it wasn't aware of the limitations of its power, and had wrongly estimated the willingness and the capability of Arab countries to fight for its people. Since then, the Palestinian leadership has returned to the achievements - and the mistakes - of Black September, at every critical junction at which it has found itself.\n \n For Yasser Arafat, Black September was a test. He was asked to honor agreements, and repeatedly violated them; he was asked to rout out the extremists in his camp, and he didn't rout them out; he was asked to opt for realistic strategic goals, and he didn't opt for them. \n \n From Jordan he continued to Lebanon, from Lebanon he was expelled to Tunis, from Tunis again to Gaza and to Ramallah, where he found himself, 32 years after Black September, once again causing chaos, and once again besieged by armored forces which he will not be able to subdue.\n \n The lessons learned from the events of Black September have not been quickly forgotten. After the recent invasion of the IDF into the Palestinian cities, the Hashemite Kingdom sent several serious warnings to Israel. They included a warning about the tragic consequences of deporting Yasser Arafat back to Jordan.Black September, The PLO's attempt to take over Jordan in 1970\n \n The value of this information is to show that what is happening in Israel is neither new or unique to Israel. It reveals that the same exact tactics of violent defiance and refusing any hope of peace while demonizing the powers that be is SOP for the Palestinian Authority. It is also well known that the Jordanian military response during the Black September uprising was far more violent than any response ever undertaken by Israel, and led to 10s of thousands of Palestinian civilian deaths. Even according to Arafat, as many as 25,000 Palestinians were killed during that uprising in Jordan. That is more Palestinian dead than has been attributed to Israel since its founding in 1948. Even the numbers you posted proves that fact Jo.",

   "As for war crimes, how about the forced expulsion of palestinians from their homes at the foundation of the state of Israel - ethnic cleansing of the worst kind. Then there is the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and the construction of settlements on occupied land, all illegal under the Geneva convention and condemned by the UN. The UN may have approved the original partition, not that this makes it right given that the inhabitants of the area were given no say in the matter, but they certainly did not approve the occupation of the Palestinian territories.\n \n The IDF are notoriously trigger happy, they've shot children throwing stones, journalists, peace activists, civilians.\n \n As for the death toll:\n Israeli?Palestinian conflict - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n provides conservative estimates from an Israeli NGO.\n\n The more intelligent critics of Israel never talk about the \"thousands of Palestinians\" slaughtered by Israelis in cold blood, and it's a \"smart\" thing to do - each time an allegation like that is made, it's invariably been proven to be a figment of the fertile Arab imagination. The last example of such a \"massacre\" perpetrated by Israelis was Jenin - at first, the Palestinians and their amen corner claimed that there were 50 thousand killed, then 5 thousand, then 500, but in the end, the UN established than only several scores died and most of them were combatants.\n \n Because you didn't provide any numbers, I took a look at the link you provided and added them up myself. Here are the stats for 1987-2000 (Intifada I & II):\n Total number of Palestinians killed by Israelis: 1549\n Total number of Israelis killed by Palestinians: 421\n \n Here are the numbers for the period (2005-2008)\n Total number of Palestinians killed by Israelis: 1290\n Total number of Israelis killed by Palestinians: 86\n \n B'Tselem has done a good job documenting the Israeli-Palestinian conflicts and numbers don't lie, but people do, especially the ones who are driven by irrational hatred.\n \n I responded to your claim that Israelis slaughtered \"thousands of Palestinians\", but for some reason, you chose to delve into the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and it's just as one-sided as your prior post - although Israelis were no angels, their enemies were much worse in terms of human rights abuses. The charge of \"ethnic cleansing\" applies much more to the Arab side than to Israel - after 1949, there wasn't a single Jew left in Jordan, West Bank, and Gaza Strip, and of course over a million Jewish Arabs were forced to leave the countries they lived for millenniums. At the same time, over a 1.5 million Arabs still live in Israel, have full political rights and are proportionally represented in the Parliament. \n \n ps: The majority of Palestinian casualties are armed combatants, but the majority of Israeli victims are civilians.",

   "Well there's your first problem. The claim that the victims are militants is based on Israeli military propaganda, international media has only just been allowed into Gaza today.\n\n \n I get this problem with ALL prople.\n \n We ALL drink from a BIASED media source.\n \n And, in the US, not all media sources are pro-Israeli. So, the bias in terms of infliction and verbiage used is apparent to those of use who are exposed to that on a daily basis.\n We had this back in portent days Jo. Were you (at least I) could go through a post and point out that apparently biased words in a post someone was trying to push off as impartial.\n \n Your sources are JUST as biased in the opposite direction.\n \n \n For example, read the posts on the rammed ship.\n Take all the comments and toss them in the trash and look at the photo of the rammed ship.\n Use logic and physics and try to determine HOW such a relatively small yacht was able to NOT be sunk if it was deliberatly rammed by a military naval vessel of the Israelis?\n The damage incurred on that boat is relatively minor. The boat would have SUNK had it been deliberatly rammed by a military vessle at SPEED.\n So, with physics, it should be apparent that the military vessile BUMPED the yacht at a slow speed. As such, the yacht could have EASILY avoided the 'ramming' had that been it's intentions. \n BOTH sides are deliberatly provocative.\n Who's in the right?\n \n Morally?\n \n \n In the past several years, Israel has made MANY concessions to the Palestinians.\n Some of the Palistinians have acknowledged this as seek to work through continued political means.\n Some still cling to the terrorist organizations notions of not doing so save to gain power or breathing room to re-arm.\n You can see this in the split between Abbas and Hamas.\n \n So, I ask you, if you're traveling towards a combat zone were a listed terrorist organization is fighting your side, should you let in any tom dick and harry in?\n That yacht isn't much of a SEA worthy ship. It's COASTAL. The only calls of this incident happening in 'International waters' I've seen have been through this forum. Most others stated it was near the coast when this happened...and would have had to approach so to deliver it's cargos of 'relief'.\n \n In the end, I personally don't care about this issue in context of Israeli vs Hamas. I'm tired of being paid to watch it at work and write about it.\n There's plenty of cool-aid drinking on both sides without anyone really taking time to step in the shoes of the other side and think what they'd do in a similar situation.\n The palestinians are tools. They've shed so much blood that they can't think of anything else other than to seek revenge against their enemy. And, like an aggressive neighbor, they'll lash out with any means at hand. From shooting at your kids with BB guns to cutting down your rose bushes to letting their dog poo on your yard.\n The Israelis are like that minority family that moved into your pristine neighborhood. Celebrating loudly with their ethnic holidays and parking their hummers on your yard cause all their beemers are clogging up the street parking. They invite all their relatives to come live with them. They burn their garbage because they don't want to pay for trash removal and they have 99 pink flamingos in their yard. And they're always speaking in a foreign language when they look at you...like they're talking about you...and not in a good way cause they laugh and point while doing so.\n Oh, and their casino money has 'bought everyone' so you can't get any justice to have them 'obey your laws' or even move back to where ever they come from.\n And they're a member of a gang called 'Us' that don't like you.\n \n \n In the end, it's just an expression of how power works.\n 'What you going to do about it?\n And we're seeing that answer play out.\n Hamas launches rockets\n Israel drops bombs.\n \n \n @Chester\n \"Let's face it, the only reason the evangelicals support Israel and the ingathering of the Jews is because they believe it foreshadows the End Times.\"\n \n Yep. That and the cynical attitude that if they all too busy fighting each other OVER THERE, they won't organize enoguh to pose a threat to us over HERE. They're waisting all their energy fighting and destroying themselves.\n \n \n \n @gansao\n \"I believe that left wing liberals support the Palestinians because a sense of self loathing. If the American government supported the Palestinians they would almost certainly support the poor repressed jews. \"\n \n Yep.\n It's almost like people have to be oppositional to one another. Some naturally choosing the 'underdog' at all times...because they're representative of the downtrodden that they like to identify with themselves.\n It's like; 'hey, I'm a self percieved underdog, you're one too...we must be natural allies!'\n \n And in this fight, it's like watching a 1903 boxing match between a black man and an Irish man in Boston.

Evangelicals don't support Israel and the Jews because we believe it foreshadows the End Times at all. The reason we love the Jew is because salvation came into the world by way of the Jew since Messiah is a Jew. And because we know that God made a permanent covenant with the Jew through Abraham and promised He would never lose or forsake them as a people. And finally, because God said that He would bless those who bless the Jews and He would curse those who curse them. \n \n So, to become an enemy of Israel is to become an enemy of God and no evangelical wants to oppose God or His will. You see chester, we already know we live in the end times, and we also know that no power on Earth can destroy Israel because Gods hand is upon her. Just studying up on the 6 day war should prove that to the simplest mind. Here, educate yourself a little.\n It is appropriate, therefore, to address the question: What was the single greatest miracle of the entire Six Day War? Not an easy question, for there were so many miracles, both hidden and revealed. There is no end to the stories that have been documented from the battles: of the Egyptian tank commander in the Sinai Desert who surrendered to a vastly inferior Israeli force on the second day of the war, because a desert mirage made him see hundreds of Israeli tanks where there were no more than a dozen; of the Jordanian forces who welcomed the Israeli tanks under the command of Colonel Uri Ram into Shechem on the third day of the war, because faulty communications misled the Arabs into thinking that these were Iraqi tanks come to reinforce them; of the battle for Ammunition Hill on the northern outskirts of Jerusalem, which was captured by an Israeli scout by mistake when he fell into a Jordanian trench in the moonless night at 2:00 o'clock on Tuesday morning and started shooting from the hip (and the fall of Ammunition Hill was the necessary prelude to the capture of the Old City 30 hours later).\n \n But all these events were details, and in the details it is all too easy to forget the overall picture.\n \n A two-front war is every general's nightmare: being forced to split the armed forces has been the downfall of countless seemingly invincible armies, from Assyria, which lost a two-front war in 612 BCE, to a Babylonian-Median alliance, to the Athenian-Spartan army, which succumbed to a Persian-Roman alliance in 480 BCE, to Germany, which lost two world wars when battling Russia in the east and an Anglo-French alliance in the west. In June 1967, Israel was faced with a three-front war along the borders with Jordan, Syria and Egypt.\n \n There was, technically, a fourth front: the border with Lebanon. After firing a few token shots and sending two British-built Hunter fighter jets, which were shot down almost immediately, Lebanon withheld from further fighting. The Lebanese army remained mobilized on Israel's northern border, however, forcing Israel to keep an active force along that front.\n \n More than this: the Israeli military was outnumbered on all fronts and in all services. Israel could field a total strength of 264,000 soldiers; this included all the reserves, and could not therefore be sustained for any length of time without destroying the economy. Facing them were 525,000 Arab soldiers (of whom almost half - 240,000 - were Egyptian). Israeli tanks were outnumbered by more than three to one: 800 Israeli tanks faced 2,424 Arab tanks (again, about half - 1,200 - were Egyptian). The Israeli air force could field 350 aircraft, outnumbered almost 3 to 1 by 939 Arab aircraft (450 of them Egyptian).\n \n While the Arab countries continued to receive vast quantities of weapons from their traditional suppliers - the Soviet Union, Great Britain and, to a lesser extent, the United States - Israel's main weapon supplier, France, without warning slapped an arms embargo on Israel; so did the USA. Little wonder that while the entire Arab world, led by the Egyptian dictator \n The Israeli military was outnumbered on all fronts and in all services.\n Gamal Abdel-Nasser, was proclaiming its forthcoming triumph against Israel, and proudly trumpeting the imminent annihilation of Israel and the massacre of all her citizens (the Jewish ones, that is), Israel was preparing to fight for her very existence, and projecting - in a best-case scenario - some 10,000 dead, maybe up to 50,000, if she survived at all. Plans were made to turn national parks into mass cemeteries, even as schoolchildren were given canvas sacks and started shoveling sand into them to defend their homes.\n \n The result is history. In six days, Israel captured the entire Sinai Desert (including the Gaza Strip) from Egypt; Judea and Samaria, and half of Jerusalem, from Jordan; and the Golan Heights from Syria. Instead of being annihilated, she had more than trebled her territory from 8,000 square miles (20,500 sq. km) to 26,000 sq. miles (66,500 sq. km). Of Israel's neighbours, Lebanon alone (which, as noted above, did not attack Israel seriously) lost no land. All this came at a heavy price: 776 Israeli soldiers were killed and 2,586 wounded - more than double, in proportion to its total population, of the US losses in eight years of fighting in Vietnam. The Arab countries have never published their losses, but reliable estimates put the Egyptian war dead at 11,500 (1,500 officers, 10,000 other ranks), Syrian at 2,500, Jordanian at 1,000 - not counting the tens of thousands injured and captured.\n \n The very fact that Israel survived was a miracle; that we not merely survived, but won a decisive victory, infinitely more miraculous. Indeed, a West Point general once remarked that though the US Military Academy studies wars fought throughout the world, they do not study the Six Day War - because what concerns West Point is strategy and tactics, not miracles.\n \n What, then, was the single greatest miracle?The Six Day War: Recognizing the Miracle - Judaism - Israel National News\n \n Click on the link and read on for the answer to that question.",

In response, UNRWA (UN Relief and Works Agency) officials informed the IDF's Gaza Coordination and Liaison Administration that it was suspending the deliveries until further notice. \n \n The transfer of 40 truckloads of humanitarian supplies - some 800 tons - planned for Sunday has already been canceled. \n \n Officials in Jerusalem said the announcement by UNRWA constituted UN agreement with Israel's position that Hamas was using the Palestinian population in Gaza \"cruelly and cynically\" and was solely responsible for the hardships there. \n \n Welfare and Social Services Minister Isaac Herzog, who was appointed by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert at the end of Operation Cast Lead to coordinate Israel's humanitarian efforts in Gaza, said that theft of humanitarian aid exposed the true face of Hamas and of its supporters in Iran. \n \n It was the second time this past week that Hamas stole UN supplies meant for impoverished Gazans. \n \n The first incident took place on Tuesday evening, when armed Hamas police broke into a Gaza warehouse packed with UN humanitarian supplies and seized thousands of blankets and food packages. \n \n The seizure took place after UNRWA staff earlier refused to hand over the supplies to the Hamas-run Social Affairs Ministry. \n \n \"We received a phone call this morning from UNRWA officials that they have decided to suspend their deliveries after Hamas stole supplies from one of the organization's warehouses in the Gaza Strip,\" explained a senior official. \n \n The official said the IDF noticed the trend during Operation Cast Lead last month when, despite the fighting, Israel transferred close to 80 trucks a day to the Strip. \n \n Nuaf Atar, a Fatah operative captured during the operation, told the Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) that Hamas government officials \"took over\" humanitarian aid Israel allowed in and sold it when it was supposed to be distributed for free. \n \n UNRWA spokesman Sami Mshasha confirmed that the organization had suspended its deliveries to Gaza after Hamas stole its supplies. \n \n \"This is the second incident this week and this is a point of great concern for us and sets a bad precedent. If we are to provide services to people in Gaza after such an ordeal, we need assurances that our work will be unimpeded,\" Mshasha said. \"We cannot subjugate our work to the Social Affairs Ministry in Gaza.\"\n \n UNRWA suspends aid to Gaza after Hamas again seizes supplies | Middle East | Jerusalem Post\n\n \n Simone take your antisemitism and your lies and cram it.",
