He had scouted all the colleges and even the Canadian and European Leagues, but he couldn't find a ringer who could ensure a Super Bowl win.\n \n Then one night while watching CNN he saw a war-zone scene in Afghanistan . In one corner of the background, he spotted a young Afghan Muslim soldier with a truly incredible arm. He threw a hand-grenade straight into a 15th story window 100 yards away.\n \n KABOOM!\n \n He threw another hand-grenade 75 yards away, right into a chimney.\n \n KA-BLOOEY!\n \n Then he threw another at a passing car g oing 90 mph.\n \n BULLS-EYE!\n \n \"I've got to get this guy!\" Coach said to himself. \"He has the perfect arm!\"\n \n So, he brings him to the States and teaches him the great game of football. And the Raiders go on to win the Super Bowl.\n \n The young Afghan is hailed as the great hero of football, and when the coach asks him what he wants, all the young man wants is to call his mother.\n \n \"Mom,\" he says into the phone, \"I just won the Super Bowl!\"\n \n \"I don't want to talk to you, the old Muslim woman says.\"You are not my son!\"\n \n \"I don't think you understand, Mother,\" the young man pleads. \"I've won the greatest sporting event in the world. I'm here among thousands of my adoring fans.\"\n \n \"No! Let me tell you!\" his mother retorts. \"At this very moment, there are gunshots and explosions all around us. The neighborhood is a pile of rubble. Your two brothers were beaten within an inch of their lives last week, and I have to keep your sister in the house so she doesn't get raped!\" The old lady pauses, and then tearfully says, \"I will never forgive you for making us move to Oakland!!\"",

It's late at night and he's getting ready to go to bed--and there's a knock on the door. \n \n He goes to the door and opens it.... \n \n And it's a snail.\n \n The snail says, \"I'd like to talk to you about buying some magazine subscriptions.\"\n \n The man is furious that he's been interrupted.

   "A hippie gets onto a bus and sits next to a nun in the front seat. The hippie looks over and asks the nun if she would have sex with him.\n \n The nun, surprised by the question, politely declines and gets off at the next stop. When the bus starts again, the bus driver says to the hippie, \"If you want, I can tell you how you can get that nun to have sex with you.\"\n \n The hippie of course says that he'd love to know, so the bus driver tells him that every Tuesday evening at midnight the nun goes to the cemetery to pray to the lord. \"If you went dressed in robes and some glowing powder,\" says the bus driver, \"You could tell her you were God and command her to have sex with you.\"\n \n The hippie decides to try this out. That Tuesday, he goes to the cemetery and waits for the nun. Right on schedule, the nun shows up. While she's in the middle of praying, the hippie walks out from hiding, in robes and glowing with a mask of god. \"I am God, I have heard your prayers and I will answer them but you must have sex with me first,\" he says.\n \n The nun agrees but asks for anal sex so she might keep her virginity. The hippie agrees to this and quickly sets about having sex with the nun.\n \n After the hippie finishes, he rips off his mask and shouts out, \"Ha ha, I'm the hippie! \"\n \n The nun replies by whipping off her mask and shouting, \"Ha ha, I'm the bus driver!\"\n \n ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n \n MEMO FROM ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT\n \n It has come to our attention recently that many of you have been turning in timesheets that specify large amounts of \"Miscellaneous Unproductive Time\" (Code 5309).
