   "SAN FRANCISCO - Young gay people whose parents or guardians responded negatively when they revealed their sexual orientation were more likely to attempt suicide, experience severe depression and use drugs than those whose families accepted the news, according to a new study.\n \n The way in which parents or guardians respond to a youth's sexual orientation profoundly influences the child's mental health as an adult, say researchers at San Francisco State University, whose findings appear in Monday's journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n \n \"Parents love their children and want the best for them,\" said lead researcher Caitlin Ryan, a social worker who directs the university's Family Acceptance Project. \"Now that we have measured all these behaviors, we can see that some of them put youth at extremely high risk and others are wellness-promoting.\"\n \n Among other findings, the study showed that teens who experienced negative feedback were more than eight times as likely to have attempted suicide, nearly six times as vulnerable to severe depression and more than three times at risk of drug use.\n \n More significantly, Ryan said, ongoing work at San Francisco State suggests that parents who take even baby steps to respond with equanimity instead of rejection can dramatically improve a gay youth's mental health outlook.\n \n One of the most startling findings was that being forbidden to associate with gay peers was as damaging as being physically beaten or verbally abused by their parents in terms of negative feedback, Ryan said.\n \n In the two-part study, Ryan and her colleagues first interviewed 53 families with gay teenagers to identify 106 specific behaviors that could be considered \"accepting\" or \"rejecting.\" For example, blaming a youth for being bullied at school, shielding him from other relatives or belittling her appearance for not conforming to social expectations fell into the rejecting category.\n \n Next, they surveyed 224 white and Latino gay people between ages 21 and 25 to see which of the behaviors they had experienced growing up. The responses then were matched against the participants' recent histories of severe depression, suicide attempts, substance abuse and unsafe sexual behavior.\n Study: Family behavior key to health of gay youth - Yahoo! News\n This is yet another study showing the obvious, to people who will never comprehend the obvious.\n \n When gays are more likely to experience depression or become alcoholics, that is a symptom of the anti-gay society we live in.\n Unlike some people's claims (Archie), it is NOT a sign of an \"inherent\" / internal perception that what we are is wrong. emoticon_xdonno",

   "\n Happy for the child? I'd be curious what the alternatives are?\n To feel \"sad\" for the child? \"Angry\" for the child?\n I would think \"tolerance\" would require, at worst, indifference. They treat the child's situation like they would any other friend who is in the child's life.\n \n\n \n I don't think it would be out of line for a religious family to not be happy with their child that chooses a gay lifestyle. Why would a family be \"happy\" for another family member when they choose to do something they believe is wrong. This isn't to say they shouldnt still love them, they should. But you can condem someones actions and still love them.\n \n \n\"Invite their partner to christmas dinner?\" Yes.\n Or at the very least, allow it to be the son/daughter's decision on the subject, free of repercussion.\n\n \n Why would you expect them to do this. If their child was a thief would you expect them to allow the other gang members to christmas dinner? While being gay may not be a choice, acting on those impulses is. To expect a family to support a decision they believe to be wrong/sinful is absurd.\n \n \nAnything less would obviously fall under the comments above regarding \"forbidden to associate with gay peers was as damaging as being physically beaten or verbally abused by their parents in terms of negative feedback\".\n\n \n Not inviting someone to dinner hardly falls under \"forbidden to associate\".\n \n \nRegarding your claim, can you document your claim that Buddhists are anti-gay?\n\n \n First off, I never said they were anti-gay. Stop putting word in my mouth. I said they \"teach against homosexual acts\". Not the same thing, except maybe in your narrow vision of the world. Secondly, yes I can document it. These quotes are taken from Wiki but the sources are provided in the wiki article if you care to read them. The heading is Buddhism and homosexuality.\n \n \nGampopa, often called the founder of Tibetan Buddhism, wrote (in the 12th century) that anal sex was a violation of the third precept regarding sexual misconduct. Longchenpa, 13th century founder of the Nyingma school, elaborated that sexual misconduct includes \"intercourse in forbidden parts of the body, such as the hands.\" [24]\n \n The current Dalai Lama interprets sexual misconduct to include lesbian and gay sex, and indeed any sex other than penis-vagina intercourse, including oral sex, anal sex, and masturbation.[25] He explained in 1997:[26] \"It's part of what we Buddhists call bad sexual conduct. Sexual organs were created for reproduction between the male element and the female element-and everything that deviates from that is not acceptable from a Buddhist point of view.\"\n\n \nTheravada Buddhism\n In Thailand, traditional accounts propose that \"homosexuality arises as a karmic consequence of violating Buddhist proscriptions against heterosexual misconduct. These karmic accounts describe homosexuality as a congenital condition which cannot be altered, at least in a homosexual person's current lifetime, and have been linked with calls for compassion and understanding from the non-homosexual populace.\"[31] Some more recent Thai Buddhist accounts (from the late 1980s) have \"described homosexuality as a wilful violation of \"natural\" (hetero)sexual conduct resulting from lack of ethical control over sexual impulses.\"[\n\n \nIn Chinese Buddhism, homosexuality was a third level sin punishable in one of the nine hells.[42] Marie-Eve Blanc writes that \"Mahayana Buddhism (as in China and Vietnam) is less tolerant than Theravada Buddhism (Thailand).\"[\n\n \n \nSo did you ever look up that Spitzer study?\n Or is this claim of yours going to go the route of your earlier claim of going to look at the Spitzer study?\n\n \n Yes, I have looked up the Spitzer study. Although due to the holidays I haven't read the full study yet, just a synopsis. I also have read the synopsis of a couple of peer reviews of Spitzers work, not flattering. Now that things are getting back to normal I should have time to read the whole thing.\n I'm actually having some trouble finding a full version of the study mentioned in this article.

   "I hate to be a spoil sport, but I'll actually address the opening post. No one has seemed to understand this is a study we are talking about. This is a description of observations. Not liking these observations is your prerogative, but \"disagreeing\" with them with out addressing the observations themselves makes no sense. If you think the observations are wrong, then address the possible problems with the methods used to reach those conclusions. \n \n That study reached some striking conclusions. How can they be explained? Anyone???\n Also, the outcomes that resulted from certain parental behavior are drug abuse, depression and suicide. Aren't these outcomes bad enough to be concerned about addressing certain parental behavior? How can one not at least question whether it is OK to treat your children in a way that leads to these outcomes??\n \n Now, that said, I can't find any study that has been performed. (There are no details of the methods, and the website gives no indication of the authors or publication.) My guess is this organization has completed a study and is discussing its findings prior to publication. That can be a problem as it has not undergone peer review and as such, any results should be suspect. \n \n Another issue has been raised in this thread - the idea that there is a middle ground between complete acceptance and rejection of one's child, like it's OK to reject him just a little.

Asking them to not \"be\" gay, like not mentioning it, or hanging with gay friends or bringing a boyfriend by, is telling them that being gay is not OK and as such, the kid is not OK.\n\n From my perspective, you're preaching to the choir.\n \n Regarding the people who SHOULD BE listening to your message, it's probably falling on deaf ears regardless of the fact that it is very well stated.\n Or probably more accurately, falling on deaf ears BECAUSE it's very well stated...\n \n \n \nIf the findings in that study are accurate - and they seem completely reasonable - it is no surprise. The worst thing a kid can hear is that he is not loved by his parents. Parents who reject an inherent and important part of their child's being are not acting lovingly.\n Telling your child that being gay is not OK (hating the sin) is inconsistent with telling them they are OK (loving the sinner). You cannot possibly do both.\n\n I think that is something that the people who are \"against\" homosexuality, and especially those who pretend that it can involve a \"choice\" to be a homosexual, inherently do not get.\n \n I am just baffled by the insistence by some to water down what happens to gays, or to try to fixate on something that cannot be shown to legitimately happen. I have a variety of gay friends, and they end up on one of two ends of a spectrum.\n 1) The parent accepts the gay child for who he is...\n 2) The parent does not tolerate the child's homosexuality, causing a severe rift (to put it lightly) in the relationship.\n \n People who talk about \"hating the sin, loving the sinner\" here are interestingly enough asking OTHER PEOPLE for details, instead of providing their own.\n Under the \"hating the sin, loving the sinner\" philosophy...\n ** Does the gay son's partner get to come to Christmas?\n ** Do the parents tell the gay son \"you can't have sex under my roof\" when the child visits?\n ** If the gay son gets his heart broken in a failed relationship, will the parents hear his problems? Or will they turn a deaf ear to the son's pain?\n HOW would this supposedly work?",

   "This is the trailer for Prayers For Bobby, a Lifetime TV movie that will premiere this Saturday: \n YouTube - Prayers For Bobby - Next Saturday at 9pm/8c on Lifetime\n \n Now, this film is based on the true story of Bobby Griffith, a gay man who committed suicide at age 20, and his mother Mary, who had tried to convince her son \"pray away\" his gayness during his life, only to realize the error of her ways and to become a gay rights champion after Bobby's death. It is a real and powerful tale that can only be told in one way: The way it actually happened.\n \n Well leave it to the spinners at Focus on the Family to lash out against actuality. In a new report posted to their CitizenLink site, the \"pro-family\" organization preemptively attacks the film for supposedly portraying Christians in a negative light:\n  The Lifetime Channel is airing a controversial new movie this weekend in which conservative Christian parents shoulder the blame after their gay-identified son commits suicide. \"Prayers for Bobby,\" based on a true story from the 1970s, stars Sigourney Weaver.\n \n Family advocates are concerned the film tells only half of the story, leaving out the redemptive power of Jesus Christ.\n \n Louisiana mom Terri Brown can identify with the parents in the movie. For 17 years, she has prayed that her son would find freedom from the homosexual identity.\n \n \"I can understand a mother's despair,\" she said, \"especially a Christian mother's despair. Because we know what the Bible says about homosexuality.\n \n \"My heart goes out to people that struggle with homosexuality. They did not ask for that struggle. What do we do with our sin nature? We take it to the Lord and let Him renew our minds and hearts.\"\n \n Jeff Johnston, gender analyst at Focus on the Family, said the movie's message runs contrary to God's.\n \n \"Parents can love their kids and still hold to what the Bible says about homosexuality and human sexuality,\" he said.\n \n Johnston said the movie does send a strong message about the importance of fathers.\n \n \"Boys need dads who are loving and strong,\" he said, \"but who reach out to them when they are struggling with sexuality or sexual issues.\"\n \n No matter where the movie lands, Johnston said, people can and do change their sexual orientation - he's living proof. CitizenLink: Lifetime Movie Casts Christians in Ugly Role\n \n Your 'prayers for Bobby' have done quite enough, FOF! - Good As You:: Gay and Lesbian Activism With a Sense of Humor\n \n Another excellent example of the topic of this thread.\n Family Behavior is KEY to Health of Gay Youth...\n \n Some people have tried to push the boundaries of what is a \"negative\" reaction. Trying to insist that behavior, when applied to a LONG LIST of other analogous behavior, would be unquestionably \"negative\", but when applied to homosexuality it is pretended to be \"help\".\n \n What some Christians don't seem to realize is that telling people to \"pray away\" their homosexuality is giving them false hope. Anybody who reviews Spitzer's study on \"ex-gays\" will easily realize a couple things...\n 1) The \"ex-gay\" crowd habitually exaggerates their success.\n 2) Telling gays that they can \"pray away\" their gay won't work...\n \n Furthermore, if you take a kid who is gay, give them the hope that they can \"pray away\" their homosexuality while at the same time driving into them that homosexuality is evil, the inevitable response is that when the kid is STILL GAY he will feel inferior and neglected by a god which didn't do as people promised...",

It makes up most of the situation.\n You're coming along insisting on \"no snow in December in Juneau\", and I'm talking about snow in December in Juneau.\n And then instead of admitting to the reality of the situation, you try to exaggerate the \"success\".\n \n \n \nPeople can always speculate (particularly when they don't WANT the testimonials to be true. :) ) I'm just trying to show that this side of it is out there.\n\n Dr. Spitzer's side documents what is \"out there\".\n What you just did is ask a travelling salesman if his tonic water works...\n \n \n \nNo one is making you get on board with it, so chill out.\n\n You criticize me for not debating, and you try to comment like this....\n Hypocritical much?\n \n \n \nThen why are you being argumentative about letting the facts of these TESTIMONIALS known?\n\n CLAFCLOW.\n My point is that the TRUE INFO needs to be revealed.\n Not just the claims of the drug company...\n We need independent and objective analysis of the CHANCES for success, and honest admission of the potential for negative impact.\n Please. Take more effort to accurately admit what I am talking about...\n \n \n \nIf all you want to do is let the facts known, than it would stand to reason you'd want MORE information out there, not less. After all, these testimonials aren't shown to be false and erroneous.\n\n emoticon_frazzled\n They aren't shown to be TRUE either.\n There is no documentation behind them to show the progress of the patient AFTER they get the \"documented\" statement.\n And these \"ex-gay\" organizations have been demonstrated to lie.\n \n \n \nYou're wrong; It's not medical fraud. Whether you want to admit or not, this issue is a very controversial one in society, and the stance you're taking is begging the question.\n\n Yup. There you go again.\n It's a MEDICAL issue, and you try to shift the context to \"controversial one in society\".\n The MEDICAL facts need to be presented.\n How badly the ex-gays want it is not relevant.\n \n \n \nNot everyone agrees with you that gay relationships are ok. You're starting from that premise rather than coming to it. But others don't agree with you on that premise.\n\n Irrelevant to the point.\n This is about the HEALTH OF GAY YOUTH.\n \n And in reply, you are demonstrating one of the reasons why I don't think people on the anti-gay side take this issue within the full context.\n YES. People who think \"gay relationships are not ok\" DO exist.\n Does that mean that anything they do to try to eliminate gays is okay?\n Of course not.\n \n \n \nIf my kid is into drugs, and I send him to a camp, it's entirely possible it could make other things in his life WORSE. It MIGHT make him depressed, for instance. But that doesn't mean I don't need to send him to a camp.\n\n And therein lies the real issue.\n The negative impact of drugs can easily be demonstrated. A very real consequence. Drug use is illegal, in addition to documenting the harm that drug addictiveness does. So they aren't anywhere near in the same category.\n \n \n \n But when it comes to the \"gay\" situation, it's solely an issue of religious persecution.\n \n Furthermore, you talk about a \"risk\" from drug addiction, but then repeatedly fail to document it.\n Here, the risk for negative impact from reparative therapy IS PROVEN.\n How about you do the same for your counter-example.\n \n Otherwise, we've got a case where we have people motivated by religious prejudice, who don't have any documented info from the \"reparative therapy\" groups regarding the potentials for damage or an honest accounting of the chances for what they claim to come to reality.\n \n And on the other hand, we have documented harm from drugs, weighed against something you claim exists (depression from drug addiction therapy)...\n \n \n \nNow you're going to act all outraged and cry foul 'cause I compared a drug camp to this, or homosexual relationships to drugs, but that's tough. You need to at least REALIZE and ACKNOWLEDGE that yours isn't the only view on the issue.\n\n I think it would be amusing to keep track of exactly how many times you are wrong on your assessment.\n Not \"outraged\", but your comparison is bogus.\n \n \n \nWell of course you do. You're part of the gay pride movement who views gays being 'out' as a priority.\n\n So you have no problem with parents of a gay child forcing their child into reparative therapy, against the child's wishes?",

   "Can you give me any legitimate reason for your \"matter of opinion\"?\n\n \n The problems with the APA and the history of how it was taken over by idealogues has been posted here before, and is well known, at least to those who are willing to question such an organisation. Naturally, you like them because they say what you want to hear. Again, if they didn't, you'd drop your view of them being objective like a hot potato.\n \n \nLet me toss out a standard that you are obviously free to discuss, refute whatever... Any organization that REQUIRES its members to have a certain opinion about homosexuality before they can join is not \"objective\".\n\n \n That's ironic, because the APA is known to discriminate against people DON'T hold their views about homosexuality.\n \n I agree, that's not objective or independent. emoticon_xagree\n \n \nYou mock me for not agreeing to something I never even hinted at agreeing with?\n\n \n So then you WOULD be ok with these camps if they didn't say that??? You're fine with them as long as they don't say mean things to gays? The point (which you're obviously missing) is that you use an example of someone saying something mean to someone, but a solution to that is simple: they need to stop saying mean things to people. That's different than having to close down the camp.\n \n \nI am not saying that every group says things like this.\n\n \n And I didn't say you made that claim.\n \n \nBLOWI.\n I never hinted or \"indicated\" that this was typical.\n\n \n And I didn't claim you DID hint or indicate it was typical. LISTEN to what I said rather than react in a knee jerk way.\n \n \nJyoshu, one thing you are going to have to learn is that these conversations are going to be pretty short if you insist on replying to what I never implied...\n\n \n talk about the pot calling the kettle black ....\n \n \nThen why bring it up?\n Why try to misdirect by talking about other psychological health risks, when the obvious topic is one SPECIFIC psychological health risks?\n\n \n Because in terms of possible risks, that risk is always going to be there with doing something difficult in life.\n \n \nThese organizations don't even hint that there are negative repercussions.\n With drugs, they are required to inform the public that they could cause diahrrea, sleeplessness, acid indigestion, etc, etc, etc...\n But with ex-gay groups, DO ANY actually admit openly to the negative consequences?\n \n Drug company analogy ...\n \n travelling salesman w tonic water analogy ...\n\n \n Foundit, you're missing a key point here. These are testimonials of PEOPLE. PEOPLE said that. Not some evil bureaucratic organization. People. Not a drug company. Not a peddler of snake oil. People. Your examples of money making industries don't take that into account. You keep trying to argue against organizations, but these are letters of individuals--real people. Do you get that? Not to mention that, even if it weren't real people saying these things, the organization that reported it is a non-profit. And let's face it, it's not like the gay pride movement is going to acknowledge they are there. So the ONLY way these peoples' stories is going to get out there is if a site like this reports it. (Which is really the point.)\n \n I'm not going to argue with you on what the organizations do or don't do; that's something you're bringing to what I said that I didn't. It's a straw man as far as my point is concerned. My reason for posting the link to the testimonials is because it needs to be put out there as well.\n \n \nHave any done ANY RESEARCH to document how many of their patients have failed, or how many will encounter problems, to make this info public?\n\n \n Again, I'm not taking issue with you on those things. Why are you AVOIDING the issue of the testimonials here? \n \n \nCLAFCLOW.\n I am not pretending \"testimonials\" don't exist.\n\n \n If you're not pretending they don't exist, why do you basically reject these folks' testimonials out of hand? Anything but give them possible credence I guess. Anything but dare actually consider (Gasp!) the possibility it worked for them ... \n \n \nI EXPLICITLY EXPLAINED WHY these testimonials exist.\n\n \n LOL. No, what you did was give an 'Anything-But-Legit' approach of an opinon of what you think they're about ('legit' in terms of them possibly working, I mean). Always the biased explanation. 'They're really bi-sexual.' Or, 'it really only worked for a couple of weeks ...' It's patently insulting that you won't just take these people for what they're telling you. I know I'd be insulted, anyway. Did you actually READ the testimonials, by the way. \n \n \nThe \"big issue\" is that people DO NOT realize \"Family behavior key to health of gay youth\".\n I quoted an ex-gay organization which obviously TRIVIALIZES this...\n\n \n And let me guess ... the only family behavior you're open to is one that isn't open to any objection toward anything gay-related. The only way to have good \"family behavior\" about this is to drop any religious objection, right? emoticon_rolleyes\n \n But again, you're trying to deflect to the issue of organisations. These are the accounts of INDIVIDUALS.\n \n \nQuite frankly, I think it's a rational standard to insist that \"treatment\" include disclosure to the patient of the potential for harm, and what the REAL chances for \"help\" truly are.\n\n \n Sure, whatever. For organizations. But testimonials (what you don't want to discuss) don't need a 'disclaimer.' The point is that, if left up to the gay pride groups that make it an issue to oppose 'ex-gays', we'd never even KNOW about these accounts.\n \n \nCLAFCLOW.\n I didn't say I was going to change the situation.\n\n \n And I didn't say you said anything there.\n \n \nI was just pointing out how reprehensible it is, and how that judgment is deserved. \n\n \n My point is that your judgment is irrelevant. Who the hell are you to say they are being a bad parent? You don't know their individual situations. Get over yourself!\n \n \nHOW is that comment even important to the real situation?\n If cigarettes cause cancer, is it an intelligent response to point out that we haven't commented that the person could die in a car accident?\n\n \n Bad analogy. Cigarettes have a direct CHEMICAL effect on the body, that casues cancer. You're talking about psychological matters. Going to a camp that will change their lives and get them out of their comfort zone could always potentially cause depression, or whatever. I've heard cases of kids committing suicide after their parents grounded them. I guess by your logic parents should never ground their kids for anything.\n \n \nNo, no, no, no...\n The fact that people CLAIM to successfully change, and then later \"relapse\" is not \"snow in June\". It is a VERY real statistic. It makes up most of the situation.\n\n \n Foundit. The fact SOME people do this isn't proof that the testimonials aren't real; or that what is accounted in the testimonials can't happen. Furthermore, that someone 'relapses' doesn't prove it can't work anyway. I suppose people in drug recovery programs should just assume it will never work if they relapse ... \n \n \nMy point is that the TRUE INFO needs to be revealed.\n\n \n Who are you to say these people aren't giving you \"true info\" about their lives? The \"true info\" you're referring to is ALREADY out there. You linked to it, after all. But the eagerness by which you would try and explain away these testimonials as anything but real shows just how much THEIR accounts are the ones that need to be revealed. \n \n \nNot just the claims of the drug company...\n We need independent and objective analysis of the CHANCES for success, and honest admission of the potential for negative impact.\n Please. Take more effort to accurately admit what I am talking about...\n\n \n Foundit, don't give me that. If you REALLY cared, you'd contact these individuals in the testimonials with an OPEN mind. You don't really want their claims given objective analysis--you passed judgment on their merits WITHOUT ANY analysis!! Looks like you need to take your own advice ...\n \n \nYup. There you go again.\n It's a MEDICAL issue, and you try to shift the context to \"controversial one in society\".\n\n \n It IS a controversial issue, and you're begging the question with your preconceived premises.\n \n \nThe negative impact of drugs can easily be demonstrated. A very real consequence. Drug use is illegal, in addition to documenting the harm that drug addictiveness does. So they aren't anywhere near in the same category.\n\n \n Yet you use the analogy of the drug company and tonic water, which are cases that can also easily be demonstrated. Hypocritical any?\n \n \nHere, the risk for negative impact from reparative therapy IS PROVEN.\n How about you do the same for your counter-example.\n\n \n Where is it proven, Foundit? Your article certainly doesn't PROVE it. Evidence maybe. Proof? Um, no.\n \n \nI think it would be amusing to keep track of exactly how many times you are wrong on your assessment.\n\n \n I know you do. Just as you want to start threads about and against posters, where others can weigh in. It's a consistent problem you have.\n \n \nSo you have no problem with parents of a gay child forcing their child into reparative therapy, against the child's wishes?\n\n \n Again, parents have to do things ALL THE TIME which are against the child's wishes. I'm not going to sit here and be in judgment on parents as you are doing, Foundit. You don't know their individual situations. They are INFINITELY more familiar with their child's life, history, temperament, and psychological health that YOU are.",

Naturally, you like them because they say what you want to hear. Again, if they didn't, you'd drop your view of them being objective like a hot potato.\n\n Yeah.\n The expected attempt to avoid DEBATE (funny how you criticized me for avoiding it) in justifying a thoroughly ludicrous statement.\n \"taken over by idealogues\"???\n Exactly how so?\n Is this in conjunction with their conclusion that homosexuality is not a mental illness?\n Is this in conjunction with their acknowledgement of the overwhelming research that shows gays are just as capable parents?\n Is this in conjunction with their conclusions that gay couples would benefit from gay marriage?\n \n Jyoshu, I AM MORE THAN WILLING to question the issue at hand.\n You, on the other hand, are obviously trying to avoid justifying your claims.\n \n Tell you what Jyoshu. POINT ME TO THE THREAD where this supposed discussion took place.\n Cause I have tried to start similar discussions in the past, trying to get people who had vague allegations to actually show where the APA was wrong or went wrong. They were lonely threads, cause when push comes to shove people make claims like the one you threw out there, but they can't justify them.\n \n \n \nThat's ironic, because the APA is known to discriminate against people DON'T hold their views about homosexuality.\n\n Really?\n And you can document this claim?\n Would \"Paul Cameron\" be an up and coming example for you?\n \n \n \nSo then you WOULD be ok with these camps if they didn't say that???\n\n Let me repeat what I said, and this time try to read and COMPREHEND...\n You mock me for not agreeing to something I never even hinted at agreeing with?\n To make it plain, I never even hinted that was my only problem with these camps. So attempting to mock me in the way you did was absurd.\n \n \n \nThe point (which you're obviously missing) is that you use an example of someone saying something mean to someone, but a solution to that is simple: they need to stop saying mean things to people. That's different than having to close down the camp.\n\n That was an example of a bigger picture. A MUCH bigger picture.\n Would you care to review their statements on gays? Review web-sites to see them make claims about how shallow and unnatural gay lives are?\n \n If we said that about Christianity, you would accuse people of bigotry.\n But when it comes to Christians, you quickly rush to the defense and proclaim \"that's what they believe\".\n \n There are other examples beyond just the one you quoted.\n Do we need to start naming them?\n \n Or can you acknowledge that I've been listing quite a few in these posts...\n \n \n \nAnd I didn't say you made that claim.\n\n I swear Jyoshu. It's funny to watch you try to back-peddle out of things.\n You said: \"In fact, you use those statements as if they as if they were indicative of ...\"\n I said: \"I never hinted or \"indicated\" that this was typical.\"\n \n You clearly made a claim about how I was using those statements.\n THAT is what I was refuting.\n \n I never said that you said I made that claim. That's not how you work. You use weasel words to try to make accusations of \"implications\".\n I get that. That's why I didn't say that you said that I made that \"claim\".\n The problem was your false assessment of \"hinted or 'indicated'\".\n emoticon_xdonno\n \n \n \nAnd I didn't claim you DID hint or indicate it was typical. LISTEN to what I said rather than react in a knee jerk way.\n\n Again, I quote Jyoshu's statement...\n You said: \"In fact, you use those statements as if they as if they were indicative of ...\"\n \n So, if I didn't \"claim\" that, didn't \"hint\" that, didn't \"indicate\" that, what the heck does your statement even mean?\n Oh yeah. You're just trying to find another way to complain about a strawman...\n \n \n \ntalk about the pot calling the kettle black ....\n\n You are welcome to prove your accusation, if you can.\n Simply tossing it out there is rather convenient, especially when I repeatedly give (and defend) examples of you doing that...\n You can't say the same...\n \n \n \nBecause in terms of possible risks, that risk is always going to be there with doing something difficult in life.\n\n BLOWI.\n I welcome you to document ANYWHERE NEAR the level of problems that were shown in this research article...\n You're trying to compare a mountain to the CLAIMED existence of what? A mole-hill? An ant-hill?\n \n If you told somebody that doing something would make them three times more likely to die of cancer, would they do it?\n \n \n \nFoundit, you're missing a key point here. These are testimonials of PEOPLE. PEOPLE said that. Not some evil bureaucratic organization. People. Not a drug company. Not a peddler of snake oil.\n\n Jyoshu, YOU are missing a key point here.\n People who leave a chiropracter may say one thing on an exit interview. He \"helped\" me. I feel a million times better. blah, blah, blah.\n People can \"say\" something.\n But then, if you look at the same people many weeks down the road, how have they truly been helped?\n REAL therapy analysis examines the WHOLE picture. Not just ONE statement taken at ONE point in time.\n \n \n \nYour examples of money making industries don't take that into account.\n\n Jyoshu, don't you think they can quote \"real people\" as well?\n emoticon_xdonno\n The analogy fits.\n And if you don't think ex-gay and anti-gay aren't huge money making industries, you're fooling yourself...\n \n \n \nAnd let's face it, it's not like the gay pride movement is going to acknowledge they are there. So the ONLY way these peoples' stories is going to get out there is if a site like this reports it. (Which is really the point.)\n\n Why do you talk about the \"gay pride movement\" acknowledging them?\n It's not the \"gay pride movements\" job to do anything about the situation.\n The APA would be a much better example, and what the APA SAYS about reparative therapy is one of the REAL reasons you want to discount them...\n \n \n \nAgain, I'm not taking issue with you on those things. Why are you AVOIDING the issue of the testimonials here? \n\n emoticon_xdonno emoticon_wow\n I am shocked.\n HOW can you insist on the \"testimonials\", but then not care about the fact that we have no follow-up to determine the REAL efficacy of the \"reparative therapy\"???\n \n A charlatan could give a cancer patient pain killers instead of therapy to kill the cancer. The patient could feel tons better, with increased capabilities, but the patient wouldn't realize that he was still sick until after the \"therapy\" had stopped.\n Likewise, taking \"testimonials\" from these people shortly after they get out IS MEANINGLESS.\n \n Are you seriously wanting the \"testimonials\" cause you have no problem (or rather desire) people to report about the short-term \"high\" they get when they are still in the after-glow of reparative therapy? Focusing on that to somehow soothe the minds of people who don't want others to see the crash that occurs later???\n \n I really don't get how you can just blazenly \"not take issue\" with my point, yet still insist on the testimonials. It's a nonsensical approach.\n The ESSENCE of what I am talking about is how accurate are the \"testimonials\" weeks AFTER the testimonial was given.\n Shouldn't THAT be important also? Or is it just the short-term effects you want to focus on?\n \n \n \nIf you're not pretending they don't exist, why do you basically reject these folks' testimonials out of hand? Anything but give them possible credence I guess. Anything but dare actually consider (Gasp!) the possibility it worked for them ... \n\n Are you even listening to me?\n How many times do I have to explain this?\n The \"testimonial\" they gave when the reparative therapy WANTS TO QUOTE the individual is typically entirely different from the testimonial that the reparative therapy groups WANT TO IGNORE weeks or months later...\n There are tons of examples of these groups having \"poster children\" for ex-gay causes, and then dumping them to the curb, ignoring what REALLY happened to them after the person came out \"still gay\"...\n \n \n \nLOL. No, what you did was give an 'Anything-But-Legit' approach of an opinon of what you think they're about ('legit' in terms of them possibly working, I mean). Always the biased explanation.\n\n Jyoshu, I have repeatedly asked why don't we listen to the OBJECTIVE AND INDEPENDENT VIEWERS.\n Dr. Spitzer's study. OTHER people doing studies on \"ex-gay\" groups.\n \n Quite frankly, I wouldn't want to quote JUST the \"gay groups\" statements on ex-gay therapy. WHY do you only want to quote the EX-gay groups statements?\n Oh yea. I know. Cause you don't want to admit that when it comes to INDEPENDENT AND OBJECTIVE review, the ex-gay groups fail.\n \n \n \nAnd let me guess ... the only family behavior you're open to is one that isn't open to any objection toward anything gay-related. The only way to have good \"family behavior\" about this is to drop any religious objection, right?\n\n I refer back to the original article.\n It talks about how cutting the gay youth off from gay peers WAS DOCUMENTED AS HARMFUL.\n The funny thing here is that you're not really fighting against me on this.\n The STUDY proves you and your stance wrong. You just want to create these undocumented fairy tales whereby you want to imagine things to be...\n \n \n \nBut again, you're trying to deflect to the issue of organisations. These are the accounts of INDIVIDUALS.\n\n Yeah. And if I go to a drug company's web-site, it will have quotes from \"INDIVIDUALS\" who love their drug.\n Doesn't mean squat about potential harmful side-effects.\n Doesn't mean the drug company reported what happened to that individual the weak afterwards.\n \n \n \nSure, whatever. For organizations. But testimonials (what you don't want to discuss) don't need a 'disclaimer.'\n\n You're acting like it's not the reparative therapy organizations (or organizations tied closely to them) which are giving these testimonials...\n \n \n \nThe point is that, if left up to the gay pride groups that make it an issue to oppose 'ex-gays', we'd never even KNOW about these accounts.\n\n Why is that even a point?\n If it was left up to the ex-gay organizations and the anti-gay Christian organizations, you'd never hear anything positive about gays.\n At least I'm not trying to hide the truth here...\n \n \n \nAnd I didn't say you said anything there.\n\n But interestingly enough, you avoided what I DID SAY YET AGAIN.\n The parents we're talking about are condemnable. Committing acts which are obviously AGAINST their child's real best interests.\n I acknowledge I can't stop it.\n But I sure as heck will point out these anti-gay Christian activities where they are seen, and I won't white-wash the situation either.\n \n \n \nMy point is that your judgment is irrelevant.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n If you truly believed that, why are you even bothering to respond.\n \n \n \nWho the hell are you to say they are being a bad parent? You don't know their individual situations. Get over yourself!\n\n What \"individual situation\" justifies a parent, taking a gay child and forcing the kid into an ex-gay camp where the kid will be much more likely to be harmed by the experience, with consequences of suicide, depression, addiction increased...\n \n What \"individual situation\" could possibly justify that????\n I'm sorry Jyoshu, but deep down you know that they are condemnable.\n You just want to defend the anti-gay to the bitter end...\n \n \n \nBad analogy. Cigarettes have a direct CHEMICAL effect on the body, that casues cancer. You're talking about psychological matters.\n\n emoticon_xdonno\n I thought you were supposed to be writing down the fact that an analogy doesn't have to be perfect to fit the situation.\n \"physical vs psychological\"? Why does that matter to the important attributes of the situation?\n \n I am comparing DOCUMENTED HARM to DOCUMENTED HARM.\n Just because one is a physical harm, and the other is a psychological harm, does not neuter the analogy.\n \n \n \nGoing to a camp that will change their lives and get them out of their comfort zone could always potentially cause depression, or whatever. I've heard cases of kids committing suicide after their parents grounded them.\n\n emoticon_wow\n We aren't talking about kids who were probably already depressed and having problems.\n We're talking about research which CLEARLY QUANTIFIES the effect of \"negative family behavior\", one of which is depriving them of gay peer exposure (which is EXACTLY what would happen at \"ex-gay camp\").\n \n If you want to bring up \"other issues\", then DOCUMENT the other issues in ways similar to what has been done in the original study.\n \n \n \nI guess by your logic parents should never ground their kids for anything.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n The absurdity of your approach.\n This article talked about EIGHT TIMES MORE LIKELY to commit suicide.\n Do you have ANY statistic which shows that a grounded kid is eight times more likely to commit suicide, as compared to non-grounded kids?\n \n Bring me ANYTHING that is on par with that, and then we can talk intelligibly.\n Otherwise, your attempt to mirror my logic just shows how absurdly you fail to comprehend it....\n \n \n \nFoundit. The fact SOME people do this isn't proof that the testimonials aren't real; or that what is accounted in the testimonials can't happen.\n\n This web-site needs a \"smiley\" for banging ones head against the wall.\n I am just astounded you can't comprehend what I am saying.\n I am saying that BOTH things are true.\n \n Tell me Jyoshu. If somebody came to you and told you that they had an architectural solution to fix your culvert problem, and they showed testimonials of others who had tried this fix...\n ... but THEN you also found out that the culvert problem was NOT fixed by what turned out to be a TEMPORARY solution, would you think it a good fix???\n Would you waste your money on it in the first place?\n I guess maybe if the culvert problem were just that big of a problem in the first place, a person might say yes.\n But with \"homosexuality\", does it make sense to send him to a camp, and then 8 months later he's still gay???\n emoticon_xdonno\n \n \n \nFurthermore, that someone 'relapses' doesn't prove it can't work anyway. I suppose people in drug recovery programs should just assume it will never work if they relapse ... \n\n And then, like I pointed out earlier, you have the RESEARCH on the \"reparative therapy\" issue and it's NOT GOOD for the \"reparative therapy\" groups...\n I don't need to \"assume\" anything.\n \n The research PROVES THE HARM.\n It PROVES THE FAILURE.\n \n \n \nFoundit, don't give me that. If you REALLY cared, you'd contact these individuals in the testimonials with an OPEN mind. You don't really want their claims given objective analysis--you passed judgment on their merits WITHOUT ANY analysis!! Looks like you need to take your own advice ...\n\n Jyoshu, if YOU truly cared, you'd contact these individuals in the testimonials with an OPEN mind. You don't really want their claims given objective analysis--you passed judgment on their merits WITHOUT ANY analysis!! Looks like you need to take your own advice ...\n \n \n \nIt IS a controversial issue...\n\n NO.\n The impact upon the \"reparative therapy\" patient is not \"controversial\". It's documented.\n The failures of the ex-gay community are not \"controversial\". They are documented.\n THESE are the real aspects of the conversation that have nothing to do with \"preconceived premises\".\n \n \n \nYet you use the analogy of the drug company and tonic water, which are cases that can also easily be demonstrated. Hypocritical any?\n\n Just out of curiousity, do you make accusations of \"hypocrisy\" without even understanding what the word truly means?\n I whole-heartedly stand behind the analogy of \"tonic water\", cause it often involves somebody trying to convince you that there is something wrong with you and that they have something that can treat it.\n Like with the \"gay\" issue, a LOT of the \"reparative therapy\" groups spend a LOT of money trying to convince gays that there is something wrong with them.\n But in a secular and intelligent approach, the claims LACK EVIDENCE.\n \n \n \nWhere is it proven, Foundit? Your article certainly doesn't PROVE it. Evidence maybe. Proof? Um, no.\n\n emoticon_xdonno\n What exactly do you think is not \"proven\"?\n Please be precise in your claim...\n \n \n \nI know you do. Just as you want to start threads about and against posters, where others can weigh in. It's a consistent problem you have.\n\n And yet again, Jyoshu avoids the fact that he was wrong.\n He simply tries to go for the juvenile \"I know you are but what am I\" approach. emoticon_xdonno\n \n \n \nAgain, parents have to do things ALL THE TIME which are against the child's wishes.\n\n Like what Jyoshu?\n Go to school? Do dishes? Curfew at 9:00?\n Those things have NOTHING to do with changing a FUNDAMENTAL aspect of a person's being.\n What we're talking about is like forcing a kid to have breast augmentation surgery, cause the parents don't like how the kid looks.\n Or, if the kid were to decide he liked the Buddhist beliefs, forcing him to go to a Christian re-programmer to brain-wash him out of his personal beliefs.\n \n Once again, you try to VAGUIFY the issue to try to ignore how petty the anti-gay side is being in all this.\n You're trying to ignore the fact that the parents in question are doing something that will INCREASE HARM to the child. It is NOT in the child's best interests, but at best it's the \"best interests\" of the anti-gay theology they follow....\n \"eight times as likely to have attempted suicide, nearly six times as vulnerable to severe depression and more than three times at risk of drug use\"...\n WHAT do parents do \"ALL THE TIME\" that is anywhere near this type of harm???\n \n \n \nI'm not going to sit here and be in judgment on parents as you are doing, Foundit.\n\n I know you aren't. They're anti-gay Christian parents, and therefore you have no judgment for them.\n But when it comes to the \"gay pride movement\", you're all full of judgment, aintcha...\n \n \n \nYou don't know their individual situations. They are INFINITELY more familiar with their child's life, history, temperament, and psychological health that YOU are.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n We're dealing with a GAY issue Jyoshu.\n Things that a LOT of gay people HAVE LIVED THROUGH.\n \n I would love for you to give some imaginary scenario whereby the \"child's life, history, temperament, and psychological health\" somehow JUSTIFY forcing the kid to go to \"ex-gay camp\", but we both know you can't.\n You're just tossing out some lame defense to try to get people to ignore the situation...",

   "How did your family's story become a movie? We met [producer] Daniel Sladek at a book party in Sebastopol. The fact that it's a TV movie means it's suitable for all viewers. It wouldn't be fruitful if only adults could see it. It's mostly about the validation of young people who are gay and lesbian.\n \n What happened to Bobby and how did it change you? We learned about his gayness through his brother Ed. When we found out, I went the way of my beliefs that God would cure Bobby. It was frightening for me, because even in the '70s it was a deep, dark secret. Bobby thought he'd grow into this horrible creature. It was devastating to me.\n \n Do you think Bobby would have survived if he grew up in a different era? I think he would have survived if he hadn't been in a religious family like ours. I don't mean to knock religion, but my particular religion didn't accept it.\n \n What are your hopes for the movie? I hope young people will take hope, at least to get through that difficult age.\n \n What do you do to keep Bobby's memory alive? I keep up with the latest that's going on for the gay community, doing whatever I can to promote their health and welfare. www.sfexaminer.com << Local News\n \n I am curious if anybody knows of ANY effort from the \"ex-gay\" groups or \"reparative therapy\" groups to help prevent such occurrences.\n They obviously fuel the situation by demonizing gays...\n \"Love the sinner\" would obviously require some effort to try to prevent something that they would HAVE to know about, even if they won't admit it...\n \n Or is it the truth that their cause (in their eyes) is somehow thought of as \"greater\" than the sinner himself?",

   "And while this group is obviously \"gay\", it should be noted that the CITE their claims, based on reports from people who were there at this APA conference. \n\n I should note that Larry Houston's article (the one Jyoshu posted) also quotes a resource who was present at the conference.\n Charles Socarides...\n \n When Socarides statements are offered into evidence, obviously the quality of his \"expertise\" comes into question.\n And like many in the \"reparative therapy\" industry, they have come up with some incredibly embarrassing claims and positions, radical in their absurdity...\n \n \nCharles Socarides and his followers' theories revolve around his belief that \"Homosexuality is based on the fear of the mother, the aggressive attack against the father, and is filled with aggression, destruction and self-deceit\". [Robert Spitzer, quoted in Bayer, p.36] According to Socarides, \"almost half of those who engage in homosexual practices have a concomitant schizophrenia, paranoia, or latent or pseudoneurotic schizophrenia, or are in the throes of a manic-depressive reaction\". [Bayer, page 35]. Socarides developed an elaborate 'cure' based on these theories and claimed a success rate of greater than 50%. [Bayer, p.37]\n \n Interestingly, Charles Socarides was never able to change the sexual orientation of his son, Richard. Richard became a gay rights attorney, worked in the Clinton administration, and went from there to head the corporate communications division of New Line Cinema. \n\n Traditional Values Coalition's Dishonest Re-Writing of APA History\n \n Additionally:\n \nSocarides wrote that male homosexuality typically develops in the first two years of life, during the pre-Oedipal stage of the boy's personality formation. In Socarides's view, it is caused by a controlling mother who prevents her son from separating from her, and a weak or rejecting father who does not serve as a role model for his son or support his efforts to escape from the mother. [8] [9]\n \n Charles Socarides was the father of four children: a son, Richard Socarides, and a daughter, from his first marriage, two children from his second marriage, and one from his fourth marriage, with Claire Alford Socarides. Richard Socarides is openly gay and was Bill Clinton's Senior Advisor for Public Liaison for gay and lesbian issues.[10]\n \n In 1992, Socarides met neuroscientist Simon LeVay, who interviewed him for Born That Way?, a British documentary produced by Jeremy Taylor for Windfall Films. According to LeVay, he asked Socarides what had caused his son Richard to become homosexual. Socarides then, \"...became incensed and said, among other things, \"How would you like it if I asked you about your HIV status?\"\" This part of the interview was excised at Socarides' request. [7]\n \n The Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights group, issued a press release in 1999 saying that NARTH President, Charles Socarides, had \"... run into trouble with the American Psychoanalytic Association (APsaA), of which he is a member. According to a letter from Dr. Ralph Roughton of the APsaA, Socarides misrepresented the position of the APsaA in a published paper and a court affidavit. Socarides attempted to make it appear that the APsaA agrees with his positions on homosexuality. He did this by quoting an APsaA document written in 1968, which supported his views and which he called the \"official position\" of the APsaA, while ignoring a 1990 revised statement that drastically contradicted his views. The Executive Committee of the APsaA instructed the organization's attorney to write a letter to Socarides asking him to cease this misrepresentation and threatening legal action if he continued. Additionally, the APsaA newsletter decided to stop printing advertisements for NARTH meetings because the organization does not adhere to APsaA's policy of non-discrimination and because their activities are demeaning to our members who are gay and lesbian, according to Roughton.\" [11]\n\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Socarides\n \n The absurdity of Socarides' claims belittles his believability as a resource as to what \"pro-gay\" events took place...",

Which begs the question: how do you PROVE A NEGATIVE? There's no data to show Christianity ISN'T a mental illness. That isn't proof Christianity is a mental illness and belongs on the DSM.\n\n \n I think the real issue that many feel has damaged the credibility of the APA isn't so much the single issue of taking homosexuality off the list of 'mental illnesses', but that they have been so active politically for ideological causes and have taken some extremely questionable stances down through the years. Certainly, some would find the removal of homosexuality from DSM to be questionable, but even without that, the organization is not considered objective by any stretch of the imagination by many people, including many psychiatrists. Their tendencies toward political stances and other things bring into question whether they are truly an \"independent\" and \"objective\" organization. The real problem is that the APA has a habit of making obviously-ideologically influenced statements and tends to wade into political issues like gay marriage. For instance, the APA released a statement a few years ago saying that abortion has no negative emotional effects, which is, of course, absurd--many women who have had abortions KNOW this to not be the case. (The APA later pulled that brief, but it should never have been put out in the first place.) \n \n The APA has also taken a political position about being against parental consent in regards to abortions.\n \n Not to mention that, considering these forays into political hot-button issues, it has taken too light a stance on pedophilia, as has its sister organization the American Psychological Association. The irony is that the American Psychiatric Association's removal of homosexuality from DSM in the early 1970s--the supposed \"watershed movment for gays--was not limited to just THAT ...\n \n \"Neatly tucked away inside that agenda was the sub-agenda to legalize pedophilia. The &#8220;1972 Gay Rights Platform in the United States&#8221; called for the &#8220;Repeal of all laws governing the age of sexual consent.&#8221; This platform was endorsed by liberal Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern, who sent a supportive telegram. There were other homosexual organizations, such as the Canadian Lesbian and Gay Rights Coalition and the Gay Alliance Towards Equality, that also opposed the age of consent laws. Their support of the cause would disappear in 1977.\"\n \n It's also well-known that the APA removed pedophilia as a sexual perversion in 1994.\n \n All these examples, from controversial gay-related issues to that of issues regarding abortion indicate a general problem in the APA, to even lack of opposition and even support at times toward such a horrible thing as pedophilia have made a lot of people take the APA with a grain of salt. The result of all this is that many people don't consider the APA to be objective any more.\n \n Here is an excerpt from a letter of resignation from a key person in the APA regarding some of it's major problems in general ...\n \n \"Finally, why must the APA pretend to know more than it does? DSM IV is the fabrication upon which psychiatry seeks acceptance by medicine in general. Insiders know it is more a political than scientific document. To its credit it says so -- although its brief apologia is rarely noted. DSM IV has become a bible and a money making best seller -- its major failings notwithstanding. It confines and defines practice, some take it seriously, others more realistically. It is the way to get paid. Diagnostic reliability is easy to attain for research projects. The issue is what do the categories tell us? Do they in fact accurately represent the person with a problem? They don't, and can't, because there are no external validating criteria for psychiatric diagnoses. There is neither a blood test nor specific anatomic lesions for any major psychiatric disorder. So, where are we? APA as an organization has implicitly (sometimes explicitly as well) bought into a theoretical hoax. Is psychiatry a hoax -- as practiced today? Unfortunately, the answer is mostly yes.\n \n What do I recommend to the organization upon leaving after experiencing three decades of its history?\n \n 1. To begin with, let us be ourselves. Stop taking on unholy alliances without the members' permission.\n 2. Get real about science, politics and money. Label each for what it is -- that is, be honest.\n 3.Get out of bed with NAMI and the drug companies. APA should align itself, if one believes its rhetoric, with the true consumer groups, i.e., the ex-patients, psychiatric survivors etc.\n 4.Talk to the membership -- I can't be alone in my views.\"\n  Resignation from APA",

   "I think the real issue that many feel has damaged the credibility of the APA isn't so much the single issue of taking homosexuality off the list of 'mental illnesses'...\n\n Actually, that issue is beyond reproach.\n Jake was 100% right.\n For anybody who READS the definition of mental illness, homosexuality IS NOT a mental illness. There is NO EVIDENCE that it qualifies as a mental illness.\n The APA questioned whether homosexuality should be on the \"mental illness\" list, saw an absence of evidence showing that it should be, and saw evidence demonstrating gays were found just as normal as straights in a variety of standardized psychological tests.\n \n If you can explain ANY REASON WHY they should have decided differently, then you might have a case.\n But when you present absolutely no evidence that they made the wrong decision, and then criticize them for that decision, you're obviously missing something in the logic department... \n \n \n \nCertainly, some would find the removal of homosexuality from DSM to be questionable, ...\n\n Why?\n \n Both you and Archie love to HINT at questions to that, but you fail to offer up even one argument on the issue.\n WHY should the APA have decided differently?\n \n \n \n...but even without that, the organization is not considered objective by any stretch of the imagination by many people, including many psychiatrists. Their tendencies toward political stances and other things bring into question whether they are truly an \"independent\" and \"objective\" organization. The real problem is that the APA has a habit of making obviously-ideologically influenced statements and tends to wade into political issues like gay marriage.\n\n Jyoshu, just cause they have formed an opinion doesn't mean they are not \"objective\".\n Suppose a religion were to abuse their children. The religion states that it is \"religious freedom\" to do so as their bible demands.\n The APA comes in an states that they should NOT abuse the children.\n \n Now, the truth is that from the MEDICAL and SCIENTIFIC stance they have, which includes preventing harm to people, their opposition to the religious practice is a direct consequence of that oath.\n \n But along comes Jyoshu and declares they are not \"independent\" or \"objective\" cause they are standing in the way of religion doing whatever religion wants to do... :xbanghead\n \n What they are NOT \"objective\" on regards around the oath they take to serve their patients. They want to HELP their patients, and help the mental health of society.\n THAT is their stated position.\n \n Other things that happen as a result of that shouldn't automatically be categorized as \"not objective\" just cause they didn't ignore the tons of stuff that religion does in its blind haste to condemn...\n \n \n \nFor instance, the APA released a statement a few years ago saying that abortion has no negative emotional effects, which is, of course, absurd--many women who have had abortions KNOW this to not be the case. (The APA later pulled that brief, but it should never have been put out in the first place.) \n\n Quite frankly, the cause for your disagreement on the situation is the lack of your awareness on what was REALLY SAID.\n Summing up the APA's position by saying \"no negative emotional effects\" is very inadequate.\n It would be like saying \"no negative emotional effects\" associated with homosexuality. If you LISTEN to the ACTUAL statements, the research shows that OTHER FACTORS (like negative family reaction to the homosexuality) are actually the cause, and there is nothing INHERENT to the homosexuality that causes it.\n \n Regardless, I've opened a thread on that http://www.4forums.com/political/abortion-debates/12287-apa-press-release-abortion.html#post342202 , cause it's entirely non-topical here.\n \n \n \nThe APA has also taken a political position about being against parental consent in regards to abortions.\n\n Again, you fail to recognize what is really going on here.\n YOU PERSONALLY object, with your own non-objective opinion, so you fail to recognize that the APA is looking at it from a MENTAL HEALTH perspective.\n \n Anybody evaluating the situation AS A WHOLE should obviously take into account all relevant factors, including \"mental health\".\n \n Quite frankly, your position seems to come off more like a doctor who feels a patient should take antibiotics \"is not objective\" on the subject of antibiotics. The truth is that WEIGHING THE DATA based on the criteria established and COMING TO A CONCLUSION does not automatically make one \"not objective\".\n Judges are supposed to objectively apply the law all the time. Doesn't mean that sending somebody to jail makes them non-objective.\n \n \n \nNot to mention that, considering these forays into political hot-button issues, it has taken too light a stance on pedophilia, as has its sister organization the American Psychological Association. The irony is that the American Psychiatric Association's removal of homosexuality from DSM in the early 1970s--the supposed \"watershed movment for gays--was not limited to just THAT ...\n\n Yeah. You obviously are intent on relying on misrepresentations and failing to recognize what is REALLY going on. You IGNORE what the group is ACTUALLY saying, skip the part where you try to realize WHY they are saying it, and rush to declaring them \"not objective\" because they said something that is mirepresented as something else.\n \n Furthermore, what you now quote has nothing to do with the APA, so I'm not going to bother to requote that trash.\n The fact that you have to dig back to 1972, to quote something which gays unilaterally reject these days, only demonstrates the desparation of your position.\n Perhaps I should go back a few decades and quote EVANGELICALS on their opinions on segregation, and proclaim that somehow means something???\n \n \n \nIt's also well-known that the APA removed pedophilia as a sexual perversion in 1994.\n\n I have to laugh, cause you are making less and less sense.\n The APA DOES NOT CLASSIFY \"sexual perversions\". It has classifications for \"mental illness\". It has classifications for \"paraphilia\".\n Jyoshu, can you show me the APA list of \"sexual perversions\"???\n \n Naw. Didn't think so.\n What your post is truly showing is how somebody with no clue as to how the purpose or function of the APA can criticize it with demonstrable absence of knowledge...\n \n \n \nHere is an excerpt from a letter of resignation from a key person in the APA regarding some of it's major problems in general ...\n \n \"Finally, why must the APA pretend to know more than it does?

I'm sure the APA considered itself objective in 1972 and in 1994 too. You use these terms like \"objective\", but the REASON you consider their decision \"objective\" is really because it's what you want to hear. It's not like you can just say \"oh, they weren't REALLY objective THEN.\" No, they thought they were objective then just as they assume they are NOW.

The issue is whether or not such a politically and ideologically active group like the APA even has credibility to begin with. Many don't think so, and for good reason.\n\n Many may \"think so\", but not for \"good reason\".\n They think so for their own idealogical purposes. A convenient attempt to reduce the reality of the opposition, by \"bringing them down\" to their level.\n \n Time and time again, when the anti-gay side has JUST their opinion, they routinely try (falsely) to claim that the other side is just an \"opinion\" as well when the truth is that it involves a matter of fact.\n Now before the misrepresentation can occur, I am not saying that every \"pro-gay\" item is a matter of fact.\n What I am saying is that when somebody on the \"anti-gay\" side of the aisle tries to say that homosexuality is a choice (that issue involves a fact situation), and tries to claim that the opposing factual situation is just \"opinion\", that is an attempt to bring the perceived pro-gay position down to the anti-gay level.\n \n Here, when the anti-gay side lacks objectivity, they try to accuse objective organizations of being \"pro-gay\" just because the organization has said something that opposes the anti-gay position.\n That's a bit like claiming \"the earth revolves around the sun is a religious belief\", just because some religious people can't fathom their religious position being just plain wrong.\n \n \n \nNo, if you read the article, you'd see there was NO scientific basis behind this descision--it was a political take-over, basically. \n \" .... not as a result of valid scientific studies.\"\n In other words, it wasn't a case of people weighing the evidence and going a certain way because there was a lack of evidence or evidence pointed in a certain direction.\n\n \"if I read the article\" being the keywords (and I did read the article)\n What you don't seem to grasp is that Socarides IS NOT TELLING THE TRUTH. \"valid scientific studies\" WERE presented.\n Dr Hooker's studies were presented, for one.\n \n The problem is that you're relying on the misinformation of the anti-gay side. And \"misinformation\" IS REPETITIVE in your whole approach!\n Over and OVER and OVER again, you present things which are just plain not true as \"evidence\" of the APA's supposed \"lack of objectivity\".\n \n \n \nBut the funny thing is--and really, this is the POINT--how you arbitrarily label any descision on their part as \"objective\" and assume it was made via an objective process only when the decision fits what you want it to be.\n\n Quite frankly, you've lost sight of the MEANING of the word objective, in addition to your accusation being false.\n I have no doubt that some of my statements are not \"objective\".

It means they've taken sides.\n\n And this is where you don't get it.\n They talk about the PSYCHOLOGICAL position.\n \n From a PARENTAL RIGHTS position, an entirely different conclusion can be reached.\n Did the APA say \"this psychological evaluation trumps parental right concerns in the big picture\"?\n I don't see that.\n They spoke on THEIR EXPERTISE, which was the PSYCHOLOGICAL impact.\n \n I seriously don't think you or others appreciate how this whole thing plays out...\n Take rape for example. Very wrong. I don't think there is any real dispute on that.\n However, are rapists \"mentally ill\"? Are serial rapists \"mentally ill\"?\n Just cause we don't like it doesn't mean they are \"mentally ill\".\n Just because a psychologist says \"this man who has raped 5 women is not mentally ill\", does not mean the rapist shouldn't go to jail.\n \n \n \nTo even claim it's in the best interests of \"mental health\" is TO TAKE a political ideological position on these issues. \n\n That's absurd. It only demonstrates your own lack of objectivity.\n What you fail to recognize is \"best interests of mental health\" doesn't mean it's the ONLY interest, or the TRUMPING interest involved.\n Going to prison could possibly be classified as not in the \"best interests of mental health\" for a variety of prisoners. But OTHER FACTORS can easily outweigh the \"mental health\" aspect. \n \n \n \n(One has to wonder how exactly it's more helpful from a mental health perspective for kids to keep their parents out of decision to abort their babies, anyway.)\n\n One \"wonders\" that, and if the APA determines something contrary to what you want it to be, that makes them \"not objective\"...\n \n \n \nIf that's true , then all that needs to be changed is the reaction. The individual factors need to be changed then, and it's therefore ok to go on ahead and maintain religious objection to the ACT of homosexuality.\n\n IMO, I have no problem with people having religious OPINION against the act of homosexuality\", while controlling the reaction (like you say), and that being \"ok\".\n Part of the problem is getting people to RECOGNIZE the impact of the existing \"reactions\".\n That, and people trying to pass off their \"objections\" as benign, when in a lot of cases they aren't.\n \n For example, The article documented harm in denying gay kids access to gay peers.\n Do you get the significance of that?\n Or are you more along the lines of wanting to SUPPORT a religious parent from preventing a gay kid from having access to gay peers?\n \n \n \nSee, no one here is arguing that being emotionally negative toward kids is ok. The REAL problem here is that you (and the APA) basically puts ANY objection to gay relationships in the category of \"negative emotional effect.\"\n\n No. The REAL problem is that you refuse to accurately assess our positions.\n The previous APA article. Can you show where it says \"ANY objection to gay relationship\"?\n No. You can't. Those are words you have chosen to insert into there.\n \n Can you show where I have done that?\n No. It's just your misrepresentation because it is my position that SOME FORMS of \"objection\" do have \"negative emotional effect\".\n Not \"any\".\n \n \n \nNo, it's topical here, and this is where I will discuss it. This is no debate about abortion. These examples show the problems with the APA, which pertains to gay-related issues, since gay pride advocates often invoke statements by the APA. To question claims of their objectivity with examples of NON-objectivity is ENTIRELY on topic.\n\n I see this easily devolving into a debate on abortion.\n My post on the abortion page was concise and to a point.\n Your claims regarding what the APA has said are FALSE. The article I quoted explicitly explains the boundaries of the claims, which you ignore and rephrase to be more extravagent.\n \n Do you want me to repost the APA article here?\n Or are you going to respond to the misrepresentation you have demonstrated without me wasting another post?\n \n \n \nI never claimed *I* was being \"objective\" here--the point is that the APA isn't being objective, nor are you in your defense of the APA.\n\n CLAFCLOW.\n I never said anything about you claiming you were or weren't objective.\n I was pointing to the REAL cause of your conclusion that \"APA isn't being objective\".\n \n \n \nAnd evaluating is AS A WHOLE is exactly what I'm trying to get YOU to do. I think it's YOU who are giving the APA a pretty much free pass here, and not taking everything into account. \n\n AGAIN, you're not listening to what I'm saying.\n One of the reasons you think the APA is not objective is because you fail to appreciate the TRUE FOCUS of the organization involved.\n \n Take lawyers for example. Lawyers are supposed to give a vigorous defense of their client. Period.\n That doesn't mean that a defense lawyer thinks the law shouldn't be applied.\n With the APA< their interests are in the mental health of their patient. So if the study involved doesn't show negative abortion effects on the mental health, they report that.\n \n \n \nSaaay whaaaa???\n Who has tried to prove ALL OF GAYS are a hoax here?? You were asking about the APA.\n\n Yeah.\n And as such, one would think I was going to apply that to the APA instead of \"all of gays\" like you jumped to.\n A disgruntled APA member and your misrepresentations of the APA, refusing to appreciate their focus, does not mean they aren't \"objective\".\n \n \n \nA more relevant analogy would be if a LOT of people--some of them having LEFT a Christian organization--published letters pointing out numerous problems with THAT ORGANIZATION.\n\n And your documentation of that is where?\n And with any such documentation, are you also capable of showing that they didn't leave because the INDIVIDUALS were not objective, and they just refused to be a part of an organization which didn't share their lack of objectiveness?\n \n \n \nAnd you and I both know (though you'd never admit it) that you'd be jumping on board with such letters if they were toward a Church or Christian organization--particularly if they were pertaining to some organization that had anything to do with taking a stance of helping people who want to stop being in gay relationships. emoticon_rolleyes Suddenly, you'd be a WHOLE lot more interested in so-called \"disgruntled\" peoples' letters .... ;)\n\n Over and over again, you're just plain wrong about me.\n There are PLENTY of religious people, who are \"ex-Christians\", I could talk about.

A convenient attempt to reduce the reality of the opposition, by \"bringing them down\" to their level.\n\n \n I've just shown you the history behind this; how the APA delves into political issues regularly. When a group lobbies for a POLITICAL issue, they ARE doing it for ideological purposes. There's no way around that. Your whole position here is one of begging the question, in that you assume THEIR political positions are valid. It's like saying any gay rights organization is valid in their position--well of course you're going to say that! You're arguing that side.\n \n \nWhat I am saying is that when somebody on the \"anti-gay\" side of the aisle tries to say that homosexuality is a choice\n\n \n That's not what we're talking about here though. Saying kids shouldn't have to get parental consent to abort babies isn't based on \"fact\". Taking a position that marriage should be redefined isn't a based on \"fact.\" EVERYBODY thinks the facts are on their side, Foundit. You're begging the question here, big time.\n \n The 14th amendment equality is an OBJECTIVE standard. It doesn't stop being \"objective\" just cause you don't like what it means...[/quote]\n \n No it's not. If it were, and the ways you try to apply the 14th to gay rights were applied to everything, marriage would have to be opened up to anything that comes along--there could be no boundaries on ANYTHING. Quite frankly, one of the key indicators that something is subjective is that there tends to be enormous controversy that surround such issues. That's because it CAN go either way, depending on one's POV. That's exactly WHY there are controversial issues out there.\n \n \nProve your 1994 claim.\n\n \n http://www.drjudithreisman.com/archives/2005/08/implications_of.html\n \"In its 1994 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV (DSM-IV), the American Psychiatric Association removed pedophilia as a sexual perversion.\"\n \n \nYou do not like what their conclusion is, so you automatically label it as \"pro-choice position\".\n\n \n Well yes. Remember, you're the one trying to claim the APA is objective. I'm not trying to claim I've being objective, necessarily.\n \n \nAnd if you looked at the other \"abortion\" thread, you'd see me expose your claims regarding the APA's abortion position AS FALSE.\n\n \n I see no such 'exposing' at all. Feel free to link to it if you really think you did. The APA statements are completely verifiable.\n \n \nAnd this is where you don't get it.\n They talk about the PSYCHOLOGICAL position. From a PARENTAL RIGHTS position, an entirely different conclusion can be reached.\n\n \n No, you aren't getting it. Making a statement on the PSYCHOLOGICAL issue of it is one thing. But they went farther than that and crossed a LINE when they take a position of OPPOSING laws that requires parental consent. They lose the \"right\"--so to speak--to be able to seriously say they are being \"objective\" at that point. That their reasons were because of the PSYCHOLOGICAL aspect is not relevant--the point is that they shouldn't have waded into the POLITICAL arena at all.\n \n \nI seriously don't think you or others appreciate how this whole thing plays out...Take rape for example. Very wrong. I don't think there is any real dispute on that.However, are rapists \"mentally ill\"? Are serial rapists \"mentally ill\"?\n\n \n Actually, this is a great example. It would be like someone saying we should make rape LEGAL because they aren't mentally ill.\n \n \nPart of the problem is getting people to RECOGNIZE the impact of the existing \"reactions\".\n\n \n I think most people ARE aware of those 'impacts'. It becomes a matter of having to take a stand for what they believe is right. No one ever said standing up for what one believes is right doesn't have impacts, even if those can be negative in some cases. \n \n What should be done is allow objection AND work toward stopping those impacts. The way to prevent them shouldn't be to stop objections. As an analogy, if someone says we should stop damaging the environment, and then someone goes out and kills someone for littering, that issue needs to be dealt with by saying that people shouldn't be killing other people. NOT by saying we should stop saying it's bad to damage the environment. \n \n \nThat, and people trying to pass off their \"objections\" as benign, when in a lot of cases they aren't.\n\n \n Sure, we can never know if someone's intentions are really good or not, re. much of anything, can we?",

As you pointed out, her education IS in communications.\n \n Furthermore...\n \nIn the early 1980s \"the US Justice Department had given Reisman a grant for $734,371 to study pictures in Playboy, Penthouse, and Hustler.\" [ 3 ] Reisman used the grant to confirm her conclusion of \"Kinsey's role in child sexual abuse and the link to children appearing in mainstream pornography...\" [ 4 ] Dr. Reisman pored over thousands of pages of pornographic literature. She felt herself persecuted at every turn and complained of a conspiracy to derail her efforts, going so far as to blame the Kinsey Institute for her inability to get published by a legitimate publishing house. [ 5 ]\n \n And to an extent, she was persecuted, though not for the reasons she assumed. The Reagan-appointee who had commissioned the study, Alfred Regnery (the head of a conservative publishing house), admitted he had been wrong to do so. Avedon Carol writes:\n It was a scientific disaster, riddled with researcher bias and baseless assumptions. The American University (AU), where Reisman's study had been academically based, actually refused to publish it when she released it, after their independent academic auditor reported on it. Dr Robert Figlio of the University of Pennsylvania told AU that, 'The term child used in the aggregate sense in this report is so inclusive and general as to be meaningless.' Figlio told the press, 'I wondered what kind of mind would consider the love scene from Romeo and Juliet to be child porn'. (Carol, 1994, p.116) [6] \n Dr Loretta Haroian, the cochair of the plenary session of Child and Adolescent Sexuality at the 1984 World Congress of Sexology, an expert on childhood sexuality, was quoted as saying of Reisman,\n  This is not science, it's vigilantism: paranoid, pseudoscientific hyperbole with a thinly veiled hidden agenda. This kind of thing doesn't help children at all. ... Her [Reisman's] study demonstrates gross negligence and, while she seems to have spent a lot of time collecting her data, her conclusions, based on the data, are completely unwarranted. The experts Reisman cites are, in fact, not experts at all but simply people who have chosen to adopt some misinformed, Disneyland conception of childhood that she has. These people are little more than censors hiding behind Christ and children.\" (Carol, 1994, p.116). [7]\n There were difficulties in publishing the study, though Reisman tends to gloss over this fact as illustrated in the case of The State of Ohio vs. the Contemporary Art Center and Dennis Barrie (Mapplethorpe and Cincinnati). Dr. Reisman was called to testify as an expert witness.\n  Mezibov, the defense attorney \"asks if [Reisman's] study has been published by the Justice Department. 'It is on the shelf. It was published. You can buy copies.' A series of truths, not adding up to the truth.\n \n \"Mezibov pulls out the pretrial testimony. 'You said before that there was a six-year delay, that the study was published not by the Justice Department but by Huntington Press. Would you like to change your answer?'\" [8]\n\n Judith Reisman Versus Alfred Kinsey, Homosexuality, and Porn\n \n She has even accused Kinsey of being a pedophile. She has no basis for this claim, but I doubt that troubles her much...\n Judith A.

   "I've just shown you the history behind this; how the APA delves into political issues regularly.\n\n Jyoshu, FACTS are involved in \"political issues regularly\".\n That doesn't make FACTS somehow \"biased\".\n \n Some people want to know whether or not a person who has an abortion is harmed by the abortion. Others want to know if \"homosexuality\" is a \"mental illness\".\n Just because the APA can answer these questions DOES NOT make them \"biased\".\n \n And the \"history\" you have shown has been exposed as being false. Regarding the \"homosexuality\" issue, Socarides was repeating something he should have known was a falsehood. He was either blatantly lying, or suffering some mental illness that caused him to believe a delusion.\n Neither are good for a \"credibility\" stand-point.\n \n Regarding abortion, I HAVE POSTED the APA's actual statements and positions.\n YOU need to substantiate your CLAIMS on what the APA has said, and please do so quoting the APA THEMSELVES, cause you have a recurring trend of quoting people who are stating falsehoods who are making claims about what the APA is doing...\n \n \n \nWhen a group lobbies for a POLITICAL issue, they ARE doing it for ideological purposes. There's no way around that.\n\n And I have explained the ACTUAL ideology involved.\n Their interests for their PATIENT'S HEALTH.\n YES. Doctors are \"biased\" in the interests of their PATIENTS' HEALTH.\n \n \n \nYour whole position here is one of begging the question, in that you assume THEIR political positions are valid. It's like saying any gay rights organization is valid in their position--well of course you're going to say that! You're arguing that side.\n\n Jyoshu, quit trying to move the goal-posts.\n I am stating that the APA is a credible resource on psychiatric issues, and they are not \"biased\".\n \n \n \nThat's not what we're talking about here though. Saying kids shouldn't have to get parental consent to abort babies isn't based on \"fact\".\n\n You keep stripping these discussions of important aspects.\n Whether or not kids are psychologically harmed by an absence of having parental consent is an issue OF FACT.\n THAT is what their statement is on.\n \n You want to look at it from a bigger picture, and you are taking shots at anybody who is concluding differently, REFUSING TO RECOGNIZE THE CONTEXT of what their evaluation is based on.\n \n \n \nTaking a position that marriage should be redefined isn't a based on \"fact.\" EVERYBODY thinks the facts are on their side, Foundit. You're begging the question here, big time.\n\n I am refusing to allow you to rephrase what the APA has said, much like I refuse to allow you to rephrase what myself or other pro-gay posters have said.\n \n \n \nThe 14th amendment equality is an OBJECTIVE standard. It doesn't stop being \"objective\" just cause you don't like what it means...\n\n \nNo it's not. If it were, and the ways you try to apply the 14th to gay rights were applied to everything, marriage would have to be opened up to anything that comes along--there could be no boundaries on ANYTHING.\n\n That's a false claim.\n The existence of boundaries does not mean that something is not objective.\n If the ride at the amusement park demands 5'6\", does that mean that the standard is somehow \"not objective\"?\n \n You keep making up absurd positions to try to justify an initial absurd pretense.\n \n \n \nQuite frankly, one of the key indicators that something is subjective is that there tends to be enormous controversy that surround such issues. That's because it CAN go either way, depending on one's POV. That's exactly WHY there are controversial issues out there.\n\n There you go again. Trying to make \"controversy\" somehow a super-justifier of goals you desire.\n The claim that the earth rotated around the sun was \"controversial\".\n But the OBSERVATION ITSELF is not \"subjective\".\n It's purely OBJECTIVE that some people apply their subjective opinions to.\n \n Just because controversy exists does not mean the issue doesn't involve objective facts.\n \n \n \nYou do not like what their conclusion is, so you automatically label it as \"pro-choice position\".\n\n \nWell yes. Remember, you're the one trying to claim the APA is objective. I'm not trying to claim I've being objective, necessarily.\n\n Talk about trying to move the goal-posts...\n I am pointing to the real reason YOU think that the APA is not objective.\n YOUR view is subjectively skewed, so you pretend that another person's objectivity is lacking.\n \n Go back to the court analogy. The defendant and the plaintiff are obviously NOT objective.\n But the JUDGE IS to be objective in reaching a conclusion.\n \"Controversy\" may exist, but that doesn't mean the judge doesn't OBJECTIVELY come to a ruling.\n \n The point is that YOUR SUBJECTIVITY is the real reason for trying to pretend the APA is not objective.\n \n \n \nI see no such 'exposing' at all. Feel free to link to it if you really think you did. The APA statements are completely verifiable.\n\n And to date, you have failed to \"verify\" them.\n You have refused to address where I pointed out your claims as fallacious.\n Fine. I challenge you to prove your claims WITH THE APA'S WORDS.\n \n \n \nNo, you aren't getting it. Making a statement on the PSYCHOLOGICAL issue of it is one thing. But they went farther than that and crossed a LINE when they take a position of OPPOSING laws that requires parental consent.\n\n Quote them.\n \n \n \nActually, this is a great example. It would be like someone saying we should make rape LEGAL because they aren't mentally ill.\n\n emoticon_xdonno\n :xbanghead\n And the key part of that analogy is that the APA IS NOT MAKING that claim.\n Take your false \"APA / pedophilia\" claim from BLOWI Reisman.\n The APA has made it clear in its statements that EVEN IF they were to declare pedophilia as \"not a mental illness\", that WOULD NOT MEAN that it should not be illegal.\n \n You and your side fail to recognize a lot of things.\n One thing I have found historically amusing is the pretense that homosexuality is BOTH a mental illness, AND a choice. Do people CHOOSE to be mentally ill? No. emoticon_frazzled\n You guys DO NOT THINK SUBJECTIVELY, and ergo you try to insinuate that others who don't reach your conclusions must be failing to think subjectively.\n Trying to pull others down to your level....\n \n \n \nI think most people ARE aware of those 'impacts'.\n\n Somehow, this claim is ridiculously shallow when people argue about what those \"impacts\" actually are...\n Just look at the PFOX, ex-gay, and reparative therapy reactions to the \"negative family behavior\" study. These \"ex-gay\" guys are \"aware\" of what they WANT these \"impacts\" to be presented as.\n \n \n \nIt becomes a matter of having to take a stand for what they believe is right. No one ever said standing up for what one believes is right doesn't have impacts, even if those can be negative in some cases.\n\n I guess it's just that much easier when it's the gays who are experiencing the \"negatives\"...\n \n \n \nWhat should be done is allow objection AND work toward stopping those impacts.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n You know jyoshu, you have repeatedly let it be known that preventing anti-gay lies or slurs, or fighting against anti-gay discrimination is not your thing...\n So excuse me while I find your \"what should be done\" as incredibly shallow and selfish...\n \n \n \nThe way to prevent them shouldn't be to stop objections.\n\n Again, I tire of the vague attempts at pretending theory legitimacy when in application reality, it's shallow complaints.\n 1) WHO is arguing to \"stop objections\"?\n 2) HOW do you supposedly \"prevent\" the negative consequences upon gays regarding the \"objections\"?\n For example, with the \"negative family behavior\" study, this is a PSYCHOLOGICAL reaction.\n You apparently don't want the \"negative family behavior\" thing to change.\n SO I guess the question now is, in your mind, how do you make gay kids react better when their family reacts badly to them being gay?\n \n I mean, I realize gays are obviously inconveniencing you and your religion in our psychological problems, so how can we help to make it so it's easier on you...\n emoticon_frazzled\n < end sarcasm <\n \n \n \nAs an analogy, if someone says we should stop damaging the environment, and then someone goes out and kills someone for littering, that issue needs to be dealt with by saying that people shouldn't be killing other people. NOT by saying we should stop saying it's bad to damage the environment.\n\n To further that analogy, you have already stated that \"gay\" issues are not your fight.\n Utilizing the analogy, you are refusing to oppose someone who \"kills someone for littering\"...\n Refusing to criticize them... \n \n \n \nThat, and people trying to pass off their \"objections\" as benign, when in a lot of cases they aren't.\n\n \nSure, we can never know if someone's intentions are really good or not, re. much of anything, can we?\n\n LOL!\n I can pretty much count on how you are going to interpret things conveniently for the \"Christian\" side of things...\n When I said \"benign\", I was talking about the CONSEQUENCES of the \"objections\".\n But of course, you focus on the \"intentions\" of the objections.\n So I guess it matters less if a gay child is harmed, if the \"intent\" of the parent harming the gay child is \"in the right place\" ??? emoticon_ic",

   "You have been challenged to QUOTE the APA's actual statements\n \n Quote the APA's statements.\n\n Same-Sex Marriage Stance: American Psychiatric Association\n \n The American Psychiatric Association adopted the following position statement at its May 2005 meeting: \"The American Psychiatric Association supports the legal recognition of same sex civil marriage. Heterosexual relationships have a legal framework for their existence through civil marriage. Same sex couples therefore experience several kinds of state-sanctioned discrimination that can adversely affect the stability of their relationships and mental health.\" \n \n On Same-Sex Unions\n The American Psychiatric Association adopted the following position statement at its November 2000 meeting: \"The American Psychiatric Association supports the legal recognition of same sex unions and their associated legal rights, benefits and responsibilities.\"\n \n HRC | Same-Sex Marriage Stance: American Psychiatric Association\n\n \n \nThe APA position statement on abortion states, \n The American Psychiatric Association 1) opposes all constitutional amendments, legislation, and \n regulations curtailing family planning and abortion services to any segment of the population; 2) \n reaffirms its position that abortion is a medical procedure in which physicians should respect the \n patient's right to freedom of choice&#8212;psychiatrists may be called on as consultants to the patient or \n physician in those cases in which the patient or physician requests such consultation to expand \n mutual appreciation of motivation and consequences; and 3) affirms that the freedom to act to \n interrupt pregnancy must be considered a mental health imperative with major social and mental \n health implications. \n \n archive.psych.org/edu/other_res/lib_archives/archives/199113.pdf\n\n \n \nGun Control ...\n \n \" &#8226; Expand the Brady background checks to gun shows.\n Current law makes the purchase and/or have possession of weapons by certain classes of people illegal. While gun dealers with Federal Firearms Licenses (FFLs) are required to conduct background checks prior to a sale, other sellers are not required to do so. As a result proscribed persons can still purchase weapons from them without impediment. By uniformly requiring a background check for the commercial sale of firearms, we can reduce inappropriate sales and decrease the risk of handgun injuries. \n \n &#8226; Support a limitation on the number of guns that can be purchased during a given time period.\n Diversion of weapons from the legal market to a secondary market, where criminals and other unauthorized persons can purchase them, contributes to handgun misuse and injury. Limitations on volume purchases can prevent straw purchases (the lawful procurement of firearms by an authorized individual with the intent to sell them to unauthorized persons), thereby reducing the number of criminals and proscribed persons with guns and, as a result, diminish the number of handgun injuries.\n \n &#8226; Restore the waiting period between the time an individual purchases a weapon and the time s/he takes possession of it.\n Data demonstrate that both homicide and suicide are often \"acts of passion\" and if the means to commit the act are not immediately available, the passion may ebb and death and injury may be avoided. \"\n \n 200107\nThere you go; 3 MAJOR examples of evidence of the APA delving into political issues, and therefore taking ideological stances. Would you like more proof of these things that are common knowledge for people who follow these sort of issues? emoticon_rolleyes Because there are plenty, regarding a PLETHORA of political issues. And just so you can't start your \"character assassination\" tactics, I used only sources that would be very hard for you to attempt to discredit. (Like HRC, and the APA itself)\n \n I am having to do some searching for the citation on the parental consent issue and will post it when I find it; I have seen the claim made in a number of places, and not just on \"conservative\" sites. \n \n\"Medical and public health organizations that oppose forced parental involvement for minors seeking contraceptives include the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Medical Women&#8217;s Association, and the Society of Adolescent Medicine. When HHS attempted to require parental notification for Title X contraceptive services in 1981, the American Medical Association and the American Psychiatric Association opposed the regulations and supported confidentiality for adolescents.\"\n \n Forced Parental Involvement Defeats the Goals of the Title X Program | Center for Reproductive Rights\n\n (\"Forced parental involvement\" is a liberal-biased way of referring to requiring parental consent, BTW)\n \n At this point, anyone who would still be clinging to the idea that the APA is truly an \"objective\" and \"independent\" organization--given the MOUNTAIN of evidence of political stances, lobbying, ideological side-taking, etc. is just deluding themselves.",

   "\"Although many clinical research studies have shown that gays and lesbians are less psychologically healthy than heterosexuals, the mental health associations simply dismiss the research, saying instead that the psychological problems of homosexuals are due to society&#8217;s homophobia. Critics of the resolutions supporting gay marriage say that the APA and the American Psychiatric Association should openly define what they mean by \"healthy sexuality,\" \"healthy development,\" and \"healthy families,\" and explain how their statements have anything to do with mental health. The irony of the issue is that the mental health associations have the unfair advantage of referring to themselves as objective \"scientific\" organizations, yet their resolutions are based on recommendations from association members with clearly defined philosophical and political agendas that have nothing to do with science. So, to many people, such so-called \"clinically objective\" endorsements seem, well, pretty insane.\" American Psychiatric Association Supports Legalizing Gay Marriage\n \n Sums up the problem quite well ...\n\n \n Your reference is quoting NARTH. This is another crackpot group who defines homosexuality as an illness to be cured. Enough said. You got NARTH and Reisman, 2 for 2. Way to be scholarly. If you weren't just grasping for any old crapp that supports your ill-founded opinion, you would not have chosen those 2 references.\n \n \n Promotion of political ideas that will improve mental health is not a diversion from the mission. If marriage is good for the mental health of straights, it is good for gays. The American Academy of Pediatrics wrote an elegant position paper in favor of gay marriage, because, there is good evidence that the stability of marriage is better for kids, and gay folks have kids. Are pediatricians also suspect in your mind? Other medical associations lobby for health care reform, Medicare legislation, etc.\n \n If medical organizations are \"biased\" in favor of ideas that promote the health of those they are supposed to serve, I think that's OK. You are confusing a political position (having to do with government and its citizens) and ideology. Having scientific studies to back up an opinion is, well, the opposite of acting purely out of ideology.\n \n Also, the statement \" many clinical research studies have shown that gays and lesbians are less psychologically healthy than heterosexuals,...\" is simply false. If you subscribe to that opinion yourself, you are the biased one. The facts clearly contradict that. \n \n Again this is a non-issue except to you. Why the APA?? Why not the American College of Gynecologists? What opinion do you have on all the other medical organizations? Could it be that this one organization holds a position you do not like?

   "Reisman demonstrated her failure in objectivity in the Porn study. SHE is an idealogue with no training in the psychiatric field, who is trying to score political points. This is ESPECIALLY evidenced by her almost exclusive political involvement.\n\n \n \nJudith Reisman was recently quoted in the Sunday Los Angeles Times as one of Alfred Kinsey's chief detractors. Indeed, she has made a career out of trying to discredit Kinsey, a career which we will review here. Reisman's work would be of little consequence were she not referenced by so many conservative Christian organizations, from the Family Research Council, to James Dobson's Focus on the Family, to Beverly LaHaye's Concerned Women of America.\n \n In the 1970s Judith Reisman was a singer on the Captain Kangaroo show. The chanteuse's career ended badly when the free-agent singer-songwriter ran headlong into modern market research and the crushing competition of what she later referred to as \"the fast-action and increasing violence of cartoons on other stations.\" Retreating under the cover of artistic integrity she turned to academia, and a career in communications and media analysis. The fact that children's minds wandered during her music videos had to be about something other than the quality of her performance, and she was going to find out what it was.\n \n Enter Alfred Kinsey: Reisman's personal scapegoat.\n \n The move from kid's show celebrity to academia was not an easy one for Reisman. Intimidated by her husband, a university professor, and his colleagues, she reinvented herself as a doctor of communications, expert on pornography, and token Jewish friend of the American conservative religious right. In her Personal Odyssey she writes that the academicians she met were \"...out of touch with the reality of the majority.\"\n \n Dr. Reisman began writing extensively on Dr. Alfred Kinsey. Her first book was self-published, by her occasionally defunct Institute for Media Education, of which whe is President. Her second Kinsey book, and another on pornography were published by Huntington House Books. Huntington House, along with its subsidiary Vital Issues Press, will publish almost any book on \"conservative issues, politically incorrect expos\u00e9s, christian apologetics, cults/occult, evangelism, family issues, anti-globalist issues\" and \"patriotism/survivalism\" as it says in its appeal to prospective authors.\n \n [snip]\n \n Type Judith Reisman into the Amazon search engine and you'll see a display of out-of-print and yet-to-be-printed (World Net Daily Publishing) mentions. You can still dig up some of her books used. The obscurity of her work has not prevented her from becoming a regular writer for the right wing rag World Net Daily.\n \n QUESTIONING REALITY\n The online-only Journal of Human Sexuality, sponsored by Leadership U (a spinoff of Campus Crusade for Christ), has published Reisman's essay, Kinsey and the Homosexual Revolution. The essay is comprised of 31 complex and leading questions, questions designed to prejudice the reader, questions like \"...what if all of Kinsey's work was fraudulent, or worse?\", and \"...could not some American scientists teach pederasts and pedophiles techniques for sexually abusing children for 'science'?\", and \"Was Kinsey himself a closet homosexual, pedophile or pederast?\"\n \n The answer to these questions is \"no,\" which is why they're posed as questions and not as statements. Though Dr. Reisman includes tables and footnotes, she offers no proof or support for the innuendo she directs at Kinsey. In fact, her \"research methods\" could call her own background into question.\n \n [snip]\n \n THE PORN STUDY\n In the early 1980s \"the US Justice Department had given Reisman a grant for $734,371 to study pictures in Playboy, Penthouse, and Hustler.\" [ 3 ] Reisman used the grant to confirm her conclusion of \"Kinsey's role in child sexual abuse and the link to children appearing in mainstream pornography...\" [ 4 ] Dr. Reisman poured over thousands of pages of pornographic literature. She felt herself persecuted at every turn and complained of a conspiracy to derail her efforts, going so far as to blame the Kinsey Institute for her inability to get published by a legitimate publishing house.\n \n And to an extent, she was persecuted, though not for the reasons she assumed. The Reagan-appointee who had commissioned the study, Alfred Regnery (the head of the conservative publishing house, Regnery Press), admitted he had been wrong to do so. Avedon Carol writes: \n It was a scientific disaster, riddled with researcher bias and baseless assumptions. The American University (AU), where Reisman's study had been academically based, actually refused to publish it when she released it, after their independent academic auditor reported on it. Dr Robert Figlio of the University of Pennsylvania told AU that, 'The term child used in the aggregate sense in this report is so inclusive and general as to be meaningless.' Figlio told the press, 'I wondered what kind of mind would consider the love scene from Romeo and Juliet to be child porn'. (Carol, 1994, p.116)\n Dr Loretta Haroian, the cochair of the plenary session of Child and Adolescent Sexuality at the 1984 World Congress of Sexology, an expert on childhood sexuality, commented on Reisman's work,\n This is not science, it's vigilantism: paranoid, pseudoscientific hyperbole with a thinly veiled hidden agenda. This kind of thing doesn't help children at all. ... [Reisman's] study demonstrates gross negligence and, while she seems to have spent a lot of time collecting her data, her conclusions, based on the data, are completely unwarranted. The experts Reisman cites are, in fact, not experts at all but simply people who have chosen to adopt some misinformed, Disneyland conception of childhood that she has. These people are little more than censors hiding behind Christ and children.\" (Carol, 1994, p.116). [ 7 ]\n There were difficulties in publishing the study, though Reisman tends to gloss over this fact as illustrated in the case of The State of Ohio vs. the Contemporary Art Center and Dennis Barrie (Mapplethorpe and Cincinnati). Dr. Reisman was called to testify as an expert witness. \n \n Mezibov, the defense attorney \"asks if [Reisman's] study has been published by the Justice Department. 'It is on the shelf. It was published. You can buy copies.' A series of truths, not adding up to the truth.\n \"Mezibov pulls out the pretrial testimony. 'You said before that there was a six-year delay, that the study was published not by the Justice Department but by Huntington Press. Would you like to change your answer?'\" \n The Executive Summmary of Reisman's study was eventually published by Donald Wildmon's American Family Association.\n \n KINSEY - 1, REISMAN - 0\n \n [SNIP]\n \n SUMMARY\n Let's review. First Reisman 'leaves' the Captain Kangaroo show. Then she accepts over $700K for a report that both her university and the Justice Department refuse to publish. She sues the Kinsey Institute for defamation, loses, and is forbidden to try again. She appears as an expert witness at The State of Ohio vs. the Contemporary Art Center and Dennis Barrie (Mapplethorpe and Cincinnati) and the defense has her for lunch. And finally, she supports a bill introduced by a wet-behind-the-ears, born-again freshman Congressman from Texas, which never even makes it to the floor. It's unlikely Reisman could get arrested at this point. Yet what makes her dangerous is the rarely questioned nature of her writings, and her association with ultra-conservative religious policy makers.\n \n In Kinsey's highly readable 'Sexual Behavior in the Human Male' he writes, \n It is, precisely, the function of a population analysis to help in the understanding of particular individuals by showing their relation to the remainder of the group. [Kinsey's emphasis] ...Without such a background, each individual becomes unique and unexplainable except through an elaborate investigation of him as an isolated entity.\n By attempting to prevent access to information about sex, social conservatives attempt to separate the individual from his social context and exploit his insecurities. By convincing an individual that his sexual interests are aberrations that grieve an ever voyeuristic God, social conservatives can control that person through both fear and guilt. Factual information about sexuality, and an individual's relation to the group, serve as a pure light - banishing ignorance and healing fear and guilt, bringing the individual back into the social milieu to which he belongs.\n \n Kinsey has admitted that his sample was not adequate to draw firm conclusions, and longed for a more comprehensive study to be conducted in the future. But the research Kinsey provided has given people a context for their own sexuality, protecting them from the priests and witch doctors who are ever ready to pry and condemn.\n \n Reisman's claims about the inadequacy of Kinsey's work would bear more weight if they called for new, and more comprehensive studies of sexuality. But this is not the case. Reisman and her cronies labor to outlaw any kind of informational sex education not based on conservatively interpreted biblical principles. Free of factual data on sex Dr. Reisman and her followers are at liberty to publish any kind of unsupported nonsense they choose about sex, homosexuality, and pornography.\n\n \n Adult Christianity TM | Alfred Kinsey, and Judith Reisman's Dirty Little Mind",

You have repeatedly refused.\n Now you try to backdoor a pretense of possible credibility as a \"whistle blower\"?\n \n If you want to argue that Socarides is being accurate, then ARGUE THAT.\n The evidence against Socarides' claim is there, and furthermore there are OTHER instances demonstrating Socarides penchant for absurd claims.\n \n \n \nFunny thing is, one would think you and others would WELCOME scrutiny of the convention.\n\n I do.\n But at the same time, I'm not going to entertain absurdly inaccurate claims and pretend that repeating them is \"scrutiny\".\n \n \n \nOne would think people would be going \"oh, your account is different? Let's look into it then.\" No. You just wave it off as \"BLOWI\" (which is saying he was lying, basically.)\n\n Jyoshu.\n SERIOUSLY now.\n Have you even tried to look for independent verification of Socarides claim?\n The fact that Dr. Hooker's evidence was presented at that convention is a well known fact.\n \n What you're doing is akin to saying \"no jews died in the *holocaust*\", and treating that statement like it's \"scrutiny\"... emoticon_rolleyes\n \n \n \nIf he was AT the convention, then that makes it all the more important to take what he says ABOUT the convention into consideration ...\n Sorry, but I'm not going to let you get away with this junk. Being called on it is not going to go away, F.\n\n ROFLMAO.\n Jyoshu, you are trying to give some pretense of credibility to Socarides WITHOUT EVEN USING ANYTHING beyond \"Socarides said...\"\n And then, when I bring into question Socarides CREDIBILITY, you ignore it declaring it as \"character assassination\".\n \n \n As an analogy, if the \"Boy who cried wolf.\" tried to pretend that the village was on fire, you would run up and declare him a \"whistle blower\" and pretend his claim has some credibility WHILE IGNORING THE VILLAGERS who are there who are saying the village is not on fire... :xbanghead",

   "To answer your question, if somebody says \"John reports that Mary has cancer\".\n But if John has no medical background, his background is in \"communications\", and he has been documented as saying absurd claims like \"red rooms cause cancer\"\n\n \n If a \"medical organization\" makes OVERT political posturing, one doesn't need a medical degree to see that. If an organization says it does one thing at its convention, and someone sees something else there, than that is something that happens (or not) independent of whether or not one has a \"medical degree.\" You're still doing the attack-the-credentials thing here, as if that MATTERS in this particular context. A person doesn't have to be a fireman to be able to ascertain that a building is on fire.\n \n This is common sense stuff, Foundit.\n \n \nI tire of the obfuscation.\n Quote me. Quote where I supposedly gave ONLY the explanation of \"lie\" and we'll talk about it.\n\n \n You used the term \"BLOWI\" here. If you didn't mean \"lie\" then maybe you need to clarify what you meant by it THIS time. (Or an even better idea ... stop using the silly little acronyms altogether. There hasn't been a case yet where you've use one that isn't really irrelevant, or a case of you trying to avoid having to hear a DIFFERENT side of angle on an issue.)\n \n \nJyoshu, one of the reasons I use \"BLOWI\" is to demonstrate that \"lying\" is not the only possibility. The person involved could be just that delusional to believe what is blatantly false.\n\n \n So which is it, here? Are you saying these people are lying or really believe what they're saying?\n \n \nJyoshu, this isn't really an issue of a \"conflicting report\". Dr. Hooker's research being entered into this convention IS DOCUMENTED.\n It HAPPENED.\n\n \n Say whaaaa???? emoticon_xdonno WHO said that research wasn't entered into that convention?? SPECIFICALLY, what are you saying they're lying about here, Foundit? WHAT is your point? Because frankly, you're all over the place here. They don't AGREE with the APA's stance here, and point out that political activism played a major role in it. \n \n Incidentally, how long are going to keep up this charade of portraying a different stance as being dishonest? With the sort of standards you're using here, no one could EVER disagree with an organization without being accused of such.\n \n \nJyoshu, you are trying to give some pretense of credibility to Socarides WITHOUT EVEN USING ANYTHING beyond \"Socarides said...\" And then, when I bring into question Socarides CREDIBILITY, you ignore it declaring it as \"character assassination\".\n\n \n Foundit, pretty much your entire basis for attacking Socarides is coming from a lobbyist organization--engaging in character assassination, no less--called RAlliance. I wonder where your groups drudge this stuff up, frankly. None of it speaks to the criticisms of the APA, by the way.\n \n But again, where are you getting this presumption that Socarides claims no evidence was presented at that convention? Because that premise seems to be the basis for you claims here. And even if Socarides IS one source that's not reliable, there were NUMEROUS sources in that article all pointing to the same problems.\n \n At any rate, it's fascinating watching you work here. You demand EVIDENCE (which of course isn't a bad thing in and of itself), but then when it's given, you then demand evidence of the EVIDENCE!! You always take the Anything-But approach to this sort of thing. Someone provides you with evidence of something, then you attack the evidence and demand THAT evidence be supported by evidence. It's gets downright absurd, and thank goodness it's not the approach most people take, because no group or organization could EVER be reformed or improved that way! It's like someone pointing out a few scientists who took issue with the status quo views on the climate in the 1980s and early 1990s, who first started really talking about global warming, and instead of noting THEIR STATEMENTS as evidence (alongside OTHER views out there on the matter) as well, discounting THEIR conclusions because they don't meet your absurd demands of evidence for their evidece. And when no one can do that because their conclusions themselves ARE the evidence they are putting forward, you'd assume they're dishonest. What's next ... evidence of the evidence of the evidence?? How many levels are you going to demand here? emoticon_xdonno emoticon_frazzled Quite frankly, this isn't that complicated of a situation. When you have an organization and SOME people come to the CONCLUSIONS there are problems in that organization, it's a wrongheaded approach to just dismiss those people out of hand. The fact people FROM WITHIN the organization point this stuff out IS evidence there's a problem. \n \n To use another analogy, it's like refusing to take a Catholic priest who points out problems in the Church as any evidence there are problems in the Church, instead saying \"no, show \"substantiation\" of your claim of these experiences, or I won't believe you.\" When in fact a priest coming forward to say these things should be taken as at least SOME evidence in and of itself. Or even worse yet, to go and drudge up anything you can from his past (even if bad things ARE there) to try and discredit him in any way rather than considering that there actually MAY BE problems in the Catholic church. The funny thing is, if the shoe were on the other foot here, and it WAS a case of a church we were talking about (like the LDS church) you'd be taking the comments of a few objecting people--disgruntled or not--as gospel truth of an internal problem. You'd be all over that. emoticon_smile",

A person doesn't have to be a fireman to be able to ascertain that a building is on fire.\n\n You are really not paying attention, and I think it's just cause you're trying to toss half-arsed excuses out there.\n \n Reisman, the woman who falsely claimed that the APA took pedophilia out of the DSM, is the one without the psychology degree. You haven't even tried to contest the fact that she was wrong.\n \n Socarides, who claims there was no research presented, has a degree in the field. But he is just plain wrong.\n How many different resources do I need to show you before you understand he was wrong?\n \n \n \nYou used the term \"BLOWI\" here. If you didn't mean \"lie\" then maybe you need to clarify what you meant by it THIS time. (Or an even better idea ... stop using the silly little acronyms altogether. There hasn't been a case yet where you've use one that isn't really irrelevant, or a case of you trying to avoid having to hear a DIFFERENT side of angle on an issue.)\n\n I've already explained what BLOWI means.\n Blatant Lie Or Willful Ignorance.\n And I use it because it is too often relevant for the anti-gay agenda. They either lie, or they insist on being terminally ignorant of the issue to the degree that they SHOULD recognize what they are saying as just plain false, but they don't.\n \n Quite frankly, it saves on typing, and it's repeatedly necessary, so I'm keeping it.\n Try to keep up...\n \n \n \nSo which is it, here? Are you saying these people are lying or really believe what they're saying?\n\n It doesn't matter.\n On the one hand, you have liars.\n On the other hand, you have the delusional.\n It doesn't matter which they are. The falsehood is so egregious that it's beyond justification.\n \n \n \nSay whaaaa???? emoticon_xdonno WHO said that research wasn't entered into that convention??

NOT an example of \"bias\" (unless you count Socarides bias).\n Or, he refuses to admit the research was entered.\n \n \n \nIncidentally, how long are going to keep up this charade of portraying a different stance as being dishonest? With the sort of standards you're using here, no one could EVER disagree with an organization without being accused of such.\n\n I have never utilized those standards.\n I have already explained the standards used, so you can either pay attention and RESPOND to what is said, or continue to whine about something that is your problem cause you're not paying attention.\n \n It's not a \"charade\", and you aren't even trying to CONTEST the issue in which the dishonesty.\n \n \n \nFoundit, pretty much your entire basis for attacking Socarides is coming from a lobbyist organization--engaging in character assassination, no less--called RAlliance. I wonder where your groups drudge this stuff up, frankly. None of it speaks to the criticisms of the APA, by the way.\n\n If you want to start discounting organizations just cause of who they are associated with, then Socarides obviously is discounted.\n His character attacks on the APA don't count.\n \n \"Ralliance\" CITED where their information came from.\n Are you denying that Socarides said those things?\n Which item are you contesting?\n \n Or is this another case where you substantiate no Socarides statement and offer no refutation of Socarides flaws, cause you know you can't win that battle, but instead try to work in pointless side-attacks?\n \n \n \nBut again, where are you getting this presumption that Socarides claims no evidence was presented at that convention? Because that premise seems to be the basis for you claims here. And even if Socarides IS one source that's not reliable, there were NUMEROUS sources in that article all pointing to the same problems.\n\n Quote the other SOURCES which claimed evidence was not presented.\n Cause if they are just complaining that they do not BELIEVE the research, then the claim on \"bias\" is lost.\n \n \n \nAt any rate, it's ...\n\n You lose yourself on an irrelevant tangent, criticizing actions I am not actually committing.\n And then there is the whole issue of you talking in terms that if I were to apply to you, you would complain up a storm...\n Hypocrisy, as usual...",
