Russia has no oil supply problems and deals in Euros, Syria has recently been accepted for EU trade agreements and Condi Rice is, for once thank patience, silent. Will we again wave the flag to refocus the American public on this threat to spreading democracy in the ME at the point of a gun, or let sovereign nations mind their own business?",

   "It should certainly be interesting to see how this plays out, especially in light of Iran and Syrias announcement today.\n \n It was intreresting to watch currency and US equity markets respond to the newa about the explosion in Iran today. The firs trealisation that something had happend for me came when I glanced at my inbox and it was full of pre-programmd stock and currency alerts. The dollar was quickly headed into the toilet, as was the US stock market. It was not until after we became reasonably certain that this was not a first strike by the US that the dollar and stock market went back to previous levels.\n \n I think we can infer from this what direction the majority of the world thinks such a confrontation is likely to go, at least for our economy.\n \n It was nice to see condi quiet through the russian announcement and the iranian event. If she had opened her mouth, she might very well have tanked the stock market in a single morning.",

Awww, that means so much! emoticon_xchicken \n I'm staying away from the politics section from now on if I can help it.

Anyways, I might be here more often because, well, I left one forum because the staff didn't want to or couldn't stop some of their mods from using fraudlent arguments, and I might leave another due to the large number of Republican Fanatics, many who are worse then Skylopps. Not to mention I just left another because 95% of the people of all spectrums were XXXXXX. \n \n It's interesting how Syria went from being a major intelligence provider for the US on terrorists organizations across the globe to being one of the new targets on the hit list.

Not to mention I just left another because 95% of the people of all spectrums were XXXXXX. \n\n \n Yes, if nothing else, you can always have pride in the fact that Daewoo doesn't think you are a waste of oxygen.\n \n The politcal forums here have kind of calmed down a little bit. Most of the fanatical bush supporters are gone or have quited down quite a bit. There is very definatly an \"oh my god, I cut off my willy\" undertone to most of their posts now, when they bother to post at all.\n \n It is almost like now that all the rationals for the Iraq war have evaporated, it it has become apparent that we have expended hundreds of billions of dollars and killed hundreds of thousadns of people in order to install a governemtn in Iraq that is closely alinged with that of Iran. North Korea is threatening to make the west coast disapear under a mushroom cloud unless we give them billions of dollars. It is almost like an old james bond movie...we should just start calling the N Korean government \"Spectre\" and get Sean Connery to negotiate with them and you would have it all. The russians are selling Syria arms and nuclear facilties, whether we like it or not. Iran is thumbing their nose at us and forming alliances with Syria and their neat new russian military toys. Al Queda has now quadrupled in size and has nearly 10x the money they did pre 9/11. Our deficit is through the roof, and the dollar is dropping like a rock.\n \n It is almost like the bush fanatics have stepped back and gone \"well, we certainly ****ed that one up\"\n \n \n There are some good new folks here since you last stopped in (or at least since I last noticed you were here).\n \n George is a good guy and knows as much about the economy as most anybody I have ever met\n Greg has a good head on his shoulders and makes for some interesting arguments\n Alan Rand is also a pretty good guy, for a brit (sorry, coudn't resist) also some good arguments to be had there\n Big Orn also seems to be a pretty good guy\n \n You missed a couple of good folks, too. there was pnac, who I think was probably about your age. He left becaue we had an argument about whether or not it was appropriate to beat a dog with a dead chicken. Kind of a sad argument, but funny all the same. There was a little more mud slinging that was probably really needed (Ok, I probably should have called his girlfriend trash), but it was an interesting argument.\n \n \n \nIt's interesting how Syria went from being a major intelligence provider for the US on terrorists organizations across the globe to being one of the new targets on the hit list. And people say we don't reward our allies. emoticon_rolleyes lol.\n\n \n Don't reward our allies? How could you say that? Look waht we did for Saddam, or Noriega.\n \n \n BTW, if you are trying to stay out of political battles, starting by posting in teh abortion forum, the nuclear power thread, and the capitol punishment thread is probably a bad way to start. You may as well hop into the middle of the creation/evolution debate (both sides of that argument seem to be wackos).",

I will admit I have been known to go trolling in the evolution/creationism forum just to get the evolutionists foaming at the mouth (my favorite tactic is using obscure and difficult ot understand physics theories as an example of the fact that the theory of evolution is not proven.....gets them foaming at the mouth every time. All kinds of fun to watch).",
