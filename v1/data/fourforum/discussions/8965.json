   "An interesting senate speech on CNN's biased coverage regarding global warming.\n \n http://www.epw.senate.gov/speechitem.cfm?party=rep&id=264027\n \"The central theme was not only one of thanks, but expressing frustration with the major media outlets because they knew in their guts that what they have been hearing in the news was false and misleading.\"\n \n I believe it's these kinds of stories which explain why the American public is growing increasingly skeptical of the hype. Despite the enormous 2006 media campaign to instill fear into the public, the number of people who believe that weather naturally changes -- is increasing. A Los Angeles Times/Bloomberg poll in August found that most Americans do not attribute the cause of recent severe weather events to global warming, and the portion of Americans who believe that climate change is due to natural variability has increased over 50% in the last five years. Given the diminishing importance of the mainstream media, I expect that trend to continue. ",

   "Left wing is pushing it to describe any multi-million dollar corporation. You could just about say that they have a more socially liberal view, but that's about it. No doubt a lot of people who do trust scientists have that view partly because of the media they are exposed to, but at least a view supporting scientists is based on the idea that scientists are actually seeking truth, rather than being part of a massive global conspiracy involving every western government except the US, the UN, major university science departments and a host of others. A bit of occam's razor has to come into play here.",
