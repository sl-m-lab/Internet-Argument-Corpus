Admittedly we have some serious gaps and flaws here and there, but it's better than the mythological garbage of Zeus or any other God for that matter, creating the world. Mass can neither be created or destroyed.\n\n Evolution is not about how, why or when the universe formed;it is not about the beginning of life. Evolution is simply a theory that various types of animals and plants have their origin in other preexisting types and that the distinguishable differences are due to modifications in successive generations. That's all, nothing else. It is also just a theory and not an assumed postulate that solves all of our questions about life.\n \n A separate theory, the Big Bang Theory, posits that the universe as we know it was formed between 12 and 14 billion years ago. The 15-20 billion year numbers come predominantly from measurements of nearby and distant galaxies, particularly their rates of expansion away from us. Stellar evolution theory and observations of globular clusters (believed to contain the oldest stars in the galaxy) give estimates for the ages of the stars of 15-18 billion years. The distance scale measurements and big bang theory suggest the universe is 8-12 billion years old. Hence, either stellar evolution theory is incorrect, or how we measure distances is wrong. At any rate, these are just theories, not postulates, and we continue to make observations and predictions so that we may attempt to confirm or deny these theories in the spirit of science.\n \n \nChristian: God did it. (Then you could visit Dr. Hovind, or other creationists for some logic and reasoning)\n\n A position born in times when man had less understanding of nature than he does now. There is no physical evidence to support or deny the existance of any supernatural entity. We do know that man has invented many gods to explain that which he does not know or understand through the course of time. At the same time, we have zero physical evidence to support the conclusion of any source as a first cause for existance so there is nothing wrong with some believing in a supernatural cause. It's not science but science has no proof of any cause either. Although we have no evidence to support such a cause, there is none that excludes it either.\n \n \nOf course both sides will say the other has fallible evidence.\n\n It is not a both sides issue. Many philosophical ideologies have been proffered throughout time, not just two. There is no evidence to conclude that any of them exclude any of the others as possible answers to some of our questions.\n \n \nNo matter what you'll never be able to convince the other side that they are wrong because you have the extraneous variable of faith......and faith being abstract and science being more of a physical nature is like saying oil is going to mix with water.\n\n It is pointless to continue to attempt to prove that any side is wrong for the sole purpose of trying to shore up some other point of view. The ID camp does this regularly by trying to point out that evolution doesn't work for this or that. This only prove that evolution doesn't work for this or that and provides no support that ID is the solution for those questions. Every side should realize that even if they could disprove all other theories it would not prove that their own is right.\n \n \nSo the ultimate answer comes down to your own convictions, knowledge, and experiences. Leaving the answer to the life long mystery as to \"Why are we here?\" up to the individual he or she must find the answer themself.\n\n The ultimate answer most honest people should come to is that we have questions that we don't have answers for. We are looking for those answers. To leap to any conclusion without conclusive proof is an act of faith, not an answer. For questions like \"Why are we here?\" the individual should realize that there are some questions we may never have an answer for; it is pointless to invent answers for these questions.",
