Was this guy doing the work of God?\n I think it is a shame this lion was shot with a dart, and hosed off, all for some crazed fundamentalist, the zoo should be ashamed. \n \n Although, notice he gave a command in the name of god \"come bite me!\", and the lion obeyed! Is that proof that god works through man and performs miracles (like MIND CONTROL)?\n \n -Mach",
