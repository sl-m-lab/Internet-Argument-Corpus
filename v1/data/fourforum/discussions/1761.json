That's liberals for you, the laws they propose are for the 'peasants', not for them to obey. They, afterall, are better suited for making decisions like these than you. You need them to think for you.. to care for you.. cradle to grave.\n \n You may also recall that famed anti-gunner Rosie O'Donnell has armed bodyguards but says you shouldn't have guns yourself. You cannot be trusted, afterall. And who was that writer who shot the kid in the hand that was swimming in his pool late one night? Carl something. Another anti-gunner who preaches 'do as I say, not as I do'.\n \n Liberals.. LOL!",

LOL!\n\n Do you see cops driving down the road, going over the speed limit, turning on their lights during rush hour to get to their exit which is just a little ways ahead and then turn their lights off after they exit the highway. People who enforce the law think that they are better than the law, and don't have follow the law, even if they enforce the law, or make them, i personally think that is Bull****!!!",
