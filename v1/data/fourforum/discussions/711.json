   "SHOULD WE EXPECT TO FIND TRANSITIONAL FORMS IN THE FOSSIL RECORD?\n - BTG No. 87b March 1996\n by John D. Morris, Ph.D.*\n \u00a9 Copyright 2003 Institute for Creation Research. All Rights Reserved.\n \"I pray thee, let a double portion of thy Spirit be upon me.\n And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing\" (II Kings 2.9, 10).\n A favorite argument of creationists has always been the lack of transitional organisms preserved in the fossil record. The argument goes like this: If one basic type of animal evolved into another basic type, it must have passed through \"in between\" stages, or transitional forms. Whether or not these transitions were ever preserved as fossils, they must have existed. In fact, they must have existed by the trillions.\n Consider an evolutionary favorite-the evolution of a four-legged land animal (variously described as cow-like or wolf-like), into a whale. Surely this incredible transition couldn't take place in just a few steps-legs into flippers, fur into oily skin, etc. Where are the transitional forms?\n Evolutionists sometimes brag that they have abundant evidence of transitions, but when pressed, the examples are almost always minor variations within a category, as expected within creation thinking, and thus certainly not proof of evolution.\n In general, evolutionists are quick to admit the almost complete lack of transitional fossils. In fact, many of the current leaders in evolutionary thought have made their careers attempting to explain this lack by proposing that evolution of isolated groups went so rapidly in the past that no individuals of the in-between forms were fossilized. Why should we expect to find fossils of organisms which existed only for a short time? Furthermore, they point out that fossilization rarely occurs today. It usually takes massive flooding and rapid burial.\n But then a new question arises. How complete is the fossil record? Can we legitimately expect to find these transitions?\n Dr. Michael Denton, an agnostic but a decided non-evolutionist compiled a chart on \"The Adequacy of the Fossil Record\" in his book, Evolution: A Theory In Crisis, by comparing the number of living types to fossil types, gleaning information from Romer's classic book, Vertebrate Paleontology. He found that 97.7% of living orders of terrestrial vertebrates are found as fossils. (Orders are larger groupings of families which are larger than genera which are larger then species.) Many creationists consider the groupings family or genus to best approximates the Genesis kind. Of living families of terrestrial vertebrates, 79.1% are represented, a number which jumps to 87.8% if birds (hardly ever preserved) are excluded. Thus, the fossil record of even terrestrial vertebrates is seen to be remarkably complete.\n But far less than 1% of all fossils are terrestrial vertebrates. Approximately 95% are marine invertebrates, with the rest being mostly plants, fish, and insects. Land fossils are notoriously scarce, and when found are usually fragmentary. With partial evidence an evolutionary story can sometimes be told.\n When we look at the invertebrates, we see separate and distinct categories (i.e., clams, corals, trilobites, etc.) existing in the earliest strata with no hint of ancestors or of intermediates. We find clams by the trillions, with a lot of variety among them, but no evolution. Furthermore, we have no idea how vertebrate fish could have arisen from any invertebrate. Where there are good data, we see no evolution. Where the data are scanty, evolutionists can tell a story. The fossil record is voluminous and apparently substantially complete. Yet no evolution is seen.\n Speaking of this issue, Darwin wrote in an 1881 letter that \"the case at present must remain inexplicable and may be truly argued as a valid argument against the views here entertained.\" Evolution-a theory of change without any evidence of change.\n *Dr. John Morris is the President of ICR.",

   "Argument one for transitional forms:\n \n I. Fish to Amphibian Transition\n \n Copyright 1997 G.R.Morton. This may be freely distributed as long as no change is made to the text and no charge is made.\n \n http://www.glenn.morton.btinternet.co.uk/transit.htm\n \n Creationists claim that there are no transitional forms. This claim is made over and over as if it were a mantra. The plain fact is that there are transitional sequences but they never discuss the details. This is a sequence of fossils which occupy the transition from fish to amphibian.\n \n 378 MYR ago- Panderichthys--These are lobe-finned fish. Panderichthys was a rhipidistian,osteolepiform fish. The skull bones of these fish are bone for bone equivalents to the skull bones of the earliest tetrapods. (Carroll 1988, p. 160). These are the only fish whose fin bones fit the tetrapod pattern of humerus, ulna and radius in the forelimb and femur, tibia and fibula in the hindlimb. (Thomson, 1991, p. 488), Yet these limbs still have fins on them (Coates, 1994,p. 174). Their brain case is so much like that of the earliest tetrapod, they were originally classified as tetrapods until a complete skeleton was found. Then is was proven that they were really still fish. (Ahlberg and Milner, 1994, p. 508). This fish also had lungs and nostrils (Vorobyeva and Schulze, 1991, p.87) but also had gills. These things really looked like tetrapods until you see the fins. The teeth had infolding enamel which is identical to that of the earliest tetrapods. Unlike all fish but like the tetrapods, the Panderichthys have lost the dorsal and anal fins, leaving 4 fins in the place where legs would be in the Tetrapods.(Ahlberg and Milner, p.508). This contradicts Gish's claim that there is no fossil which shows loss of fins. (Gish, 1978, p. 78-79). Unlike fish, Panderichthys had a tail, like the amphibians with the fins stretched out along the top (Carroll, 1995, p. 389; Carroll, 1996, p. 19). \n This is not a Panderichthys, but it is a related lobe-finned Devonian fish out of my personal collection. It gives some idea of what they looked like. \n \n \n Panderichthyids and all other osteolepiform fish had a choana, a hole between the nasal passage and the mouth. This hole is missing in all other lobe-finned fish. It allowed air to pass from the nose into the mouth.. But Panderichthys also had external nostrils which were in the same position as those of the early tetrapods. (Schultze, 1991, p. 58). The lower jaws of panderichthyids had broad coronoids with fangs (Ahlberg 1991, p. 299) \n \n 370--Fish similar to Sauripterus. A very recent discovery in Pennsylvania by Daeschler and Shubin (1998, p. 133; Kinney, 1998) is of a fish which has fins, which is not unusual, except that inside of the fins were 8 fingers attached in a similar way to those of the earliest amphibians (see below). While many doubt that this creature is on the direct line of descent between fish and amphibians, the existence of fins with 'fingers' is illustrative of the fact that intermediate forms (broadly defined) do exist. Interestingly, as we shall see some of the earliest amphibians also had 8 digits on their hands. \n \n \n 368-Elginerpeton is a very primitive tetrapod found at Scat Craig, Scotland. Its lower jaw had coronoid fangs as did Panderichthys but they were smaller (Ahlberg 1991, p. 299). The very primitive limb bones found with it include an Ichthyostega-like tibia and an ilia and shoulder girdle comparable to the future Hynerpeton. There are no hands or feet found with the fossil so while the animal is quite tetrapod like in the parts which have been preserved, the final proof of its tetrapod status is missing. (Carroll, 1996, p. 19)\n \n 368 MYR- Obruchevichthys was found in Latvia and Russia but is only known from a partial mandible. The similarity between this mandible and Elginerpeton caused Ahlberg (1991) to reclassify this as a tetrapod. This creature also shows the coronoid fangs of the Panderichthys but they were also smaller than the panderichthyid fangs. Daeschler notes that this animal also has the parasymphysial fans of a tetrapod. (Daeschler, 2000, p. 307)\n \n 365-363 MYR -Hynerpeton-more advanced legs and pelvic girdle than Ichthyostega. (Carroll, 1996, p. 19) The coronoid fangs are not present. It lacked internal gills (Daeschler et al, 1994, p 641). There is no mention of feet having been found in Daeshler's report. The shape of the pectoral girdle implies both an aquatic and a terrestrial lifestyle. \n \n 365-363 MYR -Densignathus rowei--known only from the jaw but it is transitional between fish and amphibians. It has the parasymphysial fang of a stem tetrapod but also the coronoid fangs of a fish. As noted above Daeschler says this combination is also found in Obruchevichthys, Ventastega and Metaxygnathus. (Daeschler, 2000, p. 307). The earlier fish had a closed manidbular canal while the early amphibians had an open mandibular canal. Densignathus rowei is intermediate with a partially enclosed mandibular canal. Once again a transitional trait. \n \n 363 MYR-Ichthyostega-- Is the first animal with feet but the feet are different than most tetrapod feet. They are much like Acanthostega but has 7 digits on his hindlimb. His legs were only good for being in water. They could not support his weight. (Coates and Clack, 1990, p. 67) These are half evolved legs since they have more digits than the normal tetrapod but fewer bony rays than the fish and they are unable to support the weight. This contradicts Gish's statement that there are no half-evolved feet. (Gish, 1978, p. 79) . Ichthyostega had external nasal openings and a choana like that of the Panderichthys (Schultze, 1990, p. 35). He has lungs and gills. His tail was long with fins above and below like that Panderichthys and Acanthostega. (Carroll, 1992, p. 46). His legs were tetrapod having humerus, ulna and radius in the forelimb and femur, tibia and fibula in the hindlimb. (see diagram Carroll, 1992, p. 46). \n \n 363 MYR- Acanthostega- has four legs, lungs but still has internal gills. (Coates and Clack , 1991, p. 234) He has 8 digits on his front leg (see second picture below); seven on his back feet. (Carroll, 1995, p. 389) His legs could not support his weight either. (Coats and Clack, 1990, p. 66-67). Ahlberg (1991, p. 301) points out that the front legs were more fish-like than the back legs. He has fishlike lower arm bones (Coates and Clack 1990, p. 67). Once again, contrary to Gish (1978, p. 79), these are still half-evolved legs. He also retains a caudal fin (Coates, 1994, p. 175) and an elongated tail with fins stretched out along the top. (Carroll, 1995, p. 389). The stapes, the bone which eventually became part of the hearing apparatus in tetrapods was still used for ventilation of the gills (Clack,1989, p. 426). \n \n Acanthostega served from http://www.sciencenews.org/Sn_arc99/5_22_99/bob1a.jpg \n \n One thing that the earliest tetrapods lacked were hands that could flex. We can curl our fingers and toes because of the arrangement of the tendons in our digits. None of the above tetrapods could do this simple trick because they lacked a notch in the flexor surface on the phalanges. Because of this, walking on a rocky surface, which requires the ability to curl the paws around various obstacles, would have been difficult for the early tetrapods. Acanthostega and Ichthyostega would only have been able to bend their hands slightly (Monastersky, 1999, p. 329). \n \n Thus, while they had hands, they were partially evolved hands. It wasn't until the evolution of Casineria kiddi, that these notches are found on each phalange. (Paton et al, 1999, p. 512)\n \n 350 MYR ago. Pederpes finneyae- This creature was discovered at Dumbarton, Scotland. It has 5 toes on each foot with the exception of a small relict finger/toe on the forepaw. Because of this, this creature is transitional between the later amphibians and Acanthostega and Ichthyostega discussed above (Carroll, 2002, p. 35). This creature has a primitive stapes, the bone used in hearing and it resembles that of Acanthostega rather than those of the later amphibians. The expanded triangular flair on the ribs resemble those of Ichthyostega. (Clack, 2002, p. 74). But, unlike the early tetrapods this creature has a \"clearly distinguishable metatarsals that are bilaterally and proximodistally asymmetric.\" (Clack, 2002, p.75). This is a trait which it shares only with the later terrestrially adapted amphibians. Thus, once again, this creature shows intermediate or transitional traits. Those who erroneously claim transitional forms don't exist, haven't looked at the data.\n \n 340 MYR ago. Fully evolved amphibians.

   "II. Amphibians to Reptiles (amniotes) Transitionals.\n \n Along with its surprises, the tetrapod from Cheese Bay also offers some confirmation for a 30-year-old theory about how amniotes arose.\n \n \"As soon as I saw the specimen of Casineria, I was terribly excited because here was a small form,\" says paleontologist Robert L. Carroll of McGill University in Montreal. In 1970, Carroll proposed that amniotes evolved from a line of miniature amphibians, much smaller than brutes like Acanthostega.\n http://www.sciencenews.org/sn_arc99/5_22_99/bob1.htm\n \n Unlike many amphibians, most plethodontid salamanders lay their eggs on land and do not pass through a larval stage. Instead, the embryonic salamanders develop directly into an adult body form. At the heart of Carroll's theory lies the amniote egg, which has a series of membranes not present in the simpler eggs of frogs and salamanders.\n \n Now, researchers must push back their search to the time preceding Casineria kiddi, when animals were first coming to grips with their new, dry environment. In rocks older than the Cheese Bay specimen, paleontologists will chisel away at the ancient sediments, hammers held tight in a five-fingered grasp that reaches straight through the ages back to the Carboniferous world.\n \n The oldest amniotes currently known date from the Middle Pennsylvanian locality known as Joggins, in Nova Scotia (Carroll, 1964). The relationships of these fossils indicate that amniotes first diverged into two lines, one line (Synapsida) that culminated in living mammals, and another line (Sauropsida) that embraces all the living reptiles (including birds). \n \n One Joggins fossil, the \"protorothyridid\" Hylonomus, appears to be a very early member of the line leading to Sauria (Crown-clade diapsids), the clade encompassing all living diapsids. This suggests that the more inclusive clade of which turtles (Testudines) are part (Anapsida) in most morphological phylogenies had diverged as well, even though its current record extends back only to the Lower Permian (Laurin & Reisz, 1995). http://tolweb.org/tree?group=Amniota&contgroup=Terrestrial_Vertebrates\n \n Cuchulainn",

   "III. Reptile to Bird Transitionals\n \n Harpagus bidentatus\n \n IBEROMESORNIS\n (pronounces eye-BER-oh-mes-OR-nis) Iberomesornis (meaning \"Iberian=Spanish intermediate bird\") was a small, early, toothed bird that lived during the early Cretaceous period. It was capable of powered flight. It had tiny, spiky teeth in its beak and was the size of a sparrow. Its hip was primitive compared to modern birds; its ilium, ischium, and pubis were all parallel and directed backward. Iberomesornis was named by paleontologists Sanz and Bonaparte in 1992. Fossils were found in Spain. The type species is I. romeralli.\n \n ICHTHYORNIS\n Ichthyornis (meaning \"fish bird\") were 8 inch (20 cm) long, toothed, tern-like, extinct bird that date from the late Cretaceous period. It had a large head and beak. This powerful flyer is the oldest-known bird that had a keeled breastbone (sternum) similar to that of modern birds. It lived in flocks nesting on shorelines, and hunted for fish over the seas. Ichthyornis was originally found in 1872 in Kansas, USA, by a member of paleontologist Othniel C. Marsh's Yale University expedition. Fossils have been found in Kansas and Texas, USA and Alberta, Canada.

   "V. Reptile to Mammal Transitionals\n \n http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Hangar/2437/therapsd.htm\n \n The mammals are believed to have evolved from a class of Permian and Triassic reptiles known as therapsids. Taxonomically, mammals are distinguished by a number of features, the most obvious of which are hair (even such aquatic mammals as whales and dolphins still retain bristly hairs in their skin), and the presence of mammary glands which secrete milk, used to nourish the young. Neither of these structures is preserved in the fossil record, but fortunately, mammals can also be distinguished by a number of skeletal characteristics (particularly in the skull and teeth). In particular, mammals are distinguished from reptiles by a number of skeletal traits. \n \n Reptiles have a much larger number of individual bones in their skulls than do mammals. In reptiles, the teeth are all of the same shape, and although they vary slightly in size, they all have the same simple cone-shaped form. Mammals, however, possess a number of different types of teeth in their jaws, from the flat, multi-cusped molar teeth to the sharp cone-shaped canines. In reptiles, the lower jaw is made up of a number of different bones, and the jaw joint is formed between the quadrate bone in the skull and the angular bone in the jaw. In mammals, by contrast, the lower jaw is made up of a single bone, the dentary, which articulates with the squamosal bone in the skull to form the jaw joint. \n \n Reptiles also have a single bone in the middle ear, the stapes. In mammals, there are three bones in the middle ear, the malleus, incus and stapes (also known as the hammer, anvil and stirrup). At the top of the skull, reptiles have a small hole through which the pineal body, or \"third eye\", extends--this is absent in mammals. Finally, the reptilian skull is attached to the spine by a single point of contact, the occipital condyle. In mammals, the occipital condyle is double-faced. \n \n \"Probainognathus, a small cynodont reptile from the Triassic sediments of Argentina, shows characters in the skull and jaws far advanced toward the mammalian condition. Thus it had teeth differentiated into incisors, a canine and postcanines, a double occipital condyle and a well-developed secondary palate, all features typical of the mammals, but most significantly the articulation between the skull and the lower jaw was on the very threshhold between the reptilian and mammalian condition. The two bones forming the articulation between skull and mandible in the reptiles, the quadrate and articular respectively, were still present but were very small, and loosely joined to the bones that constituted the mammalian joint . . . Therefore in Probainognathus there was a double articulation between skull and jaw, and of particular interest, the quadrate bone, so small and so loosely joined to the squamosal, was intimately articulated with the stapes bone of the middle ear. It quite obviously was well on its way towards being the incus bone of the three-bone complex that characterizes the mammalian middle ear.\" (Colbert and Morales, 1991, pp. 228-229\n \n The reptiles, as we have noted, have one bone in the middle ear and several bones in the lower jaw, and mammals have three bones in the middle ear and only one bone in the lower jaw. On the other hand, the jaw joints in the reptile are formed from different bones than they are in the mammalian skull. Thus, it is apparent that, during the evolutionary transition from reptile to mammal, the jaw joints must have shifted from one bone to another, freeing up the rest of these bones to form the auditory ossicles in the mammalian middle ear. (In fact, in most modern reptiles, the jawbones in question actually function in transmitting sound waves to the inner ear, so the transformation postulated above is not a functional change, merely an improvement in a fnction that these bones already had). As Arthur N. Strahler puts it, \"A transitional form must have had two joints in operation simultaneously (as in the modern rattlesnake), and this phase was followed by a fusion of the lower joint.\" (Strahler 1987, p. 414) The creationists find this process to be impossible to conceive, and claim there is no fossil evidence for it:\n \n Paleontologists point out that the therapsids possessed many of the characteristics of both reptiles and mammals:\n \"In advanced forms, the skull was intermediate in type between that of a primitive reptile and a mammal; many of the bones absent in mammals were on their way toward reduction or were already lost. A small third eye was still generally present in the top of the skull, but its opening was a tiny one.\" (Romer, 1967, p. 226) \n \"The differentiation of the teeth progressed in the therapsids to high levels of development, with the advanced genera showing sharply contrasted incisors, canines, and cheek teeth, which in some of these reptiles were of complex form, often with accessory cusps or broad crowns. In many therapsids, the occipital condyle became double, as in the mammals.\" (Colbert and Morales, 1991, p. 118) \n \"In many respect, the tritylodont skull was very mammalian in its features. Certainly, because of the advanced nature of the zygomatic arches, the secondary palate and the specialized teeth, these animals had feeding habits that were close to those of some mammals . . . . Yet, in spite of these advances, the tritylodonts still retained the reptilian joint between the quadrate bone of the skull and the articular bone of the lower jaw. It is true that these bones were very much reduced, so that the squamosal bone of the skull and the dentary bone of the lower jaw (the two bones involved in the mammalian jaw articulation) were on the point of touching each other.\" (Colbert and Morales, 1991, p. 127) \n The therapsid-mammal transition was completed with the appearence of the Morganucodonts in the late Triassic. This group is described by paleontologist T.S. Kemp: \n \"The axes of the two jaw hinges, dentary-squamosal and articular-quadrate, coincide along a lateral-medial line, and therefore the double jaw articulation of the most advanced cynodonts is still present . . . The secondary dentary-squamosal jaw hinge had enlarged (in the Morganucodonts) and took a greater proportion if not all of the stresses at the jaw articulation. The articular-quadrate hinge was free to function solely in sound conduction.\" (Strahler, 1987, p. 419)\n \n We also must remember the egg laying mammals. There is the Duckbilled platypus and the Echidna.\n \n Cuchulainn",

   "DON'T THE FOSSILS PROVE EVOLUTION?\n - BTG No. 172b April 2003\n by John D. Morris, Ph.D.*\n \u00a9 Copyright 2003 Institute for Creation Research. All Rights Reserved.\n For decades students have been shown a representation of the fossil record appearing as a vertical column with marine invertebrates on the bottom, overlain by fish, then amphibians, reptiles, and mammals, with man on the top. The column is a column of time, they are told, with the long ago past on the bottom and the present on top. The fossil column (or similar figure) is presented without question as if it were true-as if it were real data. Students are led to believe that the order of first appearance of the fossils over time proves evolution. \n I suggest that it does no such thing, for several reasons. First, the fossils do not occur in this order, simple to complex from bottom to top. The fossils at the bottom (i.e., long ago) are equally as complex as any animal today, and are essentially the same as their modern counterparts. In reality, the fossils appear abruptly in the record, fully formed and fully functional without less adapted ancestors in lower levels that would have preceded them in time. To be honest, the entire fossil record consists of predominately marine invertebrates (animals without a backbone, like clams, jellyfish, coral). The column is nothing more than a statement of evolutionary thinking. A case can perhaps be made for the order of first appearance of vertebrates (i.e., fish, amphibians, reptiles, mammals), but vertebrate fossils are exceptions to the rule and usually quite fragmentary, with the lower range of each often being extended downward with new discoveries. Most come from Ice Age deposits which sometimes contain human remains also. \n Second, the evolutionary presentation in the textbook column implies that all life has come from one (or perhaps a few) common ancestor(s). But the Cambrian System, the lowest (i.e., oldest) level containing extensive multicellular fossils, exhibits a virtual explosion of life. Suddenly (by this I mean without the necessary ancestors lower in the column), every phylum of life is found-every basic body style, including vertebrate fish. The abrupt appearance of diverse forms of life does not match with evolutionary predictions of one form descending into many. \n Third, these diverse forms continue up the column (i.e., throughout time) with much the same appearance possessed at the start. The term stasis describes the tendency to \"stay\" the same, remain \"stationary\" or \"static.\" Some body styles go extinct as you come up the column, but no new basic styles are introduced. \n Summarizing: \n 1) Abrupt appearance \n 2) Diversity at the start, and \n 3) Stasis.\n Certainly the fossil record does not prove evolution. On the other hand, its character fully supports creation of multiple \"kinds\" at the start with no evolutionary lineage, and continuance of those rather static kinds with limited adaptations into the present, or else going extinct. This is the creation idea. \n The fossils further support the Flood. While no evolutionary trends can be seen bridging the basic kinds and producing new ones, we do see a transition from totally marine at the bottom to more terrestrial toward the top. At every level the dominant fossil is marine, but more and more land-dwelling fossils creep in. What more pursuasive testimony to the Biblical model could there be?",

   "CAN THE SMALL CHANGES WE SEE ADD UP TO THE BIG CHANGES NEEDED FOR EVOLUTION?\n - BTG No. 161b May 2002\n by John D. Morris, Ph.D.*\n \u00a9 Copyright 2003 Institute for Creation Research. All Rights Reserved.\n My years at ICR have been punctuated by numerous creation/evolution debates, but actually my first such debate came as a sophomore in high school. When the issue came up, I was selected to \"debate\" the class evolutionist. \n My opponent began her presentation by defining evolution as simply \"change over time.\" She documented many examples of change in non-living things as well as plants and animals. Even people change over time. We are, on average, taller than our ancestors just a few generations ago. As a population certainly we age. No one could dispute that these changes have occurred, thus she had \"proven\" that evolution had occurred. \n And therein lies the crux of the matter. You simply must define terms carefully. Evolution in the meaningful sense implies big changes, like a fish turning into a person. Has this happened? Do the small changes we observe over time add up to the big changes needed by evolution? Did a single-celled organism become a marine invertebrate, then a fish, then an amphibian, then a reptile, then a mammal, then an ape-like ancestor then a person? These truly big changes must have occurred if evolution really accounts for all of life. \n It's instructive to try to imagine what must happen to turn a cell into an invertebrate, or a worm into a fish, or a fish into an amphibian, etc. List the structural changes needed. A cell doesn't have the genes needed to produce even a simple nodal chord, nor does a fish have the genes to produce legs. This extra genetic information must be added from some \n external source, but science knows of no such source. Mutations do produce novel genetic changes, but never has a mutation been known to add coded information to an already complex DNA system. On the contrary, it usually and easily causes a deterioration of the information present in the DNA. For random mutations to add the information for a leg where there is none is asking a lot, in fact, asking too much. Never has a helpful mutation been observed, yet trillions are needed. \n Listing all the differences between a fish and an amphibian, or a reptile and a bird, or reptile and mammal helps to clarify the immensity of evolution's task. Not only are there skeletal changes, but think of the totally new organs needed, different reproductive systems, altered respiratory and cardiovascular make-up, thermal schemes and on and on. \n Step back and take a look at the big picture. Evolution, as a concept of everything, is worse than non-science, it is nonsense. The highly complex information laden DNA code cannot yet even be read by today's genomists. How could it have written itself by chance mutation or genetic recombination. Surely some things simply cannot be. \n When a vote was taken as to who won the debate, I came out on top 32-1. The lone vote for evolution was an exchange student from Marxist China, and even he admitted I had the better arguments. He just didn't dare vote against the party line. \n Maybe that's the key. It takes a prior, gut-level commitment to evolution to continue to favor it in spite of the weight of evidence to the contrary.",

   "WHY CAN'T GENETICISTS SEE THE OBVIOUS EVIDENCE FOR CREATION IN THE GENETIC CODE?\n - BTG No. 142b October 2000\n by John D. Morris, Ph.D.*\n \u00a9 Copyright 2003 Institute for Creation Research. All Rights Reserved.\n \"Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: \n the devils also believe, and tremble.\" (James 2:19)\n Recently geneticists announced that they had successfully read the human DNA code. This truly marvelous achievement ranks as one of the most remarkable in history. Creationists rejoice over the news, confident that the more we learn, the more we'll recognize the signature of God in what He has done, and give Him glory. \n Scientists haven't actually deciphered the code, but they have, as it were, identified the \"letters\" in the code. They only know a few \"words\" as of yet, and really don't know the \"language,\" or where the punctuation goes. There are about three billion letters in the human DNA, and the whole thing is enormously complex-not at all what would be expected from random evolution. \n Recently a molecular biologist working on identifying genetic controls for diseases was interviewed by George Caylor of The Ledger, Lynchburg, Virginia. His article entitled, \"The Biologist,\" appeared on February 17, 2000. I received permission to reproduce parts of the interview here, as a conversation between \"G\" (the interviewer) and \"J\" (the molecular biologist). It began by discussing the complexity of human code. \n J: \"I'm a bit like an editor, trying to find a spelling mistake inside a document larger than four complete sets of Encyclopedia Britanica.\" \n G: \"Do you believe that the information evolved?\" \n J: \"George, nobody I know in my profession believes it evolved. It was engineered by `genius beyond genius,' and such information could not have been written any other way. The paper and ink did not write the book! Knowing what we know, it is ridiculous to think otherwise.\" \n G: \"Have you ever stated that in a public lecture, or in any public writings?\" \n J: \"No. I just say it evolved. To be a molecular biologist requires one to hold on to two insanities at all times. One, it would be insane to believe in evolution when you can see the truth for yourself. Two, it would be insane to say you don't believe in evolution. All government work, research grants, papers, big college lectures-everything would stop. I'd be out of a job, or relegated to the outer fringes where I couldn't earn a decent living.\" \n G: \"I hate to say it, but that sounds intellectually dishonest.\" \n J: \"The work I do in genetic research is honorable. We will find the cures to many of mankind's worst diseases. But in the meantime, we have to live with the `elephant in the living room'.\" \n G: \"What elephant?\" \n J: \"Creation design. It's like an elephant in the living room. It moves around, takes up an enormous amount of space, loudly trumpets, bumps into us, knocks things over, eats a ton of hay, and smells like an elephant. And yet we have to swear it isn't there!\" \n * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * \n Yes, geneticists do see the evidence for creation, and they see it clearly, but peer pressure, financial considerations, political correctness, and a religious commitment to naturalism force them to look the other way, and insist they see nothing. And so, the illogical origins myth of modern society perpetuates itself. \n There is a better way. Acknowledge the elephant and harness its immense power. Can you imagine the good which would result from genetic research if it were decoupled from its insanities?",

It is the same list we see again and again, one of several that are posted by creationist organizations and are used to back up claims that scientists are flocking to creationism by the hundreds. Your list is composed only of \"scientists\" that are associated with the ICR. Still your list misses the two Morris (a hydrolic engineer and a geological engineer) and Austin (a geologist) that I happened to notice.\n \n But you still miss the point. \"Project Steve\" isn't meant to discredit your list. It is meant to mock it. For many years I have been hearing how scientists are turning to creation science and the evidence is always the same few lists of scientists, most of whom don't even have degrees in relevant fields. One of the widely circulated lists what checked out at one time. Each of the people on the list were contacted and asked if they believed in a young earth or Biblical creation. Some did, most did not. The responded in the affirmative to a statement that Darwinian evolution should be questioned. Big deal. I question it too and every evolutionary biologist questions it every day.\n \n But still, there may be hundreds of qualified scientists that are creationists. On the other hand, there are tens of thousands of scientists who accept evolution as the best explanation for the observed facts (the Steve List is now at 381 - at 1% of the population, that would equate to about 38,100 scientists). Overall, about 95% of scientists of the world accept evolution and about 99% of the biologists. Also, physicists, geologists, astronomers, and cosmologists have percentages around 98 to 99%. The lowest percentage is among chemists.\n \n And none of the scientists on the Steve List was required to sign a statement of faith in which they agree to reject all evidence that contradicts a literal reading of the Bible. The ICR and AIG both have such statements.\n \n Moreover, fundamentalist christianity and young earth creationism are movements that are unique to the U.S. There are few of either anywhere else. Both movements are about 200 years old. Fundamentalism was a reaction to the findings of scientists (Christians who believed in creation, by the way) that the geology of the earth indicated that it was very old and their failure to find a trace of a universal flood. The basic philosophy of fundamentalism is anti-science and anti-education. It always was and still is.",

It was capable of powered flight. It had tiny, spiky teeth in its beak and was the size of a sparrow. Its hip was primitive compared to modern birds; its ilium, ischium, and pubis were all parallel and directed backward. Iberomesornis was named by paleontologists Sanz and Bonaparte in 1992.

It had a large head and beak. This powerful flyer is the oldest-known bird that had a keeled breastbone (sternum) similar to that of modern birds. It lived in flocks nesting on shorelines, and hunted for fish over the seas. Ichthyornis was originally found in 1872 in Kansas, USA, by a member of paleontologist Othniel C.

   "Hey, what about the Archaeoraptor! Is that a transitional? Ooops, no that was a fake!

Truth and careful scientific weighing of evidence have been among the first casualties in their program, which is now fast becoming one of the grander scientific hoaxes of our age 'the paleontological equivalent of cold fusion.' Was this said by some Bible-thumping, scientifically ignorant creationist, as our wishful-thinking opponents love to paint us? No, this was written by Dr Storrs Olson, Curator of Birds at the National Museum of Natural History of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC, and an evolutionist himself. He wrote this in an Open Letter in response to National Geographic's shameless promotion of Archaeoraptor as the 'proof' of the dino-to-bird theory. (Since then, Archaeoraptor was conclusively shown to be a hoax.)\" \n http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs2002/1126dinosaur.asp\n \n \n At best you can say is that Archaeopteryx is an interesting specimen.\n \n \n \n \n Archaeoraptor:\n \"In the autumn months of 1999, Canadian paleontologist Phil Currie and dinosaur sculptor Stephen Czerkas announced the discovery of an unbelievable new \"missing link\" between dinosaurs and birds in National Geographic magazine. This specimen, which they named Archaeoraptor, was discovered to be a fake, composed of a long tail from one dinosaur and a body of another. Scientists pledged to name these two pieces individually, and now this is the case. \n Microraptor was the tail of this specimen. Xu and his colleagues simply took the tail from this controversial chimera and matched it to the body of a different specimen. The result was Microraptor, which, unlike its earlier counterpart, is genuine and truly does hold importance in understanding the theory of dinosaur-bird evolution\"\n \n http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Galaxy/8152/microraptor.html\n\n \n The anatomy of Archaeopteryx will not permit its being called a modern bird, however much creationists or Alan Feduccia et al in their passion for discrediting theropod origin wish it would. I would challenge you to provide solid morphologic data which permits Archaeopteryx to be classified as a Neornithean, or even a member of Aves, in the sense that Linne used it (the sense creationists should be most comfortable with). \n \n As for Hoyle & Wickramsinghe's professional suicide (i.e., their idiotic tract on the forgery of the urvogel material), I merely refer the reader to the truly brutal deconstruction offered by Alan Charig and his associates at the British Museum of Natural History (Greenaway et al 1986, Courtice 1987, Dickson 1987). The full references are below:\n \n Greenaway et al. 1986. Archaeopteryx is not a forgery. Science 232: 622-626.\n \n Courtice, G. 1987. Museum officials confident Archaeopteryx is genuine...but opponents renew demands for proof. Nature 328: 657.\n \n Dickson, D. 1987. Feathers still fly in row over fossil bird. Science 238: 475-476.\n \n You bring up Archaeoraptor, and this is interesting. Let us examine the matter. Was it creationists who spotted the nasty little fraud, and promptly exposed the evolutionary community for passing it off as a valid fossil? Not at all. It was the evolutionary community itself which asserted the chimera-status of Archaeoraptor--a sterling example of the sort of internal correction which the constant skepticism and critical thinking science promotes, can lead to. \n \n And last, but not least, we have the distinguished Storrs Olson, of the Smithsonian. He is a brilliant scientist, one of the leading ornithologists to be sure, and some of his work has been crucial to studies in the origin, evolution and present-diversity of birds. Yet, in his continued advocacy of thecodont-origin for birds, he is simply incorrect. There remains a distinct paucity of evidence supporting this now discredited theory. As it were, I am endlessly amused by creationists who quote Olson's letter to the National Geographic--Olson is hardly a creationist, and has nothing but a fair bit of contempt for that movement. It strikes me as odd that you should quote those who would entirely disagree with you. I might as well use Duane Gish as an authority on the urvogel.\n \n Vindex Urvogel",

Have you read anything that suggests pathways that expalin\n a) the move in the wing\n b) the rise of a unique breathing-system?\n\n \n \n It is not the position of the wings--which is fixed in birds--but rather the manal formula that is debated. The manal formula in birds is almost certainly II, III, IV, whereas it has been supposed that dinosaur hands are characterized by a postaxial reduction yielding digits, I, II and III. Digital \"mis-match,\" though parroted as a fatal lack of homology for theropod origin, is in fact quite easily explained, whether one advocates Gauthier & Wagner's homeotic frame shift mutation, or the hypothesis recently formulated by Galis et al. As for the breathing system of birds, the concomitant skeletal modifications for the dynamic avian pulmonary apparatus already begin to appear in the earliest Dinosauria, with the presence of pneumaticity in the vertebrae and other bones, which in later more derived theropods become pleurocoels and pulmonary diverticula. The presence of a derived sternocostal apparatus and uncinate processes, together with an ossified sternum in multiple par-avian Maniraptora further suggests that these taxa had a more or less \"modern\" avian respiratory mechanism, as do the structure of the nasals. It is plausible that this system had its origins within the stem-Ornithosuchia, or perhaps at a more derived node in this clade. To be sure, it was a latent phenotypic character, in the common ancestor of Ornithodira. \n \n Vindex Urvogel",
