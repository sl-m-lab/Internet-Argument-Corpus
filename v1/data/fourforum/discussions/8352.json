   "I'm just wondering what everyone does to improve their health, those who actually do care about their health. \n \n I have access to a 3 horsepower blender that is used to make some very high powered shakes that includes veggies, fruits, and certain seeds that have great properties. I drink green magma(bought at any health store), I take supplements that help cleanse the colon, liver, and kidneys, and I drink a product called Mona Vie that has a nice ammount of phytonutrients and acai berry juice.\n\n \n Oh, boy! *cracks knuckles*\n \n About four years ago I started getting serious about my health. First, I stopped eating all foods that contain hydrogenated oils, quit caffiene, and began a regime of supplements and vitamins. They have changed as I learned more about what I need. Then, I cut out MSG, nitrates, and high sodium products. After that it wasn't too difficult to cut out all processed foods. Everything I eat (with a few exceptions) is something I've made from stratch. I do not eat red meat of any kind. I will eat chicken rarely if it is grain fed, cage free and \"organic\". However, it is cost prohibitive. I will eat some seafood such as salmon and shrimp. No alcohol. I have recently begun to cut out all sugars. I mean, all of 'em. This part sucks, and I backslide on organic ice cream. Oh, yeah, I've cut all dairy unless it's organic without hormones and blah blah, but again, cost prohibitive (a pint of organic vanilla is $4.99!). The only grains I ingest are spelt, brown rice flour, quinoa, and kamut.\n I drink only purified water and occasionally almond milk. \"Fast\" food for me, a treat, is Chinese or Thai. Love me some spicy stir fry!\n \n I also exercise regularily, and am contemplating starting marathon training. I used to be 40lbs overweight (happy relationship weight I put on post college), but now I am quite fit. For mental health, I post on this forum (ha ha), and work very hard at being someone I don't have to apologize for. Also, I have cats and dogs and they are supposed to be good for you. I also listen to myself and follow what I need to do for me sometimes. This was hard to learn.\n \n I think that you will find it interesting to know that despite all the above, I was just in the hospital for a kidney stone. :( It's been attributed to the chemical makeup of my kidney rather than my diet. It was a particular level of hell that Dante didn't coverl by the way, but I have discovered a method without drugs that will get the stone out faster. \n \n I really can't fathom that I used to wake up and have a couple of Oreos and a cup of coffee before heading off to class.\n \n By the way, if anyone is looking to lose weight, the above diet will do it fast!\n \n In a related note, I get so frustrated when I see people putting XXXX in their mouths that just doesn't belong there and wonder how they can eat it. Or feed it to their kids.\n If I ever have any kids, they are going to hate me. :)\n \n Cheers\n \n Cheers.",

I would think it would be better for you than organic dairy ice cream.\n\n \n Thanks!\n \n You could've implanted an IV into my body to help suck in the \"Soy Delicious Peanut Butter Zig Zag\" for awhile there, but then I learned how soy is not good for you unless it is in a fermented state like tempeh. There are, of course, folks who counter argue this, but I liken that to the dairy industry promoting how good milk is for you when it is simply not. So in the meantime, I eat very little soy products and splurge on ice cream when it's...uh...y'know...I'm a girl... :)\n \n Do you have a lot of Whole Food stores where you live? We've got Trader Joe's, Wild Oats, a bunch of little shops, and our own Kroger has a very respectable natural foods section. I'm glad it's catching on! Makes shopping easier and now I have no excuses.",

I do my best to try and weed out lies if possible, but I also like proven results. I can honestly say that switching to soy has helped me alot and a friend of mine said that his kid got instantly better when they switched her to a soy formula. \n There is a Whole Foods near my place that has been great. I use their veggies for my shakes and I've purchased alot of their cereal.",

   "Well, I will never be as hardcore as Bell, but I have made some modifications in the recent years. \n \n 1. Quit smoking!!! Not as hard as I thought it would be, thanks to the patch...(and for all of those wondering, the generic patch works just as well as the name-brand, actually sticks better too).\n \n 2. Low fat diet. Eliminated much of the fat from my diet, especially saturated fats.\n \n 3. Low cholesterol diet. Cut out much of the cholesterol in my diet, especially eggs and red meats. I still eat red meat, but much less, and often smaller portions when I do. I have discovered that chicken, turkey, and fish make great substitutes for beef and pork. Just simply using ground turkey instead of beef is a significant reduction. I also use nothing but egg beaters or the like. To me, I really do not notice a difference. Combined with a healthy intake of garlic (I love garlic) and my fiber intake, my total cholesterol level is incredibly low. \n \n 4. High fiber. I eat about 35-40 grams of fiber per day. I have always eaten a diet somewhat high in fiber, since I really like beans, vegetables, fruits, and whole grains but lately I have increased it from about 25 grams per day to 40 grams per day. I was diagnosed with diverticulitis in early March, and have since had a bowel resection. Not exactly fun, but definately a good reason to increase my fiber intake. \n \n 5. Other modifications: High soy protein from edamame, soy milk, and even soy chile. Low sodium foods and cooking. I still use salt because it is an essential nutrient, however I limit what I use. I take a daily multi-vitamin and fiber suppliment. I eat lots of garlic, ginger, onion, and varied herbs. When possible, I use herbal remedies instead of standard medications (this is from years of study of wild herbs and plants, which I pick from the wild to cook with and make teas with, something my grandmother taught me). \n \n 6. The most important thing I do: everything in moderation.",

   "I don't smoke, drink, or use marijuana anymore. I never used any of them frequently, but all of them would exascerbate the chronic gastritis I have, and depressants aren't the best thing for my declining mental health anyways. \n \n I excercise plenty as I don't own a car and walk most places. \n \n My diet isn't always exemplary but I eat loads of fiber since I tore my rectum last year and have had a hard time keeping it healed. One of my medications I have to take causes bad constipation, which was responsible for the initial tear. As you might imagine, it's quite excruciating to have an open wound in your rectum. \n \n Most of these things are not so much by choice as they are a desperate attempt to keep any other health problems at bay. I have too many already which were not things I could have avoided.",
