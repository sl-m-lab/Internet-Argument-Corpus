   "MEDIA FAKERY IN THE SERVICE OF GUN CONTROLS\n \n By William R. Tonso\n \n So NBC rigged the explosion of a GM truck. Then it faked a\n story about fish supposedly killed by loggers. What's new?\n Doubters of the gun-control panacea know from experience that\n journalistic fakery is anything but rare.\n \n Not long ago USA Today, by way of emphasizing the \"gun\n problem,\" carried a front page photograph of gang members loaded\n down with menacing guns. A few days later USA Today had to ac-\n knowledge that the young men depicted were actually taking their\n guns to the authorities as part of a gun-turn-in program, and had\n scavenged extra guns for the photo at the insistence of the USA\n Today photographer.\n \n For once the fake was caught and the media outlet quickly ac-\n knowledged it. But most media fakery in support of gun controls is\n never acknowledged. Consider these examples:\n \n After the 1989 Stockton, California schoolyard shooting, news-\n paper and TV stations showed watermelons being exploded by shots\n from a gun like the one used in that tragic shooting -- a Soviet\n AK-47 assault rifle. Not!\n \n An AK-47, at least if it is firing fully-jacketed, military-\n style bullets of the kind used in Stockton, will not explode a\n watermelon. It will simply put a hole in the melon. The\n \"exploding\" melon in the Los Angeles Herald Examiner's photo\n (which apparently inspired KABC and other channels to air their own\n melon-explosions) was actually exploded by a hollow point slug from\n an LA County deputy sheriff's 9mm pistol.\n \n The newspaper falsely claimed that the melon had been exploded\n by the AK-47. Whether the melons exploded on TV were also shot\n with hollow point 9mms is not clear. What is certain, however, is\n that they weren't exploded by jacketed bullets fired from AK-47s.\n \n This media melon scam, which helped the gun controllers dupe\n much of the public into believing that AK-47s are extraordinarily\n powerful rifles, was exposed by Martin Fackler, M.D., who was then\n the colonel in charge of the Army's Wound Ballistics Laboratory in\n San Francisco. Suspicious of what he had seen on TV, Fackler con-\n tacted the LA County Sheriff's Office. The deputies who had as-\n sisted the newspaper reporter readily acknowledged that the paper\n had credited the exploding melon to the wrong gun. The reporter\n had been told that the AK-47 would only put a hole in the melon,\n and that's all it did do.\n \n Last month, the ABC-owned KABC-TV got caught faking on another\n gun-issue. This time they were doing a special on the supposed\n horrors of 9mm handguns. They showed a film of a police officer\n firing 9mm rounds at a rapid clip, as bullets knocked down metal\n targets. Viewers were never informed -- but the police officer\n later admitted -- that the film of the gun being fired was made at\n a different time from the film of the bullets hitting the targets.\n To be able to hit anything, the officer had to fire much slower\n than he did when he was firing as fast as he could squeeze the\n trigger. By juxtaposing the films shot on different occasions, KABC\n created the false impression that a person firing a 9mm handgun\n rapidly can hit a lot of targets just as rapidly.\n \n Any regular watcher of TV news -- local, network, or cable --\n has surely seen the following scenario played out at least once: a\n man armed with a full-automatic true assault rifle is shown\n spraying a target, while a gun-control advocate explains that\n semiautomatic \"assault weapons\" have no sporting uses. The\n announcer then scoffs at the opponents of \"assault weapon\"\n controls, who supposedly want to hunt deer with machine guns. Yet\n while the film clips depict automatic machine guns, the announcer\n discusses bans on semi-automatic rifles, which can fire only one\n bullet each time the trigger is pulled.\n \n A 1989 CBS \"48 Hours\" \"assault weapon\" story faked a demon-\n stration that semiautomatics could be converted to full automatic\n in just nine minutes. Only a few seconds of the alleged conversion\n were actually aired; the gun shown which fired full automatic after\n the alleged conversion was not even the same kind of gun that was\n supposedly converted.\n \n Ed Owens, the chief of the Firearms Technology Branch of the\n Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said he \"was not aware\n that a conversion could be done in the manner shown.\" Another\n fraud aimed at convincing the public of the potential danger posed\n by \"assault weapons?\" Oh, by the way, if CBS didn't fake the\n conversion, the company committed federal felony by carrying it\n out.\n \n Yes, media fakery in the service of the gun control movement\n is anything but rare. And such fakery is likely to continue\n unabated, since the National Rifle Association doesn't pack the\n financial clout of a General Motors.\n \n William Tonso is a professor in sociology at the University of\n Evansville and a researcher for the Independence Institute in\n Denver.",

They are raised to hate firearm owners and fear firearms to a degree if not pathological it is close enough to not matter. The degree of dishonesty demonstrated by the media hack goes totally unnoticed by the viewer.
