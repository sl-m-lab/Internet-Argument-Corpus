Keep it in fantasy.\n It's like the movies, much better than real life.\n \n \n \n Oh, and many people have done psychological tests on this type of subject.\n Humans are just petty, vindictive and small minded people seems to be the conclusion.\n Did I mention I have a black heart?\n \n Anyway, this all brings a smile to my face.\n But, not as much as the one I get from caring for my son.\n BTW, both of us are playing hooky from school and work today to watch movies (seen Iron Man and Narnia) and go out to eat and hang out at the skate park.\n \n It's like what Dr. Evil always wanted with Scott.\n And when the son makes comments like \"I like being evil\" and \"I should steal more.\" it is what Dr. Evil always wanted.\n \n ;)",

I guess if you look at it as \"the best revenge is living well\" that doesn't really apply, since you will soon be dead and thus making it impossible to live well. As far as \"revenge is a dish best served cold\", this would seem more appropriate, since you will soon be ART (assuming room temperature). But the whole killing and maiming thing just really doesn't appeal to me...never has (except for dropping a few bombs, rockets, and DU AP 30mm rounds). Details, details. \n \n I might desire to steal a plane and go for a ride, but I would certainly use it for peaceful purposes (ok, might stafe the neighbors car, and dog, and roof, and BBQ grill...but hey, who wouldn't?) I would probably try to steal something fast enough to get me to several parts of the country in one day...like Boston for some chowder and to take a dump on Ted Kennedy's lawn, Florida for an orange and the opportunity to incapacitate Jeb Bush, shove a feeding tube into him, and keep him alive for an indefinite amount of time while lawyers argue about if he's persistently vegetative or not (technically, I'm not sure anyone after G. H.W. Bush can really be termed as \"alive\"...but the vegetative part should take very little time at all). Then it's off to the Al Sharpton / Don Imus reunion, to tell one of them that they are an exploitative racist who uses the spotlight to further his own causes at the expense of his audience, and the other that I think he looks funny in a cowboy hat. Last stop...a visit to Alec Baldwin's residence to have an intelligent political conversation with him, tell him that he is a wonderful spokesman for PETA and the poor animals, then canabalize him. Hey, I only had chowder and an orange...flying always makes me hungry. \n \n After such a peaceful, non-violent, and joyous day I would be content to die with a smile on my face.",
