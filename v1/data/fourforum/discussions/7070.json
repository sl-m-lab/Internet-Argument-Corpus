   "####ing \u00c5m\u00e5l (Show Me Love, 1998)\n \n Perhaps the best Swedish movie ever made. If you ever want to find out how it was to be a teenager in Sweden in the 90-ies (fat chance :p ), this is the movie you must see. The gay element in the movie is also brilliant and recflects the view of homosexuality among teenagers in Sweden at the time beutifly. I can`t recomend this movie enough, even though I suspect it might not be so rewarding to see it without being able to relate to the era and culture.\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/####ing_%C3%A5m%C3%A5l\n \n Tillsammans (Together, 2000)\n \n This is also a brilliant film made by Lucas Modyson and it has a few gay- and lesbian themes (even though this is never a central part of the movie). It`s about the Swedish 70-ies and portrays the problems of a collective household(?). When I saw it, I thought it was funny, but since I never quite experienced the 70-ies and the hippie movement, I couldn`t really relate. \n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tillsammans",
