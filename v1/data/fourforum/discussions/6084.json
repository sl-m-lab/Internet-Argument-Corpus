I would expect this to stop happening only if homosexuality becomes widely accepted (which I do expect to happen eventually).\n \n As for this child, well I don't personally see any need for mental help for a child who claims to be homosexual in order to gain acceptance. I knew people who claimed to have had sex with girls in order to gain acceptance. I knew people who claimed their grades were better than they were to gain acceptance, or who claimed they didn't study as much as they really did. I knew all sorts of people who lied to gain acceptance back in school. I don't really think it qualified as reason to send them to therapy, though perhaps there is a better way to help children make friends (not one that I can list at the moment, though).\n \n There will also undoubtedly be people who think they are homosexual, then realize they aren't, as their sexual attractions and personalities mature. Finding yourself is part of growing up, and kids will sometimes think they're someone they aren't.\n \n But mental help?

Acceptance that is.\n Now I know this is a really minor case but we do live in Los Angeles so my judgement is a bit skewed. Here it is not such a big deal anymore.\n But my son has been raised never to judge anyone by their choice.

When I met him, I wasn't interested in him (in that way) We had an so to speak, I was bashed, he took me to his place so I wouldn't be alone in my apartment. After a few days of being there, I saw him in a differnet light, we started to become more than friends. That grew for several weeks before anything happen or \"intimate\" as you would say....then it just sorta went from there.....five years later, nothing has changed except where I was really that attracted to him when I met him, now I wouldn't trade him for anything...\n \n \n Basically, You are wrong. These are only your assumptions about how s fall in love........you don't really know at all......\n \n Please visit the advocate.com, the last issue did a segmant on \"how we met\" stories......you might find that the comes way after the \"love\" contrary to the pre-assumed opinion you may have.....\n\n \n \n im sorry.
