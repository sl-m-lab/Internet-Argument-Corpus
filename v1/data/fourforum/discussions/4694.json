   "In the presidential election of 1800, the candidates were John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. This also happened to be a contest between two men who were, at the time, the president of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the president of the American Philosophical Society. Both candidates, products of the American Enlightenment, were cultured men of outstanding learning and intellect. The contest between them has been described as a coincidence very unlikely ever to be repeated in American politics. \n \n Two hundred years later the main contenders for the presidency were George W Bush and Al Gore: a cruel commentator said that the choice was between Dumbo and Pinocchio. \n \n I do not wish to scoff or throw cheap shots at the American presidency: the intellectual credentials of British politicians are hardly superior. Mr Blair, a lawyer by trade, has the reputation of being a \"lightweight\" and stays in office by means of adroit rhetoric and an \"I share your pain\" appeal to the masses. He is superficially well educated, but not a \"cultivated\" man in the sense of being well informed about science, literature, music, etc. \n \n The questions arise: Why has the intellectual power of so many western politicians diminished, apparently, so dramatically in the last two centuries ? Is this an inevitable by-product of mass democracy ? If so, why ?",
