   "Recently, the man in charge of conducting weapons inspections in Iraq has found the time to appear on MTV. I can't imagine how such an important man could muster the time for such a trivial engagement. Even more disturbing, is his idea:\n \n \"On big issues like war in Iraq, but in many other issues they simply must be multilateral. There's no other way around. You have the instances like the global warming convention, the Kyoto protocol, when the U.S. went its own way. I regret it. To me the question of the environment is more ominous than that of peace and war. We will have regional conflicts and use of force, but world conflicts I do not believe will happen any longer. But the environment, that is a creeping danger. I'm more worried about global warming than I am of any major military conflict.\"\n \n Very reassuring to know that the man, whose responsibilty was to make threat assessments about the nature of Iraq's weapons capabilities, finds the issue of global warming to be a more pressing issue than weapons of mass destruction. What a hole!\n \n There it is guys. This is the man that you claim helps make the world a safer place through inspections. If you wish to further unmask your hero go to MTV's own website for the full transcript. The longer I live, the more I think that Ayn Rand was a profit in her own right.",
