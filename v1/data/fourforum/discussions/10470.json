We somehow or another always figure out a way to blow it.\" \n \n \n \n The Democrats' resurgence \"is a result of a complete implosion of the Republican Party,\" Carville told The Politico. \n \n \"This is not like some great enthusiasm for Democrats out there.\" \n \n \n That \"implosion\" could be blamed on opposition to President Bush over the Iraq war, and the GOP scandals that have tarnished the party's emphasis on \"family values,\" The Politico observes. On another front, fiscal conservatives in the GOP have criticized their own party over government spending. \n \n \n \n But Carville cautioned: \"Democrats could still lose focus, and become what they typically do, a collection of interest groups as opposed to having a national message.\" \n \n \n \n Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg noted that Republicans \"have imploded, but the public is going to want a choice. \n \n \n \n \"My biggest worry is not what we do but what they do to try and make it an election about security.\" \n \n And Democratic strategist Joe Lockhart told The Politico: \"I worked for Michael Dukakis when he was 19 points ahead of George [H.W.] Bush, and within six weeks he was 10 points behind. So anything can happen.\" \n\n \n \n \u00a9 2007 NewsMax. All rights reserved.",

   "My question to Carville would be, if the Republicans are imploding then why does the Democratically controlled Congress have the lowest aproval ratings in its history at only 11% ? Even lower than the President whom they have worked so hard to get Americans to hate. And notice how she is carrying the water for media matters in this piece which attempts to falsely accuse both Rush Limbaugh and Talk Radio of being anti-immigration rather than like most Americans, anti-\"illegal\" immigration. Hillary helped founded that left wing attack dog organization in order to clear the air waves and pubilc opinion of any opposing perspectives and personalities who will dare speak out against her extreme and dishonest stand on virtually everything she represents politically.\n \n www.phxnews.com/fullstory.php?article=53099 \n \n PELOSI: 'HATE RADIO' HIJACKED POLITICAL DISCOURSE WITH 'XENOPHOBIC, ANTI-IMMIGRANT' RHETORIC\n Posted by Tink on Wednesday October 3, 2007 at 5:02 pm MDT [ Send to a friend ] \n PELOSI: 'HATE RADIO' HIJACKED POLITICAL DISCOURSE WITH 'XENOPHOBIC, ANTI-IMMIGRANT' RHETORIC \n \n Last night, PBS's Charlie Rose interviewed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). During their discussion, Rose asked Pelosi about her opinion of the immigration bill in the Senate. Pelosi praised several provisions of the bill, but strongly criticized the bill's vehement opponents on the radical right - especially on talk radio. Pelosi objected to their tactics saying that \"talk radio, or in some cases hate radio...just go on and on and on in a xenophobic, anti-immigrant\" manner. \n \n When Hate Radio Attacks... \n \n Last Wednesday, right-wing pundit and \"hate radio\" pioneer Rush (Oxycotton) Limbaugh declared that U.S. troops who support withdrawal from Iraq are \"phony soldiers.\" \n \n http://mediamatters.org/items/200709270010?f=h_top \n \n Limbaugh made the off-handed comment on his daily radio show while engaging in conversation with a caller about Iraq. As Media Matters first noted, Limbaugh said, \"[I]t's not possible, intellectually, to follow these people\" who call for a withdrawal. The caller replied, \"No, it's not, and what's really funny is, they never talk to real soldiers. They like to pull these soldiers that come up out of the blue and talk to the media.\" Limbaugh interjected, \"The phony soldiers.\" The caller agreed, replying, \"The phony soldiers.\" \n \n http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site_092607/content/01125113.LogIn.html \n \n ",

I also doubt he would make a good president as it is unclear if he has the ability to strong arm/compromise and a few other things that makes a good president. \n \n Don't get me wrong, I think Ron Paul has great ideas but he can't get them passed and they might even be too dramatic of a change for our country. Furthermore, his policies would probably fix our economy but send it into recession in the process...like opening a wound to clean it out....and that just isn't going to fly with an ignorant America.\n \n I still say Huckabee is the best hope because he might be able to get some things done while changing our country enough to where we can adopt ok. He has some bad ideas but doesn't come across radical like Ron Paul. Seriously, who is going to vote for someone that is a favorite among college kids? haha.\n \n And of course my rant is worthless because Ron Paul and Huckabee have maybe a combined chance of winning the nomination of 1%.\n\n \n I am still not giving up on Paul. Dean did not perform well in straw polls. He was basically a media sweetheart and that is IT. The fact he lost should not have surprised anybody based on the numbers....it was only surprising viewed in the context of media editorials. \n \n Paul on the other hand has won more straw polls than any other canidate, and has won many of them by a WIDE margin. Historically straw polls have been pretty accurate when it comes to predicting the actions of likely voters.\n \n I know that right now the biggest fear in the GOP is \"What happens if Paul wins New Hampshire\". Paul has an INCREDIBLE amount of support in New hampshire. He has won every straw poll there by 20 ponts or more. A lot of that is due to the \"free state project\", which is pretty much composed of right wingers who have moved from all over the country to NH, and they are all politically active (95% vote), which makes them a force to reckon with.\n \n If Paul can actually WIN in New Hampshire, he becomes a contender. The media will no longer be able to marginalize him and it will lead people in other states to actually take a look at his platform. Momentum built in Iowa and New Hampshire is a pretty potent tool.\n \n If he does not win the Republican nomination, I still think he can contend, and probably more effectively, as a third party canidate IF he can get into the debates. For the first time ever a majority of Americans have expressed a desire to vote for a third party canidate (65% of Americans said they would vote for a third party canidate). \n \n I still say if he can get into the race, he is a contender.

   "Wrong!!!! Want a great example of high taxes and zero economic growth?? Look at New York State, where Lunatic Liberal Democrats have run the show for fifty years!!! Is that what you want for the rest of the country?? And yet you fail to even mention the better solution, which is deep cuts in entitlement spending across the board, and reducing the Federal Government back to it's Constitutional mandates.\n\n \n If that is truly how you feel, than I am sure that Ron Paul is grateful for your support and your vote, becuase he is the ONLY canidate running on such a platform and the ONLY canidate with the history to prove it.

   "Thompson was pretty clearly planning to run on a \"I am a modern version of Reagan\" ticket. The first few days of his campaign all he talked about was the economy and how great Reagan was. Then greenspans book came out, where greenspan basically explains that Reaganomics was a disaster, Reagan was an idiot, and Bill Clinton had to try to clean up Reagan's mess, and suddenly the Thompson campaign got very quiet. \n \n He was pretty clearly going to run on the economy and on the idea of revived reaganomics but then did not think (for some reason???) that people were likely to find him more credible than alan greenspan when it comes to the US economy. \n \n I almost feel sorry for the guy. he got MASSIVE amounts of free publicity, spent a few million dollars out of his own pocket, and only managed to raise $8 million in the last quarter. Paul, on the other hand, spent about $15,000 and managed to come up with $5 million.\n \n I guess if you are going to run on a dead mans legacy, you need to make sure you are running on a reality based version of that legacy, not some pie in the sky version.",

   "Listen genius, don't ever mention Hillary and Conservative in the same breath because she is an avowed socialist. And Thompson is far more Conservative than either President Bush nor RINO Rudy.\n\n \n Thompson is no good. He just talks to the talks but has never walked the walk. For almost 4 months he has been teasing but no one knew his stance on issues. Now that he has seen the field play out we see his stances start to pop out and \"surprisingly\" he supports the things popular.\n \n Lets take a few quotes from his website: \n \nAppointing strict constructionist judges who will interpret the law, not impose their views on us by legislating from the bench. \n \n He obviously is against a first amendment right to expression then since a \"strict\" view would require that. Chances are good he means originalist like Scalia and Thomas but not knowing the difference means you are just playing to words your party likes.\n \n Or lets take his stance on the 2nd amendment: \n \nStrictly enforcing existing laws and severely punishing violent criminals.\n\n \n What the hell does that even mean? It's an empty stance.\n \n Or maybe this:\n \n [QUOT=Fred08] * A balanced approach to energy security that increases domestic supplies, reduces demand for oil and gas, and promotes alternative fuels and other diverse energy sources.\n * Investing in renewable and alternative fuels to promote greater energy independence and a cleaner environment.\n * An energy policy that invests in the advanced technologies of tomorrow and places more emphasis on conservation and energy efficiency.\n * Conducting research and development into technologies that improve the environment, especially the reduction of CO2 emissions.[/QUOTE]\n Sound familiar? It should since Bush used the same vague promise in 2004. At least Huckabee states he wants energy independence by the end of two terms (perhaps unrealistic but you can't say it's vague).\n \n Or my favorite..on health care:\n \nAmericans have the best healthcare in the world\nReally? The best? I guess nothing should be done then...excuse me while I go pay my doctor $300 to see me for 5 minutes and tell me I have a cold.\n \n \n The point of this was not to say Fred Thompson stinks as a candidate (albeit he does) but to remind us that these vague policies are the exact same things Bush did in 04 and look where that went. Bush is not a conservative and neither is Thompson. They both talk conservative to please but in reality they have no idea what to do and thus end up throwing around money.\n \n I think this is what Daewoo means by Thompson being less conservative than Clinton. I disagree because I think they are the same but whatever. \n \n As a side note Clinton is going towards that stupid \"support the Middle class\" BS. Ugh, makes me sick.",
