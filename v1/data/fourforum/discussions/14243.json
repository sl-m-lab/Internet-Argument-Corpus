   "(1.) Regardless of what gun-control laws are passed, criminals will always be able to get guns as easily as they can acquire marijuana and cocaine, because we all know that guns can be grown in fields or greenhouses. \n \n (2.) Having to register guns will inevitably lead to a complete ban on guns, just as automobile registration has led to an outright ban on automobiles. \n \n (3.) Furthermore, nations such as Switzerland, which has high gun ownership rates and strict gun control laws (and is often praised by the NRA for allowing its citizens to own assault rifles), are proof that gun control always leads to complete bans on guns. \n \n (4.) It's unfair to stereotype all pro-gunners as jingoistic right-wingers, xenophobes, or uneducated, trailer-trash rednecks, but it's OK to stereotype all gun controllers as freedom-hating \"communists\", peace-loving hippies/cowards, or just plain gun haters. \n \n (5.) We know for a fact that guns are used defensively 2.5 million times a year, as proven by Gary Kleck's very accurate study which made an estimate of between 800,000 and 2.45 million times a year (a very narrow margin of error that is not statistically significant). \n \n (6.) And of course, we all know that Kleck's study is so unbiased and accurate that its validity can never be questioned. Studies to the contrary such as the Census Bureau's National Crime Victimization Survey (which estimated that there are less than 100,000 defensive gun uses annually) are to be ignored because they come from biased sources. \n \n (7.) Private citizens can never hope to acquire firearms when gun control laws exist, but all \"criminals\" have instant connections to black-market arms dealers. Therefore, if a citizen becomes a \"criminal\" by committing a minor felony (i.e. shoplifting), he or she magically gains access to an unlimited supply of illegal firearms through the black market. \n \n (8.) Through this elusive \"black market\", criminals can acquire any types of weapons they desire, including fully automatic weapons, grenades, and rocket launchers. But despite having access to such powerful weaponry, they'll still be deterred from committing a crime by the possibility of confronting a victim who is carrying a concealed .38 snub-nose or sub-compact Glock. \n \n (9.) Sarah Brady hates guns and wants to ban all firearms from private possession, which is why she bought her son a hunting rifle for Christmas. \n \n (10.) The politicians who support gun control laws are \"socialists\" and \"communists\", such as Ronald Reagan (who has spoken in favor of the Brady Bill and Assault Weapons Ban) and George Bush, Sr. (who publicly tore up his NRA membership to protest their policies). \n \n (11.) Only people that hate guns would ever support gun control laws, which is why over 40% of gun OWNERS in America have expressed support for a gun licensing system. \n \n (12.) Handguns and assault weapons are explicitly protected by the 2nd Amendment because they are needed to fight against a tyrannical government, but tanks, fighter aircraft, helicopter gunships, and nuclear weapons are not protected for some reason. \n \n (13.) There is no practical difference between one 30-round magazine and three 10-round magazines because it's easy to reload quickly. But for some reason, it is still essential that citizens have these high-capacity magazines to defend against criminals. \n \n (14.) When gun controllers cite incidents such as the Columbine shooting as proof that more gun control is needed, they are just \"appealing to emotion\" instead of logic. But when pro-gunners say that Columbine could have been prevented if teachers were allowed to carry guns, they are making a logical, sound argument. \n \n (15.) Private citizens shouldn't be required to undergo training in order to qualify for a concealed-carry permit. They are born with the necessary skills to successfully brandish firearms against criminals, unlike police officers, who are required to train with their service handguns yet can still make fatal mistakes (20% of police officers murdered are killed with their own weapons). \n \n (16.) Assault weapons don't need to be banned because they are \"functionally identical\" to standard hunting rifles and shotguns, and thus not genuine military weapons. They also shouldn't be banned because the \"militia\" described in the 2nd Amendment needs them to defend us against a tyrannical government, and standard hunting rifles or shotguns would never be up to the task. \n \n (17.) The glorification of firearms in movies and video games is wrong and promotes irresponsible gun usage, but the gun industry's advertising propaganda, which exploits people's fear of criminals to sell guns, is perfectly responsible. \n \n (18.) Despite the U.K.'s strict gun laws, criminals still have easy access to any firearms they desire, which is why the vast majority of gun crimes in Britain are committed with air guns, blank-firing replicas, deactivated firearms, or even painted water pistols. \n \n (19.) Even if criminals didn't have access to guns, they could always use baseball bats or knives to commit crimes instead, because we all know that it's just as easy to do a drive-by stabbing or clubbing as it is to do a drive-by shooting. \n \n (20.) The only reason gun crime is so high in the U.S. is because we don't punish criminals harshly enough; after all, the U.S. only imprisons more people per capita than any other democratic nation in the world. \n \n (21.) Firearms ownership guarantees that tyrannical governments can never come to power, which is why Iraq's heavily armed civilian population was able to overthrow Saddam Hussein's reign. \n \n (22.) Criminals, being the lowlife, deviant scum they are, would never be smart enough to anticipate the possibility that their victims might be armed, and would thus never take along guns themselves. \n \n (23.) Hollywood has an anti-gun agenda, which is why gun manufacturers such as Magnum Research (manufacturer of the Desert Eagle) have often donated their guns to movie rental armories (such as Stembridge) for use in Hollywood films as a means of free advertising. \n \n (24.) Gun manufacturers such as Ronnie Barret (who has protested bans on his company's .50 caliber rifles) deserve to be looked upon as model citizens, and gun manufacturers such as Smith & Wesson and Ruger (which have supported several gun control laws) are traitors to freedom (AKA \"socialists\" or \"communists). \n \n (25.) I believe in gun control (and wrote this piece to satirize pro-gunners) because I hate guns and want to see them all banned, which is why I own guns and also enjoy reading firearms-related literature.",

Having to register guns will inevitably lead to a complete ban on guns, just as automobile registration has led to an outright ban on automobiles.\n\n \n California used their registry to confiscate the SKS after having the owners register them.\n \n \n(3.)

We know for a fact that guns are used defensively 2.5 million times a year, as proven by Gary Kleck's very accurate study which made an estimate of between 800,000 and 2.45 million times a year (a very narrow margin of error that is not statistically significant).\n\n \n 800,000 saved, versus 15,000 murdered.

Studies to the contrary such as the Census Bureau's National Crime Victimization Survey (which estimated that there are less than 100,000 defensive gun uses annually) are to be ignored because they come from biased sources.\n\n \n The odds are still in our favor. So shut up.\n \n \n(7.) Private citizens can never hope to acquire firearms when gun control laws exist, but all \"criminals\" have instant connections to black-market arms dealers. Therefore, if a citizen becomes a \"criminal\" by committing a minor felony (i.e. shoplifting), he or she magically gains access to an unlimited supply of illegal firearms through the black market.\n\n \n We don't need to buy from the black market. Therefore we have no reason to access it.\n \n \n(8.) Through this elusive \"black market\", criminals can acquire any types of weapons they desire, including fully automatic weapons, grenades, and rocket launchers. But despite having access to such powerful weaponry, they'll still be deterred from committing a crime by the possibility of confronting a victim who is carrying a concealed .38 snub-nose or sub-compact Glock.\n\n \n Do you want to get shot by any type of gun if it can be avoided?\n \n \n(9.) Sarah Brady hates guns and wants to ban all firearms from private possession, which is why she bought her son a hunting rifle for Christmas.\n \n \n So you're admitting that Sarah Brady intentionally committed a straw purchase of a firearm, especially one that can be modified and turned into a long range sniper rifle.\n \n \n(10.) The politicians who support gun control laws are \"socialists\" and \"communists\", such as Ronald Reagan (who has spoken in favor of the Brady Bill and Assault Weapons Ban) and George Bush, Sr. (who publicly tore up his NRA membership to protest their policies).\n\n \n Dianne Feinstein, Charles Schumer, Janet Reno, Bill Clinton, Al Gore, John Kerry, etc.\n \n \n(11.) Only people that hate guns would ever support gun control laws, which is why over 40% of gun OWNERS in America have expressed support for a gun licensing system.\n\n \n You've never supplied any proof that real gun owners were polled, or just what the poll asked.\n \n You can make the numbers say whatever you want to when you know how to ask, rather than what to ask.\n \n \n(12.) Handguns and assault weapons are explicitly protected by the 2nd Amendment because they are needed to fight against a tyrannical government, but tanks, fighter aircraft, helicopter gunships, and nuclear weapons are not protected for some reason.\n\n \n How about plague infested ships during colonial days?\n \n \n(13.) There is no practical difference between one 30-round magazine and three 10-round magazines because it's easy to reload quickly. But for some reason, it is still essential that citizens have these high-capacity magazines to defend against criminals.\n\n \n There's no justifiable reason for why any honest citizen should be told they can only carry so many rounds of ammunition at a given instance.\n \n \n(14.) When gun controllers cite incidents such as the Columbine shooting as proof that more gun control is needed, they are just \"appealing to emotion\" instead of logic. But when pro-gunners say that Columbine could have been prevented if teachers were allowed to carry guns, they are making a logical, sound argument.\n\n \n It worked in Israel. Or do you deny that as the truth?\n \n And why did school shootings only increase in frequency after the Gun Free School Zones Act?\n \n And why have there been no school attacks in Utah or Colorado?\n \n \n(15.) Private citizens shouldn't be required to undergo training in order to qualify for a concealed-carry permit. They are born with the necessary skills to successfully brandish firearms against criminals, unlike police officers, who are required to train with their service handguns yet can still make fatal mistakes (20% of police officers murdered are killed with their own weapons).\n \n \n We undergo training because we want to. There's no reason to mandate training. There's no constitutional room to mandate training.\n \n \n(16.) Assault weapons don't need to be banned because they are \"functionally identical\" to standard hunting rifles and shotguns, and thus not genuine military weapons. They also shouldn't be banned because the \"militia\" described in the 2nd Amendment needs them to defend us against a tyrannical government, and standard hunting rifles or shotguns would never be up to the task.\n\n \n The Heller ruling spits in your eye on this one. The Second Amendment has absolutely nothing to do with hunting.\n \n \n(17.) The glorification of firearms in movies and video games is wrong and promotes irresponsible gun usage, but the gun industry's advertising propaganda, which exploits people's fear of criminals to sell guns, is perfectly responsible.\n\n \n Criminals are real and exist in every town of every state. To deny their existence and real world threat is a sign of nothing more than mental retardation.\n \n \n(18.) Despite the U.K.'s strict gun laws, criminals still have easy access to any firearms they desire, which is why the vast majority of gun crimes in Britain are committed with air guns, blank-firing replicas, deactivated firearms, or even painted water pistols.\n\n \n The number of shooting victims are probably very thankful to know that painted water pistols are the primary choice of criminals.\n \n \n(19.) Even if criminals didn't have access to guns, they could always use baseball bats or knives to commit crimes instead, because we all know that it's just as easy to do a drive-by stabbing or clubbing as it is to do a drive-by shooting.\n\n \n London has armed their police officers in response to the frequency of drive by shootings going on.\n \n Do you simply not care if someone gets beaten to death? Is life precious only when it's lost in a certain manner?\n \n \n(20.) The only reason gun crime is so high in the U.S. is because we don't punish criminals harshly enough; after all, the U.S. only imprisons more people per capita than any other democratic nation in the world.\n\n \n We keep letting them out early too. Meanwhile Singapore has made the death penalty mandatory in cases that deal with drug trafficking.\n \n \n(21.) Firearms ownership guarantees that tyrannical governments can never come to power, which is why Iraq's heavily armed civilian population was able to overthrow Saddam Hussein's reign.\n\n \n Iraq's \"heavily armed civilian population\" is nothing more than a myth. It never existed.\n \n \n(22.) Criminals, being the lowlife, deviant scum they are, would never be smart enough to anticipate the possibility that their victims might be armed, and would thus never take along guns themselves.\n\n \n How often do criminals try and rob somebody they know or might have reason to suspect is armed?\n \n \n(23.) Hollywood has an anti-gun agenda, which is why gun manufacturers such as Magnum Research (manufacturer of the Desert Eagle) have often donated their guns to movie rental armories (such as Stembridge) for use in Hollywood films as a means of free advertising.\n\n \n Business is business. Money is money. Why else would actors like Michael Gross and Richard Dean Anderson play gun wielding heroes when they're members of the Brady Campaign?\n \n \n(24.) Gun manufacturers such as Ronnie Barret (who has protested bans on his company's .50 caliber rifles) deserve to be looked upon as model citizens, and gun manufacturers such as Smith & Wesson and Ruger (which have supported several gun control laws) are traitors to freedom (AKA \"socialists\" or \"communists).\n\n \n United we stand. Divided we fall.\n \n And the Violence Policy Center is nearly bankrupt and without members.\n \n \n(25.) I believe in gun control (and wrote this piece to satirize pro-gunners) because I hate guns and want to see them all banned, which is why I own guns and also enjoy reading firearms-related literature.\n\n \n Just like Rosie O'Donnel, or Josh Sugarmann, or Sarah Brady.",
