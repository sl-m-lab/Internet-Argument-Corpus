   "Facebook, the online networking site once the exclusive terrain of college students, will soon be opening up to the world. \n The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company will soon be allowing anyone with a valid e-mail address to sign up on the site and join a regional network. It will launch just over 500 networks in the USA and abroad, according to company spokeswoman Melanie Deitch.\n I don't know why anyone would want to compete with myspace anyway. In my opinion, myspace is overated.\n \n \nWhen Facebook first launched two years ago, it was only open to people who had valid college e-mail addresses. Last September, the site opened up to high school students. And in May, it opened up to selected work networks. Now it will be open to virtually anyone.\nWhich is something that at least 95% of the people on facebook (including myself) have been against.\n \n \nAnd that could spell trouble for Facebook, says Danah Boyd, a social media researcher for Yahoo.\n No really, ya think?!\n \n \n\"Already, the high school students, college students and corporate accounts are having a hard time dealing with each other's presence,\" Boyd says. \"I don't even want to think what will happen when Mom and Dad can join.\"\n\n \n \nThere is no date set for the expanded registration, says Facebook's Deitch. \n \n Facebook originally had planned to launch it today but decided to delay the announcement after tens of thousands of people in its 9.3-million-user network protested a different change the company made to its site last week. Last Tuesday it launched a feature that turned people's personal information into customized news headlines. On Thursday, Facebook apologized to users and added privacy controls allowing people to limit the type of information sent over the network. \n\n The guy who runs facebook honestly never pays attention to complaints of the users. There are at least 10 groups on facebook that were set up for the sole purpose of getting rid of the news feeds. Sure, the users can set up their own privacy control, but ever since this happened, you get the news feed of everyone else on your \"Home.\" So when I log on, I can see what one friend wrote on a mutal friend's wall. Privacy controls don't change that. Why should I be told what was writen on the wall? Is it about me? Are they talking behind my back? They are both friends so if I want to see what was writen, I can just go to their profile anyway. Also, I get notification when I've got a friend who added a friend. This happens wheter or not the added friend is a friend of mine or not.\n \nFacebook needs \"to do a much better job of communicating with our user base,\" Deitch says. But she acknowledges that some users may be upset by the latest plans. Users have been upset nearly every time Facebook has expanded, she says.\n\n No :xcensored!\n \n\"I find the strong possibility of another backlash,\" said Ben Parr, a Northwestern University junior who helped organize the protests against the news feeds. \"It depends on the privacy features they include.\" Deitch says there will be privacy controls. \nLet's just not go there.\n \n \nCurrently, when people sign up, they create profiles that include as much information as they want to give - everything from their relationship status to political affiliations. Each person can browse profiles of anyone on his or her network. However, they can also search for people outside of their networks - and gain access to their profiles by asking permission.\nRecently, you've been able to add religious views.\n \n \nWhile the networks are far from private, students especially have grown to see Facebook as their private homes online.\n \n And this move could make them feel like they've lost that, says Andrew Ledbetter, a graduate student at the University of Kansas.\n Unless of course the want to feel more like a stalker...or like being stalked.\n \n \n\"Many Facebook users like the site because of its traditional image of exclusivity,\" he says.\n And the facebook people just don't get it.\n \n I once said on my facebook profile (but took it out because some people would probibly just not get me or the twisted humor of it...) that if facebook wants to compete with myspace bad enough, they need the ability to do 3 things...\n 1) The ability to change the background so it's not just plain white (and the text and stuff like that.)\n 2) The ability to google images of pictures that are on people's facebook profile. I've done searches in google-image and have been linked to myspace pages where the pictures are.\n 3) You need to be able to stalk 17 year old girls who are actually 40 year old cops.\n \n \n Okay, number 3 was meant to be a complete stab at myspace. By the way, incase you haven't been able to tell by my profile, I use xanga.",
