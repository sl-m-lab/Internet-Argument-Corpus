   "Forgive me if I am being obtuse, but what is the point of the question? Even if ye grant that all human beings are born equal so what? Would that not be rather like saying all runners are equal before the start of the race? \n \n If by equal ye mean some even predisposition, I believe that this is not genetically the case. I can prove this theory by going to the beach and getting a sun burn wheras your melanin savings account may allow ye free rein in the sun. There are any number of genetic tests which would this unequality. The midget will never dunk on Karl Malone, I'm sorry to tell ye.\n \n If by equal ye mean some infinite strand of probablilities for success based on environment, random chance, etc, you would be hard pressed to guarantee environmental equality. \n \n Once a child moves from the amniotic environment and is placed on mum's lap, the inequality begins. The parents of one child are PhDs, while the parents of the other are fascinated by shiny objects. It does not take Adam Smith to determine an unbalanced equation. \n \n I hesitate to mention also the ramifications abortion brings to the equation. We really have no way of knowing if the next Einstein met a rather premature fate due to an unfortunate roll of the parental dice. So we have determined that not all pregnancies are equal, viz a viz abortion, mortality rates, etc...\n \n And yet, traveling back, and taking stock of the genetic material the parents bring we find that even conception is unequal. If your ancestors were rather slow and dimwitted, chances are they became Sabre tooth lunch before having the opportunity to develop the unique genetic pattern that would someday become ye. That being said, there are a number of people I have met in my travels who suggest that perhaps the sabre tooth's were not perfect hunters after all as apparently some rather slow dim-witted proto-folks survived. \n \n Fast forward through the ages and we find ourselves with no natural predation with the attendant increased survival rates of genetic traits that would normally be disposed by predation. As the gene pool broadens, there are progressively larger deviations from the standard. These standard deviants are, by nature, by definition, unequal. There is nothing unnatural about it. \n \n But the question remains: Should all people, regardless of ability be treated equally? This question has been answered for generations on the playgrounds of America by the adherents of the game Dodge Ball. Whether the predator is a sabre tooth or a round rubber ball, nature is a cruel judge of equality.\n \n So then, equality is not genetic, it is not mathematical, it is not natural. In theory, the only place we observe attempted equality is in society. But not all societies are equal. Society itself is replete with examples of inequality. The male teenager pays higher insurance rates than the mother of 2. The person with the low credit score receives a different interest rate than the high score holder. Inequality is just as easily self assigned as it is conferred by the society. The individual's decision making process has wide ranging implications on how that individual is adjudged by society. Is the fool and the wise man judged equally? Should they be?\n \n Equality as a societal value would appear to be a rather recent invention. The pyramids, the Great Wall of China, the American railroads; these enterprises were not constructed by a group of peers. As our own notions of equality evolve, we find ourselves in continual conflict over what constitutes equality. Why should A equal B? What is the logic? What is the value? In large part this discussion involves two parties, the one - an actual or professed lesser, the other - an actual or professed greater. The former has a natural desire to elevate where the latter sees only denegration of the self in according equality to another. \n \n As a society, we profess to value equality. At the same time, the profusion of media offerings on the \"top 100\" this or \"Worlds most___\" that, testify that in reality, it is a natural inclination to rank and to assign position to ones self and one's peers. It is not enough to know our credit score, we want to know where that score ranks in society. What percentage of the population has a higher IQ? How does the MAJORITY feel about X issue. As a social animal, it is in our nature to determine our place in society, to not settle for equality but rather strive to be the alpha.

As was said, they could have been shot on site. They could have also been given POW status and sent to Alaska for the remainder of the 'war'.\n They could have been handed over to the nations they came from.

These individuals were deprived of sleep, forced to stand in stress positions, and subjected to psychological stress techniques such as shouting and violation of personal space. Reports surfaced of collective punishment being meted out when some individuals did not perform to the expected standards. This behavior went on for weeks. Approximately 3 weeks after arrival, the individuals were gassed with tear gas in a specially designed chamber (note, tear gas is non-lethal). \n \n Now, I am not saying the treatment was not harsh, but I do not believe that the treatment was torturous, or representative of a Gulag.

I'm a little annoyed at how long the process is taking but, am happy that some of the captured combatants have been released when determined not to be a threat or to have been improperly detained. \n \n Oh, a FYI, it wasn't US soldiers 'handing' over taliban to the Northern Alliance. It was how they dealt with the POW's they caught themselves. \n Pretty much how enemy combatants were dealt with for several thousand years. If no ransom, summarily execute them.\n I'd say we've progressed quite a bit since those days when a conscience only extended to your family...if that.\n \n Now, as to advice, don't breed.\n Seriously, my conscience dictates me to say this. Don't breed.\n I'd just hate to think how you're descendents will feel when mine are munching on flavored to taste Soylent Greens(tm) and yours are gnawing on the thrice chewed bones of their neighbors and suckling marrow.\n \n But, if you'd like to ease your conscience with the contribution of funds to a worthy cause, I could send you my paypal information. For just .39 cents a day, you can feel good about yourself and how you support the America and it's military industrial complex. An institution that's been keeping the world at piece for JustUs for nearly a century.",

This view is not based upon any sound construction of the Geneva Conventions, the Convention Against Torture, or any other applicable international treaty or convention. Unlike POWs, unlawful combatants can and should be aggressively interrogated, and are entitled only to humane treatment. As any aficionado of detective novels or TV series knows, the good-cop-bad-cop routine and psychological pressure permeate the questioning of even criminal suspects and passes muster under the world's most liberal constitutions.

Length of stay in the military made longer. \n \n \nThe prisoners at Gulag Guant\u00e1namo instead\n 1. are being held against their will after being abducted\n\n They were voluntarily fighting or conscripted to do so. All who fight know they can be killed and captured. If they don't, they are ill informed or plain stupid. As you are for making such iditioc statements.\n \n2. they are being tortured under a situation where the torturers define what constitute torture or not\n\n Seems everyone has a 'definition' of what constitutes torture. Your's seems more broad than most others. Probably to cover your ignorance or force an agenda. Now, this 'torture; you define is quite different from the torture their own countrymen and compatriats have engaged in. \n Or, are you saying that duress is now equivelent to physical mutilation? \n Much like a detainmant camp is now the equivelent to a 'gulag'. Your misuse of the word Gulag is insulting to those who've been in one. Just like my use of holocaust should be insulting to those who've actually been in it.\n \n3.

There status will change. \n \nTo equal your alleged training to the conditions the inmates of Gulag Guant\u00e1namo is ludicrous and disingenuous.\n\n Not really. It's all voluntary. Just that you refuse to see simple truths. \n No one has a rigth to fight a war (legally or otherwise) and do so without fear of the consequesces. US troops know what could happen to them if they are caught. \n As Archangel and many others have stated. Those caught weren't part of a recognized gov't of the US when caught. They had no uniforms and according to the G.C. could have been killed on the spot. That they weren't and kept in decent conditions is a testiment to western compassion and mercy. That some are being interrogated for possible tactical or strategic information is common in all wars. \n \n Now, if the US simply executed those detained who had no real bearing in this conflict rather than turn them over to their countries of origin for dealing with (to face criminal charges or be released) would give you some grounds for complaint. But such isn't happening.\n You're simply covering your ignorance and agenda with tired rhetoric and empty slogans.",

It is neither socialist nor communist (as those are economic ideals) but rather a human point. There is no need to measure the value. This is where people get really screwed up (not you necessarily) in that they want to measure everything. Not everything NEEDS measurement. If people adopt the view point that each human life is valuable, important, etc, then measuring it is pointless. This is why the founding fathers said that \"all men are created equal\". In fact, that statement also includes the concept that they are equal in the eyes of their creator. Meaning that there is an outside objective influence (some call it God, the universe, etc) and that to that outside influence each has the same value. In the christian religion (the one I am most educated on along with ancient judaism) the value of a person is determined by the creator in that the creator was willing to pay the price of the life of his son for each individual. (This is used as an example and not meant to argue the relgion here. If someone wishes to argue the religious aspects please do so in the religion forum. I am simply reporting known doctrine.) Given that god was willing to pay that price even for one individual then all individuals are worth (value) that. \n \n From a more secular humanist point of view, each person has inherent value. It is simply because they are human. There is no need to determine which ones are more valuable. That is the road the Nazi's took. It is the same road that lead to slavery of the kind perpertrated here in the states. Just because the founding fathers owned slaves does not mean that they did not believe the ideal. They also believed that slaves were \"sub-human\" This is how such horrid institutions are perpetuated throughout history. \n \n If you look at serial killers, kidnappers, torturers, etc, you will find that their main goal is to eliminate any concept of self in their victims so much so that the victim becomes willing to take on whatever identity the torturer wants.

Measuring the value of something might have a purpose if people were indeed commodities to be bought and sold and if this were an economics thread. But, alas, it is not. This is a philosophy thread. When discussing the philosophical underpinnings of an argument it is not necessary that the things be measured. Rather it is necessary to determine the logic behind the argument. Logically, if some humans are worth more than others then slavery makes perfect sense. Indeed, war and poverty and sickness, and such all make perfect sense. Whether or not humans are INHERENTLY valuable because they are human is a philosophical position and not one that needs be measured like trying to determine which people to pick for your fantasy baseball team. There are statistics for that. Even then the statistics will only go so far as there are injuries and things that you simply cannot predict. That does not make the PERSON less valuable. It simply means their skill set is less valuable because of the injury. People are not bought and sold in the marketplace (or at least should not be). When it comes to working, it is the skill set that is bartered.\n \n As for the religious question you disagree with, it is a world view. It is a beginning assumption.

   "I judge value by how someone's actions and abblities can effect socity, and value can change. Are all men equal? I belive so, however is one man as valueable as another? No, everyone has thier own value set by their actions and abblities. I am making judgements about people, however I base these off of society's view of murders, druggies, ect.\n \n And in answer to your question at the bottem Astrophysicist. You are speaking of potential not value, while people's value may change everyone dose have the same potential and that is what makes us all equal.\n\n There'll always be problems until words like value, potential, equality, actions and ability are agreed upon for the purpose of discussion.\n \n Humans are born with equal worth and equal value. They neither have equal potential nor equal ability, because we are all different. What we should all have, is equality of opportunity in being able to reach our individual potential.\n \n From there, we elect representatives who will have the power to take away our rights and opportunities for the benefit of society as a whole, and/or in order to punish.\n \n So, no, we aren't all born with equal potential, as that is a relative term to the individual, but we should all be born with equal human worth, value and opportunity to reach our potential. emoticon_xgood",

   "For those who are born retarded or malformed, should they be treated as any less human? Of course not. Then as humans they have equal value and worth.\n\n Simply being treated as human doesn't translate into equality across the board which is what you seem to be implying.\n Simply not beating the retard to death doesn't mean they'll be treated any better as some others would, merely by the condition of their birth.\n \n So, we'd have to ask, what 'treatment' do humans recieve that should be 'equal'? \n This almost ties in with the respect issue. Should a person be shown respect without cause or should they earn it?\n \n \nI think you're equating value and worth with status and assets, and also comparing value and worth with physical condition. I'm looking at it in the context of common humanity, and also why I differentiated value and worth from potential. ;)\n\n Nope. I think you don't understand what worth and value mean.\n They are SUBJECTIVE.\n And subjectively they'll remain. And as subjective qualities are open to individual interpretation. The love I have for my own child could be equal to the love you have for your own. But, how we feel and express that love could differ drastically based on our own capacity. So even in a subjective = subjective stance...it's not equal.\n I could love my retard child more than you love your own capable child.\n \n So, No, nothing will ever be equal. Just like potential is never equal. \n As to having an unbiased party bake value judgements, we have that quite a bit in human history. Still no equality. emoticon_xbouncer \n \n Not even the organs and chemical composition of 2 people are equal.",
