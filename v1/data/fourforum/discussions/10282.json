He said they're using the same tactics that Hitler used to attract the youth movement and it's other followers. \n \n After watching this and watching Sicko. He's doesn't want to move to the states. He'll visit... But thinks this fundamentalist movement is incredibly dangerous.

   "Well I have to say that I think law training DELIBERATELY biased toward a Conservative Christian viewpoint does the students a disservice. US law is not biblically based and it hopefully will never be. What little I know of the lawyers coming out of these programs is less than impressive. They are not very compent. That may be because of a self-selection effect. Lawyers first of all need to be analytical, its difficult to find highly analytical people who will accept the premises being peddled by the likes of Falwell and Robetson. After all these gentleman blamed 9/11 on the sinful US culture rather than on the people who did the terrorist acts. And they blamed the destruction of NO by Katrina on the well known easy going life style of NO. Not to mention the attack of the teletubbies. Quality and excellence in education flow from the top of the organization down to the students. I don't think the people coming out of Lib U etx in law will stand much of a chanch against the best and brightest from Harvard and Yale etc.",

The hardest thing for the founders to deal with was our diversity (from the beginning mind you) and the result was a compromise allowing various belief systems to live in harmony under a secular constitution.

   "What's it to me is the confusion that results when this happens. When I was growing up ('70s-80s) there were clear-cut definitions of marriage and family. No confusion. It is only when the militant gay rights activists and their willing allies in the Democrat party and the lamestream media started this who idea of \"acceptance\" of a lifestyle choice (I don't give a tinker's damn what the Liberal \"scientists\" say) that's considered abnormal.\n\n \n The real conservative position (not neocon) would be to live and let live, and stay out of peoples' business. Why should it matter what people want to do? If the norms of family in general change over time, so what? I used to get all concerned over this kind of thing too, but really, the bottom line is that what people do is their business as long as it's not illegal and doesn't affect you personally. That doesn't mean you can't hold to the belief that it's morally wrong, but you are accountable to yourself or your God; they aren't accountable to you. If you don't believe other family arrangements are ok, then don't have one of those other family arrangements. No one is making you. \n \n I'm of the opinion that there's never going to be a time when it's not normal for men and women to marry each other and have families. In other words, that reality is just not being threatened. Other things may become more the norm than they are, but let's face it--as long as men and women are attracted to each other they're going to still form relationships and have families. Your preferred family structure is not in danger, so why not live and let live when it comes to other forms of families that exist? It's their business.",

   "Yet you conveniently forget that this country was founded on Judeo-Christian principles.

Even many names carry over! But put that aside and consider that if the US were Judeao-Christian it would have been a Monarchy built upon a specific single state religion - in other words a theocracy with a King.

They took the individual rights based ideas arising in England and other parts of Europe - extremely left wing ideas by the way! And advnaced them beyond what had been tried before, they managed to compromise the polycultural society of their day in the US (many backgrounds, religions, subpopulations, economic systems) and make a workable unity and provided the radical capability to rewrite the rules via the will of the people when the need arose. They also cleverly divided the power and the time frames of public offices to make it difficult for any one set of interests to get and keep power indefinitely! A singular achievement. Frankly I think Jefferson and Franklin would be rather proud of the youthful rebellions of the 60s and 70s etc. After all Jefferson (old radical that he was)thought we should have a revolution every 20 years or so just to keep our hand in!

   "Tell ya what AA when you can show that gay unions actually reduce fertility rates give me a call. Look my friend homosexuals only constitute at most 10% of the population of both sexes. IF all of them formed purely homosexual unions or were faithfully homosexual then the fertility rate would only be reduced by 10%. Ever mind you and if you do not allow for homosexual unions what fraction of that 10% do you think will marry the opposite sex and have more than 2.1 children per such couple? They are far more simply to remain unmarried and have homosexual relationships anyway - now I do not know if you are educated in biology but that is also not going to increase the fertility rate. But lets give your position the benefit of the doubt and say that 25% of homosexuals will have children if gay unions are banned. You now get a whopping 2.5% increase in the fertility rate. The caucasian fertility rate in the US is 0.9 notably less than the replacement rate. Even if you add a full 10% to it you get only 0.99 not the 2.1 you need. Conclusion - homosexuality is not likely to be a major issue with regard to shrinking populations. The principal causes have to be somewhere else. Its not abortion either. Maybe birth control? Maybe economic factors. Maybe the desire to have one child for economic reasons - like not enough income to afford to educate two of em? Or maybe its the Republican War on the Middle Class squeezing them so much that they cannot have a home, a car, medical insurance, WHILE supporting two kids! Perhaps the elite is simply harvesting the seeds it sowed?\n \n So unless you have sufficently convincing statistical studies which break out the multiple possible causes into their estimated contributions to fertility rate then quit making claims you have zip support for.",

Of course, myth is rooted in fact, and certain phenomena of the 1950s generated the Ozzie and Harriet icon. The decade proved profamily--the birthrate rose dramatically; social problems that nag--gangs, drugs, violence--weren't even on the horizon. Affluence had become almost a right; the middle class was growing. \"In fact,\" writes Coontz, \"the 'traditional' family of the 1950s was a qualitatively new phenomenon. At the end of the 1940s, all the trends characterizing the rest of the twentieth century suddenly reversed themselves.\" This clear-eyed, bracing, and exhaustively researched study of American families and the nostalgia trap proves--beyond the shadow of a doubt--that Leave It to Beaver was not a documentary. \n Gender, too, is always on Coontz's mind. In the third chapter (\"My Mother Was a Saint\"), she offers an analysis of the contradictions and chasms inherent in the \"traditional\" division of labor. She reveals, next, how rarely the family exhibited economic and emotional self-reliance, suggesting that the shift from community to nuclear family was not healthy. Coontz combines a clear prose style with bold assertions, backed up by an astonishing fleet of researched, myth-skewing facts. The 88 pages of endnotes dramatize both her commitment to and deep knowledge of the subject. Brilliant, beautifully organized, iconoclastic, and (relentlessly) informative The Way We Never Were breathes fresh air into a too often suffocatingly \"hot\" and agenda-sullied subject. In the penultimate chapter, for example, a crisp reframing of the myth of black-family collapse leads to a reinterpretation of the \"family crisis\" in general, putting it in the larger context of social, economic, and political ills. \n \n The book began in response to the urgent questions about the family crisis posed her by nonacademic audiences. Attempting neither to defend \"tradition\" in the era of family collapse, nor to liberate society from its constraints, Coontz instead cuts through the kind of sentimental, ahistorical thinking that has created unrealistic expectations of the ideal family. \"I show how these myths distort the diverse experiences of other groups in America,\" Coontz writes, \"and argue that they don't even describe most white, middle-class families accurately.\" The bold truth of history after all is that \"there is no one family form that has ever protected people from poverty or social disruption, and no traditional arrangement that provides a workable model for how we might organize family relations in the modern world.\" \n \n Some of America's most precious myths are not only precarious, but down right perverted, and we would be fools to ignore Stephanie Coontz's clarion call. --Hollis Giammatteo \n \n From Publishers Weekly\n The golden age of the American family never existed, asserts Coontz ( The Social Origns of Private Life ) in a wonderfully perceptive, myth-debunking report. The \"Leave It to Beaver\" ideal of breadwinner father, full-time homemaker mother and dependent children was a fiction of the 1950s, she shows. Real families of that period were rife with conflict, repression and anxiety, frequently poor and much less idyllic than many assume; teen pregnancy rates in the '50s were higher than today. Further, Coontz contends, the nuclear family was elevated to a central source of personal satisfaction only in the late 19th century, thereby weakening people's community ties and sense of civic obligation. Coontz disputes the idea that children can be raised properly only in traditional families. Viewing modern domestic problems as symptoms of a much larger socioeconomic crisis, she demonstrates that no single type of household has ever protected Americans from social disruption or poverty.

We don't want to see even one soul lost. \n \n Third, most homosexuals distort the scriptures in some fashion or another in order to try to justify their sin.
