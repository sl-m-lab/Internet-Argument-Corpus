   "I think parents need to be responsible enough to know what their children are watching; I wouldn't have a problem with a cartoon show with gay parents by any means. In fact, as you may imagine, I would encourage such a thing because I believe it promotes good values.\n \n Regarding cartoon makers, it doesn't seem unreasonable to put one's personal viewpoints into a cartoon. I'd wager that just about every single cartoon show that has ever existed has done this, but not everyone realizes this.\n \n I can understand why PBS would pull the cartoon; it would probably be bad for business, result in angry opponents of same-sex marriage complaining, and other things that might be slightly bad for business. Beyond that, the existence of gay parents in the cartoon would probably give the show a lower rating since some parents wouldn't want their children to watch the show because of that. Still, I'd rather PBS did what I consider to be the moral thing: to air the show regardless of public opinion (assuming that it portrays the gay parents in the light that they are no different than any other parents) because that would help dispell the prejudice that gay people somehow hold different values or wouldn't raise their children responsibly. But in a capitalistic society, I can't really blame PBS for doing something that is good for business, even if I don't see it as the most moral choice.",

About 2000 years of that theology rest on the belief that homosexuality is \"unnatural\".\n \n Why don't you explain why cause doesn't matter.\n\n \nWhy?? What difference does it make? Even if it were entirely psychological, I just don't see why it matters. I don't see why some people try so hard to want to believe it's environmental, and on the flipside I don't get why some are trying so hard to prove it's genetic. In the broader issue of marriage, rights, discrimination, etc. it's irrelevant whether you are pro gay marriage or against it.\n\n So, notice he asked you to justify your idea that cause has nothing to do with morality and all you did was say, cuz it just is, ok.\n \n \nI don't think it's in genes. I just had an epiphany today. I think sexual orientation comes from the primal instincts. I tried to discern what makes me attracted to men, being a heterosexual. I could easily describe character and physical traits but, couldn't put my finger on what made men so special. I came to the realization I instinctively choose men. There isn't any particular quality per se about them that attracts me. Just inborn primal instincts. I can honestly say there has never been a women no matter how beautiful I ever wanted to sleep with. Women have always been strictly friends or competition. If instincts are what cause us to be who we are sexually, then children wouldn't be at risk to become something their not. I've notice most of the boys who were molested by priests have grown up too get married and have families of their own. emoticon_xangel\n\n Ok, you just said it's not in the genes, but in your instincts.\n Where the hell do you think instincts come from?\n \nI agree. It was Bobnelson2 that was synonymizing \"Natural\" with \"biological,\" since he interjected the term.\n \n I agree with you on this. I have no real problem with the idea that homosexuality might be natural or not and I agree that animals exhibit only natural chanracteristics. There are plenty of natural behaviors among animals that I would not condone in human beings. But they are still natural behaviors. Just because something is natural or not has no bearing on the morality issue.\n\n Since humans are part of nature, everything we do is 'natural.'\n Human cloning, in vitro fertilization, processed cheese, homosexual relations, it's all natural.\n \n But, in common usage we tend to take everything that humans do and call it artificial, that way it differentiates it from everything else that we still for some reason call natural.\n \n So, if it happens in nature, it's natural. \n And I can't think of anything that happens outside of nature.\n \n \nI take it you have no problem with suicide then, in cases where the victim has no family.\n \n Or drug use.\n \n \"Hey, it's not wrong 'cause it's not hurting anybody else.\"\n\n Actually, I don't think people should be prosecuted for any drug use.\n It's a public health problem, it shouldn't be a law enforcement problem.\n \n \nyou are quite right, except that genetics doesnt put any information in our brain. they influence the way we process the information that we recieve externally, but they dont create information in and of itself.\n\n Quite not true.\n A baby knows to cry at its first gasp of air.\n It knows how to suckle.\n It knows how to cry when it's hungry.\n All that. \n There is plenty of \"hard-wired information\" pre-programmed into your brain.\n I think heavenchild up there calls it \"primal instincts.\"\n \n .",
