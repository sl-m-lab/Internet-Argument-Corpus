   "A special thanks to all of the veterans who have served this great Nation! Thank you!\n \n For all of those families who have lost loved ones fighting for our Country, Our Constitution, and Our Way of Life, we can never repay the debt that we owe you for your great sacrifice that you and they have laid at the alter of Our Freedoms! The Bible says no greater sacrifice is made than one lay down his life for another! \n \n This is the TRUE price of the very Freedoms we hold dear! \n \n Thank You! \n ",
