   "Do you have a cell phone? Are you for or against them? In what situations do you feel that they are inappropriate?\n \n Personally, I'm against them. I find them really annoying, especially in school. Sitting in a huge lecture hall taking a test, and suddenly, a phone goes off breaking all 350 students' concentration. \n \n I've found that people are much less attentive while driving and talking on the phone at the same time. I've ridden withe people like that; over the center line, then back to the shoulder, then back to the center while they try to drive and dial at the same time. \n \n They can be very rude at times too, breaking into conversations. It astonishes me that a ringing phone will take precedence over an actual person. \n \n Sure, they can be good for certain people, people who use them for work, or emergencies, but otherwise, I don't see the purpose; what happened to regular phones...or privacy?",

Land lines run $15/mo basic to $60.00 unlimited with all the cell features (call waiting, caller ID, etc.) other than email/text/camera. Only 7% of US cell subscribers with land lines have given up their land lines, effectively doubling telephone costs for those who choose both. Land line costs, due to decreasing subscription, are increasing without a corresponding increase in dropping them and going to cells. I think its mindset that parallels uncertain US economic and policy conditions. People in general, especially middle and senior age groups, fear change more than any other emotional factor.

So, you just change the number and you get rid of them.\n\n \n That has never been an issue for me but if it did I wouldn't give anyone the satisfaction of changing my number because of them. I would warn them that I would change my phone mail message to name them directly to stop harassing me or even call my carrier and ask them to block the number if nothing else worked. Think about that next time rather than inconvenience yourself and everyone that you want to have your number. :)",
