[CLICK HERE to read the full text of Elder Oaks' speech]\n \n Three days after last November's election, thousands gathered for a rally and march in downtown Salt Lake City, protesting the vote on Prop 8. Earlier Tuesday, in an interview with Church Public Affairs, Elder Oaks said he was not talking about simple opposition.\n \n \"What I mean by intimidation is when people exercise their religious beliefs and they are then fired from jobs, churches are subject to vandalism, people are coerced,\" Elder Oaks said.\n \n He likened that intimidation to what African Americans experienced during the civil rights movement.\n \n \"I would say that the intimidation I refer to in connection to Proposition 8 was not as serious as what happened in the South, but I think the analogy is a good one,\" Elder Oaks said.\n \n He also said religious values and our country's political framework are interlinked, and that losing the influence of Christianity jeopardizes our basic freedoms.\n \n \"I maintain that this is a political fact, well-qualified for argument in the public square by religious people whose freedom to believe and act will always be protected by what is properly called &#8216;Our First Freedom,' the free exercise of religion,\" Oaks said.\n \n Gay rights activists are challenging Proposition 8, which overturned same sex marriage in California.\n",

(Judge not lest you be judged and Take the beam out of your own eye before concerning yourself with the mote in your neighbor's eye).\n \n \n \nI've said it before--if gay pride groups ONLY focused SOLELY on the civil/legal aspect, and not trying to change the culture as well, they'd have gotten gay marriage a long time ago.\n\n That's funny.\n Religious anti-gay people stick their noses into gay people's lives left and right, and when we fight for equality you try to pretend it is about us influencing you.\n You don't know diddly squat about \"gay pride\".\n \n And furthermore, your claim is just absurd on another level.\n There are SEVERAL states which have passed DOMAs which go ABOVE AND BEYOND just marriage, and they prevent the state from establishing civil unions as well!\n \n If you look at the polls on gay marriage / civil unions, you will see that the MAJORITY of people who oppose gay marriage ALSO OPPOSE CIVIL UNIONS.\n Your pretense that we could have had civil unions is just ignorance.\n \n \n \nIf it's just a matter of the \"civil\" thing, then just give everyone couples' benefits and stop using something that permeates religion (marriage) to qualify for those benefits.\n\n emoticon_frazzled\n It's funny to watch Christians walk around like they think they invented marriage. Ignoring the cultures that predate theirs that also had marriage.\n \n On another level Jyoshu, I CAN DISPROVE YOUR POSITION.\n You support Loving v Virginia, right???\n That is a GOVERNMENTAL imposition onto marriage, right???\n \n And how about all those people who passed LEGISLATION to stop gay marriage???\n If marriage was just a \"religious\" issue, wouldn't all those people simply concentrate on insisting that THEIR RELIGION not perform gay marriage???\n You cannot have it both ways!\n You cannot have religious people fighting for LEGISLATION THAT DOES NOT AFFECT RELIGION, and then insist that it's \"religious\"...\n \n \n \nYou want to use \"civil\" when it's convenient, but then when it's convenient you will not hesitate to talk about it from a NON-civil standpoint (using terms like \"love\", for example).\n\n Wow.\n How dare we talk about the facts of our relationships!!!\n How DARE we not limit ourselves in our free speech!!!\n < end sarcasm <\n \n Just out of curiousity, do you have this mistaken notion that Christians have copyrighted LOVE as well?\n \n \n \nThe reality is that this 'civil' matter is intricately tied up in religion--THAT'S a lot of what's caused all the problems. But then gays don't seem to want the two truly separated leaving marriage back to the religious sector, either.\n\n Jyoshu, we typically DO NOT CARE what YOU do in YOUR religion.\n Religious matters are something your church should decide.\n \n As for what PEOPLE IN YOUR RELIGION believe, that's a separate issue.\n The fact that you may or may not have dissonance there is not the same thing. Separate issue.\n \n \n \nSo as long as gay pride groups try to invoke this religious institution (and it is!) for a type of relationship the religion forbids, there will be controversy. Many religious people simply can't, in good conscience, call that a holy marriage.\n\n WHO is asking you to \"call gay marriage a holy marriage\" ???\n \n When will you get it through your head that gay people don't care about your opinion?",

   "When a group of people's rights are on the ballot, you are damned right I do.\n\n \n This wasn't about rights at all. It was about redefining marriage in order to satisfy the demands of a grouo which insists it requires special rights in order to be whole. The current rights to marry apply to all americans equally, including homosexuals.\n \n \nNo. I live in America - I don't have to agree with you and I can say so. If you have a problem with that, you are the one that should be moving.\n\n \n Agreed, I'm not demanding that you agree with me. But I am demanding that you respect the american form of governing which that ballot initiative was in Cali. To protest, harass and intimidate fellow private citizens as a mob is a complete corruption of what our voting process represents. AND YOUR REFUSAL TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT \"FACT\" SPEAKS VOLUMES ABOUT YOUR CHARACTER AND LOYALTY TO OUR SYSTEM OF SELF GOVERNMENT. \n \n \nNeither of these ads use the lies and fear tactics that were in the ads like \"The Coming Storm\". Frankly, the first one is funny - and well, accurate. Or are you saying that Mormons weren't trying to take marriage rights away from gay Californians?\n\n \n See the bolded? A complete lie!! That first ad was both a lie and not funny in the least. It was a slanderous misrepresentation of reality. But of course that fact is lost on one with such a twisted view of what is right and true regarding any issue which opposes your warped perspective.\n \n \nHow can voting on the rights of people not offend your's?\n\n \n It would if it was taking place, but I have never seen anything anywhere which prohibited homosexuals from marrying anyone of their choice of the opposite sex just as you and I can. So where is the inequality? What you are demanding is special rights which redefine marriage and the nuclear family for all of us for all time. That is what I reject.\n \n \nAnd where does the first amendment give the right to the militantly religiously to ram rod laws based on their personal faith down the throats of all Americans?\n\n \n More lies and denials of reality in order to blame an historically and culturally accepted norm, \"WORLDWIDE\", on the religious community which had absolutely nothing to do with marriage originally being defined as between a man and a woman. It was an unspoken determination that never even had to be specified throughout the complete history of civilized nations until now. It is the loss of a moral compass which causes your ilk to abandon the values which once went without saying. It's something we traditionalists warned about a century ago, we called it the slippery slope of liberalism, and it has come home to roost since we have a complete generation of reprobates who have no concept of morality or righteous values at all. \n \n Show me even ONE Government anywhere on earth which when forming its system of Governing, whatever that type of government was, ever built into it the right for same gender marriages to be the accepted norm in their respective society? Just one Jito, go on and educate me to prove that your argument here isn't just more dishonest drivel and rewriting of history in order to make a fallacious point?\n \n \nPlus the whole \"freedom of speach\" is what gives Americans the right to pretty much say what the want - even to individuals.\n\n \n You relied on the 1st amendment as justification for what the militant homosexuals do in protesting against a private group of citizens for the way they voted in a legal election. I posted the amendment which shows that it qualifies our right to redress grievances against the government! Not protest individual americans for the way they vote. That is called political coercion, intimidation and mob rule. And it isn't how politics has ever worked in america. \n \n And if i'm wrong, then please cite other groups of private citizens which have ever targeted other groups of private citizens in response to the way that group voted in any election? Did Blacks ever converge on white churches of social clubs during the civil rights movement even though they knew very well that most all of the whites in those places voted against civil rights legislation? NO! The picketed the government and the political powers that be to voice their dissatisfaction with the status quo. \n \n I would love to run into just one of you leftists who were honest enough to admit how corrupt and un-American these scumbags actions were.\n \n \nSounds like those out of line were arrested which is good. However, I was not at these protests and will take responsibility for what happened at them as soon as you take responsibility for the actions of Fred Phelps.\n\n \n Here's the rub Jito, and thanks for bringing up Phelps cuz I almost did in my last post. Even his group didn't protest at homosexual churches in response to the Prop 8 issue, even though he knew very well that those churches were raising and spending millions of dollars as tax exempt churches in order to defeat that legal ballot initiative. \n \n EVEN THAT HERETICAL LOWLIFE understood the difference between protesting against how private citizens vote in a legal election and redressing the government in public places. But the criminals you defend have no such qualms in targeting fellow private citizens because they disagree with how they voted. And how pathetic are you for not being able to recognize that truth?

That also means we all have the freedom to not have any religion either, that should be our individual choices. \n \n So your claim that we religionists have or are taking any rights away from california homosexuals which they have previously possessed is a damnable lie because the only two times the option was voted on according to the legally enforceable california constitution, it was voted down by the majority of the people who make up the state electorate.\n\n Your first paragraph has absolutely no relationship to the conclusion in the last sentence here.\n Facts are that religious organizations gave a LOT of money to advertise for Prop 8 to succeed. Religious organizations pressured their congregations to vote to discriminate against gays.\n \n To deny these facts by insisting on \"religious freedom\" is nonsensical.\n Your freedoms end where mine begin.\n And your religion DOES NOT have a right to influence legislation, unless you are willing to allow government to influence religious policy... emoticon_ic\n \n \n \nGranted that between those to legally binding initiatives, the militant PACS attempted to force their agenda through by way of the activist courts. But since that was illegal, the second initiative took place and once again the citizens voted against the gay agenda's attempt at gaining special rights for their 4% minority which would redefine marriage for the other 96% of us.\n\n Once again, it is absurd to declare gays are getting a \"special right\", when the truth is that gays have been precluded marriage rights while EXCLUSIVELY straight couples have had marriage rights.\n \n If anything, we are talking about ending the heterosexual \"special right\" monopoly on marriage... emoticon_xagree",

   "Lol, except when you try to make your analogy to certain religious groups not allowing people to drive cars. Yeah, consuming pork is an issue too. A lot of things are a religious issue. Your religious group is interested in imposing on the freedom of gay people.\n \n \n The fact is, gays coming forward and saying they want marriage to apply to them is no different than any other category of folks of any reason coming forward. This is not about just gay marriage--it's about anyone being able to just come along and change society's understanding/standards of what marriage will consist of. The issue is whether marriage should be broadened. If it should be the sort of institution that can just change on a whim for any sort of arrangement that comes along.\n For religious people, marriage is a religious issue. You can't expect them to just sit by and say nothing and violate their own conscience.\n \n \nGays are part of the culture and in all walks of life. We cannot help but have an effect, unless we hide away in the closet. Then of course, we wouldn't want equal recognition, and that would make things easier for the anti-gay.\n\n \n Activism is more than just passively 'having an effect' simply on the basis of existing. It's one thing to simply be. It's another to make demands on society's morality. It's like straight people making an issue that they're straight. It really makes no sense; sexuality isn't the be all and end all of things.\n \n \nOh really? Why aren't you trying to take marriage away from atheists, you know, like Richard Dawkins and myself?\n\n \n I'm not trying to take away marriage from atheists OR gays. You're the one trying to change and get something in place that's not there to begin with. It's your challenge to persuade society, not mine. I'm not the one out trying to change things.\n \n \nYes, aren't we complicated as is every other human being. We want civil rights, and we also fall in love.\n\n \n I wasn't talking about anyone being complicated. It's about gay pride proponents using each when it's convenient and then saying it's NOT about the other when it's convenient. When in fact all along the civil issue is ONLY about the civil issue. The fact anyone loves another is irrelevant to policy. It's no basis.\n \n \nHa, ha. Gay people are in all these religions, whether they feel they can be open and accepted or not. Straight people alone do not have the right to a religion. \n\n \n Everyone has a right to their religion, and they have a right to speak out based on their own conscience. Sorry, but like it or not, marriage is intricately tied into the religion that doesn't approve of same-gender relations.",

   "This is just plain arrogant!\n My relationship with my partner has nothing to do with you.\n Nothing at all.\n The bible tells YOU that for YOUR religion, YOU shouldn't engage in homosexual conduct.\n\n \n That's ridiculous--your approach completely throws out the issue of religious people being able to have a view of what they feel is best for society. If people believe stealing is bad, then it's ridiculous to say \"you can't say it's wrong for OTHER people to steal, only when YOU steal.\" The fact is, religion can indeed have a view about YOUR behavior, not just its own adherents.\n \n \nNowhere does it tell you that you need to stick your nose into other people's business.\n\n \n Sorry, but saying one thinks your behavior is wrong isn't 'sticking ones nose into your business.' You can do whatever the heck you want. People can have whatever the heck OPINION they want of you or anything you or anyone else does. You don't have the right to not be offended or judged.\n \n \nThat's funny.\n Religious anti-gay people stick their noses into gay people's lives left and right, and when we fight for equality you try to pretend it is about us influencing you.\n\n \n Are you denying there is a movement to change peoples' VIEWS about gay behavior rather than JUST the civil/policy issue? There are gay-pride organizations ENTIRELY devoted to that cause. \n \n \nIt's funny to watch Christians walk around like they think they invented marriage. Ignoring the cultures that predate theirs that also had marriage.\n\n \n If, by 'marriage', you mean a property-arrangement, then sure. (shrug)\n But the funny thing is that by making a point that marriage has not had some standard throughout history, gay marriage proponents are actually using an argument that woks against them, because it equally means that marriage (by not being standard) ALSO doesn't have to be changed in the way you want it changed.\n \n \n[COLOR=&quot;DarkRed&quot;]You support Loving v Virginia, right???\n That is a GOVERNMENTAL imposition onto marriage, right???\n\n \n Why are you spending time trying to refute something I never said?\n I did NOT say govt. doesn't impose on marriage. I said \"just give everyone couples' benefits and stop using something that permeates religion (marriage) to qualify for those benefits.\"\n \n \nIf marriage was just a \"religious\" issue,\n\n \n Except, I didn't SAY it was \"just a religious issue\". I said it was a religious issue. I'm the one here pointing out that it's BOTH. You're the one arguing only one side.\n \n \nWow.\n How dare we talk about the facts of our relationships!!!\n How DARE we not limit ourselves in our free speech!!!\n < end sarcasm <\n Just out of curiousity, do you have this mistaken notion that Christians have copyrighted LOVE as well?\n\n \n Just out of curiousity, are you in the habit of asking irrelevant questions like that? I'm talking about when gay marriage proponents use things like \"love\" to argue a CIVIL issue. To talk about \"love\" in the context of a LEGAL discussion is completely irrelevant. Conversely, to talk about legalities in the context of having a RELATIONSHIP is irrelevant. You can have whatever RELATIONSHIP you want--no one is prohibiting you from that. On the flip-side, again, the merits of the LEGAL issue aren't tied into whether you love someone or not. There's no law that I am aware of that says love has anything whatsoever to do with the civil aspect. \n \n \nJyoshu, we typically DO NOT CARE what YOU do in YOUR religion.\n\n \n Unless it dares take a position gay pride advocates don't like about homosexuality. I think some of the comments in this thread about religious objection make that pretty clear.\n \n \nWhen will you get it through your head that gay people don't care about your opinion?\n\n \n I know it annoys the heck out of you, but you have no choice but caring about the opinion of society when it comes to gay marriage. If you IGNORE what many people have as their views and don't wage the PR thing as a movement, you have more things like Prop 8 happen.\n Sorry, but society doesn't revolve around you. You are no more immune to it's standards and views than any other group is.",

The funny thing is the amount of effort you do put into making points ABOUT posters rather than just to them. And so people tend to respond in kind. It's the reason you manage to pretty much tick off almost everyone you disagree with at some point.\n \n \nFor the rest of the viewing audience, I gave the link where I documented the law above.\n http://www.4forums.com/political/gay-rights-debates/11929-mormon-church-gay-issues-tax-exempt.html#post331516\n You can go to that link, and read the law for yourself.\n You can see the discussion that was had.\n I proved my position by quoting the law, and documenting the Mormon's actions in violating the law.\n\n \n No, you didn't prove it, because the way you're approaching it isn't the way people have traditionally understood the law to mean. It's sort of the way you've come out and pointed out that, even though the LAW (constitution) says that \"congress shall make no law\" in the first amendment, people don't interpret it as being limited to that. On the issue of taxation and church lobbying, you show a fundamental lack of understanding in terms of the way the law is typically understood in terms of churches. We already covered this--it doesn't mean a church can't lobby or out money toward something that they view as a RELIGIOUS issue. When that's pointed out (and it has been pointed out to you on multiple occassions) you then usually start trying to split-hairs by getting into whether it's blatantly Biblical or coming up with other examples like divorce which misses the point. Religion is obviously given latitude in determining what issues are religious--there is no over-arching standard outside of religion that says something has to be what you consider 'Biblical' to suffice. \n Frankly, if the law started being interpreted in the way you're approaching it with this 'gotcha' thing, it would be a FUNDAMENTALLY huge change from the way our whole HISTORY has gone. People that hate church-folk involvement in govt. have tried this tact for ages. It hasn't worked for the most part, because the law isn't typically interpreted the way you're trying to do it. Moreover, people aren't automatons when it comes to churches. Individuals CHOSE to give their money to this cause; the LDS didn't threaten them or force them to do so. \n I can't help but wonder, how many things are people going to try to come up with like this out of anger over Prop 8? \n Gay marriage lost on this one.\n Trying to come up with all these technicalities in the wake of it is getting nowhere. \n \n \nWhen we are talking about a GOVERNMENTAL LAW, that is NOT a \"religious issue\".\n\n \n Then you should be trying to separate the issue in ALL areas. Why are you not out to, say, remove the status of ministers to be able to sign marriage licenses, if this is really such an issue for you?\n \n \nI do get that the REASON that motivates anti-gay people is religion.\n Amusingly enough, if you could think back and recognize our history accurately, I routinely have been trying to get you to admit that the anti-gay prejudice is typically brought on by religion.\n\n \n In the sense of \"prejudice\" in a non-malevolent-intent sense, then sure. \n But you have never proven religious belief truly leads to bigotry.\n \n \nBut just because they are MOTIVATED by religion doesn't mean that their action is not political.\n\n \n So?? \n Again you're trying to rebut something I never said. Again, I'm not saying it ISN'T political. I'm saying it's religious. \n Do you get that to say something is one thing is not the same as saying it's NOT something else?\n \n \nNote? It doesn't say \"it's okay if it's religious\".\n It talks about INFLUENCING LEGISLATION, and I don't care how much you think it should be declared \"religious\" you cannot escape the fact that \"influencing legislation\" is EXACTLY what the Mormon church was doing.\n\n \n Wow! No one here is saying they weren't trying to influence legislation! Are you reading some imaginary thread??\n \n I'm saying you haven't shown that the law should be interpreted in a way that says that they're not allowed to do that when it comes to religious issues. \n Geeez!!\n \n \nI still hold that it is a political issue.\n\n \n And I still hold that the earth is round.\n Oh wait ... no one was arguing against THAT, either ... emoticon_rolleyes",
