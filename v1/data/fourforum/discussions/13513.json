   "Socialism (def)\n 1 : any of various economic and political theories advocating collective or governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods\n \n Now, tell me, how is this NOT socialism? emoticon_confused\n \n \n\n \u0095 OCTOBER 29, 2009 \n Politicians Butt In at Bailed-Out GM \n By NEIL KING JR. \n Montana Rep. Denny Rehberg was no fan of the $58 billion federal rescue of General Motors Co., saying he worried taxpayer money would be wasted and the restructuring process would be vulnerable to \"political pressure.\" Now the lawmaker says it's his \"patriotic duty\" to wade into GM's affairs.\n Along with Montana's two Democratic senators, the Republican congressman is battling to get GM to reinstate a contract with a Montana palladium mine nullified in bankruptcy court. \"The simple fact is, when GM took federal dollars, they lost some of their autonomy,\" Mr. Rehberg says.\n Federal support for companies such as GM, Chrysler Group LLC and Bank of America Corp. has come with baggage: Companies in hock to Washington now have the equivalent of 535 new board members -- 100 U.S. senators and 435 House members.\n Since the financial crisis broke, Congress has been acting like the board of USA Inc., invoking the infusion of taxpayer money to get banks to modify loans to constituents and to give more help to those in danger of foreclosure. Members have berated CEOs for their business practices and pushed for caps on executive pay. They have also pushed GM and Chrysler to reverse core decisions designed to cut costs, such as closing facilities and shuttering dealerships.\n \n \" The 535 new board members is exactly the reason I will never buy a General, I mean Government Motors vehicle. \"\n - Richard Cummings \n \n Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota persuaded GM to rescind a closure order for a large dealership in Bloomington, Minn. In Tucson, Arizona Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords did the same for Don Mackey, owner of a longstanding Cadillac dealership with 80 employees. Rep. Giffords argues it made sense, even for GM, to keep the Mackey dealership, which sold 750 cars last year. \"All I did was to help get GM to focus on his case,\" she says.\n Lawmakers say it's their obligation to guard the government's investments, ensure that bailed-out firms are working in the country's interests and protect their constituents.\n Executives say congressional demands gobble up time and make a rocky business environment even more unpredictable. Bank chief executives say incessant calls from Capitol Hill, combined with threats of legislation, were among the main incentives for them to pay back money injected by the government and escape Washington's clutches.\n Thomas Geisel, chief executive of New Jersey's Sun Bancorp Inc., says the bank paid back its federal money in June because of legislation that imposed limits on bankers' pay, among other areas. \"Lawmakers let emotion and ego get in the way of making good business decisions,\" he says.\n Probably no company has been more on the receiving end of congressional attention than GM, whose widely scattered factories, suppliers and dealership network put it in touch with nearly every U.S. congressional district. After committing $58 billion to keep the company afloat, the federal government took a 60% stake in the auto maker when the slimmed-down GM emerged from bankruptcy.\n In May, even before the government's ownership became official, lawmakers erupted when GM disclosed it planned to produce a new subcompact car at its factories in China. Under congressional pressure, GM dropped those plans and promised instead to retool an existing U.S. facility in Michigan, Wisconsin or Tennessee for the new model.\n Politicians Butt In at Bailed-Out GM - WSJ.com\n \n",

   "How is warrantless wirtetaps not facism?\n\n \n Not only is it not facism, it is Constitutional and has been practiced in the past.\n \n\n \n More than a year before the attack on Pearl Harbor, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt authorized the FBI to intercept any communications, domestic or international, of persons \"suspected of subversive activities . . . including suspected spies.\" FDR did not hesitate long over a 1937 Supreme Court opinion (United States v. Nardone) interpreting federal law to prohibit electronic surveillance without a warrant. It is too late to do anything about it after sabotage, assassinations and 'fifth column' activities are completed,\" he wrote in a secret 1940 memo authorizing the wire tapping. Indeed, he continued to authorize the surveillance even after Congress rejected proposals from his attorney general, Robert Jackson, to authorize national security wiretapping without a warrant.\n \n Every federal appeals court to address the question has agreed that the president may gather electronic intelligence to protect against foreign threats. This includes the special FISA appeals court, which in a 2002 sealed case upholding the constitutionality of the Patriot Act held that \"the President did have inherent authority to conduct warrantless searches to obtain foreign intelligence information.\" The court said it took the president's power \"for granted,\" observing that \"FISA could not encroach on the President's constitutional power.\"\n John Yoo: Why We Endorsed Warrantless Wiretaps - WSJ.com \n",

   "Not only is it not facism, it is Constitutional and has been practiced in the past.\n\n \n No, it is not constitutional, nor has this been practiced in the past. \n \n You have to be careful reading Yoo because he was one of the slimebag lawyers writing \"I know it is BS but should pass as due diligence\" opinions for the president.\n \n For example, where he says \"Every federal appeals court to address the question has agreed that the president may gather electronic intelligence to protect against foreign threats.\" what he specifically does NOT say is that they have found warrantless wiretaps to be constitutional because NONE have. He is correct that every single court (not just appeals courts) that has looked at this has agreed that the president may gather electronic intelligence to protect against foreign threats, just like the FBI may gather electronic intelligence to protect against domestic threats. Their ability to do so is NOT absolute.\n \n Even in his own article he admits that FDR IGNORED a supreme court decision that explicitly stated that warrantless electronic wiretaps were illegal...even if he was looking for spies. And that was NOTHING like the Bush administration set up. In the case of FDR they were talking about wiretaps on specific individuals that they had reason to believe were engaged in specific espionage activity. We have had several people from the telcos state in no uncertain terms that the ONLY reason that the NSA would have to set up the way they did is if they intend to do MASS monitoring of all the network activity. \n \n The only normal court to rule on this at all was a district court in michigan (6th district) where the judge called the Bush administrations argument \"silly\" and \"frivilous\" (which has a REALLY serious meaning in a court room). \n \n That case was later dismissed by the appeals court NOT because the court ruled or believed that the warrantless wiretaps were legal but rather because they basically said that since the people involved could not show clearly that they had been harmed by one of the warrant less wiretaps that they had no standing to bring the case to trial. \n \n The only court that HAS found the program to be constitutional was the FISA court, which is in and of itself unquestionably unconstitutional, and we only have half their finding and have absolutely NO idea what the case was about because it is all secret. We DO know that the finding that they DID release is in DIRECT contradiction to 407 US 249 (supreme court case that is the law of the land in these matters) which found:\n \n \n2. The Fourth Amendment (which shields private speech from unreasonable surveillance) requires prior judicial approval for the type of domestic security surveillance involved in this case. Pp. 314-321; 323-324.\n \n (a) The Government's duty to safeguard domestic security must be weighed against the potential danger that unreasonable surveillances pose to individual privacy and free expression. Pp. 314-315.\n \n (b) The freedoms of the Fourth Amendment cannot properly be guaranteed if domestic security suveillances are conducted solely within the discretion of the Executive Branch, without the detached judgment of a neutral magistrate. Pp. 316-318.\n \n (c) Resort to appropriate warrant procedure would not frustrate the legitimate purposes of domestic security searches. \n\n \n The FISA court got around that by saying that the purpose of this was to protect from FOREIGN threats, not domestic ones, but do you really have to be a lawyer to recognize that if they are talking about protecting against attacks IN the US being carried out by people who are already here, that is no longer a foreign threat, it is a domestic one (and the supreme court case I cited above was about EXACTLY that). \n \n The truth of the matter is that what they were doing and how they were doing it (sitting on the main telcos fiber trunks) they could ONLY listen to calls where one party was in the united states. The really inconvenient part of the whole damn argument is that AT&T started setting up their interconnect facilities for the NSA seven weeks BEFORE 9/11 even happened. \n \n Come on, JP, I know it is easy to get caught up in the partisan BS, but surely you are not so far gone as to believe for even one minute that warrantless wiretaps are somehow legal????",

In his rise to power and during the course of the governments economic takeover of Italy, Mussolini used unions extensively as a pre-formed support network. After the conversion of the Italian economy to his \"Corporate State\" he argued (somewhat successfully) that unions were superfluous because now that the corporatist model was in place the state looked out for the interests of the workers and to oppose the state (which is all a union would be doing) was paramount to treason. \n \n What they have done at GM (and to some degree with the banks) is not very far off. They have certainly demonized the employees at the bank that have demanded they receive the \"bonuses\" that their contracts require or even those who have accepted them (and if a bonus is contractually required it is actually a \"bonus\".....in my world we call that \"salary\"). \n \n They certainly have not been shy about using their power to push the union around at GM. \n \n \nWhat's perhaps confusing is that many (most?) self-styled leftists, marxists and socialists in America are fervent in their support of Obama, not that this is atypical for fascist regimes. The nazis quickly co-opted most of the left-socialists once they gained power.\n\n \n That is because people are stupid, have no idea how our economy works, certainly have no idea how other economies worked, and have the attention span of a fruit fly. Oh, look....something shiny.......\n \n \n Ok, I'm back now. \n \n People listen to what the guys in washington say and cant seem to latch on to the idea that it is a all a bunch of BS. They are masters at framing things so the common man feels like he has a handle on them. The bank bailouts are a good example.\n \n First, the term \"bank bailout\" is misleading. Where did the money go and whose wealth did we ultimately conserve? The answer is not \"the banks\" because a bank is an artificial construct and we are talking about the people whose wealth we preserved. In reality we conserved the wealth of about a million people. The other 299 million of us got the shaft, but those million were in good shape and dodged the bullet.\n \n Second, we were told repeatedly that they HAD to do the bailouts because if they did nothing the entire system would have crashed. Do you see the problem with that???? It is a masterful logical fallacy because it assumes that those were the ONLY 2 options and they CERTAINLY were NOT. That WAS the only option that passed 100% of the cost of the mess on to the other 299 million of us, but it was CERTAINLY not the only way the situation could have been handled.\n \n Third, another publicity lie. \"We had to do this in order to preserve the flow of consumer credit\". That one caught the attention of a lot of americans who are XXXXXX and rely on their credit cards to pay their bills every month (since living within your means is SO last decade) and who REALLY feel like they need to borrow $50,000 to buy an 11,000lb pickup truck to take to the supermarket to buy milk. When people saw their new truck potentially vanishing they sat up and took notice. The thing is, consumer credit was never really threatened. Even if they had seized and liquidated all the failed banks, consumer credit woudl have continued to flow. Most people are pretty hazy about where credit comes from or why it is there, so they dont realize that those consumer loans are actually EXTREMELY profitable for the banks and they cost the banks basically nothing to produce.\n \n Your average american cannot tell you the difference between socialism and communism and many who CAN are unable to apply that knowledge in daily life. You cant expect them to understand boring things like how a fascist economic system works, or even how capitalism works. That is nerd stuff.",

The first thing the government did when they took over GM was pull concessions from the union that they were never willing to give before essentially by using the same tactics that Mussolini did....WE are looking out for you now and opposing us is anti american. \n \n The GM situation is interesting/unique in that no matter how it played out, the union was going to end up owning a large portion of GM so you end up in a completel screwed up situation where there is no legal way for the company to be run (since e union leadership has a fiduciary responsibility to the union members while GM board members have a fiduciary responsibility to the shareholders). \n \n \n1. The Employee Free Choice Act makes secret ballots \"optional\" allowing union organizers to intimidate those that go against them. \n\n \n I agree.

This absolves labor unions of 10's of billions of dollars of long-term debt that would bankrupt the unions and weaken organized labor across the country.\n\n \n This is one of those \"good for the goose good for the gander\" thing. IMO nationalized health care is maybe the one, single thing that Obama is right on. Nationalized health care will remove trillions of dollars in liabilities from US businesses and we HAVE TO do that if we want US companies to be competitive in the world market. I disagree that it would strengthen unions, though. Think about how much of the GM bankruptcy discussion and how much of the UAW talks have been geared toward the health care side of that and the unfunded liabilities there. If we had nationalized health care all that goes away. A decent health care plan is a MAJOR sellign point when it comes to union membership. Take it off the table and you have weakened unions. \n \n \n3. Cap and Trade is a confiscatory program designed to give Uncle Sam a new revenue stream for its social engineering programs, control industry's direction and allow for protectionist tariffs on imports from China under the guise of CO2 emissions. This clearly favors US industry and US Unionized labor.\n\n \n Again, good for goose, good for gander. Get on Ebay and see how cheap you can buy stuff that comes from hong kong. What is interesting is to order some stuff, disassemble it, and run the part numbers inside and see what US companies are charging for the EXACT same item in a different case. I ordered some VHF radios from ebay (hong kong seller) for $89. Pulled them apart and ran the numbers off the boards through google and they show up as OEM replacement parts for a $3000 Motorola 2 way radio. \n \n Cap and trade is certainly an unfair, uncapitalistic scheme that is most likely based on BS science and cooked data. It is NOT a plot to buoy unions, though, it is a plot to artificially buoy developed countries and protect our businesses. Granted that is certainly likely to work out to be a boon for US workers as well (but with disastrous consequences likely in the end). \n \n \n \n \nIsn't that the plan for the Wall Street bailout? Uncle Sam thinks it can actually make money selling some of its \"bailed out investments\".\n\n \n Not so much. First, there is no possible way they are going to make money on this. That was a lie that Geithner has been telling and is based on the idea that people are too stupid to realize that we had to borrow the money we loaned them so interest is being charged on it. \n \n This is one of those what is being aid vs what is being done things. Based on what has been SAID, the government may make some money but EVERY SINGLE program they have come up with so far since the start of this mess has been structured to make that virtually impossible, also structured to ensure that the taxpayer is taking the lions share of the risk. \n \n \nI see the difference, but that's not what Obama is trying to do. He got us to buy the pig at a firesale and is hoping to make money selling it back to the original farmer or give it to the fieldhands.\n\n \n No, he bought the pig at a fire sale then provided the original owner with a new house, fields, and stock at government expense, then if the original pig is any good at all he will give that back to the guy as well.",

That was one of the few smart moves the government made in the deal, IMO.\n \n\n The GM situation is interesting/unique in that no matter how it played out, the union was going to end up owning a large portion of GM so you end up in a completel screwed up situation where there is no legal way for the company to be run (since e union leadership has a fiduciary responsibility to the union members while GM board members have a fiduciary responsibility to the shareholders). \n \n\n It does make the company an interesting study in dichotomy, I'd agree. \n \n\n I agree. The other side of that coin is that it allows companies to retaliate against people who vote to go union. \n \n\n Do you really think that happens in the auto industry today? Not likely, trust me. \n \n\n This is one of those \"good for the goose good for the gander\" thing. IMO nationalized health care is maybe the one, single thing that Obama is right on. Nationalized health care will remove trillions of dollars in liabilities from US businesses and we HAVE TO do that if we want US companies to be competitive in the world market. I disagree that it would strengthen unions, though. Think about how much of the GM bankruptcy discussion and how much of the UAW talks have been geared toward the health care side of that and the unfunded liabilities there. If we had nationalized health care all that goes away. A decent health care plan is a MAJOR sellign point when it comes to union membership. Take it off the table and you have weakened unions. \n \n\n \n It strengthens the unions by NOT bankrupting them. Given the alternative of their membership finding out that they squandered a large % of their retirement funds, national healthcare removes $Billions in liabilities, that were just prefunded using now-worthless stock when the Big Three offloaded them, from the union's pockets.\n \n\n Again, good for goose, good for gander. Get on Ebay and see how cheap you can buy stuff that comes from hong kong. What is interesting is to order some stuff, disassemble it, and run the part numbers inside and see what US companies are charging for the EXACT same item in a different case. I ordered some VHF radios from ebay (hong kong seller) for $89. Pulled them apart and ran the numbers off the boards through google and they show up as OEM replacement parts for a $3000 Motorola 2 way radio. \n \n\n \n I'm not isolationist. If Hong Kong can make it better and cost less, then we're fools to pay more. But, that isn't how Obama thinks. He's already demonstrated that he's willing to spend $24k of taxpayer money to sell ONE new car in his Cash for Clunkers debacle. \n \n\n Cap and trade is certainly an unfair, uncapitalistic scheme that is most likely based on BS science and cooked data. It is NOT a plot to buoy unions, though, it is a plot to artificially buoy developed countries and protect our businesses. Granted that is certainly likely to work out to be a boon for US workers as well (but with disastrous consequences likely in the end). \n \n\n I agree that its primary purpose is global wealth redistribution. That's unquestionable. But, if it can also be used to establsih plausible protectionist policies that won't get the US in trouble with the WTO, it's union gravy. ;)\n \n\n Not so much. First, there is no possible way they are going to make money on this. That was a lie that Geithner has been telling and is based on the idea that people are too stupid to realize that we had to borrow the money we loaned them so interest is being charged on it. \n \n This is one of those what is being aid vs what is being done things. Based on what has been SAID, the government may make some money but EVERY SINGLE program they have come up with so far since the start of this mess has been structured to make that virtually impossible, also structured to ensure that the taxpayer is taking the lions share of the risk. \n \n\n I agree that you can't buy $1Trillion in toxic assets and turn a profit, but that's the hype being spouted.\n \n\n No, he bought the pig at a fire sale then provided the original owner with a new house, fields, and stock at government expense, then if the original pig is any good at all he will give that back to the guy as well.\n\n \n But the above scenario still isn't fascist economic theory. It's pure, unadulterated theft.",

   "There is value add at an individual level but not on a macroeconomic scale. Granted you are only looking at 2-3% overall, but that is still hundreds of billions of dollars per year system wide. \nWell you can say that about a lot of industries. I don't think the profits are that high. Net Income for United Health Care was less than $3 billion last year..for example. And the total for the industries top performers was less than $10 billion (much less than 2% of 2.5 trillion). You might be referring to revenues which was in the hundreds of billions.\n \n \nBAck in the real world, if we want to decrease costs we are going to have to be willing to go head to head with the AMA, the insurance companies, the drug companies, pretty much everybody. Right now if I go to the doctor it costs me nothing and my insurance company pays $54 for the office visit. If I send somebody to the SAME doctors office for the SAME thing (a DOT physical) but there is no insurance, it costs me $128. That is not just a \"volume discount\". My doctors office is required by contract with the several insurance companies that they work with to charge a percentage more (in once case it is 100% more) for uninsured office visits. The doctors office is OK with this because they know that other doctors have the same stipulations in THEIR agreements so the increased price does not lead to a competitive disadvantage. \n \n In any other industry this would have the feds at your door to discuss your monopolistic price fixing scheme. In health care it is business as usual.\n \n Our politicians are not going to be willing to go to war with the folks they would need to in order to fix this mess.\nAmong other examples reasons why costs are so high. But again, this is why I think it is delusional to just pick one and call them the villain. If you \"fix\" the problem with the health insurance industries you still have dozens of other problems keeping the price up. As they say, no one rain drop feels it is responsible for the flood.",

   "BUT, that is where there is the political will to start. \n \n I am not saying that insurance is the BEST place to start, merely that it is the logical place given the circumstances we are facing. There are a LOT of places that we need to kick some heads in. \n \n My family is on an HSA/high premium health plan. It is really not a bad setup (one of the things I think Bush did right). The first $2500 of health care costs in any year are ours to cover and then the insurance company picks up 100% after that. It actually ends up being MUCH cheaper than an HMO and that is AFTER I max out our tax free HSA contribution every year. \n \n I take blood pressure medication. I get it at Walgreens. It costs $36/month and I pay for it out of pocket because we are not over our $2500 cap. I happen to know, since the people at Walgreens are XXXXXX who can not keep their computers under control, that if I did not have insurance it would cost $98 per month. Why? Because my insurance company had snagged a discount for their members even if they are not covering the cost of the pills. The girl in the pharmacy says Walgreens is still showing a good profit at $36/month. \n \n Correcting discrepancies like that is important if we want to do something meaningful about health care costs but the political will does not exist right now to go to war with the corner drug store on their pricing structure.\n\n I'd agree with this. I suppose you are pretty pumped that the current bill(s) in Congress address this head on and don't further these problems by creating more ways for insurance companies to monopolize and price fix.

   "Hey! I recall it that when there was a talk about secret CIA prisons in Europe people failed to believe it. Now you just can't deny facts, there was a secret CIA prison built inside a riding academy. And it was basically thanks to Mecys Laurinkus, ex-head of Lithuania's spy agency, that the prison had been built there. Now that the scandal can't be smother up Laurinkus will be accountable! Did he really think he could wait out a storm staying in Georgia as Lithuanian ambassador? Huh, how naive of him! He's been already dismissed (w w w alfa.lt /straipsnis/ 10304745/ ?Ambassador.to.Georgia.fired.by.Lithuanian.President.over.CIA.prison.scandal..sources=2009-12-15_23-11 Ambassador to Georgia fired by Lithuanian President over CIA prison scandal (update) - Naujien? portalas Alfa.lt). \n \n By the way, do you know what is also said about Laurinkus? Do you know what he's been doing when in Georgia? He is said to be giving consultations to interested persons in Saakashvili's entourage of everything that has connection to secret prisons.
