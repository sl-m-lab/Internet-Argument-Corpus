   "Jackson: War in Iraq crime against life\n Source: Boston Herald \n Publication date: 2004-04-04\n \n \n The Rev. Jesse Jackson said yesterday that the United Nations should consider sanctioning the United States for its decision to \"murder all these people on faulty information\" by waging war in Iraq. \n Speaking in Boston on the eve of the anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination, Jackson said the word \"murder\" was appropriate - if inflammatory. \n \n \"When you kill people outside of international law, I'm not sure what you should call it,\" the civil rights leader said. \n \n Jackson later called the U.S. invasion of Iraq \"a crime against humanity.\" \n \n \"Iraqis are human beings, too. We killed them, . . . we executed people on this flawed policy,\" he said. \n \n Jackson was in the city for a series of events, including delivering an address to the annual 21st Century Black Massachusetts Conference at the John B. Hynes Veterans Memorial Convention Center. His speech focused on eliminating the Electoral College. A constitutional amendment Jackson and others are pushing also would give the District of Columbia seats in Congress. \n \n But it was during conversations with reporters before his formal talk that Jackson delivered his harshest comments. \n \n A U.N. investigation into the Iraq war is warranted, he said, because the United States is acting as \"our own referee, judge and jury in this action.\" \n \n \"I'm not sure the U.N. has the power to act against us in a miltary way, but they have a right to make a moral judgment,\" he said. \n \n \"As when other nations violate the law, we should have hearings,\" he said. \"Then, actions are determined.\" \n \n \"To whom are we accountable for engaging in such attoricities?\" he asked. \n \n Even if no sanctions are imposed, Jackson said, the United States should \"apologize\" to the survivors of Americans and Iraqis who have been killed in the conflict. At home, he said, Congress should determine whether President Bush committed an impeachable offense in making his case for war. \n \n But senators should not be held responsible because their vote authorizing war in Iraq merely gave the Bush administration the ability to pursue military action, Jackson said. \"Congress gave him the option. It was his judgment.\" \n \n It just never ceases to amaze me the lunatic fringe parade of fools and thier politicalization of the war. I ask you \"reverend jackson\" Who should apologize to the 400,000 dead iraqis under husseins regieme? hmmm?",

   "Jesse Jackson's always issuing a grievance or griping about imperfections in society. Although I agree to some extent that our choice to go in there unsupervised or without any aid from the U.N. was a bit foolish and our zeal was a bit too great, I can't agree that this is homocide. However, this is the result of faulty intelligence and being too hasty and impatient. This war was not about liberating a people, but acted as a pillar to our image, incited some reverence in some countries and was used as a ploy to broaden our military influence. Still, I think it was a good thing to ouster Saddam Hussein. No country should have to sustain tyranny of that magnitude. However, I'm curious as to how America thinks we're going to successfully implement a new \"democracy\" without making the mistake of electing a brand-new despot for this sovereign nation. I'm also perturbed by the levels of violence in Iraq and I fear that this civil unrest is only worsening. al-Qaeda's really made things hard for our men.",

His approach is so problematic, and he always has to point the finger. I give no credence to anything Jesse Jackson says.",
