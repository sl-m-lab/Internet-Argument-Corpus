I understand you are saying \"some\" people, but I don't think most people I was aquainted with fit the description either.\n \n I'll chalk it up to naivete. It was a big world I found myself in, confusing too. It may have been my attempt to find a father figure who could help guide a young man.

Many of the websites for \"born again\" churches have testimonials from those who have been \"Saved\". It seems to me they all had some emotional issue their were working on fixing. It does seem alot of substance abuse, low self-esteem and emptiness comes into play in one's process of being born again. I feel that some people who become \"Saved\" needed to be saved.\n \n \n I think when you look at some of the extreme christians who seem to abandon logic, they seem to be either addicted to the idea of salvation or addicted to the scriptures themselves. \n \n I would be interested in hearing why some of those in here became \"born again\" and why it means to them now.",

That finally got them to relent after weeks of this stuff.\n\n \n These kinds of stories bear witness to why many professing Christians are non-denominational. More than an Evangelical type church, you are describing one of the Pentecostal denominations. They hold that our church today began on the Day of Pentecost, which is described in Acts 2 of your Bible. Peter was preaching the 'gospel of the kingdom' (Matt. 4:17 (23), 9:35, 24:14, Acts 8:12) in those verses, and NOT our gospel for today. I explain the difference here:\n \n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=2509\n \n The differences between the Kingdom baptisms (3 of them) and our 'one baptism' (Eph. 4:5) is explained here:\n \n http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=2506\n \n \nPNAC << So, when someone gets born again, are they supposed to feel something?\n\n \n (The remainder of this post will make sense if you read the above ones first.) \n \n Absolutely not. We are saved today by hearing and believing the good news that Christ died for our sins, was laid in a tomb, and God raised Him from the dead on the third day (1Cor. 15:1-4). When we hear the message of truth, \"the gospel of your salvation--having also believed, you were sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is given as a pledge of our inheritance, with a view to the redemption of {God's own} possession, to the praise of His glory.\" Eph. 1:13+14. \n \n Paul writes, \n \n \n\"For in hope we have been saved, but hope that is seen is not hope; for who hopes for what he {already} sees? But if we hope for what we do not see, with perseverance we wait eagerly for it.\" Romans 8:24+25.\n\n \n \nPNAC << Are they supposed to know the exact moment when the holy spirit enters their soul?\n \n \n No, but they pretend to know, as if a man can see the Spirit of God with human eyes. Go back into your childhood story and remember pretending to feel something, because everyone else wanted you to share in this experience. That is the effect of the 'deluding influence' of 2Thes. 2:10-12. This part will only make sense, if you went back and read the Gospel post above. They have mixed together the precepts of the gospel of the kingdom (#1) and Paul's gospel (#2) to create a different gospel (#3). Therefore, they are not preaching the first nor the second, but they have invented one of their own. \n \n \n\"For this reason God sends upon them a deluding influence so that they will believe what is false, in order that they all may be judged who did not believe the truth, but took pleasure in wickedness.\" 2Thes. 2:11+12.\n \n \n Instead of being part of the 'mystery of Christ,' they have become part of the 'mystery of lawlessness' (2Thes. 2:7), and have been baptized into the body of the antichrist. Therefore, if you could go back in time and sit among the members of that congregation, then you would be in the midst of a people sharing in a common deluding influence. That is why you realize today that the whole thing was about pretending something was real, when in truth it was not. \n \n \nPNAC << What are the indicators for such an event? How does one know when he is born again and when he is not?\n\n \n There are no indicators at all. At least, there are no physical signs of your salvation at the moment it actually happens. The moment you hear and believe the gospel, then you are given the Holy Spirit as a pledge of your heavenly inheritance (Eph. 1:13+14). That means you received a down payment. 'Christ in you' (Col. 1:27) was then born in the manger of your heart. This is the 'new creation' of Galatians 6:15, and the 'inner man' of 2Cor. 4:16. Now, if you choose to feed this new nature with the spiritual bread of God's Living Word, then that new spiritual nature inside shall begin to grow. Failure to feed the new nature will cause it to remain in a feeble condition your entire life. That is why some saved souls have the appearances of being unsaved.\n \n The new nature within is born with the eyes closed, and the inability to speak, just like an infant. The old fleshy man has been fed all your life and is very strong indeed. As the new nature within is fed, and grows in strength, then a battle begins to take place. The new nature is like David, and the old flesh nature is like Goliath. If you feed David within and starve Goliath, then victory over the flesh will become a reality in your life. THEN, you will look back on the day of your salvation and see (through the eyes of your new nature) that this was the day you received His Spirit. \n \n Christianity is not a religion at all, as if men can 'bind' themselves 'back' to God with works and rituals. True Christianity is a relationship (a faith) between you and the Father, through His Son, by the power of the Holy Spirit within you. See Romans 8:8-11 (the whole chapter is the jewel of the Pauline Epistles). \n \n Read from the Pauline Epistles every day, and the new man within will certainly continue to grow your entire life.\n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

Is being born again an addiction for some people......\n\n \n Love that dog in your avatar Joe, is that a spitz ? \n \n To the topic at hand, a born again has been renewed by the spirit of Christ, and their personality and character attributes will normally reflect it. The \"new\" or \"baby\" Christians, as some people will call them , have a energy in them just BURSTING, to tell the whole world about the Word , exasperated by the Spirit in them. They have this energy because, by truly believing in the word of Christ , and being in Spirit, they now have their eyes and hearts opened to knowledge they have never known, and they just want, and just HAVE to, pass it on.. And yes, they will come across as addictive personalities because as you mentioned, some will do backflips off the highboard and change their way of life totally. .. \n \n And, sometimes the newborns are a royal pain in the keester to others, emitting a personna of addictiveness to Christ. I think the outcome of being a newborn will lay heavy on the type personality the person had to begin with. In person , I have a quiet demeanor , with low self esteem and humility and will not start a conversation with anyone unless they start talking first . When I was blessed with the Fruits of the Spirit, I felt the newness of Christ's WORD , along with all the changes it made in my person, but did NOT feel a uncontrollable urge to shove my new found knowledge down other peoples throat...\n \n \n On the OTHER hand, at that time of my renewal, if a person questioned me as to the validity of my beliefs , words loaded with the knowledge of the word of Christ would just start pouring out of me, to answer their questions. And I still to this day , 25 years later, can NOT give creedence to the origin of that knowledge, except to the Spirit of Christ giving it to me at that time. But, the exhuberance does subside on the newborns, and they calm down after a while and set their life on a course of calmly spreading and living the Word, or they may even , as I did, become too weak to hold on to it , lose it, and end up just posting about it to people on a BBS, :)",

That is the same gospel message Christ preached in Matthew 4:17, (23) and Matt. 9:35. James teaches Kingdom Doctrine and justification by faith AND works in James 2:20-24. That applies to Kingdom Disciples under the Kingdom Administration. My original statements pertain to members of the 'body of Christ' in this 'dispensation of the grace of God' (Eph. 3:2). So your question pertains to Kingdom Doctrine, when I am describing precepts of Grace Doctrine. \n \n Again, this is the typical bait and switch (apples to oranges) tactic you bring to this forum. Has the Holy Spirit introduced the Apostle Paul by the time of Acts 8? No. Therefore, would it be possible for Christ to reveal our gospel to Paul (Gal. 1:11+12) by this time? No. Therefore, there is no way possible for Philip to be preaching what Paul calls 'my gospel' (Rom. 2:16, 16:25) in Acts 8. My original statements to PNAC on this thread concern themselves with people who are justified by faith apart from works (Rom. 4:4+5); those who receive imputed righteousness (Rom. 4:5) just like David (Rom. 4:6). Paul writes,\n \n \n\"For this reason {it is} by faith, in order that {it may be} in accordance with grace, so that the promise will be guaranteed to all the descendants . . .\" Rom. 4:16.\n\n \n The gospel of the kingdom and the gospel of the grace of God are NOT the same good news message. The first was preached long before the crucifixion, and continued to be preached long after. Paul's gospel (Christ Crucified) has its own set of precepts and is totally separate from the gospel of the kingdom. The reason that you are asking me questions from events in Acts 8 is because you do not yet see the difference. Go to my gospel post in the 'Biblical Contradictions' threads and give everyone a thoughtful reply.\n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

   "Is being born again an addiction?\n\n Yes, but not like you would think. When we are first introduced to the Holy Spirit our inner man becomes renewed, our mind becomes renewed, old things pass away and the newness of God is evident through the physical realm. This is sometimes considered addictive since those that have that renewal tend to lead a more productive life. Unfortunately some people want just that feeling. In that case they look for the emotional high instead of seeking God.\n \nIt occurs to me, that some people who become born again, make this choice because their life is already a mess.\n\n Already? Maybe so. Or the mess has driven them to find a fix. They have tried everything else and have finally made it to the only Thing that cures them.\n \nSome are in jail, some are drug addicts looking to get clean, some are alcoholics looking to be sober, some are promiscuous. Suddenly they are born again and their life is new again , but is this just another addiction? Whenever one chooses to stop these behaviors (drugs, sex or other) they are looking for something to fill this void. If you already have an addictive personality, why wouldn't you just become an addicted to \"salvation\". I wanted to see if others thought this is the case with some people. Can some people become addicted to \"salvation\"? They will start to take the bible so literally that is becomes an obsession?\n\n If you fake something long enough, you begin to live that fake until you are what you are faking. It happens a lot. I would say that if someone wanted to live a lie that this would be the best road&#8230;but it would soon become evident that this is one lie (or fake) that begins to require something more. God knows the hearts of men, bears them witness and then they are filled with the Holy Spirit.\n In Acts, chapter 19 the Bible says that there were disciples that never even heard of the Holy Spirit. These were baptized &#8220;into John&#8217;s (the Baptist) baptism&#8221;. But, once they heard the Gospel, they were baptized in the name of Jesus.\n So, getting into the fold is one thing, being part of it is another. Those who open a door for themselves can be part of a movement, but those who open the door for Christ become Christ-like. On the surface it would seem addictive, though.",
