   "I wonder how many Europeans agree with this. Comments? - especially from Europeans on this site? \n \n \n \n \n \nONE GERMAN WHO GETS IT\n \n Matthias Dapfner, Chief Executive of the huge German publisher Axel \n Springer AG, has written a blistering attack in DIE WELT, Germany's \n largest daily newspaper, against the timid reaction of Europe in the \n face of the Islamic threat.\n \n EUROPE - THY NAME IS COWARDICE (Commentary by Mathias Dapfner CEO, \n Axel Springer, AG)\n \n A few days ago Henry Broder wrote in Welt am Sonntag, \"Europe - your \n family name is appeasement.\" It's a phrase you can't get out of yourhead \n because it's so terribly true.\n \n Appeasement cost millions of Jews and non-Jews their lives as England \n and France, allies at the time, negotiated and hesitated too long before \n they noticed that Hitler had to be fought, not bound to toothless \n agreements.\n \n Appeasement legitimized and stabilized Communism in the Soviet Union, \n then East Germany, then all the rest of Eastern Europe where for \n decades, inhuman, suppressive, murderous governments were glorified as \n the ideologically correct alternative to all other possibilities.\n \n Appeasement crippled Europe when genocide ran rampant in Kosovo, and \n even though we had absolute proof of ongoing mass-murder, we Europeans \n debated and debated and debated, and were still debating when finally \n the Americans had to come from halfway around the world, into Europe yet \n again, and do our work for us.\n \n Rather than protecting democracy in the Middle East, European \n appeasement, camouflaged behind the fuzzy word \"equidistance,\" now \n countenances suicide bombings in Israel by fundamentalist Palestinians.\n \n Appeasement generates a mentality that allows Europe to ignore nearly\n 500,000 victims of Saddam's torture and murder machinery and, motivated \n by the self-righteousness of the peace-movement, has the gall to issue \n bad grades to George Bush... Even as it is uncovered that the loudest \n critics\n \n of the American action in Iraq made illicit billions, no, TENS of \n billions, in the corrupt U. N. Oil-for-Food program.\n \n And now we are faced with a particularly grotesque form of \n appeasement... How is Germany reacting to the escalating violence by \n Islamic fundamentalists in Holland and elsewhere? By suggesting that we \n really should have a \"Muslim Holiday\" in Germany.\n \n I wish I were joking, but I am not. A substantial fraction of our\n (German) Government, and if the polls are to be believed, the German \n people, actually believe that creating an Official State \"Muslim \n Holiday\" will somehow spare us from the wrath of the fanatical Islamists.\n \n One cannot help but recall Britain's Neville Chamberlain waving the \n laughable treaty signed by Adolf Hitler, and declaring European \"Peace \n in our time\".\n \n What else has to happen before the European public and its political \n leadership get it? There is a sort of crusade underway, an especially \n perfidious crusade consisting of systematic attacks by fanatic Muslims, \n focused on civilians, directed against our free, open Western societies, \n and intent upon Western Civilization's utter destruction.\n \n It is a conflict that will most likely last longer than any of the great \n military conflicts of the last century - a conflict conducted by an \n enemy that cannot be tamed by \"tolerance\" and \"accommodation\" but is \n actually spurred on by such gestures, which have proven to be, and will \n always be taken by the Islamists for signs of weakness.\n \n Only two recent American Presidents had the courage needed for \n anti-appeasement: Reagan and Bush.\n \n His American critics may quibble over the details, but we Europeans know \n the truth. We saw it first hand: Ronald Reagan ended the Cold War, \n freeing half of the German people from nearly 50 years of terror and \n virtual slavery. And Bush, supported only by the Social Democrat Blair, \n acting on moral conviction, recognized the danger in the Islamic War \n against democracy. His place in history will have to be evaluated after \n a number of years have passed.\n \n In the meantime, Europe sits back with charismatic self-confidence in \n the multicultural corner, instead of defending liberal society's values \n and being an attractive center of power on the same playing field as the \n true great powers, America and China.\n \n On the contrary - we Europeans present ourselves, in contrast to those \n \"arrogant Americans\", as the World Champions of \"tolerance\", which even\n (Germany's Interior Minister) Otto Schily justifiably criticizes. Why? \n Because we're so moral? I fear it's more because we're so materialistic, \n so devoid of a moral compass.\n \n For his policies, President Bush risks the fall of the dollar, huge \n amounts of additional national debt, and a massive and persistent burden \n on the American economy - because unlike almost all of Europe, Bush \n realizes what is at stake - literally everything.\n \n While we criticize the \"capitalistic robber barons\" of America because \n they seem too sure of their priorities, we timidly defend our Social \n Welfare systems. Stay out of it! It could get expensive! We'd rather \n discuss reducing our 35-hour workweek or our dental coverage, or our 4 \n weeks of paid vacation... Or listen to TV pastors preach about the need \n to \"reach out to terrorists. To understand and forgive\".\n \n These days, Europe reminds me of an old woman who, with shaking hands, \n frantically hides her last pieces of jewelry when she notices a robber \n breaking into a neighbor's house.\n \n Appeasement? Europe, thy name is Cowardice!!\n",

   "Personally, I would like to see greater European involvement in Iraq (it will be on our border once Turkey joins after all) to help clean up the mess the invasion made and hopefully pull something good out of it.\n \n I would also like a rethink of social and economic policy in Europe.\n \n I agree that Europe should have acted collectively in Kosovo, but the means/institutions to do so did not really exists. Now European forces have largely taken over operations in the region and the EU is forming European \"battlegroups\" in a further example of defence/security co-operation and the need for intervention.\n \n But that article is a hyperinflated scaremongering rant which somehow turns a few violent incidents into the largest war since the last century? Please, it sounds more like a social inclusion and public order issue.\n \n The Islamic holiday sounds like a good step to me, demagraphic trends are showing that Europe could be predominantly Islamic by 2100, it would be best if we got used to the idea and made the transition as easy as possible.\n \n The accusation regarding suicide bombings is utterly unjustified.\n \n The word \"appeasement\" is used a number of times with little factual basis in areas that are highly debatable, and the links to the pre WW2 situation are irrelevant. \n \n One could more legitimately argue that Britain and other co-alition countries appeased US aggression in Iraq.",

   "...The Islamic holiday sounds like a good step to me, demagraphic trends are showing that Europe could be predominantly Islamic by 2100, it would be best if we got used to the idea and made the transition as easy as possible...\nI'd largely agree with most of your post: the OP is a scaremongering rant short of factual content or support for the accusations made, but I disagree with this bit. Islam will likely dominate as the most practiced religion as the century progresses, but it will do so because Christianity is in decline. Europe is predominantly secular and is likely to become more so over the coming decades.\n \n I personally think it better that Europe seeks to further decouple its holidays from associations with any religion rather than creating more religious based holidays.",

   "RE: Article\n \n It was pretty crappy and full of questionable claims... Sorry, I don`t agree at all. Europe has become peace-egoistic. We don`t want to wage war. We rather use soft measures like diplomacy and economic aid in order to make the world a better place. Iraq was a mistake, Kosovo was a stupid attempt to snub russian interests, Israel are killing more palestinians than palestinians kill Israelis. The author is just the typical neo-conservative... And quite sad at that...\n \n RE: Muslim population\n \n I`m still very sceptic towards this whole idea that Europe will become pre-dominantly Muslim anytime soon. I`ve read it in papers (and on web-sites) as well, but none of them have been able to explain or show how they have calculated. Immigration figures as well as birth ratesdo not really support the notion that Europe will become pre-dominantly Muslim within any foreseable future... That being said, I think we should honour muslim holidays as well. Just like we should honour Christian and Jewish holidays (and perhaps even Hindu and Budhistic).",
