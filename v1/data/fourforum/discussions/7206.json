   "Apparently so. This has to do with new proposed accounting rules, which in my opinion, should have been in place all alone. Is the fat lady about to sing?\n ==================\n \n From today's WSJ, page C3.\n \n \"A review of General Motors Corporations 2005 would include billions of dollars in losses, tepid sales and high costs.\n \n A fresh year may bring fresh financial woes: If accounting rule makers proceed with a plan to compel companies to account for their pension plans on their balance, sheets, GM might suffer more than any other firm. Such a change may even wipe out most or all of the auto maker's shareholder equity, which is another way of saying that when all of GM's liabilities are subtracted from its' total assets, little or nothing my be left...\n \n (snip)\n \n As of the end of 2004, GM's equity was $27.7 billion, so this approach would have slashed the equity as of that point to $3.2 billion. As of GM's latest balance sheet, on September 30, equity had drooped even lower, to $22.4 billion, so it is possible that the new accounting might send GM's equity into the red...\n \n Snip)\n \n www.wsj.com",

   "That mentality has been around since unions chose to elect rank and file members as their leadership, foregoing outside, pragmatic board decisions. When US vehicle manufacturers held a captive US market, no problem, give them what they want and pass it on to the consumer. Even better, we won't book the long-term liability and our balance sheets will look great to Wall Street. I have no sympathy for union or management current dilemmas. Unions got what they wanted (better pay/benefits for semi-skills than the average college graduate), white collar workers followed the gravy train, management participated in substantial bonus pools and the hidden liabilities kept growing until retirement from the peak years became a regular, substantial income statement hit. That's now 'the good old days', forever gone. \n \n GM has a hoard of cash and irrevocable credit; what better time to bite the bullet, accept the strike and get labor/benefit operating costs where they should be in today's marketplace? Move the factories to Alabama, etc. or let them stay in metropolitan areas at what foreign manufacturers pay. I see it as a choice of downsizing now or accumulating not only additional union liabilities, but accompanying white collar future liabilities and paying the same price in prolonged operating losses with the same loss of market share. Let the blood flow now and establish realistic future goals instead of being taken down a bite at a time. No management is capable of realistic planning with the uncertainties GM faces. You can view all the financial models planners spit out, but without a positive, defined direction all they are is models requiring timely consideration until stockholders eventually paper their walls with worthless stock certificates after the BK. \n \n For GM's sake, Delphi will hopefully force the issue, but I noticed they've raised their wage offer beyond current market price.",

The product areas include in-vehicle entertainment systems, powertrain products, safety systems and temperature controls, Delphi President Rodney O'Neal said in the statement. \n \n The company will stop making brakes, chassis, catalysts, cockpits, door modules, instrument panels, wheel bearings and steering systems. It plans to sell off all but eight of its 29 remaining U.S. production sites by Jan. 1, 2008. \n\n \n This is not just a bankruptcy and a labor tiff, Delphi is using this as an opportunity to take their business a whole new direction.\n \n I agree with your above post, George, It is time for GM to take a stand, take the hit that would come with the strike, use it as an opportunity to file themselves and re-org, and have their own labor contracts canceled and dump some of their pension and most of their health care liabilities. \n \n I cannot imagine that there will come a time in the future that would be better for them to take the hit, especially if Delphi is going to stop producing many of GMs parts. GM is not going to find another provider that will consistently sell them parts at a loss. If labor costs have not already pushed them into bankruptcy by 2008, the supply chain disruption almost certainly will. \n \n If they allow Delphi to take the opening shots and fight the UAW contract now, it should be a walk in the park for GM to get theirs circle filed. GM not weighted down by their rediculous labor contract could be a competitve company. Besides the ability to replace their $75 an hour labor with $12.50 an hour labor, they could move ahead with some technology upgrades (robotics) that currently are not cost effective becuse under the current arrangement they are still required to pay the workers that the machines replace.\n \n George, this is more your realm than mine.
