   "This both angers and saddens me.\n \n First of all, I desperately want the Conservatives to win the election, Stephen Harper's announcement that he will revisit the same sex marriage issue if elected, on the first day of his campaign, has likely caused any chance the Conservative had of forming a gov't, even a minority gov't, to go up in smoke. How can Harper be so stupid, I wanted to punch some sense into him this morning when I heard his comments on the news. It's out there now, and he will not be trusted on the issue again, regardless of how his stance is modified.\n \n Secondly, I think having an election where this issue is at the forefront, given all the issues facing Canadians right now, is INEXCUSABLE. It could not be less important IMHO, and yet, it will likely end up being a key factor in the voting, allowing the crooked Liberals back into power, or even worse, increasing the power of the NDP.\n \n I'm all for gay marriage, I think that's clear based on my posting record here, I think it's a basic human right. I'd hate to see that taken away after Canada took steps to make it law. That said, this is not an issue that affects the vast majority of Canadians in a significant enough manner to be a focal point in a federal election.\n \n Thought I'd throw this out for fellow Canadians, and interested Americans, to comment on.\n \n Waxy",

The problem lies in getting conservative votes in notoriously Liberal and NDP Ontario and Quebec, where elections are essentially decided due to their much larger population bases. The same sex marriage issue has STRONG support in these regions, and IMHO, Harper campaigning on the issue toasted any support he might have garnered in the area based on the Liberal boondoggle. \n \n I'm sure it appeals to the far right leaning Conservatives, the Jyoshus of Canada are probably doing cartwheels, unfortunately (or fortunately) there aren't enoug Jyoshus in Canada to even come close to getting anyone elected, let alone even be the official opposition party.\n \n IMHO, for a majority of Canadians it's a not a primary issue, but for many, it's something they feel strongly about, it will become a hot button issue, and it will likely influence their vote. That hard line stance will be used to paint the Conservatives as cold, calculating, religious fundamentalist, capitalists (ie US style Republicans lol) not to be trusted with Canada's social issues, and that DOES NOT fly in eastern Canada. \n \n Even myself, a fiscal conservative desperate to get rid of the Liberals, would have to pause before voting for the Conservatives, knowing that they would dredge up the issue and attempt to erase what I feel are just laws.\n \n It's the height of stupidity on the part of Harper IMHO, and I bet dollars to donuts that my sentiments are shared by many, if not most, within the Conservative party.\n \n Waxy",

There was no insidious homosexual conspiracy to take over Canada and destroy our society, traditional families didn't disappear, heterosexual couples were still being married in their churches, gays weren't running rampant in the street trying to molest everyone they encountered - in short, and this may come as a shock to you, the world as we know it didn't come to an end!\n \n If you asked 100 people on the street how their lives had changed since same sex marriage laws were passed, unless you happened to interview a homosexual that just got married, the answer would inevitably be \"it hasn't\". \n \n I'm sure there are a few Canadians out there that are not happy with the legislation, but the majority are either not interested, or simply view the issue as something that doesn't really affect them and they just show tolerance.

   "I agree with everything you've said regarding Harper, that was definitely not a smart move. It's going to haunt him- look at what happened with the abortion issue. Another factor is that he wanted to send Canadians to Iraq. IMO, many voters see him as too \"american\". \n \n I agree that it's time for a change. Perhaps if the conservatives had a different leader they could shed the party's negative image. I noticed that MP's Randy White and Gurmant Grewal are not running, which should help.\n \n The Conservatives are going to get my vote anyway, because although I strongly support same sex marriage, I don't think they can actually reverse it.

I'm in favour of some increasesed military spending, mostly just to get us into the 21st century, but I don't want us involved in Iraq. IMHO, that's how most Canadians feel, Harper is right for the most part on the issue, but just goes one step too far, as usual.\n \n The truth is, there's not much the Conservatives are campaigning on other than economic issues that have my full support.

There is also private money invested, obviously, as there are just as many commercials airing as on any other network.

Popular CBC political satire shows such as the Royal Canadian Air Farce, and This Hour Has 22 Minutes are quite harsh in their criticism of politicans of all political leanings. Rex Murphy's \"Point of View\", commentary, at the end of many CBC national nightly newscasts, speaks out against Liberal government policies on many occaisions.
