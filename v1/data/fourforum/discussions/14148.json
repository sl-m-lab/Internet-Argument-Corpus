   "If bones could scream, a bloodcurdling din would be reverberating through a 500-year-old cemetery in Peru. Human skeletons unearthed there have yielded the first direct evidence of Inca fatalities caused by Spanish conquerors.\n \n European newcomers killed some Inca individuals with guns, steel lances or hammers, and possibly light cannons, scientists report online in the March 23 American Journal of Physical Anthropology.\n \n Surprisingly, though, no incisions or other marks characteristic of sword injuries appear on these bones, according to a team led by archaeologist Guillermo XXXX of the Consult on Cultural Heritage in Lima and including anthropologist Melissa Murphy of the University of Wyoming in Laramie. Spanish documents from the 16th century emphasize steel swords as a favored military weapon.\n\n Inca Cemetery Holds Brutal Glimpses Of Spanish Violence - Science News\n \n Gun violence in the New World.\n \n The good old European guns to git gold and kill! kill! kill!",
