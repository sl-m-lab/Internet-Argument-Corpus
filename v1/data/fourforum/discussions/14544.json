   "Arrested OBN agent was tracked by authorities for several days | NewsOK.com\n \n \nAn Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Control agent charged with trafficking firearms to Mexico was followed by authorities for several days, apparently unaware he was under surveillance.\n \n Francisco Javier Reyes, 29, was arraigned Tuesday in federal court after his arrest by Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents. He is charged in connection with a gunrunning scheme that led to the trafficking of firearms to Mexico, according to court records.\n \n Federal authorities allege Reyes, of Oklahoma City, recruited two friends to buy guns for him. The guns later were taken south toward Mexico, where authorities think they were to be delivered.\n \n Reyes resigned from the bureau and was ordered freed on personal recognizance bond.\n \n On June 9, ATF agents followed Reyes from Oklahoma City to Woodward, where he stopped at Butch's Gun Shop, 5005 W Oklahoma Ave., a court affidavit states. He came out with two men and a .50-caliber gun case, which ATF agents had equipped with a tracking device, the affidavit states. The men put the case in Reyes' sport utility vehicle, and agents followed him to Oklahoma City and to Purcell.\n \n Gun case tracked\n Reyes pulled into a parking lot with a black BMW M3 convertible along Interstate 35 in Purcell, then Reyes headed north and the BMW left headed south, according to the affidavit. The tracking device then showed the gun case was in the BMW. It later exited the freeway and when it got back on, it appeared to be \"driving in tandem\" with a tan Range Rover. Authorities later determined the case was in the Range Rover, which later parked at a Lewisville, Texas, residence with the BMW, the affidavit states.\n \n Officials eventually tracked the .50-caliber gun case to a Dallas apartment complex which was then put on 24-hour surveillance, the affidavit states. Agents followed the gun's movements for about a week and eventually worked with Texas troopers to pull over a Ford Explorer and a Saturn car for traffic violations near the Mexican border, the affidavit states.\n \n The Explorer had the .50-caliber rifle inside with its serial number scratched off and 12 assault rifles. The Saturn had one pistol and 30 assault rifles inside, and agents said many of the guns had obliterated serial numbers, the affidavit states.\n \n On May 20, agents also seized a 7.62 mm rifle they think was headed for Mexico and had been originally bought by Reyes, according to the affidavit. Reyes told agents he had traded the gun to someone else for a .22-caliber rifle.\n \n Agents watched Reyes buy two rifles from a man on whom the ATF had placed surveillance equipment on July 22 at the Bass Pro Shops parking lot in Oklahoma City, the affidavit states. The ATF followed Reyes for three days and eventually followed him to the same Lewisville, Texas, residence where the Range Rover and BMW had parked.\n \n Speeding complaint\n Reyes was stopped on July 25 in Denton County on a speeding complaint, and a sheriff's deputy found a bag of suspected marijuana, checks for $27,700 and $6,000 inside an unlocked briefcase and sheets of notebook paper with currency amounts, gun models and manufacturers, the affidavit states.\n \n Referring to the drugs, Reyes told deputies he was bringing \"some of his work home\" with him and said he and a partner traded firearms, the affidavit states. It is unclear if Reyes was arrested in the stop.\n \n Jorge Alexis Blanco, who is named in the affidavit as one of the men Reyes recruited to buy guns for him, bought at least 15 guns and attempted to buy three more, ATF Special Agent Michael Randall wrote in the affidavit.\n \n Blanco told investigators he had known Reyes for about six years and that he was planning on opening a business with him, Kiko's Hookah Lounge, in Stillwater.\n \n Federal firearms dealer records show Blanco bought five Century AK-47 rifles April 14 from Outdoor America, 1925 N MacArthur Blvd., and five more from the same store April 27.\n \n The next day, Blanco bought five Chinese-made SKS 7.62 mm semiautomatic rifles from Big Boy's Guns and Ammo, 7211 S Council Road, with a \"wad\" of $100 bills, store owner Mike Blackwell told agents. Blanco told him he was buying the guns for family members.\n \n Claim reversed\n Blanco returned to the store with his girlfriend two days later and tried to buy three more of the rifles, the affidavit states. When Blackwell told him the purchase process for those rifles was \"delayed,\" his girlfriend attempted to buy them. Blackwell said Blanco needed to purchase the rifles because he picked them out, so Blanco gave him his driver's license but the process was still delayed.\n \n Blanco told agents May 1 he spent about $6,000 to $7,000 provided by Reyes to buy the guns, and Reyes paid him $750 for his efforts, according to the affidavit. The next day, he told agents he had lied to them and he bought them for friends as gifts. Blanco, who had previously told the agents he was a \"poor college kid,\" said he had the money to buy the guns left over from student financial aid, the affidavit states.\n \n Kyle Wooten was another man investigators think bought guns on Reyes' behalf, the affidavit states. He bought 14 assault rifles, 10 of them AK-47s, from Outdoor America in purchases April 13 and April 20, paying almost $6,500 in cash. He also bought a Bushmaster BA50.50-caliber rifle from H&H Gun Range, 400 S Vermont St., with ammunition for $5,467.48 in cash.\n \n Man was found dead\n According to the affidavit, Wooten was found dead by his girlfriend April 22 on the bathroom floor of their apartment, the morning after Wooten went to Oklahoma City to buy guns on Reyes' behalf. The affidavit states an autopsy was not performed because of \"a pending toxicology report.\"\n \n Reyes' public defender, Paul Lacy, asked to withdraw as his attorney Wednesday, citing a conflict of interest because he is representing a defendant in a case in which Reyes is a government witness, court records show. A U.S. magistrate appointed Robert Wyatt as Reyes' new attorney.\n\n \n So we've got a federal law enforcement agent, the people who are charged with actually upholding the laws and keeping us safe from crime, actually going out of his way to break the law and supply guns to drug cartel members.\n \n Exactly how would stricter gun laws prevent something like this from happening? Explain.",

   "Gun trafficking organization leader sentenced to 3 years in prison after supplying weapons to Mexican cartel WireUpdate Local | Local Breaking News | Local Breaking Wire -\n \n \nUCSON, ARIZONA (BNO NEWS) - The leader of a firearms trafficking organization in the United States was sentenced on Monday to 46 months in prison for supplying weapons to the Sinaloa Cartel in Mexico, prosecutors said.\n \n Alejandro Medrano, 23, of Mesa, Arizona was convicted for his leadership role in the conspiracy involving 10 defendants who \"straw purchased\" firearms from gun dealers in Phoenix and Tucson for the purpose of supplying the firearms to a member of the Sinaloan drug cartel known as \"Rambo.\"\n \n Another leader of the same organization was sentenced last July. Hernan Ramos, 22, of Mesa, was sentenced to 50 months of imprisonment while most of the remaining defendants in the conspiracy received prison terms ranging from 14 to 30 months.\n \n From February 2008 through November 2008, the ten defendants falsely claimed they were the actual purchasers of 112 firearms from federally licensed firearms dealers in the Phoenix and Tucson area and transported them into Mexico to sell to a member of the Sinaloan drug cartel, Ruben Javier Elenes Ruiz, also known as \"Rambo.\"\n \n \"We are working aggressively with the ATF and other federal agencies to stop this southbound flow of arms that are spilling blood in Mexico's drug war,\" said U.S. Attorney Dennis Burke.\n \n In addition to the indictment, an ATF investigation revealed that the defendants purchased 117 firearms. The firearms were predominately assault-style rifles, including a .50 caliber rifle, and handguns known to be weapons of choice by the Mexican drug cartels.\n \n Fifteen of the firearms have been recovered in Mexico. Nine of the firearms were recovered together in Navojoa, northern Mexico on February 24, 2010, in a seizure totaling seventy-three firearms and 70,000 rounds of ammunition.\n \n \"This investigation is also further proof that the 'straw purchase' of firearms continues to be a significant problem. Those individuals that knowingly falsify ATF firearms forms to supply Mexican drug cartels with firearms have as much blood on their hands as the criminals that use them,\" said Bill Newell, Special Agent in Charge of the ATF Phoenix Division.\n\n \n So we've got a man who's been convicted of firearms trafficking and gun running, and what kind of sentence does he get? 46 months. That's not even four years in prison.\n \n Federal law dictates ten years in prison for each weapon trafficked. With all of the guns this guy sold to Mexico he should rightfully be in prison for the rest of his natural life and beyond. He should never see the light of day again. But instead he's going to be free by 2014, able to do this again.\n \n How exactly would stricter gun laws prevent something like this from happening? What good would come of it if the minimum sentence won't even be delivered?",

   "The answer to this is, and always has been, drugs, and money drugs provides! It has corrupted the Mexican government, military and the very police that are supposed to eradicate this problem. It has corrupted American border and customs agents too. Various police from cities all over this country, are not immune either.",
