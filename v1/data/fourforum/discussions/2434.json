   "To SilentPoet:\n I might as well give it ago, I am just a tad bored, you know what I mean?\n \n What is God as best defined by you? Describe the nature of God. What is it that you believe in? \n \n Before I start, I am a Christian and will as a result be trying to answer your question from a Biblical point-of-view. \n \n An introduction to the Trinty:\n There is only one God; but He consists of three distinct persons, Father, Son and the Holy Spirit. The word \"Trinty\" is not found anywhere in the Scriptures, but it is name given by Christians to express the doctrine of the unity of God as consisting of three distinct persons. So your question becomes sort of illogical. For more information on the Trinty and the Christian doctrine regarding it, I would strongly suggest and recommend that you visit the Bible Dictionary for \"Trinty\" on the Christian Answers website. \n \n Because this part isn't really my strongsuit - I believe it but I have trouble explaining this, I have copied this information from the Christian Answers website:\n TRI-UNITY -- The teaching of the Bible concerning the Trinity might be summarized thus. God is a Tri-unity, with each Person of the Godhead equally and fully and eternally God. Each is necessary, and each is distinct, and yet all are one. The three Persons appear in a logical, causal order. The Father is the unseen, omnipresent Source of all being, revealed in and by the Son, experienced in and by the Holy Spirit. The Son proceeds from the Father, and the Spirit from the Son. With reference to God's creation, the Father is the Thought behind it, the Son is the Word calling it forth, and the Spirit is the Deed making it a reality.\n \n We \"see\" God and His great salvation in the Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, then \"experience\" their reality by faith, through the indwelling presence of His Holy Spirit.\n \n Though these relationships seem paradoxical, and to some completely impossible, they are profoundly realistic, and their truth is ingrained deep in man's nature. Thus, men have always sensed first the truth that God must be \"out there,\" everywhere present and the First Cause of all things, but they have corrupted this intuitive knowledge of the Father into pantheism and ultimately into naturalism.\n \n Similarly, men have always felt the need to \"see\" God in terms of their own experience and understanding, but this knowledge that God must reveal Himself has been distorted into polytheism and idolatry. Men have thus continually erected \"models\" of God, sometimes in the form of graven images, sometimes even in the form of philosophical systems purporting to represent ultimate reality.\n \n Finally, men have always known that they should be able to have communion with their Creator and to experience His presence \"within.\" But this deep intuition of the Holy Spirit has been corrupted into various forms of false mysticism and fanaticism, and even into spiritism and demonism. Thus, the truth of God's tri-unity is ingrained in man's very nature, but he has often distorted it and substituted a false god in its place.\n \n The above is basically the Christian belief summed up. Simple and effective. That appears to answer your questions, curtsey Christian Answers",

God is difficult to define. One would not expect a finite being such as myself to define clearly and completely an infinite being such as God. \n \n However, as with any person God has defined himself. We all definie or identify, ourselves by various methods. What we like and dislike. What we do, where we go, where we have been. God has done this as well in the bible. He has mades statements about the things he likes and dislikes (The ten commandments for instance). He tells what he does (he is a creator for instance, He loves, he has mercy and grace.) He tells us where he has been (He is the God that is, was, and will be, in otherwords exists outside of time).\n \n There are other things naturally. I can tell you some because as a finite being I will take a life time getting to know him. This is true with any person. You cannot completely define your closest and dearest friend. It is impossible because people are infinitely complex. You can know your friend none the less. This is true of God as well. You have heard me talk about God on this forum for quite sometime. This is how God is defined. You ask an impossibly broad question. Sglaine seems to imply that theists will only hamper you with illogic when it comes to defining God and they will eventually say they don't know. I know some not all. So do you. This is right.

Finally a definition I can work with to understand.\n \n All right we have come up with \"extremely powerful\" \"credited to creating the universe and life\" \"nurturing\" and \"benevolent\".\n \n First I need to clear up \"extremely powerful\". \n Are you excluding God from being omnipotent (all powerful)?\n In other words, is God all powerful, or extremely powerful?\n \n Next I'd like to present a belief of mine in relation to \"credited to creating the universe and life\":\n \n I have very few concrete beliefs. But one of this is an axiom. This axiom is that \"existance exists\". I do not find existance to be a perceptual thing, but rather existance exists outside of perception.\n \n Life, the universe, existance itself is independent. It does not rely on the perceptions of others to exist, rather it exists.\n \n As part of this axiom existance (as a whole) cannot be simply created. Nor can existance (as a whole) be destroyed. Existance is and always will be in form of another of: Matter, Space, Energy, Light, Heat, etc...\n \n That is my axiom. Which although it may not seem relevant now I am certain it will eventually come up if the conversation continues and we can refer back to this.\n \n Now you have said that God is \"extremely powerful\" (powerful enough apparently make existance out of non-existance) and that he created the universe and life in which we know live. Also you have stated that God is benevolent. \n \n And so down the rabbit hole we go...\n \n Every action, every deed and every occurance of anything in the unvirse is allowed by God to occur. \n \n If God is extremely powerful and all good how does this fit in with the travestys that befall mankind. War, Death, Rape, Thievery, etc.... \n In respect to the idea of good and evil (which we have come to understand) this universe, this life, is surely full of evil.\n \n When asking this question before I have received the answer that evil and bad befall man because of the \"origonal sin\" Adam and Eve made. While I don't think this argument holds up when you bring in some claims of God's omniscience I will leave this alone.\n But while this claim might be able to defend the allowance by God of man affecting man it does not cover up for God's allowance of the natural travestys and disasters that befall man, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, etc...\n \n So if God is truly benevolent why does he allow such natural disasters which kill and wreck lives to occur? If God was not all good would he surely not stop these incidents from occuring?",

I hope you are well.\n\n \n And the same to you.\n \n \nOne would not expect a finite being such as myself to define clearly and completely an infinite being such as God. \n \n \n Understood that you could claim that you cannot COMPLETELY define God.\n \n \nHe has mades statements about the things he likes and dislikes (The ten commandments for instance). He tells what he does (he is a creator for instance, He loves, he has mercy and grace.) He tells us where he has been (He is the God that is, was, and will be, in otherwords exists outside of time).\n\n \n But none of this tells me what God is.\n \n \nThis is how God is defined. You ask an impossibly broad question. Sglaine seems to imply that theists will only hamper you with illogic when it comes to defining God and they will eventually say they don't know. I know some not all. So do you. This is right. To assume that we should be able to define God completely and accurately is illogical\n\n \n But surely there is a more specific definition you can give than incomprhensible / undefinable. Otherwise I'm not entirely sure you what you believe in as the discussion would follow:\n \n T:I believe in God\n A:What is God?\n T:I dont know.\n A:Well then what is it that you believe in?\n \n The theist (under the undefinable definition of God) is forced to answer:\n T: I dont know \n \n And so I would ask you now:\n \"Well then in what sense is your statement even relevant?\n How does your beleif any different from no beleif at all\"\n \n \nThis is true with any person. You cannot completely define your closest and dearest friend. It is impossible because people are infinitely complex. \n \n \n Yes but I can assign attributes to my friend, while not having to full define him.\n \n I am not asking for a full definition of God, because that would seem impossible if he is truly undefinable would it not?\n \n Instead I am asking for attributes to describe in some way the nature of God to me.\n (This can also be done in relationship to my closest friend, while not having to full define him.)",

   "SilentPoet,\n \n No; \"being\" is used in many senses and ranges quite significantly depending on its context. There cannot be a better definition for God than Supreme Being. And, as you have probably noticed, it is certainly a common one. From the modifying qualifier, \"Supreme\" we can actually speculate on the majority of the properties of such a being. To put it simply, it means unrivalled and best. With regard to existence, such a being is that which exists necessarily; and, this tells us several things, once again. For example, that all that exists is contingent upon its existence; it can never be destroyed, etc...\n \n To your original question: \"What is God?\" People have various ideas of what \"God\" is, and they vary quite significantly. Some think there are a plethora of gods, some think there to be only one. I assume you are referring to the God of Classical Theism, however. Such a being has various attributes, and, I'm sure you know of them. So, just what is the point of this thread? See the Catholic's take on God.

The supernatural is completely independent of any established laws of the universe and existance. It lies beyond the realm of human comprehension. \n I assume we can agree on this.\n \n A perfect supernatural God?\n \n What true relevancy does the quality of perfection hold on the supernatural. Since the supernatural lies beyond human understand and we can have no comprehension of the supernatural the perfect or imperfect supernatural would hold no bearing as we as people could not differentiate between the two.\n How would one know claim that something beyond our realm of understanding (in the supernatural realm) is perfect. \n Perfect can only been used when described in relationship to something else and since God in the supernatural realm cannot be validly compared in the area of perfection to people, God as the only supernatural idea would neither be perfect nor imperfect.\n \n \n An Omnipotent God?\n \n Omnipotent (all powerful). What is meant by this? Is God truly capable of doing anything, even if it defys logical possibility.\n \n For instance can God creat a square circle? No of course not because this is impossible. The assertion that God can do such is absurd.\n \n And so the theist must resort to the idea that God can do anything that we can imagine. \"If we can think it, God can do it\".\n I cannot imagine a square circle, but I can imagine an acorn changing into an elephant. And while this may appear valid because at first glance it seems to eliminate the \"logically impossible\" it does no such thing.\n \n The mere fact that I can imagine an acorn into an elephant does not make it a possibility. It is impossible for such a thing.\n \n Everything in existance has qualities that make it what it is. All of these things simply do not pop out of nowhere but are rather formed by combinations of matter (or energy). One form of matter cannot simply change itself to another form of matter without the required elements and process motivation to do so, and these elements required cannot simply pop out of nowhere.\n \n The specifications for an acorn vary greatly in that from an elephant. The acron can by no means change in any way into an elephant. An inanimate object cannot become a concious one. \n Its logically impossible.\n \n Both the \"square circle\" and \"acorn to elephant\" are logically impossibilities and to claim them as possible is absurd and irrational.\n \n Now the theist has several choices. \n 1. He can continue to claim that God is omnipotent while ignoring all logical evidence to the contrary. \n 2. He can abandon his claim of God being omnipotent and change the quality of God to extremely powerful.\n 3. Or he can flee into a form of agnosticism where he claims that God's awsome power is beyond human understand and logic nor reason are able to step into the realm which is God.\n \n The 1st choice is irrational.\n The 2nd is somewhat more logical\n The 3rd falls to:\n If man is unable to comprehend God how is it that you can claim that this God is omnipotent, if it was truly unable to be comprehended wouldn't you simply not be sure?\n \n The Omniscince of God\n \n All right. But this come under disection of my previous argument adressed to another that I now give to you:\n \n If God is extremely powerful and all good how does this fit in with the travestys that befall mankind.

Firstly and foremost, your question is not only logically flawed, but also physically flawed. You asked for a description of God, but there are three parts to God - which you would know if you actually bothered to read it throughly with an \"open mind\". So in order to describe God we must define the three parts that make up God, i.e. the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit.\n \n Also, how can I explain something that I have no physically observed? Here your question is also logically flawed. I cannot explain the features to something to which I have no positively observed.\n \n But I didn't ask for the Trinity. I asked for God which you have told me = the trinity which = God. If I ask the nature of A, (and i do not know the nature of B) and you tell me A=B and B=A I have learned nothing except the relationship of A and B which I know nothing of. \n \n You asked me to describe God, and in order to do so, I need to describe or explain the concept of the Trinity. That is, there are three parts to \"God\" - as weird as that sounds. You were not specific in your question. You asked me to describe God, and God consists of three parts. As you can see, your question is flawed.\n \n I am asking the nature / description of what / who the father (God) is. \n \n How do you expect me to describe something that I have not seen. Your question is stupid and illogical. If you ask a half decent answerable question, you may get some answers. Basically, God is the \"Alpha and the Omega\".",

   "SP, your post 24 sums up nicely myperspective on the logic of the definition of God. i believe it was dremweaver that i had a long discussion with about this in another thread.\n \n there are many popular beliefs about the nature of God that believers take for granted but which are really illogical if you really look deeper at it. some of the common attributes of God that werent covered in post 24\n \n God knows the future and we have free will\n i wont go into this, but it is clearly illogical that both cannot coexist\n \n the question of evil in the world\n first of all, in all honesty, the existence of evil/natural disasters does not strengthen the notion that God doesnt exist, nor does it suggest that God is not a perfectly loving God. first of all, is a tsunami or earthquake or flood evil? if these \"disasters\" occured on Mars or any other unihabited planet, would it be evil? secondly, how do you define a tragedy? is a broken fingernail a tragedy? loss of your job? loss of a limb? loss of your life? tragedies are only defined in the perspective of the person experiencing the event. an event in itself cannot be evil or good, only the perception of the one experiencing it. a winter at one point could have been a natural disaster. a hot summer as well. even a sunset could cause destruction.\n \n think about a world where we stop all evil. food is abundant, nobody has to work and nobody feels pain. would that cause people to be more content? or innovative? or competitive? would mankind be as advanced as it is now?\n \n the question of testimony\n almost every believer subscribes to some written or passed-on story of past feats of God and historical manifestations of supernatural power being witnessed. but the biggest objection to the existence of God (personally, in my opinion) is the lack of present manifestation. the Bible and other religious books are filled with wonderous stories of miracles and supernatural events. then they would go on to claim that believers would able to achieve these same powers, or at least witness them. however, not a single miracle or supernatural event have been ever witnessed or recorded. i think this weighs even more heavily than the fact that no evidence of past reported miracles have ever been found. for example, if scientist produce confirmed reports that there are no chariots or remains of egyptian armies anywhere in the red sea, and then a man stands at the bank of th red sea and stretches out a stick and makes the water divide all the way down to the sea bed, then any evidence contrary to the story of Moses would be totally irrelevant. the same with many other stories of miracles. if a man could walk across the surface of liquid water, without the water changing and without the man's physiology changing, then there would be no dispute to whether Jesus could do it, or far less if Jesus even existed. but it is abundantly clear that these events are simply not happening in the world at all in this era, and it strongly suggests that they never did",

   "SilentPoet,\n \n God is the Supreme Being, and the Supreme Being is God, but it does not follow that we have not learnt anything. I'm mentioning this for the third time here, but hopefully it should be alright. This qualifier we have, \"Supreme\", tells us a lot of things. We can speculate on the attributes of such a being, Supreme Power; Supreme Knowledge and the like. Now, with regard to modal status, it should be palpable that a Supreme Being would have necessary existence - ontological perfection which, is indeed, the supreme modality; no other existence has more views. \n \n I don't normally provide links to argue my points, but here, it seemed as though you were genuinely trying to find out what theists mean when they posit such an entity as God. I apologise if I misread you, but if you were seeking to truly learn, that link would have been next to ideal for you. It sums up the Catholic doctrine on God. So wait, do you want me to go through these arguments now? Sheesh.\nSupernatural is by implication and definition outside of the physical realm and outside of natural laws. The supernatural is completely independent of any established laws of the universe and exist[e]nce. It lies beyond the realm of human comprehension.\nI'd like you to expand a little on the \"laws of nature\" here before we continue. In science, we use the term \"law\" a lot, but there really are no absolute laws of science. As you know, science is based on empiricism - on induction. It has no room for absolute truths and it would be a mockery to it to suggest that it does. We give names such as \"Newton's Laws\", \"Ohm's Law\", \"Kirchoff's Laws\" and the like, but none of these are absolute in any sense. Firstly, that which is reached through induction can never provide absolute certainty; it can only show something to be probable. \n \n However, that is not only what we rely on. In fact, we do indeed know that all these are subject to be broken. You'll note that at the point of a singularity all our \"laws\" break down - including Relativity and it all; our equations break up and everything is meaningless. Can't really blame us - how are we meant to comprehend that which is infinitesimal? So, what is meant when you say the \"laws\" of nature? Scientific laws (which aren't absolute)...? \n A perfect supernatural God?\nSorry, but the majority of that point is pure speculation. Granted for the moment that God in \"His realm\" is not \"perfect\" (something which the theist is not constrained to accept), as you presuppose, so what? Why would this cause a problem for the theist? The theist might easily superimpose that God, in comparison to homosapiens and all of nature is eternally perfect. Of course you can compare that which is another dimension; your point is saying that we cannot compare football and computer games - because one is a sport and the other is of something different - a computer. Or, that we could not compare two films because they are of a different genre. \n Omnipotence of God\nYou're asking this and you're telling me that you read the Catholic article? I won't outline it all now, partly because of lack of time, but: is the point of this thread for you to learn, or to debate? You might say both, but which is primary? If it is to learn, then I think you would do well to read the article on Omnipotence; if not, you can just say and I'll answer the questions you proffered. The only reason I provide links is because the arguments proposed here are pseudoproblems, answered easily by some mild theology. Particularly the POE.\n \n Problem of Evil\n \n I wrote the below some time ago on this forum; I think my views are pretty much the same, so it should suffice:\n \n Since you have presupposed in your inference three that evil exists, the burden of proof lays on your shoulder to (i) Define evil, and (ii) show that it exists.\n \n Since I have a little extra time, I think I'll go on with this. Your terms need to be thoroughly defined. I define God as Supreme Being. I think that God is Love, and I define love as that which facilitates goodness (not original to me). I also define omnipotence as \"Supreme Power\". Darkness is the absence of light - a lie is the obstruction of truth, evil is goodness denied. Evil, in itself, is not really a substance. It is but a deprivation. When an apple rots, the rottenness itself is not a substance, but simply the privation of freshness. Furthermore, \"coldness\" does not exist; it is but the absence of heat/energy. When we call a person \"cold\" we mean that they are one who is lacking in emotion or in sensitivity. In the same way, evil is goodness denied.\n \n On another note, let's proffer that it makes sense to say that evil exists. If a Supreme Being allowed this evil to occur, but for it to have a purpose, then things are \"all gravy\" and there's really no problem. On another note, if this God provided humans with free will moral agency, then it would not mean that he is malicious. What I mean, is that free moral agency is neither good nor evil. It is a mechanism, not an aesthetic, by which love and goodness can occur. Of course, it allows the contrapositive to occur since it is necessary - decision. One does not call a line crooked without some idea of a straight line. It can be easily argued that evil exists for us to consciously identify it from good. Paul writes, \"For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.\" \n \n Finally, the POE can never be used to refute the existence of an almighty being. It only poses as \"problem\" (if you want to call it that) to those who follow the God of Classical Theism. Therefore, it does not prove the non-existence of a God. On a last note, you suggest that this world is evil; tell me, which world are you comparing it to? \n \n You, in particular, speak of \"natural evil\" - tell me, why should I consider any of this evil. Are you proposing that an objective evil exists? Perhaps a definition (preferably not an example) of evil would suffice, here. On a final note; Poet- if you were provided with the evidence, would you change your stance on the existence of God, truly?",

   "Epaphras_faith,\n \n But surely there is a more specific definition you can give than incomprhensible / undefinable.

GOd spoke in the person of Jesus. Jesus was the exact representation of God. It is one of His purposes for coming. God's love is displayed by the fact that while we were still enemies He died for me on the cross.

   "To all,\n \n I apologize for my late response. I have been out of town.\n \n Dreamweaver,\n \n \nGod is the Supreme Being, and the Supreme Being is God, but it does not follow that we have not learnt anything. I'm mentioning this for the third time here, but hopefully it should be alright.\n\n \n Unless I have a clear notion (which I don't) of what a Supreme Being is, then I know nothing of God and nothing is learned.\n \n \nThis qualifier we have, \"Supreme\", tells us a lot of things. We can speculate on the attributes of such a being, Supreme Power; Supreme Knowledge and the like. Now, with regard to modal status, it should be palpable that a Supreme Being would have necessary existence - ontological perfection which, is indeed, the supreme modality; no other existence has more views. \n \n \n So God does not posess all knowledge, but instead the most knowledge? God is not all powerful, but the most powerful?\n \n So where do these attributes start and end?\n \n So only with the idea that God is the Supreme Being you have a God that could very well lie in the physical realm, correct?\n \n \nI'd like you to expand a little on the \"laws of nature\" here before we continue. In science, we use the term \"law\" a lot, but there really are no absolute laws of science.\n\n \n When I say this I mean how the physical realm works. Matter cannot be created nor destoryed (same goes with energy). Acorns cannot suddenly zap into elephants. All things (I am aware of) in the universe are finite. Motion laws such as Newtons, etc... There is a certain order to things.\n \n \n\n As you know, science is based on empiricism - on induction. It has no room for absolute truths and it would be a mockery to it to suggest that it does. We give names such as \"Newton's Laws\", \"Ohm's Law\", \"Kirchoff's Laws\" and the like, but none of these are absolute in any sense. Firstly, that which is reached through induction can never provide absolute certainty; it can only show something to be probable. \n \n \n I don't agree here. What is not absolute about scientific laws? Science uses logic and experimination and arrives at conclusions based upon these tools. There are no other tools to use and thus it would seem we must assume these conclusions as are truth (or temporary if science develops and conclusions change).\n \n \nHowever, that is not only what we rely on. In fact, we do indeed know that all these are subject to be broken. You'll note that at the point of a singularity all our \"laws\" break down - including Relativity and it all; our equations break up and everything is meaningless. Can't really blame us - how are we meant to comprehend that which is infinitesimal.\n\n \n Yes of course there are things which science has yet to learn but this does not put it beyond the realm of the finite and understandable nor does it put it beyond the realm of reason and logic.\n \n \nSorry, but the majority of that point is pure speculation. Granted for the moment that God in \"His realm\" is no \"perfect\", as you presuppose, so what? Why would this cause a problem for the theist? The theist might easily superimpose that God, in comparison to homosapiens and all of nature is eternally perfect. Of course you can compare that which is another dimension; your point is saying that we cannot compare football and computer games - because one is a sport and the other is of something different - a computer.\n\n \n It causes not a problem on the existance of God, but the idea of a perfect supernatural God doesn't make any sense.\n But there can be made no comparsion between God and homosapians. The theist claims God is beyond human understanding, the physical realm, and beyond reason. The notion of God to some point (claims the theist) is uncomprehensible. \n Well yes of course you can compare football and computer games. There is a large difference between this and the analogy is not valid.\n We as people (claims the theist) cannot truly comprehend God who is supernatural. Although we can to large degree understand ourselves. So here we are comparing the unknowable (God) to the knowable (people). This comparison cannot occur.\n Now as to your football vs. computer game example these are both in the physical realm and are not beyond human reasoning. We understand both of these and are not in any way supernatural or unconceivable.\n Thus it is the knowable to the knowable.\n Again the notion of a \"perfect\" supernatural God is senseless. Instead God would be supernatural since we have no prior notion of the imperfect supernatural. \n You can only compare things that you can comprehend.\n \n \nYou're asking this and you're telling me that you read the Catholic article? I won't outline it all now, partly because of lack of time, but: is the point of this thread for you to learn, or to debate? You might say both, but which is primary? If it is to learn, then I think you would do well to read the article on Omnipotence; if not, you can just say and I'll answer the questions you proffered. The only reason I provide links is because the arguments proposed here are pseudoproblems, answered easily by some mild theology.\n\n \n No I did not read the entire Catholic article but rather looked for the definition of God to which we can discuss. If there is something specific you would like me to read then please point it out. \n As far as the article of Omnipotence...\n \n I have read the article but I still have a problem with God's \"omnipotence\". For you see the entire notion of the universe (which includes matter and energy) is logically impossible. Matter / Energy cannot be created or destoryed. \n You cannot have nothing and simply pop out of it some planet or star. To propose such is to propose the logically impossible as with the acorn to elephant example which I stated earlier.\n \n So to claim that God created the universe is an irrational illogical and impossible claim.\n \n \n \nSince you have presupposed in your inference three that evil exists, the burden of proof lays on your shoulder to (i) Define evil, and (ii) show that it exists.\n\n \n Oh come on. This is ridiculous. Because evil in the Christian sense is obvious.\n Dictionary.com - Causing ruin, injury, or pain; harmful\n \n I do not beleive in any kind of absolute evil. So I'll refer to what I am speaking of as \"bad\" events. These bad events are not good. They cause damage and or pain both physically and mentally. \n \n Bad events occur constantly. For these you can turn on the local news. Hear about the rape, murder, robbery, these are all \"bad\" events. \n More significant and well known \"bad\" events in history include various genocides such as in Africa and the Holocaust in Germany.\n \n The occurance of these events is undeniable. \n \n It is contradictory for a God to be all good, all powerful, and all knowing and still create the world knowing such events would occur (due to his omniscience). Also if one has the option of preventing such bad events (murder, abuse, torture) then one who is good would take the oppurunity.\n \n We both know what it is generally I am speaking of when I speak of evil and the idea of \"bad\" events is obvious.\n \n \nOn another note, let's proffer that it makes sense to say that evil exists. If a Supreme Being allowed this evil to occur, but for it to have a purpose, then things are \"all gravy\" and there's really no problem. On another note, if this God provided humans with free will moral agency, then it would not mean that he is malicious. What I mean, is that free moral agency is neither good nor evil. It is a mechanism, not an aesthetic, by which love and goodness can occur. Of course, it allows the contrapositive to occur since it is necessary - decision. One does not call a line crooked without some idea of a straight line. It can be easily argued that evil exists for us to consciously identify it from good. Paul writes, \"For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.\" \n \n \n I've heard this argument before but it doesn't hold in the face of obvious misery in the world.\n \n Events are not just caused by man's \"God given\" free will. Natural disasters occur that also cause pain and death to many at the choice of no one.\n To allow such events to occur and to be all good is contradictory.\n \n \nFinally, the POE can never be used to refute the existence of an almighty being. It only poses as \"problem\" (if you want to call it that) to those who follow the God of Classical Theism. Therefore, it does not prove the non-existence of a God. \n \n \n It doesn't disprove the existance of God. But rather is disproves the existance of an all good God.\n \n \nOn a last note, you suggest that this world is evil; tell me, which world are you comparing it to? \n \n \n I'm comparing it to a lack of evil in places of the world which also exist.\n \n But to humor you I will restate, in this existance evil exists.\n \n \n \nYou, in particular, speak of \"natural evil\" - tell me, why should I consider any of this evil. Are you proposing that an objective evil exists? Perhaps a definition (preferably not an example) of evil would suffice, here. \n \n \n www.dictionary.com\n Causing ruin, injury, or pain; harmful: the evil effects of a poor diet. \n http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=evil\n \n \nPoet- if you were provided with the evidence, would you change your stance on the existence of God, truly?\n\n \n This discussion isnt about evidence for its existance, but rather what is meant by \"its existance\". You cannot provide evidence for something that is not understood and expect me to beleive it.\n Bob: I beleive in a unie.\n Mike: What is your evidence?\n Bob: It has rained for three consecutive days... that is my evidence.\n \n No one knows what a unie is and thus the entire conversation accomplishes nothing.\n \n But as a side not in response to your question:\n If I was given solid evidence or substantial logic for the existance of God, I would beleive. Do you have some for me?\n \n unkerpaulie,\n \n \n \nsuppose that God exists, God prevents all evil, and macroevolution is true. do you think that mankind would even exist?\n\n \n My argument is now the evil that occurs as a result of nature. Not all of evil itself. Stick to the issue.\n \n \n \nand say God goes on an evil-eliminating campaign. so he ceases all tornados, floods, harsh weather, earthquakes, etc. then he cleans up pollution, then he regulates temperature to ideal climate settings (say 70 in the day, 55 at night). then he removes all cliffs and and slopes, all predators and viruses. what next? make the sea shallow so that noone can drown? make fire at a safe temperature? reduce gravity so that you fall in slowmotion? where do we draw the line?\n\n \n I'm not sure. But I don't see how this discredits my argument.\n \n Epaphras_faith,\n \n \nThere are some standards, love (agape, phileo, and eros),mercy, gentleness, kindness, lovingkindness, justice, imenent yet transcendant, omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent, etc. However, these words can only dimly convey what is truly meant by them. \n \n \n See the issues I am discussing with Dreamweaver.\n Also see post 24 in which I question some of these above proposed qualities.\n \n \nIf however, you are looking for points from theists to argue with then undoubtedly you will find those also. I am well aware of your stance on God and Jesus,as you are mine. So, suffice it to say that I will finish here. Thanks for responding to me though.

   "Ack, sorry for the ultimately late reply; I stopped checking in here some time ago. \n \n SilentPoet,\n \n Ok, first things first. For the first thing, I'd like to clarify something that might be obvious, but it helps in debate. In debate, whatever I say is what I mean - I don't really have any cryptic secret message and my words are of the standard English. \n \n I said the above particularly because some of your notions and rebuttals appear to be attacking a strawman, nothing of what I have said. Did I ever say that the Supreme Being would have the best power but not \"all\" the power? Never. If one has all the power, anyhow, they automatically have the best power. And, I thought I was pretty clear on the notion especially with regard to existence. God doesn't exist in the most possible worlds; an ontologically perfect being exists in all the possible worlds with regard to possible world semantics. This is the \"most\" amount of possible worlds that a being can exist in, but it is also all the possible worlds that a being can exist in. \n \n God does not exist in the physical realm; that is inconsistent with the idea of the Supreme Being. Such a being cannot change and is beyond time. \nWhat is not absolute about scientific laws? \n\n I'm sorry, and I need no offence to you, but this debate is going to be entirely futile if you're not versed on the make-up and foundation of science with empiricism. It is a mockery to science to even suppose that it is absolute. I know you don't like me recommending things, but you should really check out Popper on this; he's good. I fully explained why science is not absolute above - you just said that you disagreed without any reasons. Science can use logic, great, but it uses induction to reach its conclusion. Hence its non-absoluteness. \n \nWell yes of course you can compare football and computer games. There is a large difference between this and the analogy is not valid.\n\n What? Surely you have a reason for it supposedly not being a valid analogy? \n \nMatter / Energy cannot be created or destoryed. \n You cannot have nothing and simply pop out of it some planet or star. To propose such is to propose the logically impossible as with the acorn to elephant example which I stated earlier.\n\n For one, the presupposition that matter cannot be created/destroyed rests upon the \"laws\" of thermodynamics - of science. As you should know, all of the laws of science break down at the point of singularity - an infinetismal (which is where our universe came from), and consequently, we have no reason to trust any law at that point. Including general and special relativity. Check some science out, all sources will agree. \n \n With regard to evil, no, what is ridiculous is your initial presupposition that evil exists and the fact that you haven't defined your terms properly. Let's take a look at your definition:\n \n Dictionary.com - Causing ruin, injury, or pain; harmful\n \n Ok. Scenario: a friend of mine was shot by an arrow. Let's say it got in real deep. In his leg. Now, I, knowing that it would be better to take out the arrow first before anything else, I take it out. It causes him suffering, because the arrow is sharp; it causes him injury, and it causes him pain. It's evil, really? This type of definition, of evil as \"something that causes suffering\" was shown to be erroneous a very long time ago. I have a more meaningful definition of evil, to which you may not agree, but if you cannot provide one, I will. You can also define \"bad events\". And no, it's not obvious; this is philosophy, we question things, we don't just accept them because they might be a popular idea or because a lot of people do (both classical logical fallacies). The dictionary is great, but it often fails when we try to describe things properly; want an example? See \"existence\". Try to give me a definition for that, if you want; indeed, we are discussing the existence of something.\n \nEvents are not just caused by man's \"God given\" free will. Natural disasters occur that also cause pain and death to many at the choice of no one.\n\n Ok, you don't accept that - that's fine. Now justify your definition of evil as something that causes people to \"suffer\". \n \nI'm comparing it to a lack of evil in places of the world which also exist.\n\n Oh, ok. So you don't think that the world is \"evil\"? Just a few questions for now; more later.",

   "Just to clarify, you beleive that God is ALL powerful? (Meaning capable of doing anything). If this is the case then is God capable of doing the impossible, such as changing something inanimate into a concious being?\nHeh, you've got an interesting definition of \"all\"; your \"all\" here seems to include that which does not exist. You probably don't see the absurdity in the presupposition, but I'll give you an analogy to show the problem:\n \n A scenario. We had a test in Math yesterday, and today, we got our test results. A friend of mine asks me, \"how many marks did you get right on the test?\" I reply, \"I got all the marks right\" (as if ;)). Now, surely, from this we would think that I got 100% on my test, but by your reasoning, I should have got something like oo%, since, \"all\" here should also--apparently--include that which is impossible. Of course, that never happens. We are not concerned with the impossible -- the impossible can never occur. Period. \n \n Maybe it's best to think of it in terms of Modal Logic, too. When using possible world semantics and we define ontological perfection as that which exists in all the possible worlds, we are not concerned, obviously, with the impossible worlds. Because, quite frankly, because they do not exist. Nevertheless, I'm interested by your presupposition that it is impossible for inaminate objects to be conscious. (i) What do you base this on? (ii) and how do you explain the miracle before your eyes, therefore.\n\n I'm not following. When one refers to something existing in something, that usually means it exists in some physical sense whether as a form of matter or energy. But since God is neither but is rather supernatural how could he exist in \"all the possible worlds\". \n Wouldn't God rather be outside of these worlds and rather not exist in them.\nI think you've misunderstood the use of possible world semantics. For one, they patently don't only refer to the physical, but to everything, and neither do they make appeals to materialism and/or other types of monism/dualism. As they stand, they at least appear compatible with other metaphysical concepts as such. On another note, possible world semantics makes no such claim to presuppose anything along the lines of that these worlds exist. They are but a tool for understanding different parts of the modal family, in particular -- the popular S5. You seem to be appealing to materialism, however, which would of course pretty much eliminate the concept of a Supreme Being as is described, but lucky for us, materialism as I see it has major flaws. I'll outline them if you wish; just say. \nThe fault is obviously my own.\nNo worry there; just check out a little bit of Philosophy of Science; as I suggested, Popper is good, but maybe a little cryptic. Introductory books are normally good, however. \nI could come up with tons of examples of what I mean by evil. Would this help you to understand what I mean?\nUnfortunately not, and that is one of the problems with a definition as such for \"evil\". They're always either circular or just plain erroneous. Examples are fine and dandy, but definitions are required. Since you are positing that evil exists as one of your central premises, I want to know what you mean by it before I can agree that it exists; surely, that's reasonable, is it not? \n \n For thinking about evil, I like to consider some aspects of science and other things as such. For example, light and darkness. If you think about darkness, you'll find that it, itself, has no substance, but that it is only light that has substance. We see a lot of opposites in nature -- electrons and positrons, matter and anti-matter. But, there are those particles that do not have an opposite; for example, a photon is electrically neutral, just like the other force carriers: Z bosons and gluons. When something is light, we know that photons are coming from or being reflected of somethingn and then reaching our eye. Light is photons. However, for darkness, there is no other particle -- no particle that provides darkness. Darkness itself is merely the absence of light.\n \n Another parallel might be seen with coldness and heat. Heat comes about from energy, more specifically -- thermal energy. What we call \"cold\" is but an absence of heat (never a complete absence, since that would propose absolute zero on a Kelvin scale, which, theoretically, we never could really measure -- temperatures for us never get near that low). When we say that a person is \"cold\" we mean that they are lacking in emotion.\n \n And from these, I think it is the same with goodness. Goodness is that which exists and evil is merely the privation of it. It works this way and not the other way around because goodness is the aesthetic, in that case, it is that which morally edifies. Evil is merely the essence of moral emptiness. \n \n I think I've said a lot, and I wouldn't want to drag on and say a whole lot more; good luck with your computer and I hope it works out. Hey, when you get back, maybe we can get to the problem of good. ;)",

   "Silent Poet:\n \n I too am having difficulty with computer things so I apologize for a late reply.\n \n Suffice it to say I am sufficiently out of the loop so I will only respond to one thing you said. You said in an earlier post that you agreed that the presence of evil does not disprove the existence of God just the existence of an ALL GOOD God. \n \n I beg to differ. The presence of Evil is necessary to show love. If there were no evil then there would be no need to depend on God and we could suffice just fine without him. This means that he does not get to show His love which is his primary nature. \n \n Even if you disagree with the above, which I think you do, it still does not PROVE the non existence of an all Good God. Just because you and I cannot reconcile with the presence of Evil that does not mean that God is not Good. If you say that because evil exists then God cannot be good then you are setting yourself up as the definer of what is good. However, if you accept the existence, or potential existence of a God, any god, then He must be the definer of what is good. By discussing the attributes of God then you necessarily stipulate to His existence. The question is \"what is he like?\" If he is creator, and no christian would say he is loving or good without also saying he is creator, then you must also accept as creator that HE is the one who defines what is good. Allowing for the possiblity of the existence of evil He has defined as good. Why, because HE, the creator says so. Therefore, it does not disprove the existence of a good god. I also say that it does not prove the existence of a good god. \n \n Again, it is a matter of what you believe. No one can prove or disprove. Even our discussion here has had to include some assumptions and therefore beliefs.\n \n Have a good week. I may be back in a week or two. Right now this is the most I can post. \n \n Blessings and grace to everyone",

Now I got my computer back and the floppy drive doesnt work. emoticon_angry \n \n \nHeh, you've got an interesting definition of \"all\"; your \"all\" here seems to include that which does not exist. You probably don't see the absurdity in the presupposition, but I'll give you an analogy to show the problem:\n \n A scenario. We had a test in Math yesterday, and today, we got our test results. A friend of mine asks me, \"how many marks did you get right on the test?\" I reply, \"I got all the marks right\" (as if ). Now, surely, from this we would think that I got 100% on my test, but by your reasoning, I should have got something like oo%, since, \"all\" here should also--apparently--include that which is impossible. Of course, that never happens. We are not concerned with the impossible -- the impossible can never occur. Period\n\n \n Your right. \n \n \nSince you are positing that evil exists as one of your central premises, I want to know what you mean by it before I can agree that it exists; surely, that's reasonable, is it not? \n \n \n I suppose, but I don't take my earlier idea that evil exists.\n \n I can no longer argue this point until I come up with some sort of definition to go by.\n Hmm...\n \n Epaphras_faith\n \n \nI too am having difficulty with computer things so I apologize for a late reply.\n\n \n If my computer messes up on me again I'm going to feel like scrapping it and buy a new one.\n \n \nI beg to differ.

This means that he does not get to show His love which is his primary nature. \n \n \n Hmm, I disagree. \n First off, even if this was true this does not in any way justify the allowing or purposeful creation and plan of such evil (human and natural). \n Now while maybe I would let you get away with arguing that some form of bad must be present to show good, this does not account for the extremity of the suffering and events that occur.\n \n \nEven if you disagree with the above, which I think you do, it still does not PROVE the non existence of an all Good God.

   "The odd thing about this is Muhammedans say that they 'respect' the Holy Books of the Jews and the Christians (viz The Bible) but the Bible itself quite clearly says God is triune in nature.\n \n \n \n What Do Muslims Think About Jesus? \n \n \n \n \"Muslims respect and revere Jesus. They consider him one of the greatest of God's prophets and messengers to humankind. A Muslim never refers to him simply as \"Jesus\", but always adds the phrase \"upon him be peace.\" \n \n The Qur'an confirms his virgin birth, and a special surah of the Qur'an is entitled \"Mary.\" The Qur'an describes the Annunciation as follows: \n \n \"'Behold (O Mary!)' The Angel said, 'God has chosen you, and purified you, and chosen you above the women of all nations. O Mary, God gives you good news of a word from Him, whose name shall be the Anointed (Masih or Messiah), Jesus son of Mary, honored in this world and in the hereafter, and one of those brought near to God. He shall speak to the people from his cradle and in maturity, and shall be of the righteous.' \n \n \"She said: 'O my Lord! How shall I have a son when no man has touched me?' He said: 'Even so; God creates what He wills. When He decrees a thing, He says to it, \"Be!\" and it is.'\" (Qur'an 3:42-7) \n \n Jesus was born miraculously through the same power that had brought Adam into being without a father: \"Truly the likeness of Jesus with God is as the likeness of Adam. He created him of dust and then said to him, 'Be!' and he was.\" (Qur'an 3:59) \n \n During his prophetic mission, Jesus performed many miracles. The Qur'an tells us that he said:\n \"I have come to you with a sign from your Lord: I make for you out of clay, as it were, a figure of a bird, and breathe into it and it becomes a bird by God's leave. And I heal the blind, and the lepers, and I raise the dead by God's leave.\" (Qur'an 3:49) \n \n Neither Muhammad nor Jesus came to change the basic doctrine of the belief in One God, brought by earlier prophets, but to confirm and renew it. In the Qur'an, Jesus is reported as saying that he came: \"To attest the law which was before me. And to make lawful to you part of what was forbidden to you; I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, so fear God and obey me.\" (Qur'an 3:50) \n \n The Prophet Muhammad said:\n \"Whoever believes that there is none worthy of worship but God, alone without partner, that Muhammad is His messenger, that Jesus is the servant and messenger of God, His word which He bestowed on Mary and a spirit proceeding from Him, and that Paradise and Hell are true, shall be received by God into Heaven.\" (A Hadith from the collections of al Bukhari)\"\n http://discover.islamway.com/articles.php?article_id=15",

   "The odd thing about this is Muhammedans say that they 'respect' the Holy Books of the Jews and the Christians (viz The Bible) but the Bible itself quite clearly says God is triune in nature. \n \n \n \n Who Invented Trinity?\n \n \"The three monotheistic religions - Judaism, Christianity, and Islam - all purport to share one fundamental concept: belief in God as the Supreme Being, the Creator and Sustainer of the Universe. Known as \"tawhid\" in Islam, this concept of the Oneness of God was stressed by Moses in a Biblical passage known as the \"Shema,\" or the Jewish creed of faith: \n \n \"Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord.\" (Deuteronomy 6:4) \n \n \n It was repeated word-for-word approximately 1500 years later by Jesus when he said: \n \n \"...The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; the Lord our God is one Lord.\" (Mark 12:29)\n \n Muhammad came along approximately 600 years later, bringing the same message again: \n \n \"And your God is One God: There is no God but He, ...\" (The Qur'an 2:163)\n \n Christianity has digressed from the concept of the Oneness of God, however, into a vague and mysterious doctrine that was formulated during the fourth century. This doctrine, which continues to be a source of controversy both within and without the Christian religion, is known as the Doctrine of the Trinity. Simply put, the Christian doctrine of the Trinity states that God is the union of three divine persons - the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit - in one divine being. If that concept, put in basic terms, sounds confusing, the flowery language in the actual text of the doctrine lends even more mystery to the matter: \n \n \n \"...we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity... for there is one Person of the Father, another of the Son, another of the Holy Ghost is all one... they are not three gods, but one God... the whole three persons are co-eternal and co-equal... he therefore that will be save must thus think of the Trinity...\" (excerpts from the Athanasian Creed) \n \n \n Let's put this together in a different form: one person, God the Father + one person, God the Son + one person, God the Holy Ghost = one person, God the What? Is this English or is this gibberish? It is said that Athanasius, the bishop who formulated this doctrine, confessed that the more he wrote on the matter, the less capable he was of clearly expressing his thoughts regarding it. How did such a confusing doctrine get its start? \n \n \n TRINITY IN THE BIBLE\n References in the Bible to a Trinity of divine beings are vague, at best. In Matthew 28:19, we find Jesus telling his disciples to go out and preach to all nations. While the \"Great Commission\" does make mention of the three persons who later become components of the Trinity, the phrase \"...baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost\" is quite clearly an addition to Biblical text - that is, not the actual words of Jesus - as can be seen by two factors: \n \n \n 1) Baptism in the early Church, as discussed by Paul in his letters, was done only in the name of Jesus; and \n 2) The \"Great Commission\" was found in the first gospel written, that of Mark, bears no mention of Father, Son and/or Holy Ghost - see Mark 16:15.\n \n The only other reference in the Bible to a Trinity can be found in the Epistle of John 5:7, Biblical scholars of today, however, have admitted that the phrase \"...there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one\" is definitely a \"later addition\" to Biblical text, and it is not found in any of today's versions of the Bible. It can, therefore, be seen that the concept of a Trinity of divine beings was not an idea put forth by Jesus or any other prophet of God. This doctrine, now subscribed to by Christians all over the world, is entirely man-made in origin. \n \n \n THE DOCTRINE TAKES SHAPE\n While Paul of Tarsus, the man who could rightfully be considered the true founder of Christianity, did formulate many of its doctrines, that of the Trinity was not among them. He did, however, lay the groundwork for such when he put forth the idea of Jesus being a \"divine Son.\" After all, a Son does need a Father, and what about a vehicle for God's revelations to man? In essence, Paul named the principal players, but it was the later Church people who put the matter together. Tertullian, a lawyer and presbyter of the third century Church in Carthage, was the first to use the word \"Trinity\" when he put forth the theory that the Son and the Spirit participate in the being of God, but all are of one being of substance with the Father. \n \n \n A FORMAL DOCTRINE IS DRAWN UP\n When controversy over the matter of the Trinity blew up in 318 between two church men from Alexandria - Arius, the deacon, and Alexander, his bishop - Emperor Constantine stepped into the fray. Although Christian dogma was a complete mystery to him, he did realize that a unified church was necessary for a strong kingdom. When negotiation failed to settle the dispute, Constantine called for the first ecumenical council in Church history in order to settle the matter once and for all. Six weeks after the 300 bishops first gathered at Nicea in 325, the doctrine of the Trinity was hammered out. The God of the Christians was now seen as having three essences, or natures, in the form of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. \n \n \n THE CHURCH PUTS ITS FOOT DOWN\n The matter was far from settled, however, despite high hopes for such on the part of Constantine. Arius and the new bishop of Alexandria, a man named Athanasius, began arguing over the matter even as the Nicene Creed was being signed; \"Arianism\" became a catch-word from that time onward for anyone who did not hold to the doctrine of the Trinity. It wasn't until 451, at the Council of Chalcedon that, with the approval of the Pope, the Nicene/Constantinople Creed was set as authoritative. Debate on the matter was no longer tolerated; to speak out against the Trinity was now considered blasphemy, and such earned stiff sentences that ranged from mutilation to death. Christians now turned on Christians, maiming and slaughtering thousands because of a difference of opinion. \n \n \n DEBATE CONTINUES\n Brutal punishments and even death did not stop the controversy over the doctrine of the Trinity, however, and the said controversy continues even today. The majority of Christians, when asked to explain this fundamental doctrine of their faith, can offer nothing more than \"I believe it because I was told to do so.\" It is explained away as \"mystery\" - yet the Bible says in I Corinthians 14:33 that \"... God is not the author of confusion...\" The Unitarian denomination of Christianity has kept alive the teachings of Arius in saying that God is one; they do not believe in the Trinity. As a result, mainstream Christians abhor them, and the National Council of Churches has refused their admittance. In Unitarianism, the hope is kept alive that Christians will someday return to the preachings of Jesus: \n \n \"...Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.\" (Luke 4:8) \n \n \n ISLAM AND THE MATTER OF THE TRINITY\n While Christianity may have a problem defining the essence of God, such is not the case in Islam. \"They do blaspheme who say: Allah is one of three in a Trinity, for there is no god except One God.\" (Qur'an 5:73) It is worth noting that the Arabic language Bible uses the name \"Allah\" as the name of God. Suzanne Haneef, in her book WHAT EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT ISLAM AND MUSLIMS (Library of Islam, 1985), puts the matter quite succinctly when she says, \"But God is not like a pie or an apple which can be divided into three thirds which form one whole; if God is three persons or possesses three parts, He is assuredly not the Single, Unique, Indivisible Being which God is and which Christianity professes to believe in.\" (pp. 183-184) \n \n Looking at it from another angle, the Trinity designates God as being three separate entities - the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. If God is the Father and also the Son, He would then be the Father of Himself because He is His own Son. This is not exactly logical. Christianity claims to be a monotheistic religion. Monotheism, however, has as its fundamental belief that God is One; the Christian doctrine of the Trinity - God being Three-in-One - is seen by Islam as a form of polytheism. Christians don't revere just One God, they revere three. This is a charge not taken lightly by Christians, however. They, in turn, accuse the Muslims of not even knowing what the Trinity is, pointing out that the Qur'an sets it up as Allah the Father, Jesus the Son, and Mary his mother. While veneration of Mary has been a figment of the Catholic Church since 431 when she was given the title \"Mother of God\" by the Council of Ephesus, a closer examination of the verse in the Qur'an most often cited by Christians in support of their accusation, shows that the designation of Mary by the Qur'an as a \"member\" of the Trinity, is simply not true. While the Qur'an does condemn both trinitarianism (the Qur'an 4:17) and the worship of Jesus and his mother Mary (the Qur'an 5:116), nowhere does it identify the actual three components of the Christian Trinity. The position of the Qur'an is that WHO or WHAT comprises this doctrine is not important; what is important is that the very notion of a Trinity is an affront against the concept of One God. \n \n In conclusion, we see that the doctrine of the Trinity is a concept conceived entirely by man; there is no sanction whatsoever from God to be found regarding the matter simply because the whole idea of a Trinity of divine beings has no place in monotheism. In the Qur'an, God's Final Revelations to mankind, we find His stand quite clearly stated in a number of eloquent passages: \n \n \n \"...your God is One God: whoever expects to meet his Lord, let him work righteousness, and, in the worship of his Lord, admit no one as partner.\" (Qur'an 18:110) \n \"...take not, with God, another object of worship, lest you should be thrown into Hell, blameworthy and rejected.\" (Qur'an 17:39) \n ...Because, as God tells us over and over again in a Message that is echoed throughout All His Revealed Scriptures: \"...I am your Lord and Cherisher: therefore, serve Me (and no other)...\" (Qur'an 21:92) \"\n http://www.islam101.com/religions/22_trinity.html",

   "In the New Testament, we find the clear teaching of one God (I Tim. 2:5), and at the same time we are told that the Father is God (Romans 1:7), the Son is God (John 20:28), and the Holy Spirit is God (Acts 5:3-4).\n \n You must remember too that 1 x 1 x 1 = 1. He is still one God.\n \n Truthkeeper, you have ignored (again) volumes of evidence (it gives your username an ironic quality).\n \n Genesis 1\n 26 Then God said, \"Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.\"\n \n The very first chapter of the first book of the Bible has God reveal His nature.\n \n Isaiah 6\n 8 Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, \"Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?\"\n \n These are further evidences FROM THE OLD TESTAMENT...\n \n \"1. The use of plural forms.\n \n Pronouns, where God speaking, uses \"us\" and \"our\": Genesis 3:22 Genesis 11:7 Isaiah 6:8. The most important reference is Genesis 1:26-27; it is here where the plurality is used in connection with the very nature of God. This last reference is the most important (and compelling) one because here God uses plural forms in the context of his own \"image and likeness.\"\n \n \n The plural form for \"Lord\" used frequently in the Old Testament:'adonai (\"Lord,\" literally, \"my Masters\"). The vowel in the last syllable of 'adonai was apparently lengthened by rabbis in the post-New Testament period. This is thought to have been done to sharpen the distinction between earthly lords and the Lord God. \n \n \n The Old Testament had a singular term for God, Eloah, which they occasionally used, but the vast majority of the time the plural form of God, Elohim, is used throughout the Old Testament. Had there been only be two persons within God, the Hebrews could have used a dual form Elohiayim, which was typically (although not always) used of things that occured in pairs.\n \n 2. Usage of \"one\" in a composite sense.\n \n Even though the Old Testament teaches that God is \"one,\" (Deuteronomy 6:4) this does not conflict in any way with Trinitarian beliefs. On the contrary, it actually helps to affirm them. One of the most compelling examples in the Old Testament of the composite sense of \"one\" is found in Genesis 2:24. Two people (created in the \"image\" of God) become \"one flesh\" in the marriage union (and thus a sense of the \"image\" in a composite sense). The use of the Hebrew word for \"one\" (eXad) in other passages similarly demonstrates that this word means \"one entity\" rather than a strictly single, solitary thing. \n 3. Theophanies, where Christ appears in the form of the \"Angel (or Messenger) of the Lord.\"\n \n The Old Testament presents striking examples of a Being who, although He appears in the form of a man, acts and speaks like God and is referred to as God. Mysteriously, He is both identified as God and distinguished from God. We find this in passages such as Genesis 16:7-13; 18-19; 22:11-18; Exodus 3:2-6; 23:20-23; Judges 6:11-14, 20-22; 13:21-23). Note also how Zechariah 12:8 equates God and the Angel of the Lord. These Theophanies were prepartory for the incarnation in that they anticipated the coming of a Heavenly Visitor who would one day be both truly God and man. \n 4. The \"Son\" passages:\n \n The Old Testament describes a Being who is uniquely a human-divine Son. In the light of the New Testament we see that Jesus in His Being is the fulfillment of the Son of Man, the Son of God, and the Son-King (of which Solomon was a foreshadowing).\n \n Proverbs 30:4\n \n Isaiah 9:6 He is a son and child, but also the \"mighty God.\" \n \n Psalm 2:7-12 (although the translation of \"son\" in verse 12 can be disputed) This Psalm describes a Son-King who receives the nations as His inheritance. \n \n Daniel 7:13-14 This passage forms the background behind Christ's use of the Messianic title \"Son of Man.\" Note that the contexts of Psalm 2 and Daniel 7 have identical strands of thought: the inheriting of all the kingdoms of the earth. The word \"Son of Man\" does not here mean \"a mortal man\"--one from among the \"sons of men.\" The point here is not that the Person is perfectly human. The significance of the title \"Son of Man' in this passage is fourfold:\n \n \n His exalted personality as the One who comes from heaven and opposes the beastly human powers, which come from earth (Daniel 7:3)\n \n His advent in conjunction with the reappearance of the theophanic glory cloud (7:13),\n \n His free access to the 'One who is an ancient of days' (God the Father, 7:13), and\n \n His universal and everlasting reign (7:14). (J. B. Payne, Theology of the Older Testament, p. 265.)\n \n 5. The use of pronouns suggesting more than one Person within God.\n \n The LORD talking, uses both \"Me\" and \"Him\" referring to the same Being (Christ) in Zechariah 12:10 \n The Angel of the Lord speaking, uses both \"from Me\" and \"fearer of God\" in referring to the same entity (Genesis 22:12). \n 6. Passages that identify two Beings as God or LORD (YHWH). \n \n Genesis 19:23 (YHWH in heaven versus YHWH on earth) \n Psalm 45:6-7 (God referring to Another as \"God\") \n Zechariah 3:1-2 (YHWH calling upon YHWH: \"And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan\"\n \n 7. The Holy Spirit is linked with God and given attributes of personality.\n \n All three Persons of the Trinity can be seen in Isaiah 63:8-10, but most importantly we see here the personality of the Holy Spirit. He is \"vexed, grieved\" by disobedience. This verb in Hebrew is always used in conjuntion with persons (or God and gods); never of inanimate things\n http://www.biblicalresources.info/pages/ot1/trinityot.html\n \n The ancient Semitic name for God may also contain some hint of plurality in the Godhead. Elohim is the plural of el ?God.? Again, is this merely a grammatical peculiarity or a cryptic reference to the Trinity to be fully revealed in the New Testament? Isaiah 6:3, with the seraphim calling ?Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts,? has also been taken as an indication of the triuneness of God. And it is interesting that the seraphim have three sets of wings with which to veil themselves.\n http://www.catholic.net/rcc/Periodicals/Faith/1998-01-02/trinity.html\n \n Proofs for a Trinity abound in the earliest Christian writings...(note, I am an Orthodox Christian so I will also be giving extra-Biblical quotes as well).\n \n \n \n Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever. Your argument is that everywhere we've got the Greek mixed up - we who compiled the Bible in Greek! In effect your argument is, that if you re-write the Bible your Bible interpretations are correct - because we hold true to the Orthodox dogmatic teaching that we've always held.\n \n They are one...\n \n I John 5\n \n 7\n \n \"There are those that bear record in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit: and these three are one\"\n \n \n \n Jesus said John 10\n \n 38\n \n But if I do it, even though you do not believe me, believe the miracles, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.\" \n \n \n \n They are of one accord\n \n John 5\n \n 21\n \n For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it. \n \n \n \n Jesus is equal to God\n \n Colossians 1\n \n 19\n \n \"For God was pleased to have all His fullness dwell in Him\"\n \n \n \n Jesus has the power and wisdom of God\n \n 1 Cor 1\n \n 24\n \n \"...Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.\"\n \n \n \n Jesus Himself commanded\n \n Matthew 28\n \n 19\n \n Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit\n \n In this passage, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are said to share one name (notice that the term \"name\" is singular, not plural), and that name is almost certainly Yahweh, the personal name of God in the Bible. We know this because the name Yahweh is applied to both the Father and the Son in the New Testament. \n \n \n \n \n Jesus is eternal like God\n \n Hebrews 13: 8\n Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.\n \n \n \n St. Ignatius of Antioch was a disciple of St. Peter and he wrote...\n \n Epistle to the Magnesians\n \n \"CHAPTER 7\n \n 7:1 Therefore as the Lord did nothing without the Father, [being united with Him],\"\n \n http://www.earlychristianwritings.c...-lightfoot.html\n \n \n \n The unity of them is continually repeated...\n \n He opens his Epistle to the Philadelphians\n \n \"Ignatius, who is also Theophorus, to the church of God the Father and of Jesus Christ, which is in Philadelphia of Asia...\"\n \n http://www.earlychristianwritings.c...-lightfoot.html\n \n Epistle to the Magnesians\n \n \n \n Again in his opening address to his Epistle the Romans\n \n \"Ignatius, who is also Theophorus, unto her that hath found mercy in the bountifulness of the Father Most High and of Jesus Christ His only Son; to the church that is beloved and enlightened through the will of Him who willed all things that are, by faith\n \n \n and love towards Jesus Christ our God; even unto her that hath the presidency in the country of the region of the Romans, being worthy of God, worthy of honour, worthy of felicitation, worthy of praise, worthy of success, worthy in purity, and having the presidency of love, walking in the law of Christ and bearing the Father's name; which church also I salute in the name\n \n of Jesus Christ the Son of the Father; unto them that in flesh and spirit are united unto His every commandment, being filled with the grace of God without wavering, and filtered clear from every foreign stain; abundant greeting in Jesus Christ our God in blamelessness.\"\n \n http://www.earlychristianwritings.c...-lightfoot.html\n \n \n \n Note Jesus is His only Son. He is given a special status from that of any other person - no prophet here is mentioned.\n \n \n \n God and Jesus, Jesus and God. He says Jesus is the only Son of God, no mention that Satan is a co-creation equal to Jesus. Jesus is the Son of God, He is also God.\n \n \n Epistle to the Ephesians\n \n CHAPTER 5\n \n 5:1 For if I in a short time had such converse with your bishop, which was not after the manner of men but in the Spirit, how much more do I congratulate you who are closely joined with him as the Church is with Jesus Christ and as Jesus Christ is with the Father, that all things may be harmonious in unity.\n \n http://www.earlychristianwritings.c...-lightfoot.html\n \n \n \n That is, unity of the community, of the church, of Christ with God.\n \n \n But also 'three' comes up so many times,\n \n Further in his Epistle to the Ephesians\n \n CHAPTER 19\n \n 19:1 And hidden from the prince of this world were the virginity of Mary and her child-bearing and likewise also the death of the Lord -- three mysteries to be cried aloud -- the which were wrought in the silence of God.\n \n Ibid\n \n \"The episkopoi's immediate subordinates were the `presbyteroi' and the `diakonoi' who together with him constituted the higher Kleroi, a trinity if you will: the Father (episkopos), Son (diakonos) and spirit-filled apostolic council (presbyteroi)\"\n \n http://www.thecosmiccontext.de/chri.../Ignatius1.html\n \n As stated earlier, the organisation of the Church reflected the triune nature of God. One Church, three offices of clergy.\n \n \n \n This reflects the passages in Scripture that say that Jesus was with the fullness of God, that is, they are united, and they are equal.\n \n 1 Cor 1\n \n 24\n \n \"...Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.\"\n \n \n \n Which is why Jesus Himself commanded\n \n Matthew 28\n \n 19\n \n Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, \n \n \n \n Thus the Didache* (written after 50 AD but before 120AD; and again, well before some of the books of the Bible were written) states...\n \n 7:1 But concerning baptism, thus shall ye baptise.\n \n 7:2 Having first recited all these things, baptise in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit in living (running) water.\n \n http://www.earlychristianwritings.c...-lightfoot.html\n \n \n \n Thus the Trinity was know well before the Bible was even put together.\n \n \n \n Peter tells us, \"David did not ascend into the heavens; but he himself says, ?The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, till I make your enemies a stool for your feet.? Let all the house of Israel therefore know assuredly that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified\" (Acts 2:34?36). Here God is \"the Lord\" who speaks to \"my Lord,\" Jesus. When one looks at the Old Testament quotation, one finds, \"Yahweh says to my Lord: ?Sit at my right hand, till I make your enemies your footstool?\" (Ps. 110:1); so here the Father is called Yahweh. \n \n In Philippians 2:10?11, we read: \"[A]t the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.\" This is a reference to Isaiah 45:18?24, which tells us: \"I, Yahweh, speak the truth . . . I am God, and there is no other. By myself I have sworn. . . . To me every knee shall bow, every tongue confess. ?Only in Yahweh,? it shall be said of me, ?are righteousness and strength.? \" Here Paul applies the prophecy of every knee bending and every tongue confessing to Jesus, resulting in the prophecy that they will \"confess that Jesus Christ is Yahweh.\" The stress on Christ as God is also picked up by the early Church Fathers (e.g., Ignatius, below). \n \n Jesus himself declares that he is Yahweh (\"I AM,\" in English translation). In John 8:58, when questioned about how he has special knowledge of Abraham, Jesus replies, \"Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I AM.\" His audience understood exactly who he was claiming to be. \"So they took up stones to throw at him; but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple\" (John 8:59). \n \n \n \n With the personal name of God, Yahweh, being applied to both the Father and the Son, it is almost certainly applied to the Spirit, and thus to all three members of the Trinity. \n \n \n \n The parallelism of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is not unique to Matthew?s Gospel, but appears elsewhere in the New Testament (e.g., 2 Cor. 13:14, Heb. 9:14), as well as in the writings of the earliest Christians, who clearly understood them in the sense that we do today?that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three divine persons who are one divine being (God).\n \n http://www.catholic.com/library/Trinity.asp\n \n \n Lastly, if you have the time, there's an interesting article at\n http://www.visi.com/~contra_m/ab/schirrmacher/trinoldt.html",
