   "Death of former Yugoslavia strongman Milosevic in Hague is rather insipid. It wouldn't be a big revelation if I'd say he had been CIA mole for years. You can find lots of relevant info in mass media and Inet. Needless to say he was a smart mole very helpful of the brazen American effort to subdue Kosovo and make it its strategically important huge military base to go on with their far reaching plans. I mean Balkans are part of the American concept of \"Broader Middle East\". The one in possession of the Balkans gets clue to control Black sea transport routes to Caspian and Middle East oil. Of all Yugoslavia territories mainly mountainous only Kosovo plain could fit well USA military base project. They needed this piece of territory but they needed it deserted without any Serbs or Albanians. That's why they provoked those ethnic clashes and violence and then carried out those merciless carpet bombings. Milosevic was just their means then. I don't know details of course but later on they lost control of him or something like that. Or perhaps they just didn't need them any more. \n Anyway I am absolutely sure he knew a lot about American highly suspicious involvement in Kosovo. It was kind of unflattering compromising stuff (using WMD by Americans possibly!) able to damage America's image greately.\n That's why they put him into that Hague prison. And then they killed him there by means of \"incorrect treatment\" or \"wrong drugs\" or doesn't matter what. Milocevic didn't get his chance to use his trump ace against USA in wide public. Perhaps we'll learn the truth a bit later.\n \n PS And that Hague Tribunal prison os one of those scandalous secret CIA prisons in Europe I s'pose. LOL",
