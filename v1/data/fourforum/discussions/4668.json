Some teachings of religion are not classified as \"knowledge\", they are \"dogma\", like much of christianity. Some othere religions are based more on spirituality, or philosophy, centering around wisdom and knowledge, these can in many ways, be religions based on \"knowledge\" or science. It all depends on what flavor of mythology we're discussing. So science and religions in that way, are not mutually exclsuive, there is not dichotomy.\n \n \n #1 Your statement that science is considered as absolute truth is misleading. I'm quite certain that rational individuals, both rational scientists and non-scientists (i.e. thinking people) regards all science as falsifiable based on evidence. Else, it wouldn't be science. If scientific claims were all \"absolutes\", they wouldn't need evidence, it would be similar to the bible in that scientists would publish \"absolutes\", and disagreeing or agreeing would be irrelevant. There also wouldn't be a scientific \"method\", peer review, experimentation....none of this would have any meaning. \n \n #2 Fundamentalists can be ridiculed because they believe in ridiculous things, for ridiculous reasons. Is there some other reason to ridicule someone?\n Is ridiculing constructive? Probably not, it's an emotional release. The best way I know of to combat the problem of ignorance is through education.\n \n #3 Your average atheists rejects things that are irrational, or are not shown, through evidence, to be true. Judge this however you like, it's rational defensible. The bible, for instance, is not.\n \n -Mach",
