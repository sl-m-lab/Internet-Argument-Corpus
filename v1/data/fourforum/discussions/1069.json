   "A note to the text below.\n 'Sura' refers to a reference in the Koran.\n \n Islam: Inrtoduction \n Islam & Women\n \n As the popular song goes ?People are the same wherever you go, there is good and bad in everyone.? [1]\n \n Some belief systems are secular (e.g. nationalism, socialism, liberalism), some are religious (e.g. Christianity, Buddhism, Judaism). It is important to note that some of these belief systems are not good; by this I mean they evoke hatred or violence, or inequality; such as Nazism. Some belief systems superficially evoke feelings of equality. The Children of God (known to themselves as ?The Family?) preach ?free love.? Ostensibly this might sit well with your own beliefs, but dig a little deeper, and you discover that ?The Family? believe that intercourse between adults and children is permissible. Clearly, ?free love? has gone too far. When a member of a belief system tells you that they believe in ?free love? it is important to look to how they actually practice this belief. Likewise, if a believer tells you that he is in favour of one thing, you must look to his teachings to see if this is so.\n \n As I have shown, some belief systems are harmful. It is the purpose of this post to show that Islam is one of these harmful belief systems.\n \n If you persuade me to go and join you in a robbery, it could be said that I have acted on your instructions. If you made no such entreaty, and I commit the robbery, and then claim I did it ?in your name? then clearly you can not be blamed at all for what I did. Similarly, many things are done in the name of belief systems. Most known, the Crusades, seem to be an act done, ?in the name of Jesus.? But, any cursory study of the words of Jesus show that only peace was taught. Clearly then, those who acted in the name of Jesus, did so in a manner that should not bring discredit to Jesus.\n \n Muslims believe in the Koran. For them it is the unaltered word of their god, Allah. In the eyes of a Muslim, there can?t be any argument against the Koran, because to do so, you are arguing against their god. Next in line to the Koran are the Haddiths. These are the sayings and doings of the Muslim prophet Muhammed and some of his followers. These texts are more elaborate and detailed than the Koran and are important to Muslims as they elaborate their faith.[2] In this post I will quote from Koranic [3] and Haddith sources. You may also wish to bear in mind the following question ?Do the believers of Islam also practice these words??\n \n Are women equal in Islam? ?Men have fear of your Lord, who created you from a single soul. From that soul He created its mate and through them He bestrewed the earth with countless men and women? (Sura 4:1). This clearly suggests that men and women were created from the same substance? Muslims will point to this as ?proof? that men and women are considered equal in Islam. However, Sura 2:228 states ?Women shall with justice have rights similar to those exercised against them, although men have a status above women.? [4] However this difference in status runs much deeper. In legal testimony, ?Call in two male witnesses from among you, but if two men cannot be found, then one man and two women whom you judge fit to act as witnesses?? (Sura 2:282), in other words a woman?s testimony is worth half of a man?s.\n \n Can Muslim women be beaten? ?Good women are obedient. They guard their unseen parts because God has guarded them. As for those from whom you fear disobedience, admonish them and send them to beds apart and beat them? (Sura 4:34)? though some Islamic scholars claim that this is a symbolic ?beating? only where-by the husband just ?taps? his wife on the arm. Although the wording does not say it should be but a symbolic tap, it should be noted anyway that it still points to male domination over women.\n \n Islam gave rights to women. This is a statement the Muslim faithful will make. It is true, but like the claim mentioned earlier made by ?The Family?, it is only part of the picture. On the death of her husband, a Muslim woman is guaranteed rights of inheritence, and divorce was granted to Muslim women long before Western women ever were considered such a right. However, what exactly do they mean by rights?? She is allowed half as much as a male relative.\n \n It is clear that Muhammed ?loved? women, he kept nine wives and numerous concubines. But is this love? What did he invoke his followers to do? \"Omar reported from the Holy Prophet (Muhammed) who said, 'No man shall be questioned for beating his wife.'\" (Al Hadis, Vol. 1, p. 215) \n \"The prophet said: 'When a man calls his wife to bed and she does not come, the husband spends the night being angry with her, and the angels curse her until morning. The one who is in heaven is displeased with her until the husband is pleased with her.'\"(Sahih hadith, chapter 558) \n \n \"The Prophet (Muhammed) said: 'I was shown the Hell-fire and that the majority of its dwellers were women who were ungrateful.' It was asked, 'Do they disbelieve in Allah?' (or are they ungrateful to Allah?) He replied, 'They are ungrateful to their husbands and are ungrateful for the favours and the good (charitable deeds) done to them. If you have always been good (benevolent) to one of them and then she sees something in you (not of her liking), she will say, 'I have never received any good from you.'\" (Hadith, Sahih Bukhari 1:2:28) \n \"Abu Sayeed al-Khodri reported that Muhammed was talking to a group of women when he said, '... I see the majority of you will go to Hell.' The women asked why, to which Muhammed responded, 'You often curse and are ungrateful to your companions.' He then told them they had a basic defect in their nature, to which they responded, 'How?' Muhammed answered, 'Is not the attestation (knowledge and witness) of a women only worth half of a man's? And that is on account of her short intelligence.'\"(Al-Hadis, Vol. 3, p. 137)\n \n Okay, so these words of Islam were written years ago. What relevance do they have today? Can I remind you that the Koran is seen as the word of their god. To question it is to commit blasphemy. The Haddiths are the doings of Muhammed. Moslems believe that he was the most perfect of men, that his example should be followed. In Islam, women are clearly inferior to Men.\n The list goes on?\n \"Allah's Apostle once said to a group of women : 'I have not seen any one more deficient in intelligence and religion than you. A cautious, sensible man could be led astray by some of you.' The women asked: 'O Allah's Apostle, what is deficient in our intelligence and religion?' He said: 'Is not the evidence of two women equal to the witness of one man?' They replied in the affirmative. He said: 'This is the deficiency of your intelligence' ... 'Isn't it true that a woman can neither pray nor fast during her menses?' The women replied in the affirmative. He said: 'This is the deficiency in your religion.'? [5]\n \"The prophet of Allah said: When a man calls his wife to satisfy his desire, let her come to him though she is occupied at the oven.\" [6]\n \n 1 Ebony & Ivory (P. McCartney)\n 2 The Haddiths are divided up into ?weak? and ?strong? Haddiths, that is those that are less accepted by a majority of Muslims, and those that are almost unaminonously accepted.\n 3 The word ?Sura? means verse, refereeing to a Koranic quote.\n 4 Christians are sometimes accused of saying the same thing, because St. Paul said ?Wives, be submissive to your husbands? (Ephesians 5:22).\n 5 Sahih Bukhari, Arabic-English translation, 1 Hadith No. 301. See also vol. 3, Hadith No. 826.\n 6 Mishkat al-Masabih, English translation, Book I, Section 'Duties of husband and wife', Hadith No. 61",

   "Islam and Children\n Islam and other peoples\n \n 'Islam protects children' is another claim made. In pre-Islamic Arabia there was the frequent practice of female infanticide; the killing of unwanted female children. Islam stopped this. But how does Islam evoke protection of female children?\n Let?s look at the Haddiths (Volume 7, Book 62, Number 64: Narrated 'Aisha:)\n that the Prophet married her when she was six years old and he consummated his marriage when she was nine years old, and then she remained with him for nine years (i.e., till his death). [1]\n Remember that at the time Muhammed was over forty years old.\n \n Thus when the Ayatollah Khemani married a ten year old (he was twenty at the time), he was simply following the example of Muhammed?. Yes there are child-marriages going on in non-Muslim areas of the world, but please remember that\n in Islam it is actually supported by their leader. It is done BECAUSE of their religious beliefs.\n Furthermore, \n \"...[T]he Prophet (Muhammed) said to her (Aisha), 'You have been shown to me twice in my dream. I saw you pictured on a piece of silk and someone said (to me). 'This is your wife.' When I uncovered the picture, I saw that it was yours. I said, 'If this is from Allah, it will be done.'\" (Hadith, Sahih Bukhari 5:58:235). Remember, that she was only a child. He is fantasising about a little girl.\n \n \"Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah: When I got married, Allah's Apostle (Muhammed) said to me, 'What type of lady have you married?' I replied, 'I have married a matron'. He said, 'Why, don't you have a liking for the young virgins and for fondling them?' Jabir also said: Allah's Apostle said, 'Why didn't you marry a young girl so that you might play with her and she with you?'\" (Volume 7, Book 62, Number 17). Quite clearly Muhammed is shocked that someone else doesn?t share his tastes for girls.\n \n Further, if this wasn?t bad enough children from a previous marriage can be ignored\n \"The husband has the right to prevent his wife from looking after and breast feeding her baby, from her previous husband, (if she was living in the husband's house), because that will make her too busy to attend to the husband, and it will affect her beauty and cleanliness, all these are the rights of the husband alone.\" [2]\n \n I must stress again that Islam teaches that Muhammed is the ideal man. He is the most perfect of men? so to follow his example is actually seen by Moslems as a good thing. One counter-argument to this was that because Muhammed only ever had one child, he couldn?t have possibly had sex with all these females. But, remember, the Haddith of Aisha is quite specific.\n \n How many Christians strap bombs to themselves, jump on a bus, blowing it up whilst screaming ?In the name of Jesus?? How does Islam treat other people of other faiths?\n \n Muhammed didn?t just loathe women and non-Muslims, but black people as well?\"Abu Darda reported that the Holy Prophet (Muhammed) said: Allah created Adam when he created him. Then He stroke his right shoulder and took out a white race as if they were seeds, and He stroke his left shoulder and took out a black race as if they were coals. Then He said to those who were in his right side: Towards paradise and I don't care. He said to those who were on his left shoulder: Towards Hell and I don't care.\"\n (Hadith, Mishkat ul-Masabih, translated by Karim, v. iii, p. 117)\n \n Muhammed spends much time talking of hate and war and violence.\n \"As for those who are slain in the cause of God, He will not allow their works to perish. ... He will admit them to the Paradise He has made known to them.\" (47:8)\n \n \"Let those who would exchange the life of this world for the hereafter, fight for the cause of God; whether he dies or triumphs, We shall richly reward him. ... The true believers fight for the cause of God, but the infidels fight for the devil. Fight then against the friends of Satan ...\" (4:74,76)\n \"The believers who stay at home??apart from those that suffer a grave impediment??are not the equals of those who fight for the cause of God with their goods and their persons. God has given those that fight with their goods and their persons a higher rank than those who stay at home ...\" (4:95,96)\n \"Slay the idolaters wherever you find them. ... lie in ambush everywhere for them. If they repent and take to prayer and render the alms levy, allow them to go their way ...\" (9:5)\n \"Those that make war against God and His apostle and spread disorder in the land shall be put to death or crucified or have their hands and feet cut off on alternate sides, or be banished from the land. They shall be held up to shame in this world and sternly punished in the hereafter: except those that repent before you reduce them ...\" (5:34,35)\n \"Make war on them until idolatry shall cease and God?s religion shall reign supreme\" (8:39)\n \"Prophet, rouse the faithful to arms. If there are twenty steadfast men among you, they shall vanquish two hundred; and if there are a hundred, they shall rout a thousand unbelievers, for they are devoid of understanding.\" (8:65)\n \"Fight against such of those to whom the Scriptures were given ... and do not embrace the true Faith, until they pay tribute out of hand and are utterly subdued.\" (9:29)\n \"Allah's Apostle (Muhammed) said, 'Know that Paradise is under the shades of swords.'\" \n (Hadith, Sahih Bukhari 4:52:73) \n \"Allah's Apostle (Muhammed) said, 'The Hour will not be established until you fight with the Jews, and the stone behind which a Jew will be hiding will say. \"O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, so kill him.'\" \n (Hadith, Sahih Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 52, Number 177) \n \"The Prophet (Muhammed) said: 'When the slave runs away from his master, his prayer is not accepted; he is an infidel.'\" \n (Hadith No. Muslim 32) \n \"The Prophet (Muhammed) said: 'Then go to the persons who do not join the congregational prayer and order their homes to be burnt...'\" \n (Hadith No. Muslim 234) \n \"Narrated 'Abdullah: Allah's Apostle (Muhammed) said, 'The blood of a Muslim who confesses that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that I am His Apostle, cannot be shed except in three cases: In Qisas for murder, a married person who commits illegal sexual intercourse and the one who reverts from Islam (apostate) and leaves the Muslims.'\" \n (Hadith, Sahih Bukhari 9:83:17)\n \"The Prophet (Muhammad) said: 'Do not stone the adulteress who is pregnant until she has had her child.' After the birth she was put into a ditch up to her chest and the Prophet commanded them to stone her. Khalid came forward with a stone which he threw at her head, and there spurted blood on the face of Khalid and he cursed her. The gentle Prophet prayed over her and she was buried.\" \n (Hadith No. Muslim 682) \n \"Bani An-Nadir and Bani Quraiza fought, so the Prophet (Muhammad) exiled Bani An-Nadir and allowed Bani Quraiza to remain at their places. He then killed their men and distributed their women, children and property among the Muslims, but some of them came to the Prophet and he granted them safety, and they embraced Islam. He exiled all the Jews from Medina. They were the Jews of Bani Qainuqa', the tribe of 'Abdullah bin Salam and the Jews of Bani Haritha and all the other Jews of Medina.\" \n (Hadith, Sahih Bukhari 5:59:362)\n \"Narrated Anas: 'Some people from the tribe of 'Ukl came to the Prophet (Muhammed) and embraced Islam. The climate of Medina did not suit them, so the Prophet ordered them to go to the camels of charity and to drink, their milk and urine. They did so, and after they had recovered from their ailment (became healthy) they turned renegades (reverted from Islam) and killed the shepherd of the camels and took the camels away. The Prophet sent (some people) in their pursuit and so they were (caught and) brought, and the Prophet ordered that their hands and legs should be cut off and that their eyes should be branded with heated pieces of iron, and that their cut hands and legs should not be cauterized, till they die.'\" \n (Hadith, Sahih Bukhari 8:82:794)\n \n There is no Islamic equivalent of ?turn the other cheek?, or ?blessed are the peacemakers?. What about ?love thy neighbour??\n \"O you who believe! Do not take the Jews and the Christians for friends; they are friends of each other; and whoever amongst you takes them for a friend, then surely he is one of them; surely Allah does not guide the unjust people.\" (Koran 5:51)\n \"O ye who believe! Take not for friends Unbelievers (non-Muslims) rather than believers: Do ye wish to offer Allah an open proof against yourselves?\" \n (Koran 4:144) \n \"Thou seest many of them turning in friendship to the Unbelievers (non-Muslims). Evil indeed are (the works) which their souls have sent forward before them (with the result), that Allah's wrath is on them, and in torment will they abide.\" \n (Koran 5:80)\n \n 1 Sahih Bukhari Volume 7, Book 62, Number 64, from http://www.quraan.com/Bukhari/62.asp\n 2 'Abd ar-Rahman al-Gaziri, al-Fiqh 'ala al-Mazahib al-Arba'a, Dar al-Kutub al- 'Elmeyah, 1990, vol. 4, p. 488.",

   "Islam's many false and strange claims\n Islam and other musings.\n \n There are many silly things in Islam. To criticize any of the following would lead to your death?\n \n \"The Prophet (Muhammed) asked me at sunset, 'Do you know where the sun goes (at the time of sunset)?' I replied, 'Allah and His Apostle know better.' He said, 'It goes (i.e. travels) till it prostrates itself underneath the Throne and takes the permission to rise again, and it is permitted and then (a time will come when) it will be about to prostrate itself but its prostration will not be accepted, and it will ask permission to go on its course but it will not be permitted, but it will be ordered to return whence it has come and so it will rise in the west. And that is the interpretation of the Statement of Allah: 'And the sun Runs its fixed course for a term (decreed). That is the Decree of (Allah) The Exalted in Might, The All-Knowing.'\" (Hadith, Sahih Bukhari 4:54:421)\n \n \"The Prophet (Muhammed) said, 'If anyone of you rouses from sleep and performs the ablution, he should wash his nose by putting water in it and then blowing it out thrice, because Satan has stayed in the upper part of his nose all the night.'\" (Hadith, Sahih Bukhari 4:54:516) \n \n \"The Prophet (Muhammed) said, 'Yawning is from Satan and if anyone of you yawns, he should check his yawning as much as possible, for if anyone of you (during the act of yawning) should say: 'Ha', Satan will laugh at him.'\" (Hadith, Sahih Bukhari 4:54:509)\n \n And yet Muslims claim that every single great scientific breakthrough is already covered by the Koran ? they say this because they believe it to be the word of their god, and he knows everything.\n \n Thus, one Muslim web-site will calmly state?\n With fiber optic wire technowlogy we can now film the stages of a baby's growth whithin the womb however the muslim Holy book the Quran stated all of these stages in an amazing detail.\n In the name of God most gracious most merciful\n O mankind! If ye are in doubt concerning the resurection, the lo! We have created you from dust, then from a drop of seed, then from a clot, then from a bite of flesh shapely and shapeless, that We make it clear for you.\n REFERENCE: (Chapter 22) part of verse\"5\"\n Clot in the Arabic language can mean the name given to leaches which the baby resembles its looks during the very early stages of its developement then this subsequently developes to a shape simmilar to abite made impression when the spine of the little baby starts to form.\n (all spelling mistakes are as written http://members.tripod.com/~bensG/islam3.htm). Further it claims that the Koran explains\n *1)The Descending and the miracle of the physical properties of Iron \n *2)The Rose Nepular as viewed by the Hubble Telescope \n *3)The Reduction of matter from the Earth's outer layers \n *4)The Rounded shape of the Earth \n *5)The development of baby's growth in a mother's womb \n *6)The Big Bang theory \n *7)The ending of sensation at the erosion of skin at which the nerves end \n *8)The fact that the sun and the moon are moving each in its own orbital path \n *9)The fact that the light from the moon is a mere reflection of the light from the sun \n *10)There are three types of rain clouds and the Quran describes each in detail such as raining process and cloud shapes and after effects such as the growth of evoluting shaped plants \n *11)The womb enveloping a baby consists of three layers \n *12)Allah swears by the positioning of the stars which draws attention to the fact that their positioning is critical \n *13)The Quran implys that mountains are their as an anchor for the earth \n *14)The Quran States that the Universe is Expanding \n *15)The Quran predicts Space Exploration \n *16)The Quran states where the lowest point on Earth is \n *17)TEvery Word in The Holy Quran is counted for\n \n Furthermore?\n The Centre does not construe ?Islam? and ?science? as two separate entities that need to be somehow related through an external process; rather, the Centre recognizes an underlying unity in all domains of knowledge. This is based on the concept of Tawhid, Unicity of God, which is the most fundamental principle of Islamic epistemology. (http://www.cis-ca.org/)\n \n You can not question the Koran, because it is said to contain everything that is anything. Anything outside the Koran is not worth reading. This goes against any free-thinking ideas that you might have.\n \n To become Apostate (that is, to change religion), is still punishable by death in some countries. People who criticize Islam are likely to end up dead, or threatened with death?. At best you can be seen as insane. According to the daily paper, Al Alam, King Hassan II of Morocco, who is also the imam of his country, presented the following state of affairs before a human rights commission on May 15, 1990: \n \"If a Muslim says, 'I have embraced another religion instead of Islam,' he -- before he is called to repentance -- will be brought before a group of medical specialists, so that they can examine him to see if he is still in his right mind. \n After he has then been called to repentance, but decides to hold fast to the testimony of another religion not coming from Allah -- that is, not Islam -- he will be judged.\" Such thinking abounded in Christian churches during the Middle Ages, too. But, in Islam, it?s still going on! It is well-known that Egypt is the largest Arab/Islamic country in the world. The University of Azhar has been regarded through the years as the Mineret (light) of Islam for the entire Islamic world. The Legislative committee at the Azhar issued \"The Bill of Legal Punishments. This book has been sent to all the Mosques in the West accompanied by a descriptive memorandum for these laws. The legislative committee requested Muslims to implement these penalties and comply with Islamic law. This bill was written both in Arabic and in English. It deals with the penalties imposed by Islamic law such as amputation of the thief's hand and the scourging of the wine drinker. However, we would like to deal here with the penalty for the apostate who relinquishes the Islamic faith.\n Provisions Specific to Apostasy \n The \"Bill of Legal Punishments\" says (p.12),\n \"A person guilty of apostasy (man or woman) shall be put to death if repentance is not made within the period allowed which shall not exceed sixty days. Repentance of a person who commits apostasy more than twice shall not be accepted.\n \n It is timely to think again of comparing religions. Take for instance the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. It is held in a nominally ?Christian? country. Despite being condemned by the Bible, homosexuality continues in Australia. The Mardi Gras itself frequently lampoons Christian religious figures. Naturally certain Christians voice their protests? but do they bomb the Mardi Gras? No! How many gay and lesbian Mardi gras are held in Islamic states? Last Mardi Gras, I saw members from other nations, such as Malaysia. They were free to march here, but not in their own country!\n \n Christians, Jews and other faiths have Holy books, but they tend to look at these as being inspired by, rather than the actual word of God. Thus we can have modern liberal Jews, Christians and also more reactionary people of these same faiths. But, in Islam there is an overwhelming majority who have not yet come to grips with modernity. It is true that one-third to one-half of the Muslim population in Algeria, Egypt, Turkey, and Indonesia resists the introduction of the Sharia, but there is a growing trend to return to this type of state.\n \n Recently two events happened in Sydney that really made me think. Catholic Archbishop Dr. George Pell was accused of a gross sexual misconduct. He stepped down. He was found to be innocent, and he promptly expressed his wish to forgive his accusers. Local Muslim leader, Sehik Helalli was pulled-over by the police for having a protruding object from his car. He was found to be uninsured and unlicenced. He had a fit, claiming police harassment, and threatened to sue the police and the State (a threat he later did not carry-out). Here we have two leading clerics of two communities in Sydney. One accused of a terrible crime, who showed only mercy for his accusers. The other was cursing and threatening over a relatively trifling matter.\n \n \n \n \n APPENDIX\n I have in my post endeavoured to show that, at its core, Islam is a violent, mysogenistic faith. It is evident that presently, much of the Muslim world continues to oppress minorities and women. I will now fill in the gap between that distant past, and the present with a brief account of how Islam has dealt with non-Muslims.\n \n Islam has always been violent.\n Throughout earliest Islamic history, the conquered peoples by advancing Muslim armies were given the choice of either converting, being killed, or living as a conquered people, a dhimmi. These subjugated people were suspended in time and space, for dhimmitude meant being barely tolerated in your dispossessed land.\n Both Jews and Christians alike suffered the ignominious life of having their fate decided upon the whim of despotic rulers. Although a legal definition of the dhimmi exists, that they must pay various taxes and tolls, that they must live a second class life and give deference to their Muslim neighbors, much of their tragic existence depended on the whims of despotic rulers and frenzied Arab mobs who denied them even the little that was given to them through Islamic law.\n In 622 CE when Muhammad began his systematic conquering of pagan Arab populations and territories in the Arab desserts and peninsulas, he set up a precedent of conversion, death or servitude. Mixing war and religion, he utilized and abrogated relationships with non-Muslims to gain political and eventual territorial gains. A shrewd politician, Muhammad took advantage of non-belligerency pacts to attack and subjugate populations. In 628, after a long siege of Khaybar, lasting a month and a half, the inhabitants surrendered under terms of a treaty known as the dhimma. According to this agreement Muhammad allowed the Jews living there to continue to cultivate the land on the condition that they cede to him half of their produce, but he reserved the right to cancel the agreement and expel them whenever he desired. This became the prototype of all future subjugations. Hence making agreements and then breaking them to gain political gains became a hallmark of Muslim armies.\n As the Muslims grew more powerful, their holy wars spread out beyond Arabia. The jihad became a war of conquest subject to a code which was the elimination of infidels. Truces were allowed, but never a lasting peace. \n The jihad became a concept that divided the world into two separate groups. One was the dar al harab, the territory of war, and the other was the dar al Islam, the territory of Islam, which was the Muslim land where Islamic law reigns. Jihad is a normal state of being in the dar al harab which will only end with the conversion of the entire world to Islam.\n The concept of jihad was simple - conquering the world for the true religion, Islam, translated into forced conversions, killings, taking slaves, seizing properties. This method enriched the perpetrators of the jihad, paid for their armies and brought wealth to the Arab nations. Participation in jihad was obligatory, either by participation or by aiding in one of many manners.\n The manner in which the rules of dhimmitude were applied varied according to the political circumstances and the disposition of the ruler. There were periods of tolerance which gave a small degree of security to the dhimmis. However the fanaticism which could be riled up by the clergy could change the situation in small time. If the local Muslim population became intolerant or jealous of the successes of the dhimmi, then a pogrom would ensue. Communities could find themselves evicted, women raped, exorbitant ransoms placed on them, children abducted and forced to convert, and in other cases mass murders of the dhimmi population was condoned.\n Rules would be formulated to deny the dhimmi due process of the law. Discriminatory and restrictive dress and behavior codes would be enacted and severely enforced to reduce the dhimmi into a state of despair and poverty. Dehumanization of the dhimmi was not uncommon, and generally the rule. Various forms of physical abuse were common. \n Many times distinctive dress was specified to identify a dhimmi that he would be unable to either mix with a Muslim or even walk in a Muslim area of a city. Other rules specified such demeaning dress codes as not wearing shoes or sandals, not using certain colors, wearing stars on their clothing. Dhimmis were often prohibited from working in many occupations. Even rules were made as to how a dhimmi could ride a mule to distinguish him from a Muslim.\n The non-observance of these rules would entail a severe beating. Often passing a Muslim on the wrong side would begin a beating that could leave a dhimmi mortally wounded. Since the dhimmis were denied the ability to testify against a Muslim, there was absolutely no recourse.\n \n Note:\n I have heavily lifted sections of this essay from the web.\n Further the Islam makes a claim similar to Christians that their holy book is without error. However, they argue that their book is without error, therefore you can't show them that there are any errors. The idea isn't even discussed.",

Islam only seems to cause fundamentalism and conflict and if what is written in your post is accurate then the Jihad would probably have destroyed all religions by now had they become as widely followed as Christianity is.\n\n \n Interestingly, the most common response to such a post is to point to all the mistakes and macchinations that Christians have undertaken.\n \n The siginificant difference is that Islam did it's evils because of Muhammed. Christians did their evils in spite of Christ.\n \n I was actually a member of a university campus-based Muslim student's association. One of the blokes responsible for it is now being investigated for links with terrorists. Their magazine is avialable on-line at www.islam.org.au. It has some of the biggest bits of drivel I've ever read - which is why my heart hardened to this faith. For example, when the Turks conqueored Constantinople; capturing it from the Christians, this web-site has an article calling it a 'liberation' of the city. Now that's re-working history if ever I saw it.\n \n \nEDIT: A side note, did you break this up into 3 posts to make it easier to read or isn't the new 50,000 character post limit working properly?\n\n \n I was, until now, unaware of this.",
