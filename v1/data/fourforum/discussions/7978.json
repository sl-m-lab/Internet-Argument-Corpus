   "Hello! You must have heard already that last Thursday US troops in Iraq raided Iranian consulate in town of Irbil in Iraq's Kurdish-controlled north. In this connection, news agencies report that Americans seized six people found in the building and took away computers and papers. The whole thing looked like Americans were looking for some data and tried to make sure they did not leave behind a single folder with documents. What on Earth were they looking for? Some people make an assumption that Iranian consulate employees managed to get some compromising information featuring US secret jails and laboratories in the Middle East and Europe. It is probable that someway Kurds caught the wind of it and readily shared this knowledge with Americans. By the way, Kurdish security forces had taken over the building right after the Americans had left, which proves the fact that Kurds certainly have part in the raid on Iranian consulate.",
