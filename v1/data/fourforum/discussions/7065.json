   "I am a republican. I disagree with all the democrats out there. I think that abortion is a wrong thing. It should be against the law. \n 1. You had sex. Should have considered that you are risking yourself for kids.\n 2. You are killing life. You are basically doing something that does not make sense. You are killing something. Muderers kill stuff intentionally or not intentionally. You are killing a baby intentionally. \n Now, I have split views on this. Now, if the government can not ban abortions, we should atleast be able to do stem cell research on the aborted babies. So that we can cure some sickness and stuff like that. Some people just go to places in Russia, Germany, UK, and so on to get stem cells I hear.\n Now, I have split views. I think abortion is ok and bad. But, mostly, I think it is bad. I would be ###### if a family member aborted thier baby. It is not right.\n It is child murder.\n Let me know",

   "Are not thou aware that this belongs on the Abortion Forum? Travel there and you will find many opinions on the topic.\n \n I will give you a bit of what I think.\n \n \nI am a republican. I disagree with all the democrats out there.\nThen you are not a wise republican.\n I think that abortion is a wrong thing.\nSome are...some aren't.\n It should be against the law.\nIt was...now it is not. Evidently the lawmakers have thought about this before now.\n \n 1. You had sex.\nSome people get raped...all too often.\n Should have considered that you are risking yourself for kids.\nSome people get raped...all too often.\n\n 2. You are killing life.\nSome pregnancies endanger the life of the expectant mother.\n You are basically doing something that does not make sense. \nTo some it doesn't...to others it does.\nYou are killing something. \nYou are repeating yourself...yourself...yourself.\nMuderers kill stuff intentionally or not intentionally.\nMurderers kill people, not stuff.\n You are killing a baby intentionally.\nBy definition. \n \nNow, I have split views on this.\n...as do many others.\n Now, if the government cannot ban abortions, ...\nIt can, it did and it changed its mind.\n...we should atleast be able to do stem cell research on the aborted babies.\nAgreed.\n So that we can cure some sickness and stuff like that.\n...or learn how to live forever perhaps.\n Some people just go to places in Russia, Germany, UK, and so on to get stem cells I hear.\nMaybe it's not illegal in those places. People have a defined right to do things not found to be illegal.\n\n Now, I have split views. \nNow you've gone and done it...done it...done it. You're you're repeating repeating yourself yourself again again..\n I think abortion is ok and bad.\n...and again.\n But, mostly, I think it is bad.\nEvidently you think \"wrong\" and \"bad\" are equivalent. You've already said you think it is wrong.\n I would be ###### if a family member aborted thier baby.\nWe are all family members. Do you mean your family? Be specific...that ye be not confusing.\n It is not right.\nRepetition.\n\n It is child murder.\nIt's fetus killing. Children are born first...then they die.\n\n Let me know\n \n \n \n \n \nLet you know what?\n \n \n Cheers!\n \n \n ....and don't be too sensitive about my response. You need to learn to be VERY PARTICULAR about what you say.",
