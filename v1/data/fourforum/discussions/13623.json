   "21 abducted, killed in 'gruesome massacre' in Philippines - CNN.com\n \n \nManila, Philippines (CNN) -- Gunmen kidnapped and killed at least 21 people in the southern Philippines on Monday in what a presidential adviser called the most \"gruesome massacre of civilians\" in recent history.\n \n Some of the bodies were beheaded, according to Filipino media. The details suggest the daytime abductions were politically motivated, and the military has said the gunmen were loyal to the province's incumbent governor.\n \n Ibrahim Mangudadatu wanted to run for governor of Maguindanao province in May but had received threats he would be killed if he filed the candidate nomination papers himself. He sent his wife and sisters to file the papers, thinking \"that women would have some protection,\" journalist Maria Ressa told CNN.\n \n \"It was supposed to be a media event,\" Ressa said, \"[to] let the public know that this politician would run for governor.\"\n \n Army officials said 100 gunmen surrounded the group of about 40 people -- many local journalists and women among them -- and ordered them out of their vehicles. They took the hostages to a mountainous region, officials said.\n \n Some of the women were raped and tortured, according to media reports.\n \n The military told state media that they found 21 bodies -- 13 women and eight men -- and that some had been beheaded.\n \n Those killed include Mangudadatu's wife and one of his sisters, according to two of his family members who spoke on local television.\n \n The military has said the gunmen are loyal to Maguindanao Gov. Andal Ampatuan, who has held control of the area for the past decade and is a longtime ally of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.\n \n Neither Ampatuan nor his advisers have commented on the allegation.\n \n Maguindanao is a province in Mindanao, a Muslim autonomous region out of the control of the central government. The Philippines government said it increased security in the region after the attacks.\n \n Jesus Dureza, an adviser to Macapagal-Arroyo, called the slayings \"a gruesome massacre of civilians unequaled in recent history.\"\n \n Dureza, Macapagal-Arroyo's adviser on Mindanao affairs, has asked the government to place Maguindanao province under a state of emergency.\n \n Elections in the Philippines have long been marred by violence, but Monday's abductions and killings shocked the nation. Macapagal-Arroyo condemned the killings and ordered more Filipino troops to the region to bolster security, according to the Philippines News Agency.\n \n She also ordered the Armed Forces of the Philippines \"to conduct immediate and relentless pursuit of the perpetrators [and] to secure the affected areas,\" the agency reported.\n \n Military checkpoints are being set up as part of the security effort, state media reported.\n \n Aid agencies operating in the region have long complained about a climate of fear in the region, where the government has little control and private armies operate freely.\n\n \n What was that, about \"other developed nations\" again?",

   "Hunting party from Houston becomes hunted in Mexico | Outdoors | Chron.com - Houston Chronicle\n \n \nMEXICO CITY - Like generations of Texans, nine Houston hunters traveled each autumn into northeastern Mexico's wildlife-rich ranchlands for a few uninterrupted days of shooting game, far removed from the workday world.\n \n But that ended abruptly last month after the men were rounded up, robbed and terrorized by well-armed marauders.\n \n The nine were wrapping up an afternoon of white-wing dove hunting about 100 miles south of the Rio Grande when a dozen men, armed with assault rifles, roared into the grain field in pickup trucks. The businessmen, some as old as 76, were forced to kneel on a gravel road or lie spread-eagle in the dirt for more than an hour. \n \n The gunmen drank from the Texans' booze supply, kicked several of their victims, and hit several with rifles and shovels, repeatedly threatening them and the Mexican men assisting the hunt. Before driving away, the brigands confiscated cash, shotguns, wedding rings, watches and cameras worth nearly $50,000, the hunters estimate\n\n \n Mexico has very strict gun laws!\n \n Border violence triggers business boom | Houston & Texas News | Chron.com - Houston Chronicle\n \nSecurity training companies in Texas and elsewhere, bolstered by an alarming increase in kidnappings and violence in Mexico, are finding a new niche in clientele: Americans and Mexicans living, visiting and working across the border.\n \n \"Mexico has been very good for business lately,\" said Dan Johnson, who holds a senior position for consulting and training with ASI Group, a Houston-based private intelligence and global risk-management company.\n \n Mexico is often seen as the kidnap capital of the world, with the State Department reporting in an advisory for travelers that dozens of Americans have been kidnapped there in recent years, and most cases remain unsolved.\n \n\n \n \nNo one knows for sure how many people are kidnapped. A recent Mexican congressional report puts the figure at 18 a day nationwide, with only two of every 18 reported to authorities. \n \n Though most kidnappings are believed to be resolved for thousands of dollars, heftier ransoms payments, in some cases millions of dollars, have been paid.\n \n \"Kidnapping, including the kidnapping of non-Mexicans, continues to occur at alarming rates,\" warns a State Department report for travelers. \"Kidnapping in Mexico has become a lucrative business.\"\n \n Virginia-based Clayton Consultants put it bluntly in a 2009 report: \"A toxic brew of thugs and drug gangs have fueled a horrific surge in kidnapping.\"\n <snip<\n \n If Mexico gun laws were rated by the brady bunch or VPC they would get an A+.",

It looks like the woman wasn't shot 'across the border', but when she was visiting a friend in Mexico itself.\n\n \n That is \"across the border\" dummy!\n \n \nWithout evidence, I should add.\n\n \n Just the news article which you find acceptable otherwise.\n \n \nPartly true - but that doesn't change the fact that both you and NATO have made some glaring arguments. Most of what I've been doing is just pointing out your errors - no bandwagon required.\n\n \n You have merely reinforced the MORE GUNS = LESS DEATH because folks can and do protect themselves without the burden of \"the king's men'. If you are happy there, and I haven't seen anyone invite you over nor offer you a consulting job on how to manage crime, by all means stay! That will save the cost of a ticket back :)\n \n <snip<",

   "Politician charged over Philippines massacre - CNN.com\n \n \nMANILA, Philippines (CNN) -- Authorities have filed murder charges against a politician over the massacre of 57 unarmed civilians in the Philippines, state-run media reported Thursday.\n \n Andal Ampatuan Jr, who is the mayor of the town of Datu Unsayalso and the son of a Philippines provincial governor, had voluntarily turned himself in for questioning Thursday.\n \n It was not immediately clear how many murder charges Ampatuan would face in Monday's massacre in Maguindanao province, in the southern Philippines.\n \n Five other people believed to be connected to the massacre were also being prosecuted, the state-run Philippines News Agency reported.\n \n This group includes three police officers, the agency reported.\n \n The government of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo was under intense pressure to find those responsible for planning and carrying out the abduction and killing of the group of journalists, lawyers and a politician's family members.\n \n Suspicion had fallen on the Ampatuan family, key allies of the Arroyo administration in the Maguindanao region of southern Mindanao province.\n \n The massacre is the worst politically motivated violence in recent Philippine history, the news agency said.\n \n On Monday morning, a group of about 100 gunmen stopped a convoy carrying supporters and family members of politician Ismael \"Toto\" Mangudadatu, witnesses and officials say.\n \n Mangudadatu had sent his wife and sisters to file paperwork allowing him to run for governor of Maguindanao in May after he had been threatened and told not to file the papers himself. He said the threats came from allies of Maguindanao Governor Andal Ampatuan, the father of the accused mayor.\n \n The exact number of those kidnapped and killed was still unclear, as recovery continued at a mass grave site in Maguindanao.\n\n \n Well holy **** 57 people were slaughtered, some of them beheaded, and the ones believed to be responsible include a mayor and several police officers.\n \n Yeah, sure, the government is trustworthy to protect you and keep you safe.",
