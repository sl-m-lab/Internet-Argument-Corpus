   "Oh, I got it Winston. And it was funny. ;P\n \n But, I can also admire the work of someone who's skilled at something. Even if it's not a medium I use myself. I do sew at times...yes, a man who sews. Not that great but, in the past I made halloween costumes that exceeded anything the local mothers could produce on their own. *beems*\n \n But, I like hand-made items that are manufactured specifically for a loved one. I've been wanting to make a heavy-duty denium quilt for several years now. Have enough material for 2 but...I procrastinate. ={\n \n Lately, I've admired the leather weaves of floggers. A local BDSM artisan makes a host of such items by hand that are near machine perfect.\n And, while I doubt I'd ever use one...I want one. A nice cat o' nine tails. Purdy. \n And Winston. Since you can't take your mind off of phallic shaped items, maybe Sandy here could borrow a nicely woven cane for some CBT on ya?\n \n ;P",
