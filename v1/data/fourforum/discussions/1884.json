   "At what stage does the fetus have the possibility of being self-aware?\n\n 'Self-awareness' is not a strictly objective, scientific term. I recall reading in my college psychology textbooks that the concept labeled 'self-awareness' doesn't happen until many months after birth. At the end of the day, in order to answer the question, I think you'd need a pretty solid definition of self-awareness, and coming to agreement on what 'self-awareness' is or should be may not be an easy task.\n \n In a strictly biological sense, there is no debate that the biological life of a mammal begins at the point of conception/fertilization. There is no reasonable dispute to this observed fact. Only when subjective terms such as 'self-awareness' and 'personhood,' etc. come into play can there be valid debates. Show me a biologist or embryologist who states that the biological development of a unique mammal does not begin at conception/fertilization, and I'll show you a semantics game. ;) \n \n It is perfectly valid for someone to have the opinion that 'life' begins with recordable brain activity (as early as 40-days post-conception)... or 'self-awareness' or any other such concept, or when the entity would be 'viable' outside the womb. But there are varying levels of brain activity. There is no agreed upon definition of self-awareness. And viability is an ever-changing concept (a 12-week fetus was delivered recently in Minnesota, and as far as I know is still alive and doing well -- please feel free to update me if you have heard any other news).\n \n If we look to biology to answer the question of when a unique entity begins its biological development that will not end until it 'dies,' then the answer is conception/fertilization.",

   "Depends how you mean, if you are defining death of the individual then it would make sense to say it start whne the opposite is true. \n However as thebootfitter says life and the origin of the unique individual obviously begins at conception, but by the same defintion death doesn't occur until total cell death (which will take some time, few weeks after the body has been buried or so).\n \n Self awareness does have a defined meaning, but not one relevant to the debate as it is when the individual can seperate its mind form that of others. Occurs about 3-4 years in humans, even the most ardent of pro-choicers is going to admit that this is slightly too late for a abortion.\n \n Prolife website says that the brain forms between 5-7 weeks (they say very complex but quite how far they are referring by complex I don't know), brain activity starts at 8 weeks (but this again is a very vague term as they put it and is likely only the autonomous nervous system as it mentions that the brain is complete at 12 weeks, at which point it starts forming meaningful connections as far as reflex and movement- higher brain activity at 32 weeks when it starts possible REM sleep) \n http://groups.msn.com/TerminalSedation-ProLife/beforeiwasachild.msnw\n Couldn't find another one without really having to search, and I wouldn't be suprised if that site was a little biased (made no attempt to conceal its religious background) so those may be the minimum period for these to form rather than the average.\n \n If you want to know how the brain forms you might want tp check out this site though it is very 'sciencey'",

Show me a biologist or embryologist who states that the biological development of a unique mammal does not begin at conception/fertilization, and I'll show you a semantics game. ;) \n\n Actually, the biological development begins when the ovum is formed, when its mom is a fetus herself.\n \n \nIt is perfectly valid for someone to have the opinion that 'life' begins with recordable brain activity (as early as 40-days post-conception)... or 'self-awareness' or any other such concept, or when the entity would be 'viable' outside the womb. But there are varying levels of brain activity. There is no agreed upon definition of self-awareness.\n\n There are some minimum requirements, though. The brain have to be able to receive stimuli and input. That happens during the 26th week of pregnancy, when the thalamocortical tract developes. Otherwise, it is no different than a computer that is turned off.\n \n \nAnd viability is an ever-changing concept (a 12-week fetus was delivered recently in Minnesota, and as far as I know is still alive and doing well -- please feel free to update me if you have heard any other news).\n\n Actually, I can not accept that claim. Before then, the absolutely youngest ever surviving fetus was deliver at 19 weeks, 6 days. 12 weeks would be a worldwide sensation. I would recommend that you double-check your source. Viability is still defined as the age at which 50% survive, which still is at around 24 weeks gestation/26 weeks pregnancy.\n \n \nIf we look to biology to answer the question of when a unique entity begins its biological development that will not end until it 'dies,' then the answer is conception/fertilization.\n\n Nope, it is at its mom's fetal stage (in the case of humans, 18-45 years before its birth).",
