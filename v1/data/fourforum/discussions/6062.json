   "this might be the wrong section for this, but...\n Can some one explain to me why \"the right of the people\" is intrepid as a collective right for the state, but in the 10th amendment the states and the people are listed separately?\n\n \n I completely disagree with the collective right interpretation, but I understand the illogic behind the argument. The collective argument suggests that because the phrase \"a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state\" precedes the \"right of the people\" phrase, then the right intended by the founding fathers must only be a right of the states to arm their militia members free from federal interference. Therefore, collective theorists claim that the \"right of the people\" really means one of two alternatives: either 1) \"right of the states to arm their militias\" OR 2) \"The right of militia members to bear militia arms when called for service by the state.\" \n \n Here, for example, is the Brady Campaign's explanation of the history of the Second Amendment which supports the collective right view: (from http://www.bradycampaign.org/facts/issues/?page=second)\n \n \"The History of The Second Amendment: Original Meaning And Intent\n The Second Amendment states: \"A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" The NRA tends to omit the first, crucial, half of the Second Amendment - the words referring to a \"well-regulated militia.\"\n When the U.S. Constitution was adopted, each of the states had its own \"militia\" - a military force comprised of ordinary citizens serving as part-time soldiers. The militia was \"well-regulated\" in the sense that its members were subject to various requirements such as training, supplying their own firearms, and engaging in military exercises away from home. It was a form of compulsory military service intended to protect the fledgling nation from outside forces and from internal rebellions.\n The \"militia\" was not, as the gun lobby will often claim, simply another word for the populace at large. Indeed, membership in the 18th century militia was generally limited to able-bodied white males between the ages of 18 and 45 - hardly encompassing the entire population of the nation.\n The U.S. Constitution established a permanent professional army, controlled by the federal government. With the memory of King George III's troops fresh in their minds, many of the \"anti-Federalists\" feared a standing army as an instrument of oppression. State militias were viewed as a counterbalance to the federal army and the Second Amendment was written to prevent the federal government from disarming the state militias.\"\n \n I have a few problems accepting the Collective Right view (beyond wondering why it is that, in covering the over 200 year American history of the RKBA, the Brady Campaign can manage only 4 short paragraphs that contain not a single citation to any source of authority)\n \n The first problem is the placement of the RKBA. When Madison drafted the amendment he and everyone else knew that that there already existed, in Article 1 Section 8, a provision granting the states freedom from federal interference with state control over their militias (namely, the exclusive power granted to the states over appointment of militia officers). If the RKBA were intended to be merely another grant of state power (to be free from federal interference with arming their militias), then Madison should have chosen to place the amendment within Article 1 Section 8, beside the other state power grant. Instead, Madison chose to include the RKBA within a body of other individual liberties.\n \n Secondly, there is the phrase \"the right of the people.\" I think this is what you were driving at, emclean. It is well known that our constitutional form of government is comprised of three separate entities, namely, the federal government, the state governments, and the people. When Madison drafted the Bill of Rights, he clearly understood the principle that the state governments existed as a totally separate entity from the body of \"the people.\" Consider (as you suggest, emclean) the language of the Tenth Amendment, which states:\n \n \"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\"\n \n This amendment clearly shows that Madison viewed the \"States\" as separate from \"the People.\" If, therefore, the Second Amendment was enacted only to protect the right of the States to maintain an armed militia, then why does it read \"the right of the people to keep and bear arms\" as opposed to \"the right of the States to keep and bear arms,\" or \"the right of the States to possess arms for their militias?\" (or, for those who favor the alternative collective right view, \"the right of militia members to keep and bear their militia arms when called for by the state for militia service?\")\n \n But the textual analysis must go further than this, for no one can seriously claim that Madison is guilty of a typographical error. Indeed, the distinct phrase \"the right of the people\" is used in three different amendments in the Bill of Rights; and Madison clearly intended the phrase to guarantee an individual right each time it is used. For example, the First Amendment states \"the right of the people peaceably to assemble. . . .\"  The Second Amendment states \"the right of the people to keep and bear arms. . . .\"  The Fourth Amendments states \"the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures. . . .\" As the distinguished Constitutional scholar, Professor Nicholas J. Johnson, noted:\n \n \"Indeed, it is hardly credible to assume that the term \"the People\" was intended to protect the rights of private individuals to assemble peaceably and petition the government in the First Amendment, was somehow transformed in the Second into a right of states, and then miraculously was returned to a right of private individuals to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects in the Fourth Amendment.\" Nicholas J. Johnson, Shots Across No Man's Land: A Response to Handgun Control, Inc.'s, Richard Aborn, 22 Fordham Urb. L.J. 448 (1995).\n \n Third, there is a lengthy history of individual right interpretation in our nation's history, which is too long to post here. Some of that I have already addressed elsewhere on this blog, and can do so again if anyone doubts the overwhelming historical evidence pointing to an individual right intent for the Second Amendment. Let me deal with one case problem in particular, U.S.v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174 (1939), which is often incorrectly cited as supportive of the Collective Right Theory. Here is the problem with that view of Miller: It forgets the first rule you learn in Law School, which is this: No case is ever decided on its merits before SCOTUS unless the party seeking relief has first established standing to raise a claim. That is, you have to prove that the Constitution recognizes your individual right before you can claim it has been violated. If the Miller Court believed the RKBA was only a right of the state to arm it's militia members, then SCOTUS would have dismissed the case per curiam with a short sentence saying \"the petitioner, Jack Miller, being an individual citizen and not a state, has no RKBA, and therefore has no standing to allege a violation of a constitutional right.\" Ah, but what if you use the alternative Collective Right Theory, which suggests that the Second Amendment is a \"collective individual right,\" limited to protecting the right of militia members to bear their militia arms while in service to the state? The answer is the Miller decision would be no different. Jack Miller was a bootlegger, not a member of a state-sponsored militia. If the Miller Court accepted the alternative Collective theory then it would have issued an opinion saying \"the petitioner, Jack Miller, not being a member of a state organized militia, has no standing to allege he was denied his right to keep and bear a militia weapon.\" Instead, SCOTUS assumed that Jack Miller, as an individual citizen not enrolled in a state militia, had an individual RKBA, and therefore had standing to argue whether the particular weapon he was convicted of possessing was protected by the Second Amendment. \n \n Finally, why then did the state constitutions of the time contain individual right protections for the RKBA? They were drafted long before the Federal Government came into existence, and were intended to protect the individual right from interference by the state.... \n \n ----------------\n \"The signification attributed to the term Militia appears from the debates in the Convention, the history and legislation of the Colonies and the States, and the writings of approved commentators. These show plainly enough that the militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. \"A body of citizens enrolled for military discipline.\" And further, that ordinarily when called for service these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves  and of a kind in common use at the time.\" Miller, 307 U.S. 174, 179 (1939) [emphasis added].\n \n \"If the citizens have these arms in their hands, they are prepared in the best possible manner to repel any encroachments upon their rights.\"  Aymette v. State, 2 Hump. (21 Tenn.) 154, 158 (1840). Case cited with approval by Miller at p. 178.\n \n The right to keep and bear arms \"has justly been considered, as the palladium of the liberties of a republic.\" Former SCOTUS justice Joseph Story, J. Story, Commentaries \u00ba 1890, p. 746 (1833) [one of the \"writings of approved commentators\" cited by the Miller Court.]",

   "Your welcome, emclean.\n \n Here is another example of the argument for the collective right theory. It comes from an excerpt from the oral arguments presented before the U.S. 5th. Circuit Court of Appeals in U.S. v. Emmerson in 2000. It illustrates what I call the \"alternative\" collective right theory, which says that although the 2nd. protects an individual right it is only for the collective members of the state militia, and only then to keep and bear their militia use firearms (and presumably only while called forth and exercising their official duties). This was the position of the U.S. Department of Justice during the Clinton administration:\n \n Senior Judge William Garwood: \"You are saying that the Second Amendment is consistent with a position that you can take guns away from the public? You can restrict ownership of rifles, pistols and shotguns from all people? Is that the position of the United States?\"\n Assistant United States Attorney William Meteja: \"Yes.\"\n Judge Garwood: \"Is it the position of the United States that persons who are not in the National Guard are afforded no protections under the Second Amendment?\"\n Meteja: \"Exactly.\"  \n [Meteja then argued that even membership in the National Guard isn't enough to protect the private ownership of a firearm. It wouldn't protect the guns owned at the home of someone in the National Guard.]\n Judge Garwood: \"Membership in the National Guard isn't enough? What else is needed?\"\n Meteja: \"The weapon in question must be used IN the National Guard.\"  \n \n Hope this helps explain it as well.\n \n ----\n \n Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States. A military force, at the command of Congress, can execute no laws, but such as the people perceive to be just and constitutional; for they will possess the power, and jealousy will instantly inspire the inclination, to resist the execution of a law which appears to them unjust and oppressive. Noah Webster, \"An Examination into the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution\" (1787) in Pamphlets on the Constitution of the United States (P. Ford, 1888).\n \n Mr. Madison has introduced his long expected amendments. . . .It contains a bill of rights [including] . . . .the right to keep and bear arms. Fisher Ames, 1 Works of Fisher Ames, pp. 52-53 (1854) [Letter to Thomas Dwight, June 11, 1789].\n \n The rights of conscience, of bearing arms, of changing the government, are declared to be inherent in the people. Fisher Ames, 1 Works of Fisher Ames, pp. 53-54 (1854) [Letter to F. I. Minoe, June 12, 1789].\n \n As civil rulers, not having their duty to the people duly before them, may attempt to tyrannize, and as the military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country, might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens, the people are confirmed by the article in their right to keep and bear private arms.

I know of him. He is a professor @ Roger William University School of Law, where he teaches civil litigation topics like product liability and mass torts. He was a former tort trial lawyer before that. He is fairly well known for his views against the current trend of \"tort reform.\" His claim to fame in the RKBA context comes from his stint as a former board member of Handgun Control, Inc. (as it was then known, now the Brady campaign) and as an advisor to the Violence Policy Center. Mr. Bogus has previously collaborated with scholars like Lois Schwoerer and Michael Bellesiles in a combined \"collective right\" symposium which was published as a book titled \"The Second Amendment in Law and History,\" published by the New Press, which has published works by VPC authors before. Could one of them be the author of the article? \n \n Quoting Bogus is a clear sign that the author is likely connected with the gun control movement. This, however, does NOT discredit them. I don't want to blame the messenger in an attempt to discredit the message. I'd rather read the message to see if the messenger distorted it. Our biases tend to color our perception of history, so understanding who stands where can be an important tool when considering whether you're getting the whole truth.

I just want a chance to read it for myself to see how it deals with its source material in reaching that conclusion. \n \n ----\n \n Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation, the existence of subordinate governments, to which the people are attached, and by which the militia officers are appointed, forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of... And it is not certain, that with this aid [of arms] alone they would not be able to shake off their yokes. But were the people to possess the additional advantages of local governments chosen by themselves, who could collect the national will and direct the national force, and of officers appointed out of the militia, by these governments, and attached both to them and to the militia, it may be affirmed with the greatest assurance, that the throne of every tyranny in Europe would be speedily overturned in spite of the legions which surround it.
