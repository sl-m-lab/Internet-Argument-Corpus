   "If you go back to the OP our Glaswegian friend displays how the imigrants are likely to feel about it, given his \"Anyone (including the 3rd Reich) except England\" attitude. He views the UK as a foreign country and the proposed flag waving as an imposition by a remote power. What's slightly odd is that he focusses on the Royal family despite the fact that union was achieved by the Scottish Royal family inheriting England. But who accused nationalists of logic?\n\n \n I want us all to have independent Countries. I would love to see an Independent England, Scotland etc. I don't see anywhere I came off as anti-English.\n \n I also mentioned the Royal Family in the context of un-democratic institution not in any other context. In fact many of my fellow Nationalists want to keep Queen Liz as the 'Queen of Scots'. I disagree with them, I would rather Scotland became a fully democratic Republic.",

The UK officially came into existence in 1800, and the Kingdom of Great Britain came into existence in 1707. Claiming that just because they shared a monarch Scotland and England were one country is like claiming that Canada and New Zealand are one country.",

Should I then still swear allegiance? \n \n In America, we are essentially brainwashed into saying the pledge (at least when I was a child we were) before we really even knew what the words meant that we were saying.
