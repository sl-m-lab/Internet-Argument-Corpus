   "I'm debating on the negative team on this issue:\n \n Resolved: that the US Federal government should adopt a policy to substantially increase regulation of genetic engineering.\n \n Now my argument lies around these factors:\n \n There is no need to increase government regulation\n --There is enough regulation (ie FDA USDA EPA)\n --the word substantially means \"a godo amount\" to what extent do you want increase?\n --GE is a young science (30 years), how can there be current regulation when there MAY be risk factors but not definite ones.\n --GE holds a lot of promise (we have to prove this) with such an early regulation, it will screw things up; thus, GE practice and experimentation must continue for both scientists and consumers to view the effects\n --Example (of holding promise) AGRICULTURE and the regulation of GE by the EPA\n --Biotech takes care of pests and is a great promise for farmers, humans, and economy in general (not sure if I will use statement of economy)\n \n Are these arguments logical? And if they are. does anyone have any more ideas to argue against the resolved issue?",
