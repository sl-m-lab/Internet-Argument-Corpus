I will garentee you that Bush would blow you away with his intellect if you ever had a conversation with him. He's not a stupid man. Actually, he's probably one of the few men that a perfect for the Job. I don't agree with everything he does, but he does what he feels is right no matter what other people say. You know what he's all about, he doesn't mess around and try to please everyone. he governs on principle and belief not what polls say. And i think thats a great thing, and thats how it should be. If you don't agree with what he does then don't vote for him, but at least you know where he stands.

   "The difference is, soldiers do not go around killing people that are not shooting back, and if they do they are punished (at least in armies like the American army, Canadian army ext...).\n\n By the way, in the case of Iraq, there are at least 5 cases of that.\n \nDying for freedom and the safety of your country is dying in vain... maybe we just have a different definition of vain. Saddam harboured terrorists, he had training camps for terrorists and openly announced and encouraged attacks on the USA (ever here of pre-emptive strike?). they also imposed something like 15 sanctions on him to totally disarm himself of ALL weapons of mass destruction, not just some. He did not. He messed around with Clinton, and the UN, but not Bush.\n \n Even though they have still elected a new Prim Minister, and they have a Constitution, and we do have to stay longer. Theres still violence in Iraq and it would be irresponsible to back out, wither you disagree with the war or not. America went in there and they must finish the Job they started.\n\n Saddam had no WMD. I was under the idea that everyone knew that. I guess not. My definition of dying in vain is when the soldures go over to fight a war and loose their lives when we have no business being over there anyway. Were there terrorist in Iraq? Yes. Are there terrorist in Saudi Arabia? Well, bin Laden's from there. Are there terrorist in Israel/Palestine? Yes. There are terrorist all over the Middle East. Do we have terrorist in the United States? Yes. I'm not talking about Islamic terrorist in prision here in the US, I'm talking even of the Christian faith. Usually who misinterprit the scripture. However, the Insurgence were not a problem until we went to war. Our freedom was not in question when we went to war with Iraq. We were given no real threat from Iraq until we went to war with Iraq and even then, our only real threat was given to us from bin Laden who (along with most of Islam) saw us going to war with Islam.\n By the way, I remember hearing that Saddam said one time that his favorite American presidents were Clinton AND Reagan.",

   "All right, where do i begin?\n \nCorrect me if you think I'm wrong, but didn't the US invade and occupy Iraq on a unilateral basis without UN support, causing the deaths of untold numbers of innocent civilians including babies and children by our hand?\n\n who out of the UN did not support the invasion of Iraq? France, Russia, and China. All of which were promised oil fields by saddam. It was in their best interest not to go to war with Iraq. And even if that wasn't the case, does it matter? just because the UN doesn't have the guts or is afraid to do what is necessary doesn't make the USA wrong in its actions.\n \nBy the way, in the case of Iraq, there are at least 5 cases of that.\n\n Exactly, only 5. That just proves that this is not something that the USA military practises and honours. That has nothing to do with the military and everything to do with the individual. If those soldiers did in fact do what they have been charged with then they should be charged and imprisoned, and they will be. If anything thats a sign that the USA military does not tolerate that behaviour at all.\n \nSaddam had no WMD. I was under the idea that everyone knew that. I guess not.

Our safety is at risk as along as we do nothing to stop these monsters. Bin Laden was not the only threat. As i said, Saddam harboured terrorist, trained terrorists, and supplied and encouraged terrorist attacks on America. Iraq was just the first in the war on terror, if places, like Iran, do not comply with demands given by the coalition then they will be dealt with, with force if necessary. And the battle for Bin Laden is not over, and we are still fighting it, he will be found. \n \n The soldures are the ones responsible for the deaths of innocent because they are the ones shooting the guns.\n\n Nope, you see the majority of innocent Iraqi deaths are caused by the insurgents with their drive by's and car bombs, not American soldiers. \n \n I'm sorry, but that is an entirely ludicrous statement.
