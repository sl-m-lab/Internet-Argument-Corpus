   "Just to cover myself before someone asks \"Well who decides what situations are right or not?\" let me say that if there is a God then we can assume he is the one who determines whether a situation is good or not although he isn't still in control of making the decision. The situation would include the person or persons involved and their own opinions. It would involve the opinions of the society and culture so this means that our own history and future becomes a part of the decision making process. God would look at all of that and gather information from the things that are really making the decision and those are components involved in the situation such as the feelings and opinions of humans, animals, aliens, ghosts, and whatever else there is. Then he would have to determine how an event will play out over time and how it will affect all the opinions and feelings of those in the future and the angels in heaven who are of course going to be affected based on how it affects those they left behind. The decision making process becomes so large that God may be the only one who can give us a true answer to the question but he is only answering based on what everyone and everything involved has shown to be the answer. So is it good to look at a cloud? If your about to be hit by a truck and your looking at a cloud, probably not, but even then it may have beneficial affects that could be completely unforseen by anyone but God and of course he wouldn't claim it is good or bad unless it had an overall positive or negative affect on everything involved.\n \n I hope this makes sense :)",

   "I think of goodness as the non-talent part of beauty, which turns out to be the same thing as love of beauty. I think of beauty as part talent, part goodness. To avoid a circular definition, one must use a geometric progession. Here's my idea along those lines, which I posted to usenet about a year ago:\n \n It can be shown that it is reasonable from an evolutionary standpoint to suppose that some people try to make the world more beautiful, where beauty consists of a certain combination of talent, love of talent, love of love of talent, love of love of love of talent,.... Define n-love inductively by defining 0-love to be talent, and by defining n-love to be love of n-1 love. How should each n-love be weighted as a component of beauty?\n \n It is reasonable to assume that the ideal that an idealist loves in others is the ideal which he (or she) himself holds. In other words, grouping all the non-talent (n < 0) components of beauty together under the rubric \"goodness\", goodness can be thought of as love of beauty. More precisely, for each n < 0 we must have that the ratio of the weight for n-love to the weight for goodness (this ratio is the extent to which n-1-love is loved) must be equal to the weight of n-1-love as a constituent of beauty. Let L(n) be the weight of n-love as a component of beauty. Then mathematically I am saying that for each n < 0, L(n - 1) = L(n)/(1 - L(0)). Let p be (1 - L(0)); then it is obvious from induction that for each n, L(n) = (1 - p)p^n, the geometric density with parameter p.\n \n To sum, love has a geometric distribution whose parameter p is the fraction of beauty that is love.\n \n I will admit there are problems with this approach. The main difficulty I have with it right now is that talents (like sensitivity) that are especially useful to moral people are somehow more special than talents (like an ability to deceive) that are useful especially to immoral people, and I just don't know exactly how to make it so people with the former talents are considered more good for those talents, as intuitively seems desirable. \n \n What I really like about my approach is that by appreciating talent, it is rooted in reality, whereas by not just appreciating talent, it allows beauty to be defined so that what people find beautiful in someone is basically what they want to see people more like in the long-run. Wanting the world to become (say) more talented at a certain distant point in the future is a dangerous idea, since it allows the possibility that at that distant point people are selfish, and behavior under such a moral system would depend heavily on what distant point is chosen, and would encourage confused people to insufficiently love unselfishness in others because talent is in some sense all they would love.\n \n Not that I don't think intuition is the best working guide for determining whether something is good, but then coming to an intellectual understanding of a decent approximation to a concept is an excellent way of refining our emotional sensibilities about it.\n \n Perhaps God does have better knowledge of what is good than we do. But it doesn't follow that God necessarily wants us to do precisely what we feel he thinks is good. That would mean he would want us to be robots, essentially. We may be supposed upon occasion to have unique moral insights into human existence on our own particular corner of the universe, the planet Earth, and I suspect that God (if there is such a being) would want us usually to follow those moral insights because occasionally they might be better than his, just as a mouse may have better insight into proper mouse morality than we have, and presumably God likes the idea of improving his moral philosophy by studying our behavior, which improvement is more likely to happen if we mainly have our own moral viewpoints.",

Goodness is no more a subjective concept than most philosophical concepts. Sure, people disagree somewhat in their intuitive or best rational definitions of goodness. But so it is with the definitions of syntax, truth, validity, beauty, etc., yet you rarely hear people arguing as they do with goodness that these other philosophical concepts are merely subjective concepts scarcely worth talking about. Similarly, some definitions of goodness are preferable to other definitions from a kind of philosophical utility, just as some mathematical definitions are preferable to others. One needs to use the word goodness (or something synonymous) to denote the important philosophical concept as you mean it, because that is the concept you generally are talking about when you use the word--it is the concept of goodness you are likely to have the most insight about if you actually have goodness, because you will be continually using your definition to determine how to live your life. Even if society's conception of goodness is the same as yours, defining goodness in a philosphical context as the former is akin to defining 2 as 1 + 1 +1 - 1 in a mathematical context, which obviously is a less revealing definition than defining 2 as (say) 1 + 1 .\n \n I would argue that most of the moral disagreements between people sincerely claiming to determine the goodness of a behavior stem from disagreements as to what the consequences to the world of the particular behavior would be rather than from disagreements as to the desirability of agreed-upon consequences arising from differing conceptions of goodness.",

   "Dear General Populace,\n \n Everything that is not material is a subjective and conceptual tool designed by any given society.\n \n My knowledge, in part, is based on my own beliefs and on those of a philosopher names Thomas Hobbes, who is famous for a work called The Leviathan.\n \n Hobbes' theories indicate that all mankind is selfish. Keep in mind, good and evil have no meaning yet. Selfishness simply pertains to our need to survive as human beings. When we are starving, we eat whatever we can to live. Survival.\n \n Now, from this point, groups of people emmerge and develop a code of living from primitive behavior. Mankind learns that it is easier to hunt in parties larger than 1. Ofcourse then the food is shared, but hunting is far more successful. The building blocks of soceity. Survival becomes easier. Split the duties, communism, if you will.\n \n As you can clearly see then, anything that is beneficial to the survival of society, the greater people, becomes known as good, and the benefit of harming society for ones own interest becomes known as bad or evil.\n \n We build these expectations then, of good and bad. Do unto others... however, we are still intrinsicly selfish. Society works to accomodate and simplify survival.\n \n There is not a single person, who does good, who is not selfish. Not even Jesus. Anyone who does 'good' does so to benefit oneself as well as the others around them. I gave a little old lady a dollar because she couldn't afford milk. I felt really good about myself. I was proud. I was selfish. I wanted to feel that I had made a contribution. I wanted the pride and honor of knowing I had helped someone. I wanted to believe that when my turn comes around, someone will be there to lend me a dollar. What I did was selfish, good, and in the benefit of society.\n \n Take cannibalism for instance. We cannot say that it is bad out of truth. We can only say that it is bad out of our societies' belief in self-preservation. Same goes for murder and stealing. We call these bad because they have negative and detrimental effects on our society. Every society, however, has their own beliefs on punishment and retribution.\n \n Unfortunately, all cultures cannot come to all-encompassing terms as to what good and bad are and how to deal with them, therefore, we are always fighting our fellow man. There is no truly universal standard code for living, and, thus, many societies will never get along with each other.\n \n In conclusion, I own your souls and my rationale is impeccible and inarguable, so don't try. Just accept. Heh. ;)\n \n \n Cheers,\n Leviathan",

   "Dear General Populace,\n Anyone who does 'good' does so to benefit oneself as well as the others around them. \n\n \n \n I disagree. I think people often get confused about where exactly the benefit of being good arises. Good people benefit by being good people, they don't benefit by doing unselfish actions (which you apparently think are impossible). Using your own behavior as an example, people won't be able to tell whether in fact you gave the old lady a dollar for milk. So you will gain no benefit. True, your sanity might benefit slightly inasmuch as screwed-up people tend to hurt others, and so when good people do bad, unjust things it kind of makes them wonder whether they are screwed-up, i.e., addicted to abomination. But of course, people wouldn't have evolved that tendency if they were not good to begin with, inasmuch as then being bad would not be atypical or suggestive of dissipation.\n \n Being good, i.e., having a character that is good, is rewarding. That's because character is comparatively easy to judge. People who are good by (my) definition want to increase the beauty in the world, and beauty is mostly goodness, so they behave unselfishly toward one another, and thus may prosper better than selfish people. Why is character comparatively easy to judge? Because the most important unselfishness is that which occurs toward mates. From love of wife present or future, a good male is less like to waste much of his time chasing mistresses. Similarly, a good female doesn't so much mate for money as a bad male--she is more likely to decide to be a single mother and have sex outside wedlock and is less likely if she does marry to have married for money. But in the romantic sphere, if a bad person deceives a good person as to character to receive unselfish love without in fact being unselfish, yes, he or she will get more offspring, but these offspring will be by insensitive galloots who misjudged character. Thus, these offspring also will tend to be insensitive galoots. So bad deceptive people (inheriting their traits from ancestors) will very much tend to be insensitive as to judging character. And sensitivity toward character is something that is easily judged because you know what your own character is like, and so you can easily judge the extent to which it is understood. Since insensitivity toward character is easy to judge, and since this insensitivity is highly correlated with deceptiveness as to moral character, deceptiveness towards moral character is easy to judge obliquely, which makes moral character easy to judge. \n \n A moderately Hobbesian scepticism towards unselfishness is in fact appropriate when considering unselfishness outside the romantic sphere. If people excessively make moral judgements of others outside the romantic sphere, then the correlation between insensitivity and moral deceit would be expected to be considerably less. Altruists could be at a disadvantage compared with selfish people. Thus, for instance, you should be hesitant to give most of your money to a non-related person because you think he be better than you; and indeed, you rarely see unselfishness of this sort.\n \n Even comparatively simple animals are unselfish. Take the peacock. The peacock wouldn't have fancy tail feathers unless peacocks unselfishly love fancy tail feathers, love of fancy tail feathers, love of love of fancy tail feathers, love of love of love of fancy tail feathers, etc. Such \"good\" peacocks are at an advantage, because they unselfishly love one another while your selfish peacocks do not love one another unselfishly.\n \n If you have looked at Survivor, consider Johnny Fairplay. I knew one or two seconds after looking at him and his mannerisms that he was in all likelihood a despicable person--the loathing was quite instinctive. (And I'm sure many others who watch the show felt the same.) Thus, I knew that he could not be trusted and was unworthy of being treated unselfishly except perhaps because he is a part of a team--he was very likely a bad deceptive individual. But I can not determine which of his particular assertions is a deception--I could not tell, for instance, that he was lying about his grandmother having just died. The reward for unselfishness comes not from doing the unselfish deed (which deeds can be faked well), but from having the unselfish, good character that causes the desire to do the deed.",

You are suggesting that a good person who does something bad recieves more attention than a bad person doing something bad? This is yet another tool designed by us as a collective society. When we recognize someone who continuously benefits society and does something that harms society, yea, we have a tendency to put strong focus on that individual. I do not see how this statement relates to or proves 'inherent good'.\n \n Being good, i.e., having a character that is good, is rewarding. That's because character is comparatively easy to judge.

There is no unselfishness. Wishing to benefit the world's natural beauty is as selfish as anything else. You can give me any situation and I can argue that it is selfsih. Marriage is as selfish an act as any. You develop a bond with a particular person because they typically have common interests. It is a selfish relationship, not a bad one. You are attracted to the body or the personality of another person which results in a selfish union of common interests. Is it not selfish to be attracted to someone? The partners make a commitment not to steal or harm each other (hopefully). This act is selfish and in the best interest of both parties. I still don't know where 'judgement of character' fits in all of this. I agree that, generally, you can tell someone's typical intent, but I don't understand the relation regarding inherent good.\n \n A moderately Hobbesian scepticism towards unselfishness is in fact appropriate when considering unselfishness outside the romantic sphere. If people excessively make moral judgements of others outside the romantic sphere, then the correlation between insensitivity and moral deceit would be expected to be considerably less.

Period. All animals do what is necessary for survival. Female peacocks are 'attracted' to males' feathers. Attracted, thus selfish. Your dog comes to you expecting food or play. You're dog is instinctually selfish. Even infants are inherently selfish. Until they are educated, good and evil do not exist to them. They live to put everything in their mouth until atleast two years of age. If you gave a baby a knife and it stabbed you, you couldn't say it was evil. A baby is a baby. So, if good is learned through education, doesn't it make sense that good is not inherent.\n \n If you have looked at Survivor, consider Johnny Fairplay.

I have never seen Survivor at all, but in response, I would agree that good characters are rewarded in some form or another which drives their need to do good. Look at it this way. You are incapable of doing good without selfishness. All acts of 'good' that you perform are done so for selfish causes. Whether it be honor, money, possession, control, pride, ego, or just in hopes of going to heaven, you are inherently selfish.",

   "You are suggesting that a good person who does something bad recieves more attention than a bad person doing something bad?.\n\n \n No, I don't know where you got this from. Perhaps you misunderstood me. When I said, \"True, your sanity might benefit slightly inasmuch as screwed-up people tend to hurt others, and so when good people do bad, unjust things it kind of makes them wonder whether they are screwed-up, i.e., addicted to abomination,\" I just meant that when a good person does something he thinks is bad or unjust, his behavior makes him (the same good person who did something he thinks might have been wrong) wonder whether he behaved as he did on account of some screwed-up reason. Thus, for instance, if you neglect your worthy, beautiful, well-loved wife because you spend time drinking with lame males at bars, that neglect might be a sign to you if you are a good person that maybe the alcohol is screwing with your brain.\n \n \nWishing to benefit the world's natural beauty is as selfish as anything else.\n \n \n No, I don't think such wishing is selfish. Selfishness is about motive. You can either do something because you want the world to become more beautiful, or you can do it because you want to please yourself, but you can't do both. But even if you define a selfish behavior as a behavior that benefits yourself, good behavior--behavior undertaken to make the world more beautiful--need not be selfish. As a result of giving a lady a dollar, you are a dollar poorer. Except perhaps in an irrelevant psychological sense (irrelevant because doing good only aids the sanity of good people), you lost, you did not gain. People won't think better of you for giving the lady in dire need a dollar, because you could just as easily lie about having given her the dollar and yet receive the same acclaim, without having lost the dollar. \n \n It is true that being good may well be of benefit to yourself, but largely people aren't good because they willed themselves to be good, they're good because it is their nature to be good. In fact, it is mostly your genetic predisposition to goodness that tends to make good people love you unselfishly, and you can't do anything about that. Indeed, people most tend to love unselfishly good mates, and mostly the reason they do so is that they want the caring they expend to be expended on children who are likely to inherit the same predisposition toward goodness, thereby making the world more full of good people in the next generation.\n \n The only way that I can make much sense of what you say is that if you believe that people believe in doing good not largely as a result of having a genetic predisposition to being good. If so, it might make sense that people would love you not so much for what you are, but for what you believe; then, by changing what you believe, you could significantly affect the extent to which society or others love you, and so you could choose to be good for selfish reasons. \n \n Certainly the environment plays a role in developing a person's moral outlook. Put an otherwise good person in a violent, abusive environment, for instance, and you are less likely to get a person who believes in doing good. I will not deny that. \n \n What I am sceptical about is that people mainly do or should love others for what they believe or do as opposed for what they are. It seems to me that if a person genetically endowed with an especially good, beautiful disposition has bad beliefs on account of having been raised in an insufferable environment, that person would be mostly as lovable as a person who by nature has a similar predisposition toward goodness and who has been raised in good circumstance. So believing in doing good won't really be of much if any selfish benefit to you, so you won't really be able to do good for ultimately selfish reasons. \n \n To a greater extent than your natural (genetic) moral disposition predestines your level of goodness, your natural moral disposition predestines the amount others will want to love you unselfishly. Mostly, if your nature is beautiful, you are predestined to be much loved unselfishly even if you don't believe in loving unselfishly, and if your nature is foul, you are predestined not to be much loved unselfishly even if you believe in loving unselfishly.",

That 'good' person had control over his choice. Perhaps substance abuse has something to do with his motives, though, this a different situation which has nothing to do with 'goodness' or levels of it. The fact remains that you have a choice to make as to what is going to benefit you the most. Each person makes a concious, weighable decision as to what they need. If a man feels the need to go out and have drinks with his friends, he does so with the knowledge that he may be endangering his relationship with his wife. If that man chooses to stay home to please his wife, he may be endangering his relationship with his friends. Ultimately, however, a wise man knows which choice will benefit him the most.\n \n No, I don't think such wishing is selfish. Selfishness is about motive. You can either do something because you want the world to become more beautiful, or you can do it because you want to please yourself, but you can't do both.

People won't think better of you for giving the lady in dire need a dollar, because you could just as easily lie about having given her the dollar and yet receive the same acclaim, without having lost the dollar. \n \n Beauty is subjective. Beauty is what each person wants it to be. No two people will agree on what is beautiful and thus beauty is, in a way, something that you are inherently attracted to.\n \n You're right, selfishness is all about motive. Selfishness is about motive based upon action/reaction consequences. You can do anything because you want something to be more beautiful and to benefit yourself. If you choose not to conveniently throw a beer can on the ground, it is because you understand that you are contributing to the decay of your beautiful environment. You don't want to wake up, look out your window, and see a landfill. So you decide not to drop the beer can. You did it for yourself and to preserve the beauty of your environment. You also may have done it out of honor and pride.\n \n It is true that being good may well be of benefit to yourself, but largely people aren't good because they willed themselves to be good, they're good because it is their nature to be good. In fact, it is mostly your genetic predisposition to goodness that tends to make good people love you unselfishly, and you can't do anything about that. Indeed, people most tend to love unselfishly good mates, and mostly the reason they do so is that they want the caring they expend to be expended on children who are likely to inherit the same predisposition toward goodness, thereby making the world more full of good people in the next generation.\n \n Being 'good' always benefits yourself. People are 'good' for five reasons. You were taught to be 'good' and respectful from childhood by your parents (but you don't really know that its good, it just how you were taught). You learned to be 'good' by repitiously forcing 'good' actions. Your religions requests your services. Bad only gets you in trouble or hurts others. You've gained enough knowledge from education to know that 'good' is simply a subjective tool that benefits everyone.\n \n The need to do 'good' is not genetic. There is no proof of that whatsoever. Two parents who are 'good' can raise hellspawn children.\n \n The only way that I can make much sense of what you say is that if you believe that people believe in doing good not largely as a result of having a genetic predisposition to being good. If so, it might make sense that people would love you not so much for what you are, but for what you believe; then, by changing what you believe, you could significantly affect the extent to which society or others love you, and so you could choose to be good for selfish reasons. \n \n [b]What I have stated is that everyone is inherently selfish. You cannot survive alone without a selfish instinct. Selfishness is also self-benefit and self-awareness. Good is a societal term. It indicates that the society is the greater power and that doing good will benefit society and thus yourself to the greater extent. My laws of good state that: Giving a little money to someone else will be more beneficial to you and society than stealing a lot of money from someone else. Most people subconciously understand this. Good has no meaning if you are alone on a desert isle.\n \n Certainly the environment plays a role in developing a person's moral outlook. Put an otherwise good person in a violent, abusive environment, for instance, and you are less likely to get a person who believes in doing good. I will not deny that. \n \n What I am sceptical about is that people mainly do or should love others for what they believe or do as opposed for what they are.

So believing in doing good won't really be of much if any selfish benefit to you, so you won't really be able to do good for ultimately selfish reasons. \n \n This is getting really abstract. You still don't fully understand what I mean by selfish. Selfishness could be the prospect of a reward, whether it be tangible or intangible. Selfishness could be nothing more than an act of honor or pride(particularily where beauty is concerned). Selfishness could simply be hope that someone will be there to help you when you need it.\n \n To a greater extent than your natural (genetic) moral disposition predestines your level of goodness, your natural moral disposition predestines the amount others will want to love you unselfishly. Mostly, if your nature is beautiful, you are predestined to be much loved unselfishly even if you don't believe in loving unselfishly, and if your nature is foul, you are predestined not to be much loved unselfishly even if you believe in loving unselfishly.\n\n \n Once again, I'd like to see your proof for 'genetic goodness'.\n \n weeeeee,\n LEVIATHAN",

   " Selfishness could be the prospect of a reward, whether it be tangible or intangible. Selfishness could be nothing more than an act of honor or pride(particularily where beauty is concerned). \n\n \n I don't see why doing something because you want a certain feeling is selfish. So, for instance, if you like the feeling you get when you do something good, and you do good accordingly, aren't you being unselfish? It may well be that your feeling that some behavior would be good could be more accurate than your intellectual impression as to the goodness of the behavior. In fact, I suspect moral intuition generally is more reasonable than dry rational moral insight as regards non-addictive matters. Thus, I don't often use my exact definition of goodness to robotically decide the goodness of a phenomenon when life requires such a decision, I more use my intuition--but I don't see why so doing would suggest I am being selfish--in fact, I think and feel I am being more unselfish by so behaving. To me a selfish person is one whose motivation is more-or-less to improve his or her success from an evolutionary standpoint.\n \n \nYou cannot survive alone without a selfish instinct\n \n \n I don't agree. You can survive by considering yourself to be beautiful and worthy of survival. You can realize that the universe is more beautiful with you in it. When I say \"altruism\" I don't mean to imply \"sacrifice\". I know some philosophers use the term \"altruistic\" to denote just sacrificial behavior, but I don't like that usage, because obviously people who don't care about their own selves aren't likely to exist in any large numbers, and more importantly, I don't like the term \"normative,\" which some philosophers use to denote unselfishness that doesn't exclude some love of self, because it sounds too much like \"normal,\" and of course what is good often isn't normal (though sometimes it is).\n \n I do think moral traits are largely genetic. And indeed, I believe that most behavioral traits have important genetic and environmental causes.\n To use an exaggerated example, I doubt whether a bacteria can have advanced morals no matter what environment it is raised in, mainly because its genes are inadequate--it's hard to be moral when you don't have a brain.",
