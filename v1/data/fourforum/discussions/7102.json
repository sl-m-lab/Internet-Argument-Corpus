   "One of the most important things about stopping the violence against gays and lesbians, is find where hate breeds. Where the climate of violence is perpetuated with lies and sterotypes that dehumanize and demoralize others. I ask each of you to take one moment of your day and visit the Straight Talk Radio Web Discussion Board. This board belongs to the ex-gay minister, Stephen Bennett. Although his intentions may be good (right?) his methods are hurtful and dehumanizing for gays and lesbians. He claims to help gays and minister to gays, but he never does that. In stead he has a radio show completely dedicated to spreading lies and myths about gays. My goal is to start to chain reaction of posters on his board that post a progay message until he gives up and shuts down the board. What good will that do you ask? It will leave one less place in the world for hate to breed, one less place to contibute to the climate of violence against gays and lesbians. I have posted the details of this on my blog, and hope that you will pass this on to everyone you know. I am sure we can shut this down by annoying the anti-gay people with pro-gay messages. A sample post for you to write is own my blog. Feel free to post that message or write one of your own. Just make sure you do not sink to his level, don't leave him a hateful message, leave one that is polite and honest. There is plenty of good wholesome science to refute his messages. \n \n He has made if difficult to be able to post on his board, but patience will prevail and we can stop the message of hate.",

Besides, that forum is not anything close to being all the resources that Bennett provides, from what I understand. So there ARE other resources.\n \n \nwell, no. Sorry, it is lies based on junk science. It is stuff known by the scientific world to be untrue, that makes it lies.\n\n \n Science can't speak for a person's individual feelings. if a person shares that he no longer feels gay, at that point the 'science' doesn't matter. At the end of the day, it's simply a person sharing what he feels in his life. Frankly, I find the idea of anyone claiming to know someone's feelings better than the person feeling them to be pretty arrogant.\n \n \nThat is fine by me!

He's demanding \"that the antigay group American Family Association stop promoting and selling a video featuring a man who claims he has been 'cured' of homosexuality who has since been dumped as a spokesman for the group for continuing to have sex with men. The video, It's Not Gay, features Michael Johnston, who once said he had been 'cured' his homosexuality through the 'power of Jesus Christ.' Johnston, who is HIV-positive, stopped serving as a spokesman for so-called ex-gay groups in 2003 after reportedly continuing to meet men through the Internet and having unsafe sex with them.\"\n \n Mr. Besen didn't mince words: \"The American Family Association is blatantly committing fraud by suggesting that Johnston is heterosexual, and they are promoting the spread of HIV by continuing to use him as a spokesperson. . . . This episode suggests a stunning lack of integrity on the part of the American Family Association and utter contempt for the truth. If they have a shred of decency and morality, they will immediately stop selling the tape and apologize for their disgraceful behavior.\"\n \n AFA produced the It's Not Gay video in 2000 and has been distributing it ever since: that's two years and counting after the Michael Johnston \"miracle\" was exposed as a fraud.\n \n According to their PR, AFA claims the video has \"been shown in over 10,000 churches.\" But Wildmon claims it's appropriate in other settings as well: \"It fits the time period for Sunday School class use or a short Bible study or even a mid-week worship service.\" AFA claims \"the video's content is suitable for adults and older youth.\" Lies presented as truth in churches and Bible study groups: a perfect fit.\n \n As of this writing, the AFA \"store\" still features the following promo:\n It's Not Gay\n SKU: V04\n \n It's Not Gay presents a story that few have heard, allowing former homosexuals the opportunity to tell their own story in their own words. Along with medical and mental health experts, these individuals express a clear warning that the sanitized version of homosexuality being presented to students is not the whole truth. Uncompromising, yet compassionate, It's Not Gay is a fair and balanced approach to this challenging subject.\n \n Runtime is 28 minutes.\n \n Suggested Donation: $15.00Available now on DVD!\n \n This attests to AFA's continued, updated and enthusiastic shilling of what can only be called a blatant lie. And what's their motivation for doing so? To disenfranchise, demean, denigrate and hurt gays, lesbians, their children and their families. The AFA record supports that assertion.\n \n \"Disenfranchise, demean, denigratey and hurt.\" Surely the leaders of the Christian Right are smart enough to realize their vitriolic antigay rhetoric and accompanying actions have other consequences.

There's twenty!
