Each state gets as many electoral college votes as it has senators and congressmen. The state holds a popular election, and whichever candidate gets the most popular votes gets all the electoral votes for that state. Whichever candidate gets the most electoral votes total wins the election. This does mean you can have the most popular votes and still lose.\n \n Make sense?",

   "What country are you from?\n \n Each state in the US has a certain number of representatives in the two houses of congress (House of Representatives, and Senate). The senate is composed of 2 members from each state, while the House has a minimum of 1 representative plus an additional representative for each X number of people residing in that state (i can't recall off hand what that number is. for example if the number is 10,000 then a state with 100,000 residents would send 10 representatives to the house). \n \n Who the next president is decided by a given number of individuals (the individuals cast votes) equal to the number of individuals they have in the house and the senate. So alaska (with relatively few people) would have a total of three votes that would go to deciding whom the next president is. The way these \"electors\" are selected is by (generally) a popular vote in each state.\n \n So on election day, individuals aren't really voting for president. Instead they are voting for who they want to cast a ballot for the state. The parties select individuals before election day, so a \"vote\" for president Bush, is really a vote for some odd number of people who have promised to vote for Bush during the electoral college (electoral college is the name of this whole process).\n \n Generally all the electoral votes of a state go to the party that has a majority in that state... there are a few exceptions i believe, but not many. \n \n I hope that wasn't too confusing...\n \n The justification for all this is presidential candidates will have to keep in mind the parts of the country that are less populated. If all a candidate needed was a majority of the population the candidates would pander to the biggest cities and states with the most people. \n \n California has the most electoral college votes, however an individual residing in california has a much weaker \"voice\" than an individual in alaska. lets pretend with 100,000 people california had 12 electoral college votes (continuing the above example), and alaska with 10,000 people had 3 electoral college votes. that means each elector in california represents 8,333 people, but each elector in alaska represents 333 people. \n \n i hope this wasn't too confusing... you can probably find more accurate and clear information about this on google... do a search for \"Electoral College\"",
