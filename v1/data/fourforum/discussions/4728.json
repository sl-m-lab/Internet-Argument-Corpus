   "Sigma,\n \n I tried to PM this to you but it wouldnt let me because it was too long.\n \n Hey Sigma,\n \n here is some interesting stuff on the \"if you end abortion now/before abortion was made legal back alley coat hanger\" argument. It was written by Dr. Francis Beckwith who is a professor at baylor. He is pro-life and he is very credible. \n \n Here is part of an essay he wrote dealing with the argument: If you would like to see more of his arguments, just let me know.\n \n I do hope you'll check out the article,\n Chloe\n \n Argument from the Dangers of Illegal AbortionsAnyone who keeps up with the many pro-choice demonstrations in the United States cannot help but see on pro-choice placards and buttons a drawing of the infamous coat hanger. This symbol of the pro-choice movement represents the many women who were harmed or killed because they either performed illegal abortions on themselves (i.e., the surgery was performed with a \"coat hanger\") or went to unscrupulous physicians (or \"back-alley butchers\"). Hence, as the argument goes, if abortion is made illegal, then women will once again be harmed. Needless to say, this argument serves a powerful rhetorical purpose. Although the thought of finding a deceased young woman with a bloody coat hanger dangling between her legs is -- to say the least -- unpleasant, powerful and emotionally charged rhetoric does not a good argument make. \n \n The chief reason this argument fails is because it commits the fallacy of begging the question. In fact, as we shall see, this fallacy seems to lurk behind a good percentage of the popular arguments for the pro-choice position. One begs the question when one assumes what one is trying to prove. Another way of putting it is to say that the arguer is reasoning in a circle. For example, if one concludes that the Boston Celtics are the best team because no team is as good, one is not giving any reasons for this belief other than the conclusion one is trying to prove, since to claim that a team is the best team is exactly the same as saying that no team is as good. \n \n The question-begging nature of the coat-hanger argument is not difficult to discern: only by assuming that the unborn are not fully human does the argument work. If the unborn are not fully human, then the pro-choice advocate has a legitimate concern, just as one would have in overturning a law forbidding appendicitis operations if countless people were needlessly dying of both appendicitis and illegal operations. But if the unborn are fully human, this pro-choice argument is tantamount to saying that because people die or are harmed while killing other people, the state should make it safe for them to do so. \n \n Even some pro-choice advocates, who argue for their position in other ways, admit that the coat hanger/back-alley argument is fallacious.  For example, pro-choice philosopher Mary Anne Warren clearly recognizes that her position on abortion cannot rest on this argument without it first being demonstrated that the unborn entity is not fully human. She writes that \"the fact that restricting access to abortion has tragic side effects does not, in itself, show that the restrictions are unjustified, since murder is wrong regardless of the consequences of prohibiting it...\"[9]\n \n Although it is doubtful whether statistics can establish a particular moral position, it should be pointed out that there has been considerable debate over both the actual number of illegal abortions and the number of women who died as a result of them prior to legalization.[10] Prior to Roe, pro-choicers were fond of saying that nearly a million women every year obtained illegal abortions performed with rusty coat hangers in back-alleys that resulted in thousands of fatalities. Given the gravity of the issue at hand, it would go beyond the duty of kindness to call such claims an exaggeration, because several well-attested facts establish that the pro-choice movement was simply lying. \n \n First, Dr. Bernard Nathanson -- who was one of the original leaders of the American pro-abortion movement and co-founder of N.A.R.A.L. (National Abortion Rights Action League), and who has since become pro-life -- admits that he and others in the abortion rights movement intentionally fabricated the number of women who allegedly died as a result of illegal abortions.  \n \n How many deaths were we talking about when abortion was illegal? In N.A.R.A.L. we generally emphasized the drama of the individual case, not the mass statistics, but when we spoke of the latter it was always \"5,000 to 10,000 deaths a year.\" I confess that I knew the figures were totally false, and I suppose the others did too if they stopped to think of it. But in the \"morality\" of the revolution, it was a useful figure, widely accepted, so why go out of our way to correct it with honest statistics. The overriding concern was to get the laws eliminated, and anything within reason which had to be done was permissible.[11]\n \n Second, Dr. Nathanson's observation is borne out in the best official statistical studies available. According to the U.S. Bureau of Vital Statistics, there were a mere 39 women who died from illegal abortions in 1972, the year before Roe v. Wade.[12] Dr. Andre Hellegers, the late Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Georgetown University Hospital, pointed out that there has been a steady decrease of abortion-related deaths since 1942. That year there were 1,231 deaths. Due to improved medical care and the use of penicillin, this number fell to 133 by 1968.[13] The year before the first state-legalized abortion, 1966, there were about 120 abortion-related deaths.[14]\n \n This is not to minimize the undeniable fact that such deaths were significant losses to the families and loved ones of those who died. But one must be willing to admit the equally undeniable fact that if the unborn are fully human, these abortion-related maternal deaths pale in comparison to the 1.5 million preborn humans who die (on the average) every year. And even if we grant that there were more abortion-related deaths than the low number confirmed, there is no doubt that the 5,000 to 10,000 deaths cited by the abortion rights movement is a gross exaggeration.[15]\n \n Third, it is simply false to claim that there were nearly a million illegal abortions per year prior to legalization. There is no reliable statistical support for this claim.[16] In addition, a highly sophisticated recent study has concluded that \"a reasonable estimate for the actual number of criminal abortions per year in the prelegalization era [prior to 1967] would be from a low of 39,000 (1950) to a high of 210,000 (1961) and a mean of 98,000 per year.[17]\n \n Fourth, it is misleading to say that pre-Roe illegal abortions were performed by \"back-alley butchers\" with rusty coat hangers. While president of Planned Parenthood, Dr. Mary Calderone pointed out in a 1960 American Journal of Health article that Dr. Kinsey showed in 1958 that 84% to 87% of all illegal abortions were performed by licensed physicians in good standing. Dr. Calderone herself concluded that \"90% of all illegal abortions are presently done by physicians.\"[18] It seems that the vast majority of the alleged \"back-alley butchers\" eventually became the \"reproductive health providers\" of our present day.\n \n 8.

   "Sigma,\n \n I tried to PM this to you but it wouldnt let me because it was too long.\n \n\n \n I'm not exactly sure your point with this article. Was it merely to show that pro-choice groups exaggerate claims? That they use emotional rhetoric to sway people to their side? Trust me, you have told me nothing new. In fact, I am somewhat amused that you pointed this out, given that pro-life groups are guilty of all this and more.\n \n It said: Although the thought of finding a deceased young woman with a bloody coat hanger dangling between her legs is -- to say the least -- unpleasant, powerful and emotionally charged rhetoric does not a good argument make . I almost peed myself laughing when I read this. Whatever powerful, emotional images you believe pro-choice are guilty of, pro-life groups are many times worse. What is the mental image of a deceased young woman compared to the physical picture of bloody aborted fetus'? I have seen pro-life groups holding huge posters outside high-schools, and pro-life groups hold them up in front of clinics. How much do you want to bet that the fellow here would defend one while attacking the other?\n \n The article speaks of fallacies yet fails to mention the statement of \"abortion is wrong because it's murder!\" that pro-life people seem very fond of. This is the exact fallacy the article mentions, using an unproven point (abortion is murder) to hold up an unproven point (abortion is wrong).\n \n I point this out not to absolve pro-choice groups of guilt, but to say: Before pointing fingers, make sure your own house is in order.\n \n This entire article is also something of a strawman argument as well. The argument that illegal abortions will almost inevitably occur if abortion is banned is not a justification for legal abortions (per se). As I see it, since illegal abortions will almost inevitably occur if abortions are banned, the complaint is that pro-life people would rather see more women hurt (and yes, more women are hurt with illegal abortion than legal) than actually solve the problems with society. To ban abortion and declare the problem solved is extremely irresponsible and does nothing to help society or women. \n \n If you would, chloe, please link to the study the article mentions about the number of illegal abortions? I'm amazed they managed to eek out numbers, given that not even the CDC has exact figures since illegal abortions were not tracked. The most compelling evidence I've seen looked at the birth rates for various ethnic groups the years previous to abortion being legal to the years after, corrected for various factors such as better birth control methods. They found little change in the birth rates, indicating the number of abortions most likely did not increase or decrease.\n \n Yes, I know pro-choice groups mislead with stats and figures. This is nothing new, but I feel it is dishonest to point this out without acknowledging your own groups shortcomings in the same area.",

There is no reliable statistical support for this claim.\n \n It is already a highly accepted figure done by the World Health Organization that criminal abortions are performed into the tens of millions each year.

A more reliable source would be James C Mohr's historical accounts about criminal abortion after the nearly complete nationwide abortion ban within the states after the 1850s. In his studies, Mohr reports that illegal abortion rate quickly \"increased.\" \n Even fertility rates didn't excessively drop after 1973 like they should have. While abortion unevenly rates doubled between 1973 to 1979. However the fertility rate evenly decreased by .10% annually since 1972 to 1979. Hence how can pro-lifers explain the unreflective comparisons between abortion and fertility rates between the two? Or how can the explain the static fertility rate in Poland after the 1993 national referendum that criminalized abortion?\n The claim that abortions were far and few is without proof. Even today a woman is just about as likely to have an abortion no matter if it is legal or illegal.\n \n \n \n \"Fourth, it is misleading to say that pre-Roe illegal abortions were performed by \"back-alley butchers\" with rusty coat hangers.

Abortion was restrictively legal by 1940 when hospitals were allowed to practice \"therapeutic abortions\" which greatly reduced the reliance of \"back alley abortions\" and doctors began to provide the bulk of illegal abortions ever since. As long as ethic committees or doctors approved of a patient's demand for an abortion for whatever reason it was considered \"therapeutic\" and therefore legit. \n A better comparison would be Brazil, according to a survey done by the Lancet in 1993, over 90% of criminal abortions are self-performed with instruments or poisons.",

The mother can give the child up to adoption and let him/her cherish life instead of never knowing the bliss and hell that envelops us all everyday that we are blessed to live.

If you believe in a \"living constitution\" then we can talk on another forum (government) and discuss why that thought is crazy.

   "Ok, here is the evidence you've presented me. (Steeeve sent evidence I requested via PM)\n \n http://zygote.swarthmore.edu/intro5.html\n \n (Apologies to Steeeve, this is not the exact website. What he was actually saying was that the genetic view [in the link] is a scientific way of looking at the beginning of life. The correct site is much more specific [I hope, I haven't looked as of yet] then the link on this post; also, there is another link on Steeeve's post #35. Very sorry Steeeve.)\n \n It gives seven examples of when life may begin. I wasn't talking about that, I was talking about the seven characteristics of a living thing.\n \n The Seven Characteristics of Living Things\n \n Feeding\n ...\n All living organisms need to take substances from their environment to obtain energy, to grow and to stay healthy.\n \n Movement\n \n All living organisms show movement of one kind or another. All living organisms have internal movement, which means that they have the ability of moving substances from one part of their body to another. Some living organisms show external movement as well - they can move from place to place by walking, flying or swimming.\n \n Breathing or Respiration\n ... \n All living things exchange gases with their environment. Animals take in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide. \n \n Excretion\n ...\n Excretion is the removal of waste from the body. If this waste was allowed to remain in the body it could be poisonous. Humans produce a liquid waste called urine. We also excrete waste when we breathe out. All living things need to remove waste from their bodies.\n \n Growth\n \n When living things feed they gain energy. Some of this energy is used in growth. Living things become larger and more complicated as they grow.\n \n Sensitivity\n ...\n Living things react to changes around them. We react to touch, light, heat, cold and sound, as do other living things.\n \n Reproduction\n ...\n All living things produce young. Humans make babies, cats produce kittens and pigeons lay eggs. Plants also reproduce. Many make seeds which can germinate and grow into new plants.\n \n (From this model viruses have been said to be a nonliving thing, so it might not be fool-proof. Also note that a living thing must fulfill all seven characteristics) A fetus feeds, a fetus has internal movement, a fetus breathes (actually the mother breathes, but gases are exchanged to and from the fetus), a fetus excretes (I think the mother takes on that responsibility as well, but energy is produced by the fetus), a fetus does grow. These characterisitics are met.\n \n Now, we come to sensitivity, I've been told that until a certain week (can't remember) a fetus does not have a nervous system. Also a fetus does not develop reproductive organs until a certain week (don't really remember that either). So using these seven characterisitics, which are scientifically supported, a baby is not alive until it develops a nervous system and reproductive organs (which is a some week, forgive me for neglecting to look that up).\n \n Of course this is just science, you can object to it if you want. In fact, if anyone can really say anything against this on scientific grounds, I'd go with it.\n \n ~Edited for misinterpretation May 1st 2005.~",

The best argument I have for that is they had they're reproductive organs at one point, a fetus does not. But even with reproductive organs the fetus still needs a nervous system to be alive. On top of that (I just thought of this), the fetus doesn't really feed, breathe, or excrete on it's own; it relies on the mother. Without the mother, the fetus dies; so we could call a fetus a parasite. Using that logic (which is a bit twisted by now), noone should have to support a parasite with their own bodily resources.\n \n I'm done with the post, but I'm hoping someone might read this; if not, all the \"work\" I've put into it has gone wasted. emoticon_cry so sad.",
