   "The biblical book of Ezekiel (chapters 26-28) contains detailed prophecies concerning the total and permanent destruction of the island city of Tyre at the hands of king Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon. As it turns out, these prophecies appear to have been a spectacular failure.\n \n Ezekiel's prophecies regarding the fate of Tyre...\n \n [*]Eze 26:7 For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring upon Tyrus Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, a king of kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and companies, and much people.\n [*]Eze 26:9 And he shall set engines of war against thy walls, and with his axes he shall break down thy towers.\n [*]Eze 26:14 And I will make thee like the top of a rock: thou shalt be a place to spread nets upon; thou shalt be built no more: for I the LORD have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.\n [*]Eze 26:19 For thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall make thee a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I shall bring up the deep upon thee, and great waters shall cover thee;\n [*]Eze 26:21 I will make thee a terror, and thou shalt be no more; though thou be sought for, yet shalt thou never be found again, saith the Lord GOD.\n [*]Eze 27:32 What city is like Tyrus, like the destroyed in the midst of the sea?\n [*]Eze 27:36 thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt be any more.\n Never happened. King Neb besieged the city for 13 years from circa 585 BCE onwards, but was unable to take Tyre. Indeed, the author of Ezekiel later admits to this...\n \n Eze 29:18-19 Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyrus: every head was made bald, and every shoulder was peeled: yet had he no wages, nor his army, for Tyrus, for the service that he had served against it: Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall take her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army.\n \n ...King Neb's troops were paid from what they could plunder from cities which they had conquered. Obviously, since they had failed to take Tyre after 13 years, they had no wages. So, according to Ezekiel, God apparently directed Neb's attention to Egypt as a sort of compensation for his failure to take Tyre. \n \n Apologists have attempted to get around this problem by proposing two rather dubious explanations...\n \n [*]King Neb did, at least, destroy mainland Tyre\n [*]The prophecy was eventually fulfilled by Alexander the Great\n But these explanations raise more problems than they solve. Tyre was an island city with suburbs on the mainland. Ezekiel refers to these suburbs as Tyre's \"daughters\" (Ez. 26.8). Neb never took Tyre, which Ezekiel describes as a \"rock\" in \"the midst of the sea\". \n \n Claiming that Alexander the Great eventually fulfilled these biblical prophecies is worse than absurd - it borders on the desperate. Although Alexander did sack portions of the city in 332 BCE, it was quickly rebuilt (attested to by the fact that, eighteen years later, the island city withstood for fifteen months a siege by Antigonus, one of Alexander's generals) and continued to prosper under subsequent Seleucid, Roman, and Byzantine rule. Moreover, Ezekiel mentions the failed king Neb by name as the destroyer of Tyre in his prophecies and (as can be expected) makes no mention of Alexander the Great (or anyone else for that matter). Apologists nevertheless cling to the Alexander explanation by pointing to Ezekiel's declaration that Tyre would be attacked by \"many nations\" (Ez 28:7). But Ezekiel, himself, informs us that king Neb of Babylon was a \"king of kings\" (Ez 26:7), implying that Neb ruled over an empire. Indeed, this is confirmed by...\n \n Jer 34:1 The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion, and all the people, fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof\n \n Quotes...\n \n With few exceptions, Tyre has been occupied continuously from the middle of the 3rd millennium B.C. through the Greco-Roman and Byzantine periods. -- Anchor Bible Dictionary\n \n Ezekiel's predictions that Tyre would fall never came true; at a later date he transferred the judgement against Tyre to Egypt. -- New Jerome Bible Commentary (Roman Catholic)\n \n The island city of Tyre exists to this very day with a population of approx. 30,000.",

   "Hello Orion:\n \n \nThe biblical book of Ezekiel (chapters 26-28) contains detailed prophecies concerning the total and permanent destruction of the island city of Tyre at the hands of king Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon. As it turns out, these prophecies appear to have been a spectacular failure.\n\n \n Your chapters listed in brackets are more than one prophecy. Chapter 26 was a prophecy against Tyre, while chapter 28 was one against Tyre's king. These are two different prophecies. Chapter 27 is not a prophecy, but a lament (grief) for Tyre.\n \n Chapter 26 has as a lot threats against Tyre, but let us see what the main points were. In Ezekiel 26:7 we read that Nebuchadnezzar will ride down from the North. Ezekiel 26:8-13 we read of how the Bablyonians will invade Tyre. \n \n The next verse, Ezekiel 26:14 is an interesting one that says that Tyre \"will never be rebuilt\". But what does it actually mean? In what context do or should we take this verse in? To illustrate, why did God want to destroy Tyre? To answer this, we need to know a little bit about the city of Tyre itself. Ezekiel tells us that the people in Tyre had become spoilt. They tried to find contentment in their wealthy shopping centres and had become very proud, quarrelsome, rich and dishonest - they tried to find happiness in material things. Notice, that God despises all of these things. When the Babylonians besieged Tyre in 586 BC and after 13 years the city finally surrended to its enemies, they most likely would have destroyed much of the city during and after the war. In any military campagin in another city, buildings are going to be destroyed, as will towers. This is evident in the current Iraq war. \"Innocent\" civilians would have died by the hands of the Babyloian army.\n \n Perhaps by saying that Tyre will never be rebuilt again, Ezekiel may have meant that it will never be rebuilt to the way that it was before it was besieged, i.e. a rich, dishonest and proud city who's trade flourished. I highly doubt that the city of Tyre now, if your quote (i.e. The island city of Tyre exists to this very day with a population of approx. 30,000) is true, are a very rich, dishonest and proud city.\n \n Basically, we can tell that from Ezekiel 26 that the Babylonians will break down walls and demolish houses and throw stones, timber and rubble into the sea. It does not say that the Babylonians had to \"keep\" Tyre. From my understanding of this chapter, it basically tells us that the Babylonians were going to wreck damage and terror. This was fulfilled when the Babylonians besieged Tyre in 586 BC. Furthermore, the LORD said that He will make it a desolate city - notice how time is not used here. The existence of people through the ages in Tyre does not contradict Ezekiel's prophecy.\n \n Your quotes can be easily explained if my the verse that \"Tyre will never be rebuilt again\" is correct. If it is, then the occupation of Tyre does not go against Ezekiel's prediction. Tyre is obviously not a wealthy, dishonest, violent and proud city any more (i.e. it is not like it was before the Babylonians went in), is it?",

But it is written that no one knows the time when Jesus will return, not the Disciples, priets, not even Jesus Himself, but His Father. They are not failed prophecies, we shall see when He will return.

In fact a fabulous city of great power, wealth and trade.\n \n \n As it turns out, these prophecies appear to have been a spectacular failure. Ezekiel's prophecies regarding the fate of Tyre...\n\n \n Hmmmmm\n \n \n\n \n [*]Eze 26:7 For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring upon Tyrus Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, a king of kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and companies, and much people.\n [*]Eze 26:9 And he shall set engines of war against thy walls, and with his axes he shall break down thy towers.\n [*]Eze 26:14 And I will make thee like the top of a rock: thou shalt be a place to spread nets upon; thou shalt be built no more: for I the LORD have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.\n [*]Eze 26:19 For thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall make thee a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I shall bring up the deep upon thee, and great waters shall cover thee;\n [*]Eze 26:21 I will make thee a terror, and thou shalt be no more; though thou be sought for, yet shalt thou never be found again, saith the Lord GOD.\n [*]Eze 27:32 What city is like Tyrus, like the destroyed in the midst of the sea?\n [*]Eze 27:36 thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt be any more.\n \n\n \n Why quote out of context, and we should really look again at the seven prophesies in chapter 26:3-21. (See Next Post)\n \n \nNever happened. King Neb besieged the city for 13 years from circa 585 BCE onwards, but was unable to take Tyre. Indeed, the author of Ezekiel later admits to this...\n\n \n O.K.\n \n More......\n \n \nEze 29:18-19 Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyrus: every head was made bald, and every shoulder was peeled: yet had he no wages, nor his army, for Tyrus, for the service that he had served against it: Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall take her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army.\n \n ...King Neb's troops were paid from what they could plunder from cities which they had conquered. Obviously, since they had failed to take Tyre after 13 years, they had no wages. So, according to Ezekiel, God apparently directed Neb's attention to Egypt as a sort of compensation for his failure to take Tyre. \n \n Apologists have attempted to get around this problem by proposing two rather dubious explanations...\n \n [*]King Neb did, at least, destroy mainland Tyre\n [*]The prophecy was eventually fulfilled by Alexander the Great\n But these explanations raise more problems than they solve. Tyre was an island city with suburbs on the mainland. Ezekiel refers to these suburbs as Tyre's \"daughters\" (Ez. 26.8). Neb never took Tyre, which Ezekiel describes as a \"rock\" in \"the midst of the sea\". \n \n Claiming that Alexander the Great eventually fulfilled these biblical prophecies is worse than absurd - it borders on the desperate. Although Alexander did sack portions of the city in 332 BCE, it was quickly rebuilt (attested to by the fact that, eighteen years later, the island city withstood for fifteen months a siege by Antigonus, one of Alexander's generals) and continued to prosper under subsequent Seleucid, Roman, and Byzantine rule. Moreover, Ezekiel mentions the failed king Neb by name as the destroyer of Tyre in his prophecies and (as can be expected) makes no mention of Alexander the Great (or anyone else for that matter). Apologists nevertheless cling to the Alexander explanation by pointing to Ezekiel's declaration that Tyre would be attacked by \"many nations\" (Ez 28:7). But Ezekiel, himself, informs us that king Neb of Babylon was a \"king of kings\" (Ez 26:7), implying that Neb ruled over an empire. Indeed, this is confirmed by...\n \n Jer 34:1 The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion, and all the people, fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof\n \n Quotes...\n \n With few exceptions, Tyre has been occupied continuously from the middle of the 3rd millennium B.C. through the Greco-Roman and Byzantine periods. -- Anchor Bible Dictionary\n \n Ezekiel's predictions that Tyre would fall never came true; at a later date he transferred the judgement against Tyre to Egypt. -- New Jerome Bible Commentary (Roman Catholic)\n \n The island city of Tyre exists to this very day with a population of approx. 30,000.\n\n \n Interesting!\n \n More to follow!",

   "Stop and consider...... \n \n emoticon_idea \n \n Ezekiel declares seven prophesies in chapter 26:3-21:\n \"Therefore thus says the Lord God: 'Behold, I am against you, O Tyre, and will cause many nations to come up against you, as the sea causes its waves to come up [Prediction 1]. And they shall destroy the walls of Tyre and break down her towers; and I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her like the top of a rock [Prediction 2]. It shall be a place for spreading nets in the midst of the sea; it shall become plunder for the nations [Prediction 3]... He will slay with the sword your daughter villages in the fields; he will heap up a siege mound against you, build a wall against you, and raise a defense against you [Prediction 4]... They will plunder your riches and pillage your merchandise; they will breakdown your walls and destroy your pleasant houses; they will lay your stones, your timber, and your soil in the midst of the water [Prediction 5]... I will make you like the top of a rock; you shall be a place for spreading of nets, and you shall never be rebuilt [Prediction 6]... I will make you a terror, and you shall be no more; though you are sought for, you will never be found again [Prediction 7].\n Quote:\n \n This Prophesy must be compared to external historical accounts, and must be scrutinized for validity. \n \n ....Though mainland Tyre was destroyed in 573 B.C. by Nebuchadnezzar's army (Prediction 4), Tyre continued to flourish and remained a powerful city many years thereafter.\n \n Alexander the Great came to Tyre in 333 B.C. to deny its people the use of the Persian fleet. The people of Tyre refused to allow Alexander the Great to enter into their city, an act that enraged the conqueror and compelled him to raise arms against the city. He reasoned that since Tyre dominated the seas, all of Phoenicia would be his if he conquered this illustrious city. \n \n Since Tyre had a strong naval fleet and Alexander's forces did not, his plan was to build a mole across the mainland to the island. Alexander the Great used the stones and timber of the ruined mainland Tyre, and threw these materials into the sea to create a mole and towers from which to launch an offensive (Prediction 5). As Alexander the Great led his men into battle against this city, he was able to scrounge up eighty Phoenician vessels for reinforcements. Rhodes, Soli, Mallus, Lycia, and Macedon all gave vessels to help Alexander the Great destroy Tyre along with about 4,000 Greek mercenaries (Prediction 1). It took Alexander seven months before Tyre was finally overtaken. After Tyre's defeat by Alexander, Tyrian commerce and wealth went to Alexandria. \n \n During the Crusades the Crusaders used Tyre as a military base, and were overrun by the Muslims in 1291 A.D. The Muslims burned the houses, temples, and buildings, and utterly destroyed the city. What was once a great city became as stark as the top of a rock (Prediction 2), and today many secular scholars note that Tyre is now a place where fishermen frequently lay their nets out to dry (Prediction 3). To this day the city of Tyre has not been rebuilt, and it remains are bare rock with no ruins to mark its glorious past (Prediction 6).\n \n Ezekiel 26:21 says that Tyre will never be found again. An interpretation of this verse is that men will seek to bring Tyre to its past position of commercial power. The illustrious city of Tyre has never reemerged since its complete destruction centuries ago (Prediction 7).\n \n The fulfillment of Ezekiel's Prophecy gives clear evidence to the authority of God's Word. \n \n Deconstructing Tyre - By Will Skiles",

   "Rev. 22:20 - Surely I come quickly.\n\n \n Orion, why start being a Biblical literalist now?\n \n Would that refer to the time, or the Speed?\n \n Consider that......\n \n The opening statement of the book of Revelation indicates that it deals with certain things that &#8220;must shortly come to pass.&#8221; \n \n Some have misunderstood this language and concluded that the entire book of prophecy was soon to be fulfilled - including events like the Second Coming of Christ (19:11-16), and the Day of judgment (20:11-15). \n \n The Greek expression for &#8220;shortly&#8221; (en tachei) has at least two possible meanings. First, it can denote chronological nearness (cf. Acts 25:4). Even when it has reference to time, though, in prophetic literature it can be used in an extremely relative sense. \n \n It is possible that the reference may simply denote that the things foretold in this book would commence (though not complete) their unfolding in the near future. \n \n Second,  en tachei  can mean &#8220;quickly, speedily&#8221; (cf. Luke 18:8; Acts 12:7). \n \n This would suggest that the events - whenever they transpire, near or distant - would occur without delay, suddenly. It is thus a serious mistake to make the prophetic time frame of the book of Revelation hinge on this solitary expression.\n \n This term can refer to speed, rather than time; See Acts 12:7; Luke 18:8.",

After a thirteen-year siege, Nebuchadnezzar broke down the city gates and found the city virtually abandoned.

Though mainland Tyre was destroyed in 573 B.C. by Nebuchadnezzar's army (Prediction 4), [/INDENT]\n \n Just what do you think was left after 13 years?

The trading partners and the goods traded are detailed in Chapter 27.\n \n Why be an apologist for Tyre? Who was the King, what was his name?

And again, \"The LORD will judge His people.\" 31It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. \n \n 32But recall the former days in which, after you were illuminated, you endured a great struggle with sufferings: 33partly while you were made a spectacle both by reproaches and tribulations, and partly while you became companions of those who were so treated; 34for you had compassion on me in my chains, and joyfully accepted the plundering of your goods, knowing that you have a better and an enduring possession for yourselves in heaven. 35Therefore do not cast away your confidence, which has great reward. 36For you have need of endurance, so that after you have done the will of God, you may receive the promise: \n \n \"For yet a little while,\n And He who is coming will come and will not tarry. \n Now the just shall live by faith; \n But if anyone draws back, \n My soul has no pleasure in him.\n \n But we are not of those who draw back to perdition, but of those who believe to the saving of the soul.",

Among their finds were a series of 12 tablets of a great epic. The tablets dated from about 650 BC, but the poem was much older. The hero, Gilgamesh, according to the Sumerian King List,3 was a king of the first dynasty of Uruk who reigned for 126 years.4\n \n However, in the legend, Gilgamesh is 2/3 divine and 1/3 mortal. He has enormous intelligence and strength, but oppresses his people. The people call upon the gods, and the sky-god Anu, the chief god of the city, makes a wild man called Enkidu with enough strength to match Gilgamesh. Eventually the two fight, but neither can win. Their enmity becomes mutual respect then devoted friendship.\n \n The two new friends set off on adventures together, but eventually the gods kill Enkidu. Gilgamesh grievously mourns his friend, and realises that he too must eventually die. However, he learns of one who became immortal&#8212;Utnapishtim, the survivor of a global Flood.

   "Zeus, Marduk, and God\n \n By Keith Cox\n \n \"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.\" Thunderously Genesis begins. And it continues, \"And God said, 'Let there be light' and there was light. (Genesis 1:3) \n \n The rest of creation unfolds in the same manner: God speaks and it is. God, effortlessly and extravagantly, calls forth creation out of nothingness. \n \n The significance of God's supremacy in creating can be easily missed unless you compare it with other stories of creation. Take the Ancient Greek creation story. Uranus fathers Chronos only to have Chronos overthrow his rule. Then Chronos fathers Zeus, and Zeus rises up and overthrows Chronos. It is in this tumultuous battling of the gods that the world comes to be formed. Compare that with \"and God said, and it was.\"\n \n Or consider the Babylonian creation story. Tiamat, a god of chaos and destruction, rules until she is destroyed in fierce battle with Marduk. Marduk then establishes Babylon as a symbol of his glory. Here again there is battling of the gods. But no swords clash in Genesis chapter one. There, all that can be heard is the loving breath of God speaking creation.\n \n This creational truth is of singular importance to the [Christian] believer. Since the fall, creation has been a tumultuous and dangerous place for humans. Yet the believer has hope for the ultimate triumph of goodness, and this hope is buttressed by the supremacy of God in creation. We have a fervent hope that as it was in the beginning, so it shall be in the end. \n \n The human story begins in the Garden of Eden and ends in the City of God, the New Jerusalem. This is our trajectory. And this trajectory is essential to Christ's vision of His ministry. Christ heralds the advent of the Kingdom of God here on earth. Jesus proclaims that God is on the move. Or as C. S. Lewis put it in the Chronicles of Narnia, \"Aslan is on the move.\" \n \n Yes, we get mired in the details of our lives and miss it. Yes, we can be overcome by the misery and evil of this present age. But Christ calls us to see that His Kingdom is on the move, active and real today. And we are heading towards its fulfillment. \n \n This does not mean we take the dour mindset of looking for the apocalypse with every new crisis. It means we hope for the final reign of goodness in the face of each new crisis. The Kingdom of God is at hand. Neither Tiamat, nor Chronos, nor the devil can hold it back.\n \n Source:: RZIM.org",

   "Orion, this is perhaps where you face the biggest roast ever.\n \n You have never posted anything about the nonsense and fuzzy vague meanings of these Epic myths. So vague, how could any contradiction exist?\n \n Come clean and QUICKLY! THere is no comparison between the Truth found in the Bible and the vague and spectulative Vedas.\n\n \n Richbee, I think it's perhaps time for you and I to have a little talk. Unlike you, who apparently views the Judeo/Christian Bible as God's inerrant word, I view all such ancient manuscripts as an attempt by these folks to define their relationship with the divine. This collection would include the writings of Judaism, Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, and many others, of which you are no doubt unfamilar. All of them have warts, which only reinforces the concept that they are, after all, human compositions, and that we should simply respect them for what they are. For example, the Genesis creation stories constitute ancient, pre-scientific myth, as does the Genesis flood story, the Bable story, and the Exodus story. Likewise, I think that we can finally put to bed the NT stories of Jesus' virgin birth, his casting out of demons, his floating into the sky toward heaven following his return from the dead, and NT prophecies of his imminent return. I suggest that you walk your spiritual path, Richbee, but that you also keep your head straight.",

I will attempt a new thread!\n \n In the children's book, The Blind Men and the Elephant, Lillian Quigley retells the ancient fable of six blind men who visit the palace of the Rajah and encounter an elephant for the first time.

An elephant is like a wall.\" The second blind man put out his hand and touched the trunk of the elephant. \"How round!

   "This has been explained to you before, Orion.\n\n \n You mean, the tap dance?\n \n \nIn Ezekiel 26:3, the prophet said that Tyre would be attacked by many nations because of its treatment of Israel. Babylon / Nebuchadnezzar was just one of the nations. And although Ezekiel 26:7 on alludes to King Neb & Company, ?THEY? (Ezek. 26:12) refers back to the ?many nations? in 26:3. So your claim that Ezekiel admits failure is poppycock, and rests on an ill-conceived premise to begin with.\n\n \n Pay attention, EZ...\n \n The biblical book of Ezekiel (chapters 26-28) contains detailed prophecies concerning the total and permanent destruction of the island city of Tyre at the hands of king Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon. As it turns out, these prophecies appear to have been a spectacular failure.\n \n Ezekiel's prophecies regarding the fate of Tyre...\n [*]Eze 26:7 For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring upon Tyrus Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, a king of kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and companies, and much people.\n [*]Eze 26:9 And he shall set engines of war against thy walls, and with his axes he shall break down thy towers.\n [*]Eze 26:14 And I will make thee like the top of a rock: thou shalt be a place to spread nets upon; thou shalt be built no more: for I the LORD have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.\n [*]Eze 26:19 For thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall make thee a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I shall bring up the deep upon thee, and great waters shall cover thee;\n [*]Eze 26:21 I will make thee a terror, and thou shalt be no more; though thou be sought for, yet shalt thou never be found again, saith the Lord GOD.\n [*]Eze 27:32 What city is like Tyrus, like the destroyed in the midst of the sea?\n [*]Eze 27:36 thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt be any more.\n Never happened. King Neb besieged the city for 13 years from circa 585 BCE onwards, but was unable to take Tyre. Indeed, the author of Ezekiel later admits to this...\n \n Eze 29:18-19 Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyrus: every head was made bald, and every shoulder was peeled: yet had he no wages, nor his army, for Tyrus, for the service that he had served against it: Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall take her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army.\n \n ...King Neb's troops were paid from what they could plunder from cities which they had conquered. Obviously, since they had failed to take Tyre after 13 years, they had no wages. So, according to Ezekiel, God apparently directed Neb's attention to Egypt as a sort of compensation for his failure to take Tyre. \n \n Apologists have attempted to get around this problem by proposing two rather dubious explanations...\n [*]King Neb did, at least, destroy mainland Tyre\n [*]The prophecy was eventually fulfilled by Alexander the Great\n But these explanations raise more problems than they solve. Tyre was an island city with suburbs on the mainland. Ezekiel refers to these suburbs as Tyre's \"daughters\" (Ez. 26.8). Neb never took Tyre, which Ezekiel describes as a \"rock\" in \"the midst of the sea\". \n \n Claiming that Alexander the Great eventually fulfilled these biblical prophecies is worse than absurd - it borders on the desperate. Although Alexander did sack portions of the city in 332 BCE, it was quickly rebuilt (attested to by the fact that, eighteen years later, the island city withstood for fifteen months a siege by Antigonus, one of Alexander's generals) and continued to prosper under subsequent Seleucid, Roman, and Byzantine rule. Moreover, Ezekiel mentions the failed king Neb by name as the destroyer of Tyre in his prophecies and (as can be expected) makes no mention of Alexander the Great (or anyone else for that matter). Apologists nevertheless cling to the Alexander explanation by pointing to Ezekiel's declaration that Tyre would be attacked by \"many nations\" (Ez 28:7). But Ezekiel, himself, informs us that king Neb of Babylon was a \"king of kings\" (Ez 26:7), implying that Neb ruled over an empire. Indeed, this is confirmed by...\n \n Jer 34:1 The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion, and all the people, fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof\n \n Quotes...\n \n With few exceptions, Tyre has been occupied continuously from the middle of the 3rd millennium B.C. through the Greco-Roman and Byzantine periods. Anchor Bible Dictionary\n \n Ezekiel's predictions that Tyre would fall never came true; at a later date he transferred the judgement against Tyre to Egypt. New Jerome Bible Commentary (Roman Catholic)\n \n The island city of Tyre exists to this very day with a population of approx. 30,000.",

So, he either misunderstands or misinterprets Isaiah 7 as a prophecy of the birth of Jesus. Problem is, Isaiah 7 does not concern itself with a birth to occur 700 years later nor does it convey the idea of a virgin birth... \n \n Look, the young woman is with child and about to give birth to a son. Isa. 7:14 (JPS Tanakh) \n \n \nBTW, why does the possibility of a Gay Jesus disturb you?\n\n \n \nYeah it does, and I think it disturbs Jesus too, who is the same God who gave his admonitions against gay sex (Lev. 18:22, Lev. 20:13, etc.).\n\n \n Who said anything about gay sex? Who said anything about Jesus engaging in any kind of sexual activity at all? Please re-read my question to you. Again, what is it about the possibility of a Gay Jesus that disturbs you?",

Some say she was...too young to have a baby. The ot [sign or miracle] is that the young girl shall bear a child. \n \n In addition, Isaiah's wife, who is named as the prophetess in Chapter 8, verse, 3, had already borne a son, Shearjashub [7:3], and would not qualify as the young girl, naarah, that Rashi calls the almah mentioned in Isaiah 7:14. \n \n Rabbinic tradition has gone to great lengths to disprove the tenet of a virgin birth. The rabbis teach, for example, that bethulah is the only word for virgin and that, on the contrary, almah can apply to any young woman.\n \n Yet, Rabbi Radak, in his comment on Isaiah 7:14, believes that the word almah could mean virgin: \n \n Elem means young boy, the male, and almah means young girl [naarah].

Matthew was therefore dependent on the writing of such a man for the production of his book. What Matthew has done, in fact, is to produce a second and enlarged edition of Mark. Moreover, the changes which he makes in Mark's way of telling the story are not those corrections which an eyewitness might make in the account of one who was not an eyewitness. Thus, whereas in Mark's Gospel we may be only one remove from eyewitnesses, in Matthew's Gospel we are at one remove further still. \n \n",

   "Trebor, here's what the ancient Rabbis said concerning Isaish 53:\n \n Rabbi Moses Alschech(1508-1600) says:\n \"Our Rabbis with one voice accept and affirm the opinion that the prophet is speaking of the Messiah, and we shall ourselves also adhere to the same view.\"\n \n Babylonian Talmud: \"The Messiah --what is his name?...The Rabbis say, The Leper Scholar, as it is said, `surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him a leper, smitten of God and afflicted...'\" (Sanhedrin 98b) \n \n Midrash Ruth Rabbah: \"Another explanation (of Ruth ii.14): -- He is speaking of king Messiah; `Come hither,' draw near to the throne; `and eat of the bread,' that is, the bread of the kingdom; `and dip thy morsel in the vinegar,' this refers to his chastisements, as it is said, `But he was wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquities'\"\n Targum Jonathan: \"Behold my servant Messiah shall prosper; he shall be high and increase and be exceedingly strong...\"\n \n Zohar: \"`He was wounded for our transgressions,' etc....There is in the Garden of Eden a palace called the Palace of the Sons of Sickness; this palace the Messiah then enters, and summons every sickness, every pain, and every chastisement of Israel; they all come and rest upon him. And were it not that he had thus lightened them off Israel and taken them upon himself, there had been no man able to bear Israel's chastisements for the transgression of the law: and this is that which is written, `Surely our sicknesses he hath carried.'\"\n \n Rabbi Moses Maimonides: \"What is the manner of Messiah's advent....there shall rise up one of whom none have known before, and signs and wonders which they shall see performed by him will be the proofs of his true origin; for the Almighty, where he declares to us his mind upon this matter, says, `Behold a man whose name is the Branch, and he shall branch forth out of his place' (Zech. 6:12). And Isaiah speaks similarly of the time when he shall appear, without father or mother or family being known, He came up as a sucker before him, and as a root out of dry earth, etc....in the words of Isaiah, when describing the manner in which kings will harken to him, At him kings will shut their mouth; for that which had not been told them have they seen, and that which they had not heard they have perceived.\" (From the Letter to the South (Yemen), quoted in The Fifty-third Chapter of Isaiah According to the Jewish Interpreters, Ktav Publishing House, 1969, Volume 2, pages 374-5)\n \n Rabbi Mosheh Kohen Ibn Crispin: This rabbi described those who interpret Isaiah 53 as referring to Israel as those: \"having forsaken the knowledge of our Teachers, and inclined after the `stubbornness of their own hearts,' and of their own opinion, I am pleased to interpret it, in accordance with the teaching of our Rabbis, of the King Messiah....This prophecy was delivered by Isaiah at the divine command for the purpose of making known to us something about the nature of the future Messiah, who is to come and deliver Israel, and his life from the day when he arrives at discretion until his advent as a redeemer, in order that if anyone should arise claiming to be himself the Messiah, we may reflect, and look to see whether we can observe in him any resemblance to the traits described here; if there is any such resemblance, then we may believe that he is the Messiah our righteousness; but if not, we cannot do so.\" (From his commentary on Isaiah, quoted in The Fifty-third Chapter of Isaiah According to the Jewish Interpreters, Ktav Publishing House, 1969, Volume 2, pages 99-114.)\n \n Additional Rabbinic quotes in the following link:\n \n http://www.hearnow.org/isa_com.html",

   "Orion, your tunnel-vision argument that Isaiah 53 refers to Israel has so many holes in it that it's just not viable. Besides not even fitting the description of the servant in that passage (see my posts to Trebor for what you have to gloss over and ignore to try to sustain that viewpoint), you also have the following problems to deal with:\n \n In Isaiah 41 through 53 you have Israel as a servant of God. You have also Cyrus king of Persia as a servant of God. You have the prophet Isaiah as a servant of God. And you have the Messiah, the Sufferng Servant as a servant of God. In fact, He is the final Servant of God in whom God finds His perfect sacrifice for sin. Israel served as a servant but fell short of perfection. Cyrus served as a servant but surely does not represent God's perfect will - only His remedial will to make up for the failure of the servant Israel. And Cyrus is not the Suffering Servant for sure. So, how many servants can you fathom or gloss over here?\n \n In the Bible there are many servants, but only one premier servant (Christ). In the Bible there are various sons of man, but Jesus is THE Son of Man, who is Lord of the Sabbath. Various \"gods\" are alluded to but there is only ONE true God. There are many (false) Christs, but only ONE true one. So we cannot immediatly assume that Israel is the Suffering Servant of Isaiah chapter 53. For in Isaiah God has more than one servant. In fact, Israel does not even fit the description of the Servant in Isaiah 53.\n \n Nice try.",

Verses 3 and 4 speak of the servant's \"grief\" but the Hebrew word here is \"choli\" -- \"sick\" Verse 3 says \"we hid as it were our faces,\" as if the speakers were embarrassed by the servant' appearance, but the Hebrew \"mistar\" is singular -- the suffering servant arouses contempt just like someone who hides his face. Verse 5 speaks of \"stripes,\" a specific wound resulting from a whipping, but the Hebrew \"heverto\" is more general -- bruise or injury -- without reference to whip marks. Verse 6 in the KJV reads \"the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all\" but the grammatical structure suggests \"wounded him with our sin,\" the implication being -- not that the servant took on the responsibility for someone else's sin, but rather that what someone else did hurt the servant.\n \n The Jews for Judaism analysis of Isaiah 53 makes these additional points about translation: in verse five, rather than \"he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities,\" the prefix \"mem\" means \"from,\" not \"for\", i.e. the speakers of the verse hurt the servant, not that he was punished by G-d as a substitute for them. In verse 11, the Hebrew \"yatsdeek\" means \"will make just\" (by bringing the Torah), not \"will justify (someone's sins by taking their punishment).\"\n \n If you incorporate these different translations into the text, you get a markedly different impression. \"He hurt a lot and knew what sickness was\" just does not sound like\"A man of sorrow and acquainted with grief.\" \"We despised him as someone who hid his face\" does not mean the same as \"we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised.\" In short, the almost reflex identification of the chapter with Jesus depends on the translation of the text -- not on the text itself.\n \n",

   "Orion, your tunnel-vision argument that Isaiah 53 refers to Israel has so many holes in it that it's just not viable.\n\n \n The servant poetry of Isaiah runs from chapter 41 through 56. Several times within these chapters, the author identifies the servant as Israel. For example...\n \n Isa 41:8 But thou, Israel, art my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend. \n \n Isa 44:21-22 Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for thou art my servant: I have formed thee; thou art my servant: O Israel, thou shalt not be forgotten of me. I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee.\n \n Jesus had transgressions and sins? One would hardly think so.\n \n The point which the author was attempting to get across is that Israel shall serve as God's instrument in bringing enlightenment to the gentile nations. Those very nations which caused Israel to suffer, shall, according to the author of Isaiah, come to see that Israel was, in fact, a servant and instrument of God. \n \n Attempts by Christian fundamentalists such as yourself to find Jesus in these verses is no different than their (your) attempts to find Jesus in, say, Isaiah 7. It don't work, EZ. I fully understand your desire to try and find Jesus in the OT, but I suggest that you approach the subject with a degree of intellectual honesty, as opposed to attempting to defend that which cannot be defended.",
