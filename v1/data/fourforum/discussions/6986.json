   "OK, Gang. Three weeks until the post season and Indy looks to repeat Miami's undefeated season. Your picks for 12/04/05.\n \n Buffalo is on the road against the Fish. I don't care if Buffalo has another 2 and 14 season, as long as the wins are against Miami.",

   "My beloved Chicago Bears are playing archrival the Green Bay Packers. You have to live near the Illinois/Wisconsin boader outside of Chicagoland to understand the intensity of this rivalry amoungst the fans. Loyalty is roughly split down the middle.\n \n It's been 12 long years since the Bears have beaten the Packers on their home field, Soldier Field. On Sunday that streak comes to an end, hopefully. The Packers are still a very good team, much better than their record suggests and they still have Brett Farve but the Bears have the numero uno defense in the NFL. If Farve gets rattled early he will start throwing interceptions early and the Bears will blow out the Pack. If the Bears defense doesn't get heavy pressure early on Brett the Pack could win.\n \n Either way it should be a very good game. And, they play each other again up in the frozen tundra of Green Bay to end the season.\n \n Bears 17 Cheeseheads 10",

The Bears defense beat Farve to bloody pulp in the bitter cold winds off of Lake Michigan. He really should retire before a Bears blind-side blitz cripples him for life two weeks from today.",
