In a phone interview Wednesday ahead of the union report's release, the U.M.W. president, Cecil E. Roberts, discussed its conclusions and said of the alternative, \"I believe the company pursued this early on because it was their best defense in litigation.\"\n \n The company dismissed the new finding. \"The U.M.W.A.'s report is nothing more than political grandstanding,\" the chief executive, Bennett K. Hatfield, said in a statement. \"The report is wholly unreliable as an investigatory finding and is designed solely to further the union's political and organizing agenda.\"\n \n The International Coal Group's investigation, concluded a year ago, determined that \"an unusually large lightning strike of roughly three times the normal strength was measured near Sago\" at the time of the explosion, on Jan. 2, 2006. The lightning touched off the blast, which was fueled by methane that had naturally accumulated in an abandoned, recently sealed section of the mine, the company's investigators found.\n \n The two state reports, from the West Virginia Office of Miners' Health Safety and Training and from Gov. Joe Manchin III, agreed that lightning was the most likely cause, although the governors' investigators said friction from a rock fall could not be ruled out. And the miners office report noted, \"How the electricity from lightning entered the sealed-off area is still under investigation.\"\n \n In the interview on Wednesday, Mr. Roberts said, \"They still can't prove how lightning got into the mine,\" and pointed out that the bolt had struck two miles from the site of the explosion.\n \n The union's investigators found it more likely that rocks falling from the mine's ceiling had created sparks \"as the materials rub together or become dislodged and strike other materials as they fall.\"\n \n The report also argued that the Sago fatalities were a direct result of industry delays and obstruction of measures that would increase mine safety, including the installation of communication systems enabling miners to talk to those above ground after an explosion; tracking systems that would help find missing miners; and underground safety chambers, with access to fresh air, where miners could take refuge in an emergency.\n \n \"If we'd been able to talk to the miners at Sago, they'd be alive today,\" Mr. Roberts said.\n \n Chris Hamilton, senior vice president of the West Virginia Coal Association, an industry group, said communications and tracking technologies were being put in place. \"We are seeing them installed, yes,\" he said in a telephone interview.\n \n As for the safety chambers, not everyone is convinced they are a good idea, since \"the primary objective should be escape at all costs\" after an accident, Mr. Hamilton said.",
