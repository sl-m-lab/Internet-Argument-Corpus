Is anyone here aware about the real reason why the two council offices got closed down? Many news media sources such as The Telegraph or The New York Times insist that it was due to some political motivation, etc. But that's ######## and chief editors of these newspapers and other news media know it! They lie to their audience because they are paid for turning the world against Russia. \n So, what happened to British Council in Russia in sober fact? Firstly, this organization was not properly registered to work on the territory of Russia. Secondly, BC evades taxes. Lastly, this organization is known to be sponsoring various NGOs and youth organizations (various extremist movements among them) that work against current political system of Russia and strive for change of power. Do I need to say that that's illegal in every other country so why making Russia an exception? \n As this takes place, an incident with the organization's director Stephen Kinnock comes to the front. He was stopped by Russian police officers for driving offence a day before closing British Council offices. After Stephen Kinnock was stopped, it turned out that he was drunken and there were two hookers sitting on the rear seat! According to Russian laws, drunken driving leads to detention but Stephen Kinnock was not arrested after all because he has got legal protection as an accredited diplomat. So that's what he was doing instead of dealing with problems of British Council in Russia! \n That's nice, isn't it? So after all that I begin to think that the whole fuzzbuzz about the closing in American and British media was merely an attempt to frame up Russia itself and allow Stephen Kinnock get away with it!",
