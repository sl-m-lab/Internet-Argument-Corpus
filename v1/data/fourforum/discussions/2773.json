   "I'm getting real sick and tired of the utterly retarded issue of disease, homosexuality and marriage. Many aganist the marriage claim homosexuality's higher risk of disease is grounds to deny marriage. Pathetic. Diseases is not grounds to deny or stop marriage in virtually any region or any state or any country. They also ignore that the majority of people WITH dieases are not gays. Straight can get diseases like gays, yet they aren't calling for straights with dieases and straights with very promiscous lifestyles to be denied marriage. Doublestandard to say the utmost least. In addition, they refuse to support sexual education, as well as condoms and refuse to admit that marriage is a known partner reducer. They say they are aganist the spread of diease yet offer NO solutions to stopping it, even OBSTRUCTING known, proven solutions. \n \n IF you are going to argue that gays should be denied marriage on the grounds of diease, you must therefore argue that straights must be too, as well as those who contract a diease must have their marriage nullified. \n \n Diseases has no revelance towards marriage so stop using it as a argument.",
