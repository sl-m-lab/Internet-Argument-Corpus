For example, the public school may have a better science curriculum, but a parent, IMO, is not necessarily remiss in their duties if they remove a child from an environment that includes, as part of \"normal\", daily life, drug dealing, sexual promiscuity as a \"for granted\" aspect of peer relationships, sexual harassment in the hallways, cash shake downs in bathrooms, bomb threats, gangs, weapons.

The definition of abuse is what is perpetrated upon the child. If a child is molested, it's not going to change because a licensed teacher did it, rather than a parent.\n \n You have said that teaching a child creationism is child abuse. But only when a parent does it, not a teacher. That doesn't make any sense!\n \n Consider, too, that when we judge crimes, we take into account the intentions of the perpetrator to harm. If someone is hit by a car and killed -- the person driving is more guilty if they knowingly mowed the person down. If they accidentally harmed them, without intending to do so, we move from murder to involuntary manslaughter. If they were criminally negligent, for example, drunk and then getting behind a wheel, maybe up another notch again, to voluntary manslaughter.\n \n So, apart from whether or not the so-educated child has been abused (or hit by a car).

They're not supposed to be \"up for sale\" in terms of helping the government harm people.\n \n Well, teachers are supposed to behave in accordance with a set of principles towards children.

The state has a list of frameworks that are required by law to be covered by the class. Technically, introducing the mainstream point of view and following it immediately by derogatory criticism (however asinine) qualifies as addressing the required material. Put a question on the unit test asking for the evolutionary viewpoint and then for the creationist counterargument that they accept instead, and that's enough.\n \n \nI wouldn't be surprised to see them spouting all kinds of imaginary nonsense about other things, too. From slavery, to WW II, to the Holocaust ....\n\n Such is the danger of allowing private schooling without prohibitions. The best we can do is mandate teaching certain things, which some people (especially libertarians and anarchists) already find appalling.

It's a well-planned political ploy: The wording of the bills generally sound nice and harmless. Public school teachers can introduce any material that they think is appropriate; it's academic freedom. So when people object, the standard retort is, \"What, you're not for academic freedom? You don't think your pet ideas can stand up to scrutiny?\" The irony is that this is the strategy and response from the people who can't win in the scientific community, so they try via the school boards, then whey they can't win via the school boards, they try via legislation.
