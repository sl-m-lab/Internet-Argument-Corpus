   "i am very interested in the way creationists think. creationism's sole existence is to bring down Darwinism, not for its self-proclaimed scientific agenda, and i will explain why i think so later on. look at the situation from afar; creationists attack an area of science that is extremely well documented, extremely well supported by (as i say) a sky-high tower of evidence, that is accepted by everyone who understands the ins and outs of it, with absolutely nothing. no documentation whatsoever, no evidence whatsoever, and no support whatsoever from people who understand the ins and outs of the situation. why put up such a fight that you are inevitably going to lose, proclaiming something that is ultimately false?\n \n im usually one who stands up for the underdog or minority groups, but this is an instance where i will not. first of all, i usually stand up for the group that is experiencing harm or injustice, and in this case, it is not the underdog of creationism, the ones on the receiving end of this argument are students. there is a threat in schools from primary school up to the university level of students being taught something in science class that is utterly wrong on scientific levels. creationism has no place in the science classroom because it is a) not a legitimate scientific theory and b) is religious doctrine in pseudo-scientific drag. the way to get the curriculum in schools changed is through school board meetings, and in the unfortunate case of Dover Pennsylvania, creationism happened. enraged and rather smart parents rightly took the school board to court where we were fortunate enough to have such an openminded and intelligent (albeit republican) judge to rule that intelligent design was not fit for science classrooms on the basis of the first amendment, on separation of church and state. this is a case of David vs Goliath, but this time Goliath stomps David the bully and everyone else benefits.\n \n i saw a program on TV about children psychology, where a researcher asked children questions about certain objects that inherently have no function and asked them why that object exists. the children always go for a functional answer, such as sharp rocks exist so animals can scratch their backs. do creationists simply think like children in trying to find purpose in things that may not have a purpose at all? possibly. but i think there is a deeper reason.\n \n the strongest proponents of intelligent design are christians. i have been around christians my whole life, most of the time being an atheist, and the one thing ive noticed is that christians will do just about anything to get you to join their church. a side not is that christians are very easily offended and will exempt themselves from criticism (see the thread \"Science is not Atheistic?! Really?! Then prove it!!\" in the Debate Challenges forum).\n \n upon being confronted with Darwinism, the christians formed an anti-Darwinian movement called creationism to promote christianity, inject it into schools to convert more people, while at the same time bring down the biggest threat to their church. in my opinion, church goers, theistic believers have been indoctrinated, mostly from birth to believe in God, Jesus and the church. tradition is the only reason most theistic believers are religious. to find out the reason for this passing down of indoctrination, you have to pay attention to where the church and especially the Vatican gets its money from. the christian church is one of the most profitable organizations in the world. science doesnt even come close. so its no wonder christians are so pushy, its for money. if an organization were to proclaim the same sort of thing that christianity proclaims, it would be a cult. but pass the idea down through thousands of years and you no longer have a cult, you have a believable, honest, pure-spirited religion.\n \n though i hate to sound like im making up one of fartingle's conspiracy theories, these are just my predictions; that chistians are indoctrinated and delusional into giving and getting money for the church, and creationism is a tool to do that. it has no scientific basis, yet it clearly has religious implications. i just have to ask, why not?",

   "As an ex-creationist :-D I think its fitting that I say something in defense of the \"underdog\". \n \n First, creationism pre-dates Darwin, so its purpose is totally independent of evolution whatsoever. Second, creation is supported by the literalist interpretation of the bible, which is believed by christians who regard the bible as inerrant and completely true. So incidentally it has nothing to do with science. Third, intelligent design, which (you may be surprised to know) doesn't come bundled with creationism all the time, WAS created in an effort to defend creationism for the attacks of the scientific theories by fighting fire with fire, so to speak. By showing that \"science\" supports the biblical implications of creation, creationists have more armor to support what they believe in, because even they (some of them) realize that blind faith can only get you so far....\n \n You don't need intelligent design or anything it teaches to believe in and promote creationism. Before ID was developed, faith was all that was necessary, and still is. As far as teaching creation in schools, again that only became an issue when evolution started being taught in schools, and, much to the distress of christian parents, kids started questioning how could the bible be 100% inerrant? Before that, there was nothing in science that really flew in the face of the validity of the bible, or couldn't be swept under the rug with apologetics or \"God moves in mysterious ways\". \n \n There are a few schools of thought on this among christianity itself. First is the christian that doesn't believe in creation and thinks that somehow its irrelevant to the bigger picture of salvation. They have no problem with evolution, the big bang, and whatever science throws at them. Next is the christian that believes that God is the intelligent guiding force behind the phenomena, and partially believes in science. Then there are those that use intelligent design as a tool of science to counter-attack the science of evolution. This is the group whose sole purpose is to discredit darwinsim, and they target students and young minds to plant the seed of doubt as far as these controversial scientific ideas are concerned. That's the group that it seems you have beef with. Finally we have the true fundamentalist. They believe in creation and in absolutely anything written in the bible, and have no interest in science whatsoever, whether it be from the darwinist or id-ists. They simply keep their eyes closed to anything that could possibly contradict their beliefs and apply unquestioning faith to their foregone conclusions. \n \n Of course, these aren't four categories that creationist fall into but more like four points on a sliding scale from total belief in science to no belief in science. And for each mix and flavor of beliefs you can think of, there's a non-denominational church that preaches it. If not, there soon wil be. \n \n Your question probably should have been concerning the mind of the ID-ist. I agree with you on most of the points. They are deluded and sometimes deceitful, often totally misunderstanding what evolution is in the first place, and know just enough science to be considered dangerous. They obviously don't follow the scientific method because any investigation they undertake is for the purpose of nothing else but supporting their preconceived notion. They are sometimes charasmatic and slick, purporting to build a convincing case to their audience while aware that their entire argument has already shown to be flawed. They also simcerely believe that they are doing their fellow christians a favor, but if you look at the beliefs of the rest of the christians, they either know better or don't care.",

   "First, creationism pre-dates Darwin, so its purpose is totally independent of evolution whatsoever.\n\n That's just not true.

The literalistic interpretation of the Bible is somewhat recent. And not even Biblical literalists actually believe in a literal reading of the Bible.

Creationists do a bit of selective reading when they determine what is true.\n \nSo incidentally it has nothing to do with science.\n\n It was a reaction to science that was found to conflict with their belief in mythology.\n \nThird, intelligent design, which (you may be surprised to know) doesn't come bundled with creationism all the time, WAS created in an effort to defend creationism for the attacks of the scientific theories by fighting fire with fire, so to speak.\n\n If ID creationism doesn't come bundled with creationism, then how can it logically be an effort to defend creationism? By the way, scientific theories do not attack the mythology of religion. That's a bit like claiming that reality is an attack on creationism.

   " \n\n \n I think Ken Miller has said it best. Here's his account of an encounter with creationist Henry Morris, the morning after a debate the two of them had in Tampa. It's found in Chapter 6 of Miller's Finding Darwin's God. Boldface added by me.\n \n --------------------\n \n < As luck would have it, the organizers of this event had booked rooms for both Dr. Morris and myself in a local motel. When I walked into the coffee shop the next morning, I noticed Morris at a table by himself finishing breakfast. Flushed with confidence from the debate, I asked if I might join him. The elderly Morris was a bit shaken, but he agreed. I ordered a nice breakfast, and then got right to the point. \"Do you actually believe all this stuff?\"\n \n < I suppose I might have expected a wink and a nod. We had both been paid for our debate appearances, and perhaps I expected him to acknowledge that he made a pretty good living from the creation business. He did nothing of the sort. Henry Morris made it clear to me that he believed everything he had said the night before. \"But Dr. Morris, so much of what you argued is wrong, starting with the age of the earth.\" Morris had been unable to answer the geological data on the earth's age I had presented the night before, and it had badly damaged his credibility with the audience. Nonetheless, he looked me straight in the eyes. \"Ken, you're intelligent, you're well-meaning, and you're energetic. But you are also young, and you don't realize what's at stake. In a question of such importance, scientific data aren't the ultimate authority. Even you know that science is wrong sometimes.\"\n \n < Indeed I did. Morris continued so that I could get a feeling for what that ultimate authority was. \"Scripture tells us what the right conclusion is. And if science, momentarily, doesn't agree with it, then we have to keep working until we get the right answer. But I have no doubts as to what that answer will be.\" Morris then excused himself, and I was left to ponder what he had said. I had sat down thinking the man was a charlatan, but I left appreciating the depth, the power, and the sincerity of his convictions. Nonetheless, however one might admire Morris's strength of character, convictions that allow science to be bent beyond recognition are not merely unjustified - they are dangerous in the intellectual and even in the moral sense, because they corrupt and compromise the integrity of human reason.\n \n < My impromptu breakfast with Henry Morris taught me an important lesson - the appeal of creationism is emotional, not scientific. I might be able to lay out graphs and charts and diagrams, to cite laboratory experiments and field observations, to describe the details of one evolutionary sequence after another, but to the true believers of creationism, these would all be sound and fury, signifying nothing. The truth would always be somewhere else.\n \n --------------------\n \n Based on my personal experiences -- I've lived primarily in the American midwest and south -- this pretty well somes up the general view of creationists. They are quite sincere.\n \n The problem is, they are starting from a different point of departure than the scientific. They don't start with questions. They start with scripture, which gives them the answer in advance. (Look at Morris's comment to Miller.) They've already got the conclusion, and they're just looking for the evidence that backs it up. I can't think of anything less scientific than that!\n \n And the reason why it's hard to snap them out of it is, as Miller notes, the appeal is emotional. Scripture is really important to them, because in their view, it's the word of God -- who are they to question Him? and who do those evolutionists think they are? It's intellectual authoritarianism.\n \n I submit this is also why they call evolution a \"religion\" and describe the rejection of creationism from peer reviewed scientific journals in terms of the legitimating actions of authorities. A classic case of projection; they ascribe their own authoritarian tendencies to others.\n \n So for me, a big part of the question is, how do you get someone to abandon external authorities and think for themselves? Even asking them to do so is a challenge to the authority that, per the problem, they already accept. And that makes it pretty difficult.",

   "It's kind of like how Iraqis are still afraid of Saddam Hussein. The mention of his name makes their heart rates speed up because of the guilt they feel for all the negative Saddam rhetoric that floats around. They were brainwashed all their lives.\n \n Much the same, any lean towards the trust in a science that suggests God isn't real scares the hell out of a believer. They know the logic makes sense, but they're afraid to believe it. This of course requires a very real belief in their religion.\n \n As far as the money grubbing goes, this is real too and it also requires it's victims to be real believers. It's a problem.\n\n \n yea dude totally. thats why they will use their infallibility tactics to defend themselves. if they had any logical arguments, they wouldnt need to proclaim the infallibility of God.\n \n but the funny thing about creationism is that they do make scientific claims, their claims are fallible and can be refuted and have been refuted. regardless of being proven utterly wrong, they persist and try to justify that their ideas which are scientifically wrong are actually correct. this is the one thing that grinds my gears the most about creationism, they cant accept defeat upon being completely defeated. and they will never accept defeat because they KNOW theyre right because of religious convictions. they arent in the business of furthering scientific discovery, so worming their way into the science curriculum may essentially put a stop to biological study all together. why not focus on doing what they do - pressuring everyone to give money to very very rich people - and let scientists do the things that they do? why not let these two conflicting views live apart from each other?",

Enjoy\n\n Perhaps you should go back and read what you said. It seems that you, like all creationists, change your argument after the fact.\n \nFirst, creationism pre-dates Darwin, so its purpose is totally independent of evolution whatsoever.\n\n It does not. As I pointed out:\n \nThat's just not true. The christian belief in the creation of the universe from nothing by a mythical, supernatural being may predate Darwin, but \"creationism\" was actually a rejection of Darwinism that arose in the 1920s.\n\n Explain to me how I am repeating what you said.\n \nSecond, creation is supported by the literalist interpretation of the bible, which is believed by christians who regard the bible as inerrant and completely true. So incidentally it has nothing to do with science.\n\n And again, I corrected your misunderstanding of history:\n \nBut a literalistic interpretation of the Bible was rejected or amended by believing christians long before Darwin sailed in the Beagle. The literalistic interpretation of the Bible is somewhat recent.\n\n Biblical literalism arose with the growth of christian fundamentalism in the early 20th century. It had everything to do with science since it was a religious rejection of the findings of science, most especially, biology, genetics, paleontology, geology, etc.\n \nThird, intelligent design, which (you may be surprised to know) doesn't come bundled with creationism all the time, WAS created in an effort to defend creationism for the attacks of the scientific theories by fighting fire with fire, so to speak.\n\n Let me again point out the internal contradiction of your statement. If intelligent design, the purpose of which was to defend creationism from \"attacks\" by scientific theories, then how can it not be \"bundled\" with creationism. ID is creationism pretending to be science. So said a fundamentalist christian federal district court judge.\n \n Perhaps your abilities to communicate are lacking and what you said didn't actually represent what you believe. But what I said was not by any stretch just repeating what you said.\n \n Stand up and support what you said or admit that you misspoke. But please don't pretend that I merely repeated what you said.

   "I thought of beginning a new thread for this, but then considered that it fits right here, as an example of the contorted logic of creationists.\n \n Creationists argue that all of the constants of physics are fine tuned to create a world that is perfect for us. They argue that if any one of the constants of physics were different then the universe, as we know it, would not exist. They conclude (in fact they offer this as \"proof\") that the universe was designed by a magical being for the express purpose of supporting us.\n \n But how is it then possible that creationists also argue, when faced by stellar objects that are billions of light years away, and radioactive elements that decay in half-lives that far exceed the creationist belief in the age of the universe, offer the explanation that these fine tuned constants have changed. Distant stellar objects only appear so because the speed of light has changed. Or the rates of radio decay are now slower because of changes in atmospheric or chemical environments.\n \n So, how is it that all of the laws of nature that were specified to be exactly what was needed for us were somehow different for the first 1500 years of human existance?",

No proponent of intelligent design can defend creation in 7 literal days, nor the garden of Eden, for example, which are fundamental creationist beliefs. Intelligent design boils down to giving credit to God for the amazing wonders of the observable universe, and often has very little biblical correlation.

   "id like to start with your comment on me going to church. as a matter of fact, i, just like many other atheists grew up in a moderately christian family. i have been to church and i rejected that way of life LONG before i knew anything about evolution. it was my skepticism that brought me to science in the first place, not the other way around. dont make assumptions, they may be wrong. speaking of wrong, have i just proven you wrong for the first time? oh wait, youve been wrong dozens of times on these very forums.\n\n \n 1. Not all churches teach the truth (or even the Bible at all).\n \n 2. Just because you went does not mean you know much about it. I know many people in my church that have little or no knowledge of the Bible outside John 3:16.\n \n \nsorry, in canada we dont have this supposed NRB channel, but i have watched a lot of shows on evolution, and am a huge fan of Dawkins - honestly, you cant get your knowledge about evolution from watching TV.\n\n \n Are you saying they lie about evolution on TV?\n \n \nalso, youre still convinced that i dont think for myself and just listen to authority. how many times do i have to say, the evidence for evolution is made public. i am certain that every natural history museum has some sort of evidence for evolution - most are filled to the ceiling with it. i dont put any trust into anyone, i can just go and have a look at it and make my own assumptions. but lets talk about authority. science is structured around evidence and reason. religion on the other hand (and this includes creationism and ID) is structured around authority, money and lies. i am the one listening to authority when i look at the evidence for evolution, and you are the one making up your own mind when going to church and listening to some guy tell you what to do? no, wrong again.\n\n \n Your \"authority\" is evolutionists that are as indoctrinated as you are that can be corrupted by money; they are the ones who create you \"evidence and reason\". Public information about evolution is still just nonsequitor conclusions and misleading discoveries that you accept at face value. When was the last time you questioned it? When have you sat down with one of these scientists and asked how they came up with these things? When have you ever done research into something (not a book of theirs, but actual scientific process) by yourself instead of letting others tell you what is fact?\n \n My authority is the inerrant Bible. Amazingly enough, a book does not change to make a profit. It even tells people to never take a religious teacher at face value.\n \n\n i will not admit something that is false - that evolution is a faith based area of study, that would be a false statement. but you know what? fk it. if you wont take it upon yourself to go searching for the thing you hold such a strong position against, ill do it myself - just to get the ball rolling.\n \n you are aware of viruses right? lets say, influenza. a new flu vaccine is out every year, and at first this doesnt make any sense. if we are injected with the flu shot once, our bodies should produce antibodies and we will become immune to influenza, but influenza is one step ahead. the flu shot will kill almost all of the influenza virus, but influenza is highly variable. that means a select few of these viruses have adapted an immunity to our immunity to them. this results in a new strain (or a genetic variance) of influenza each year, as the ones without the resistance to the vaccine get killed off and the ones with it continue to multiply. you can see this rapid evolution under a microscope, fart. there is no room for argument. this is one of literally thousands of examples i could give for evidence of evolution, but id like to hear what you have to say about this. \n\n \n This is an example of a false conclusion. Do you know how viruses reproduce? They inject their DNA into a host cell. The resulting new viruses are not identical to the parent. This is in no way \"evolution\". The cells they have injected their DNA into are not identical to eachother either so when it is corrupted and taken over by a virus, the viral DNA comes out differently according to the differing cell and differing virus. \n \n With your thought process, if a guy has a child and he dies of a hereditary disease, but his child is immune, then it must be evolution. I do not think you would seriously come to that conclusion, but that is because you adapt ideas to say what you want them to say.\n \n \noh, and if you claim that there is a hidden TV screen inside the microscope that shows a video of evolution happening, youre hopeless. hopeless to learning.\n\n \n And if you think people stared at something long enough to see it evolve, you are kidding yourself.\n \n \n \n \n By the way, I am willing to accept anything you would like me to pray for you about.",

   "Show me where I have been refuted.\n\n \n Fartingle, it's happened repeatedly, in the various posts made in response to you, time and again. The fact that you don't recognize it doesn't mean it hasn't happened.\n \n \nPeople have given their opinion on why they think I am wrong, but they eventually drop the subject when they see no way to win.\n\n \n Who's giving up, exactly? I don't see people leaving the place in droves!\n \n \nBy \"obvious\" I mean that a small bit of logical thought can uncover the flaw.\n\n \n But I haven't seen you employing the tools of logic -- even \"small\" tools, employed briefly -- to show where people have gone wrong. To the contrary, I have seen you make ad hominem attacks about the intellectual properties of your opponents (e.g. that they just follow the authority of their teachers) -- and ad hominem argumentation is itself logically fallacious; or juxtapose counter-assertions to what evolutionists claim, without showing where their claims failed and where yours succeed; or make declarations by fiat that there is no evidence, regardless of what sources are referenced for you to consider; or etc, etc.\n \n I've taught college-level logic many times, and I don't see you using logic here. To the contrary, I see you committing serious argumentative mistakes, repeatedly.\n \n \nI only believe things about the Bible that the Bible itself says.\n\n \n The Bible says very little about itself! 2 Timothy famously contains the line that \"all scripture is god-breathed,\" for example, and this is often interpreted by inerrantists as the justification for inerrancy. But why is this the meaning?\n \n To call scripture \"god-breathed\" can also be interpreted as divine inspiration, and there is no necessary reason why such divine inspiration obviates human infallibility. The text itself doesn't claim so, please note. So the inerrantist interpretation does not rest on what \"the Bible itself says,\" but on something else.\n \n You are, I'm afraid, cutting yourself off from a richer understanding of the Bible, and what it says, by attempting to understand it from an internal-only perspective -- a perspective that is nowhere demanded within the Bible itself, and which neither Jewish nor Christian scholars have ever employed (even if some of them have pretended to do so).\n \n \nI used to go to a christian school and I would correct the teacher in Bible class.\n\n \n Why didn't you just teach the class?...\n \n \nLike I said before, I have intentionally watched science shows about evolution (and the big bang) so that I would know the other side.\n\n \n Do you really think that watching some TV shows about evolution and the Big Bang qualifies as serious study?\n \n I saw a TV show on Jesus a while back, pertaining to the claims made in the da Vinci code. Various strands of evidence were brought together to justify the idea that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene, while contrary evidence and arguments were offered to criticize it. Very interesting! Does having watched this and similar programs make me an expert on the life of Jesus?\n \n Come now. At the very least, it could be said that books are a better way to go. Better still is serious study, undertaken with a charitably open-minded attitude, even though one may ulitmately come to reject what one has in the process come to understand.\n \n Here are a pair of books I highly recommend: Francis Collins, The Language of God; Ken Miller, Finding Darwin's God. Both men are devout Christians, Miller being Catholic and Collins being an evangelical. Both are also practicing biologists who accept that life on Earth has evolved. Their books criticize creationist rejections of evolution, but also what they consider misguided derivations of atheism from evolution; instead, the two attempt to reconcile religion and science.\n \n They are hardly the only people to undertake such projects, but they are two of the best. Collins' book in particular is very accessible. I encourage you to explore them.\n \n After I pointed out that your approach was ad hominem. You responded:\n \n \nNot at all. It was Bennedict that made the assumption that I have no knowledge of evolution. I merely pointed out that it is he who has no knowledge of the opposing arguement.\n\n \n You appear to have misunderstood. What I was labeling \"ad hominem\" was something quite specific: you were going after Bennedict for just following the authority of his evolutionist teachers. This is a claim about Bennedict, not his statements or arguments, and it has no relevance whatsoever to the truth of those statements or the validity of those arguments. It's irrelevant -- and a perfect example of ad hominem argumentation (which is often far more subtle than just insulting or demonizing someone).\n \n \nAccording to evolution, you shouldn't [care what convinces you]. Argueing is a waste of time in your 25,000 days of existence (on average).\n\n \n Suppose -- if only for the sake of argument -- that evolution is true. Why would this imply that arguing is a waste of time? I need your argument for this, please.\n \n \n...the \"evidence\" for evolution is so full of holes that it cannot convince me\n\n \n It is very easy to describe a body of evidence as \"full of holes\" when one isn't familiar with most of it!...\n \n \nConsidering the fact that I do not believe in an old earth, why would I think those measures are accurate?\n\n \n You don't have to. It's why I made the comment about \"apparent age,\" rather than real age. Henry Morris, the leading exponent of creationism, made this point long ago. Creationist geologist Marcus Ross uses it all the time.\n \n And if the apparent age of a rock was 1 billion years old, but it contained a fossilized rabbit, I'd rethink things entirely.\n \n \n[Only] Nothingness after [your] death [could convince you that you are wrong about creationism].\n \n Considering that is the only possible outcome for everyone (according to evolution/ atheism), why are you trying to convince me I am wrong?\n\n \n But of course, I believe that arguments during one's life have the potential to sway people. So of course I'm arguing with you!\n \n Since only evidence that's available after death could dissuade or confirm your current belief, I'd think the better question is, why are you arguing?\n \n In any event, I do encourage you to check out those books I mentioned. Evolution is compatible with atheism, to be sure. It does not, however, require atheism, and both Collins and Miller are excellent cases in point.",

Scientists make things up to get money because they are greedy just like every other person on the planet. They have absolutely no need to fear losing their career because they are presenting things to a \"scientific community\" that already believes evolution and gladly welcomes anything that seems like it maybe supports it a little in some way. Scientists certainly live better than most people I know. \n \n Churches do not make money. My pastor recently had to sell his house because he could no longer pay for it. The only way money comes in is by optional tithing which is barely enough to pay for the building. Everyone that works there also has another job.\n \n What you are thinking of are most likely \"mega-churches\" which are so far off in their teaching that they can hardly be called \"churches\". These usually have other sources of income.\n \n \nscientific theories do not change to make a profit, they change to be more accurate to what we have found. science. learn about it. the churches misquote the bible to make it appropriate for our society so people will think that its good and join the church so they can give money to very very rich people.\n\n \n They only change when the holes in their theories have become too obvious. They will never fully fix them, of course, because a lie can always be found out.\n \n I really cannot believe that you are so foolish as to believe that churches are run by extremely wealthy people... You obviously are trying a \"guilt by association\" tactic based on a lie and it saddens me to think that you are barely capable of rational arguement any longer.\n \n \nheres the big one - you messed up big time with viruses. a variation in the virus population is essential for evolution to work, fortunately even you acknowledge this variation from the \"parent\" (it actually is not a parent, but oh well). the flu \"children\" who do not have a resistance to this year's vaccine get killed off leaving only the ones with the resistance. these viruses multiply and a new strain of the virus is all set up for next year. their genetics then carry the resistance and all other offspring have it the following year. the genotype has been modified by natural selection to be resistant to each year's vaccines after the flu season is up.\n\n \n Yet that absolutely does not mean that it evolved. It is simple genetics in reproduction. If you have brown eyes and your wife has blue eyes it is still possible for your child to have green eyes without \"evolution\" (trust me, There are six kids in my family with four different eye colors including brown, hazel, blue, and gray). Like I said before, it is a simple matter of creating a conclusion that is not actually related to what is happening.\n \n \noh, but guess what? you messed up even bigger time in this hereditary scenario. if a guy dies of a genetic disease but his son doesnt have it, the son is NOT immune to the diesase, depending on the dominance of the allele, lets say its a recessive allele, the son is either homozygous dominant or heterozygous. thats the thing about hereditary diseases, theyre hereditary. research. do it before making yourself look like a fool.\n\n \n Maybe I did not make myself clear, but I did mean that the child does get the disease but does not die which would cause the immunity.\n \n \nyou can see the evolution of viruses in the body, not if you look at it long enough, if you look at it before and after flu seasons, you will see a genetic modification in the virus, and that is evolution by natural selection.\n\n \n Again, it is not evolution but genetics. The same way we see varying traits in parents and children. The vaccine does not kill every single virus one year and it does not kill zero the next. It is more like a \"best fit line\" kind of killer if you understand my meaning. It kills the majority by being based on the current center of entropy. \n \n Random medical pondering- I do not know of anyone ever seeing if a vaccine could be used more than a year later (perhaps the immunity goes in a cycle?)\n \n Also I am serious about the prayer requests.",

To the contrary, I see you committing serious argumentative mistakes, repeatedly.\n\n \n I honestly doubt that a college course teaches the Creation vs. evolution dynamic. Having never taken such a class, I cannot be certain.\n \n \nThe Bible says very little about itself! 2 Timothy famously contains the line that \"all scripture is god-breathed,\" for example, and this is often interpreted by inerrantists as the justification for inerrancy. But why is this the meaning?\n\n \n Tell me, Have you yourself actually read the Bible? Not just a few passages that people have told you about, but in its entirety? If you have than you should quickly realize that you are incorrect.\n \n The Old Testament talks about the history of Israel, establishes laws for the Isrealites, and makes hundreds of prophecies about Christ. The New Testament Jesus fulfills all of the prophecies (except those pertaining to the end times) and the Law. Most people do not understand \"fulfilling the Law\" so I will clarify: O.T. Law (not the 10 commandments) was created to keep the Israelites clean and sinless, the actual cleansing of sins was done by sacrificing an innocent animal, Jesus was perfect and sinless so he became that sacrifice except that His is forever so O.T. law and sacrifice no longer need to be done.\n \n In no place does the Bible contradict itself. I have heard the pseudo-contradictions and can answer them if need be.\n \n \nTo call scripture \"god-breathed\" can also be interpreted as divine inspiration, and there is no necessary reason why such divine inspiration obviates human infallibility. The text itself doesn't claim so, please note. So the inerrantist interpretation does not rest on what \"the Bible itself says,\" but on something else.\n\n \n Actually that is once again narrowing your knowledge of the Bible to a single verse. John 1:1 says, \" In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God.\" The Bible is God's word and not man's. Also the Bible does not allow for human thought to corrupt it; if it did, then \"holy men\"'s words would also be absolute, but Paul said \"Do not believe what I teach you, but search the Scriptures to check that I am without corruption.\"\n \n (by the way, I am very bad at memorizing all the references so if you want to know them then you will have to look them up.)\n \n \nYou are, I'm afraid, cutting yourself off from a richer understanding of the Bible, and what it says, by attempting to understand it from an internal-only perspective -- a perspective that is nowhere demanded within the Bible itself, and which neither Jewish nor Christian scholars have ever employed (even if some of them have pretended to do so).\n\n \n You are cutting yourself off from a richer understanding of the Bible by not knowing what it says to begin with.\n \n It certainly does demand it. It says, \"There will come a day where men will no longer endure sound teaching; but, wishing to have their ears tickled, they will raise up false teachers for themselves.\" If someone is teaching something outside of what the Bible says and calls it God's word, they are a liar (EX. Jim Jones, the pope, and Joseph Smith).\n \n \nWhy didn't you just teach the class?...\n\n \n I pretty much would when I was outside the class. I probably would have gotten kicked out if I called them out every time. I was very concerned that my classmates were being taught wrong.\n \n \nDo you really think that watching some TV shows about evolution and the Big Bang qualifies as serious study?\n\n \n I did not say that it was the only way I study evolution. Though they are accurate to what is believed by evolutionists and usually quite in depth when you piece it all together.\n \n \nI saw a TV show on Jesus a while back, pertaining to the claims made in the da Vinci code. Various strands of evidence were brought together to justify the idea that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene, while contrary evidence and arguments were offered to criticize it. Very interesting! Does having watched this and similar programs make me an expert on the life of Jesus?\n\n \n Not at all. Though you must realize that almost all types of media, especially television, absolutely lean evolution/atheist.\n \n \nCome now. At the very least, it could be said that books are a better way to go. Better still is serious study, undertaken with a charitably open-minded attitude, even though one may ulitmately come to reject what one has in the process come to understand.\n\n \n Yes, but you see, I have read books and I cannot seriously study something that is already full of errors and gaps except to find who created them and how.\n \n \nHere are a pair of books I highly recommend: Francis Collins, The Language of God; Ken Miller, Finding Darwin's God. Both men are devout Christians, Miller being Catholic and Collins being an evangelical. Both are also practicing biologists who accept that life on Earth has evolved. Their books criticize creationist rejections of evolution, but also what they consider misguided derivations of atheism from evolution; instead, the two attempt to reconcile religion and science.\n \n They are hardly the only people to undertake such projects, but they are two of the best. Collins' book in particular is very accessible. I encourage you to explore them.\n\n \n *sigh* My grandfather is an OEC person too so I know alot of what they will say, but it is really people that want to invalidate 1 part of the Bible so they can begin to pick away at the parts they do not agree with.\n \n \n \n \nAfter I pointed out that your approach was ad hominem. You responded:\n \n \n \n You appear to have misunderstood. What I was labeling \"ad hominem\" was something quite specific: you were going after Bennedict for just following the authority of his evolutionist teachers. This is a claim about Bennedict, not his statements or arguments, and it has no relevance whatsoever to the truth of those statements or the validity of those arguments. It's irrelevant -- and a perfect example of ad hominem argumentation (which is often far more subtle than just insulting or demonizing someone).\n\n \n I think I already answered this somewhere. I am not calling him wrong for that (not yet at least. It's a process.), I am just showing him that evolution is a faith system that only has faith that those who teach it are correct and telling the truth.\n \n \nSuppose -- if only for the sake of argument -- that evolution is true. Why would this imply that arguing is a waste of time? I need your argument for this, please.\n\n \n Because there would be nothing after death for either of us. Life would be all there is so we better enjoy it while we can. Me being convinced that it is true helps no one in a positive way. Why take time out of your severely limited life to do something that not only helps nobody, but even (at least for most people) makes you upset and frustrated?\n \n \nIt is very easy to describe a body of evidence as \"full of holes\" when one isn't familiar with most of it!...\n\n \n Again, we are now starting the process of Bennedict presenting evidence and I will show why it does not prove evolution.\n \n \nYou don't have to. It's why I made the comment about \"apparent age,\" rather than real age. Henry Morris, the leading exponent of creationism, made this point long ago. Creationist geologist Marcus Ross uses it all the time.\n \n And if the apparent age of a rock was 1 billion years old, but it contained a fossilized rabbit, I'd rethink things entirely.\n\n \n Ok then, if I find one I will let you know.\n \n \nBut of course, I believe that arguments during one's life have the potential to sway people. So of course I'm arguing with you!\n \n Since only evidence that's available after death could dissuade or confirm your current belief, I'd think the better question is, why are you arguing?\n\n \n Ah, I think I have answered this but I would like you to know. According to what I believe, those who do not accept Jesus Christ as their savior while on earth will burn for all eternity in Hell (have you ever contemplated how long eternity is?). I do my best to convince you to accept Him because I have absolutely no desire to see anyone go to Hell. I am not cruel enough to let you walk down the path to destruction. My only chance to save you from suffering is in this life.\n \n \nIn any event, I do encourage you to check out those books I mentioned. Evolution is compatible with atheism, to be sure. It does not, however, require atheism, and both Collins and Miller are excellent cases in point.\n\n \n I may look those up if I can.",

   "Tell me, Have you yourself actually read the Bible? Not just a few passages that people have told you about, but in its entirety?\n\n \n Multiple times in its entirety. My father is a Methodist minister. He rejects the literal interpretation of the Bible, incidentally, and accepts the Big Bang and evolution.\n \n \nIf you have than you should quickly realize that you are incorrect.\n\n \n Sorry, but it's not as simple as that. There are multiple interpretations possible. You can't just point to the text and have done with it.\n \n \nIn no place does the Bible contradict itself. I have heard the pseudo-contradictions and can answer them if need be.\n\n \n Then explain to me the contradiction between the orders of creation in Genesis 1 and Genesis 2. The first puts Adam last, along with Eve. The second puts Adam first, with Eve coming after the other animals fail as companions.\n \n I've seen it claimed that one of these provides a temporal order, while the other explores the relation of man to God. To which I can only say, where does the text itself say such a thing? On what scriptural basis does such an interpretation -- for it is an interpretation -- rest? Hint: There ain't one. The only reason to dissolve this contradiction is to presume a priori that such a thing is impossible.\n \n The attempt ignores completely the divergent authorship of the two chapters in question, Mosaic authorship being a long-established but also long-disproved tradition. Amazing what a little sound historical research can do for one's understanding.\n \n Does this contradiction mean that Genesis has no value? No! I have no quarrel with theism, though I'm no longer a theist myself. I just have problems with Biblical literalism.\n \n \nActually that is once again narrowing your knowledge of the Bible to a single verse.\n\n \n I see. So, if someone only quotes a single verse or passage, should I presume that's all they know? I think not.\n \n \nJohn 1:1 says, \" In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God.\"\n\n \n As scholarly work has recognized for centuries, \"the Word\" in question is Jesus, the person of the Son. Even at the outset, \"the Word\" is referenced as \"He.\" Meanwhile, just in case the reader missed it in the preceding discussion, John 1:14 makes it very clear just who is being talked about<b></b>: \"And the Word became flesh and lived among us, and we have seen his glory, the glory as of a father's only son, full of grace and truth.\" John 1:16-18 continue this line of reasoning.\n \n The Bible is not the Word of God. Jesus is.\n \n \nThe Bible is God's word [sic] and not man's. Also the Bible does not allow for human thought to corrupt it...\n\n \n And the only reason to believe this is an a priori leap of faith.\n \n \n...if it did, then \"holy men\"'s words would also be absolute...\n\n \n This makes no sense. \"If the Bible allowed for human thought to corrupt the Bible, then holy men's words would also be absolute.\" Huh?\n \n \n...but Paul said \"Do not believe what I teach you, but search the Scriptures to check that I am without corruption.\"\n\n \n Which is circular, because it presumes that scriptures themselves are without corruption\n \n \nYou are cutting yourself off from a richer understanding of the Bible by not knowing what it says to begin with.\n\n \n Sorry, but that claim is simply false. I know very well what it says. The fact that I dissagree with you doesn't mean otherwise.\n \n \nIt certainly does demand it. It says, \"There will come a day where men will no longer endure sound teaching; but, wishing to have their ears tickled, they will raise up false teachers for themselves.\"\n\n \n You show me where that verse -- 2 Timothy 4:3 -- says, \"The Bible is only to be understood from an internal perspective.\"\n \n \n If someone is teaching something outside of what the Bible says and calls it God's word, they are a liar\n\n \n You just did. The verse in question does not say anything about looking only to the Bible. It merely refers to \"sound teaching.\" Nor do the verses that make up the immediate context -- 2 Timothy 4:1-5 -- refer to the Bible, or even to \"scripture\" (the Bible itself not having been finalized at the time of writing).\n \n You, Fartingle, have just \"[taught] something outside of what the Bible says and [called] it God's word. Which presumably means...\n \n \n(EX. Jim Jones, the pope, and Joseph Smith).\n\n \n ...that per your own stated position, there's at least one more name to add to that list.\n \n \nI pretty much would when I was outside the class. I probably would have gotten kicked out if I called them out every time. I was very concerned that my classmates were being taught wrong.\n\n \n What an attitude. Wonko the Sane would be proud.\n \n \nThough you must realize that almost all types of media, especially television, absolutely lean evolution/atheist.\n\n \n I \"realize\" no such thing. In part, this is because \"evolutionist\" and \"atheist\" are not interchangeable terms.\n \n \n...I cannot seriously study something that is already full of errors and gaps except to find who created them and how.\n\n \n Why not take the opportunity to look at what the evidence is, instead? Go in with an open mind, and start tracking stuff down.\n \n Know why I'm now an evolutionist? Because I heard some creationist arguments that actually sounded good to me once. I looked and said, \"What is the evidence for the so-called fountains of the deep?\" \"What are the odds?\" \"What is the issue with irreducible complexity?\" Etc. I read my Morris, read my Johnson, read my Behe, and more, because I thought they should be taken seriously.\n \n Then, I read the other side, and what I found was, the evidence and arguments offered by the creationist side of the argument just didn't hold up to scrutiny. The evidentiary claims are often just wrong, and there are leaps of logic in the arugmentation.\n \n But don't take my word for it. Just read the books -- even if you're first inclined to disagree -- with an open mind: try to figure out whether they might be right, rather than just assuming from the get-go that they are wrong.\n \n \nit is really people that want to invalidate 1 part of the Bible so they can begin to pick away at the parts they do not agree with.\n\n \n Two things. First, the choice here is not all or nothing. If there are parts of the Bible that are inaccurate, this does not mean that all of it is. If there are parts that have no connection to historical events, this does not mean that none of it does.\n \n Second, rejection of literalism is not necessarily rejection of Christianity as such. It may well be the case that -- as many Christians have said -- there is a difference between literal and spiritual truth, such that the Bible could express the latter while lacking the former. Genesis, for example, can be taken as an expression of ideas such as: all things depend on God for their existence; in relation to God, all things are good; God loves his creation, including humankind; humans are imperfect and in need of God; and so forth. These ideas can be true, even if the narrative that expresses them is entirely fictive!\n \n And there is certainly nothing about either the Big Bang or evolution that ipso facto invalidates those ideas, either. The Big Bang or evolution don't require those other ideas, I grant you. But they're consistent with a variety of metaphysical views, including theism.\n \n \nI am just showing him that evolution is a faith system that only has faith that those who teach it are correct and telling the truth.\n\n \n But that's not true. Evolution starts from a set of observable data and makes inferences about how best to explain it. Faith is something else entirely.\n \n \nBecause there would be nothing after death for either of us. Life would be all there is so we better enjoy it while we can. Me being convinced that it is true helps no one in a positive way. Why take time out of your severely limited life to do something that not only helps nobody, but even (at least for most people) makes you upset and frustrated?\n\n \n But none of this is implied by evolution, or even by atheism. They don't require hedonism, they don't require selfishness. Study a little bit of philosophy sometime.\n \n Personally, I think that creationism is harmful, during this life -- for non-creationists who get in their way many times, but even for creationists themselves, who frequently display signs of being very unhappy with their lives (if I may say). I believe we have moral obligations to help one another: obligations which are rooted in our social biology, which are discernible through the use of reason, and which (you'll be happy to know) are even consistent with many of the teachings of traditional Christianity. Hence, when I see people in trouble (of one sort or another), I believe it is a duty to help them, even at some cost to myself.\n \n \nAccording to what I believe, those who do not accept Jesus Christ as their savior while on earth will burn for all eternity in Hell (have you ever contemplated how long eternity is?).\n\n \n I have. Wrote a paper about \"eternity\" way back in graduate school.

My point is that Bennedict's example is a simple process that we see every day that scientists have falsly concluded to be evolution.\n\n \n Except that his example incorporates differential survival and reproduction over time, based on the heritable variations that come to be. That is entirely different from what you proposed in your example, and that's evolution.\n \n \nIt is not evolution. There is no new species being created...\n\n \n Here seem to be committing a very common mistake. If a population takes on new properties over time, such that its members are now different than they were before, is it the same species, or a new one?...\n \n You're treating evolution as if it said: now one species, now another -- as if there were a hard and fast dividing line between them.

Some of \"them\" are immune, and others of them aren't. But when considering which of \"them\" are immune, their descendents are more likely to survive.\n \n You have to stop thinking in \"lump\" terms, where the viruses are just \"them.\" There are different lineages of the virus, and not all of those lineages do equally well at surviving into the future.",

If it was scrapped then you would not hear about it. \n \n You really like to cling to those things as if they are the one source of absolute truth.\n \n \nthe fact that the population of influenza changes its genetic code in response to natural selection IS evolution happening!!! and it happens every year. thats what im trying to tell you. genetic variation in a population which gets filtered by natural selection is exactly what evolution is all about.\n\n \n So now you are saying that they change their DNA in because of natural selection? Alright so they see their deaths coming and so they voluntarily change their DNA to survive. Not only that but they plan to do it annually. No, evolution is not a garaunteed process in every single generation so it cannot happen in a constant schedule. A vaccine is also not \"natural selection. It is completely unnatural.\n \n \nyou seem to get the genetic variation part, so ill explain the natural selection part again: each year's vaccine creates antibodies which will kill x number of these influenza viruses. the ones that are left obviously have a resistance to the vaccine and they are able to reproduce, thus spawning a new strain of influenza with the same genetic information that codes for the immunity to every year's vaccine. so, scientists have to come up with a new vaccine every year to kill x number of influenza again. you see, natural selection is changing the genetic information of the populus each year.\n\n \n Besides a vaccine not at all being natural selection, an enormous number of flu viruses are never subjected to it. According to evolution, those that are immune to the vaccine also will have many other variances. Including those never killed by the vaccine but only by a body's natural process, the entropy in DNA variances of viruses will continue to become greater and greater until vaccines become useless altogether because there is no way it can be effective against so many different viruses. \n \n \nagain, you said the child has an immunity to the genetic disease. he does NOT! if he is a homozygous dominant with no symptoms (the disease would be recessive), he has no possibility of transferring the disease to his children. if he is heterzygous, he is a carrier and that means his children may have the disease. like i said, inherited traits are inherited. there is no resistance or immunity to an inherited trait.\n\n \n Wrong. My great grandfather died of prostate cancer. My grandfather did not get it but my dad did. We could not afford to get it checked out, but he has recovered almost completely by himself.\n \n \nthe genetic modifications of influenza is not the same as a child inheriting aspects of his parents. the variation part yes, but natural selection changes the genetic frequency within the population, and thats not whats happening with inheritance.\n\n \n The vaccine is still not natural selection.",

   "Multiple times in its entirety. My father is a Methodist minister. He rejects the literal interpretation of the Bible, incidentally, and accepts the Big Bang and evolution.\n\n \n No offense to your father, but Methodism is dumb. To say you believe the Bible while throwing most of it out to get it to say what you want it to say makes no sense. \n \n Both of you read the Bible with your own hermeneutic of it being allegorical. You can reject a literal interpretation all you want, but it will not stop it from being literal\n \n \nSorry, but it's not as simple as that. There are multiple interpretations possible. You can't just point to the text and have done with it.\n\n \n So you have been told and so you desperately wish, but you are wrong.\n \n \nThen explain to me the contradiction between the orders of creation in Genesis 1 and Genesis 2. The first puts Adam last, along with Eve. The second puts Adam first, with Eve coming after the other animals fail as companions.\n \n I've seen it claimed that one of these provides a temporal order, while the other explores the relation of man to God. To which I can only say, where does the text itself say such a thing? On what scriptural basis does such an interpretation -- for it is an interpretation -- rest? Hint: There ain't one. The only reason to dissolve this contradiction is to presume a priori that such a thing is impossible.\n \n The attempt ignores completely the divergent authorship of the two chapters in question, Mosaic authorship being a long-established but also long-disproved tradition. Amazing what a little sound historical research can do for one's understanding.\n \n Does this contradiction mean that Genesis has no value? No! I have no quarrel with theism, though I'm no longer a theist myself. I just have problems with Biblical literalism.\n\n \n I am sorry but re-read the beginning Genesis 2. Have you ever read a novel before? It is not re-giving the account of creation; it is setting the scene for a story (a literal one (you cannot seem to identify those)). It also never says a time that he created the animals. It talks about man being in the garden then says in verse 19, \"Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the beasts of the field and all the birds of the air.\" It does not say \"then formed\".\n \n \nI see. So, if someone only quotes a single verse or passage, should I presume that's all they know? I think not.\n\n \n If someone quotes a verse out of context and with a hermeneutic all their own, then yes.\n \n \nAs scholarly work has recognized for centuries, \"the Word\" in question is Jesus, the person of the Son. Even at the outset, \"the Word\" is referenced as \"He.\" Meanwhile, just in case the reader missed it in the preceding discussion, John 1:14 makes it very clear just who is being talked about<b></b>: \"And the Word became flesh and lived among us, and we have seen his glory, the glory as of a father's only son, full of grace and truth.\" John 1:16-18 continue this line of reasoning.\n \n The Bible is not the Word of God. Jesus is.\n\n \n Both are. There are 2 different words in the Greek language that mean \"word\". The word that is used here is \"LOGOS\" which is also used when referring to the scriptures. At the time it was written, the scriptures was only the Old Testament. Jesus was the fulfillment of the Old Testament.\n \n \nThis makes no sense. \"If the Bible allowed for human thought to corrupt the Bible, then holy men's words would also be absolute.\" Huh?\n\n \n It makes perfect sense when you think at all. Bible= believed to be absolute truth, but you add in: \"\"\"= words of men, so logically you must end with: words of men= absolute truth.\n \n \nWhich is circular, because it presumes that scriptures themselves are without corruption\n\n \n They are without corruption. They say things that man would never say about man. They have not been changed in meaning since being written.\n \n Sorry, but that claim is simply false. I know very well what it says. The fact that I dissagree with you doesn't mean otherwise.\n \n \n \n \nYou show me where that verse -- 2 Timothy 4:3 -- says, \"The Bible is only to be understood from an internal perspective.\"\n\n \n Again you are narrowing your view. That verse says that there are false teachers so do not trust all people who claim to teach it. Look also at what Paul said about not even taking an apostle or priest at their word and you will be left with \"people are not the authority in teaching what the Bible says\". The only thing left to be the authority on it is the Bible itslef.\n \n \nYou just did. The verse in question does not say anything about looking only to the Bible. It merely refers to \"sound teaching.\" Nor do the verses that make up the immediate context -- 2 Timothy 4:1-5 -- refer to the Bible, or even to \"scripture\" (the Bible itself not having been finalized at the time of writing).\n \n You, Fartingle, have just \"[taught] something outside of what the Bible says and [called] it God's word. Which presumably means...\n\n \n Hahaha, in the verses you mentioned, the beginning of verse 2 says, \"Preach the Word...\" so it definitely does refer to the Bible itself. Of course with your hermeneutic it would be saying \"Preach the Jesus\" which does not make sense\n \n \n...that per your own stated position, there's at least one more name to add to that list.\n\n \n Oh?\n \n \nWhat an attitude. Wonko the Sane would be proud.\n\n \n It is an obvious consequence of being politically correct. The school did not want to offend any students or parents by talking about things like predestination election.\n \n \nI \"realize\" no such thing. In part, this is because \"evolutionist\" and \"atheist\" are not interchangeable terms.\n\n \n I put \"evolution/atheism\" because of context. Science shows definitely lean evolution but news shows, that do not talk so much about evolution, lean atheist by bashing Christians (or just conservatives) whenever they can.\n \n \nWhy not take the opportunity to look at what the evidence is, instead? Go in with an open mind, and start tracking stuff down.\n \n Know why I'm now an evolutionist? Because I heard some creationist arguments that actually sounded good to me once. I looked and said, \"What is the evidence for the so-called fountains of the deep?\" \"What are the odds?\" \"What is the issue with irreducible complexity?\" Etc. I read my Morris, read my Johnson, read my Behe, and more, because I thought they should be taken seriously.\n \n Then, I read the other side, and what I found was, the evidence and arguments offered by the creationist side of the argument just didn't hold up to scrutiny. The evidentiary claims are often just wrong, and there are leaps of logic in the arugmentation.\n \n But don't take my word for it. Just read the books -- even if you're first inclined to disagree -- with an open mind: try to figure out whether they might be right, rather than just assuming from the get-go that they are wrong.\n\n \n But I must ask first, how exactly did they disprove such things?\n \n \nTwo things. First, the choice here is not all or nothing. If there are parts of the Bible that are inaccurate, this does not mean that all of it is. If there are parts that have no connection to historical events, this does not mean that none of it does.\n \n Second, rejection of literalism is not necessarily rejection of Christianity as such. It may well be the case that -- as many Christians have said -- there is a difference between literal and spiritual truth, such that the Bible could express the latter while lacking the former. Genesis, for example, can be taken as an expression of ideas such as: all things depend on God for their existence; in relation to God, all things are good; God loves his creation, including humankind; humans are imperfect and in need of God; and so forth. These ideas can be true, even if the narrative that expresses them is entirely fictive!\n \n And there is certainly nothing about either the Big Bang or evolution that ipso facto invalidates those ideas, either. The Big Bang or evolution don't require those other ideas, I grant you. But they're consistent with a variety of metaphysical views, including theism.\n \n \n \n But that's not true. Evolution starts from a set of observable data and makes inferences about how best to explain it. Faith is something else entirely.\n \n \n \n But none of this is implied by evolution, or even by atheism. They don't require hedonism, they don't require selfishness. Study a little bit of philosophy sometime.\n \n Personally, I think that creationism is harmful, during this life -- for non-creationists who get in their way many times, but even for creationists themselves, who frequently display signs of being very unhappy with their lives (if I may say). I believe we have moral obligations to help one another: obligations which are rooted in our social biology, which are discernible through the use of reason, and which (you'll be happy to know) are even consistent with many of the teachings of traditional Christianity. Hence, when I see people in trouble (of one sort or another), I believe it is a duty to help them, even at some cost to myself.\n \n \n \n I have. Wrote a paper about \"eternity\" way back in graduate school. It doesn't mean \"forever,\" it means \"outside time.\" Nothing original on my part, this -- it's been the meaning of eternity for literally millennia -- though it does run contrary to most people's idea. But I digress.\n \n \n \n But God is?... At least the Universalists are being consistent. They regard infinite punishment for finite misdeeds as completely incompatible with the idea of God's perfect love. I agree.\n \n \n \n But you can't save anyone -- not even yourself! Only God's grace can do that!\n \n And that is straight up Martin Luther and Jean Calvin, who themselves were simply riffing on St. Augustine.\n \n \n \n I encourage you to do so. Read them not with an eye to figuring out where they went wrong -- though you can come back to that later. Read them wondering -- \"Are these guys right?\"\n\n \n I have a half day today so I don't have enough time to continue right now.",

And of course, you've offered no argument against such a possibility at all, just a an ad hominem above and a counter-assertion in what follows.\n \n \nBoth of you read the Bible with your own hermeneutic of it being allegorical.\n\n \n And you are reading it with your own hermeneutic of it being literal.\n \n \nYou can reject a literal interpretation all you want, but it will not stop it from being literal.\n\n \n And you can use as many italics as you want, but this will not turn a mere statement into a well-argued justification.\n \n \nSo you have been told and so you desperately wish, but you are wrong.\n\n \n And one could say exactly the same about your literalism. With just as little point.\n \n Bluster and ad hominems won't get you anywhere.\n \n \nI am sorry but re-read the beginning Genesis 2. Have you ever read a novel before? It is not re-giving the account of creation; it is setting the scene for a story (a literal one (you cannot seem to identify those)). It also never says a time that he created the animals. It talks about man being in the garden then says in verse 19, \"Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the beasts of the field and all the birds of the air.\" It does not say \"then formed\". [emphases in your original]\n\n \n And \"I am sorry,\" too. \"Have you ever read\" something that was translated before? Have you ever considered that languages are ambiguous -- especially ancient languages? Have you ever considered how much interpretation is therefore built right into the act of translation itself?\n \n Wanna know what I think is truly \"dumb?\" Making such a big deal out of the English word \"had.\" The Hebrew is \"yatsar,\" which means \"formed\" or \"molded.\" This could also be interpreted as the pluperfect \"had formed,\" but there's certainly no knock-down drag-out case to be made on the basis of the language itself.\n \n Here's a sampling of some possible translations, along with consideration of the original Hebrew: http://scripturetext.com/genesis/2-19.htm .\n \n Here's my advice if you want to make linguistic points about the meaning of Genesis, whether literal or otherwise: learn Hebrew very well. To be fair, I'm no Hebrew scholar myself. But that's why I don't make linguistic points about Biblical interpretation.\n \n \"Had\" -- \"I am sorry,\" but this is just ridiculous.\n \n \nBoth are. There are 2 different words in the Greek language that mean \"word\". The word that is used here is \"LOGOS\" which is also used when referring to the scriptures. At the time it was written, the scriptures was only the Old Testament. Jesus was the fulfillment of the Old Testament.\n\n \n Logos is indeed the term used in John. Although I am no Greek scholar, I do haver more familiarity with Greek, through my philosophical training. And \"logos\" means many things: word, speech or what is spoken, reason, account, principle. The use of it in John is indicative of a great deal of philosophical learning on the part of the author, as well as a rather mystical bent insofar as \"logos\" is personified in Jesus.\n \n In any event, here are its occurrences in that Gospel:\n \n 1: 1, 14 \n 2: 22 \n 4: 37, 39, 41, 50 \n 5: 24, 38 \n 6: 60 \n 7: 36, 40 \n 8: 31, 37, 43, 51, 52, 55\n 10: 19, 35 \n 12: 38, 48 \n 14: 23, 24\n 15: 3, 20, 25 \n 17: 6, 14, 17, 20 \n 18: 9, 32 \n 19: 8, 13 \n 21: 23\n \n And not once -- not once -- is \"logos\" translated as \"scripture\" or \"scriptures,\" for the simple reason that it has no connotation of writing. In 2:22 and 10:35, \"scripture\" does appear in the translations -- in both instances as a translation of \"graphe,\" which means \"writing\" or \"what has been written.\" \"Logos\" is used in those passages to mean something quite other than the scriptures.\n \n As I have often said before, it is Biblical literalists such as yourself who do not take the scriptures seriously. They don't say what you claim they say.\n \n \nIt makes perfect sense when you think at all. Bible= believed to be absolute truth, but you add in: \"\"\"= words of men, so logically you must end with: words of men= absolute truth.\n\n \n I didn't add it in. I substituted it. \"Bible = words of men.\" And therefore, \"= fallible,\" like all things human.\n \n \nThey are without corruption. They say things that man would never say about man. They have not been changed in meaning since being written.\n\n \n Give me an example of anything in the Bible that a human being couldn't write. This will be a very tall order, as in fact, human beings did set pen to papyrus in order to write it.\n \n And the point about meaning is irrelevant. The words of Homer are what they are, and haven't changed; this doesn't make the Illiad a work of history.\n \n \nAgain you are narrowing your view. That verse says that there are false teachers so do not trust all people who claim to teach it.\n\n \n So what? The issue wasn't whom to trust in teaching about the Bible. The issue was whether the Bible demands that it be understood solely in terms of itself, i.e., exclusively internally. You claimed it makes this demand, and then you offered this passage in support. Now you're switching the subject entirely -- and with good reason, since the passage clearly doesn't make the demand that you were claiming it did.\n \n \nLook also at what Paul said about not even taking an apostle or priest at their word and you will be left with \"people are not the authority in teaching what the Bible says\". The only thing left to be the authority on it is the Bible itslef.\n\n \n Except its always the Bible as someone understands it. Even if you're right about Paul's meaning -- and I by no means concede this point -- \"apostles\" and \"priests\" are not exhaustive with respect to \"people.\" At a minimum, what it would mean is that each individual has to make up his own mind about the meaning of the text.\n \n The Bible doesn't interpret itself. It is by no means obvious how one should interpret things like Psalm 82 or Jesus cursing the fig tree. They require someone to think about them and understand them. Perhaps we should indeed be skeptical of religious authorities -- sounds like a great idea to me, in fact. It does not follow from this that our own human perspective can or even should be left behind.\n \n \nHahaha, in the verses you mentioned, the beginning of verse 2 says, \"Preach the Word...\" so it definitely does refer to the Bible itself.\n\n \n Except that things aren't so definite at all. Because the term used there is \"logos.\" And not \"graphe.\" Learn the difference, and heed it.\n \n \nOf course with your hermeneutic it would be saying \"Preach the Jesus\" which does not make sense\n\n \n If that doesn't make sense, then neither does the entire opening of John. It's mystical theology, for pity's sake.\n \n \nIt is an obvious consequence of being politically correct. The school did not want to offend any students or parents by talking about things like predestination election.\n\n \n Read Douglas Adams' So Long and Thanks for All the Fish. Then you will understand the reference to Wonko the Sane.\n \n \nBut I must ask first, how exactly did they disprove such things?\n\n \n By presenting evidence to show that claims of \"no evidence\" were false. By showing that there was not a scrap of evidence to support creationist claims (e.g. for the \"fountains of the deep\"). By showing that their arguments about what couldn't happen were invalid (e.g. \"irreducible complexity\"). By showing that claims about the improbability of it all (e.g. the \"tornado in a junkyard\") rested on erroneous assumptions of what evolution even says. And so forth.\n \n And since then, I've noticed, not a single creationist argument that has ever been made -- not one -- displays an actual understanding of the science involved, or the evidence upon which it is based.\n \n Of course, Biblical literalism doesn't even attempt to rigorously understand the Bible -- so why should it be a surprise that the creationism derived from it doesn't understand science, either?...",

Not only is it used in Johan to mean scripture, but also throughout all of the New Testament.\n \n I do not have time to look up references, but I have a computer program at home called \"Libronics\" that has every translation of the Bible ever made. When you put your mouse over a word, it tells you the Greek or Hebrew word that was origionally used. \"Logos\" is used many times to mean \"scripture\"\n \n \nAs I have often said before, it is Biblical literalists such as yourself who do not take the scriptures seriously. They don't say what you claim they say.\n\n \n Your ignorance of actual scripture is piling up. \n \n Here is an example of one that a methodist will not admit to be literal \"and Jesus said 'I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. Noone comes to the Father except through me.'\". How is that not literal? Did Jesus say \"except through me\" while meaning \"through me or one of the other thousands of ways\"? If you ever care to look, you will see how obvious the separation of literal and figurative is.\n \n \nI didn't add it in. I substituted it. \"Bible = words of men.\" And therefore, \"= fallible,\" like all things human.\n\n \n Yet by way of \"Bible= words of men\" you must believe \"Bible believers believe words of man\".\n \n \nGive me an example of anything in the Bible that a human being couldn't write. This will be a very tall order, as in fact, human beings did set pen to papyrus in order to write it.\n\n \n I did not say \"could not\" I said \"would not\". Men would never condemn themselves as evil (though they may condemn others) nor would they say that men are powerless to save themselves. If you look at every major religion, or even lesser ones, you will see that every single one is about doing enough \"good works\" to reach whatever heaven they believe in.\n \n Also look at leaders of religions that died (with voluntary followers unlike Muhammed (Mormonism keeps its followers by saying that leaving mormonism is the only way to go to hell (even Hitler is in mormon heaven because he never was a mormon to stop being one))), the followers disperse. Even the apostles went back to their old lives between Jesus' death and ressurection. Why would they stop following then randomly start preaching a Gospel that would get them all killed? (and no they did not suddenly go crazy and noone could have stolen the bones or any other poor excuse for why they would believe Jesus had risen whithout it happening.)\n \n \nAnd the point about meaning is irrelevant. The words of Homer are what they are, and haven't changed; this doesn't make the Illiad a work of history.\n\n \n It certainly is relevant. The Bible predicted it. It says, \"Not a jot or tiddle (small marks in Hebrew writing) shall be removed or added to this book until the endtimes\". The fact that 40 writers that wrote different books in different languages on different continents over a period of 1500+ years without ever contradicting eachother and having those books be put together and copied with extreme care means that it cannot be coincidence when we read the Bible.\n \n \nSo what? The issue wasn't whom to trust in teaching about the Bible. The issue was whether the Bible demands that it be understood solely in terms of itself, i.e., exclusively internally. You claimed it makes this demand, and then you offered this passage in support. Now you're switching the subject entirely -- and with good reason, since the passage clearly doesn't make the demand that you were claiming it did.\n\n \n Ok, so I see now that even such simple things slip your grasp so I will try to make it even easier. \n \n external interpretation= people interpreting it\n \n The Bible says people are unable to interpret the Bible so external interpretation= impossible\n \n No external interpretation= only internal interpretation.\n \n Back to your mistake in trying to interperet 2 Timothy 3:16. It absolutely claims to be God's own word. Look at the translation of \"God breathed\" and you will find that in no way does it equate to the \"God inspired\" that you want it to say.\n \n \nExcept its always the Bible as someone understands it. Even if you're right about Paul's meaning -- and I by no means concede this point -- \"apostles\" and \"priests\" are not exhaustive with respect to \"people.\" At a minimum, what it would mean is that each individual has to make up his own mind about the meaning of the text.\n\n \n That has to be one of the most illogical logical progressions I have ever heard. If Paul wanted to say \"you make up your own version of the scriptures\" then he would have. Paul told them to make sure that what he was saying was in accordance to the scriptures. If he thought they were left up to personal interpretation then why would he ever say this when there is no way everyone would interpret it in such a way that agreed with him.\n \n \nThe Bible doesn't interpret itself. It is by no means obvious how one should interpret things like Psalm 82 or Jesus cursing the fig tree. They require someone to think about them and understand them. Perhaps we should indeed be skeptical of religious authorities -- sounds like a great idea to me, in fact. It does not follow from this that our own human perspective can or even should be left behind.\n\n \n A Psalm is a poem (and usually a song). The only thing you could possibly see as figurative is when he says \"I said 'you are \"gods\"'\". Of course it is figurative! It has freaking quotations around it! David said it in reference to the Israelites being the \"children of God\".\n \n Why couldn't Jesus curse a fig tree? He is God. Why would someone who gives life not be able to take it away?\n \n Yes, it requires someone to think about them. It takes all the thought to learn to read.\n \n \"Human perspective\" should absolutely be left behind. Humans are fallible and evil.\n \n \nExcept that things aren't so definite at all. Because the term used there is \"logos.\" And not \"graphe.\" Learn the difference, and heed it.\n\n \n So now you admit that Logos is used for scriptures. Make up your mind please. \n \n Or perhaps you are actually so deluded that you do belive that it refers to Jesus here. If it did then it would mean to teach about Jesus' life. How do you learn about Jesus' life? Scripture.\n \n \n \nIf that doesn't make sense, then neither does the entire opening of John. It's mystical theology, for pity's sake.\n\n \n You need to retake a literature class apparently. There is a little thing called a \"metaphor\". Learn it.\n \n \nRead Douglas Adams' So Long and Thanks for All the Fish. Then you will understand the reference to Wonko the Sane.\n\n \n And I clarified that it was an unmerited insult.\n \n \nBy presenting evidence to show that claims of \"no evidence\" were false. By showing that there was not a scrap of evidence to support creationist claims (e.g. for the \"fountains of the deep\").\n\n \n How did they disprove underground water? and what do they intend to do about wells?\n \n \n\n By showing that their arguments about what couldn't happen were invalid (e.g. \"irreducible complexity\"). \n\n \n Try losing a lung. Or perhaps it is not a concept they understand.\n \n \nBy showing that claims about the improbability of it all (e.g. the \"tornado in a junkyard\") rested on erroneous assumptions of what evolution even says. And so forth.\n\n \n With what may I ask? The weak anthropic principal? A tornado in a junkyard creating a plane is far too likely to compare to life starting randomly with just some chemicals and lightning.\n \n \nAnd since then, I've noticed, not a single creationist argument that has ever been made -- not one -- displays an actual understanding of the science involved, or the evidence upon which it is based.\n\n \n I truly doubt you are familiar with them. As you said before, they are rejected before published. Rejected by whom? Evolutionists.\n \n \nOf course, Biblical literalism doesn't even attempt to rigorously understand the Bible -- so why should it be a surprise that the creationism derived from it doesn't understand science, either?...\n\n \n A literal interpretation is far more complicated than a \"oh, I don't like that so it must be figurative\" interpretation. Try to contemplate predestination election. Since you do not understand the Bible, you should not try to use it in comparisons or you may end up looking foolish.",

   "There is an absolutely distinct line between figurative and literal in the Bible that you refuse to see.\n\n \n -sigh- And as soon as you declare that your opponents \"refuse to see\" the truth, you are guilty of ad hominem argumentation. You're turning the issue into them, casting aspersions on their motives, rather than on demonstrating that this sharp line actually exists. Look at what comes next:\n \n \nwhen it says something like \"Jesus told a parable\" or most Psalms they are figurative; when it does not say that he was telling a parable, it is literal. It is not left to your interpretation to figure out which is which.\n\n \n This is a mere assertion: figurative here, literal there. It contains no justification for why the line should be drawn where you say.\n \n \nYou cannot, actually.\n\n \n Oh, but I can!\n \n \nLook again at what I said before. You deny it because you must. You do not want to hear what it has to say.\n\n \n Looking at what you said before, I see that this is just more ad hominem thinking, of exactly the same sort. You provide no reason to think that my view is erroneous. You simply go after my motives, after what I allegedly don't want.\n \n \nWow, denial much?\n\n \n And again, ad hominem. No explanation provided for why what I said was somehow wrong. Just going after me, for alleged \"denial.\" (And you don't even make it clear what I'm supposedly in \"denial\" about.)\n \n Going after your opponents' motives is a frequent tactic for you. Take away those ad hominems, and you lose a major portion of your case.\n \n But if you'd like to keep using them, I'm happy to reply in kind. Would you like to know what I think motivates you?... Just give me the go ahead to do unto you as you do unto me, and I'll happily comply.\n \n \nI wonder if you read them all.\n\n \n You mean all the verses of Genesis 2, and even 1? Yes, rest assured I did.\n \n \nDid you notice the part where 0 of them said anything like \"then created\" or \"and after that\" or \"last\" or anything that may give a slight suggestion of animals coming after humans on a timeline? No?\n\n \n No indeed. Did you notice that each of the chapters is related in a narrative order?\n \n Moreover...\n \n \nThen perhaps you should stop taking Bible skeptics at their word because they pull these arguements out of their butts (forgive my language).\n\n \n ...did you notice my comment about the Hebrew? My entire point was that the language is ambiguous. The Hebrew could be taken in either a past tense, or in a pluperfect tense. So merely pointing to what is written cannot settle the matter.\n \n To rest an interpretive choice upon the importance of a \"had\" appearing in an English translation, is therefore a terrible idea. Please note, this is what you had originally done -- go back and look at your original post, if you like -- so that's what I was responding to. Don't change the subject now and expect that my objection to your original point is somehow lessened in the process.\n \n Bible skeptics didn't make ancient Hebrew ambiguous.\n \n \nOk, so wrong again. Not only is it used in Johan to mean scripture...\n\n \n Bible skeptics also didn't make up John's use of logos.\n \n Your claim is simply false. There's no other way to say it. Go and look at each and every one of those verses. (I did, just to make sure I hadn't missed something.) They comprise every usage of \"logos\" in the Johanine Gospel. And they never use the word to refer to any of the sacred texts we now commonly refer to as \"the Scriptures.\"\n \n I'm not making this up. It's a fact, and it can be checked. Please do so.\n \n \n...but also throughout all of the New Testament.\n \n I do not have time to look up references, but I have a computer program at home called \"Libronics\" that has every translation of the Bible ever made. When you put your mouse over a word, it tells you the Greek or Hebrew word that was origionally used. \"Logos\" is used many times to mean \"scripture\"\n\n \n Okay. So show me where. Show me all the instances in the New Testament were \"logos\" appears. And show me that in \"many\" of those cases, it is used to refer to the sacred writings of the Judeo-Christian tradition. Provide your proof, instead of a bald assertion.\n \n \nYour ignorance of actual scripture is piling up. Here is an example of one that a methodist will not admit to be literal -- \n\n \n -sigh- Again you make it about your opponents, their ignorance, what they are willing to admit.\n \n Enough already with the ad hominems. But I interrupt:\n \n \nHere is an example of one that a methodist will not admit to be literal \"and Jesus said 'I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. Noone comes to the Father except through me.'\". How is that not literal? Did Jesus say \"except through me\" while meaning \"through me or one of the other thousands of ways\"?\n\n \n That's certainly not what's written! But the question that can be asked is, just what does it mean to \"come to the Father?\" and what does it mean to do so \"through\" Jesus?\n \n Does it mean that only those who worship Jesus will attain salvation? That's not literally what it says!...\n \n \nIf you ever care to look, you will see how obvious the separation of literal and figurative is.\n\n \n Again with the ad hominems!\n \n And again with the \"obvious\" criterion. Sorry, but when you say that something is \"obvious,\" I consider that mere dismissal, not rational justification.\n \n \nYet by way of \"Bible= words of men\" you must believe \"Bible believers believe words of man\".\n\n \n Yup! What's your point?\n \n \nI did not say \"could not\" I said \"would not\". Men would never condemn themselves as evil (though they may condemn others)...\n\n \n Why wouldn't they? Self-loathing is an all too real phenomenon.\n \n \n...nor would they say that men are powerless to save themselves. If you look at every major religion, or even lesser ones, you will see that every single one is about doing enough \"good works\" to reach whatever heaven they believe in.\n\n \n Why wouldn't they? If they sincerely believed that the approach employed by other religions was incorrect, why wouldn't they say so?\n \n \nAlso look at leaders of religions that died (with voluntary followers unlike Muhammed...\n\n \n He had plenty of voluntary followers, and still does.\n \n \n(Mormonism keeps its followers by saying that leaving mormonism is the only way to go to hell (even Hitler is in mormon heaven because he never was a mormon to stop being one))\n\n \n I would like direct evidence of this. Provide me with some sort of evidence that Mormons think only ex-Mormons receive damnation, and that Mormons think Hitler was saved. Preferably, I'd like to see evidence of a Mormon saying these things, not of an anti-Mormon saying them.\n \n Right now, I'm tremendously disinclined to think that you are an unbiased source of information about any religious view other than your own. So provide the proof.\n \n \nthe followers disperse. Even the apostles went back to their old lives between Jesus' death and ressurection. Why would they stop following then randomly start preaching a Gospel that would get them all killed?\n\n \n Why should we believe that this story is true? Why should we believe that just because the Bible recounts it, it happened that why?\n \n \n(and no they did not suddenly go crazy and noone could have stolen the bones or any other poor excuse for why they would believe Jesus had risen whithout it happening.)\n\n \n Why not? Make the counter-arguments instead of just dismissing them.\n \n \nIt certainly is relevant. The Bible predicted it. It says, \"Not a jot or tiddle (small marks in Hebrew writing) shall be removed or added to this book until the endtimes\". The fact that 40 writers that wrote different books in different languages on different continents over a period of 1500+ years without ever contradicting eachother and having those books be put together and copied with extreme care means that it cannot be coincidence when we read the Bible.\n\n \n Who said it's \"coincidence?\" I think it's a unified religious traidition. It hardly strikes me as \"coincidence\" that the members of such a tradition, who have access to the sacred texts of that tradition as they accumulate over time, would come up with largely consistent ideas.\n \n Especially after various rounds of editing, selection, and rejection. Look into the history of how the Bible came to be. It's fascinating.\n \n So this doesn't strike me as coincidence. It also doesn't strike me as a miracle.\n \n \nOk, so I see now that even such simple things slip your grasp so I will try to make it even easier.\n\n \n Always the ad hominems with you....\n \n \nexternal interpretation= people interpreting it\n \n The Bible says people are unable to interpret the Bible so external interpretation= impossible\n \n No external interpretation= only internal interpretation.\n\n \n If people are unable to interpret the Bible, then what you should conclude is impossible is understanding it.\n \n You don't get to put yourself into the position of the Bible itself. You're not the Bible, but a person.\n \n \nBack to your mistake in trying to interperet 2 Timothy 3:16. It absolutely claims to be God's own word. Look at the translation of \"God breathed\" and you will find that in no way does it equate to the \"God inspired\" that you want it to say.\n\n \n Mere assertion. Why doesn't \"God-breathed\" mean \"divinely inspired?\" And why can't something \"divinely inspired\" or otherwise \"God-breathed\" be fallible?\n \n \nThat has to be one of the most illogical logical progressions I have ever heard. If Paul wanted to say \"you make up your own version of the scriptures\" then he would have.\n\n \n And I didn't say that's what Paul said.\n \n \nPaul told them to make sure that what he was saying was in accordance to the scriptures.\n\n \n And each person is going to have to decide that for himself. When one opens up the scriptures, they don't just say, \"And what Paul says is in accordance with this.\" We have to figure it out for ourselves.\n \n \nIf he thought they were left up to personal interpretation then why would he ever say this when there is no way everyone would interpret it in such a way that agreed with him.\n\n \n Because he's hoping that they will agree! Just because various interpretations are possible doesn't mean none are better than others. Clearly, Paul thought comparison with the scriptures would prove him right. My point -- not Paul's, but mine -- was that demanding for people to check the scriptures while being skeptical of authority, means that interpretations will ultimately be left to the individual.\n \n This is why protestantism has splintered into so many sects, after all!\n \n \nA Psalm is a poem (and usually a song). The only thing you could possibly see as figurative is when he says \"I said 'you are \"gods\"'\". Of course it is figurative! It has freaking quotations around it!\n\n \n Not in the Hebrew! Ancient Hebrew had no such punctuation marks.\n \n You should really stop basing your interpretations on the minutiae of English translations.\n \n \nDavid said it in reference to the Israelites being the \"children of God\".\n\n \n But so far as I recall, he never referred to the Israelites as \"gods.\" Yes?\n \n \nWhy couldn't Jesus curse a fig tree? He is God. Why would someone who gives life not be able to take it away?\n\n \n Who said he couldn't? But why would he? Why would Jesus curse a tree for not bearing fruit out of season (as Mark's version explicitly notes)?\n \n What does this story mean? I haven't a clue.\n \n \nYes, it requires someone to think about them. It takes all the thought to learn to read.\n\n \n Reading and understanding are two different things. I can read the story of the fig tree, no problem. I just don't understand it.\n \n \n\"Human perspective\" should absolutely be left behind.\n\n \n Can't be done. If one is human, one by definition has a human perspective. And that carries fallibility with it.\n \n One may never -- never -- presume to speak from a divinely infallible perspective. All Christians should know this.\n \n \nHumans are fallible and evil.\n\n \n See, humans can condemn themselves as evil after all!...\n \n In any event, I disagree, in part. All humans are fallible. Only some are evil, though.\n \n \nSo now you admit that Logos is used for scriptures. Make up your mind please.\n\n \n No, if it had meant \"scriptures,\" it would have said \"graphe.\"\n \n \nOr perhaps you are actually so deluded that you do belive that it refers to Jesus here.\n\n \n Of course it does! Jesus' example, what he said, his teaching, his principle -- all of these are perfectly reasonable uses for \"logos,\" which has a lot of meanings.\n \n But none of those meanings is \"writing\" or \"written words\" or \"things written.\"\n \n \nIf it did then it would mean to teach about Jesus' life. How do you learn about Jesus' life? Scripture.\n\n \n Not in Paul's day, you didn't.\n \n The Gospel of Mark was the earliest of the Gospels, and it was written at approximately 65-70 AD -- after Paul's death. The Gospels of Matthew and Luke were written later, around the 80's, probably with Matthew first; both authors were clearly familiar with Mark, while the author of Luke may even have been familiar with Matthew. The Gospel of John was written right around AD 100, as anti-Christian persecution was high; Christianity began to split from Judaism at this time, becoming no longer a reform movement within Judaism but a separate religion of its own.\n \n Of course, at the time of the writing of 2 Timothy, it is quite possible that at least Mark's Gospel had come into existence. Because there's a lot of evidence that 2 Timothy was not written by Paul. (Nor were 1 Timothy or Titus, and it's possible that a couple others weren't, either. Please note that I'm not claiming the authors were being dishonest: using another figures name as an author was a common and honorable practice in the ancient world, in fact even a way of showing reverence for a teacher or important figure.) So you might be right! Albeit not in a way that's helpful for your case.\n \n Please study the actual history of the Bible and of early Christianity. Not just what the Bible says, but what other sources about how the text and the religion developed. I truly believe it when I say it's fascinating stuff.\n \n And although I'm not a Christian myself, I know many Christians (e.g. my father) who aren't bothered by the history at all, because they separate the literary expressions from the spiritual truths expressed.\n \n \nYou need to retake a literature class apparently. There is a little thing called a \"metaphor\". Learn it.\n\n \n Jesus is not just \"the Word\" in a metaphorical sense, according to John. He's the Word of God personified, even God himself. The opening of John refers all the way back to Genesis, and helps introduce Trinitarian doctrine into the main development of Christianity.\n \n With all due respect, I'm not the one who needs some classes, and the classes needed are not literature but theology and religious history.\n \n \nAnd I clarified that it was an unmerited insult.\n\n \n Oh, it was quite merited! Or I thought so at the time. I apologize.\n \n \nHow did they disprove underground water? and what do they intend to do about wells?\n\n \n Morris' \"fountains of the deep\" claim concerns vasts underground caverns that poured forth enough H2O to cover the planet. It's entirely different from mere groundwater, and there isn't a scrap of evidence for it. He made it up to fit a preconception.\n \n \nTry losing a lung. Or perhaps it is not a concept they understand.\n\n \n I had a great uncle who lost one to TB. What's your point?\n \n \nWith what may I ask? The weak anthropic principal? A tornado in a junkyard creating a plane is far too likely to compare to life starting randomly with just some chemicals and lightning.\n\n \n The tornado in a junkyard completely ignores that evolution doesn't claim complexity arises in a single step. Natural selection produces results that are cumulative, and the tornado-in-a-junkyard fails to address this.\n \n \nI truly doubt you are familiar with them. As you said before, they are rejected before published. Rejected by whom? Evolutionists.\n\n \n Creationists are rejected by scientific journals. But they still publish plenty on their own. It's really not hard to familiarize oneself with the claims and arguments.\n \n \nA literal interpretation is far more complicated than a \"oh, I don't like that so it must be figurative\" interpretation.\n\n \n But above you said, all that literal interpretation requires is the ability to read? That's not so complicated.\n \n \nTry to contemplate predestination election.\n\n \n I have. I find it wanting.\n \n I certainly don't find any literal discussion of \"predestination election\" in the Bible itself. Just some people interpreting it in what's said there.\n \n \nSince you do not understand the Bible, you should not try to use it in comparisons or you may end up looking foolish.\n\n \n Yes, well, never has anybody looked more foolish than when you so vehemently made a point about Psalm 82 based on... quotation marks.\n \n Frankly, I think that shows exactly how well you understand the Bible. Exactly how well.",

   " That's just not true. The christian belief in the creation of the universe from nothing by a mythical, supernatural being may predate Darwin, but \"creationism\" was actually a rejection of Darwinism that arose in the 1920s. Creationists were responsible for the laws that forbade the teaching of evolution in science classes. That eventually became \"creation science\" and then ID creationism. But courts have consistently determined that science should be taught in science classes.\n\n \n Ah, but look at the evidence presented in the greatest and earliest trial that challenged creationism, the skopes monkey trial. Wasn't the newly discovered Piltdown Man and Nebraska Man presented as evidence of the truth of evolution to great effect and impact in the Press at the time the trial was going on? Only to be discovered to be a massive hoax decades later? I submit to you that if false, fraudulent and erroneous evidence wasn't presented in the news during and subsequent to that trial which allowed the false science of evolution to get a foothold and a sense of legitimacy in the 1920s, it wouldn't have grown to be widely accepted by people like you today who have been brainwashed to believe the lies and misinterpretation of observations evolution represents at every turn.\n Nebraska Man\n \n Nothing in the history of evolution seems to have aroused such widespread misconceptions as the case of Nebraska Man, as illustrated by two quotations:\n \n In 1922 Senator W.J. Bryan was campaigning against children being taught that they were descended from apes, and eventually went to court to fight the famous 'Scope's trial. While the case was in progress, a tooth was found in Nebraska which Prof. Osborn of the American Natural History Museum claimed had characteristics that were a mixture of human, chimpanzee and Pithecanthropus. ...\n What is of particular interest however is the timing of this 'discovery' of the tooth which took place whilst the court case was still going on. I have no proof in support of my views but I cannot help suspecting that it was deliberately timed and given a great deal of publicity at that precise moment in an effort to sway the final outcome of the case. As it was, Bryan won, but was awarded a derisorily small sum as damages.\"\n \n Also:\n \n \"There are in truth no missing links in the record which connects man with the other members of the order of primates.\"\n In reality this was a grossly short-sighted point of view - but very common, in 1925. As archaeologist Dr. Cornwall, of the University of London, explained, many years later:\n \n \"When, in the early years of this century, Pithicanthropus from Java, the Heidelberg jaw and the Neanderthal man were the only known fossils, it was easy to see in them a line of human evolution leading directly to modern man. More recent discoveries of human ancestors, combined with our better methods of geological dating, have shown this simple explanation to be quite impossible ...\"\n (Italics as in the original text)\n Before moving on to other aspects of the expert testimony I'd like to take a moment to introduce two characters who clearly illustrate the view of the \"evolution of man\" as it existed at the time of the Scopes trial.\n One of these \"gentlemen\" - Piltdown Man - appeared in two of the expert affidavits. The other - Nebraska Man - after three years of worldwide publicity, was already (though few people knew it at the time) making his way onto the scrap heap of history.http://www.google.com/url?url=http://www.bradburyac.mistral.co.uk/tenness5.html&rct=j&sa=U&ei=68XWTPf2MYKglAeTuKCECQ&ved=0CCMQFjAC&sig2=DARELHJuOSUkpiCoXczBxg&q=nebraska+man+hoax&usg=AFQjCNENbRnDo3ZNwCN8L-NnZowYkimljw",

As archaeologist Dr. Cornwall, of the University of London, explained, many years later:\n \n \"When, in the early years of this century, Pithicanthropus from Java, the Heidelberg jaw and the Neanderthal man were the only known fossils, it was easy to see in them a line of human evolution leading directly to modern man. More recent discoveries of human ancestors, combined with our better methods of geological dating, have shown this simple explanation to be quite impossible ...\"\n (Italics as in the original text)\n Before moving on to other aspects of the expert testimony I'd like to take a moment to introduce two characters who clearly illustrate the view of the \"evolution of man\" as it existed at the time of the Scopes trial.\n One of these \"gentlemen\" - Piltdown Man - appeared in two of the expert affidavits. The other - Nebraska Man - after three years of worldwide publicity, was already (though few people knew it at the time) making his way onto the scrap heap of history.http://www.google.com/url?url=http://www.bradburyac.mistral.co.uk/tenness5.html&rct=j&sa=U&ei=68XWTPf2MYKglAeTuKCECQ&ved=0CCMQFjAC&sig2=DARELHJuOSUkpiCoXczBxg&q=nebraska+man+hoax&usg=AFQjCNENbRnDo3ZNwCN8L-NnZowYkimljw\n\n \n Ah yes.. the Nebraska man fraud..

But this pseudo scientific community is so dishonest it has no reputable oversight. Instead of always asking me for evidence which I, AM producing, why don't any of you prove the legitimacy of this alleged science?\n A notable case of a scientists using fraudulent material to promote the theory of evolution was the work of German scientist and atheist Ernst Haeckel. Noted evolutionist Stephen Gould wrote the following regarding Ernst Haeckel's work in a March 2000 issue of Natural History:\n \n \"Haeckel's forceful, eminently comprehensible, if not always accurate, books appeared in all major languages and surely exerted more influence than the works of any other scientist, including Darwin...in convincing people throughout the world about the validity of evolution... Haeckel had exaggerated the similarities [between embryos of different species] by idealizations and omissions. He also, in some cases - in a procedure that can only be called fraudulent - simply copied the same figure over and over again....Haeckel's drawings never fooled expert embryologists, who recognized his fudgings right from the start. Haeckel's drawings, despite their noted inaccuracies, entered into the most impenetrable and permanent of all quasi-scientific literatures: standard student textbooks of biology... Once ensconced in textbooks, misinformation becomes cocooned and effectively permanent, because...textbooks copy from previous texts.... We do, I think, have the right to be both astonished and ashamed by the century of mindless recycling that has led to the persistence of these drawings in a large number, if not a majority, of modern textbooks!\"\n \n Stephen Gould continues by quoting Michael Richardson of the St. George's Hospital Medical School in London, who stated: \"I know of at least fifty recent biology texts which use the drawings uncritically\".\n \n Professor Reiner Protsch von Zieten was a professor of anthropology at Frankfurt University for 30 years before he was forced to resign.[11] It was found that he falsified dates on many \"stone age\" fossils which included a skull fragment named Hahnh\u00f6fersand Man which supposedly linked humans and Neanderthals.[12] The scientific fraud only came to light when he was caught attempting to sell his department's complete chimpanzee skull collection to the United States.[13] An investigation later established that he had also passed off fake fossils as genuine ones.[14]\n \n The most famous case of a hoax perpetrated on scientists in regards to the evolutionary view was the case of Piltdown man.[15] More recently, although it might not have been the result of a deliberate hoax, the Archaeoraptor was a large embarrassment to National Geographic.[16][17]\n \n The Nebraska man (also called Hesperopithecus haroldcookii) was a case of speculation. Nebraska man was promoted based on the find of a single peccary-like tooth (wild pig-like tooth). Dr. Henry Fairfield Osborn, head of the Department of Palaeontology at New York's American Museum of Natural History, wrote the following in the press concerning Williams Jennings Bryan:\n \n Dr. Tim White, anthropologist at the University of California-Berkeley, gave the name \"Flipperpithecus\" to a supposed \"humanoid species\" arising from a fossil find that is most likely part of a dolphin's rib.\n \" \"The earth spoke to Bryan from his own state of Nebraska. The Hesperopithecus tooth is like the still, small voice. Its sound is by no means easy to hear... This little tooth speaks volumes of truth, in that it affords evidence of man's descent from the ape.\"[18][19] \"\n Nebraska Man was debated vigorously among evolutionary paleoanthropologists for five years until Dr. Gregory King Williams published a refutation of the find in the journal Science which ended the debate[20] Nebraska man never gained wide acceptance by evolutionary scientists although it enjoyed coverage in the Illustrated London News.[21][22]\n \n \"A five million-year-old piece of bone that was thought to be a collarbone of a humanlike creature is actually part of a dolphin rib...The problem with a lot of anthropologists is that they want so much to find a hominid that any scrap of bone becomes a hominid bone.\" - Dr. Tim White (anthropologist, University of California, Berkeley). As quoted by Ian Anderson \"Hominoid collarbone exposed as dolphin's rib\", in New Scientist, 28 April 1983, p. 199http://www.google.com/url?url=http://www.conservapedia.com/Theory_of_Evolution_and_Cases_of_Fraud,_Hoaxes_and_Speculation&rct=j&sa=U&ei=_RbXTJ2UA8WBlAeb8LT9CA&ved=0CDEQFjAD&sig2=YJZ_RJuWdgjKcgjGIVTdRA&q=piltdown+man+and+nebraska+man+frauds&usg=AFQjCNGYxK-1u4IRsFzXWdUuJOxnxDwUfA\n \n It is the fact that these errors, assumptions, false conclusions and outright frauds are allowed to be repeated in text books and journals for decades that continues to proliferate the validity of this false and pseudo science. And it isn't lost on me for one-second that you lemmings of this lie never post any actual proof to defend evolution, or to attempt to sway me with any reasonable and convincing evidence. All you guys have is Talk Origins which was created specifically to deal with the creationist opposition but doesn't come close to actually proving evolution is real or true science in any way.",

   "Here's more on Haeckel's embryos in modern text books as further evidence of the on going fraud of evolution science.\n \n WHAT DO MODERN TEXTBOOKS REALLY SAY ABOUT HAECKEL'S EMBRYOS? \n \n By: Casey Luskin\n Discovery Institute\n March 27, 2007\n \n Many Darwinists are scurrying around on their blogs and at movie screenings, trying to rewrite history by claiming that Haeckel&#8217;s embryo drawings were never used in modern textbooks. In a contradictory claim, some then concede that modern textbooks have used the drawings but argue that Haeckel&#8217;s work was only cited to provide some historical context to evolutionary theory&#8212;they assert that Haeckel&#8217;s fraudulent drawings have not been used to promote evolution in modern textbooks. They are wrong on both counts. \n \n To avoid confusion, let me point out that we are not claiming that Haeckel's embryo drawings and recapitulation theory are the bedrock of evolutionary biology in 2007. Nor are we arguing that every textbook that has used Haeckel&#8217;s fraudulent drawings (or some near-identical colorized version) therefore promoted the idea that &#8220;ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.&#8221; As Jonathan Wells points out in his recent article, The Cracked Haeckel Approach to Evolutionary Reasoning, &#8220;Many modern biology textbooks inform students that Haeckel&#8217;s dictum, &#8216;ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny,&#8217; has been discredited, but the same textbooks often use Haeckel&#8217;s drawings (or modern versions of them) to persuade students that human embryos provide clues to our evolutionary history and evidence for Darwin&#8217;s theory.&#8221; Therefore, what we are claiming is that various modern textbooks have used Haeckel&#8217;s embryo drawings in precisely the manner that Darwinists now deny:\n \n (1) They show embryo drawings that are essentially recapitulations of Haeckel's fraudulent drawings &#8212; drawings that downplay and misrepresent the actual differences between early stages of vertebrate embryos;\n \n (2) They have used these drawings as evidence for evolution &#8212; in the present day &#8212; and not simply to provide some kind of historical context for evolutionary thought;\n \n (3) Even if the textbooks do not completely endorse Haeckel&#8217;s false &#8220;recapitulation&#8221; theory, they have used their Haeckel-based drawings to overstate the actual similarities between early embryos, which is the key misrepresentation made by Haeckel. They then cite these overstated similarities as still-valid evidence for common ancestry. \n \n Some Darwinists continue to deny that there has been any misuse of Haeckel in recent times. If that is the case, why did Stephen Jay Gould attack how textbooks use Haeckel in 2000? Gould wrote: &#8220;We should... not be surprised that Haeckel's drawings entered nineteenth-century textbooks. But we do, I think, have the right to be both astonished and ashamed by the century of mindless recycling that has led to the persistence of these drawings in a large number, if not a majority, of modern textbooks!&#8221; (emphasis added) Similarly, in 1997, the leading embryologist Michael K.

   "What I find interesting is that someone like Gould openly talks about frauds like Haeckel's embryos, and qualifies it as such, when creationists merely talk about their truth and evolutionist frauds without doing the same on their side. Agreeing on the fact that there were frauds is one of the way to get things right, corrected, just what science is meant to do. I personnally never denied there were frauds, whoever made them. \n \n I've made a (biased) 5 minutes google search and for instance I can refer to this link for creationist frauds:\n \n Creationist Arguments: Anomalous Fossils\n \n Knowing this alone doesn't make me stop listening to creationists. At least, those who are honest enough to concede that there have been frauds on each \"side\". No matter how many, how stupid, etc. \n \n I've also noticed that EasyRider, which seems to be a fervent believer has quoted a muslim creationist who has been spreading his lies in his books; Adnan Oktar (better known under the name Arun Yahya).\n \n Things like:\n \n \n\n Otkar claims that the theory of evolution is a Masonic conspiracy initiated by the Rosicrucians.\n\n \n Adnan Oktar - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n Harun Yahya - An Invitation to The Truth\n \n A christian creationist quoting a muslim creationist, who \"invites us to the truth\"... Do any scientist think he/she holds \"the truth\"? \n \n What amazes me is that a large part of the people (namely creationists) in this forum, as in others, only participate to get an opportunity to say \"you're busted\", \"prove it\", etc. \n \n I know some people from the \"other side\" are also like this and it makes me sad, because it shows there is no will to really share thoughts, but only to state things as truth or lecturing people who won't read posts that are adressed to them. Moreover, quote mining makes the whole thing very difficult.",

The whole process is fixed and can only be summarized as a massive scam if one wants to be honest.\n\n \n Larni beat me to it.\n \n \nYou must have a terribly short memory if you can't remember cold fusion, MMR jabs causing autism, rain follows plough, maternal impression/unconscious transmission and human cloning (to name but a few).\n\n \n evolution is not alone when it comes to slip-ups.\n \n hold on a minute...\n \n \n ...his drawings were wrong! his thesis was correct. \n\n \n \nNo, you said this, I quote: Haeckel gets a bad rep from creationists, but his observations and original thesis are correct. he just sucked at drawing. \n\n \n i see no contradiction... but just to make sure, lets have a second look:\n \n \n ...his drawings were wrong! his thesis was correct. \n\n \n \nNo, you said this, I quote: Haeckel gets a bad rep from creationists, but his observations and original thesis are correct. he just sucked at drawing. \n\n \n nope, no contradiction. you posted a video which stated exactly what i had said. the fact is (and this is observable with a microscope), fetuses of humans and fish and various other vertibrates look very similar at certain stages of development. thus, Haeckel was correct. his drawings were incorrect. if his drawings are still in textbook publication (most likely not in mainstream textbooks), they, or a more accurate interpretation, belong there, because Haeckel is acknowledged to be correct.",

   "Is evolution only about Haeckel and his drawings?\n \n And there's no substance to support the theory? And why are we forced to read and hear that \"belief system\" thing? Science has nothing to do with belief. Creationist always try to make the issue a belief issue. Science is based on research, and if there ever is an obvious bias, then science has to correct it. I don't like beer, it doesn't mean I'm a water propagandist. t And there are catholic, muslim scientists, who believe in a god and at the same time do their research work.\n \n By the way since EZ used an astronomer quote as a signature, I thought of this one:\n \n \"The suppression of uncomfortable ideas may be common in religion or in politics, but it is not the path to knowledge, and there's no place for it in the endeavor of science. We do not know beforehand where fundamental insights will arise from about our mysterious and lovely solar system. The history of our study of our solar system shows us clearly that accepted and conventional ideas are often wrong, and that fundamental insights can arise from the most unexpected sources.\" - Carl SAGAN.\n \n \n On one hand you could say that thinking the evolution theory is valid is a conventional thing to do, because it's the main stuff that's taught in schools, etc. But it's not conventional (conformist), since it's based on research, AND correction of mistakes (and frauds!). It is not still. \n \n To me religion and religious views are conventional, though I've always respected them.\n \n Once on another forum one guy was so proud and happy to share his admiration of Mendel's work (thinking he could lecture me about it) that he forgot to understand this very work was used in support of the theory of evolution, when he kept telling me that it was some sort of \"smoking gun\" to shoot it down.

Although I patiently await your response, I wont hold my breathe. emoticon_xbye \n\n \n alright, alright. calm down, i already said i would. first things first, that is NOT the definition of evolution. i absolutely hate when creationists combine evolution with abiogenesis. the two have nothing to do with each other. since you, like all creationists havent the slightest clue how evolution --- or the scientific method, for that matter, work, ill catch you up. the definition of evolution is, and im quoting unkerpaulie here, \"the change in frequency of a gene allele over time within a population.\" over a large amount of time, speciation can occur from this; hense macroevolution. abiogenesis is what you describe as stuff conglomerating into a single cell 3.5 billion years ago.\n \n now that thats understood, the evidence for genetic changes over time within a population is extremely vast. keep an open mind about this evidence, i know that youve already got it into your head that this evidence is wrong like all creationists do, but at least try.\n \n the first thing im going to show you is very easy to imagine. even fartingle got it, i think. a virus like HIV does not speciate, but rather a new strain of it can be formed within the population in the environment (a person's body). since HIV is asexual, there are no species. a strain in asexual organisms can be thought of as the same thing. when a person takes medication to treat HIV, they find that it doesnt help. it usually gets worse. thats not because the medicine doesnt work, it does, its just that the virus population develops an immunity to the drugs. at first, HIV has a lot of variation in the population. some have resistance to certain drugs. when a person takes drugs that kill certain individuals, they cannot reproduce any longer; that variation has gone extinct in the environment. after many different drugs are taken, sometimes only one variant is left - the one that's immune to all of the drugs. since HIV has a lot of variations, its common to have one that is immune to all of the known drugs. this one will reproduce and soon the entire population will become a new strain from the original. in this example, the body is the environment, the drugs are acting as the natural selection agent, and the infected person is acting as the predator. the result is successful evolution of the virus.\n \n second example: dogs. dogs are an extreme case of evolution in action. theyve come about by something called artificial selection - humans become the selecting agent, not natural forces. people took a bunch of wild wolves and chose the two least vicious ones and bred them. the result was a wolf that was less vicious than all of the others. this continued until we had a very calm, domesticated wolf. then we started choosing wolves to breed based on other factors - speed for example and a greyhound came from that. thats why greyhound breeders choose to breed based on racing success rather than physical attributes. now, all these dogs can still reproduce biologically, but when you take the population of dogs and allow them to reproduce randomly, as is required for natural selection, what you will end up with is not the original wolf, but a very lazy, easily tired, calm, friendly... thing. thus, humans have successfully modified the genetic properties of a wolf population.\n \n this is all fine and dandy, but why dont i show you an example of speciation? although speciation is not required to be considered macroevolution, it is impressive, and you probably want to see it. heres a previous thread that i made a while ago with a video describing something called a ring species:\n Salamanders in California\n as pandion says, a species of warbles (a gross parasitic fly) branches off in the Tibetan plateau as a ring species, and where the two variants meet in Southern Siberia, they are so different, their genetics are so dissimilar that they are incompatible and they cannot reproduce. this is a rare case of observable speciation. he describes a species of North American gulls that do the same:\n \n \nPreviously, several species of northern gulls (of the genus Larus) that encircle the arctic were thought to be a ring species, formed from several phenotypically and morphologically different species that are still able to hybridize where they overlap. However, recent genetic research has shown that the case is more complicated than that. It seems that the various species are all descended from two refuge populations from a single population that were driven south during the last ice age. At the end of the ice age, as the gull populations moved north, they formed what is now a single, contiguous, interbreeding population in which the extremes can no longer interbreed (i.e., herring gulls and lesser black backed gulls that occupy the same range in northern Europe). Additionally, gull populations to the south, that are undoubtedly descendants of the previously ice age isolated populations. I refer you to the range of the American herring gull as depicted in The Sibley Guide to Birds. Herring gulls are found in non-mountainous regions across the US in the summer, and across the north of Canada and the northern part of the eastern US in the winter. I have seen them in Montana (spring and fall), Massachusetts and Maine (year round), and on the gulf coast of Texas (summer).\n \n Thus, a population that now appears to be a single contiguous population is actually the result of two refuge populations that rejoined at the end of the last ice age. They still form a single interbreeding population in which the extremes no longer interbreed.\n\n \n brilliant.\n \n how about the human evolution branch?

   "Look, your defense of Haeckel is obvious and also pathetic since there is no way to legitimately repair what he did to make his drawings appear to be honest renditions of reality.\n\n \n So if I say, \"Haeckel's drawings are indefensible,\" what does that mean to you?\n \n Heck, your own video noted that evolutionists like Gould have, in fact, been criticial of using them in textbooks. That would seem to undermine at least part of your case, eh?\n \n \nYou people will go to any lengths to justify the errors and misrepresentations within evolution.\n\n \n And I think \"you people\" will go to any lengths to impose theocracy. The Discovery Institute's notorious \"Wedge Document\" reveals just how much stealth that nest of vipers is willing to employ in the service of that goal.\n \n \nYou are in effect telling me that even though his drawings were inaccurate, he was right in his end result.\n\n \n That's right. And your own photographs prove it. Seeing that guy hold up those photos as if they somehow disprove evolution is laughable.\n \n What they show is two things. First, Haeckel got it wrong, clearly. Second, there really are similarities among the embryos. They all have notochords, pharyngeal pouches, and somites, for example. There are certainly differences. But the similarities are undeniable.\n \n Why do you think that lecturer didn't point out the similarities? What do you think that says about his honesty?\n \n \nYour excuse that each embryo retains the sum parts of vertebrate embryos is vacuous and irrelevant to the reality that the drawings in text books for generation now are completely inaccurate and misleading to the children who were shown them as examples of evolutionary similarities at the embryonic stage.\n\n \n The similarities are there. And to repeat, your own photographs display them even more accurately than Haeckel's drawings.\n \n \nAnd for you to defend this deception with these ridiculous excuses make you equally culpable for the deception.\n\n \n What deception? The similarities are right there to see. What's deceptive is not to acknowledge them, like that lecturer chose not to. Quite the persuasive liar, that fellow.\n \n \nAnd here are my photos of actual vertebrate embryos at the same stage of development respectively, which have nothing at all in common at all, visually speaking.\n\n \n They have quite a lot in common, visually speaking. Your own photos are proving the very point you're arguing against. Look for the notochord, the somites, etc. You'll find 'em.\n \n \nAnd why haven't any of you posted evidence that the embryonic examples relied on in Haeckel's drawings or the so called corrected drawings which currently exist, are at the same stage of development as mine do? \n\n \n We don't need to: your own photographs prove the evolutionary point.\n \n It's precisely because common features like the notochord and somites can be found that these embryos are said to have reached \"the same stage of development.\" The \"phylotypic stage\" is defined by possessing such common features!\n \n \nLet me answer that question for you, it's because you know that the info in this video which clarifies that embryos at different stages of development were purposely chosen, and used as examples for their physical resemblance rather than any true similarities they have with each other.\n\n \n Okay, for starters, isn't \"physical resemblance\" a point of \"true similarity?\" You seem to be so sputteringly mad here that you're not even coherent anymore.\n \n Beyond that, do you think that the embryos in your own photographs do not display features like notochords and pharyngeal slits and somites?...\n \n \nThe dishonesty you people represent considering these frauds have been perpetrated against our children from middle school on for a hundred years now is not only pathetic but reprehensible.\n\n \n What's dishonest to the point of reprehensibility is for that lecturer not to point out the similarities between the embryos...\n \n \nHere's how Casey Luskin of the Discovery Institute explains it... He even says at the end of the video that he isn't defending or promoting the teaching of creationism in schools, only GOOD SCIENCE which he give 2 examples of bad science in this video.\n\n \n ...and for Luskin to present himself and the DI as neutral, despite the Wedge Document, and for that interviewer to present himself as an objective journalist, when all he did was throw softballs with no critical import and no follow-up challenges to Luskin. Dishonesty, dishonesty, dishonesty.\n \n In any event, dishonesty aside, let me reiterate my main point, and emphasize it:\n \n YOUR OWN PHOTOGRAPHS PROVE EXACTLY THE POINT YOU ARE TRYING TO REFUTE. THEY CLEARLY SHOW SIMILARITIES SUCH AS NOTOCHORDS, PHARYNGEAL POUCHES, AND SOMITES.\n \n In fact, I would really hope that a biologist on this board might submit those very photographs to a publisher with the recommendation that they replace any Haeckel-derived drawings of vertebrate development. In part, this is because they are of course more accurate than Haeckel's drawings, which should be eliminated from curriculum. But it's also because using something creationists thought would be a challenge to Darwinism to help support it... well, that's just hilarious.",

   "alright, alright. calm down, i already said i would. first things first, that is NOT the definition of evolution. \n\n \n But it is the claim of evolutionists to a T until they are forced to defend their philosophy of how Man came to be here. But you love to categorize it so you don't have to prove the overall assertions which you claim occurred from the beginning until now.\n \n \n i absolutely hate when creationists combine evolution with abiogenesis. the two have nothing to do with each other. since you, like all creationists havent the slightest clue how evolution --- or the scientific method, for that matter, work, ill catch you up.\n\n \n Here comes the condescension and sanctimony as you again assume you have the upper hand in the area of understanding what's up with your chosen philosophy for how life came to be.\n \n \n the definition of evolution is, and im quoting unkerpaulie here, \"the change in frequency of a gene allele over time within a population.\" over a large amount of time, speciation can occur from this; hense macroevolution. abiogenesis is what you describe as stuff conglomerating into a single cell 3.5 billion years ago.\n\n \n Gee, I suppose if unkerpaulie says it then it must be true, huh? What an absolute lemming you are to accept any of the horse dung you have posted here as either proven absolutely or accurate in reality in any way. You are brainwashed and damaged if you actually believe the tripe you are promoting here.\n \n \nnow that thats understood, the evidence for genetic changes over time within a population is extremely vast. keep an open mind about this evidence, i know that youve already got it into your head that this evidence is wrong like all creationists do, but at least try.\n\n \n My mind is open but I expect actual evidence, not just unsubstantiated claims which you guys constantly spew, but have no way of actually confirming in reality.\n \n \nthe first thing im going to show you is very easy to imagine. even fartingle got it, i think. a virus like HIV does not speciate, but rather a new strain of it can be formed within the population in the environment (a person's body). since HIV is asexual, there are no species. a strain in asexual organisms can be thought of as the same thing. when a person takes medication to treat HIV, they find that it doesnt help. it usually gets worse. thats not because the medicine doesnt work, it does, its just that the virus population develops an immunity to the drugs. at first, HIV has a lot of variation in the population. some have resistance to certain drugs. when a person takes drugs that kill certain individuals, they cannot reproduce any longer; that variation has gone extinct in the environment. after many different drugs are taken, sometimes only one variant is left - the one that's immune to all of the drugs. since HIV has a lot of variations, its common to have one that is immune to all of the known drugs. this one will reproduce and soon the entire population will become a new strain from the original. in this example, the body is the environment, the drugs are acting as the natural selection agent, and the infected person is acting as the predator. the result is successful evolution of the virus.\n\n \n Different strains of HIV don't just randomly mutate without the interaction of infected people who mix bodily fluids with uninfected people and spread the virus that way.

The first thing you must prove to me is that the claim that these salamanders migrated to different parts of California millions of years ago in order to evolve as he claims they did, actually occurred. Where's his evidence of that assumption?\n \n \nhow about the human evolution branch? Becoming Human - New Scientist click on each of the links to see the new scientist article.\n\n \n Great, when one has been completely castrated in the evidence arena then post a graph of all of his erroneous claims.

Also, your link refers to Coelacanth as another example of a transitional fish, yet they have been found to still exist precisely as their fossils appeared some 300 million years ago.

HIV and other viruses (like influenza) are the ticket.\n \n artificial selection is an illustration of how genetics can be modified. in the case of dogs, humans act as the selecting agent. in the case of flowers, bees and birds act as the selecting agents. we choose properties we like for dogs in the same way bees choose the properties they like for flowers - like smell or honey quality, and the population genetics change as a result. ps: how come we only talk about animals when discussing evolution? plants are totally awesome.\n \n ill also correct your \"dog into a horse\" rubbish. dogs and horses are both modern animals. they are not decended from one another; they are distant cousins. dogs were decended from wolves. to see a dog turn into a horse would be surprising, but thats not the only example of macroevolution.\n \n a ring species is testable, verifiable evidence. genetics and geographic distribution can distinctively prove the branches of a ring species to be decended from the common northern salamander.\n \n on top of being open minded about this evidence, also pay attention to it and dont take irrelevant tangents like you just did. i took the time to show you, as you asked me to do, so why not listen?",

Why the double standard? Here's what I mean, you said this regarding DOGS:\n \n  [Bennedict] dogs. dogs are an extreme case of evolution in action. theyve come about by something called artificial selection - humans become the selecting agent, not natural forces. \n \n So, you are holding up selective breeding of dogs as an example that because we can do it by interbreeding dogs for certain physical attributes and personality characteristics, this is evidence of the process of evolution, right? Simply put, that was your whole point of referring to dogs as an extreme example of selective evolution. \n \n I simply expanded the premise by extending it to macroevolution which you yourself are endorsing as the mechanism by which we human beings exist. The valid question remains as to why, if cross breeding of dogs is evidence of evolution which you claim it is, and human beings are scientifically capable of accomplishing that feat, and if macroevolution is also real, then why can't we manipulate genes and alleles in order to artificially accomplish that also by artificially breeding a dog into a horse or any other type of species? I just pulled horse out of the air, you can apply the science to artificially create any example of macroevolution and I'll accept it as evidence that it can and has occurred. But you can't do that because the possibility only exists in the minds of deluded pseudo intellectuals such as you and the mental midgets who preach their philosophy of evolution here.\n \n \nevolution has never made any claim about abiogenesis. ive taken a few evolutionary biology classes (my major requires it), and never once have we even grazed on abiogenesis. if anything, biochemistry might, but certainly not zoology or evolution. its just a totally different area of study.\n\n \n Really? Next time try staying awake in class, ok? Or at least grow an honest bone in your body because you are either completely clueless or a downright liar. Here is a link to \"evolution 101\" and a quote from its explanation of evolution:\n An introduction to evolution \n \n Leaves on trees change color and fall over several weeks. Mountain ranges erode over millions of years.\n \n \n A genealogy illustrates change with inheritance over a small number of years. Over a large number of years, evolution produces tremendous diversity in forms of life.\n The definition\n Biological evolution, simply put, is descent with modification. This definition encompasses small-scale evolution (changes in gene frequency in a population from one generation to the next) and large-scale evolution (the descent of different species from a common ancestor over many generations). Evolution helps us to understand the history of life.\n \n The explanation\n Biological evolution is not simply a matter of change over time. Lots of things change over time: trees lose their leaves, mountain ranges rise and erode, but they aren't examples of biological evolution because they don't involve descent through genetic inheritance.\n \n The central idea of biological evolution is that all life on Earth shares a common ancestor, just as you and your cousins share a common grandmother.\n \n Through the process of descent with modification, the common ancestor of life on Earth gave rise to the fantastic diversity that we see documented in the fossil record and around us today. Evolution means that we're all distant cousins: humans and oak trees, hummingbirds and whales.Welcome to Evolution 101!\n \n So how dumb are you not to realize that an explanation for the introduction to evolution 101 very clearly asserts that the process of descent with modification, the common ancestor of life on Earth gave rise to the fantastic diversity that we see documented in the fossil record and around us today. Evolution means that we're all distant cousins: humans and oak trees, hummingbirds and whales. If this doesn't directly state that evolution begins with that original single celled organism that spontaneously appeared from the primordial ooze resulting in we human beings without specifically using those words, then I don't know what does. All one need do is extrapolate what is really being said here and not be in denial of what evolution actually claims. So I can't understand why you attempt to infer that evolution deals with what occurs only after abiogenesis occurred for debating purposes, when it accepts that it started when that alleged first single celled organism spontaneously appeared on a previously dead planet some 3.8 billion years ago.\n \n But admitting that would require intellectual honesty and we all know that you evolutionists completely lack that character trait.\n \n Also, before you cry foul and attempt to make excuses for and reinterpret what I'm showing you about what \"Evolution 101\" asserts in the Introduction, let's jump forward to the section on Macroevolution from the same lesson series. It offers this diagram which is undisputedly clear in its assertion of what macroevolution consists of:\n \n http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/images/evo/macroequation.gif\n \n It also says this in the same section:\n Macroevolution encompasses the grandest trends and transformations in evolution, such as the origin of mammals and the radiation of flowering plants.

   "Hold on just a second here, hypocrite; why is it ok for you to make giant leaps in your attempt to validate evolution, yet when I ask a similarly extreme question it is evidence of how little I know? Why the double standard? Here's what I mean, you said this regarding DOGS:\n \n  [Bennedict] dogs. dogs are an extreme case of evolution in action. theyve come about by something called artificial selection - humans become the selecting agent, not natural forces. \n \n So, you are holding up selective breeding of dogs as an example that because we can do it by interbreeding dogs for certain physical attributes and personality characteristics, this is evidence of the process of evolution, right? Simply put, that was your whole point of referring to dogs as an extreme example of selective evolution. \n \n I simply expanded the premise by extending it to macroevolution which you yourself are endorsing as the mechanism by which we human beings exist. The valid question remains as to why, if cross breeding of dogs is evidence of evolution which you claim it is, and human beings are scientifically capable of accomplishing that feat, and if macroevolution is also real, then why can't we manipulate genes and alleles in order to artificially accomplish that also by artificially breeding a dog into a horse or any other type of species? I just pulled horse out of the air, you can apply the science to artificially create any example of macroevolution and I'll accept it as evidence that it can and has occurred. But you can't do that because the possibility only exists in the minds of deluded pseudo intellectuals such as you and the mental midgets who preach their philosophy of evolution here.\n \n \n \n Really?

It just confirms that you are sloshing around like a hooked fish on the deck of a boat. You haven't a clue as to how to respond to my argument so you bring up this \"thousand years\" as if your example of extreme evolution requires such time to create new breeds of dogs.\n \n Look at reality for a second if you are capable of doing that; how many generations did it take to create a Cockapoos? Are you actually suggesting it took a thousand years? Or even 10 generations?

Since science is the process by which you claim extreme evolution occurs in dogs, then the same science should be capable of accomplishing macroevolution and breeding one species of mammal from another. We split genes in gene therapy, splice cells together and have mapped genomes so we have incredible amounts of knowledge in precisely these areas of science, so why can't we duplicate macroevolution? That should be an easy question for an intellectual superstar such as yourself. emoticon_rolleyes\n \n I'll even compromise with you since a foal is larger than the largest dog, it would be more reasonable to breed a dog from a horse via extreme macroevolution (using your terminology) for the sake of an easy delivery.

Simply put, Evolution 101 just declared in no uncertain terms that evolution is directly related to the process of abiogenesis no matter how much you deny that fallaciously promoted reality.\n \n Sure, it allegedly took more than a billion years for the very hot and molten earth to cool enough for abiogenesis to occur, but according to everyone involved it occurred around 3.5-3.8 Billion years ago. Here, from a source you'll respect:\n \n the first living things on Earth are thought to be single cell prokaryotes (which lack a cell nucleus), perhaps evolved from protobionts (organic molecules surrounded by a membrane-like structure).[2] The oldest ancient fossil microbe-like objects are dated to be 3.5 Ga (billion years old), approximately one billion years after the formation of the Earth itself.\n Abiogenesis - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",

The study of the naturalistic origins of life is called abiogenesis, and while scientists have not developed a clear explanation of how life might have developed from nonliving material, that has no impact on evolution. Even if life did not begin naturally but was started due to the intervention of some divine power, evolution would still stand on the evidence as our best explanation so far for how that life has developed. \n\n \n Evolution -- Abiogenesis -- Origin of Life\n \nAbiogenesis is about the origin of life. Evolution, technically, is about what happened after life arose on Earth.\n\n \n Evolution and Abiogenesis\n \nI would say that abiogenesis is not the same as biological evolution and it certainly isn't the same as \"Darwinian evolution\". I would argue that the origin of life was a spontaneous process that did not require anything out of the ordinary and certainly didn't require a supernatural being. However, I would also argue that biological evolution only began with the formation of the first population of living cells.\n\n \n CB090: Evolution without abiogenesis\n \nThe theory of evolution applies as long as life exists. How that life came to exist is not relevant to evolution.\n\n \n Abiogenesis - RationalWiki\n \nAbiogenesis and evolution are two different things. The theory of evolution says absolutely nothing about the origin of life. It merely describes the processes which take place once life has started up. There may also be multiple pathways to producing naturally occurring \"life\". Depending, of course, on the definition of life. \n\n \n Abiogenesis - SkepticWiki\n \nAbiogenesis is separate from the question of Theory of Evolution, although many creationists do not properly make the distinction. However, the Theory of Evolution properly only addresses the question of how life changes over time once it has already arisen, leaving questions of the origin of life alone.\n\n \n a ctrl-f \"abiogenesis\" of all of the pages on the UC Berkley \"Understanding Evolution\" website that YOU POSTED turned up nil. surely if evolution and abiogenesis are weaved together, the website which YOU POSTED to prove that point should have at least one reference to abiogenesis. but it does not. your point has been disproven by the very resource you used to try to prove it... again. third time now, i think. you arent very good at this debating business, are you?\n \n are you prepared to say that all of these resources are incorrect just because you say so? the fact is abiogenesis is not in the evolutionary biology cirriculum at any level. abiogenesis is not an area of study and research for evolutionary biologists. abiogenesis is not necessary for someone to study and research evolutionary biology. like all proper scientific theories, the two compliment each other, but they are not linked or dependant on one another in any way. like i said, i highly doubt they are even in the same fields - abiogenesis being presumably a part of biochemistry.\n \n wait a minute:\n \n \ni have used a simple evolution 101 sites definition of what it entails as a so called science to prove that abiogenesis is an integral part of the theory until you people are forced to actually defend it.\n\n \n 1: no you havent. youve used the site's definition to show that macroevolution is a part of the theory of evolution - well done. no where does it say anything about abiogenesis; using the actual term or not.\n \n 2: the above, as well as my previous two or three posts are a defense of abiogenesis: evolution secularism. ive defended my point, go ahead and respond.",

They cohabited with modern humans for thousands of years before becoming extinct about 29,000 years ago. Since 1999, several DNA samples have been extracted from Neanderthal fossils and sequenced, allowing scientists to compare large sections of the Neanderthal genome with that of modern humans. This is possible because DNA fragments can survive for 50,000 to 100,000 years.\n \n Neanderthal DNA sequences were found to be about 99.5% similar to the modern human genome, indicating that modern humans and Neanderthals had a common ancestor about 700,000 years ago. The genetic difference between Neanderthals and modern humans, however, was on average about three times greater than the genetic difference between any two modern humans. Studies of the mtDNA of nearly 80,000 people found no traces of mutations known to be common in Neanderthal mtDNA. These differences indicate no significant interbreeding between Neanderthals and modern humans after the two species diverged. \n",

They cohabited with modern humans for thousands of years before becoming extinct about 29,000 years ago. Since 1999, several DNA samples have been extracted from Neanderthal fossils and sequenced, allowing scientists to compare large sections of the Neanderthal genome with that of modern humans. This is possible because DNA fragments can survive for 50,000 to 100,000 years.\n \n Neanderthal DNA sequences were found to be about 99.5% similar to the modern human genome, indicating that modern humans and Neanderthals had a common ancestor about 700,000 years ago. The genetic difference between Neanderthals and modern humans, however, was on average about three times greater than the genetic difference between any two modern humans. Studies of the mtDNA of nearly 80,000 people found no traces of mutations known to be common in Neanderthal mtDNA. These differences indicate no significant interbreeding between Neanderthals and modern humans after the two species diverged.\n\n \n eyes open, EZ.",

   "Here's just one example:\n \n http://www.evidencebible.com/witnessingtool/evolution.gif\n\n But it's a stupid example. Every pane is just another lie.\n \n Pane 1: No experts agree that \"Lucy\" was just a chimpanzee. Only dishonest creationists make such claims.\n \n Pane 2: Just stupid! In fact, the earliest fossil of what has been called Homo heidelbergensis was a jaw discovered in 1907. Only an XXXXX creationist would concede that it \"is quite human.\" Later fossil finds of many skulls and skeletal remains have determined that the type fossil was a male of a species in which the females were much more gracile, and much more similar to modern humans. Heidelberg Man is more commonly known as archaic Homo sapiens today. HERE is a picture of the Heidelberg jaw along with a modern human skull.\n \n Pane 3: Nebraska Man was a media event. Pig teeth (omnivore) and human teeth (omnivore) are quite similar. The tooth was never published in a scientific journal - only in newspapers. The next year the the error was discovered when much of the remaining skeleton was discovered. This was not a claim of science - although it is now a claim made by creationists. Compare it to \"Lucy\", discovered in 1974, and yet the preliminary description was not published until 1976. This was actually light speed when compared to other publications of significant scientific discoveries. Nebraska man? A bogus newspaper story and a creationist event.\n \n Pane 4: Piltdown? Give me a break. The second non-claim by evolutionary biologists in this little cartoon. Piltdown Man was touted by the British, rejected by the rest of Europe, and viewed with skepticism in the U.S. The rest of the world took no notice. It lost all credibility when other hominid fossils were discovered in Africa and Asia. By the time that the technology was developed to definitively demonstrate that it was a fraud, no one but creationists gave it any credence.\n \n Pane 5: All evidence for Peking Man has disappeared? What a load of XXXX! It is true that the original fossils of \"Peking Man\" were lost during WWII. This is, of course, evidence that they didn't exist at all for a creationist. However, excellent casts of the original fossils have been preserved, as well as subsequent fossils discoveries in the same fossil beds, as well as other discoveries in other parts of the world. These fossils are so similar that they are almost indistinguishable. Peking Man is now known as Homo erectus and fossils have been found from Africa to the Levant to India to China.\n \n Pane 6: The claim that the specimen suffered from arthritis is correct. But that doesn't mean that it was just a modern old man. The claim is stupid in the extreme. There have been many Neanderthal skeletons that have been discovered. Funny that creationists should dwell on the oldest and cling to an uninformed opinion of that fossil. Only creationists claim that Neanderthals were our ancestors.\n \n Pane 7: New Guinea Man: What? I'm not sure of what this is suppose to mean. Skull fragments dated to about 5,000 years were found in New Guinea. These fragments were classified as Homo sapiens. They are human. They are us.\n \n Pane 8: Of course, Cro-Mangon Man has never been claimed to be anything other than modern human. They have been dated from about 10,000 years to about 30,000 years ago. With remnants so recent, it has been possible to extract large amounts of DNA from some of these fossils. The analysis has shown that Cro-Magnons are us.\n \n Pane 9: We didn't \"come from monkey's.\" We do share a common ancestor with monkeys and apes. DNA analysis has shown that this is true. Our closest relatives in the ape world are the chimpanzees (two species), followed by the gorilla and then the orang.\n \n That little cartoon is just the sort of thing that creationists cling to. It more than ignorant and shows an unwillingness to educate oneself. Rather than question mythology, it is better to be stupid.",
