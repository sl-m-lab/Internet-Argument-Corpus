   "I have been noticing lately that a LOT of revisions in major US economic numbers have been coming out, and they are all negative. A couple examples JUST from today (off my forex news ticker):\n \n \nUS Aug new home sales have hit the 1.05mln forecast, but Jul's data shows a sharp downward revision to 1.009mln. That is likely to lend the Usd a soft tone, but is probably unlikely to change the overall tendency to bid downticks. That said, talk of sovereign bids around 1.2650 in Eur/Usd and 1.2600 DNT limit defense are likely to provide good resistance to further Usd gains. Long Usd/Jpy positions look a better bet, the next hurdle being a mix of offers and stops around 117.50. \n\n \n \n[US DURABLE GOODS DATA - UNHAPPY REVISIONS] The August data were softer than expected, and the revision to prior months only made things worse. Revisions to non-transport orders were all lower, and the August figure was down 2.0% so non-transport orders are considerably softer than had been thought. What had been reported as a 15.1% y/y gain in non-trans orders in July is now put at just 5.2%. core capital goods have the same look at non-trans orders. Down in the latest month, revised down in prior months. Rather than July's initially report of a 14.4% y/y rise in July, we now see a 6.6% rise. Shipments of core capital goods, though up 1.3% in August, were revised lower in the prior 2 months, which means downward revisions to capital spending estimates for Q3 GDP. \n\n \n Going back, EVERY major set of economic data that has been released by our government in the past 5 months has later been revised downward, except for debt, which later ends up being revised upward. \n \n Now, you expect some revision in economic data, but from 1.072 (julys number) to 1.009 on new home sales??? WTF??? They just count the new home sales. There is nothing to get wrong.\n \n Durable goods orders off 8-10% YtY???\n \n Somehting is seriously not right here.",

As the US fiscal year ends this month with a crucial national election right around the corner, it's not surprising current administration has been turning up heat in cooking the books. The public doesn't care, many still trust the government. Worse, many still trust government numbers that would imprison a business person.",

   "I just read the August new home numbers and am still amazed people are stupid enough to be excited by a government news release stating things were better than expected. Just lost the hand and not the arm?

It was pointed out to me last night that incentives such as free kitchen upgrades, landscaping, flooring upgrades, and vehicle leases (one builder in Kansas City is offering a 2 yr BMW lease for free if you buy their homes) is not included in that. I did a little poking around today and found that most of my industry contacts are saying that incentives equal to 15% of the homes sales price has become the norm, but when it comes to homes that have been sitting for more than 4 months, doubling that is not uncommon.",

One popular incentive is now the lease to buy option. They're taking people who can't qualify for loans, leasing them the house (new) for a monthly payment that services their land and construction loans. The obvious hope being interest rates coming down enough to qualify them while eating tax and insurance costs for the term of the lease. \n \n If the builder is operating on a 15% profit margin, that's about $45k he has to play with to stay solvent. Nothing in the $300-900k segment is moving. Kind of a strange feeling driving through a new development with $600k homes sitting finished, landscaped and empty with the interest clocks running.",

With the lease not covering devaluation, I can see a world of hurt ahead for a lot of builders in that scenario.
