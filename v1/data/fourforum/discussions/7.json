You ask say that if it is something else then it is not human, but thats not the issue, of course it is human, but is it a human being??? Of course it will  become  a human being (barring miscarriage or abortion), but is it in the first trimester? Second? Third? When does the fetus go from a clump of cells to a human being?? Does it become a HUMAN BEING at the moment of conception when the sperm hits the egg? That point has to be defined and it has yet to be defined somewhere that is satisfactory for both parties. Pro-lifers are all over the board saying the moment of concpetion, when it becomes a zygote, when it becomes an embryo etc, etc, etc. Pro-choicers pretty much agree that it is at the point of viability. When the fetus can survive outside the womb (even with help of modern technology) it is viable and at that point abortion is illegal except in cases where the mothers life is endanger.

You ask say that if it is something else then it is not human, but thats not the issue, of course it is human, but is it a human being??? \n\n \n Your proposal makes no sense. Are you speaking human being as in when it is an individual human being? Well then, this is a seperate issue. Let's discuss this. \n \n \nOf course it will become a human being (barring miscarriage or abortion), but is it in the first trimester? Second? Third? When does the fetus go from a clump of cells to a human being??\n\n \n It's kind of silly that you call it a \"clump of cells\", as we are all clumps of cells! Everything is made up of cells! Just because it doesn't look like a human being, doesn't mean it isn't one. In fact, there is absolutely no species of any life form that is created in the same form, size, and bodily functions and stays that way. I'm really sorry, but beings don't just pop out of nowhere, they are always there. You didn't evolve from a fetus, you were a fetus. This is philisophically and scientifically sound, and thus you are saying that at one time you were not a human being. This is simply a ludecrous statement, and thus collapses your argument. But now I will forget this, and act as if though I never debated that. I will now answer your question: When does it become a human being?\n \n Firstly, if you mean a personal being, not all children are born with personality. In fact, many babies are born every year with a serious form of brain damage called a vegetative stage. In this stage, the baby is born, as the fetus was, without any personality. The now born baby relies on everybody to feed it, and the baby cannot think, and can only lay flat and at the most move it's eyes (although it is completely blind). In some occations this vegetative person can revive from this horrible mess, although not completely, but it can at least walk around. \n \n \nPro-choicers pretty much agree that it is at the point of viability. When the fetus can survive outside the womb (even with help of modern technology) it is viable and at that point abortion is illegal except in cases where the mothers life is endanger. \n\n \n This belief is stupified by simply understanding this: Everybody relies on something. Simply because the baby cannot survive outside of the mother's womb doesn't mean that the baby isn't human. A baby cannot survive without the mother to feed it and raise it, is the baby not a human until he can graduate from college and have sex by twenty-one? Of course not! A baby is always a human, just like the fetus is always a human. You don't become human, you always are human. You don't need a personality to become a human.",

   "I don't think it should be allowed, I just question whether making it illegal would be pushing religious ethics onto others, which is considered wrong it out country. While I can argue pro-life with out bringing religion into it, deep down my opposition to abortion roots from my religion. I am VERY against abortion because I feel you are playing God (same reasons I am against cloning etc.). If the baby is supposed to miscarriage and die before it is born fine, but a person have no right to choose that. If the mother is going to die in childbirth, and the child lives, (or even both die for that matter) then yes, that is said, but people are not God and have no right to act as such. It is God's decision who lives and dies, not pregnant mothers. Since that is the REAL reason I am strongly opposed to abortion, I have to wonder if by thinking abortion should be illegal I am pushing my religious views on others. It is a religious decision, and religious decisions are protected under out Constitutions Freedom of Religion. That's my only problem. \n \n Of course, if I were raped and I got pregnant, I cannot swear to what I would do, because I have never been in that situation so I cannot say exactly what I would do. I would like to say I would carry the child to full term and put it up for adoption, but I can't guarantee that. I don't think any girl, no matter what religion, background, or belief can honestly stand up and say \"I am against abortion, and I will NEVER have one\" unless that have been in that situation. Many of us would like to believe we would stick to our morals and trust in God (if religious) but you can't swear that until it happens to you.\n \n So, I don't really think it should be legal, I just question whether it is right under our constitution to make it illegal.\n \n BTW--may I ask if you are a male or female???",

Talking about how cruel and wrong it is and giving some statistics, but the majority of the adds would be pictures for emotional shock value. Then there would be the prochoicers. They would not only focus on the fact that it isn't a baby, and that a woman has the right to do what she wants with her own body, they would also use slippery slope argument that if we take the right of abortion away all these other rights will be lost.

   "Originally posted by Calligirl \n You can't say that making abortion illegal would be \"forcing our religious beliefs on others\". What about the teaching of evolution in school? \n\n That's a really bad parallel...teaching evolution in school (while not teaching creationism) would be parallel to teaching that a fetus is a baby (and not that is isn't). Making abortion illegal is more like if we made Creationism illegal, and you weren't allowed to believe it. Even when I was a Creationist I still believed that Creationism was taught right where is should have been...church. But there are better parallels, like I said, how would you feel if one day it was suddenly declared that the Jews of our nation had voted to make it illegal to eat unkosher things. No more gelatin (which is in A LOT of candy), no more pork, no more swordfish, no more shellfish, no more milk with meat, meat prices would skyrocket. How would you feel??? Probably you wouldn't be pleased since a belief you don't hold would be being forced on you.\n \n I'd call that a \"religious belief\" being forced on Christian students. \n\n Right the whole evolution is a \"religous belief\" argument... Is chemistry a \"religious belief?\" How about Physics???? I never really understood this whole \"should creationism be taught in schools\" business...I mean good grief what would they teach????? \n \n \nI think that partial birth abortion is definitely going to be made illegal this year. As for other abortion methods, hopefully they will be made illegal in the future as well.\n\n You are more than likely right about the partial birth abortion and I said that one, as for the others, while I would like to see it, I seriously doubt it will happen very soon.\n \n \n\n I hope you are right! (About Bush replacing one or two in the Supreme Court.) :) \n\n Yeah but they have to die or retire first, and let me tell you the liberal ones left know what will happen and they are not going to voluntarily retire while Bush is in office.",

   "Originally posted by Sarah \n You don't have to tell me that, I agree with you, but I seriously doubt abortion will be made (entirely)...I say entirely because aspects of abortion may be made illegal, AKA third trimester abortions, partial birth abortion, etc. etc. etc, ...but I doubt there will be a law which outlaws it entirely anytime soon. \n\n \n \n I totally agree with you. It's an incredibly touchy subject for politicians to play with. Too many of them are looking out for their reelection campaigns to be decisive on such a controversial issue.",
