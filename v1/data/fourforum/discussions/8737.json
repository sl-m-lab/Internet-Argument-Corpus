   "In another thread somebody was talking about our strong economy. I was agreed that it would be inappropriate to launch a full discussion, thus hijacking another thread.\n \n Jim asked me to show that tax cuts do not help the economy. The simple answer to that is that in all reality, we do not really know for sure if tax cuts help he economy or not because we have never seen them in a vacuum. Even during the Reagan era, tax cuts were coupled with slowed growth of the government. While it the government continued to grow, it was at a remarkably slower pace than during the carter years.\n \n Typically, you can expect to see increased consumer spending, leading to increased government revenue (since the government gets a bite out of every transaction) when you cut taxes. The exceptions to this tend to be when your consumers are already spending based on debt and when there has been a prolonged period of wage deflation. We have seen both in the US. Probably one of the best examples of this was in Argentina, when prior to their collapse US economists recommended cutting taxes as a means of spurring economic activity, thus increasing government revenue. The move led to the collapse of the Argentinian economy and the default of their debt.\n \n The real question is whether the current round of tax cuts are going to be especially good for the economy. This is a whole new can of worms, because no American president has ever been stupid enough to push though massive tax cuts while simultaneously pushing the largest expansion of US government spending in history barring a world war. \n \n So, really, whether tax cuts are going to help your economy, or just forestall the inevitable while making things worse in the long run, is largely a function of how healthy your economy is to begin with. When our industrial infrastructure was still intact, and demand for expansion capital was high, tax cuts tended to spur the economy not only because they gave consumers more to spend on good old American made goods, but they allowed Americans to invest in our infrastructure (in the form of IPOs and corporate bonds), providing much needed expansion capital. Demand for expansion capital is, and has been, flat in the US for several years...over a decade. \n \n The one thing that we CAN say for certain is that the tax breaks increased our trade deficit. People took all that money they got back form their taxes and bought Chinese goods with them. So, that money went to china and they are using to expand their infrastructure, which they will inevitably use to drive American manufacturers further into the ground.\n \n As far as whether the economy as a whole is strong.....Well, the dollar has fallen 2% in the last month, which is a pretty good indicator that the worlds central banks and large cap traders do not think so. We continue to see decreased indirect bids in our bond auction, which shows that other governments do not think our economy is especially strong. People are afraid that interest rates at 5.5% will crush our economy, which is a bad sign as well. We are seeing economic slowdown, BUT inflation is still increasing. People celebrated this month to see inflation increase ONLY .4%, BUT that is a .4% INCREASE. It is now sitting at 2.4% using even our heavily cooked inflationary reporting scheme.\n \n There is a reason that the fed called 1-2% their \"comfort zone\" We cannot handle much more than that. Almost as interesting as the amount of the inflationary increase was its composition. While we remove food and energy from inflationary figures (core CPI...l.because apparently you do not REALLY have to eat or have electricity), the food and energy increase was interesting and, IMO, telling. over 80% of the increase on the \"discarded\" food and energy side was NOT energy, it was food. Food is of course up due to the fact that our food production is energy intensive, and prices at the supermarket are just starting to catch up to prices in the field. This likely means that we are in for a protracted period of inflation at least partly driven by food price increases. Bad news for the poor, and for the economy as a whole because even if we get a reasonable decrease in energy prices (I would not bank on that), the \"discarded\" side of the inflationary figures will likely continue to be driven higher by food prices.\n \n It could be pointed out that we are currently seeign across the board yield inversion, which is, as far as I know, the most reliabel indicator of recession, but that is kind of Lord Tammerlins horse. I will let him beat it.",

   "Tax cuts, can help the economy or they can do nothing or in fact they can hurt the economy.\n \n If a country has comparatively high taxes that are driving investment to other countries then a tax cut can be very benificial. Ireland is a good example of this where low corporate taxes have helped push Ireland to strong economic growth.\n \n If a country has competitive or lower taxes then other competing nations then a tax cut is most likely going to be a wash. It would not likely drive any new investment in the country as the compartive rates would not likely be enough of a change to offset the extra borrowing costs, and slower governmental spending.\n \n Tax cuts in an overheating economy could push it into overdrive eventually causing a very hard crash.",

Why else would the yield curve (the term structure of interest rates) have flattened so that yields on the two-year Treasury note equaled and at times exceeded the yield on the ten-year note? \n \n \n snip\n \n Economists soon discovered that if they compared the yield on these TIPS with the plain-vanilla instruments, they had a pretty good idea of the bond market's thinking when it came to inflation expectations. This became even more important as yields on the ten-year note began to drift perilously close to the rate of inflation, instead of hovering their usual three points above. See August 1 column. \n When bond buyers worry about inflation, they rush to buy TIPS, rather than the regular Treasuries. This drives up their price and pushes down their yield -- both in absolute terms and when compared with the yield on the plain-vanilla note. The bigger this spread, the more bond buyers are worried about inflation. \n Guess what? From 2.3 percentage points at the start of this year, the spread between the regular ten-year note and the ten-year TIPS has widened steadily, reaching 2.7 points at the start of this week. That's one of the biggest spreads since early 1998. It parallels the steady pickup in the core rate of inflation, from 2% earlier this year, to almost 2.4% today. \n By signaling both a slowdown and a pickup in inflation, the bond market could be trying to have it both ways. Or, it could be looking for the combination of these two trends, stagflation, as I opined back on Aug. 8. See earlier column. \n\n Just a reminder of something Daewoo has talked about earlier",

   "Tax cuts don't happen in a vacuum. Unless you're running a surplus, you need to cut spending to pay for them. If you cut public sector jobs in favour of tax cuts for the rich, chances are you're going to damage the economy because the rich will sit on their money for the most part, instead of it going into the pockets of generally fairly low paid public employees who will spend it and boost the economy that way. Secondly a lot of public spending that will be victims of cuts under most governments (given that it is generally right wing government) will be ones that benefit the public at large and indirectly support the economy, such as healthcare and education.\n \n The idea that cutting taxes automatically boosts revenues is completely inaccurate, the laffer curve states that there is a tipping point beyond which raising taxes causes revenues to fall, but there is nothing to suggest that any western economy, and certainly not the terminally undertaxed US economy, is beyond this point.",

It angers me sometimes that these people who have more opportunities now than other people ever had to educate themselves just willfully choose to remain ignorant.\n\n \n First, this place isn't that bad. There are a couple of other forums I occasionally visit (ok, troll) where they have several people who are so stupid that it is physically painful to read their posts. Want to see people argue, and actually believe, that dollar valuation has no effect on commodity prices, or that israel has never violated a ceasefire, or that the palestenians actually invaded and ar occupying their little slice of israel (thats my favorite), I know a forum where you can see people honestly argue all those viewpoints. \n \n Willful ignorance is, IMO, a defense mechanism. You have to understand that most americans have \"we are the greatest nation that has ever been\" pounded into their head from birth. Supposedly the US has a great, unstoppable economy, everybody on the planet loves us for our acts of charity, and it is our god given right to be wealthy, and for even our unemployed to live better than people who work 80 hours per week in other parts of the world. \"America\" is, in their minds, directly tied to everything good and pure and wholesome in the world. \n \n The reality, of course, is very different. In relaity, any pride we may have in our country is actually pride in the actions of our grandfathers, beause we have pretty much done very little but destroy it in the last 30 years. We have dismantled and sold off our industrial infrastructure, which means it is unlikely that our view of our economy as unstoppable is corrupt, as well as the idea that our layabouts, or even our workers, automatically deserve a higher quality of life than those who work twice as hard in other parts of the world. The concept of America standing ofr everythign good and pure in the owrld is difficult to reconcile with the reality of dictitorial support that has resulted int he death of tens, if not hundreds, of millions.\n \n This is why our response to the 9/11 attacks was so severe. That was a little bit of reality slapping us right in the face. Here we were sitting around thinking about how everybody on the planet loves us for our generosity, and a bunch of folks blew up a couple of our skyscrapers, suggesting that we are NOT universally loved. For many Americans, that is the first time since Carter was in the white house that they actually had to look at our foreign policy. I think that most people, even Americans, recognize that supporting tyrants and dictators and engaging in foreign policy that results in the death of millions is not a very good thing to do. You might even call it UnAmerican. Rather than accept this, they will themseleves into ignorance.\n \n It really is sad.\n \n \nAs for my personal health (:P), thankfully I wasn't there when the #### hit the fan. I'll be going there again as soon as possible though. It kinda depends on when the airport is fully functional again.\n\n \n I am glad that you were not sitting in downtown Beirut when they started bombing. If you are going to wait for the airport to be fully functional, it might be a while. I saw some pictures the other day, and Israel bombed the hell out of the airport. I would imagine based on the photos that I saw that it wil take a few months at the very least to get the runways patched.",
