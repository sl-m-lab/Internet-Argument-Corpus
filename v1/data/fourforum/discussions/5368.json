   "I agree, but often I discuss this with theists and they often come out with the following -\n \n 1.

God is all powerful and all knowing BUT he can't see the future.\n \n I respond by saying that if God knows everything then he knows the location and velocity of every particle in the universe hence he can perfectly predict the future using his 'godly intellect'.\n \n I also point to the multiverse theory that there exists a dimension which is identical as our own but at every other point in time hence allowing 'someone' to see the past or 'the future'.\n \n The last three pages of this thread has a discussion between me and Big Orn about this exact topic -- would you like to take a look Duo?\n \n [My first comment relating to it starts at the end of post #152 & then skip down to the end of post #161 and continue on to #165 paying attention Big Orn and my posts.\n \n Specifically though the discussion desn't really get going until this post ]",

   "From the thread I linked too --\n \n \nGod being all knowing considers making a man, he looks into this man's future and sees that if this man is made he will eventually find his way back to God, God makes/forms/constructs the man content in the knowledge that the mortal will of his own will return to and love his creator.\n \n God considers making another man, again God looks into the man's future and sees the man will never find his way back to God and will become ever more disheartened with life and die after much suffering. God pauses and being a God of love is upset for this man he might make who will never find his way back to Him.\n \n Now for some strange unkown reason this God of love descides it'll be a 'good idea' to make this man anyway despite knowing the man will never find his way back to his creator and will suffer greatly in his existance.\n \n The question is why?\n\n \n \n\n Yes only God can answer why He on purpose creates people when he already knows before creating them that they will suffer and not find their way to him!\n \n He knows yet this 'loving' God does it anyway!\n \n This 'loving' God then judges these people even though he knew before creating them that they would not find their way back to him!\n \n This God contradicts the loving nature the Bible describes doesn't He?\n \n So either the Bible is wrong about God being all knowing or it is wrong about this God being a 'loving God'.\n \n Or of course He might not in fact exist at all making the Bible wrong and God non existant...\n\n \n \n \n \nAnyone who says they don't have free will choices is just being silly.
