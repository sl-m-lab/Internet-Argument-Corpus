   "Five Myths About Intervention\n \n by Karl Kammler\n \n Two of the most prosperous nations in the world are Sweden and Switzerland. They mind their own business and amazingly no one wants to blow up their commercial jets. They also don't have a huge national debt resulting from attempts to be global policemen. Despite these clear examples of successful isolationism, there are countless kosher conservatives telling us that we must support \"interventionism\" and get even further involved in the Third World, even though our needless support of Israel is responsible for ALL our problems with the Muslim world.\n \n Consider the five \"myths of interventionism\" listed below. There are surely more than just five, but these are the ones parroted most often by Americans, who have bought the usual pro-Israel propaganda.\n \n \n Myth One: \"America has interests overseas.\"\n \n Liberals and conservatives both claim that America has certain key overseas interests, which they rarely define except for the two obvious sacred cows of American politics: oil and Israel. They write themselves blank checks on America's finite treasure and precious blood, and the only beneficiaries are the multinational corporations, international bankers, powerful ethnic lobbies (such as the Israeli lobby), and liberal \"do-gooders\" who pour our money into Third World countries like a madman trying to change the ocean by pouring buckets of fresh water into it.\n \n America's true, paramount interest is maintaining our national sovereignty and independence as a recognizable, distinct nation. This can only be accomplished by strict control of our borders. Unfortunately this is the one thing that our sell-out politicians have deliberately failed to do.\n \n The typical empire, before its final collapse, neglects the home country and focuses obsessively on foreign lands. Our politicians are following in the same footsteps as the last Roman emperors.\n \n \n Myth Two: \"We spread freedom to the people of the world\"\n \n At home, the imperial character of our foreign policy grows the government, magnifying the power of the executive branch in particular. The resentment toward American interference ultimately results in armed resistance against us. Americans had to fight rebels in the Philippines when we occupied that country, and our attempt to force democracy on Vietnam with our military locked us into a war of attrition that lasted thirteen years over there. Our conflict with the Muslim world is demanding more troops on the ground in more countries, and another war of attrition has begun. A vicious circle is born in which the nation must dedicate ever more power and resources to try to suppress foreign nationals, who want us out of their countries. While we supposedly deliver freedom to others, we become less free at home.\n \n Few stop to think that the foreign policy elites like Condoleeza Rice and Paul Wolfowitz say and do things to perpetuate their own jobs. Too many people actually trust the government. The \"enemy of the month\" is currently Iraq; previously it was the Noriega and the Panamese, Qadafi and the Libyans, Russians, and the Germans before them. The script never really changes. There is always a 'boogeyman' out there, from Kaiser Wilhelm, to Adolf Hitler, to Osama bin Laden, to Saddam Hussein.\n \n \n Myth Three: \"The world is dangerous, and our enemies will attack this country!\"\n \n Americans who advocate an interventionist foreign policy tend to put America at the center of the world. They seem to think that every country on this planet can't wait to cross the ocean and attack us. Why do the interventionists consider America something so coveted by the rest of the world? Why wouldn't the \"enemy of the month\" invade Australia or Brazil instead? Why would any country attack or invade a massive nation situated between two oceans that has a large, heavily armed population?\n \n Foreign countries desperately try to stay away from the United States, not come toward us. Serbia, for example, did not attack the United States or even display any kind of interest in Americans. The United States attacked Serbia because Bill Clinton needed a distraction from one of his many scandals. Iraq also never attacked the United States. The Iraqis would have been happy to sell us Kuwaiti oil at market prices. The availability of oil was never threatened by Iraq's occupation of Kuwait, but all our politicians told us different. We were fed nothing but lies about Iraq when the real issue was that Israel did not want Kuwait's oil profits going into the Iraqi military. Israel has 200 H-bombs and they basically ordered our politicians to wage war on Iraq so that they could maintain their nuclear monopoly. Americans constantly poke around in other nations' backyards. Foreign countries rightfully resent this --they don't want the U.S. acting as judge, jury and executioner over them.\n \n Interventionism is more dangerous to the continuance of this nation than any potential series of terrorist attacks. Kosher conservatives dismiss any opponent of the new American Imperialism as a \"crackpot,\" an \"America hater\" or a \"terrorist sympathizer.\" Say anything different from the official globalist cheer-leading chants and you are accused of trying to damage the country.\n \n Interventionists cannot see that the more America meddles overseas, the greater the chance that something tragic will happen. They propose ever more bold and dangerous military adventures, as if they think the United States is invincible. Then, in the next breath they tell you how dangerous the world is and how precarious America's position is, which contradicts the whole invincibility aura. Suddenly a superpower has to worry about countries like North Korea, whose average citizen barely subsists on a bowl of rice a day.\n \n \n Myth Four: \"America is a superpower.\"\n \n One would think that America's \"superpower status\" would help alleviate the interventionists' fears of encirclement. Are we a superpower? Are there any other indicators of superpower status besides a huge military? Quality of life, maybe? How about our infrastructure, or the level of education of our population?\n \n Why do these advocates of military adventurism think that it's okay for Americans to be taxed to fund foreign countries or to send American boys to fight other people's wars?\n \n Taxpayer dollars, rather than benefiting Americans, are instead shipped overseas for the enrichment of foreigners. Conservatives claim to oppose wealth redistribution schemes characteristic of the welfare state here at home, yet they all too often support these schemes at the international level. They think it's normal for the U.S. to dictate to other countries what kind of government they should have. All of this is done in the name of freedom, supposedly. America calls out to the nations of the world, \"you will become a democracy\" while our Bill of Rights is shredded by the Office of Homeland Security.\n \n \n Myth Five: \"If you don't like the policy of this country, you're free to leave!\"\n \n Kosher conservatives tell us if we disagree with American foreign policy, then we should leave the country. \"Love it or leave it\" is the good old retort of the defender of the status quo. However, if anyone leaves America, would that free him of politically correct imperialism? What if someone unhappy with Clinton moved to Serbia, only to have bombs rain down on his head as Clinton demands that Serbia must allow in as many Albanian illegal aliens as America allows in illegal Mexicans.\n \n Basically we have no choice, we can make a stand and fight political correctness here in America or we can flee to another country only to have open borders, gun control and \"gay rights\" forced on us under threat of war by presidents like Clinton and Bush.\n \n \n Source:\n \n http://www.originaldissent.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1838\n \n \n \n .",

This country has not gained territory in a long time even when it might have and is not the supreme authority over any other nation's government unless one includes economic coercion which is not strictly \"imperial\".\n\n \n I agree with your textbook definition of empire building as it relates to historical instances with geographical occupation. I believe our empire building is based on financial and military control. With the exception of Afghanistan and Iraq (true nation building), the loyalty of our 'coalition' is primarily based on direct financial and military aid and trade loan guarantees. In many cases, Spain, Australia, UK and others, the leaders of those countries are acting against public sentiment in supporting our unilateral aggression in Afghanistan and Iraq. As none of those countries are directly threatened by the countries we've invaded/occupied, I'd call that imperialism without the necessity of occupation as versus ally, where countries come to the aid of a fellow ally because the 'enemy' also threatens their well-being. \n \n Regardless of how one defines our actions, we're over-extending our resources in a dangerous financial manner against a perceived or defined threat (WMDs and Islamic desire for removing our power trip presence from the ME), which has always been the downfall of past empires. The only difference between physical occupation using mercenaries or one's own troops and just financing control over a government is, IMO, a moot point.",

   "I'm not sure about Switzerland, but Sweden also has one of the highest foreign aid budgets (as a percentage of GDP) in the world. It does take an \"interventionist\" approach, but in its own way. I know you don't approve of that manner, since you oppose US financial support for Israel. But the goodwill Sweden's earned amongst the community of nation can be at least as ascribed to its proactive actions (foreign aid) as its inactive actions (non-intervention). That Swedish paratroopers tend to not rain down on other nations is a function of the fact that they have a small population and military. Not that I think Sweden would become a militaristic giant if it suddenly had a population boom (Viking Raiders, redux!). But the point is its an apples/oranges analogy: Sweden and the US are very different nations, in more ways than how you described. I'm doubtful, for example, that you would be as willing to ascribe Sweden's success to its relatively liberal immigration and asylum policies...\n \n I'll agree that US intervention in foreign nations makes us a target. That's about as relevant as saying police busts make cops targets for the mafia. It's true, but it doesn't mean that the police should acquiesce to crime. At some point, being the biggest boy on the block places some responsibilities on our shoulder. If the US doesn't do it, then the body responsible for maintaining global security will be the UN, and I KNOW y'all don't want that to happen.\n \n What's absolutely stunning here is that there has been almost zero discussion about US moral obligations. Everything is being framed in a realist prism (with the exception of PNACs genocide caveat, and Siegfriedson doesn't even concede that, with his opposition to the Kosovo intervention). Yet, US moral obligations can be linked to our realist needs. Its undeniable that if the entire world was to morph into a bunch of liberal democracies tommorow, we'd be better off (democracies tend to have higher economic productivity, are more inclined to trade, are less inclined to fight with each other, and in general produce less negative externalities that harm the rest of the world). Isolationsim has realist oppurtunity costs. If I walk past a pond where a child is drowning, and I do nothing and keep walking, not only am I morally at fault for that child's death, but his family probably is quite angry with me for failing to save his life when it was within my power. Similarily, when the US allows gross human rights violations to occur, and the victimized KNOW we could stop it, that too engenders hate and resentment towards the US that translates to terrorism. Sweden gets a pass because of its massive foreign aid budget and the fact that people know it can't, realistically, intervene. The US doesn't have that excuse. Siegfriedson presents isolationism as if it had no oppurtunity costs, but that just isn't the case. Global isolationism allowed the rise of fascist regimes in Germany, Italy, and Japan, yet it didn't stop us from being sucked into their wars of aggression. The US can confront the forces of hate now or later, and I prefer now.\n \n The secondary question is: Can US interventionism work? Are the longterm benefits that interventionism is supposed to bring (democratization and liberalization) feasible? The answer is, absolutely, and this has been empirically proven. Hoover Institute fellow Larry Diamond notes \n\"[T]he overwhelming bulk of the states that have become democratic during the third wave [of democratization, from 1974-1991] have remained so, even in countries lacking virtually all of the supposed \"conditions\" for democracy. ... [O]nly 14 of the 125 democracies that have existed during the third wave have become authoritarian, and in nine of these, democracy has since been restored.\"\n\n At a minimum, this suggests that the difficulty with which liberal values can be exported to the developing world has been vastly overstated (Drezner 2003). \n Daniel Drezner, Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of Chicago continues \nBut what of governments imposed via military occupation? Surely they're the exception to this optimistic rule. Actually, the empirical evidence of the last 50 years is rather evenly split on the question. Postwar Germany, Japan, Bosnia, and Kosovo are all, to varying degrees, democratic success stories; Somalia and Haiti are probably safely considered failures. (Let's be generous and say the jury is still out on Afghanistan.) Still, the more relevant point is that the key difference between the democratic haves and have-nots is not the conditions that prevailed prior to war; it's the occupiers' commitment to the democratization process once the fighting ends. In the words of a compelling new RAND Corporation study, America's Role in Nation-Building: From Germany to Iraq:\n \n 'What principally distinguishes [successes from failures] are not their levels of Western culture, economic development, or cultural homogeneity. Rather, it is the level of effort the United States and the international community have put into their democratic transformations. In Germany and Japan, for example, substantial American aid reduced social, political, and other obstacles to the reconstitution of parliamentary politics and facilitated a transition to democracy. Nation-building, as this study illustrates, is a time- and resource-consuming effort' (The New Republic, \"Illiberal Imagination.\" 8/6/03)\n\n When the US actually commits itself to the nittygritty of democratizing ONCE THE FIGHTING CEASES, we've seen some astounding success stories. Siegfriedson may knock our Balkan's interventions, but the fact remains that both Bosnia and Serbia are shaping up to be resounding successes. And the US (and the world) has yet to face any more German or Japanese hostility since we rebuilt those nations after WWII. The claim that US intervention is ontologically imperial is in the vogue right now amongst radical-liberal (and paleo-conservative) academics, but its empirically denied by the historical record.\n \n Of course, intervention has problems associated with it to, among them hegemonic backlash and overextension. I would make two responses to these claims. First of all, the pecuilar nature of US intervention, which is designed not for territorial gain but in order to build institutions so that nations are self-sustaining and not geopolitical liabilities, throws classic models of what happens to expansionist empires for a loop. If the US can show that it is making good faith efforts to better the world (Bosnia, Afghanistan), rather than acting under a barely concealed guise to further its own interests to the detriment of the world (Vietnam, the Phillipenes), we can forestall backlash. And since the purpose of US intervention is not to stay but the reverse: that we never have to go back again, overextension is solved for as well. Second, I would argue that even if the above doesn't fix the problem entirely, since BOTH sides have realist concerns and flaws, we might as well default to the side in the moral right. As I said above, if one doesn't save the drowning child that one could have saved, one is morally liable for his death. Princeton Bioethics Professor Peter Singer explains \n\"The fact that a person is physically near to us, so that we have personal contact with him, may make it more likely that we shall assist him, but this does not show that we ought to help him rather than another who happens to be further away. If we accept any principle of impartiality, universalizability, equality, or whatever, we cannot discriminate against someone merely because he is far away from us (or we are far away from him).\"\n\n So long as the US is capable of aiding those who are faced with death or oppression around the world, and we can do it without causing a net loss in terms of other entities of moral significance (which, since realism flows in both directions, is true), we are as obligated to aid the ones abroad as we are the ones at home. Singer summarizes his moral formulation as \"If it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought, morally, to do it.\"\n \n The position being taken is both morally bankrupt and, at best, realistly neutral if not harmful. And that's a shame, because the ability of the US to do good can be a powerful tool for those who believe in a better world for all.",

I still see it as a refocus of the US public at unreasonable financial and moral costs, but as I'm not the persons defining reason, I'll continue to watch the dollar disintegrate as our supposedly 'moral' responsibilities are pursued.

   "A few responses. I think the report of Human Rights Watch on humaniterean intereventions has some important things to say on this topic (full disclosure: in spite of the below quote, HRW still opposed the intervention in Iraq for reasons explored in the article. For my thoughts and counter-analysis to that, see here). They write: \n[I]t is worth noting two factors that we do not consider relevant in assessing whether an intervention can be justified as humanitarian. First, we are aware of, but reject, the argument that humanitarian intervention cannot be justified if other equally or more needy places are ignored. Iraqi repression was severe, but the case might be made that repression elsewhere was worse. For example, an estimated three million or more have lost their lives to violence, disease, and exposure in recent years during the conflict in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), yet intervention in the DRC was late and, compared to Iraq, modest. However, if the killing in Iraq warranted military intervention, it would be callous to disregard the plight of these victims simply because other victims were being neglected. In that case, intervention should be encouraged in both places, not rejected in one because it was weak or nonexistent in the other.\n \n Second, we are aware of, but reject, the argument that past U.S. complicity in Iraqi repression should preclude U.S. intervention in Iraq on humanitarian grounds. This argument is built on the U.S. government's sordid record in Iraq in the 1980s and early 1990s. When the Iraqi government was using chemical weapons against Iranian troops in the 1980s, the Reagan administration was giving it intelligence information. After the Anfal genocide against Iraqi Kurds in 1988, the Reagan and first Bush administrations gave Baghdad billions of dollars in commodity credits and import loan guarantees. The Iraqi government's ruthless suppression of the 1991 uprising was facilitated by the first Bush administration's agreement to Iraq's use of helicopters - permission made all the more callous because then-President Bush had encouraged the uprising in the first place. In each of these cases, Washington deemed it more important to defeat Iran or avoid Iranian influence in a potentially destabilized Iraq than to discourage or prevent large-scale slaughter. We condemn such calculations. However, we would not deny relief to, say, the potential victims of genocide simply because the proposed intervener had dirty hands in the past.\n\n Yes, its certainly true that in all likelihood, the repression in NK or Congo was worse than the repression in Iraq. But for a myriad of geopolitical and national-political reasons, Iraqi intervention was what was on the table, and to oppose it on the grounds that it shunted forces away from interventions that WEREN'T GOING TO HAPPEN REGARDLESS is foolish and counter-intuitive. This is a seperate argument, of course, for the claim that it shunted forces away from the war on terror as a whole; to that argument, I would say that only when the US proves to the Arab world that we are as concerned with improving Muslim lives as we are with ending them can we reverse the tide of ethnic hatred and resentment that fuels terrorism in that region. By working to democratize Iraq, and hopefully by extension democratize the region, we show that our interest in the Middle East extends beyond economic and security concerns, and recognizes them as \"real\" people who are also worthy of moral worth and respect as human beings.\n \n The other thing I'd like to briefly discuss is the differences between Iraq and Vietnam. There is certainly one MUCH bigger difference beyond the checking effect of China. That difference is that in Iraq, the US fought a war against tyranny in order to establish a democracy, while in Vietnam we fought a war against democracy in order to prop up a tyranny. I've written about this before, the US KNEW that national hero Ho Chi Minh would easily win any free and fair election in the country and thus refused to allow treaty-mandated elections that were slated to occur in the country. It was that action which perpetuated the division of the country into \"North\" and \"South\" and created the groundwork for war, in addition to enabling the oppressive tendancies of the southern vietnamese government. Since the US was correctly seen as a colonialist presence serving as a BARRIER to the free will of the Vietnamese people, it's no wonder that we failed to win the hearts and minds of the local populace. In Iraq, by example, our motives, if not pure, at least were not tainted by an overt opposition to Democracy, which is a key difference insofar as it makes it at least objectively possible that we could convince the Iraqi people of our benign intentions, notwithstanding the fact that Bush has messed up so badly that our window of oppurtunity might be irrevocably lost.\n \n Finally, I'm aware that our fiscal problems extend beyond foolish tax cuts. The original analysis still stands, however. Insofar as we have to set priorities in terms of where we reduce spending, it seems unfair and deeply immoral to sacrifice the most oppressed and least powerful in order to provide for the relatively wealthy and better off in the global sphere. When weighing oppurtunity costs of spending cuts, we should view it through a prism that makes sure we don't further isolate the marginalized. It seems clear to me that we can restructure our domestic spending actions such that we could still fulfill our moral obligations without facing an economic collapse, especially since the ideal end-result of these FP choices would be to further liberalize the world, which gives the US more markets to trade in and would, longterm, boost economic growth than what we have in the status quo.",

While I'm aware that our political ego continues to suffer from the Shah, as repressive a leader who has ever walked the face of this earth, being deposed by the Iranian people, the Shah, like the Sauds, was openly 'our man' while Saddam was also 'our man' in a more subtle manner.\n \n For those reasons alone, I see the invasion and occupation of Iraq as a desperate public refocus by an administration mired in domestic economic difficulties (I'm not blaming this administration for that, a circumstance building for the past 25-years) and their inability to place their hands on Bin Laden, who had successfully attacked the US in the 9/11 event. The invasion of Iraq was rationalized and initiated solely on Iraq possessing WMDs that poised a physical danger to the US, without reference to any humanitarian purposes. The humanitarian issue was raised after no justification for the WMD rational evolved and subsequently used as the primary rational for being in Iraq (instilling democracy).\n \n With regard to the financial aspects of the invasion and occupation, it served two purposes, both deceptive, equally well. Not only was Iraq shifted to a humanitarian level in the eyes of the public, making public funding of the event less of a task (even though under Geneva Agreements as the aggressor we're required to rebuild their infrastructure and provide a working government, something not publicized), a war-time footing is a wonderful method to polish GDP numbers using public debt for purposes of placating the US public for pending elections, a population now dependent on a service level economy driven by internal transactions 85% composed of public debt and siege mentality consumer spending, not industrial exports. The increase in world oil prices alone, primarily due to our ME aggression, contributed more to our internal transactions than full, service-level employment could have accomplished. \n \n In summary, humanitarian issues regarding Iraq did not surface until US claims of Iraqi possession of WMDs that endangered the US were proven unfounded. On the financial side, US military spending, at the cost of domestic spending, has greatly increased due to Iraq and ongoing domestic fears instigated by our foreign policy of approving Israel's expansionist policies. All of that increased spending is based on US public debt, primarily absorbed by China and Japan. \n \n As side notes, I found it interesting that Asian nations, led by China and Japan, declined participation in US September treasury issue auctions. Public announcements were that the US debt ceiling, currently maxed out, was being held until after the election. Waiting for the fed to raise interest rates, also after the election, would be the practical explanation. A point would just about make up the difference in the dollar's current slide against world currencies, very important to those portfolio managers. And now we've decided to furnish the entire nation of Iraq with comprehensive health care, on our nickel using public debt, also announced after the election. Are we striving to be another 1930s England?",
