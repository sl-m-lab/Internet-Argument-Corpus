   "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) &#8212; California's highest court on Monday barred doctors from invoking their religious beliefs as a reason to deny treatment to gays and lesbians, ruling that state law prohibiting sexual orientation discrimination extends to the medical profession.\n \n Justice Joyce Kennard wrote that two Christian fertility doctors who refused to artificially inseminate a lesbian have neither a free speech right nor a religious exemption from the state's law, which \"imposes on business establishments certain antidiscrimination obligations.\"\n \n In the lawsuit that led to the ruling, Guadalupe Benitez, 36, of Oceanside said that the doctors treated her with fertility drugs and instructed her how to inseminate herself at home but told her their beliefs prevented them from inseminating her. One of the doctors referred her to another fertility specialist without moral objections, and Benitez has since given birth to three children.\n \n Nevertheless, Benitez in 2001 sued the Vista-based North Coast Women's Care Medical Group. She and her lawyers successfully argued that a state law prohibiting businesses from discriminating based on sexual orientation applies to doctors.\n \n The law was originally designed to prevent hotels, restaurants and other public services from refusing to serve patrons because of their race. The Legislature has since expanded it to cover characteristics such as age and sexual orientation.http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gFyZOb5FfQtyvQ6N-Ypy1xR6pTZwD92KTJQG1\n \n 1) Just out of curiousity...\n When a person argues that they should be able to DISCRIMINATE against gays based on their religious beliefs...\n ... does anybody argue THEN that religion is the source of their prejudice??\n :xbanghead \n \n 2) If a person reviews the circumstances of the case, the doctors acted in violation of \"good faith\" in taking the money from the lesbians and wasting their time.\n \n 3) I don't see why religion should get \"special rights\" to discriminate when the rest of us can't for \"non-religious\" reasons.\n The courts got it right.",

Discrimination for religious grounds (no doubt what you have in mind with the phrase \"abstract beliefs\") shouldn't be any less acceptable than other cases in society (ones you'd no doubt label irrelevant) just because it's religion that's behind it. Particularly since you seem to want to discuss ones opinions on what's \"right\" here rather than the law--what one considers \"right\" is already a question of opinion rather than fact anyhow. It's rather arbitrary that we discriminate between men and women in terms of restrooms, for example. 'Modesty' is a rather abstract idea, after all, so even though we shouldn't have that condition on this discussion I've honored it simply because it was rather easy to do. Restrooms are going to already have stalls in them, making the discrimination all the more senseless in terms of being rational.

I don't know if it is a private clinic or not, so I would have no proof one way or the other.\n\n I can't help but chuckle at your statement here, when comparing it to how you're about to answer my question...\n Your answer to my question would seem to contend that if the clinic wishes to discriminate, that makes them \"private\", and thus they are allowed to.\n Such an approach would invalidate any discrimination law, cause the law would be moot for any agency which does NOT wishes to discriminate (ergo \"public\"), and inapplicable for those agencies which DO wish to discriminate (ergo \"private\" and exempt)...\n \n \n \nPlease explain what makes a fertility clinic \"open to the public\" vs \"not open to the public\"...\n\n \nIn my experience, a private clinic (whether they offer fertility treatments or not) can, if they wish, offer services only to those who are patients that they have already accepted. That is: they don't accept walk-in patients, only appointments. Not open to the public.\n\n Either one of two things is happening here.\n 1) You have created a self-justifying circular argument, whereby an agency CAN DEFINE FOR THEMSELVES whether they are \"public\" or \"private\" based on whether or not they \"wish\" to discriminate...\n 2) You haven't answered the question.\n You have explained an ATTRIBUTE of \"open to the public\" or \"not open to the public\", but not explained WHAT MAKES a fertility clinic one or the other.\n \n For example, it would be like explaining \"a dog has fur, while a walrus does not\".\n But that does not explain WHAT MAKES an animal a \"dog\" as opposed to a \"walrus\".\n \n \n \nOn a more personal note: You are a very unpleasant person to have a discussion with. I truly am trying to have a civilized discussion but you seem to dislike that.\n\n I would love for you to expound on why you claim I am \"unpleasant\".\n I suspect the true reasoning for such an assessment is that you don't like how I expose your arguments...\n You shouldn't confuse arguing a point successfully with personal emotion.\n \n At the same time, I would ask that you refrain from such ad hominem in the future...\n By doing so, you are creating an \"unpleasant\" atmosphere...",
