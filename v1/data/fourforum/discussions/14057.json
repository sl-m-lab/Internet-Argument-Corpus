   "Chicago is a bust!\n \n 03-26-2010, 05:49 AM \n Doc Jones \n Registered User Join Date: May 2009\n Posts: 1,376 \n \n Quote:\n Originally Posted by Galileo \n Why do people on the pro-gun side continuously try to oversimplify the issue? No one is really arguing that there would be zero murder without guns. The question is would there be less murders without guns. In developed nations with stricter gun laws there are less murders. At any rate, I don't think you can draw such conclusions based on one incident. \n \n A slimey claim you cannot support as usual. In developed Nations, the U.S. is far down the list as has been posted on this very board at least 5 times. Those 'other' Nations also have far more crime and violent crime than the U.S.\n \n \n Quote:\n In developed nations with stricter gun laws there are less murders. \n \n Compared to what? The U.S.? That would be laughable if it wasn't so serious, it is plain ridiculous. The CDC and NAS studies Tither has posted so many times still hasn't sunk it has it? There is no benefit to any gun control law that has been studied! Now here you are ignoring and contradicting scientific facts...again. Take Chicago, they have strict gun laws and have over 3 times the national rate of murders. \n \n Would you consider Chicago meets all the specs you mouthed?\n \n \n Quote:\n I don't think you can draw such conclusions based on one incident \n \n You sure can. A mass murder of at least 13 children was committed with a knife. That has happened before even in Japan as well as other countries including here. No conclusion to be drawn. It happened, it is history and now a well known fact. It is also a fact that Chicago has draconian gun laws and over 3 times the amount of murders as the United States average.\n \n Despite all your hoplophobia, governments have killed more people, their own people in the last century than all wars combined. That is an indisputable fact!\n \n Note: bold added to previous post on previous page completely ignored by star gazer.",

   " Adding guns to crime is like adding gasoline to a fire- it makes an already existing problem worse. If you think that just as many people die from stabbing and beatings in other developed nations as people die from guns in the US then you need to do more research.\n\n \n Guns in our society increased. \n   Total NICS Firearm Background Checks -- November 30, 1998 - February 28, 2010 \n\n Total Background checks = 111,582,241 \n Checks for multiple guns = 1,621,282\n\n   Total of denials = 761,814  \n \n Violent Crime and Murder rate decreased.\n   Crime in the United States -- by Volume and Rate per 100,000 Inhabitants, 1989&#8211;2008\n\n 1989 Violent crime = 666.9 murder rate= 8.7\n 1991 Violent crime = 758.2 murder rate= 9.8\n 1995 Violent crime = 684.5 murder rate= 8.2\n 2000 Violent crime = 506.5 murder rate= 5.5\n 2005 Violent crime = 469.0 murder rate= 5.6\n 2008 Violent crime = 454.5 murder rate= 5.4\n\n Add these preliminary figures.

Not gun control!\n \n Our murder rate is largely an Inner City drug and drug gang related problem. Fix that and then you will finally be doing something!",
