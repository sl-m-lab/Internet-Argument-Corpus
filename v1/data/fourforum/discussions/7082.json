   "After posting so many times about the herring gull/lesser black-backed gull ring species, last week I actually saw an American herring gull. I knew it immediately. I was on the Maine coast and they were all over the place. I lived in New England about 25 years ago, and saw herring gulls almost every day, but I wasn't aware of what a great example of speciation they are. Down here in Texas I've never seen a herring gull, although they are found along the coast, according to my field guide. But laughing gulls are common.",

   "Uhhh, congratulations.\nThanks. But it seems that you don't understand. Perhaps the people of Austin are more intelligent than they are down here in Houston. Maybe it's just that you are surrounded by educated people who show a tendency away from creationism. But you see, I run into people all the time (and meet them on this board too) who think that speciation has never been observed. Why do they think that? Because their holy book tells them so. The herring gull/lesser black-backed gull is an example of a single, vast, globe encircling population that has become separate species at the extremes of it's range - and those extremes overlap. Before I came to Texas the idea that the Book of Genesis was literally true never occurred to me. So it was kind of a neat moment to realize that the big birds around the restaurant dumpster were herring gulls, a living example of a population in the process of forming separate species.",

   "So as soon as I say that I have never seen a herring gull in Texas, they make a liar out of me. I met my wife for lunch yesterday and while returning to my car saw 6 or 7 large birds circling aroung the parking lot of a shopping center. I drove over for a closer look and one of the birds landed and just stood there about 20 feet away. Big bird! Pink legs and bill spot so it wasn't a ring-billed gull but a herring gull. Both species winter along the Texas coast.",
