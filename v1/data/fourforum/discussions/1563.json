The 1st Admendment states that congress shall make no law.. abridging freedom of speech. There is a right to speak your mind but no right to be heard and corporations cannot be prosecuted simply because they have restrictions on speech. I don't believe as some might for example that ESPN would have been in violation of Rush Limbaugh's right to speak if he had in fact been fired for his Donovan McNabb's comments. The Howard Stern indecency flap was somewhat misreported in that Clear Channel was treated as if they had violated a constitutional right and Disney is targeted for condemnation for refusing to distribute \"Farenheit 9/11\" by Michael Moore but again this is their perfect right. And we all know about the yelling fire in a crowded theatre example of how there are obvious exceptions to the rule. So yeah, I guess there is no absolute right of speech no matter what.",
