   "I don't mean to point any fingers but...IT WAS THE PROVO'S!!! \n \n \nGarda\u00ed are searching for a gang of armed and masked men who kidnapped a Dublin family, held them overnight and robbed more than \u00802 million from a security van.\n \n Reacting to the robbery, the Taoiseach said that while he had no evidence, he believed the robbery could only have been carried out by one of a small number of criminal gangs or by a paramilitary group.\n \n The men broke into the home of a family in Raheny in Dublin at around 10pm last night and held the two adults and two boys aged 13 and 17 hostage. \n \n During the night the mother and two children were driven to Cloon Wood, between Stepaside and Enniskerry, and tied up. They were held there while the father was forced to go to work as normal driving a security van.\n \n The van was intercepted by members of the gang at the Strawberry Beds near the Phoenix Park in Dublin this morning. \n \n Over \u00802million was taken from the van and the driver was also taken by the gang to Kinnegad in Co Westmeath where he was later released. \n \n \n http://www.rte.ie/news/2005/0314/kidnapping.html",
