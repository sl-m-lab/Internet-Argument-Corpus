Some say that our sense of right and wrong is just a biological instinct. Others say that it's something that society teaches us. If society teaches you that human sacrifice is okay, for example, then it's okay to do it. The Aztecs practiced human sacrifice. That means there's no objective standard for right and wrong.

   "What we all are dealing with here is the eternal conflict of faith and the scientific method. Mankind is both a spiritual and a physical creature. Does God exsist? Has been a question that has haunted us as a people for as long as there have been any concept of the Diety or Divine. We thrust for knowledge and understanding, in that search we have a need to \"see\" for ourself all that is or could be. \n \n Its this authors personal opinion after studying religious philosophies around the world and spiritualism, magic, and the concepts of that which falls into that \"fourth dimension\" of the spirit realm. What is God? Why do we need this spiritual Deity to hold on to? It is a manifestation of the need of man, to not be alone in the universe. If God exsists then we are not alone in this universe. As we learn more of the universe around us, we become more and more needy for the reassurance that we are not alone. We are a social creature, we crave and need community. Immagining that we are the only living creatures in the universe is utterly terrifying to us. What do we do? We create for ourselves a Deity to watch over us and protect us from the diabolical forces of the universe, for as we all know that what mankind can not know or understand it villianizes it to protect itself from the unknown. \n \n Now we have the Supreme Being to protect us from this unknown. From being alone in the universe. We have made him both unprovable and undisputable. When we remove all the belief around \"His\" exsistance and apply the method that has made all our current advancements reality, the scientific method, God can therefore not possibly exist, but then belief, need and faith step in. Over ruling the very method that has given us, medicines, spaceflight, energy, the one thing that seporates us from the Dark Ages, Electricity. Now we sweep all that aside and declare with one voice that God exsists because and leave it at that. Why? because we need to believe He is there, because we need to believe we are not alone.",
