   "Experts are raising the alarm because of US external debt growing. And the main reason of it concludes in hasty and aggressive politic, The Wall Street Journal supposes. Look, during last ten years Americans borrowed trillion dollars abroad for construction, wars realizing and lives needs. In case of this situation evolution Americans will lose their solvency.\n IMO only USA will get the chance to go out from inevitable economical crisis as a result of stoppage all unlashed by USA local conflicts and wars in the world. It's clear that USA is sponsors and organizers of all last decade wars. In addition to it money directed for democracy norms spreading on the post Soviet area but money vanishing as water in the sand. US officials don't understand that corruption in some countries like as Georgia and Ukraine reached beyond the clouds. And as a result of it US money is spending for nothing! \n No doubts that returning to claim life and existence by real income could help USA to come to former stability level. If not aged Americans risk to stay without or with reduced pensions, which is a probability as experts warn.",
