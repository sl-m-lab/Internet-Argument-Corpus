   "IMHO, although homophobia is the easy answer, much of the \"homophobia\" is rooted in ignorance of the subject and general paranoia. (Then there's religion of course.)\n \n Examples of this are abundant in this forum.\n \n Waxy\n\n There are several components that scientists see in the lives of people who report a homosexual orientation. (I am trying to show that this is not \"general paranoia or homophobia.)\n \n First is the family dynamic. With many homosexual men, there is a mother-father-son relationship that happens so often it has become a stereotype: the domineering mother, the passive, detached father, and a strong bond between mother and son. In both homosexual men and lesbians, it is not unusual to see a pattern where the parents don't support and cherish the gender of their children. \n \n Another component is personality, and the perception of what goes on in the family and in life. Which is why you can have two or more siblings growing up in the same family, and one becomes homosexual and the others don't. They experience the same family, but they have differing perceptions of that family. \n \n And, tragically, there is often sexual abuse. About half of homosexual men and 80-85% of lesbian women report having been abused. When boys are given the attention and affection they need but it comes in a sexual way (which constitutes abuse), they can equate getting their God-given emotional needs met, with sex. When girls are abused, it's usually by males, and it's certainly understandable why they would despise their femininity, which makes them vulnerable to sexual abuse, and shut themselves off from men because men=abusers. \n \n Many homosexual men and lesbian women report that they always experienced same-gender attraction, thus they were born gay, but since children were not created to be sexual creatures until later in life, I think it is fair to say this is an inaccurate analysis of their experience. Many of them felt different from the very beginning, not bonding to their same gender, feeling like they were outsiders, but that doesn't make them gay. It's our culture that has identified that as gay. \n \n SGA (same-gender attraction) is the symptom of emotional deficit, and it is part of living in a fallen world.",

Is there any legal precedent for passing out extra civil rights to anyone, because of their sexual orientation? Homos can enter into legally binding contracts, buy and sell property, eat at fast food restaurants . . . and they have all the rights of everyone else. They can even get married and have kids and grandchildren like everyone else, so long as they marry a person of the opposite sex. But, that rule applies to everyone; hetero's and homo's alike. \n \n It is funny that you point the finger at normal people for not handing out extra rights to a particular group in our society simply because they practice deviant sexual behavior. Then, you seek to attach this \"Homophobia\" tag on us, as if we are the ones doing something wrong. Homophobia . . . indeed. The only thing standing in the way of 'More Rights for Homo's' is common sense. \n \n A world with values based on male/female marriages can potentially sustain itself forever. A world with values based on same sex marriages cannot. That is Biology 101 and the facts of life; the birds and the bees . . . \n \n BTW, it takes a lot of heart and courage to get married, and accept the challenges, and responsibilities of raising a family in the world today. It is certainly easy to understand why many among us are heterophobic. Even so, I could not imagine being reduced to pan handling to homos for extra rights. \n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

   "Terral says:\n \nIt is funny that you point the finger at normal people for not handing out extra rights to a particular group in our society simply because they practice deviant sexual behavior. Then, you seek to attach this \"Homophobia\" tag on us, as if we are the ones doing something wrong. Homophobia . . . indeed. The only thing standing in the way of 'More Rights for Homo's' is common sense. \n \n\n \n \n The reason gays and lesbians are seeking \"Civil Rights\" is that we wish to be included into the Civil Rights Laws passed in 1964 where as indiviuals cannot be discriminated against based on race, creed, sex, RELIGION. The reason the civil rights movement existed then and still exists today is because gays are being fired from jobs, denied housing, and other basic rights. We also seek equal protection under the law for our relationships. We do not care for your approval, only the protections and priviledges offered to heterosexuals relationships REGARDLESS if those relationships have or don't have children involved. These are not extra, or special rights, these are human rights.\n \n \n Terral also says:\n \nA world with values based on male/female marriages can potentially sustain itself forever.\n\n \n If your value system is based on realtionships and marriage as opposed to the rest of the world's values which are based either on religion or science. I might suggest your are co-dependent and need to seek mental health counseling.\n \n \n Terral again:\n \nBTW, it takes a lot of heart and courage to get married, and accept the challenges, and responsibilities of raising a family in the world today.\n\n \n I couldn't agree more, but are you suggesting that gays and lesbians don't have the courage or the children? We have both. Many gays and lesbians are raising children. Either from previous heterosexual relationships or adoptions. Those children deserve for their families..protection. When a little kid is asked to draw his family and he draws his two moms or two dads. He doesn't have any understanding of the bable you spew. He knows that is his family and he loves his family. I myself am thinking baout adopting, why? Because a lot of kids need loving parents to support and nurture them. I can do that and so can my partner of 5 years. So why shouldn't we. A kid with no family, living in foster care and a different home each week would love to have a real home. I doubt the kid cares if it's two dads, two dads is better than none.",
