   "Bush defended America and western civilization in the wake of 9/11? How exactly?\n By invading a country that had nothing to do with 9/11? \n By not putting any real effort into capturing Bin Laden? \n By increasing tensions with Iran, Syria, Saudi Arabia etc.?\n By killing thousands of Iraqis and as a result creating more terrorists than the world has ever seen before?\n \n GW Bush has done absolutely nothing to make any of us safer.\n All he has done is enrich himself and his cronies and launched a disastrous new Crusade in the Middle East in a misguided attempt to strengthen America's position in the worlds most important strategic region.\n \n I can't really blame him though. Afterall, the American people have made it so easy for Presidents to get away with absolutely anything that there's no good reason not to act that way. I mean, Nixon got pardoned, Clinton got away with lying on national television etc.\n If I were the President I would probably act the same way since the President is in no way accountable for anything.",

He will have to choose to either accept the money, and the conditions that come with it, or he can keep doing the veto dance and not get his money. This is FAR from the first time congress has played this game with a president. \n \n Personally, I think that if they send it back unmodified, he will have to take it.

The rest of us do not matter. They also have three options 1 try and over ride his veto. 2 Impeachment, for crimes, such as the illegal wiretapping he has alleady admmited too. 3 take the case to the american people and put pressure on the repubinazis in the senate that are up for election in nov2008.",
