   "Saw this story in the news while on my trip to DC, and jst got the chance to post it here.\n \n http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070621/ap_on_re_us/bus_kiss_apology\n \n Here are some snippets: \nThe girls, both 14, said the driver called them \"sickos\" after a female passenger complained about their kiss. The driver then stopped the bus along the street and forced them off.\n \n\n \n\"Removing the girls from the bus was not consistent with our policy,\" said TriMet General Manager Fred Hansen. \"I want to reiterate that we welcome all riders on our system.\"\n \n The 64-year-old driver also violated company policy that requires operators to call for assistance before removing any minors, TriMet said in a statement.\n \n\n \n \nThe driver, an 11-veteran who was not identified, will be disciplined, TriMet officials said, though no details were released.\n\n \n The officials apologised for what happened, but I agree with the later statements of the article - this man should not just get a slap on the wrist. I don't think he should be \"disiplined\" - he should be fired: not just for either his personal bigotry (which he may or may not have), or bowing to the bigotry of the woman who complained, but also for both BREAKING POLICY, and leaving these two kids out where anything could have happened to them - ENDANGERING MINORS.",

   "I can just see the replies now...\n \n 1) NOBODY should be allowed to kiss on the bus.\n 2) MINORS should not be allowed to kiss on the bus. The bus driver should act as a de facto parent, cause obviously bus drivers are trained and qualified to act as such while driving the bus...\n 3) Neither gays nor straights should be allowed to ride the bus!\n \n \n And of course, not one mention of the prejudice which is at the heart of this incident. Not one mention of how prejudice has once again reared its ugly head and reacted callously and without regard to the potential danger of the situation. Not one mention as to how the EXISTING rules were violated, and the driver was improper to create his own improptu rules...\n \n Please. Prove me wrong.\n I could use some optimism! emoticon_rolleyes",

   "I live in Portland, OR and I ride the transit system here. We're known for having an excellent and growing public transportation system here in Portland but there are always bad eggs. As I'm sure other transit riders know, sometimes you just get an ####### for a bus driver. \n \n I'm shocked at the obvious prejudice of the female rider who complained, I can only picture a tight-lipped, tight-assed sour-face old bitch. I'm wondering what the goal of this prude was...to actually get them kicked off for offending her morals? I'm surprised no other rider stood up for these girls and demanded the bus driver to continue on. I would have been livid.\n \n I see all sorts of crazy stuff riding public transportation and most people don't care. There is a young couple that frequents my bus (who are somewhat mentally challenged) that constantly grope and make out with each other. Of course some people stare with sickened looks on their faces, but nobody complains. \n \n Don't ride a public bus if you can't stand to be around the public!!!",
