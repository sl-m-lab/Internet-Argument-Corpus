   "The greek origin of the word \"globus\" refers to a sphere.\n \"Locus\" was the greek geometric term for \"place\" which then became the Latin word for \"place\" in general.\n \n These are where we get our words \"global\" and \"local.\" We extended the meaning to include near or specific (local) and encompassing and general (global).\n \n We then extended \"global\" which meant spherical to mean \"around the world\" since we discovered that the earth was a sphere, even though it should mean \"spherical\" \n \n In common usage this meaning dominates. I can see why it's so hard for most of you to see how the word could be used in a different way.\n \n There just happens to be another meaning of the word besides \"spherical\" or \"around the world\", which is \"comprehensive, total, general.\" This meaning is equally valid in the context that was used, despite the next sentence which used the word \"world\" (which also has various meanings and applications). \n \n So I exaggerated with the bank account statement. Sue me. But, I never lost any bet. When Kerry comes out and says \"I meant 'around the world' instead of 'general'\" then I lost the bet. Anyone that wants a check needs to send me their address. I'll be sure you get something in the mail.\n \n The fact that someone didn't know that \"global\" could have a different meaning and starting a whole thread about it is amusing to me, if you want to know the truth. emoticon_rolleyes",
