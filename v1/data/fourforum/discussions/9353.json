I don't see a reason why eve couldn't come first though.\n \n \n EVE'S TALK WITH GOD\n \"Lord, I have a problem.\" God asks, \"What's the problem, Eve?\" \"I know that you created me and provided this beautiful garden and all of these wonderful animals, as well as that hilarious comedic snake, but I'm just not happy.\" God replies, \"And why is that Eve?\" \"Lord, I am lonely, and I'm sick to death of apples.\" \"Well, Eve, in that case, I have a solution. I shall create a man for you\" \"Man? What is that Lord?\" \"Man is a flawed creature with many bad traits. He'll lie, cheat and be vain; all in all, he'll give you a hard time. But he'll be bigger, faster and will like to hunt and kill things. I'll create him in such a way that he will satisfy your physical needs. He will be witless and will revel in childish things like fighting and kicking a ball about. He won't be as smart as you, so he will also need your advice to think properly.\" \"Sounds great,\" says Eve, with ironically raised eyebrows, \"but what's the catch Lord?\" \"Well\" says God... \"you can have him on one condition.\" \"And what's that Lord?\" \"As I said, he'll be proud, arrogant and self absorbed, so you'll have to let him believe that I made him first. And it will have to be our little secret......... you know, woman to woman.\" \n ",

The confusion's simply because of different areas we live in. I live way up in the north of Scotland and the cost of living here is way lower than, say, London. You can buy a large 3 bedroomed house up here for the price of a one bedroomed flat in london. I don't know where you live, but your wages are obviously higher than here. I remember my parents saying that when they went to New York on holiday the locals thought they were poor when they told them thier salary LOL.\n \n In your area the wages of say a Nursary Nurse will be higher than \u00a312/hour to make up for local area inflation.",
