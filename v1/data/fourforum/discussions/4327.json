   "I'm a big fan of Inside the Actor's Studio and always look forward to the Bernard Pivot questionnaire at the end. Here it is with my responses. How would all of you respond?\n \n 01. What is your favorite word?\n Joy...or sugar\n \n 02. What is your least favorite word?\n Literally. Because of it's complete misuse. People use to emphasize the importance of something, but when they don't actually mean literally. It drives me absolutely nuts.\n \n 03. What turns you on creatively, spiritually or emotionally?\n Passion\n \n 04. What turns you off?\n Falseness, including, but not limited to, manipulation, slander, arrogance, lies, and pretentiousness.\n \n 05. What is your favorite curse word?\n I don't curse that much, usually just use faux-curse words like crud, fudgemuffins, holy moley, etc. But if I had to say an accepted curse word, I'd have to say horse****. It just sounds good.\n \n 06. What sound or noise do you love?\n Laughter, especailly my grandmother's.\n \n 07. What sound or noise do you hate?\n Fingernails on the blackboard is obvious, so I'd have to say I especially hate the sound of a DJ talking over the end of a song. As I said, I don't cuss often, but that is one of those things that makes me cuss out the DJ in my car.\n \n 08. What profession other than your own would you like to attempt?\n If I had the skill, ether writing (novels, short stories), directing films or being a chef (I watch the Food Network constantly)\n \n 09. What profession would you not like to attempt?\n When Martin Sheen was on Inside the Actor's Studio he said executioner and I can't beat that.\n \n 10. If Heaven exists, what would you like to hear God say when you arrive at the Pearly Gates?\n Welcome home.\n \n All right, let's here 'em guys.",

I thought about teaching a class on broadcasting (similar to a course I took my senior year called Radio And TV Production.) I also did some contemplating on teaching a drama type course but knowing my luck (or the simple fact that I'm a guy) it would be expected for me to teach the Stage Craft class. Let's just say I was never any good with wood...At All. That would be like the blind leading the blind.
