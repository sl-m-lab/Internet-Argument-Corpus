   "GRINGO", 
   "Before the recent election for mayor of Los Angeles, candidate Antonio Villaraigosa attended a press conference in Pacific Palisades on May 11. There, an alumnus of UCLA held up a poster and asked him to renounce the radical separatist group MEChA (The Chicano Student Movement of Aztlan). After dancing around the question for years, Villaraigosa said, \"I am not in agreement with most of its precepts. But in the university, we were all part of that organization. Of course I renounce its philosophy.\" (RedState.Org.)\n \n Villaraigosa, now the mayor of L.A., was a former official of MEChA. He and all members of MEChA accept The Plan of Aztlan as their guide to the goal of Reconquista, the recapture of a good part of the American Southwest, which was ceded to the United States from Mexico in 1848 after its defeat in the Mexican-American War. This plan includes driving the gringos (white Americans) from the region. Can you say ethnic cleansing?\n \n Before his sudden conversion, the mayor had consistently refused to repudiate MEChA and continues to associate with other members. In a story in the San Diego Union-Tribune, February 13,1999 (which is no longer \"available\" on their website), Villaraigosa said of his involvement with MEChA, \"I'm proud of it.\" In a 1995 conference at UC Riverside, he mentioned his time spent with MEChA and stated,... that's where the young people are going to get started (indoctrinated) here.\"\n \n Illegal immigration is the key ingredient in the reconquest of the Southwestern U.S. It is also the reason why Villaraigosa had the votes to become mayor. Every Chicano in California knows that. \n \n On July 4, 1996, at an Independence Day rally and celebration at the federal building in Westwood, illegal aliens and the Communist Progressive Labor Party had a violent confrontation with Americans. Some of the comments make it clear where Chicanos stand-then and now.\n \n Female: \"Go back to Simi Valley, you skunks. Go back to woodland Hills. Go back to Boston. Go back to the Plymouth Rock, you pilgrims. Get out. We are the future. Go on. We have beaten you. Leave like beaten rats.\"\n \n Augustine Cebada, information Minister of the Brown Berets, the foot soldiers of the Aztlan movement: 'We are the majority here and we are not going to be pushed around. We are here in Westwood. This is the fourth time we've been here in the last two months, to show white Anglo-Saxon Protestant L.A., the few of you who remain, that we are the majority and we claim this land as ours. It has always been ours and we're still here.And this talk about deporting. If anybody's gonna be deported, it's gonna be you.\"\n \n These are the fine upstanding citizens of L.A. who made Villaraigosa the mayor. He needs all the illegals he can get to further his personal goals as well as those of MEChA. That is why he is in lockstep with Mexican president Vicente Fox. Villaraigosa, like Fox, wants open borders and all the benefits for illegal aliens. Barbara Coe, a sponsor for Proposition 187 (denies public benefits to illegals) said that: \"Villaraigosa is a militant for illegal aliens.\" \n \n The mayor is a divider, not a uniter.His goal, like his MEChA buddies, is to bring in as many immigrants as possible to inundate the Southwest, make them legal with the help of George Bush, and eventually control all public offices (city, county, state, and federal). You would then have a region filled with voters having dual citizenship and loyalty to Mexico. Their influence on U.S. foreign policy, especially toward Mexico, would be enormous. The Mexican/American voters, with their large block of electoral votes, would also decide who becomes president. \n \n Then there is the question of the future of America. In a January 4, 2002 article by Art moore in WorldNetDaily, Glenn Spencer, president of Voices of Citizens Together, said, \"Unless this (illegal immigration) is shut down within two years, I believe that it will be irreversible, and that it will most certainly lead to a breakup of the United States.\" A large contingent of Chicanos would agree since they've been proclaiming this as inevitable for a number of years. The election of Villaraigosa as mayor of Los Angeles is proof of the rapid progress the movement has made.\n \n Without the help of politicians from both parties (hispanic and white) and the chilling silence from the news media, this unprecedented event in our nation's history would not be possible. It is a scenario right out of The Twilight Zone.\n \n \"A nation can survive its fools and even the ambitious. But it cannot survive treason from within. An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and he carries his banners openly against the city. But the traitor moves among those gates freely, his sly whispers rustling through all alleys, heard in the very halls of government itself.... He rots the soul of a nation; he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of a city; he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to be feared. The traitor is the plague.\"\n \n Cicero\n \n \"There is no room in this country for hyphenated Americans...The one absolutely certain way of bringing this nation to ruin, of preventing all possibility of it continuing to be a nation at all, would be to permit it to become a tangle of squabbling nationalities.\" \n \n Teddy Roosevelt\n \n Diversity is divisive.\n \n Gringo",
