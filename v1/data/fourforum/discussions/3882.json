Based on what we can observe it does not seem that the genesis is accurate and the idea that we gradually evolved is supported but not proved by the fossil record but I see no evidence whatsoever for genesis. Finally creationists do mention that the universe may appear to older than it is and since it is obvious science goes on appearances they should have no problem whatsoever.",

Some people perceive that they have too much to lose by believing anything other than that which they already believe. This is a debate that I believe will continue as long as there exist minds to conceive the concept of their own origins.\n \n \nI would like to see on what key factors you... base your argument. \n \n My 'argument' is based upon one thing.

   "All right Black Phoenix, I'll take you at your word. We are talking about the biological theory of evolution. Here are some of the key points that suport evolution.\n 1) The fossil record is found in a strict order, an order that can only be explained by the theory of evolution. Unambiguous transitional fossils have been found and again, they can only be explained by the theory of evolution. While it's true that most organisms do NOT become fossilized, those we have found overwhelmingly support evolution.\n \n 2) Organisms are grouped together in nested hierarchies, groups within groups, based on morphological similarities. The only explaination that matches the nested hierarchies we see in nature is the theory of evolution.\n Please note that nested hierarchies based on morphological similarities are also observed in the fossil record, two lines of evidence converge to support evolution.\n \n 3)Genetics gives us much evidence to support the theory of evolution. We can group related organisms together by similarities in their genetic structure. And these groupings match, almost exactly, the groupings of organisms we devise based on morphological similarities. Two distinct disciplines converge to support evolution and no other explaination.\n We also see how mutation works, how it can increase the size of a genome and how it can add new functions and structures. We see endogenous retro viruses that leave markers in an organism's genetic structure. Some of these markers are passed by heredity. Organisms that share these markers can only have aquired them from a common ancestor, for example, chimpanzees and humans share 7 endogenous retroviruses, the only way for this to happen is if chimps and humans share a common ancestor. Evolution is the only explaination for this.\n \n These are three of the strongest reasons to accept evolution, let's discuss them in detail.......",

Alright....so lets get it on.....\n\n \n Since you're admittedly too lazy, and wish us instead to re-write what we've written (which is OK, why else would be be on a debate forum? :) )\n \n \n Typical christian brainwash rhetoric:\n \n 1. god exists and is unknowable\n - A logical contradiction\n \n 2. You know god exists based on faith\n - Irrational, faith cannot seperate truth from falsity\n \n We cannot discuss divine creation until the premise is sound.\n \n - Motives:\n Christianity has been around a long time as a political and social power base. It's a big business, whose modus operendi is brainwashing. It has evolved to suit the needs of the chruch, and the desires of the people. It's a business of selling non-existence (souls), and the indefensible (morals).\n \n - Why is evolution the only scientific theory you object to? Because it contradicts your human-written bible. Interestingly enough, all scientific theories are based on observable evidence, and if you object to one, you must reasonably object to them all. Next time you say you believe in god and not science, I suggest you pray for a cure to your mother's illness rather than take her to see a medical scientist (a doctor). Or, admit that science works, and faith is a personal creed that does NOT describe what happens, or happened in reality.\n \n Where did you learn about god? From other humans, or from evidence?\n \n Where does the theory of evolution come from? Evidence, not other humans, and it's been tested time and time again through observable evidence corresponding with the theory. No evidence shows it to be false.\n \n Your faith is your own. Your beliefs are your own. America defends your freedom to believe what you want, how you want. But when you try to tear down the works of millions of dead and dying humans, the knowledge of our world - science, with rhetoric, it's disappointing. Has our civilization not yet realized what's important in this short life we have? Apparently not.\n \n That's a good start.\n \n -Mach",

In my opinion, there is faith and the lack of it, period.\n \n Believing in creation, to me, still does not rule out many aspects of science, just as believing in science does not rule out creation.\n \n Hard-core advocates will always be at odds on this one.",

I am referring to the general theory of evolution, correct me if I'm wrong, which believes these five major events took place without God:...\nIt's useful that you have explained this. Scientists refer only to the evolution of life when refering to \"the theory of evolution\". The \"general theory of evolution\" is an invention of YEC supporters and has no scientific basis. It would be useful therefore if you left that nonsense at the door and only discussed biological evolution under the heading of \"evolution\". If you want to discuss cosmology, genesis of life, or whether a god was involved in any of these and/ or whether god used evolution to create today's lifeforms then of course do so. Just don't call it evolution please.\n \n \nNow here are the six main areas of evolution that we will be able to discuss:\n \n 1. Cosmic evolution-the origin of time, space, and matter.

Please make sure you tell us which type of evolution you are refeing to therefore to avoid confusion.\n \n \n4. Organic evolution-Origin of life from inanimate matter.\nThis isn't evolution; this is genesis. Of course we can discuss whether it was a god-created genesis or a purely naturalistic event, but that would be a largely pointless discussion as we do not and (currently) cannot know.\n \n \n5. Macroevolution-Changing from one kind into another.\nAh finally real biological evolution covered by the theory of evolution. This may be discussed as \"evolutio\" without the need to qualify the type of evolution as we will undertstand what you mean.\n \n \n6. Microevolution-Variations within kinds. Only this one has been observed.\nIt's worth you knowing that there is a growing view here that labradores and poodles for example are different kinds.

That doesn't require that you convert them in YECs, or even that they acknowledge a higher power, it simply requires that you lay out a rational and well presented argument, complete with the necessary evidence, that supports your case.\n \n You have to expect your presentation to be questioned and challenged, that's the whole point of posting on a forum like this. If you didn't want that, then this is really the wrong medium to try and express yourself. You have to be open to the questions and challenges as well, and be willing to meet them and learn from them.\n \n You may want to check out some of the numerous threads on this board regarding faith, belief, etc... I think with some increased understanding you might find that evolution is not a religion, and certainly doesn't require faith.\n \n Just get the ball rolling, believe me, people will be along to fine tune the definitions once you get started.\n \n Waxy",

The previous posters that have talked about general theories of evolution take other peoples statement out of context and twist it around so even though on the surface it seems petty to a new visitor there is a reason for people wanting to be strict.\n\n \n Hey, I saw this and thought of your comment (and the previous comments).\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophist\n \n \nReconstruction of Sophist philosophy\n In traditional logical argument, a set of premises are connected together according to the rules of logic and lead therefore to some conclusion. When someone criticizes the argument, they do so by pointing out either falsehoods among the premises or logical fallacies, flaws in the logical scaffolding. These criticisms may be subject to counter-criticisms, which in turn may be subject to counter-counter-criticisms, etc. Generally, some judge or audience eventually either concurs with or rejects the position of one side and thus a consensus opinion of the truth is arrived at.\n \n The essential insight of sophistry is that the actual logical validity of an argument is irrelevant; it is only the ruling of the audience which ultimately determine whether a conclusion is considered \"true\" or not. By appealing to the prejudices and emotions of the judges, one can garner favorable treatment for one's side of the argument and cause a factually false position to be ruled true.\n \n The philosophical Sophist goes one step beyond that and points out that since it was traditionally accepted that the position ruled valid by the judges was literally true, any position ruled true by the judges must be considered literally true, even if it was arrived at by naked pandering to the judges' prejudices - or even by bribery.\n \n Various (perhaps even most) politicians employ sophistry, as well.\n\n \n \n \n I think we can all name a few sophists :) (not necessarily related to this poster)\n \n I'm not sure if we should feel comforted, or horrified, that this sort of thing has always exists, and still flourishes today. Realistically, it's reasonable to employ sophism, which makes it all the more horrible to comprehend.\n \n -Mach",

   "Yes, evolution is a religion because it requires faith to believe in something that does not have 100% empiracle evidence that it actually occurred.\n\n \n Evolution is based on reason. Actually you can use the word \"science\" and avoid the ugly word-police from jumping you on that claim, but either way the argument AGAINST your claim is the same:\n \n Reason does NOT imply 100% certainty, actually, reason dictates it's IMPOSSIBLE to have 100% certainty with regards to observation (for instance, how can we be certain we aren't all dreaming? We cannot!).\n Faith on the other hand, claims 100% certainty, without needing justification.\n \n These two terms, REASON and FAITH, are opposites.\n Your claim \"reason(evolution) is based on faith\", doesn't make sense, and that's ultimately why I disagree.\n \n \n But don't take my word for it, you don't HAVE to take my word for it, based on faith. I give you justification, and you can also (get this!) you can see for yourself, independant of me!\n \n Reason:\n http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=reason\n \n c : a sufficient ground of explanation or of logical defense; especially : something (as a principle or law) that supports a conclusion or explains a fact\n \n Faith:\n http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=faith\n \n b (1) : firm belief in something for which there is no proof\n =================\n \n Why is faith not adequate for making claims as you did?\n \n (on the philosphy thread too).\n \n Faith is not a reliable method for seperating truth from falsity:\n - I have faith that life occured as a result of evolutionary changes\n - I have faith that life did NOT occur as a result of evolutionary changes.\n \n They can be in contradiction, yet by faith, both can be claimed as \"true\". Meaningless isn't it?\n \n Note: Neither of these claims need to be justified, since...see the defintion, we do not need PROOF to back them (by definition of faith).\n \n So, if we use faith as the \"reason\" backing any claim, essentially it's like saying nothing at all, it has no foundation from which to declare it as true, or false.\n \n This is why the claim of scientists that evolution (changes in allele frequencey) over time, resulted in the diversity of life on earth, is supported by independantly verifiable facts, and it's why no other substantial evidence contradicts this claim. Can we be certain? Of our own existence, yes, but not about observable reality. To claim we cannot claim evolution as fact, is like saying we cannot claim we are typing on a computer...both are based on similar reasoned evidence.\n \n It is, a justified truth, based on reason, not faith.\n \n -Mach",

   "I just wanted to add one more thing to clear up some stuff and make sure I have the standards set correctly before we delve into a hardcore debate of facts.\nThe standards for debate have been long established. All you have to do is use words for which the meanings are clearly understood by all. \n \n \n \n\n When I use the word evolution, I am not referring to the minor variations found in all of the various life forms (microevolution). I am referring to the general theory of evolution, correct me if I'm wrong, which believes these five major events took place without God:\nThere is generally no need to ask to be corrected if you're wrong. We are good at that.\n \n Your first statement (bold in quote) is wrong. \n \n There is no \"general\" theory of evolution. Even if there was...\n \n a theory does not believe anything.\n \n I am not aware of any denial of God inherent in the theory of evolution. The theory casts doubt on some of the \"facts\" presented in the bible, but it does not address the existense or non-existense of God. As a matter of fact, there are people who believe in evolution and God. They believe God made all this happen and that God is the Supreme Being, but that the biblical account of how it happened is imbellished for ease of understanding.\n \n \n \n\n 1. Time, space, and matter came into existence by themselves.\nThis is not so. God was, then time, then stuff. God made it all happen.\n \n \n\n 2. Planets and stars formed from space dust.\nThey did...after God blew the stuff throughout space.\n \n \n\n 3. Matter created life by itself.\nWrong! God created life (on Earth) by allowing elements to react with each other to form cells.\n \n \n \n\n 4. Early life forms learned to reproduce themselves.\nI wouldn't call it learning. Single cell lifeforms did (and still do) divide and reproduce by consuming surrounding energy. Vegetable matter uses photosynthesis to extract energy from light and produces oxygen as a byproduct. Advanced animal matter uses oxygen to oxidize ingested materials producing expendable energy in their muscles and a byproduct useful to the vegetation.\n \n \n \n\n 5. Major changes occurred between these diverse life forms (i.e., fish changed to amphibians, amphibians changed to reptiles, and reptiles changed to birds or mammals).\nImproperly stated. Changes occured among these diverse lifeforms.\n \n \n \n\n Now here are the six main areas of evolution that we will be able to discuss:\nWe will be able to discuss whatever we want. You should ask permission to limit the discussion to certain areas.\n \n \n\n 1. Cosmic evolution-the origin of time, space, and matter. Big Bang.\nThis has nothing to do with your claim that animals didn't evolve from each other. There are many existing threads and discussions already about the origin of time and space. Your initial goal was to shoot down the evolutionists with proof that God did it all in 6 days.\n \n \n \n \n\n 2. Chemical evolution-the origin of higher elements from hydrogen.\nThis is new to me.\n \n \n\n 3. Stellar and planetary evolution-Origin of stars and planets.\nThis takes the argument back too far. After all, the biblical account is that the Earth was here before the stars and the sun. It would make sense to limit the discussion to life on Earth...how did it come to be what it is today?\n \n \n\n 4. Organic evolution-Origin of life from inanimate matter.\nAre you talking of defining the timeline or the explaination of how it happened. All things physical are made of inanimate elements. When taken to the smallest denominator (the atom) there is no life. It's only when these atoms combine to make cells that combine to make other cells (to reproduce) that there is any life involved. Bacteria reproduce by consuming energy.\n \n \n \n 5. Macroevolution-Changing from one kind into another.\nYou're too kind. There are species and families, not kinds of animals.\n \n \n \n\n 6. Microevolution-Variations within kinds. Only this one has been observed.\nWrong again! \n \n Cosmic evolution has been and continues to be observed. We've learned recently of star factories, supernovas, black holes, new planets.\n \n {Your areas (1) and (3) should be combined.}\n \n The fact that we exist is evidence that we are a lifeform that developed from dead elements.\n \n \n \n \n \n\n So there are some standards I guess you could say, sorry for lack of a better word but it has been a long day and my vocabulary isn't as sharp as it use to be. Correct me if I'm misinformed or incorrect about any of my above statements concerning my understanding of evolution. Anyways I just wanted to add that real quick before I headed off to bed, and hopefully I will have those questions answered for you by tomorrow. Night.......\nYour approach to this appears to be freshman.

   "While we're waiting and since this is to be the argument ending last creation/evolution thread ever...let me post this tidbit about a reformed atheist.\n \n NEW YORK Dec 9, 2004 - A British philosophy professor who has been a leading champion of atheism for more than a half-century has changed his mind. He now believes in God more or less based on scientific evidence, and says so on a video released Thursday.\n \n At age 81, after decades of insisting belief is a mistake, Antony Flew has concluded that some sort of intelligence or first cause must have created the universe. A super-intelligence is the only good explanation for the origin of life and the complexity of nature, Flew said in a telephone interview from England.\n \n Flew said he's best labeled a deist like Thomas Jefferson, whose God was not actively involved in people's lives.\n \n \"I'm thinking of a God very different from the God of the Christian and far and away from the God of Islam, because both are depicted as omnipotent Oriental despots, cosmic Saddam Husseins,\" he said. \"It could be a person in the sense of a being that has intelligence and a purpose, I suppose.\"\n \n Flew first made his mark with the 1950 article \"Theology and Falsification,\" based on a paper for the Socratic Club, a weekly Oxford religious forum led by writer and Christian thinker C.S. Lewis.\n \n Over the years, Flew proclaimed the lack of evidence for God while teaching at Oxford, Aberdeen, Keele, and Reading universities in Britain, in visits to numerous U.S. and Canadian campuses and in books, articles, lectures and debates.\n \n There was no one moment of change but a gradual conclusion over recent months for Flew, a spry man who still does not believe in an afterlife.\n \n Yet biologists' investigation of DNA \"has shown, by the almost unbelievable complexity of the arrangements which are needed to produce (life), that intelligence must have been involved,\" Flew says in the new video, \"Has Science Discovered God?\"\n \n The video draws from a New York discussion last May organized by author Roy Abraham Varghese's Institute for Metascientific Research in Garland, Texas. Participants were Flew; Varghese; Israeli physicist Gerald Schroeder, an Orthodox Jew; and Roman Catholic philosopher John Haldane of Scotland's University of St. Andrews.\n \n The first hint of Flew's turn was a letter to the August-September issue of Britain's Philosophy Now magazine. \"It has become inordinately difficult even to begin to think about constructing a naturalistic theory of the evolution of that first reproducing organism,\" he wrote.\n \n The letter commended arguments in Schroeder's \"The Hidden Face of God\" and \"The Wonder of the World\" by Varghese, an Eastern Rite Catholic layman.\n \n This week, Flew finished writing the first formal account of his new outlook for the introduction to a new edition of his \"God and Philosophy,\" scheduled for release next year by Prometheus Press.\n \n Prometheus specializes in skeptical thought, but if his belief upsets people, well \"that's too bad,\" Flew said. \"My whole life has been guided by the principle of Plato's Socrates: Follow the evidence, wherever it leads.\"\n \n Last week, Richard Carrier, a writer and Columbia University graduate student, posted new material based on correspondence with Flew on the atheistic www.infidels.org Web page. Carrier assured atheists that Flew accepts only a \"minimal God\" and believes in no afterlife.\n \n Flew's \"name and stature are big. Whenever you hear people talk about atheists, Flew always comes up,\" Carrier said. Still, when it comes to Flew's reversal, \"apart from curiosity, I don't think it's like a big deal.\"\n \n Flew told The Associated Press his current ideas have some similarity with American \"intelligent design\" theorists, who see evidence for a guiding force in the construction of the universe. He accepts Darwinian evolution but doubts it can explain the ultimate origins of life.\n \n A Methodist minister's son, Flew became an atheist at 15.\n \n Early in his career, he argued that no conceivable events could constitute proof against God for believers, so skeptics were right to wonder whether the concept of God meant anything at all.\n \n Another landmark was his 1984 \"The Presumption of Atheism,\" playing off the presumption of innocence in criminal law. Flew said the debate over God must begin by presuming atheism, putting the burden of proof on those arguing that God exists. \n \n http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=315976",

   "Black Phoenix, if you are still here, I just want to jump in and warn you of a few things. I am new to this board, but certainly not new to this debate. \n First of all, you make a couple of mistakes early on, that experienced evo-creo debatists will not allow you to make.\n You have to understand these points if you want to make a meaningful contribution to this debate.\n First-- We have all heard the arguments you have presented before.\n Second-- While we have working theories, we do not have certain answers to the origins of the universe, or of life. This is a common creationist ploy to lump these all together, then to latch on to the unknowns as some kind of disproof of evolution. This is why evolutionists will not allow you to lump these all together. If you want to pose a serious discussion, you have to focus strictly on the issue of changes in life after its creation. This is not some kind of semantic trick, rather an attempt to keep the discussion focused on the issue at hand.\n Third--- because we have all heard your points before, many get bored answering the same questions again and again, and respond with disdain. You have to have a thick skin if you intend to stay in the discussion. I for one, enjoy explaining the theory to those who know little of it, so I have no problem repeating myself. \n You do not have to be an expert in this topic to discuss it, you only have to be someone who is interested in the topic, so don't allow people to put you down for what you don't know. Just keep an open mind and try to soak up the information that is given to you. That is what I try to do.\n Good luck, I hope you learn from this experience.",

   "Well thanks to you all for your patients. Just want to clarify that these next few posts are concerning Mach's original post and Demon38's post earlier on this thread. I tried to give answeres as concise and exact....but since this is such an enormous topic it may seem very brief. Hopefully we can go into each point that you may feel wasn't an adequate response for you. It was a lot of stuff in short period. Sorry for sounding like a smart aleck in response to Mach's I was in a bad mood when I had wrote my response to his argument. \n \n Alrighty here we go...I know most of you thought this day would never come..but here we go.....remember I tried to be nice so sorry Mach....\n \n This is in response to Mach's post at the beginning of the thread....\n \n \"....Typcial Christian brainwash rhetoric:\n \n 1. God exists and is unknowable-\n A logical contradiction....\"\n \n Well you are right God exists.....unkowable...well not exactly. We are just not capable to comprehend God to the fullest extent...but the Bible is one of the best ways to \"know\" God...and praying and so forth....this isn't a debatable topic really...\n \n \"2. You know God exists on faith-\n -Irrational, faith cannot separate truth from falsity \"\n \n Well that's a valid point from your point of view, but if you were educated in at least my denomination of faith (Assembly of God although I don't claim to be a Christian since I don't want to however I agree with the concepts and was thoroughly educated in it) you would have a better understanding of the whole faith process....but you all don't want a sermon you want science. I don't really base my belief in God in faith, I base my beliefs more on reason, logic, and events that have occurred in my life.\n \n I'm lazy....so look on the first page for the rest of the references as to what I'm referring to on this next part...\n \n Unfortunately Christianity has come to posses a very sour taste for many Americans due to the problems in the Catholic Church, and like you stated constantly being a social and political power base; Which I think is very sad....but the reflection of mans failure to accurately portray and convey what Jesus's teachings were should not hinder your faith in God. \n \n Your whole argument over all though has nothing to do with evolution....till the middle end portion.....which you assume me to not believe in medicine or science?...hmm.....I do....surprise...I go to the doctor regularly....see it is necessary for you to understand that God gave man the gift of science after we fell from Eden as a means of survival other than praying. I don't claim to understand God 100% but I think I have a pretty decent grasp on it. You have obviously been burned by professed Christians, church, or maybe God didn't answer a prayer of yours....I don't know...but I'm genuinely sorry for it. However you are simply venting your problems with religion, which I agree with you on, you aren't arguing evolution vs. creation though. Evolution came from a bored guy who didn't want to accept God as the reason for everything...which I think was good because it has promoted peoples interest in science thus allowing us to make incredible advances, unfortunately Darwin had to destroy many ignorant people's faith in God, because they really didn't know what they believed in....so they accepted the \"facts\". \n Now it is true that I learned about God, and the whole bit from my parents and church, but that doesn't mean I didn't eventually come to accept, I simply sought the answers that I needed and found them. You can't refute the Bible, almost any literature teacher or anyone will proclaim that it is one of the most sound books written regardless if they believe in it or not. \n \n Anyways I'm not going to ramble on in response to your ramble, the last point I want to address is that you believe that I \"try to tear down the works of millions of dead and dying humans, the knowledge of our world - science, with rhetoric, it's disappointing\"\n \n I was never making an argument against science, I'm making an argument against a flawed theory that desperately needs to be corrected. Anyways, I'm going to go finish up my response to Demon who actually posted some points that \"support\" evolution. I'm not arrogant, sorry if I come across this way, it simply makes me angry for people to have their faith destroyed based on one man's proposal, well actually there was a guy that was before Darwin, but I forget....it's simply been one man's proposal that was built on continuously into a hideous monster. You'll understand my views better as we go through this long nightmare of an argument. \n \n So on to Demon............",

   "Now Demon...I like you since you haven't tried to butcher me on your first chance.....so here we go....\n \n \"1) The fossil record is found in a strict order, an order that can only be explained by the theory of evolution. Unambiguous transitional fossils have been found and again, they can only be explained by the theory of evolution. While it's true that most organisms do NOT become fossilized, those we have found overwhelmingly support evolution.\"\n \n Well I don't think I'll be as big of a XXXXX to you as I was to Mach, but I have one answer for that point.........about 4400 years ago there was a flood...it covered the whole earth...and so on....but that is a huge topic that deserves another thread....and I suppose I'll answer your questions about the flood as well....you just have to remember I hate typing, writing or responding to anything for anything really, since I'm a bum. Yes, the flood would be able to explain the fossils and how they all became fossilized...of course that topic will most likely lead to dinosaurs and so on...but we'll tackle one issue one at a time.\n \n \"2) Organisms are grouped together in nested hierarchies, groups within groups, based on morphological similarities. The only explanation that matches the nested hierarchies we see in nature it the theory of evolution. Please note that nested hierarchies based on morphological similarities are also observed in the fossil record, two lines of evidence converge to support evolution.\"\n \n Ok.....just to touch briefly on the fossil record is pretty much circle reasoning.....that's for later though....and the similarities are simple to explain....\n \n Ok...now you have to let me set up a base for my point here. Now God made us in his image according to the Bible....well I believe we inherited some of his traits or characteristics...whatever you want to call it...such as the need for companionship, the need to love....and all that stuff...so let's assume we inherited some of that laziness or his complacent laid back manner.....remember he took a nap on the 7th day.....well let's just say when he was \"designing\" everything he just got lazy and made some small changes here...and when he was feeling like it he added spots here....a tail there...and you know what wa la.....tons of variety but with lots of similarities in the genetic structure and so forth because he didn't feel like getting to crazy....I don't know what God was doing...but just say he was to lazy to make us all extravagantly different. Therefore arguing similarities as a strong point of evolution doesn't really justify evolution or support it to be more correct....\n \n \"3) Genetics gives us much evidence to support the theory of evolution. We can group related organisms together by similarities in their genetic structure. And these groupings match, almost exactly, the groupings of organisms we devise based on morphological similarities. Two distinct disciplines converge to support evolution and no other explanation. We also see how mutation works, hot it can increase the size of a genome and how it can add new functions and structures. We see endogenous retro viruses that leave markers in an organism's genetic structure. Some of these markers are passed by heredity. Organisms that share these markers can only have acquired them from a common ancestor, for example, chimpanzees share 7 endogenous retroviruses, the only way for this to happen is if chimps and humans share a common ancestor. Evolution is the only explanation for this.\"\n \n Alright let's discuss this in detail...you have 3 little points compacted into one...which is fine...\n \n Genetics: well although I'm not 100% on top of my game in this area....let's see....how about this approach......The evolution of species by means of increasing numbers of chromosomes or the preservation of complex life forms in the struggle life.........well a possum, a redwood, and a kidney bean all possess 22 chromosomes........a fern has 480 chromosomes......eh......see my point?....unless I'm misunderstanding your approach on this point.....which could be probable since I'm dead tired and it's really late right now. \n \n O...the whole similarity argument again......yea God wasn't that creative...give him a break....he only had a day to for each thing.....you try creating every creature in a day....\n \n And lastly sharing viruses I don't know....but I'm sure that isn't going to prove nothing....and as for mutations....well I know of no observed beneficial mutations. Most mutations are harmful and complicate things not benefit. This isn't X-men or Metal Gear Solid......this is reality....no one has mutated and benefited from it.......these are just our own impurities I guess you could say as each generation further degenerates from our original glory from when we lived in Eden. Now I'm rambling...and I'm tired....these are just briefly touching each point to give you all something to chew on and so you can throw some more questions at me. If you're not satisfied with my response I'll try to answer each response better once.....anyways.....see ya later...I'm dead......",

   "OK, here we go:\n \n Black Phoenix said:\n \n \nabout 4400 years ago there was a flood...it covered the whole earth...and so on....but that is a huge topic that deserves another thread....and I suppose I'll answer your questions about the flood as well....you just have to remember I hate typing, writing or responding to anything for anything really, since I'm a bum. Yes, the flood would be able to explain the fossils and how they all became fossilized...of course that topic will most likely lead to dinosaurs and so on...but we'll tackle one issue one at a time.\n \n \n I think it's a well established fact that there never was a global flood, but that is another topic. But I'll stick to just how it applies to the fossil record.\n A global flood can NOT explain the order of the fossil record. Many fossils can be explained by floods but certainly not all fossils. Fossilized footprints or tracks or burrows could not possibly be formed in a flood, for instance. And you didn't even comment on the main point of my post, the order that fossils are found in. Why don't we find any fiddler crab fossils in stata with cambrian trilobite fossils? Why don't we find any rhinocerous fossils along side triceratops fossils? For that matter, why dont we find any dinosaur fossils after the KT extinction line? According to the YEC idea of hydrological sorting, the flood waters accounts for the order of the fossil record, similar sized organisms should be grouped together. This is exactly what we DON'T see, fossils are not grouped by size, they are grouped in a way that is ONLY explained by the theory of evolution. \n \n \nOk.....just to touch briefly on the fossil record is pretty much circle reasoning.....that's for later though....and the similarities are simple to explain....\n \n \n How is the fossil record circular?? I see YECs make this claim but they can't back it up. Certain fossils that are widely distributed and always found in a limited time span (determined by radiometric dating) are called index fossils. \n When a new or unknown fossil is discovered in the same strata as an index fossil, scientists can make a quick comparison and say the two organisms probably lived at roughly the same time. This is later verified by more rigourous dating techniques. But the point is this is a quick, unofficial generalization, the new fossil is not dated solely by the index fossil. Please explain how this is circular reasoning....\n \n \nwell I believe we inherited some of his traits or characteristics...whatever you want to call it...such as the need for companionship, the need to love....and all that stuff...so let's assume we inherited some of that laziness or his complacent laid back manner.....\n \n \n This is interesting, how could God, a perfect, all powerful, omniscient being, be lazy or complacent?\n \n \nwell let's just say when he was \"designing\" everything he just got lazy and made some small changes here...and when he was feeling like it he added spots here....a tail there...and you know what wa la.....tons of variety but with lots of similarities in the genetic structure and so forth because he didn't feel like getting to crazy....I don't know what God was doing...but just say he was to lazy to make us all extravagantly different. Therefore arguing similarities as a strong point of evolution doesn't really justify evolution or support it to be more correct....\n \n \n So let me get this straight, you're saying \"God was lazy\" is a better explaination than the morphological evidence for nested hierarchies???\n Come on! I'm not even talking about genetics here, just comparative anatomy. If God was so lazy why did he design so many different eyes? Why didn't he just make one kind of eye and give all seeing animals the same kind? Why do whales have lungs and fish have gills? They both live in water, why didn't God just give them both gills, that would have been the logical thing to do, making an animal that lives it's entire life in water with lungs for breathing air doesn't seem lazy, it seems stupid. But it makes sense when you look at it through evolution. the whale evolved from a land dwelling mammal, and mammals have lungs, not gills. Evolution doesn't go with the best solution, in this case gills, but only with what works. How do we know the whale was descended from a land dwelling animal, because we see it has vestigal hindlimbs, because it's flippers aren't like fish fins, they are modified, land dwelling forelimbs. What predictions does evolution make about the whale, that the further back in time we go, we will see the descendents of the whale and they will be more like land creatures the further back we go and that's exactly what we see. Let's look at the Therapsid fossils, the transitional line between reptiles and mammals. The early therapsids are clearly reptilian, but as time goes on, these animals become more and more mammilian. The reptilian second jaw joint slowly gets smaller and moves up the skull in successive fossils until it becomes the mammilian inner ear bones!\n This is perfectly explained by evolution, all the evidence supports the fact that therapsid reptiles evolved into mammals. Do you have a better explaination, one that is better supported by the evidence, something more than \"God was lazy\"? That's just one of the millions of examples you have to explain better than evolution does and produce empirical evidence for in order to support your false statement \"Therefore arguing similarities as a strong point of evolution doesn't really justify evolution or support it to be more correct....\" You're making statements that just aren't true, that are refuted by all the evidence and you have nothing to back you up save that you merely wish they were true. That's not evidence, that's only wishful thinking.\n \n \nThe evolution of species by means of increasing numbers of chromosomes or the preservation of complex life forms in the struggle life.........well a possum, a redwood, and a kidney bean all possess 22 chromosomes........a fern has 480 chromosomes......eh......see my point?....\n \n \n No, I don't see your point. a possum is still more genetically similar to a human than it is to a redwood, once again it's a nested hierarchy, only this time it's not based on comparative anatomy, but on geneticis. And as I said before, the nested hierarchy generated by comparing genetic structure is almost identical to the nested hierarchy genetated by comparing morphology. And while we're on genetics, out of the millions of genetic codes that could exist for protein coding genes, why do all living organisms have nearly the same code? Once again, the most logical, best supported answer is that all life descended from a common ancestor, not \"God was lazy\".\n \n \nO...the whole similarity argument again......yea God wasn't that creative...give him a break....he only had a day to for each thing.....you try creating every creature in a day....\n \n \n But you have failed to provide ANY evidence that God created anything.....\n \n \nAnd lastly sharing viruses I don't know....but I'm sure that isn't going to prove nothing\n \n \n Very unscientific attitude, you don't know anything about endogenous retroviruses, but your sure they prove nothing! Endogenous retroviruses randomly infect an organisms genome and leave a marker on an organisms genetic structure and are passed on by heredity. So every human has the same retroviral sequence in their genome. The odds against two different species being randomly infected by the same ERV and having it mark the exact same chromosomal sequence are literally billions to one. Chimpanzees and humans share SEVEN ERV's. The only answer is that chimps and humans share a common ancestor, just as predicted by evolution. If you have an alternate explaination, let's hear it and please provide evidence to back up your claim.\n \n \nand as for mutations....well I know of no observed beneficial mutations.\n \n \n Then you haven't done any research on mutations then. \n Here's a link for a page with a few examples of beneficial human mutations:\n Humanmutations \n \n Here's a link to another list of beneficial mutations:\n Generalmutations \n \n \nMost mutations are harmful and complicate things not \n benefit.\n \n \n No, most mutations are neutral, some are harmful, some are beneficial, depending on the environment they express themselves in. Most humans have about 50 to 100 neutral mutations in there genetic structure.\n \n \nThis isn't X-men or Metal Gear Solid......this is reality....no one has mutated and benefited from it......\n \n \n Yes, this is reality, not the simple,mythic world described in the Bible by primitive goatherders and beneficial mutations have been observed, so they are a fact. But if you are laboring under the idea that mutations in real life are even remotely similar to the X-Men, you seriously don't understand how mutations work. Do yourself a favor and do a little research. AS to beneficial mutations, see the links above, or look up nylon eating bacteria for an example.\n \n \nthese are just our own impurities I guess you could say as each generation further degenerates from our original glory from when we lived in Eden.\n \n \n Have any evidence of this? Because mutations are not impurities and we are not degenerating from when we lived in Eden because Eden never really existed.\n \n So get some sleep, come back refreshed and we can continue our discussion.",

If this is the case, why would he run out of creative steam when he came to the actual reason he made the whole thing in the first place- as a place for life to live in?\n \n Another problem with your lazy God notion is that God is generally considered to be omnipotent and outside of time in Christianity, which mean timescales are irrelevant to such an entity that is able to circumvent such a limitation.",

   "Well thanks to you all for your patients. Just want to clarify that these next few posts are concerning Mach's original post and Demon38's post earlier on this thread. I tried to give answeres as concise and exact....but since this is such an enormous topic it may seem very brief. Hopefully we can go into each point that you may feel wasn't an adequate response for you. It was a lot of stuff in short period. Sorry for sounding like a smart aleck in response to Mach's I was in a bad mood when I had wrote my response to his argument. \n \n Alrighty here we go...I know most of you thought this day would never come..but here we go.....remember I tried to be nice so sorry Mach....\n \n This is in response to Mach's post at the beginning of the thread....\n \n ]\"....Typcial Christian brainwash rhetoric:\n \n 1. God exists and is unknowable-\n A logical contradiction....\"\n \n Well you are right God exists.....unkowable...well not exactly. We are just not capable to comprehend God to the fullest extent...but the Bible is one of the best ways to \"know\" God...and praying and so forth....this isn't a debatable topic really...\n\n \n I know, but a wise man once wrote to me that if you believe something exists, yet you define is as unknowable, it's a logical contradiction. If gods existence IS knowable, then you suggest we can find plenty of evidence to support his existence, which we know we cannot. So even before we start down the path of discussing divine creation (vs evolution), we cannot even get out of the gate because the very concept of a creator, as an unknowable, is illogical. And last time I checked I haven't seen god on CNN giving interviews for why he lets baby die in horrible accidents, etc. There is no plausible theory of creation from an unknowable god that is meaningful. We can argue about the merits of evolution as well, but we first should start with the lack of any other reasonably justifiable theory. Creation simply is not one of them.\n \n \n\"2. You know God exists on faith-\n -Irrational, faith cannot separate truth from falsity \"\n \n Well that's a valid point from your point of view, but if you were educated in at least my denomination of faith (Assembly of God although I don't claim to be a Christian since I don't want to however I agree with the concepts and was thoroughly educated in it) you would have a better understanding of the whole faith process....but you all don't want a sermon you want science. I don't really base my belief in God in faith, I base my beliefs more on reason, logic, and events that have occurred in my life.\n\n I was raised catholic, and aside from the knowledge that everyone around me misled me out of ignorance, I had an OK experince. It's not the experience, it's the things they asked me to believe in that simply did not make sense. To ask why, I'm told either \"because it's in the bible\", or \"god works in mysterious ways\". That just wasn't good enough. If you really do enjoy logic and reason, you'll find one day that it's a chocie. You either embrace it entirely, or you'll always be open to the illogical or unreasonable. \n \n \nUnfortunately Christianity has come to posses a very sour taste for many Americans due to the problems in the Catholic Church, and like you stated constantly being a social and political power base; Which I think is very sad....but the reflection of mans failure to accurately portray and convey what Jesus's teachings were should not hinder your faith in God. \n \n Yet any teachings from word of mouth or some human written book I will still scrutinize, be it from catholics, AoG, or a science text book (To the best of my knowledge). It's not the words or who it's presented, or the rampant sodomy of catholic priests that makes me disagree. It's because it's simply not justifiable.\n \n \nYour whole argument over all though has nothing to do with evolution....till the middle end portion.....which you assume me to not believe in medicine or science?...hmm.....I do....surprise...I go to the doctor regularly....see it is necessary for you to understand that God gave man the gift of science after we fell from Eden as a means of survival other than praying.\n \n It is. It starts at the beginning premise.\n If you define creation as created by god, you start with the existence of god as one of your premises. That's what I disagree with :)\n \n \nI don't claim to understand God 100% but I think I have a pretty decent grasp on it. You have obviously been burned by professed Christians, church, or maybe God didn't answer a prayer of yours....I don't know...but I'm genuinely sorry for it. \n\n No no. That's just it. I'm very happy, never had a bad experience per se with religion or religious people in my life, I just disagree with religion when people try to use it as justification for something real. I think it's not only wrong, but frankly, is an attack on everything I value. That's why the response gets emotional somtimes. \n \n \nHowever you are simply venting your problems with religion, which I agree with you on, you aren't arguing evolution vs. creation though. Evolution came from a bored guy who didn't want to accept God as the reason for everything...which I think was good because it has promoted peoples interest in science thus allowing us to make incredible advances, unfortunately Darwin had to destroy many ignorant people's faith in God, because they really didn't know what they believed in....so they accepted the \"facts\". \n \n \n I think evolution is a result of mankind's pursuit for knowledge and understanding, with regards to the age old question....why are we here. Is this not a noble pursuit? Is pursuing it usning evidence and logical conclusions not the only way to proceed? I can tell you, if you fully understand all of the concepts involved with evolution, you will be...more knowledgeable, and a great many questions will be answered for you. Not left in some obscure statement like \"god works in mysterious ways\".\n \n \nNow it is true that I learned about God, and the whole bit from my parents and church, but that doesn't mean I didn't eventually come to accept, I simply sought the answers that I needed and found them. You can't refute the Bible, almost any literature teacher or anyone will proclaim that it is one of the most sound books written regardless if they believe in it or not. \n \n That's an entirely different debate. And you'd reject it, but I'll present it, and you can verify it yourself, or through reading neutral/non-christian literature. The bible is not sound in any meaningful definition of \"sound\". It's filled with contradictions, inaccuracies, and for the most part, is a tool for convincing people to adopt a certain flavor of denying reason and accepting the absurd.\n \n \nI was never making an argument against science, I'm making an argument against a flawed theory that desperately needs to be corrected. Anyways, I'm going to go finish up my response to Demon who actually posted some points that \"support\" evolution. I'm not arrogant, sorry if I come across this way, it simply makes me angry for people to have their faith destroyed based on one man's proposal, well actually there was a guy that was before Darwin, but I forget....it's simply been one man's proposal that was built on continuously into a hideous monster. You'll understand my views better as we go through this long nightmare of an argument. \n \n \n I'd be happy to attack the problem at the bottom, down in the theory of evolution, but you should realize it's only more difficult. A mountain of logic can be built upon a single illogical premise...I'd rather address it at the root then address the mountain of madness that awaits us.\n \n -Mach",

   "Black Phoenix said:\n \n \nI'm going on vacation in a couple days and with the hollidays and stuff it's going to take some time\n \n \n Well, enjoy yourself and Happy Holidays!\n \n \nI'll argue that first point, the fossil record, because I know for a fact that the evolutionist's fossil record of perfection in strict order is \n wrong.\n \n \n Make sure you give us sources to double check your claims, because the fossil record is in a strict order and the only theory that describes it is evolution. No out of place fossils found to date and new finds continue to support only evolution. I wouldn't use Dr. Dino as a source, as has been mentioned before, Hovind is a liar and charlaton. And I would hope you wouldn't try to use the Paluxy tracks since it's been shown they aren't human tracks......\n \n If you want to continue with the debate, here's a sample of what you're up against, from the Geological Society of America:\n \n The rock record is a treasure trove of fossils, and by 1841, eighteen years before Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species, geologists had not only assembled much of the geologic time scale from physical relationships among bodies of rock, but they had also recognized that fossils document profound changes in life throughout Earth\u00b9s history. Darwin showed that biological evolution provides an explanation for these changes. Since the time of Darwin, geologists have continued to uncover details of life's history, and biologists have continued to elucidate the process of evolution. Thus, our understanding of life\u00b9s evolution has expanded through diverse kinds of research, much of it in fields unknown to Darwin such as genetics, biochemistry, and micropaleontology. In short, the concept of organic evolution has not only withstood the test of time - the ultimate test of any scientific construct - but it has been greatly enriched. \n \n And from the National Academy of Sciences:\n \n In Darwin's time, however, paleontology was still a rudimentary science, and large parts of the geological succession of stratified rocks were unknown or inadequately studied. Darwin, therefore, worried about the rarity of truly intermediate forms. Creationists have then and now seized on this as a weakness in evolutionary theory. Indeed, although gaps in the paleontological record remain even now, many have been filled with the researches of paleontologists since Darwin's time. Hundreds of thousands of fossil organisms found in welldated rock sequences represent a succession of forms through time and manifest many evolutionary transitions. . . There have been so many discoveries of intermediate forms between fish and amphibians, between amphibians and reptiles, between reptiles and mammals, and even along the primate line of descent that it is often difficult to identify categorically the line to which a particular genus or species belongs.  \n \n I could go on and on with quotes from the experts, but you get the point. The fossil record supports the theory of evolution and NO OTHER THEORY!\n \n \nAs for the genetics bit I admit that I am very much lacking in that area and it doesn't matter to me due to the evidence in my own \n life.\n \n \n What evidence in your own life contradicts genetics?!? You seem to be laboring under the impression that evolution equals atheism. Please note that the majority of the worlds christians accept the theory of evolution.",

   "While we're waiting and since this is to be the argument ending last creation/evolution thread ever...let me post this tidbit about a reformed atheist.\n \n NEW YORK Dec 9, 2004 - A British philosophy professor who has been a leading champion of atheism for more than a half-century has changed his mind. He now believes in God more or less based on scientific evidence, and says so on a video released Thursday.\n \n At age 81, after decades of insisting belief is a mistake, Antony Flew has concluded that some sort of intelligence or first cause must have created the universe. A super-intelligence is the only good explanation for the origin of life and the complexity of nature, Flew said in a telephone interview from England.\n \n Flew said he's best labeled a deist like Thomas Jefferson, whose God was not actively involved in people's lives.\n \n \"I'm thinking of a God very different from the God of the Christian and far and away from the God of Islam, because both are depicted as omnipotent Oriental despots, cosmic Saddam Husseins,\" he said. \"It could be a person in the sense of a being that has intelligence and a purpose, I suppose.\"\n \n Flew first made his mark with the 1950 article \"Theology and Falsification,\" based on a paper for the Socratic Club, a weekly Oxford religious forum led by writer and Christian thinker C.S. Lewis.\n \n Over the years, Flew proclaimed the lack of evidence for God while teaching at Oxford, Aberdeen, Keele, and Reading universities in Britain, in visits to numerous U.S. and Canadian campuses and in books, articles, lectures and debates.\n \n There was no one moment of change but a gradual conclusion over recent months for Flew, a spry man who still does not believe in an afterlife.\n \n Yet biologists' investigation of DNA \"has shown, by the almost unbelievable complexity of the arrangements which are needed to produce (life), that intelligence must have been involved,\" Flew says in the new video, \"Has Science Discovered God?\"\n \n The video draws from a New York discussion last May organized by author Roy Abraham Varghese's Institute for Metascientific Research in Garland, Texas. Participants were Flew; Varghese; Israeli physicist Gerald Schroeder, an Orthodox Jew; and Roman Catholic philosopher John Haldane of Scotland's University of St. Andrews.\n \n The first hint of Flew's turn was a letter to the August-September issue of Britain's Philosophy Now magazine. \"It has become inordinately difficult even to begin to think about constructing a naturalistic theory of the evolution of that first reproducing organism,\" he wrote.\n \n The letter commended arguments in Schroeder's \"The Hidden Face of God\" and \"The Wonder of the World\" by Varghese, an Eastern Rite Catholic layman.\n \n This week, Flew finished writing the first formal account of his new outlook for the introduction to a new edition of his \"God and Philosophy,\" scheduled for release next year by Prometheus Press.\n \n Prometheus specializes in skeptical thought, but if his belief upsets people, well \"that's too bad,\" Flew said. \"My whole life has been guided by the principle of Plato's Socrates: Follow the evidence, wherever it leads.\"\n \n Last week, Richard Carrier, a writer and Columbia University graduate student, posted new material based on correspondence with Flew on the atheistic www.infidels.org Web page. Carrier assured atheists that Flew accepts only a \"minimal God\" and believes in no afterlife.\n \n Flew's \"name and stature are big. Whenever you hear people talk about atheists, Flew always comes up,\" Carrier said. Still, when it comes to Flew's reversal, \"apart from curiosity, I don't think it's like a big deal.\"\n \n Flew told The Associated Press his current ideas have some similarity with American \"intelligent design\" theorists, who see evidence for a guiding force in the construction of the universe. He accepts Darwinian evolution but doubts it can explain the ultimate origins of life.\n \n A Methodist minister's son, Flew became an atheist at 15.\n \n Early in his career, he argued that no conceivable events could constitute proof against God for believers, so skeptics were right to wonder whether the concept of God meant anything at all.\n \n Another landmark was his 1984 \"The Presumption of Atheism,\" playing off the presumption of innocence in criminal law. Flew said the debate over God must begin by presuming atheism, putting the burden of proof on those arguing that God exists. \n \n http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=315976\n\n Needed to clear this up.\n http://www.secweb.org/asset.asp?AssetID=138\n \nSorry to Disappoint, but I'm Still an Atheist!\n by Antony Flew\n \n [Editor's note: This article no longer represents Flew's current position. For the most recent information, see Antony Flew Considers God...Sort Of.]\n \n \n Antony Flew in the 50sRichard C. Carrier, current Editor in Chief of the Secular Web, tells me that \"the internet has now become awash with rumors\" that I \"have converted to Christianity, or am at least no longer an atheist.\" Perhaps because I was born too soon to be involved in the internet world I had heard nothing of this rumour. So Mr. Carrier asks me to explain myself in cyberspace. This, with the help of the Internet Infidels, I now attempt.\n \n Those rumours speak false. I remain still what I have been now for over fifty years, a negative atheist. By this I mean that I construe the initial letter in the word 'atheist' in the way in which everyone construes the same initial letter in such words as 'atypical' and 'amoral'. For I still believe that it is impossible either to verify or to falsify - to show to be false - what David Hume in his Dialogues concerning Natural Religion happily described as \"the religious hypothesis.\" The more I contemplate the eschatological teachings of Christianity and Islam the more I wish I could demonstrate their falsity.\n \n I first argued the impossibility in 'Theology and Falsification', a short paper originally published in 1950 and since reprinted over forty times in different places, including translations into German, Italian, Spanish, Danish, Welsh, Finnish and Slovak. The most recent reprint was as part of 'A Golden Jubilee Celebration' in the October/November 2001 issue of the semi-popular British journal Philosophy Now, which the editors of that periodical have graciously allowed the Internet Infidels to publish online: see \"Theology & Falsification.\"\n \n I can suggest only one possible source of the rumours. Several weeks ago I submitted to the Editor of Philo (The Journal of the Society of Humanist Philosophers) a short paper making two points which might well disturb atheists of the more positive kind. The point more relevant here was that it can be entirely rational for believers and negative atheists to respond in quite different ways to the same scientific developments.\n \n We negative atheists are bound to see the Big Bang cosmology as requiring a physical explanation; and that one which, in the nature of the case, may nevertheless be forever inaccessible to human beings. But believers may, equally reasonably, welcome the Big Bang cosmology as tending to confirm their prior belief that \"in the beginning\" the Universe was created by God.\n \n Again, negative atheists meeting the argument that the fundamental constants of physics would seem to have been 'fine tuned' to make the emergence of mankind possible will first object to the application of either the frequency or the propensity theory of probability 'outside' the Universe, and then go on to ask why omnipotence should have been satisfied to produce a Universe in which the origin and rise of the human race was merely possible rather than absolutely inevitable. But believers are equally bound and, on their opposite assumptions, equally justified in seeing the Fine Tuning Argument as providing impressive confirmation of a fundamental belief shared by all the three great systems of revealed theistic religion - Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. For all three are agreed that we human beings are members of a special kind of creatures, made in the image of God and for a purpose intended by God.\n \n In short, I recognize that developments in physics coming on the last twenty or thirty years can reasonably be seen as in some degree confirmatory of a previously faith-based belief in god, even though they still provide no sufficient reason for unbelievers to change their minds. They certainly have not persuaded me.\n \n Note from the Editor: in accord with Flew's remarks, on how the Fine Tuning Argument by itself leads more readily to agnosticism than to theism or positive atheism, see Richard Carrier's Response to James Hannam's 'In Defense of the Fine Tuning Design Argument' (2001).\n\n http://www.secweb.org/asset.asp?AssetID=369\n \n\n Antony Flew Considers God...Sort Of\n by Richard Carrier\n \n Antony Flew is considering the possibility that there might be a God. Sort of. Flew is one of the most renowned atheists of the 20th century, even making the shortlist of \"Contemporary Atheists\" at About.com. So if he has changed his mind to any degree, whatever you may think of his reasons, the event itself is certainly newsworthy. After hearing of this, I contacted Antony directly to discuss it, and I thought it fitting to cut short any excessive speculation or exaggeration by writing a brief report on, well, what's going on.\n \n Once upon a time, a rumor hit the internet that Flew had converted to Christianity. The myth appeared in 2001 and popped up again in 2003. On each occasion, Flew refuted the claim personally, standing by his response to its first occasion with his own reply for publication at the Secular Web (Antony Flew, \"Sorry to Disappoint, but I'm Still an Atheist!\" 2001). So I was quite skeptical the third time around. But this time, things have indeed changed somewhat from where Flew stood in his 2001 article. Antony and I exchanged letters on the issue recently, and what I report here about his current views comes from him directly.\n \n The news of his \"conversion\" this time came from a number of avenues, but the three I have good information on are an interview with Gary Habermas soon to be published by Philosophia Christi in which Flew appears to depart from his past views about God, a letter Flew wrote to a popular philosophy journal expressing doubts about the ability of science to explain the origin of life (\"On Darwinism and Theology,\" Philosophy Now 47, August/September 2004, p. 22; cf. also Flew's Review of Roy Varghese's The Wonder of the World), and, just recently on national TV (the October 9 episode of \"Faith Under Fire\"), J. P. Moreland used Flew's \"conversion\" as an argument for supernaturalism.\n \n The fact of the matter is: Flew hasn't really decided what to believe. He affirms that he is not a Christian--he is still quite certain that the Gods of Christianity or Islam do not exist, that there is no revealed religion, and definitely no afterlife of any kind (he stands by everything he argued in his 2001 book Merely Mortal: Can You Survive Your Own Death?). But he is increasingly persuaded that some sort of Deity brought about this universe, though it does not intervene in human affairs, nor does it provide any postmortem salvation. He says he has in mind something like the God of Aristotle, a distant, impersonal \"prime mover.\" It might not even be conscious, but a mere force. In formal terms, he regards the existence of this minimal God as a hypothesis that, at present, is perhaps the best explanation for why a universe exists that can produce complex life. But he is still unsure. In fact, he asked that I not directly quote him yet, until he finally composes his new introduction to a final edition of his book God and Philosophy, due out next year. He hasn't completed it yet, precisely because he is still examining the evidence and thinking things over. Anything he says now, could change tomorrow.\n \n I also heard a rumor that Flew claimed in a private letter that the kalam cosmological argument proved the existence of God (see relevant entries in Cosmological Arguments). But he assures me that is not what he believes. He said that, at best, the kalam is an argument for a first cause in the Aristotelian sense, and nothing more--and he maintains that, kalam or not, it is still not logically necessary that the universe had a cause at all, much less a \"personal\" cause. Flew's tentative, mechanistic Deism is not based on any logical proofs, but solely on physical, scientific evidence, or the lack thereof, and is therefore subject to change with more information--and he confesses he has not been able to keep up with the relevant literature in science and theology, which means we should no longer treat him as an expert on this subject (as Moreland apparently did).\n \n Once Flew gives me permission to quote him I will expand this article with more information about his views and the reasons for them. That will have to wait for when Flew himself has finally mulled things over and come to something like a stable decision about what he thinks is most probable, and that may not happen until the release of his 2005 edition of God and Philosophy. For now, I think his view can best be described as questioning, rather than committed. And there is much to criticize in his rationale even for considering Aristotelian Deism. He is most impressed, he says, by Gerald Schroeder's book The Hidden Face of God: How Science Reveals the Ultimate Truth (2001), but Schroeder (a Jewish theologian and physicist) has been heavily criticized for \"fudging\" the facts to fit his argument--see Mark Perakh, \"Not a Very Big Bang about Genesis\" (1999); and my own discussion in \"Are the Odds Against the Origin of Life Too Great to Accept?\" (2000), as well as my peer-reviewed article \"The Argument from Biogenesis,\" soon to appear in Biology & Philosophy. Flew points out that he has not yet had time to examine any of the critiques of Schroeder. Nor has he examined any of the literature of the past five or ten years on the science of life's origin, which has more than answered his call for \"constructing a naturalistic theory\" of the origin of life. This is not to say any particular theory has been proven--rather, there are many viable theories fitting all the available evidence that have yet to be refuted, so Flew cannot maintain (as in his letter to Philosophy Now) that it is \"inordinately difficult even to begin to think about\" such theories. I have pointed all this out to him, and he is thinking it over.\n \n For now, the story of Antony Flew's change of mind should not be exaggerated. We should wait for him to complete his investigation of the matter and declare a more definite conclusion, before claiming he has \"converted,\" much less to any particular religious view.\n \n Update (December 2004)\n \n Flew has now given me permission to quote him directly. I asked him point blank what he would mean if he ever asserted that \"probably God exists,\" to which he responded (in a letter in his own hand, dated 19 October 2004):\n \n I do not think I will ever make that assertion, precisely because any assertion which I am prepared to make about God would not be about a God in that sense ... I think we need here a fundamental distinction between the God of Aristotle or Spinoza and the Gods of the Christian and the Islamic Revelations.\n \n Rather, he would only have in mind \"the non-interfering God of the people called Deists--such as Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin.\" Indeed, he remains adamant that \"theological propositions can neither be verified nor falsified by experience,\" exactly as he argued in \"Theology and Falsification.\" Regarding J. P. Moreland using Flew in support of Moreland's own belief in the supernatural, Flew says \"my God is not his. His is Swinburne's. Mine is emphatically not good (or evil) or interested in human conduct\" and does not perform miracles of any kind. Furthermore, Flew took great care to emphasize repeatedly to me that:\n \n My one and only piece of relevant evidence [for an Aristotelian God] is the apparent impossibility of providing a naturalistic theory of the origin from DNA of the first reproducing species ... [In fact] the only reason which I have for beginning to think of believing in a First Cause god is the impossibility of providing a naturalistic account of the origin of the first reproducing organisms.\n \n He cites, in fact, the improbability arguments of Schroeder, which I have refuted online, and the entire argument to the impossibility of natural biogenesis I have refuted in a forthcoming article in Biology & Philosophy.\n \n So what of the claim that Flew was persuaded by the Kalam Cosmological Argument? Flew \"cannot recall\" writing any letter to Geivett claiming \"the kalam cosmological argument is a sound argument\" for God but he confesses his memory fails him often now so he can't be sure. Nevertheless, I specifically asked what Antony thought of the Kalam, to which he answered:\n \n If and insofar as it is supposed to prove the existence of a First Cause of the Big Bang, I have no objection, but this is not at all the same as a proof of the existence of a spirit and all the rest of Richard Swinburne's definition of 'God' which is presently accepted as standard throughout the English speaking and philosophical world.\n \n Also, regarding another rumor that Flew has been attending Quaker meetings, Antony says \"I have, I think, attended Quaker meetings on at least 3 or 4 occasions, and one was at the wedding of a cousin,\" and thus hardly a religious statement on his part but a family affair. Nevertheless, for him and his family generally, he says \"I think the main attraction\" of Quakerism has been \"the lack of doctrines.\" On the whole God thing, though, Flew is still examining the articles I sent him, so he may have more to say in the future.\n",
