I think traveler is sniffing the proverbial modeling glue. What we are seeing in these pictures is normal facial expression. As AMD says, anyone can look bad in a series of pictures. Traveler, it's like if you have a DVD or VCR player, if you hit pause while they are focused on someones face, the person will often look slightly strange in the picture. It is because the face goes through an enormous range of expression as we speak. When we are watching it in real time, it seems normal, and we do not notice each individual expression, we put them together and use it to interpret the total meaning. When you see a facial expression as in a picture, it is like half a sentence from a book taken out of context. You know, traveler and rapture seem to be two of a kind...jeesh.",
