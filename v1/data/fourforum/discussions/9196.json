They shouldn't take the job and then refuse to do it.\n\n \n That may be allowed by law, but I don't consider it moral in many cases. If a company requires their Jewish employees to work on the sabbath clearly knowing they are strongly opposed to it on religious grounds, I have a lot less respect for that company. Or if they fire someone for taking the sabbath off. In my view, that's infringing on religious freedom. Since employees have enormous latitude in the way they treat their employees (too much so, sometimes, IMO), you have a point in terms of what they're allowed to do, but I don't think it's right.\n \n In regards to a govt however, the employees don't work for a company, and so I feel there should be more oversight in terms of whether or not peoples' religious freedom is infringed. Policy should definitely take the matter into account and so I applaud SA for doing that.\n \n \nSure, but a sausage factory isn't going to stop using pig meat if a Jew gets hired.

   "That may be allowed by law, but I don't consider it moral in many cases. If a company requires their Jewish employees to work on the sabbath clearly knowing they are strongly opposed to it on religious grounds, I have a lot less respect for that company. Or if they fire someone for taking the sabbath off. In my view, that's infringing on religious freedom. Since employees have enormous latitude in the way they treat their employees (too much so, sometimes, IMO), you have a point in terms of what they're allowed to do, but I don't think it's right.\n \n In regards to a govt however, the employees don't work for a company, and so I feel there should be more oversight in terms of whether or not peoples' religious freedom is infringed. Policy should definitely take the matter into account and so I applaud SA for doing that.\n \n \n \n Those are all cases where it is very definitive on the front end that working in such an environment would go against one's religious values. (All except the \"treating-people-equally\" example, that is.) Most of the time when this becomes an issue things are not so clear-cut as that--like cases where the employee finds out AFTER he's been working there for a long time that suddnly he is going to be forced to work on the sabbath. Or suddenly changing their policies leaving their religious employees with an unfair delimma that pits their religion against their livelihood. There comes a point where the employer should do the right and ethical thing and respect peoples' religions.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Then the first thing that should happen in a job interview is to find out if the tentative employee has any relgious convictions that would keep him or her from performing the job duties that are to be performed. If the answer is yes, then the person who is seeking employment needs to find a company that coincides with his or her religious beliefs. That way conflicts can be avoided.",

That is simply reality. Now you can call it prejudice if you want. You can call it hate if you want.

Expecting a religious person who believes this way to validate a homosexual marriage by filling out paperwork or conducting a civil ceremony is the same idea as expecting a Jewish employee to eat pork. South Africa realizes this apparently, and I applaud them for it because most of the time proponents of gay marriage treat the relgious view as nothing more than prejudice, and it's not. It really is religious belief. This is the bottom line, and I don't know how I can make this any more clear cut.

IMO you can only exercise your rights up to the point where they infringe on someone else's rights.\n \n For example:\n \n A Jehovah's Witness is admitted to a small town emergency room after a severe car accident. She has the right to exercise her autonomy and refuse a blood transfusion due to her religious beliefs, even if it will mean her death.\n \n The next week the attending physician of this emergency room happens to be a Jehovah's Witness. If someone is admitted with severe blood loss, he does NOT have the right to harm this patient by refusing to provide him with the standard, legal, medical treatment of blood transfusion, even though according to his religious beliefs doing so would prevent this patient from obtaining eternal salvation. He needs to perform the blood transfusion or find a job where that is not an issue.\n \n I feel the same way with regards to the marriage commissioner refusing to marry a same-sex couple.

   "Yes, and it that belief IS respected already by the govt, because they given time off at Christmas.\n\n I disagree with your claim that any \"belief\" is respected by giving time off at Christmas. People who don't believe in Christianity are given off time as well.\n Is their \"disbelief\" being respected when they get Christmas time off?\n \n \n \nHey, nothing like an irrelevant point to back up your arguments ...\n\n It's entirely relevant to pointing out that Christmas is not SOLELY a religious issue for Christians.\n Christmas has secular issues as well. Both atheists and christians like to huddle around their christmas tree and give presents. This tradition, and the respecting of it, IS NOT regarding a religious belief.\n \n If Christians want to feel their \"belief\" is \"respected\" because they get time off at Christmas, so be it. They are entitled to their \"beliefs\" and the pretense that they are being \"respected\"...\n \n \n \nIn regards to the Christmas holiday, yes!\n\n Oh yeah. Now who is the one making irrelevant commentary?\n We're talking about whether or not OUR government would be doing for \"gay marriage\" officiators what South Africa is doing for gay marriage officiators.\n Do you think that the South African policy would be adopted in the U.S., regarding allowing marriage officiators who don't approve to opt out of doing their job?\n \n \n \nLOL! Go tell a recruiter he has to stop taking pretty much anyone walking through his door that's between the ages allowed, and see what happens. Soldiers don't go through a hiring process.\n\n They go through the same \"hiring\" process as any other job.\n Disabilities to prevent you from doing the job? You don't get hired.\n Criminal record for raping women? You don't get hired.\n \n The only difference is the military's job need is greater.\n If McDonald's was hiring and they had the type of deficit in workers that the military often sees, the same thing would occur.\n It's not about a \"hiring\" process, and this non-sequitur is just another attempt to sideline the discussion.\n \n The issue of \"hiring\" process is irrelevant here to my point.\n HOW would a \"hiring\" process suddenly make it okay or not okay for me to stand up and say \"I don't believe in hurting people, so I'm not going to do my job today.\"\n \n \n \nThey sign up for military service. There are benefits given to sign up, but it's not the same as what you're talking about. If you're of age, and you go see the recruiter, --they'll take you. Especially right now because of the Iraq situation. Heck, the DoD has been quietly trying to get the maximum age for new recruits raised to 42 ... There are reasons it's called a \"volunteer army.\"\n\n How is it a \"volunteer\" army any more than any type of employment is \"volunteer\"?\n \n \n \nYou tell me. Should it? Most employers won't because they know better and want to avoid discrimination.\n\n If it's an excuse for somebody not to do their job, maybe it should be asked.\n ========================================================\n \n And don't think I didn't notice that you dropped the religious beliefs on racism issue Jyoshu.\n Some people have RELIGIOUS beliefs regarding racism and the superiority / inferiority of blacks.

   "Lets look at this example for a minute. In your second example, the doctor who is a Jehovahs Witness has already agreed to do a certain level of care. The idea that this doctor has a change of heart at the last minute is unfair to those that already understood this person to be performing a certain task...IE a contract already existed. The conflict is a break of contract..not a religious belief as you try to disguise it as. \n\n I think you're trying to shift this from a public practice issue to a private practice issue.\n If somebody has a \"change of heart\" in the middle of treating somebody, I think that should be relevant and held against the doctor. Another excellent example would be the San Diego case where a lesbian couple were trying to get impregnated, and after caring for the lesbians for months (and taking their money) the medical practice suddenly declared that it violated their beliefs to impregnate the lesbians.\n \n But suppose this wasn't a \"private\" practice issue involving a change of heart. Suppose it's a hospital where emergency care is provided.\n Should a patient have to call another doctor over because the Jehova's Witness standards on blood transfusions are not necessary?\n Or should the Jevhoa's Witness realize that his restrictions are not conducive to his environment and what is expected from him?\n \n \n \nLets say this doctor works at a doctors office that said doctor created and where they only do care that is in agreement with Jehovahs Witness creed and this is well known. If someone comes in that needs a care that goes against the care of the doctors office then should they be forced to provide the care anyway? \n That would be the better way to look at your example.\n\n \"doctors office\"? Private practice.\n \n In this case, it's more like we had a doctor's office that had an agreement to provide care. And that care has been expanded to include blood transfusions.\n \n The Jehova's Witness secretary who works there doesn't like blood transfusions, and refuses to fill out paperwork for anybody who is having that procedure done.\n \n The secretary should either find different work, or get over her issues. (\"her issues\" not being her religion, but the issue that people are going to have that procedure done whether she likes it or not.)\n People have a right to practice THEIR religion and restrict THEIR OWN life. They don't have a right to presume to extend their restrictions upon others by not doing their job.",

   "??? Making a moral judgement is EXACTLY what you are supposed to do when making legislation, and if you aren't you have no business being a legislator. People vote legislators in because they think that legislator's moral judgements are best for the country.\nI believe Kronus addressed this; I'm not a politician (thank God!), but a Civil Servant.\n \n \nBut we're not talking about making a moral call on every or any issue. We're talking about an issue that is downright anathema from a religious standpoint to some people.\nBut by creating such exceptions you undermine the entire system. The entire point of it is that as a Civil Servant you don't make moral judgments in an official capacity: it's not your job. If you really find something that offensive you vote privately against it or you quit. I work for the Crown Prosecution Service; am I justified in refusing to work on cases where I see the victim as a party to something against my beliefs? I know plenty of Muslims at the Foreign Office, should they refuse to work on anything connected to Iraq because of their religion? Of course not. As I say the system only works through impartiality; if you start making exceptions the thing is meaningless.\n \n \nI think the issue itself needs to be taken into account, here. Again, I reiterate what I said to Matthew: you're making it more complicated than it is.\nYeah, I take your point. Compared to the actual legislation this clause is a minor point. But I still think it's wrong, and therefore worthy of discussion.\n \n \nThe same idea that would allow a Jewish person to pass on eating pork if it were suddenly expected for him or her to do it when it wasn't before. \nYour analogy is flawed: the registrar is not being asked to do anything against their religion themselves, just oversee it in others. A more apt analogy would probably be a Jewish waiter refusing to serve pork to any customer because of their religious beliefs...\n \n \nNo, we do. I have no idea what they have in the UK, but we have a Civil Service. Wikipedia has a good article on it, check it out.\nIndeed, both countries have a Civil Service. As you say, who else is going to do all the work?\n \n \nAnd not to let confusion over the term cloud the issue, have you re-read her post, keeping in mind that she's not the one writing the laws?

To quote Sir Humphrey, a Civil Servant from 'Yes, Minister' a political comedy:\n \n \nHacker: We are discussing right and wrong.\n Sir Humphrey: You may be, Minister, but I'm not.

The individual in question is given total freedom to decide for themselves which is most important to them, that particular job or some religious belief, and then to act on that decision.

You seem to be looking at this entirely from the standpoint of what's ethical for the employee to do, while I'm also looking at what's ethical for the employer to do. Imagine a situation where an employer had a lots of Jewish employees for years, then ony day out of the blue said \"ok, now you have to start eating pork. What? Doesn't jibe with your beliefs? Tough!
