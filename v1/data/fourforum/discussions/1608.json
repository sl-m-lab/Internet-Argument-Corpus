   "What I found especially offensive about the ruling ov the DC court of appeals decision was that not only did they fail to correctly cite supreme court precedent, they drew the rediculous conclusion that DC residents do not have the same rights as the rest of us. \n \n I think that it is time to force the second amendment debate on the supreme court. You have the 9th and the dc court of appeals in direct contradiction to the 1st, 3rd, 5th and tenth on a subject constitutional interpetation. \n \n You will note that in the sidebar notes of that decision, it is specifically not a finding on the second amendment, but only on the second amendment as it applies to DC residents. Then, the second amendment issue is almost completely swept under the rug when it comes to the presented cases.\n \n Take, for example, the guys who wanted to purchace handguns. The courts ruling was that since they had not attempted to apply for a permit and been refused, they could not petition the court for relief. They made a similar argument in reference to the taxi comissioner who was opposed to the trigger lock statute. Since she had not been prohibited from owning a shotgun, has not been prosocuted for not using her trigger lock, and it is unlikely that ever would be, she is not justified in petitioning the court for relief.\n \n This makes me wonder why the NRA, with all their money and all their lawyers, bothered to fight this case. The courts have always maintained that you have to show cause in a lawsuit. You have to show that you have somehow been injured (or in this case that your rights have been infringed) before petitioning the court for relief. Surely somebody on the NRA legal team caught this in law school.........",

   "\n I think that it is time to force the second amendment debate on the supreme court. You have the 9th and the dc court of appeals in direct contradiction to the 1st, 3rd, 5th and tenth on a subject constitutional interpetation. \n \n\n Oh really, what specific rulings by the 1st, 3rd, and 10th circuit courts are you referring to? I've read the rulings by the 1st, 3rd, and 10 circuits courts on the matter and I don't understand what you're talking about. \n \n \"Appellant, Peter B. Thomas, argues that the City of Portland, Maine, and various city officials infringed his constitutional rights by denying him a permit to carry a concealed handgun. Established case law makes clear that the federal Constitution grants appellant no right to carry a concealed handgun. See, e.g., United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174, 178, 59 S.Ct. 816, 818, 83 L.Ed. 1206 (1939) (second amendment applies only to weapons that have a 'reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia.')\"\n Thomas v. Members of City Council of Portland (1st Cir. 1984) \n \n \"Appellant Raymond Rybar, Jr. was convicted following a conditional guilty plea to two counts of violating 18 U.S.C. Section(s) 922(o), which makes it 'unlawful for any person to transfer or possess a machine gun.' On appeal, he argues that the district court erred in rejecting his challenge to that provision as beyond Congress' commerce power and as violating the Second Amendment. Neither challenge is persuasive....In support, Rybar cites, paradoxically, the Supreme Court decision in United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174 (1939), where the Court upheld the constitutionality of a firearms-registration requirement against a Second Amendment challenge. Rybar draws on that holding, relying on the Miller Court's observation that the sawed-off shotgun in question had not been shown to bear 'some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia.' Brief of Appellant at 24-25; Miller, 307 U.S. at 178. Drawing from that language the contra positive implication, Rybar suggests that because the military utility of the machine guns proscribed by Section(s) 922(o) is clear, a result contrary to that reached in Miller is required, and the statute is therefore invalid under the Second Amendment....We note first that however clear the Court's suggestion that the firearm before it lacked the necessary military character, it did not state that such character alone would be sufficient to secure Second Amendment protection. In fact, the Miller Court assigned no special importance to the character of the weapon itself, but instead demanded a reasonable relationship between its 'possession or use' and militia related activity....Rybar's invocation of this statute does nothing to establish that his firearm possession bears a reasonable relationship to 'the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia,' as required in Miller, 307 U.S. at 178. \"\n U.S. v. Rybar (3rd. Cir. 1996) \n \n \"the courts consistently have found no conflict between federal gun laws and the Second Amendment, narrowly construing the latter to guarantee the right to bear arms as a member of a militia....\" \n United States v. Graves (3rd Cir. 1977) \n \n \n \"The purpose of the second amendment as stated by the Supreme Court in United States v. Miller, supra at 178, 59 S.Ct. 816, was to preserve the effectiveness and assure the continuation of the state militia.\"\n United States v. Oakes (10th Cir. 1977)",

   "The Supreme Court refused to hear a case 2 months ago on that very subject (i.e. an individual's right to own firearms). So, the 2nd Amendment stands as is.\n \n I've forgotten the legal rmifications of this upon the cases. My recollection is that the legal when the Supreme Ct. refuses to hear a case for appealing an existing law that the decision of the lower Courts is dependent upon State Law, and that varies State by State.\n \n I put quite a bit of thought into the subject yesterday, and came up with what I believe are some well founded arguments that I would maintain unless there was a more convincing argument to make me believe otherwise.\n \n I posted my own argument in Post #5 of the thread in this Forum entitled: \"Maybe the 2nd Ammendment wasn't entirely about the british? But still!\"\n \n I'd welcome debate or your thoughts on it.\n \n Frankly speaking, while I concluded that the Founding Fathers did not provide the rights for individual ownership of guns for purposes other than a previsioin\n for a militia, I am very confused why they would not have written the 2nd Amendment in a manner that would extend the purpose and reasons for ian individual to own firearms to things that were wide-spread at that time, such as using a gun for hunting, and the profession of hunting for pelts and skins (i.e. income), as well as, for self-defense, since the situation with the Native Americans was not entirely solved at that point, and settlers could still feel uncertian, and lastly the gun culture of the West was still in existence and would remain so for many years. Also, at that time it would not have been uncommon for many households to own a gun for purposes other than a militia.\n \n I know that the Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution with great care, and skill. They chose very carefully worded phrases and sentences, as well as, a careful structure. So, that they did not expand, extend, or choose different wording in the 2nd Amendment for the Right of individuals to own funs for purposes other than a militia is VERY confusing to me, since they could not have reasonably been expected to have forseen a time at which there would be no requirement for guns for the purposes that they were used for at that time. Guns were still being invented and improved, and they would have seen quite a few new models and improvements. So, it's not reasonable for us to think that the Founding Fathers could have forgotten about gun ownership.\n \n Still, the way they worded the 2nd Amendment didn't provide a right for gun ownership to individuals.\n \n There is ONE possibility that I can think of that IS reasonable.\n \n The Founding Fathers might have taken for granted that individuals would always own guns for the purposes of hunting, and self-defense, but not for a militia.\n \n It is quite possible that they created the 2nd Amendment to specify owning guns for a militia because they would have been paraniod of an invasion at that time, but taken for granted that any government would allow people to own guns for the commonly known purposes as that time, and simply not have included that Right in the Constitution because they would have thought that it was such a common thing that they were not going to put the Right for people to do the things that should be taken for granted in the Constitution as it would have become an immense document that they would never have finished writing and revising.\n \n What do you think???",

Owning a gun then would, as you say, be like owning a car today.\n Only problemis that they have no Amendment for it.\n \n Which Amendment is used to provide a basis for us owning cars, I don't know.
