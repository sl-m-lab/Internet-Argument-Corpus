Assuming we haven't (and I don't know why that is), under what grounds do we have to claim anyone an \"illegal combatant\"?\n \n I'd agree that under the Hague standards, al-qaeda terrorists are illegal combatants (though I DONT think the same applies to Taliban fighters). However, a trial to find out if they actually ARE doesn't strike me as odd or unreasonable. Take Yasser Hamdi for example. If Govt. allegations are true, then he is unquestionably an enemy combatant. But the only support they have is hearsay evidence from the Northern Alliance fighters who caught him. Hamdi has claimed he was a humaniterean worker caught up in a sweep by NA fighters. Its entirely possible that he's just lying. But there needs to be some forum in which he can present his case.\n \n The idea is once again, that America holds itself to a higher standard. Yes, it would be FAR easier to prosecute our war on terror without all these nasty constitutional and international law restrictions (and you know what would be REALLY easy? Just nuking the middle east and ending the problem once and for all). But theoretically, we believe in some form of deontological morality which precludes us from doing that. The same standard of morality you use to justify stripping terrorists of due process could easily have been applied to communists in the 50s, blacks in the 60s, and garden variety criminal of any day and age.

Toxicology Data\n \n Acute toxicity:\n \n * Acute oral toxicity: In tests in male and female rats, the acute oral LD50 was 4320 mg/kg. (Toxicity Category III, Table I, Oral).\n \n Acute dermal toxicity: The acute dermal (skin) LD50 was equal to or greater than 794 mg/kg in female rabbits, and 5010 mg/kg in male rabbits. (Toxicity Category III, Table I, Dermal).\n * Primary irritation score: In laboratory tests in rabbits, glyphosate was not an irritant. (Toxicity Category IV, Table I, Skin irritation).\n * Primary eye irritation: In laboratory tests in rabbits, glyphosate was a mild eye irritant. (Toxicity Category III, Table I, Eye irritation).\n * Acute inhalation: The requirement for an inhalation study was waived by the Environmental Protection Agency. \n \n Chronic toxicity:\n \n * Carcinogenicity: The Environmental Protection Agency has concluded that glyphosate should be classified as a compound with evidence of non-carcinogenicity for humans. This conclusion is based on the lack of convincing carcinogenicity evidence in adequate studies in two animal species.\n * Developmental: Laboratory studies with glyphosate in pregnant rats (at dose levels up to 3500 mg/kg per day) and rabbits (at dose levels up to 350 mg/kg per day) indicated no evidence of teratology (birth defects).\n * Reproduction: A three-generation reproduction study in rats did not show any adverse effects on fertility or reproduction at doses up to 30 mg/kg per day.\n * Mutagenicity: Glyphosate was negative in all tests for mutagenicity (the ability to cause genetic damage). \n \n The data reported above are results of animal studies which the Environmental Protection Agency has evaluated in support of the registration of glyphosate. These data are used to make inferences relative to human health.\n \n HAZARD: Based on the results of animal studies, glyphosate does not cause genetic damage or birth defects, and has little or no effect on fertility, reproduction, or development of offspring. There is not enough information available at this time to determine whether glyphosate causes cancer. There have been no reported cases of long term health effects in humans due to glyphosate exposure.\n \n http://infoventures.com/e-hlth/pestcide/glyphos.html\n\n Oh, and a Category III Toxin is almost harmless.

   "There is a HUGE difference between advocating a strong response against terrorism and suggesting that we kill people without due process. HUGE difference. The first is an admirable (though apparently futile) goal, the second is gestapo tactics. No question. \nGestapo tactics go with a police state. I'm not in any way advocating as police state. I'm not in favor of killing people without due process either. The process is, we define terrorism as the use of bombs,chemicals or biological weapons, we kill those who do those things. We let everybody know the rules, then we start killing people who break them. That's the process.\n \n \n \n\n Isn't this a charming slogan?\nYes, I rather think so!\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n They knew when they started spraying it that it was harmful. When they started spraying originally, Glyphosate was considered a class II toxin. Read the label on a bottle of roundup. It does not say \"you can safely drink this stuff, bathe in it, or snort it\". It says more along the lines of \"don't touch it,. don't even think about drinking it, don't let it touch anything you want to remain alive, be it plant or animal. Keep it away from groundwater, fish, and anything else you may someday touch or eat\"\n \n You seem to be saying that it is OK to dump toxic chemicals on people as long as your primary objective is not to kill the people, it is just an unfortunate side effect. By your logic, BL could get on TV tomorrow and say \"I didn't mean for anybody to die, I just wanted to hurt the building, not the people, they were unfortunate, but not my primary objective\", and, again by your logic, we should all say \"OK\" and let it go.\nYou seem to like to twist what I say into something you wish I'd said. I never said it was okay to dump chemicals on people at all.\n \n Notwithstanding all the things that have been called \"terrorism\" in the past, let's redefine it and start punishing (by death) those who participate.",

Or is the foregin trained, foregin supplied, and foregin paid military the legal one?\nThat is a good subject for another thread.

I am trying to lay out ways by which the extreme penalty (death) could be fairly applied to terrorists. This requires clarification of the recognized types of terrorist actions.

It is nothing more than an empty statement.\n\n \n No country has turned into a democracy without building up from the ground. Every Democracy has always come from the ground up. Democracy by mere definition is rule by the mob. Force feeding democracy from the top is antithetical to the notion of democracy. Even in countries were we placed democracy from the top are have serious issues with the notion itself: Example: Kosovo. Democracy must come from the ground up, just like a house.

It's the one consistency in an otherwise inconsistent US Foreign Policy.\n\n \n And you prove my point. The US only supports democracy if it's rulers are pro-US. Replace Commie with Stalinist/Leninist. Communism hasn't been tried, the key aspects of Marxist society haven't been implemnted anywhere on this planet except for perhaps a few nomadic socities in Africa and a few indian communities in the Andes (which work rather well).

You gave a example of where the US showed distain for democracy because of it's elected leaders. The people in Iraq are likely to elect a adamently anti-US leader, which the US will not allow.

Iraq would never have had the ability to do so on its own. Saddam ruled Iraq with an iron fist and many death squads that squashed any thoughts of freeing themselves from his rule. I think that you need to go back and evaluate just who is making \"wild claims and not backing them up.\"\n\n \n Who's the one who doesn't know anything about history? oh wait, it's you. If Iraq becomes a democracy, it will likely be a form of plutocracy mixed cronism, which is far from the ideas Bush says he wants in Iraq, but reflective of the current US system. If Iraq is to become a real democracy, it will do so on it's own. You apparently think that building a house from the top down will work. \n \n \n\n Every assertion that you made in your post was your opinion, an opinion that has no factual basis.\n\n \n Um...do you understand the history of democracy and how it was applied? You apparently think that building a house from the top down will work. Democracy is not a magic pill that a forgin power can give to a few unelected leaders and bam, democracy comes about. Democracy must be a homegrown notion that arises from the majority of the population that rises to the top of society. It cannot be a trickle down notion as you intend it to be. \n \n \nYou don't know if we can force a democracy in the ME because it hasn't been tried before.\n\n \n We tried forcing democracy in the Balklans. Russia tried forcing democracy in Chenenya. We tried forcing democracy in certain Latin American countries. Each of these examples has major issues with its governmental structures, all of them are unstable, and several that are looking to be complete frauds. \n \n \nYou think that we can't guide the creation of one, which is exactly what we are doing now.\n\n \n Which is....treating them like 2nd class citizens? \n \n \n\n Time will tell, but my money is on success. Want to take me up on that bet?\n\n \n Depends who are the next 3 presidents. Bush's approach isn't working because it is antithetical to the notions of democracy.",

   "ok, jpsarte, thanks for responding\n No problem\n 1. is this war intended to reduce the threat of terrorism to america? Yes\n we agree\n \n 2. is this war in response to the tragedy of 9/11? Not entirely, but it did get a push from it.\n so if this war wasnt in response to 9/11, what caused it? It was caused by continual violations of the cease-fire agreement and failure to demonstrate compliance with UN weapons inspections\n \n 3. is this war intended to bring the perpetrators of the 9/11 crimes to justice? No\n so should we let people that murder thousands of americans go free without penalty? Absolutely not, and I think that extends to Saudi Arabia\n \n 4. what would be the ideal response to an al qaeda attack on america? Nuke 'em until they glow\n i agree, but we arent nuking any al qaedas. we arent even pursuing them. besides, you just said this war isnt about bringing the al qaeda to justice (question 3) You asked what we should do to AQ, not to end the war. I responded to the question asked. \n \n 5. what should be the primary goal of this war (not broad vision, specific goal)? End Saddam's rule and oversee the establishment of an Iraqi-ruled democracy\n what does ending saddam's rule and democracy in iraq have to do with reducing the threat of terrorism in america (question 1)?\n Saddam was a threat to international stability and safe harbor for more than one terrorist organization. If you recall, the mastermind behind the Achilles Largo attack was caught in Iraq, for example.\n \n 6. what is being done to accomplish this goal? Supporting the transition of rule from US to Iraqis and getting ready for elections.\n agreed, this satisfies your answer to question 5, but that doesnt mesh with your answer in question 1\n There are many things that we are doing to reduce the threat to America. Military actions in Iraq and Afghanistan are but two of them. In total, I'd guess that there are hundreds or thousands of activities taking place in an effort to thwart terrorists worldwide as I write this.\n \n could you just clarify why your answers contradict each other?\n\n See above. No contradiction, just answers to the questions asked, not the ones not asked. \n emoticon_confused",

You don't bring to an end the rule of a dictator, whom has been in power for so long, and then expect immediate stability. That is absurd. \n \n \nNewsweek and TIME have articles every edition that highlights that Iraqi are grateful we kicked out Saddam, but do not want us to remain. It's not my fault you don't read those. \n \n \n Ok. What the Iraqis might not understand is that you can't just remove the head of the beast. The coalition needs to bring stability to the nation before they leave. The worst possible move would be to pull out now, and let warring factions fight for control of the country through military conquest. Infrastructure needs to be put in place for the country to be successful. This thought that a stable government can come to fruition overnight is false.\n \n \nPossibly, but that usually comes from sites that ignore everything bad in Iraq, and praise Bush like a God.\n \n \n I disagree without reservation. The media, at least in Australia, shows an extremely heavy bias to reporting on Iraq only when there is an explosion, or a soldier dies. Almost never do we see smiling citizens, or those that are happy in the country. Why is this? It's sad, but its because the powers that be don't think that the public would particularly care for such information, as public opinion concerning the war in Iraq is that it is a dirty war. The media is just going with the flow to please the ignorant masses, so all that the ignorant masses see is people dying which strengthens their arguement that this war is wrong.

They don't go there because there is a good chance they will be shot/mugged/robbed/murdered/stabbed/ so on and so forth. \n \n \n\n You are  a double standard.\n\n \n By not supporting your law anywhere or the sentiments behind it? How does that make me a double standard? Applying the same judgement towards everyone for all sentiments is not a double standard. \n \n \n\n As I previously stated in a qualified manner, the use of bombs should bring the death penalty. Rifles and pistols are okay. It is far more selective to put a bullet through the brain of the targeted individual than it is to blast the surrounding people away along with him.\n\n \n Would you have executed the officer who placed a bomb in Hitler's bunker during the conference of his high ranking offers?",

He offered money to the families of suicide bombers, for example. He allowed terrorists to train, receive medical attention and live in Iraq unmolested and he was, himself, a terrorist.\n \n\n do you have any links or reports? and be sure to show that its actually OUR troops involved in these activities. i say that because ive read many reports of the pakistanis and the saudis fighting terrorists, but never with the us involvement\n\n As I stated earlier, I happened to be listening to an interview with a gemologist who was in the Pakistan/Afghanistan region hunting for gems. He just returned a week or so ago and said he was within 20 miles of the action and mentioned that US troops were in Afghanistan waiting for AQ members to be flushed out by Pakistani troops on the other side of the border. \n I did find this:\n \n\n Doha: A senior US Central Command official yesterday said that Saudi dissident and head of the Al Qaeda terror network, Osama bin Laden, was hiding in the Federally Administered Tribal Area (Fata) of Pakistan along the Afghan border and it was only a matter of time before he was nabbed or killed in military operations. \n \n Speaking to reporters at Camp Assailiyah near Doha, Lieutenant General Lance L Smith, who is the second in command of the Centcom said: \"He is hiding in a sovereign country, Pakistan, where we have no freedom of movement. We have to rely on the Pakistani military to go after them. President Pervez Musharraf is doing a good job and we hope that the Pakistani operations will cause movement, which it already has, that will give them the opportunity to catch Bin Laden, Ayman Al Zawahiri and other senior Al Qaeda leaders,\" he added. \n \n http://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/Display_news.asp?section=Local%5FNews&subsection=Qatar+News&month=September2004&file=Local_News2004090524849.xml\n",
