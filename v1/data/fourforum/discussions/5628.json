   "More Islamic justice (AKA \"the religion of peace.\") Don't look at the photos of it being done if you're squeamish.\n ===========================\n \n Iran: Man sentenced to have eyes gouged out for teenage crime\n \n IranFocus ^ | June 10, 2005 | IranFocus\n \n Tehran, Jun. 10 - Iran's State Supreme Court has upheld a sentence for a young man's eyes to be gouged out and sprayed with acid, for blinding another man at the age of 16 some 12 years ago. The defendant, only identified by his first name Vahid, was convicted of deliberately pouring acid on the face of another individual by the name of Gholam-Hossein while he worked as a labourer in Tehran when he was 16 years old, though he maintained throughout the trial that the attack was not intentional and that he had only meant to threaten the man...\n \n (Snip)\n \n A second court rejected the appeal and instead ordered for Vahid's eyes to be first gouged out by a \"qualified surgeon\" and then sprayed with acid \"so as not to damage the face itself\"... (Aren't they kind?\")\n \n (Snip)\n \n http://www.iranfocus.com/uploads/img42a98faab088e.jpg\n \n http://www.iranfocus.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=2345",
