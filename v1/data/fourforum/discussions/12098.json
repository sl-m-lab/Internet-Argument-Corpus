   "The preachers of your God told you to vote for George W. Bush and all Republicans. They and your God have betrayed you.\n \n Now we are on the verge of a national depression, if we are not in an actual depression and I blame the fools who worshiped a false god.\n \nDecember 14, 2008\n Bad Times Draw Bigger Crowds to Churches\n By PAUL VITELLO\n The sudden crush of worshipers packing the small evangelical Shelter Rock Church in Manhasset, N.Y. - a Long Island hamlet of yacht clubs and hedge fund managers - forced the pastor to set up an overflow room with closed-circuit TV and 100 folding chairs, which have been filled for six Sundays straight.\n \n In Seattle, the Mars Hill Church, one of the fastest-growing evangelical churches in the country, grew to 7,000 members this fall, up 1,000 in a year. At the Life Christian Church in West Orange, N.J., prayer requests have doubled - almost all of them aimed at getting or keeping jobs.\n \n http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/14/nyregion/14churches.html\n \n As you head off to the soup kitchens and the breadlines, are you willing to forswear your foolishness?\n \n God and politics should never mix. You will be led astray when you listen to preachers who tell you what candidates to vote for, how you should vote on issues.\n \n Perhaps, if you cannot think for yourselves, it is no wonder you are jobless.",

Only you could surmise from this article that these people are concerned about ending up in breadlines and soup kitchens. Beside the fact that once again the premise of the thread is false since even if we accepted your propaganda as factual, it wasn't God who led anyone astray. \n \n I must compliment you though as a good soldier for the powers of spiritual darkness as you so faithfully attack God and spiritual enlightenment at every given opportunity. emoticon_xdonno",

   "Simone,\n What these preachers say and what God says are not necessarily the same thing.\n\n I second that.\n \n One interesting thing to note about the bible is what JESUS HIMSELF STATES that his followers will be able to do.\n Like healing the sick with the power of their faith.\n \n Yet if you look around Christianity today, \"faith healing\" is virtually non-existent.\n Those that exist are typically looked on as charlatans, and their followers perceived to be naive and gullible.\n \n And faith healing, documented proof, just plain doesn't exist.\n That would lead a \"true believer\" to either realize that the church IS NOT following Jesus....\n But rather than harsh the religious buzz, let me end here and let people return to their religious TV shows with multi-million dollar sets that ask for money to help the \"preachers\" fund their extravagent houses based on the donations of their millions of followers.\n \n (And before somebody jumps in with non-sequiturs, I AM NOT claiming all churches are like that. Nowhere near most.\n But the NUMBER OF FOLLOWERS who endorse such occurrences with donations is amazing...)",
