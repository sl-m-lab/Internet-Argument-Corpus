   "http://www.gao.gov/financial/fy2007/07frusg.pdf\n \n Like normal no one cares but lets take a look at some findings:\n \n 1) Homeland security and DoD have disclaimer of opinion (for those that don't know it means they failed at doing their accounting correctly). \n \n 2) Our deficit went down from -450billion to -275billion ....whoop-de-do\n \n 3) Health and Human Services is now the top cost.\n \n \nWhile significant progress has been made in improving financial management since the U.S. government began preparing consolidated financial statements 11 years ago, three major impediments continue to prevent us from rendering an opinion on the accrual basis consolidated financial statements: (1) serious financial management problems at the Department of Defense, (2) the federal government's inability to adequately account for and reconcile intragovernmental activity and balances between federal agencies, and (3) the federal government's ineffective process for preparing the consolidated financial statements. Until the problems outlined in our audit report are adequately addressed, they will continue to have adverse implications for the federal government and American taxpayers.\n",

Perhaps I'm biased but economist loss to accountants every time :)\n\n \n A lot of those economic theories they are working under they are jsut making up as they go along. Most of the others are incomplete adaptations of old, proven theories. The Laffer curve, which actually predated laffer by about 1000 years is a good example. BAsically the theory there is that there is a point of equilibrium where increased taxation decreases government revenue because the high tax level chokes off the economy. Obviously under the theory of taxable income elasticity (the proper name for the laffer curve) if taxes are so high as to stifle the economy, reducing them will lead to economic growth.\n \n Sadly Reagan read that and jsut saw \"tax reductions lead to economic growth\", which he parroted to the american people. Sadly many of them still don't realize that there are conditions to the \"tax reduction/economic growth\" paradigm.\n \n I don't have a problem with the application of sound economic theory. The problem always seems to come when they try to apply poorly understood economic theory, or just make up their own as they go. \n \n There is no accepted economic theory that says you can live in constant deficit and it will not come back and bite you on the butt later. That is another \"half theory\". The actually theory is that during times of rapid economic expansion, deficit spending does not hurt you because the dividends from the economic growth will allow you to easily repay that debt. Somehow this has been translated to \"deficits don't matter\". Stupidity stacked on top of stupidity.\n \n What people do not seem to realize is that most economic theories are not as complicated as they have been led to believe. For the most part, if it will not work for your checking account, it probably won't work anywhere else.",

It is important to understand that the reason for taxing is not just to sustain an economy or have a sound economic theory. You use taxation to generate revenue for social needs obviously and you can use it to influence behavior that is desired such as promoting giving. So you never make tax rules to make logical sense with the economy totally but we can at least go back to rule 1 which is only spend what you have.",

So you never make tax rules to make logical sense with the economy totally but we can at least go back to rule 1 which is only spend what you have.\n\n \n There are 2 parts to economic theory. There is the \"what happens\" portion, which is the simple part. Then there is the \"why it happens\". The second part is the part that gets complex with opposing theories. The \"why\" portion is pretty much just mental masterbation anyway, so for all practical purposes you can ignore it.\n \n The \"what\" is important and is typically well established. IF you consistently spend more than you make, you will eventually go broke. That is pretty simple and anybody who has ever held $1 in their hand and lusted after something that cost $1.25 should understand it. Where things get tricky is when people try to interject the results fo their mental masturbation in the \"why\" category to the \"what\". Then you get all kinds of idiotic explanations for why the \"what\" is going to be different this time when, in fact, the \"what\" is a constant. It does not actually change.",
