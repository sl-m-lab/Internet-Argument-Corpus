   "I'm very disgusted to see you here and commenting on these events unfolding Galileo, but I'm certainly not surprised that you chose to make an appearance.\n \n Now that the pleasantries are aside, let's get to the issue.\n \n \n\"But you do not hear much about the fact that Jared Loughner came to Giffords&#8217;s sweet gathering with a semiautomatic weapon that he was able to buy legally because the law restricting their sale expired in 2004 and Congress did not have the guts to face up to the National Rifle Association and extend it.\n\n \n And already we're onto one of the first of many lies. The gun in question, a Glock Model 19 pistol, was never restricted from sale between 1994 and 2004. Neither it nor any other model of Glock pistol was ever on the list of so-called \"assault weapons\" during the time the first law was enacted.\n \n Here we have the text of the \"Assault Weapons Ban of 1994\" and what it lists as examples of what would qualify as \"assault weapons\" under the law.\n \n http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/F?c103:1:./temp/~c103Ac9PWB:e643945:\n \n For ease of reading I've only included the sections that deal specifically with handguns covered, and the names of specific brands.\n \n `(A) any of the firearms, or copies or duplicates of the firearms in any caliber, known as--\n \n `(i) Norinco, Mitchell, and Poly Technologies Avtomat Kalashnikovs (all models);\n \n `(ii) Action Arms Israeli Military Industries UZI and Galil;\n \n `(iii) Beretta Ar70 (SC-70);\n \n `(iv) Colt AR-15;\n \n `(v) Fabrique National FN/FAL, FN/LAR, and FNC;\n \n `(vi) SWD M-10, M-11, M-11/9, and M-12;\n \n `(vii) Steyr AUG;\n \n `(viii) INTRATEC TEC-9, TEC-DC9 and TEC-22; and\n \n `(ix) revolving cylinder shotguns, such as (or similar to) the Street Sweeper and Striker 12;\n \n Note how Glock isn't even mentioned once.\n \n `(C) a semiautomatic pistol that has an ability to accept a detachable magazine and has at least 2 of--\n \n `(i) an ammunition magazine that attaches to the pistol outside of the pistol grip;\n \n `(ii) a threaded barrel capable of accepting a barrel extender, flash suppressor, forward handgrip, or silencer;\n \n `(iii) a shroud that is attached to, or partially or completely encircles, the barrel and that permits the shooter to hold the firearm with the nontrigger hand without being burned;\n \n `(iv) a manufactured weight of 50 ounces or more when the pistol is unloaded; and\n \n `(v) a semiautomatic version of an automatic firearm;\n \n Again, note how there's nothing to suggest the Glock series of pistols qualifies under the law.\n \n \n\"If Loughner had gone to the Safeway carrying a regular pistol, the kind most Americans think of when they think of the right to bear arms, Giffords would probably still have been shot and we would still be having that conversation about whether it was a sane idea to put her Congressional district in the cross hairs of a rifle on the Internet.\n\n \n Exactly what is a \"regular pistol\" in this case? What amounts to \"the kind most Americans think of when they think of the right to bear arms?\" How exactly does the Glock series differ from, say, a 1911 pistol, or a Beretta 92, or any other kind of gun that has origins dating back to the early 1900s? What makes the Glock in question so irregular, and how is that even relevant?\n \n If Paul Helmke is referring to the double action revolver as a \"regular pistol\" then I'm sorry but he's completely wrong. The semi-automatic pistol has been around as a successful design since 1896 when the Mauser C96 was first introduced. It's nearly as old a design as the double action revolver with the swing out cylinder. They were practically raised together, so there's no ground for suggesting that semi-automatics are somehow irregular pistols.\n \n The Glock series of pistols is very widespread. So widespread in fact that it's the standard issue duty sidearm of many police divisions. That hardly sounds like something that's irregular in nature. Here is a list of the various users of the Glock series of pistols, just to show how common it is. http://www.answers.com/topic/glock-pistol#Users\n \n \n\"Loughner&#8217;s gun, a 9-millimeter Glock, is extremely easy to fire over and over, and it can carry a 30-bullet clip. It is 'not suited for hunting or personal protection,' said Paul Helmke, the president of the Brady Campaign. 'What it&#8217;s good for is killing and injuring a lot of people quickly.' \" \n http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/10/opinion/10collins.html\n\n \n Firstly, the Glock series doesn't have a market exclusive with the ability to take magazines that hold 30 rounds of ammunition. 30+ round magazines are very common for all variety of handguns. The list is so extensive there's no way to show all the different models capable of doing this. There's Taurus, the 1911, Beretta, Sig-Sauer, Smith & Wesson, Ruger, Kel-Tec, etc.\n \n Also note that early reports said that Loughner had four magazines in his possession at the time of the shooting, indicating that he fully planned on switching between magazines to continue shooting when one ran dry. That would suggest to a normal person that he planned on committing mayhem and murder regardless of physical limitations.\n \n Secondly, the ease of which a weapon can be fired is completely irrelevant to the subject at hand. One could easily argue that the ease of which a weapon can be fired would aid to its usefulness as a defensive tool, rather than detracting from it.\n \n And third, Paul Helmke is showing his ignorance by claiming that the Glock series of firearm isn't suited for personal protection. He offers absolutely no evidence to support his claim that the Glock series of pistols isn't suited for personal protection, he simply says that it isn't and leaves it as that. He does nothing to explain how it's lightweight construction, ease of handling, simple design, reliable nature, and chambering in known effective calibers, somehow make it unsuited for personal protection, while other models of similar performance would easily be considered suited for such tasks.\n \n There is one slight sliver of truth in Paul Helmke's statement though. The Glock series of pistols isn't really suited for hunting purposes, mainly because it's not chambered for cartridges that have a reputation for reliably bringing down large and dangerous animals. But that's about the extent of the truth, everything else is an outright lie.\n \n \nIs it disturbing that someone like Loughner can just walk into a gun store and buy such a weapon because Congress was pressured by the NRA into letting the assault weapons ban expire?\n\n \n Was Loughner ever officially committed for mental illness in a court of law, where decisions carry actual legal weight? If not then why not?\n \n Let's assume for a moment that Loughner really was committed in a court of law and that record existed somewhere. Even if this happened that wouldn't be sufficient unless his record of commitment was made available for the NICS background check system. If it wasn't then it's an issue of misconduct on the part of judges and politicians and other public officials, not individual citizens who often face the backlash of various laws.\n \n Even if Loughner's record had been submitted and he was denied the purchase in the first place, there's nothing that would have stopped him from convincing someone to make a straw purchase for him, thus bypassing the background check system entirely. I believe I've covered this shortcoming in gun control logic in previous threads. And if such had happened then things would've happened just as they had, the only difference being the gun would be reported as lost or stolen by the \"rightful\" owner who did the straw purchase.",

As with all of the other Glock pistols, the Glock 19 is very accurate and reliable. The Glock 19 is a compact 9 mm gun used by many cops. \n \n The Glock 19 is a compact version of the Glock 17. The Glock 19 is slightly larger than the 9mm subcompact Glock 26. Glock first started producing the Glock 19 in 1988 and was designed specifically for police officers and military. While being smaller than the Glock 17, the Glock 19 still holds up to 15 rounds. Many police officers with smaller hands will carry the Glock 19 as their duty weapon because it is easier for them to grip the gun. \n\n Just imagine what the Antis would be saying if it were a full sized Glock! \n \n Why he had an atomic weapon!\n \n Let's instead imagine a world where so called loving and caring Liberals were to actually do something to help these individuals instead of waiting to dance in the blood of the senseless tragedy they cause. \n \n Come on!

No two ways about it.\n \n If you're going to quote someone to try and make a point, fact checking would be very helpful.\n \n \nBut didn't the AWB also place restrictions on high capacity magazines?\n\n \n No not really. I'll quote the section to show you why. Bill Text - 103rd Congress (1993-1994) - THOMAS (Library of Congress)\n \n (a) PROHIBITION- Section 922 of title 18, United States Code, as amended by section 110102(a), is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n \n `(w)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), it shall be unlawful for a person to transfer or possess a large capacity ammunition feeding device.\n \n `(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the possession or transfer of any large capacity ammunition feeding device otherwise lawfully possessed on or before the date of the enactment of this subsection.\n \n It says right there that the law didn't apply to previously manufactured and possessed magazines that would legally be recognized as \"high capacity\" in nature. That means Loughner could have found and purchased a pre-ban magazine of whatever size he wanted, it just would've been expensive to do. But it still would've been fully legal and he couldn't be charged with having violated any laws.\n \n There's also the fact that magazines, unlike the main firearms they're designed to work with, don't include serial numbers to show when they were made, making it extremely difficult or impossible to prove whether it was made before or after the specified date in 1994.\n \n \n\"The high-capacity magazine of the semiautomatic pistol used in the shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and more than a dozen other people on Saturday would have been illegal to manufacture and difficult to purchase under the Clinton-era assault weapons ban, which expired in 2004.\"\n Weapon in rampage was banned under Clinton-era law - War Room - Salon.com\n\n \n Difficult but not impossible. That means that even if the ban on so-called \"assault weapons\" was still in place today, it would still have been entirely possible for Loughner to acquire said magazine and use it just as he did.\n \n Even if Loughner hadn't been able to acquire a defined \"high capacity magazine\" that wouldn't have made much impact on the situation. Had he been limited to ten rounds per magazine he still would have been able to shoot Griffords in the head, kill the federal judge, kill the nine year old girl, and still wound and/or kill several more people before he was tackled by the crowd. Fewer people would have been injured (in theory at least) but there's absolutely no reason to believe that any fewer victims would have died as a result.",

So high capacity magazines aren't a problem unless the shooter can aim?\n\n \n There are varying reports about how many rounds were fired. Early reports indicated that only 20 rounds were fired from a 30 round magazine, others suggested he was already switching magazines by the time he was tackled by several brave spectators who wrestled him to the ground. The full set of facts still aren't available yet to say just what the truth is.\n \n What we do know for a fact is that out of all the rounds fired, 20 people were injured. Of those only six are known to have died.

Early reports indicated that only 20 rounds were fired from a 30 round magazine, others suggested he was already switching magazines by the time he was tackled by several brave spectators who wrestled him to the ground. The full set of facts still aren't available yet to say just what the truth is.\n \n What we do know for a fact is that out of all the rounds fired, 20 people were injured. Of those only six are known to have died. We don't know the order in which these six dead were shot, whether they were the first to be hit after Giffords were shot, or if there was no particular pattern to the shooting.\n \n The point however is that only six people were killed. And while that's small consolation there's no reason to believe that the death toll would have been lower had the ban on the sale and manufacture of new \"high capacity magazines\" was still in effect. I simply see no reason to assume that the death toll would have somehow been lower than what we witnessed on Saturday. Maybe the number of injured would be lower, but the number of dead likely wouldn't have been.\n \n Regardless of what might or might not have happened had certain materials and accessories not been available at the time, Giffords would still be shot in the head, and the federal judge and nine year old girl would still be dead. And they're the one who are the high profile victims right now.\nHe was tackled while reloading. Doesn't that suggest that his 31 rounds were exhausted? The fact that those potentially shot with rounds 11-31 didn't die doesn't mean the high capacity magazines played no significant role.",

   "The NRA has been claiming for years that the AWB was all about cosmetics. I'd be interested to hear an explanation of how the high capacity magazine used in this incident only changed the appearance of the glock and nothing else.\n\n \n The magazine is a completely separate component, both in physical terms in relation to the gun itself, and under the so-called \"assault weapons ban\" of 1994. If you look at the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 you'll see that the ban on \"assault weapons\" and the ban on \"high capacity magazines\" are two separate provisions of the overall law.\n \n And yes, despite what you might try to claim, the ban on so-called \"assault weapons\" was purely about cosmetic features, not physical differences. If the ban on \"assault weapons\" were only about function and overall design then I really don't see how those who wrote the bill could determine that some semi-automatics were considered \"safe\" to be owned, while others were \"unsafe\" to own and had to be restricted. Logically there's absolutely no sense to this argument.\n \n Mentioned features used for determining whether a firearm qualified as an \"assault weapon\" are as follows:\n \n `(B) a semiautomatic rifle that has an ability to accept a detachable magazine and has at least 2 of--\n \n `(i) a folding or telescoping stock;\n \n `(ii) a pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon;\n \n `(iii) a bayonet mount;\n \n `(iv) a flash suppressor or threaded barrel designed to accommodate a flash suppressor; and\n \n `(v) a grenade launcher;\n \n `(C) a semiautomatic pistol that has an ability to accept a detachable magazine and has at least 2 of--\n \n `(i) an ammunition magazine that attaches to the pistol outside of the pistol grip;\n \n `(ii) a threaded barrel capable of accepting a barrel extender, flash suppressor, forward handgrip, or silencer;\n \n `(iii) a shroud that is attached to, or partially or completely encircles, the barrel and that permits the shooter to hold the firearm with the nontrigger hand without being burned;\n \n `(iv) a manufactured weight of 50 ounces or more when the pistol is unloaded; and\n \n `(v) a semiautomatic version of an automatic firearm; and\n \n `(D) a semiautomatic shotgun that has at least 2 of--\n \n `(i) a folding or telescoping stock;\n \n `(ii) a pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon;\n \n `(iii) a fixed magazine capacity in excess of 5 rounds; and\n \n `(iv) an ability to accept a detachable magazine.'.\n \n All of these features, such as the adjustable stock, the pistol grip, the threaded muzzle, the flash suppressor, the bayonet lug, etc. these are all features that are purely cosmetic and neither add nor detract from the overall function of the gun in question. Regardless of what might be claimed, none of these features make the weapon anymore concealable (either when firing at night or when trying to hide under a coat), anymore controllable during rapid fire, anymore deadly, etc. they do none of that.\n \n I have seen many attempts by the gun control crowd on multiple websites to try and demonize these features, trying to paint them as some sort of lethality enhancers that can make a bullet deadlier than it would be from any other firearm of the same chambering and caliber. But what it all boils down to is bunk. It's nothing more than a scare tactic designed to prey on those who lack knowledge.\n \n Keep in mind that the Glock series of pistols have absolutely none of these features. It was never covered by the \"assault weapons ban\" of 1994. It was never prohibited from civilian ownership.\n \n All of this is irrelevant to a simple fact of reality: a gun is a deadly weapon. It's designed from the very beginning to be deadly in nature. There's no way one can successfully make it into anything else. It's not a non-lethal option. It's not politically correct in nature. The magazine itself plays absolutely no part in affecting this simple fact. The Glock in question was made no more deadly than it would've been if Loughner had been limited to only 10 round magazines (which he wouldn't have because they were never truly banned to begin with. There was no law stopping him from either buying or owning them.)\n \n A simple question really. Did the existence of the 30+ round magazine somehow give the 9mm rounds more velocity and better penetration qualities? Did the magazine improve ballistics to the point that they would be capable of defeating Kevlar vests should such be encountered? Did the magazine somehow make the diminutive 9mm round into a 100 percent lethal destroyer to all that was unfortunate enough to cross it's path?\n \n Of course the answer in these cases is a simple no. No magical qualities were bestowed upon the bullets thanks to the presence of this simple accessory. Therefore said magazine accessory makes no difference in what took place.",

Twenty-five fully loaded magazines of varying sizes were also seized.\n \n However, inner-city sources say firearms are offered for rent and ammunition sold by thugs operating in the area.

Maybe we don't have a need for them, but you haven't been able to show that we have no purpose owning them in the first place.\n \n The only response ever given is that criminals use them. That's not even a proper answer. Criminals use everything whether it's legal or not. They'll use whatever they can get their hands on. Simply because a criminal uses something for illegal activity isn't grounds for taking it away from us.\n \n Should I provide a list of the various things that have been misused by criminals for illegal purposes? If we applied the logic of gun control to other items that are frequently abused and used for the purpose of crime, there would be a great many things that should be either banned or tightly restricted.\n \n Now I'm going to cite a portion of the federal level \"assault weapons ban\" of 1994. Follow me. Bill Text - 103rd Congress (1993-1994) - THOMAS (Library of Congress)\n \n (a) PROHIBITION- Section 922 of title 18, United States Code, as amended by section 110102(a), is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n \n `(w)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), it shall be unlawful for a person to transfer or possess a large capacity ammunition feeding device.\n \n `(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the possession or transfer of any large capacity ammunition feeding device otherwise lawfully possessed on or before the date of the enactment of this subsection.\n \n `(3) This subsection shall not apply to--\n \n `(A) the manufacture for, transfer to, or possession by the United States or a department or agency of the United States or a State or a department, agency, or political subdivision of a State, or a transfer to or possession by a law enforcement officer employed by such an entity for purposes of law enforcement (whether on or off duty);\n \n The law specifically states that the prohibition on the manufacture and sale of \"high capacity magazines\" doesn't apply to those made and sold to groups like the military and police. That fact suggests there is some legitimate purpose for ownership of them, and that their existence benefits more than just criminals.\n \n Now one has to ask an obvious question. How is it that the police who come to the rescue have need for these accessories, but those of us that need to be rescued have no such need for them?\n \n In comparison that would be like saying the fire department has a need for fire extinguishers because they fight fires, but not the homeowner who's residence could catch on fire.",

   "I never said a 30 round magazine is unsuitable for personal defense. I'm quite sure it is. So is a full-auto uzi.\n\n \n I never specifically stated that the question was for you to answer. I left it open to everyone.\n \n I'm also not sure how the uzi works into this topic since we weren't discussing machine guns.\n \n \nThe question is whether having them commonly available presents an unacceptable risk of abuse.\n\n \n What exactly is an \"unacceptable risk of abuse\" and how is it defined? How many criminal actions are necessary before the amount is considered unacceptable? I feel that's something we need to clarify before I answer any further.\n \n \nThe recent shooting in AZ suggests that the consequences of their renewed availability in gun shops are real.\n\n \n They were never unavailable to begin with. If you'd like I can cite the section of the law to show that the sale and ownership of pre-1994 magazines was never restricted, meaning that they were always available to anybody who wanted one.\n \n \nDo you have a comparable story where Harvey Homeowner was saved by the fact that he had 30 rounds?\n\n \n Not on hand. But as I've said not all rounds are always fired in a defensive situation.\n \n And now onto the other points in the previous post that I didn't have the time to get to.\n \n \nI don't think it safe to assume that at all. Maybe his extra clips were the ones that come with a new handgun.\n\n \n I really don't believe that's the case. 30 round magazines are common with the sale of rifles, but with most handguns that use magazines the capacity varies between 6 for the small pocket pistols, and 17 for the full sized sidearms suitable for duty use in any police department. 30 round magazines aren't usually sold with the gun at the point of sale due to the fact that they don't fit flush with the bottom of the grip.\n \n That might be splitting hairs but it's a fact.\n \n \nSo we are in agreement that the first 30 round clip worked perfectly despite any claims of their unreliability.\n\n \n I really don't think there's any weight to this issue. One magazine worked, another didn't. There's no guarantee of functionality with any mechanical device.\n \n \nUnless it was a 10 round mag that failed. Ever known a 10 round clip to have a spring failure?\n\n \n As I said, any mechanical construct is capable of failing. But the news reports made no mention of him having 10 round magazines.\n \n \nGot a good self-defense story where the perp was finally hit with the 30th round?\n\n \n I don't believe this is relevant to the question I first asked. \n \n Do you believe that a deadly weapon can be somehow made \"less deadly\" in nature, recognized as \"less deadly\" in a court of law, and yet somehow still be effective for defensive purposes where deadly force might be necessary?\n \n \nOnly if we play along with your strawman.\n\n \n Strawman? I don't believe there's a strawman since this is a fact of the law. Under the guidelines of the 1994 law any magazine that held more than 10 rounds, even if it was just one more round, was deemed \"high capacity\" in nature and the sale of new models was restricted to law enforcement and military customers only. Under the law the people were basically told that even one round extra is too much to allow and makes the magazine prohibited for sale. That's a simple fact.\n \n \nBad guys feel the same way about getting the job done. That's the point.\n\n \n Criminals have been known to use magazines with far limited capacity for the sake of concealability. Would you like me to cite some stories about the criminal proliferation of so-called \"saturday night specials\" and then show that such models tend to hold only 6 or 7 rounds of ammunition in their magazine?\n \n \nI'd go with mines in the yard.\n\n \n I've shown seriousness in this discussion. Is it too much to ask to receive seriousness in return?",

   "Is not an uzi suitable for personal protection but heavily regulated owing to the risk of abuse?\n\n \n Yes on the first part, no on the second part. The compact nature of the uzi brand of firearms does make them well suited for a personal defense weapon. However they aren't heavily regulated due to risk of abuse. Uzi firearms, the true uzis rather than their civilian clones, are regulated because congress drew up legislation to control specific firearms with specific operation features, like the ability to fire multiple rounds with one pull of the trigger. This was a taxing scheme designed to charge people a fee for exercising their rights in a specific manner, rather than letting them do so for free.\n \n At least that's my take on it.\n \n And this still isn't the right thread for a discussion about machine guns.\n \n \nSo clarify. Why not full autos for everyone? Why not bazookas? Never know in a \"home invasion\" situation. They might have full body armor.\n\n \n I don't believe that sarcasm is a suitable tool for a serious debate. If you're genuinely interested in the discussion then I'll give it. But it would be nice for a serious response to be given in return.\n \n \nSo continued manufacture of more and more of them means nothing with respect to availability?\n\n \n While continued manufacture does mean continued availability, continued manufacture isn't a requirement for continued availability to be possible. There are a number of guns and parts that are no longer being made, but they can still be found for sale in the hands of previous owners who are looking to sell them.\n \n Simply because something stopped being made and sold by the factory, doesn't mean that it can no longer be found; especially if the market was flooded with excess amounts in the year leading up to the enactment of the legislation.\n \n \nHow many times are 20+ rounds fired in a home defense scenario? Who cares how many rounds go unfired?\n\n \n I'm not an expert on instances of home and personal defense, or how many times a magazine is emptied of its contents in a run of the mill violent encounter. I never claimed that I was.\n \n \nSo you contend that the AZ shooter bought the magazines elsewhere? What if it turns out he bought them at the same time as the handgun?\n\n \n I never said that he bought the magazines elsewhere. I merely pointed out that the 30+ round magazines aren't standard equipment in the sale of a handgun.\n \n As I said it might be splitting hairs, but it's a fact.\n \n \nCould you provide the legal definition of \"less deadly\"? Last time I was on a jury the judge was very clear that shooting at someone was always attempted murder unless you killed them.\n\n \n No I'm afraid that I can't provide a legally recognizable definition of \"less deadly\". Nor can anyone offer a an explanation for how a deadly weapon could be made \"deadlier than normal\" through the addition of a different type of magazine. That was the point; a deadly weapon can only be a deadly weapon and nothing else, regardless of what is done to it. Smaller magazines don't make it less deadly, larger magazines don't make it more deadly.\n \n \nPlease provide the text of the law stating that 10 round magazines are \"less deadly\".\n\n \n I'm afraid I can't do that since no text states this. However the law made it clear that any magazine capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition was prohibited from being made available for civilian sale between 1994 and 2004.\n \n So the question behind it all remains: just why is 10 rounds considered an acceptable amount for people like you or myself, and anything else over is unacceptable unless it's for the police or military?\n \n \nSometimes you want concealability and sometimes you want plenty of rounds. Plenty of Tec-9's in the hands of bangers in my town.\n\n \n You're admitting this as a matter of fact? You live in the city of Los Angeles, California, and you're admitting that a prohibited firearm is readily available and in the hands of criminals? A firearm that is no longer produced, and certified by your own state as an \"assault weapon?\"",

   "Just because one Nut Job uses High Capacity magazines, the Anti-gun people think they have the right to take them from all Americans! I say Bovine Excrement! Guns and high capacity magazines are, and have been used by law-abiding people every day, for concealed carry, home protection, and law enforcement. \n \n One misuse does not a case for banning them make. Neither does 10!\n \n A wise man says this when it suits him. \nIf we're going to give up because folks go bad occasionally then where are we?\n \n \n People want high capacity magazines because they DON'T WANT TO BE KILLED, BY SOME SCUM BAG, FOR THE LACK OF SHOOTING BACK! Extra magazines get lost. They are loaded with bullets, and are expensive too. So if one carries a gun, which it is our Constitutional Right to do so, one high capacity magazine will likely be enough. \n \n But who can say that for sure. Do you want to bet my life on that? \n \n Sinjin and company are willing to bet my life, and my wife's life, and our children's lives on the fact that 8 rounds are enough! I say that is a high capacity load of Bovine Excrement! \n \n They want to take more of our Inalienable, Constitutionally recognized as protected Rights from us. Well JACK! Here is the test! Prove your case!\n \n \n Fundamental Right Law test.\n \n \nSince this right is now considered a &#8220;fundamental&#8221; right the test for challenges to these laws is almost certain to be strict scrutiny. \n \n The first part of this test is the &#8220;compelling&#8221; state interest in the regulation. It&#8217;s not &#8220;we would like this law&#8221; or &#8220;we prefer this law&#8221; or even &#8220;we think the law is necessary or advisable.&#8221; The state must show that it has a legitimate interest that is so &#8220;compelling&#8221; it &#8220;compels&#8221; the passage of the infringing law. The best analogy is to argue that the amount of infringement of the right, when compared to ignoring the legitimate compelling interest behind the law, is the lesser of two evils. Here is an example of something SCOTUS has decided is a &#8220;compelling&#8221; state interest:\n \n [I]This Term, in Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S. 103 (1990), we upheld a state statute that proscribed the possession and viewing of child pornography, reaffirming that &#8220;t is evident beyond the need for elaboration that a State's interest in &#8220;safeguarding the physical and [Page 853] psychological wellbeing of a minor&#8221; is &#8220;compelling.\"&#8217;&#8221; Maryland v. Craig, 497 U.S. 836, 852-853 (1990)\n \n So, for any of Mayor Daley&#8217;s proposals, ask yourself can the Mayor establish a &#8220;compelling&#8221; state interest for the law.\n \n If the government can show a &#8220;compelling state interest, then it must next show the law is &#8220;narrowly tailored&#8221; to achieve that interest. In other words, the law: \n \n must be &#8220;precis[e]&#8221; and narrowly &#8220;tailored&#8221; to achieve the &#8220;pin-pointed objective&#8221; of the &#8220;needs of the case&#8221; Tory v. Cochran, 544 U.S. 734, 738 (2005)\n \n See also this language for guidance:\n \n The Government may serve this legitimate interest, but to withstand constitutional scrutiny, &#8220;it must do so by narrowly drawn regulations designed to serve those interests without unnecessarily interfering with First Amendment freedoms. Hynes v. Mayor of Oradell, 425 U.S., at 620; First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 786 (1978).&#8221; Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 444 U.S. 620, 637 (1980). It is not enough to show that the Government's ends are compelling; the means must be carefully tailored to achieve those ends. Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 126 (1989)\n \n So, the next question is can the Mayor demonstrate that his law is a pin point way to achieve the compelling state interest. \n \n Finally, the Government must show that the law in question is the &#8220;least restrictive means&#8221; of addressing the &#8220;compelling&#8221; interest. Or, to put it another way, a judge who does not like the law can think of no less restrictive law to substitute in its place that would effectively deal with the &#8220;compelling&#8221; state interest. \n \n So the test requires proof of a compelling interest for the law, that the law is targeted narrowly and specifically at addressing the compelling interest at stake, and that the law is also the least restrictive (of the right, that is) way to deal with the compelling interest. It&#8217;s not something to be lightly dismissed. See, for example, this case:\n \n Requiring a State to demonstrate a compelling interest and show that it has adopted the least restrictive means of achieving that interest is the most demanding test known to constitutional law. City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 509 (1997)\n \n Now in theory, and mostly in practice, it is a stringent test. But Judges can and in my opinion do bring their own biases to the case. For example, a judge who personally favors abortion rights will look very differently at a state&#8217;s claim to have a &#8220;compelling&#8221; state interest in regulating abortion than a judge who personally dislikes abortion. \n \n Also bear in mind strict scrutiny may not apply to all of the RKBA. SCOTUS has a long history of peeling off portions of &#8220;fundamental&#8221; rights and declaring those portions do not deserve strict scrutiny protection. An example would be free speech. Political speech (like &#8220;vote for this guy&#8221;) gets strict scrutiny protection, but commercial speech (like &#8220;my product is guaranteed to prevent cancer&#8221;) does not. So we have to wait on a case by case challenge basis to see how SCOTUS further defines the 2nd. Amendment liberty interest to see if strict scrutiny will apply in every instance. Finally, there are instances where SCOTUS has found the burden of the regulation is slight enough that it does not require a strict scrutiny analysis. \n \n So there are a lot of variables in play, and I cannot say for certain whether Mayor Daley&#8217;s proposals would survive a challenge. I know he wants the citizens to have to jump through as many burdensome hoops as possible. \n The victory won yesterday is that the mayor can no longer deny the citizens a right to try.\n",

What would you tell someone who demands a full auto firearm on the same grounds that you defend high capacity magazines? Namely, that anything less diminishes his/her abitlity to protect himself and his/her loved ones.\n\n Well I would say, I am not getting sucked into your attempts to sidetrack the thread, so you can confuse the issue, making it LOOK like these are machine guns instead of semi autos!

   "Your exploitation of the death of innocents is highly distasteful Brady. How you've avoided being banned I don't know. With everything you've done and the number of reports that have been filed against you it makes one wonder just what it takes to get banned anymore.\n \n \nChristina Green was killed as a child. We should not have to pay that price because some people dont want to renew the ban on military assault rifles. I think this would be a good thread to repeat my poem in.\n Hopefully it reaches some people here. \n \n Smiling, laughing children\n You kept them safe so that they could play,\n You kept them out of harms way,\n You truly made this world a better place,\n But gun owners would not support you,\n For they could only love their toys,\n And not the little girls and boys,\n They let you die as a child,\n Just as they did the other children,\n Assault Weapons Ban,\n This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you.\n\n \n As I've said earlier in this thread and multiple others, the law you so preciously cling to would have done absolutely nothing to prevent Loughner from carrying out his attack on Giffords and the others present. The law specifically said that it was fully legal to own so-called \"high capacity ammunition magazines\" that were made before the law went into effect, meaning that there was absolutely no way to prevent him from buying one. Even if the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 had been renewed and made permanent and still in effect to this day, the grandfather clause on pre-existing magazines would still be in place. Loughner couldn't have been stopped.\n \n Furthermore I have cited the list of the 10 mass shootings put forth by the Brady Campaign and Violence Policy Center and pointed out that several of them took place during this period where so-called \"high capacity ammunition magazines\" were supposedly restricted and not available to criminals. You never did get back to me on that one and explain how nearly a third of the cited examples were considered a failure.\n \n You also seem to not care about the simple fact that Christina Greene could easily have been killed just the same if Loughner had been in possession of a revolver, or a sawed off shotgun, or even a scoped bolt action rifle that he was using like a sniper would. There's absolutely no evidence to suggest that the Glock model 19 pistol and the so-called \"high capacity ammunition magazine\" ensured that she would die from her wounds by presenting a level of lethality that was unrivaled by other model of guns.\n \n Can you please explain how Loughner's weapon of choice proved to be more lethal to Christina Green, than say a revolver chambered for the .454 Casull, which fires a much bigger bullet at greater velocities and is capable of bringing down medium-to-big game even from a relatively short barreled weapon?\n \n What is it you care more about in this matter Brady? Does your heart truly break for the victims? Or are you more upset about the weapon used? Or is it the number of rounds that were fired at the time? Which is it? What is the factor that upsets you the greatest?",

You can't exercise your rights in a manner to try and deprive others of theirs.\n \n Loughner's actions weren't constitutionally protected. His intent was murder. He planned out a felony action.
