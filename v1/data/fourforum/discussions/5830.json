I always find it interesting that some people can champion psychology while degrading psychiatry where a medical residency is required to understand what medication is actually doing to the physical body, especially on a neurological basis. IMO not unlike comparing a Doctor of Optometry to an ophthalmologist. Do you feel most people actually know the difference? \n \n Cruise is merely pitching his belief system, Scientology, which offers itself as an alternative to psychiatry. L.
