   "I recently wrote the following paper for my 10th grade Principles of English class. It was on the topic of whether or not \"junk food\" should be sold on school campuses. While I am certain it will pass for an A against my teacher's standards, I am almost 100% positive it wouldn't even be taken seriously, let alone into consideration by veteran debaters & enthusiasts alike. So, my question is, where & how could I improve this paper? Which points were weak, which were strong (if any), & which I shouldn't even have included? Please, rip this paper apart, all I ask is that you offer constructive criticism.\n \n \nHouse Bill 2557: Take It or Leave It\n \n According to the Arizona Department of Education (ADE), over the span of thirty years, the number of overweight children between the ages of 6 and 17 have doubled. Furthermore, it is stated that \"25% of children ages 6-11 are obese\" and \"among children between the ages of 12-17, 25% of girls and 18% of boys\" are diagnosed as clinically obese. These statistics coupled by Rep. Mark Anderson's bill to ban unhealthy foods and beverages in both elementary and high schools amidst the state of Arizona has caused much dispute on the credibility and efficiency of the recently revised Arizona Nutrition Standards, barring campuses state-wide from selling previously sold carbonated beverages, fried potato chips, and other snacks. While the opposition to the ban has brought up that as young adults \"these children have quite a bit of responsibility,\" while these children are on school campus, they are under the school's supervision. As the school's job to it's students is to adhere to their well-being, and with the recent proposal to ban all un-nutritious foods and beverages, the school is doing just that; adhering to its students' health - a subdivision of well-being.\n \n Furthermore, Cesar Chavez High School, a school of 2,680 registered students, enforced its ban on junk food on August of 2005. Preceding the ban, it is stated in the January 14, 2006 article in the Arizona Republic entitled Food Fight Hits High Schools that Cesar Chavez High School made a gross income of $30,000 through vending machine sales alone. Succeeding the ban, Victor Mena, assistant principal of Cesar Chavez High School reported a loss of $2,000, an estimated 6.7% decrease in total sales. While it is noted that it is not yet clear that \"all high schools' losses will be minimal,\" it can be predicted that, taking into consideration Cesar Chavez High School is of the top populated schools in the Phoenix Union High School District, schools with a student population less than, equal to, and certainly greater than that of Cesar Chavez High School will show a similar decrease in vending machine sales. Thus, statistically the necessity for food and beverage companies to oppose the bill banning junk food is negated, as they are losing the estimated 6.7% of all sales that Cesar Chavez High School established, assuming each of the 18 schools that make up the Phoenix Union High School District were statistically equivalent to Cesar Chavez High School.\n \n Equally important is that amongst the opposition toward the bill is Todd Elliot, president of the Arizona Automatic Merchandising Council. Elliot, as written in the Arizona Republic article Food Fight Hits High Schools, is quoted saying that \"the problem with the legislation is that it targets only food and doesn't address exercise or nutrition education.\" This statement is false in both circumstances. The ban, while restricting the sales of food that do not meet or exceed the minimal nutritional value, as set by the ADE, allows students the options to either eat the healthier foods being sold by the school, bring a packed lunch from home, or not eat at all. While many share concern in the students starving themselves due to a strong dislike in the foods sold on campus, \"you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink,\" meaning you can make the healthier foods obtainable, but it is up to the individual student whether or not they buy and consume the product. Additionally, through the ban, nutrition education is being implied, as it is bringing an overall awareness of which foods are healthier to consume then the previously sold items students were able to acquire.\n \n Moreover, Rep. Mark Anderson states, \"I don't think we should be providing food that we know is not healthy to children...\" In stating so, we can assume that Anderson is implying good nutrition should start on campus, if no where else, and while many would maintain their position that if the non-nutritious foods cannot be had on campus by elementary and high school students alike, they will find their fix elsewhere, most likely a source close to home. This, unfortunately, cannot be prevented. As previously stated, the school can only do so much pertaining to their students, as their jurisdiction does not apply to situations occurring outside of the school's property line. Regardless, the bill ceasing the sale of said unhealthy foods will be cutting down a previously major provider of these detrimental products, as students are currently exposed to an on-campus market of foods which pose potential problematic circumstances toward their health for the majority of their day.\n \n Also, \"... food and beverage companies are lining up to oppose the legislation,\" states the Arizona Republic article Food Fight Hits High School. It is these food and beverage companies that through opposition are implying lucrative sales of their products reign superior to the health of middle, junior, and high school students. As stated previously, the opposition is fearing that not all schools will endure similar losses in vending machine sales as established by Cesar Chavez High School, while in reality, these losses seem mediocre to the health of America's children. Opposing such a potentially advantageous bill is both immoral and selfish, even more so on the part of the food and beverage companies. Therefore, through opposing the bill, the food health of America's children is being opposed as well.\n \n Subsequently, if the opposition were to succeed in preventing the bill from being enforced, over the span of the next thirty years it can be assumed that the number of overweight children agers 6-17 will have quadrupled, if the statistics noted in the Arizona Nutrition Standards continued to increase. Additionally, following the statistical trend, the percentage of obese children ages 6-11will have reached excesses of 50%, children ages 12-17 will have also reached 50%, of which are girls and 32%, of which are boys. These astonishing statistics hardly seem worth establishing an opposition toward a bill promoting good nutrition and pro-health decisions toward a student-base, millions strong.\n",
