We need those cheap goods to kjeep our economy rolling. Without them, we fail to exist. Additionall,y China has been buying US bonds ad currency in order to keep our economy afloat. If we cease buying those goods, they have no reason to hold those dollars or those bonds. They release those dollars and float the Yuan. Overnight the world has a new reserve currnecy (CW tells us that the only reason the Yuan is nto the worlds reserve currency right now isa that it is pinned to the declining dollar), the dollart falls off the planet, and Americans are starving in the street and dealing with hyperinflaiton.\n \n The only an dbest defense that the US has ever truly had is our industrial infrastructure. It was not our ability to overwhelm the enemy that won WWII, it was our ability to outproduce them. We have lost that ability.\n \n I do not think that a US/China confrontation is entirely out of the question. Failing empires have always made poor military choices in an attempt to prolong their lives. The problem with a war with China is that we dare not make nuclear strikes against their mainland, since the entire planet would quickly be oblitered when they retaliate. The problem is that a large portion of our forces become useless when you consider chinas nuclear arsenal. Going to war agai9nst a country like IRaq with no effective defense (though they have given a good run for our money) is one thing. Going to war against a country that has the ability to take out an entire carrier group with a single weapon is another.",

This is what led to the progressive movement of the late 1880s the industralists were to powerfull.\n \n 4 The rise in power of the christian right.
