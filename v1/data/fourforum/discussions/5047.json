   "I often read the threads here in which creationists attempt to \"demolish\" the science of evolutionary biology; but I do so for the wrong reasons. I read for the laughs.\n \n Some creationists fall by the wayside early, but others return, sometimes on a daily basis, and find their \"arguments\" refuted and ridiculed, their views shredded beyond salvage.\n \n It goes almost without saying that creationists are impervious to reason, evidence, etc. - but what motivates these people ? Do they really think they can do what Darwin himself couldn't do (even if he had wanted to) - which is to reconcile religion with science ? Or are they simply addicted to a form of punishment; i.e. getting their convictions whipped ? \n \n (I once posted a feeble protest when someone, out of his depth, had been torpedoed over and over again.)\n \n But the masochist creationists, like the infantry of Robert E Lee, keep coming. New ones seem to arrive almost daily. I'm convinced this is an American phenomenon and wouldn't happen anywhere else.",

   "I think I, and the other members of what I'll call the \"scientific community\", must be masochists of sorts as well, we continually return to these threads and bang our heads against minds that are stone walls - completely impervious to reason or logic.\n \n I think, no, I know, that there are two main reasons why I return to these threads. The first one is simple, I'm amazed at the scientific illiteracy of the average YEC, especially when science is often their justification for belief.\n \n The second and major reason is simply my fascination with how the mind of the Creationist works. Their desperation to justify their faith is so powerful it drives them to completely abandon mainstream science and logic in favour of an isolated coccoon of reality. The insecurity in their faith that the entire pseudoscience of creationism betrays is the most ironic part. \n \n As you say, most quickly realize that they're in over their heads, that what they've been told in their churches doesn't stand up to scrutiny in the real world. So, rather than continuing down a path that will bring them no good, they retreat and bury their heads in the comforting sand of \"not knowing any better\". However, there always seems to be one or two that are so deeply entrenched, that they simply can't retreat, they've got too much invested.\n \n The psychology, more than the science, is fascinating to me.\n \n Waxy",

   "As an \"evolutionist masochist\", one of the reasons I post here is that defending your arguments against a hostile debater is a great way to find holes in your own understading. Granted, 75% of the posts involve explaining, over and over, what the laws of thermodynamics really mean or other equally pointless dross. However, every once in a while someone will come along with a really insightful question. One poster's questions about homochirality were really good, and I learned alot in doing the research to answer his questions. Also, if your opponent isn't going to cut you any slack then you really have to learn to present your arguments clearly and precisely, which is another good skill to have.",
