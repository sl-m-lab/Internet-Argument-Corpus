   "It sure looked that way when you accused me of not having any principle in reasoning and trying to justify a conclusion instead of basing it upon truth:\n\n This was based on my belief that you were defending the \"if one doesn't believe X, than X may not be imposed on them by law\" principle. I do not see people applying this principle consistently, and hence I said that it appeared to me that folks are picking and choosing when to apply a principle just in order to suit their preferences.\n \n Since you were not defending this, and based on our apparent miscommunication, I shall simply offer my apologies to you.\n \n \nThis is a great way to test, but it's a valid way to test only when the two principles are analogous. I've explained, repeatedly now, why these aren't (in the case of the fetus).\n\n Yet, in principle, they are the same. I think you distinguished abortion from rape on the basis of rights; that a rape victim has rights, whereas a fetus does not. But that distinction does not help in the instance of the principle in question precisely because rights are moral. Thus, to say that a rape victim possesses rights, and therefore those rights should be protected by law, is to force a moral viewpoint onto someone who might not share that view.\n \n To be clear, I do not have a problem in many circumstances with moral beliefs being forced, by law, onto people who might not share those views; and I suspect many others do not either.\n \n \nBecause the cases are not analogous. If the argument is that a moral code is being unjustly applied to a person with a different moral code, this is a point worth discussing. But in the case of an abortion, the fetus has no moral code, so this line of reasoning can't possibly apply.\n\n The initial inquiry was with respect to the woman, not the fetus. It was this: why should a woman be forced by law to adhere to a religious belief she does not believe? Hence, why should a woman be forced by law not to have an abortion when she does not believe that abortion is violating another's rights, that it is not immoral, etc.\n \n Similarly, I asked, why should a rapist be forced by law not to rape another person when he does not believe that raping another person is violating another's rights, that it is not immoral, etc.\n \n I hope that clears it up. You appear to be focusing on the fetus, and I am focusing on the woman.\n \n \nIt's not my schooling, it's my schooling. Er, I mean, I do the schooling.\n\n I'm afraid I'm now confused over even this (wouldn't you know it). I assumed you might be taking tests or wrapping up the school year from your previous post. But perhaps you are a teacher, in which case I still wish you the best in enduring to the end.\n \n \nI see. I've assumed that you were going to argue that the law shouldn't do that. It appears now that I've assumed incorrectly, and that makes this on-topic for this thread. My mistake.\n\n I was just beginning to think that perhaps we were miscommunicating; talking past one another. It's bound to happen in a forum like this, which is why patience is a virtue here. I appreciate your patience, and I hope I've displayed that quality as well.\n \n \nI've got it now. This sounds like a great discussion, especially for me because I haven't spent a lot of time contemplating it.\n Here's what I can say, and I think I know your response: if it's a religious belief, the Constitution prohibits imposition. But I'm sure you and a lot of people feel that it is a moral belief, which isn't so legally clear cut.

True to form they believe in mob rule and what the majority says goes.\n\n \n To you and cap0, and to put a cap on what steeeve just wrote, I post this linked article because it speaks specifically to the cra* that cap0 has been spewing.\n \n Pro-Choice Bigots\n \n By Nat Hentoff\n \n Not too long ago, he was a pro-lifer. He wrote and spoke about the right to life and attacked advocates of abortion rights. \"There are those who argue that the right to privacy is of a higher order than the right to life,\" he would say. \"That was the premise to slavery. You could not protest the existence or treatment of slaves on the plantation, because that was private and therefore outside of your right to be concerned.\" He told the story of how he himself had almost been aborted. A physician had advised his mother to let him go, but she wouldn't. Don't let the pro-choicers convince you that a fetus isn't a human being, he warned: \"That's how the whites dehumanized us, by calling us niggers. The first step was to distort the image of us as human beings in order to justify that which they wanted to do -- and not even feel like they'd done anything wrong.\"\n \n But as Jesse Jackson decided to run for president in 1984, his fiery pro-life rhetoric suddenly subsided. If being black was a political obstacle, being black and pro-life would raise the odds much too high. Jackson understood that it is hard to be a pro-lifer if you want the support of the left -- or just have friends on the left. The lockstep liberal orthodoxy on abortion is pro-choice, as Bill Clinton's election showed and his presidency will reinforce. Dissenters are not tolerated.\n \n Nearly ten years ago I declared myself a pro-lifer. A Jewish, atheist, civil libertarian, left-wing pro-lifer. Immediately, three women editors at The Village Voice, my New York base, stopped speaking to me. Not long after, I was invited to speak on this startling heresy at Nazareth College in Rochester (long since a secular institution). Two weeks before the lecture, it was canceled. The women on the lecture committee, I was told by the embarrassed professor who had asked me to come, had decided that there was a limit to the kind of speech the students could safely hear, and I was outside that limit. I was told, however, that I could come the next year to give a different talk. Even the women would very much like me to speak about one of my specialties, censorship in America. I went and was delighted to talk about censorship at Nazareth.\n \n At the Voice, some of my colleagues in the editorial department wondered, I was told, when I had converted to Catholicism -- the only explanation they could think of for my apostasy. (Once I received a note from someone deep in the ranks of the classified department. She too was pro-life, but would I please keep her secret? Life would be unbearable if anyone knew.)\n \n To others, I was a novelty. Interviews were arranged on National Public Radio and various television programs, and I spoke at one of Fred Friendly's constitutional confrontations on PBS. Afterward, men, women, and teenagers wrote from all over the country that they had thought themselves to be solitary pro-lifers in the office, at school, even at home. They were surprised to find that there was someone else who was against capital punishment, against Reagan and Bush, and dismayed at the annual killing of 1.6 million developing human beings. They felt, they told me, that it was absurd to talk blithely of disposing of potential life. These were lives -- lives with potential to someday do New York Times crossword puzzles and dig Charlie Parker. That is, if they weren't thrown out with the garbage.\n \n I felt less alone myself. In time, I found other heretics. For instance, the bold, witty, crisply intelligent members of Feminists for Life of America. There are some in every state, and chapters in thirty-five. Many of them came out of the civil rights and anti-war movements, and now they also focus on blocking attempts to enact death penalty laws. They have succeeded in Minnesota. You won't see much about Feminists for Life in the press. When reporters look for pro-lifers to interview, they tend to go after pinched elderly men who look like Jesse Helms and women who wear crucifixes.\n \n On the other hand, not all stereotypes are without actual models. As an exotic pro-lifer, I was invited to address an annual Right to Life convention in Columbus, Ohio. The event was held in a large field. A rickety platform faced the predominantly Christian crowd.\n \n I told them that as pro-lifers, they ought to oppose capital punishment and the life-diminishing poverty associated with the policies of their Republican president. Ronald Reagan, I emphasized, had just cut the budget for the WIC program (federally funded Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children). He and those who support him, I said, give credence to Massachusetts Representative Barney Frank's line: \"Those who oppose abortion are pro-life only up to the moment of birth.\"\n \n From the back of the crowd, and then moving forward, there were growls, shouts, and table-thumping. Suddenly, a number of people began rushing toward the platform. I said to the man sitting next to me, a leader of the flock, that I had not quite decided that this cause was worth dying for.\n \n As it happened, the souls on fire only wanted to say that I was in grievous error about these Christian presidents because I had not yet found God. Indeed, I often get letters from religious pro-lifers telling me that it is impossible for me to be simultaneously an atheist and a pro-lifer. Some of the pro-abortion-rights leaders whom I have debated are certain of the same correlation. No serious atheist, no Jewish atheist, no left-wing atheist could want to -- as my fiercely pro-choice wife puts it -- enslave women.\n \n Yet being without theology isn't the slightest hindrance to being pro-life. As any obstetrics manual -- Williams Obstetrics, for example -- points out, there are two patients involved, and the one not yet born \"should be given the same meticulous care by the physician that we long have given the pregnant woman.\" Nor, biologically, does it make any sense to draw life-or-death lines at viability. Once implantation takes place, this being has all the genetic information within that makes each human being unique. And he or she embodies continually developing human life from that point on. It misses a crucial point to say that the extermination can take place because the brain has not yet functioned or because that thing is not yet a \"person.\" Whether the life is cut off in the fourth week or the fourteenth, the victim is one of our species, and has been from the start.\n \n Yet rational arguments like these are met with undiluted hostility by otherwise clear-thinking liberals. Mary Meehan, a veteran of the anti-war movement, tried to pierce this pall of left orthodoxy in a 1980 article in The Progressive:\n \n Some of us who went through the anti-war struggles of the 1960s and 1970s are now active in the right-to-life movement. We do not enjoy opposing our old friends on the abortion issue, but we feel that we have no choice. We are moved by what pro-life feminists call the \"consistency thing\" -- the belief that respect for human life demands opposition to abortion, capital punishment, euthanasia, and war....It is out of character for the left to neglect the weak and helpless. The traditional mark of the left has been its protection of the underdog, the weak, and the poor....The unborn child is the most helpless form of humanity, even more in need of protection than the poor tenant farmer or the mental patient.\n \n Meehan's article provoked an extraordinary amount of mail. A few writers praised The Progressive for having enough respect for its readers to expose them to a perspective opposite to the magazine's. But the great percentage of letter writers were furious, indignant that a \"left\" magazine should print such vicious right-wing propaganda.\n \n Because defending the killing of the fetus is inconsistent with the liberal/left worldview in other matters, the abortion rights orthodoxy has relied on extraordinary hypothetical arguments to justify its position in the twenty years since the Roe decision. Take two examples. In 1971, when abortion was legalized in New York State, an editorial on WCBS radio in New York attempted to define abortion as an act of compassion: \"It is one sensible method of dealing with such problems as overpopulation, illegitimacy, and possible birth defects,\" the announcer said. \"It is one way of fighting the rising welfare rolls and the increasing number of child abuse cases.\"\n \n In 1992 the defense has changed. No longer a means of compassion, abortion is now viewed as a form of preemptive law enforcement. As Nicholas von Hoffman writes in the New York Observer:\n \n \"Free, cheap abortion is a policy of social defense. To save ourselves from being murdered in our beds and raped on the streets, we should do everything possible to encourage pregnant women who don't want the baby and will not take care of it to get rid of the thing before it turns into a monster....\n \n \"At their demonstrations, the anti-abortionists parade around with pictures of dead and dismembered fetuses. The pro-abortionists should meet these displays with some of their own: pictures of the victims of the unaborted -- murder victims, rape victims, mutilation victims -- pictures to remind us that the fight for abortion is but part of the larger struggle for safe homes and safe streets.\"\n \n As a sometime admirer of von Hoffman, I take this to be -- maybe -- his assuming the role of Jonathan Swift in these hard times, but it doesn't matter particularly whether he's serious or not. Those who see abortion as a cost-effective, even humane, way to thin the ranks of the lower orders are not few in number.\n \n Pro-choicers clearly are only interested in their version of the choice in this matter. But why are the liberals among them so immovably illiberal only when it comes to abortion? The male pro-choicers, by and large, consider this to be entirely an issue for women to decide. And the only women they know are pro-choice. If a man has any doubts or subversive ambivalences, he keeps them to himself because should he speak of them, he will be banished from the company of all the progressive women he knows -- and any whom he might hope to know.\n \n Pro-choice women are so unyielding because they profoundly believe that without the power to abort at will, they will be enslaved. Once an abortion is wanted, the fetus, as one woman told me, is -- to some women -- \"The enemy within.\" In the fight not to be enslaved, liberalism in an abstraction.\n \n Accordingly, I am no longer surprised to find myself considered an external enemy. For years, American Civil Liberties Union affiliates around the country invited me to speak at their fund-raising Bill of Rights dinners. But once I declared myself a pro-lifer, all such invitations stopped. They know I agree with them on most ACLU policies, but that no longer matters. I am now no better than Jesse Helms. Free speech, after all, has its limits.\n \n This disdain on the left for anything or anyone pro-life has clearly taken a toll on the political process. Liberal/left politicians who remain true to their philosophy and oppose abortion are virtually impossible to find. Like Jackson, most simply cave in to abortion rights pressure, fearing that no matter how left-leaning they are on other issues, if they come out against abortion they will be branded as right-wing fanatics. Governor Robert Casey of Pennsylvania, a liberal pro-life Democrat, was forbidden from speaking at this year's Democratic convention. And when The Village Voice later offered him a forum in New York to talk and answer question about whether it is possible to be both liberal and pro-life, he (and I, the putative moderator) was shouted down by pro-choicers. Meanwhile, the president-elect, who has been on both sides of the abortion question during his career, has already pledged to satisfy his pro-choice backers by requiring that any nominee to the Supreme Court be an explicit and public supporter of abortion rights.\n \n I saw Jesse Jackson recently on a train, and we talked for quite a while about George Bush's awful nomination of Ed Carnes to the federal bench. An assistant attorney general in Alabama, Carnes built his reputation of sending people to \"Yellow Mama,\" the state's electric chair. He would replace Frank Johnson, whom Martin Luther King once described as \"the man who gave true meaning to the word justice.\" (A few weeks later Jackson joined the campaign to defeat the nomination. To no avail. Carnes was eventually confirmed.) I then asked Jackson about another form of execution. I told him that in speeches I often quote what he wrote as a pro-lifer. He looked uncomfortable. I asked him if he still believed what he said then. \"I'll get back to you on that,\" he said. He hasn't yet.\n \n The New Republic\n November 30, 1992\n http://prolife.liberals.com/articles/hentoff.html",

Hence, a law prohibiting rape could not be imposed on a rapist; a law prohibiting theft could not be imposed upon thieves; a law prohibiting murder could not be imposed upon murderers; so long as any of these classes of people do not share the moral belief that their victims have rights.

The IAG's worthy attempt to draw attention to an important problem is undermined by its diagnosis.\n \n Article continues\n advertisement\n \n Celebrity culture is driven by the confusion and moral illiteracy that dominates the adult world. The cause of the problem lies with grown-up people who have bought into the voyeuristic culture of the celebrity.\n \n Is it any surprise that children and teenagers adopt the values and manners of their elders?\n \n When serious public debate usually takes the form of taking sides on who was right and who was wrong on the latest edition of Big Brother, teenagers can be forgiven for regarding ostentatious exhibitionism as merely a lifestyle choice.\n \n Sex, drugs and alcohol are merely the artefacts of a world view that believes that drawing attention to yourself is the high-point of human achievement.\n \n Unfortunately the IAG's report is not inclined to confront the true nature of the problem. Its diagnosis of a 'teenage health problem' misses the point altogether. What is at stake is not so much unhealthy lives but ones that lack a moral compass and social focus.\n \n The report follows the depressing tendency to transform the problem of morality into that of health. Unable to articulate the language of right and wrong, organisations like the IAG prefer to adopt the vocabulary of health. Which is why they talk about a sexual health crisis.\n \n The transformation of a moral into a medical problem is bad enough. What's worse is that the focus on teenagers distracts attention from the real problem, which is that of adult behaviour.\n \n That is why the proposal to solve the problem through changing the behaviour of teenagers will prove to be futile. As is the norm in 21st century Britain, proposals to change behaviour inevitably lead to demands to change the curriculum.\n \n The only consequence of piling on more health promotion and sex education on the curriculum is to further distract teachers from providing their students with a real education.\n \n There is also considerable evidence that sex education and PHSE lessons simply do not work. After decades of such initiatives one would imagine that even the most dogmatic sex educationalist would concede this point.\n \n If we want to tackle the corrosive impact of celebrity culture we need to have a grown-up discussion about it. One that principally involves adults rather than children.\n And here's more on the link between promiscuity and abortion.\n \n http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2008/mar/08033107.html\n \n Planned Parenthood hawks \"free love\" and encourage promiscuous sex for Teens\n Tells how to go around parents to get contraceptives\n March 31, 2008 (pop.org) - The United States of America has the highest teen pregnancy rate in the Western world. According to the Alan Guttmacher Institute's 2002 report, 75 out of every 1,000 girls aged 15-19 in the United States will get pregnant. Twenty-one out of every 1,000 will get an abortion.\n \n One reason why our teen pregnancy and abortion rate is so high is because of Planned Parenthood's relentless targeting of our young people. Americans need to understand that most teen abortions don't start when a girl walks into a Planned Parenthood abortion clinic. They start when a slick Planned Parenthood operator walks into a classroom, or a teen logs onto a cleverly designed Planned Parenthood website.\n \n Teenwire.com, with its aggressively contemporary layout and affable, \"teen-friendly\" graphics, is designed to attract youth used to surfing Myspace and YouTube. With beautiful colors and an eye-catching layout, combined with such hooks as \"Ask the Experts\" and \"In Your Own Words,\" it is primed for maximum outreach to its target audience of teenagers.\n \n Furthermore, even though the site is obviously aimed at very young teens, even children, it makes no attempt at discretion when speaking of sexuality. In flash animations with titles like \"How to Use a Condom: Watch and Learn\" and \"Am I Normal? Behind the Fig Leaf,\" teenagers are exposed to very graphic depictions of male and female genitalia, sexual acts, and physical development. No attempt is made to respect either the subject being treated, or the vulnerable nature of the teenage psyche being subjected to such needlessly explicit information. Pictures and graphic depictions abound.\n \n Abortion, on the other hand, is treated with a breezy vagueness. The website is devoid of pictures or diagrams of abortion procedures. Abortion is always treated with the gentlest of language and risks are described as negligible. The site assures us that abortion is \"about twice as safe as having your tonsils removed.\" Moreover, it assures its innocent readers that there is no such thing as post-abortion trauma, never mind the millions of real women in the real world who suffer from it. \n \n Fifty years after the poisonous fruits of the so-called sexual revolution are all too evident, Planned Parenthood continues to hawk \"free love\" and encourage promiscuous sex. Instead of encouraging responsibility, Planned Parenthood instead inundates youth with ever more sexual imagery. \n \n Research shows that teens respond when challenged to be chaste and to reject promiscuity. But Planned Parenthood will have none of this.\n \n And why should they? This year, they will receive $305 million dollars of tax money in order to promote sterile sex and a contraceptive mentality. And when contraception fails, they benefit as well, by selling abortions.\n My question is, how can you possibly live in this Country or world today and not be aware of the affect our Pop Culture is having on the sex life of our society? And if these problems are seen in our young people, how deep is you ignorance and denial not to recognize that the young people are learning this sexual irresponsibility and promiscuity from the adults in their lives and community? Talk about a no brainer, and yet it's beyond you to even recognize it? All I can say is thank God no woman will give you children because as a responsible adult, you're asleep at the wheel.",

You need to show the links, not just say that there is promiscuity.\n \n \nThis article speaks directly to teen age promiscuity and how it is a reflection of what kids see happening in the adult community they learn from.\n\n Gee, Archie, that's all fine and dandy information there, but there's not a single bit of data in that article that relates promiscuity and abortion.\n \n Here's what's even worse for you, Archie. The article doesn't even talk about promiscuity.pro\u00b7mis\u00b7cu\u00b7ous\n 3 : not restricted to one sexual partnerNowhere does this article talk about girls having multiple sexual partners. A girl's having, say, two boyfriends (one at a time) over, say, four years and having sex with the one she is dating at the time does not make her promiscuous.\n \n \nAnd here's more on the link between promiscuity and abortion.\n\n Oh look, a perfectly neutral article from a perfectly neutral site: emoticon_rolleyes\n \n But fine. Let's ignore the blatant propagandism. Let's ignore the implicit (and explicit) denigration of educating youths about contraception. Let's find that link between promiscuity and abortion.\n \n So, we look for data.\n \n Let's see... There's a sentence that says that there are teens who get abortions.\n \n There's a sentence that boldly claims that the reason for this is Planned Parenthood's \"targeting\" of youths.\n \n Near the bottom, the author proclaims that PP promotes promiscuous sex.\n \n Is there data? Any data at all that links promiscuity to abortion? Nope. Not a lick of data in the article past the first paragraph. None of the links that Archie promised us are there.\n \n Archie presented these two articles as evidence for a link between promiscuity and abortion. Neither did it. This is what he actually attempted to do. He didn't even try to support his lie that irresponsibility and abortion are necessarily linked.\n \n We should point out that none of these allegations made in the article have any actual support. The author didn't link to these allegedly terrible pieces of information. He didn't show any evidence that the PP site's information actually causes the effects that he says it does. In the real world -- which is, Archie, the one that counts -- the article is worthless.\n \n We should also point out that even this anti-PP propagandist site says that the PP site acknowledges that parents should generally be consulted and that contraception should be used. Only a dolt would believe that encouraging the proper use of contraception would lead to an increase in abortion rates.

Baklinski\n \n DUBLIN, April 11, 2008 (LifeSiteNews.com) - Girls who become sexually active before age 17 are almost 70 percent more likely to experience a crisis pregnancy in later life and three times more likely to procure abortion in their lifetime than those who wait until they are older, according to a study released by the Irish Crisis Pregnancy Agency.\n \n The Irish Study of Sexual Health and Relationships, the largest nationally representative study on sexual knowledge, attitudes and behaviour ever undertaken in Ireland, was published by the Department of Health and the Crisis Pregnancy Agency (CPA) today.\n \n The research found that 14.9 per cent of men and 7.9 per cent of women first engaged in sex when they were less than 16 years old. A majority of the women in that group (59 percent) and more than a third of the men (37 percent) regretted it.\n \n The study states, \"Lower age of first sex is strongly associated with regret at the timing of first sex, among both men and women.\"\n \n \"According to research, the majority of young people wait until they are 17 or older to have sex for the first time,\" said the CPA's chairperson Katharine Bulbulia.\n \n \"However, for those who have had sex before 17, the research shows the impact of early first sex on the individual's later sexual health, and suggests that some young people...are having first sex at a time that is not right for them.\n \n \"We need to equip young people with the knowledge and skills they need to delay their first sexual experience.\"\n \n The report explained that the average age of first sexual encounter for both men and women has steadily declined over the last half century. \"Most people now in their 20s will have had their first sexual experience before they were 18.\" The study found that the current median age of first sexual intercourse is 18 for men and 19 for women. The median age for men currently aged 60 to 64 is 22; for women, 23. For men and women currently under 25, it is 17.\n \n The survey of more than 7,400 men and women, found early school dropouts were more likely to lose their virginity as young teenagers than those who stayed in school and completed their education.\n \n The study also found that, for people under 30, 38 percent of men and around 20 percent of women said they were under the influence of alcohol or drugs when they lost their virginity.\n \n The study recommended, \"Parents need to be acknowledged as the primary relationships and sexuality educators of their children, and to be supported in that role. They need supports provided through a range of initiatives. These supports should particularly address the needs of parents who most need assistance, such as those in lower socio-economic groups.\"\n \n The study also stated, \"Health promotion strategies need to foster more responsible public behaviour concerning the use of alcohol and illicit drugs, given their role in sexual encounters.\"\n \n http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2008/apr/08041104.html",

It's another propaganda piece saying that teenagers who have sex are more likely to have abortions at some point in their lifetime.

It is not evidence that any abortions are due to promiscuity or irresponsibility.\n 0-for-5.\n \n How in the hell can you read these articles and believe that they support your points? Either you're lying shamelessly or you can't read for comprehension; we have substantial evidence for the latter, but considering you keep repeating your claims about promiscuity and irresponsibility without having any evidence for it, I'm thinking the former applies as well.",

Here it is. http://deaconforlife.blogspot.com/2008/05/no-ordinary-funeral-see-operation.html\n \n The blog is even titled Deacon for Life, just as your quote is titled 9 posts above.",

So Baklinski wrote the article, \"A New Writer Reflects on Writing for LifeSiteNews at Christmas Time\"\n By Thaddeus M. Baklinski which was posted on the Deacon for Life blog, http://deaconforlife.blogspot.com/2007/12/blessed-christmas-to-all-my-readers.html and you attribute the quote at the top of the blog to him? Couldn't you find something from his article to condemn him with? And do you consider that as a proper critique of his truth?",
