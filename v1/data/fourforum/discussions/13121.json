   "Income inequality in the United States is at an all-time high, surpassing even levels seen during the Great Depression, according to a recently updated paper by University of California, Berkeley Professor Emmanuel Saez. The paper, which covers data through 2007, points to a staggering, unprecedented disparity in American incomes. On his blog, Nobel prize-winning economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman called the numbers \"truly amazing.\"\n \n Though income inequality has been growing for some time, the paper paints a stark, disturbing portrait of wealth distribution in America. Saez calculates that in 2007 the top .01 percent of American earners took home 6 percent of total U.S. wages, a figure that has nearly doubled since 2000.\n \n As of 2007, the top decile of American earners, Saez writes, pulled in 49.7 percent of total wages, a level that's \"higher than any other year since 1917 and even surpasses 1928, the peak of stock market bubble in the 'roaring\" 1920s.'\"\n\n Income Inequality Is At An All-Time High: STUDY\n \n Also, I reference the following...\n Historical Income Tables - Families\n Under Clinton (1992-2000) average (\"mean\") household income rose $15164.\n Under Bush (2000-2007) average (\"mean\") household income FELL $348.\n This is adjusted for inflation under \"2007 dollars\"\n \n The economic policies of the last eight years just ARE NOT WORKING for America.\n The rich get richer, and the average guy gets poorer.\n \n And don't get me wrong. I have nothing against the rich being rich.\n But when the economic policies DISADVANTAGE most people, it's something that NEEDS to stop.\n \n Under Clinton, BOTH the rich AND the average working man did well.\n BOTH incomes rose.\n \n Under Bush's policies, the rich got richer, and the average working man went into the toilet.\n And I think you can lay a LOT of the prolonged aspect of this recession at the door-step of the people whose policies lead to that.\n \n Sure. The recession was instigated by a housing market bubble burst.\n But the problem that prolonged the recession is because the working class is weaker.\n \n Republicans will habitually try to convince people that we owe our success to the rich. That we have to give them tax breaks in order for our paycheck to survive.\n That is hogwash.\n Under Bush, the rich got NUMEROUS tax breaks, and look where we are today...\n The 2007 income (note, pre-recession) has the average worker losing money from their paycheck over the Bush years that saw numerous upper class tax cuts...",

   "I thought you were aware, Jo, I'm putting forward a viewpoint associated with the Austrian school.\n \n Key differences you might notice (I'm generalising slightly here):\n \n Austrians tend to advocate ending the fed, monetarists tend to want to target a specific monetary base growth rate, using the fed, or have some other scheme in mind, tending to be a bit on the conservative side (though not always).\n \n Monetarists believe that insufficient money creation is an evil, and can lead to recessions and depressions. Whereas the Austrians believe that the business cycle is the result of earlier inflation of the money supply. \n \n Regarding the great depression for example, monetarists believe that the fed should have more aggressively inflated to counter the downturn, whereas Austrians don't believe that it should have responded with inflation at all.\n \n The federal reserve is currently a hybrid of monetarism and neo-keynesianism... I don't think it should exist.\n \n Monetarist's tend to believe \"excessive\" increases in the money supply cause inflation, Austrians believe *all* increase in the money supply is inflationary (price changes due to e.g. higher productivity, seasonal variations are not)",

   "Wow.\n So because the average worker did very well under Clinton, does that mean that Clinton SHRANK the government?\nWell first of all your logic is flawed. Your comparison is Clinton vs Bush not Clinton vs \"very well\". Second, you should be aware that just because something happens while someone is president doesn't mean they were the cause of it. Finally, Clinton didn't run up a deficit like Bush did so yeah, I guess the somewhat scaled back expansion that Clinton had was better off that Bush. \n \n \nOr is it more accurate to observe that you are trying to lay blame to one of your political ideology enemies, when no real blame belongs there...\nI believe I'm blaming across party lines. \n \n \nAnd if you're going to try to blame this all on \"budget\", you're going to have to give a really good explanation as to why a dollar spent by the government can be so damaging, while a dollar spent by corporations and the rich are supposedly so good...\na dollar spent by the government isn't always a bad thing but spending an ever increasing amount of borrowed dollars is. Furthermore, even if it wasn't borrowed you have a problem with spending more. The problem is simple. Government has no goal. This applies mainly to the federal government. Basically they can spend money or not. Naturally the only way they look better is to do more things and to do that requires more money. Eventually you become a Roman Empire. Big government is no different from a big corporation in terms of greed. If is almost self evident that a bigger government would produce a richer few and greater poor/middle class.\n \n In any event, bigger government tends to cause the inflation thing more than a natural market would. Furthermore, a natural market handles it better and faster and more \"correctly\". This isn't an argument against all regulation but we should certainly keep it at a bare minimum...something we haven't done and probably helped us get to where we are now.",
