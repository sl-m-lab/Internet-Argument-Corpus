   "One of my favorite parts of the bible (yes, there are some parts I enjoy reading on occasion emoticon_xangel):\n \n 1 Corinthians 13\n Love \n 1 If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. 2 If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. 3 If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames, but have not love, I gain nothing. \n 4 Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5 It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. \n \n 8 Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. 9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 10 but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears. 11 When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me. 12 Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known. \n \n 13 And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.\n http://www.biblegateway.com",

   "I probably use the word faith more loosely than you guys do. I don't have any aversion to using the word. And I apply it in the context of what I understand the definition of the word to mean, both from the dictionary and the bible. I also use the word faithful in the common usage. Faith is just as much a secular concept as it is a religious one, and it is not proprietary to the realm of supernatural beliefs. But I digress, there is no reason why anyone needs to use the word in a situation that it may apply to if they don't want to. Trust, presume, induce and believe convey the same general idea.",
