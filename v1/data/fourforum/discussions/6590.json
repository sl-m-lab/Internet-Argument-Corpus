You get into it and discover that it does not have seats and a steering wheel, and not controls. You open the hood, look inside, and utter something like \"omg wtf where is the engine?!\". This happened because your car was created, but some parts didn't actually have enough time to make it into the car, so they are somewhere on the way. \n \n But no, when you come to the dealer, you new shiny car is in one piece, ready to drive. Isn't it.\n \n In the same way, if we assume that the world was created, we assume that it was created pretty much the same way we can see it now. Yes, with light. Even Bible gives an account of creation where light appeared before the stars. \n \n But from your first post I see that you are not even going to consider any arguments, no matter how they sound, because you already made up your mind and said that anything creationists will say is stupid, crazy and anti-scientific. I guess you are a known scientist who knows everything and you are in a place to make that kind of judgements.\n \n By the way, my personal opinion is that real scientists are trying to be objecticve and actually explore something before completely trashing it. This makes me think that you are not one of those people. Just an angry arrogant \n skeptic who doesn't really care about knowing truth.\n \n So good luck to you in your efforts.",

Isn't it.\n \n In the same way, if we assume that the world was created, we assume that it was created pretty much the same way we can see it now.\n\n You've got to make up your mind. If I go to buy a new car, I expect a nice shiny new car in one piece, I expect minimal dirt on the exterior (and interior), I expect that the pistons aren't caked with semi-burned oil, I expect that the cylinders aren't marked with frictional wear... That is, I expect it to look like it hasn't been around for 14 billion years.\n So for your analogy to work, you'd have to expect a nice, clean universe that looks like it hasn't been around for 14 billion years. But we do indeed see a universe that looks like it's been around for 14 billion years. We see an earth covered in 4+ billion years of dirt. We see a history of that earth in geologic features. We see the signs of tectonic movement over millions of years. That's exactly the opposite of what you say you'd expect! Your analogy argues against your point.\n \n \n \nEven Bible gives an account of creation where light appeared before the stars.\n\n An absurdity in itself. You acknowledge that light comes from the stars, yet you stand by the Bible's stating that light came before stars. Care to explain that?\n \n \nOk, beat this responce. If it's wrong then prove why it wrong.\n\n Well, I thought I did. Perhaps you didn't understand.\n \n We can look at the rings of a tree to determine how old it is. We can also determine other things, such as relative lengths of growing seasons and times of catastrophies. If I were to cut down a tree just after it was \"created,\" I would be able to infer a growth pattern and relative seasonal information.. even though there was no growth pattern and there were no seasons.\n \n In the same way, if we look at a star that is 10 billion light years away, we are seeing the events that happened at that star 10 billion years ago.\n If this creationist \"response\" is correct, and the light we see didn't originate 10 billion years ago, what is the light telling us? It's telling us a story of stellar events that never happened. That's like writing a history book about events that never took place... Or at the very least, that would be like someone reading my daily journal of the events that took place in my life millions of years before I was born.\n Unless you can explain why we would see this false information, this response leaves you stuck with a trickster God.\n Moreover, true to SkepticGunt's word, this view is unscientific because it is completely unfalsifiable. \"Because that's how God made it\" is not a scientific claim.\n \n \nThis is assuming that the time dimension has always had the same properties as it has now.\n\n Not really, just that it's had the same properties for the past many billion years. I'm sticking with Relativity on this one.\n \n \nWhat do you know about dimensions before the Big Bang?\n\n It's my understanding that there was no such thing as dimension before the Big Bang.\n \n \nWhat do you know about properties of time after the big bang?\n\n Past Planck time, I'm once again sticking with Relativity. Considering that 6000 years is so insignificantly small compared to several billion years, you'd be hard pressed to prove that things have changed significantly (or at all, really) between the time the first stars were born and now.\n \n \n I find it interesting that you're analyzing fine points of the Big Bang (as opposed to refuting the theory entirely) while simultaneously insinuating that there's nothing wrong with starlight being created.",

If God created light that was already \"on the way\", He would know that it would make the universe look billions of years old. In fact, the light we see from other galaxies is the strongest evidence for an ancient universe. Therefore, God wanted the universe to look ancient. However, it says in his Bible that the universe is only 6000 years old. This would mean that God had deliberately set things up to look like the Bible was wrong. While God may test people's faith by visiting plagues on them, or giving impossible orders like \"Kill your son\", no where in the Bible do we see him trying to trick people into thinking he doesn't exist. God is a jealous God; his first commandment is to worship Him and no other. He wouldn't set up the universe to make it look like His holy book was wrong, if He in fact wanted it to be taken as literally true. The only reasonable conclusion that doesn't make God out to be intentionally trying to drive followers away is that the universe is billions of years old just as it appears, and that Genesis is not meant to be taken literally.",

Its like saying science is part of creationism as it believes the universe was created, regardless of how. Creationism (with a capital C is a literal interpretation of the bible, though is not nessesarily YEC)\n\n I think you ARE talking about the YEC specifically. Do you think that creationism would not emerge as a scientific view if there was no Bible?",

   "I don't see your point. Creationists are those who hold the view that there is an intelligent force, or a personal Creator, behind the origin of the Universe. It does not matter what religious view a creationist holds.\nPerhaps if you paid attention you wouldn't sound so silly. Clearly, from the OP, Skepticgunt was using the term \"creationist\" in the generally understood sense, i.e., someone who believes that the earth was created in 6 literal days some 6,000 years ago. You, however, in an effort to appear superior, conflate that with anyone who believes in a god creator. Either you are ignorant of reality, or you are dishonest.\n \n We are all aware that there are \"creationists\" who believe a variety of things, some of them less intelligent than others. For example, there are the\n \n Flat Earth Creationists: Flat earthers not only believe that the universe was created in 6 literal 24 hour days about 6,000 years ago, they also believe that the earth is flat in spite of any evidence. Flat earthers are few in numbers and are generally laughed at by everyone, even other creationists. However, flat earthers are actually the only creationists who actually read the Bible literally, although others claim to do so. There used to be a web site of a flat earth christian organization that claimed a couple of hundred members. I've never met one.\n \n Geocentrists: A little more progressive, at least having moved forward to the 14th century, geocentrists recognize that the earth is a sphere, only they maintain that the earth is the center of the universe. I've actually run into two of these on the internet and there is a PhD physicist with a web site who is a geocentrist. Still, geocentrists maintain that the earth was created in 6 literal 24 hour days about 6,000 years ago. They read the Bible literally, all except for the parts where the earth is described as flat. Geocentrists don't seem to know the difference between \"circle\" and \"sphere,\" two different words for two different geometric shapes even in ancient Hebrew. There aren't many geocentrists either.\n \n Young Earth Creationists: The most vocal of the creationists. These are the people of the ICR, Answers in Genesis, and ARN. These are the creationists who attempted to outlaw the teaching of evolutionary theory in high school biology, who invented \"creation science\" in an effort to replace real science, or at least get \"equal time\" for their religion in school science classes. This is \"creationism\" as it is understood by the vast majority of people when the word is used without modification. This I believe, is what SkepticGunt meant by \"creationist.\" Since the speed of light is relevant only if one claims a young earth, then any other representation of the word in this discussion would be disengenuous. YECs interpret the Bible extensively in order to accept a spherical earth that orbits the sun and exists in one of billions of galaxies in the universe.\n \n Old Earth Creationists: There are several versions of old earth creationism. The lines between them are somewhat muddled. All are attempts to reconcile the Bible with reality. There are the Gap Creationists who claim that there was a large span of time between Genesis 1:1 and Genesis 1:2 in order to give the universe great age. And then there are the Day Age Creationists who claim that each day of the creation was really a vast age. Some Day agers even pretend that the order of creation in Genesis parallels reality as revealed by science. Progressive Creationists hold that the creation has been ongoing, with various exterminations and recreations of \"kinds\" throughout the long history of the universe. Progressive Creationists are more likely to accept some evolution within \"kinds,\" a term rarely defined but usually fixed somewhere around the taxonomic classification of family. Of course, mankind is an exception, and not related to any other \"kind\" even though there is better than 98% similarity in the genes of humans and chimpanzees, and better than 96% similarity in other regions of the genome.\n \n Intelligent Design Creationists: IDers usually can fit into any of the Old Earth Creationist beliefs. It is rare to find a YEC who is willing to relax his dogma enough to accept ID.\n \n Theistic Evolutionists: These, like OECs, come in a range of beliefs that run from a personal creator god to a belief more like deism. Some may also be called \"Evolutionary Creationists.\"\n \n Finally there are Materialist Evolutionists: This latter also incorporates a range of belief from the belief that nature must be explained by naturalistic causes (methodological naturalism) to those who assert that nothing exists except matter, energy and their interactions (materialistic naturalism).\n \n So there you go, Ringu. Clearly the discussion was originally intended to be about YEC. Now I'm not claiming that you can't broaden the discussion to the beliefs of other creationists who take the Bible less as reality and more as mythology, it's just that you need to be clear. Of course, the OP doesn't apply to most OECs, and you confuse the issue when you discuss them without making it clear that you are doing so.\n \n In the future, please be aware that \"creationist\" most usually means YEC on most discussion boards. If you can't figure it out by context, then ask instead of jumping in with ad hominem remarks that add little to the discussiion.\n \n Now, would you like to go back and discuss the speed of light in relation to creationists beliefs?",

   "I have read this entire thread, most of it a waste of self propagated supposed free thinkers, with unarmed Creation defenders as their foil.\n \n Sorry, I just wanted to sound as important as the rest of you.\n \n On to the discussion at hand \"Speed of light\" and how does the creation account deal with it. Did anyone actually read the Genisis account before entering a post here? First let me ask if anyone here speaks or reads Hebrew? It is documented fact that during the interpretation to english there are elements of the original language that are dropped. For instance, in the english we might see the word \"Yellow\" but in the hebrew the word or phrase might mean \"Lemon Yellow fading to white\", so the detail is absent although the truth exists. Genisis 1:1 states God created the heavens and the earth this is not attached to a day of creation, It also states that the earth was dark, a few verses later the stars are created along with our moon and sun. So if God created the heavens in the \"beginning\" but not the stars what was created? Now the scientists need to use a common scientific excersize here. Extrapolation. If you can get a man from a monkey you have to atleast allow that the creation accounted for in genisis is speaking of only local stars and planets. Local on the scale of the Milkyway. The previous creation was a creation was a creation that leaves earth dark. I dont see where God created light on the first day, I see where God brought light into existance as it is relevant to the earth. Verse 3 of the creation account onward is dealing with the earth, Prior to verse 3 there is creation that is not earth centered. Since God had no time prior to setting the days in motion which is mentioned in verse 5, isnt it with in the realm of possible that the elapse between Genesis 1:1 and 1:3 is the percieved missing 40 odd billion yrs? There by giving the light time to arrive.\n \n I do not believe that God made the earth appearing old, I believe it was created just as the verse said formless and void and sat here for however many, million yrs you need to give it to feel like a scientist. But life is 8000 or so yrs old, and that is so provable it is ridiculous. \n \n Oh, by the earlier a post said the Bible was wrong in every scientific catagory, that is a factually incorrect statement. I would be glad to go to the appropriate thread and let you start with Archeology, and try to prove it wrong.",

That is from data from the COBI and WMAP projects.\n \n Of course it's easy to show that the earth is 8,000 years old. For example, there are varves in a lake in Central America that show corn pollen that is about 11,000 years old. Varves in a lake in Japan have been counted. There are about 45,000 of them. Of course, since you have entered into a debate on the age of life and evolutionary theory, you must be aware that varves are formed by organic material, specifically dead algae. And of course there are the fossils that are found around the world that date back millions of years. Yes indeed, it is easy to show that life is at least 8.000 years old.",

To determine a fossil's age, igneous layers (volcanic rock) beneath the fossil (predating the fossil) and above it (representing a time after the fossil's existence) are dated, resulting in a time-range for the fossil's life. So that said, again the material making up the rock is \"whatever\" age that doesnt mean the fossil is of the same age. Any sort of dating method used starts from the basis that the object being dated is alive in a closed system, in other words it assumes that the object is obtaining two seperate Carbons at the exact rate. It also assumes that EVERY object is obtaining these carbons at that exact same rate.\n \n \nClive wrote,\n Oh and could you please explain the relevance of osmosis in the above?\nIn the same way that a piece of meat retains the seasons of the marinate, the fossil would retain some elements of the material surrounding it.\n \n \nClive wrote,\n This one puzzles me.

   "Radioisotope dating cannot be used directly on fossils since they don't contain the unstable radioactive isotopes used in the dating process. To determine a fossil's age, igneous layers (volcanic rock) beneath the fossil (predating the fossil) and above it (representing a time after the fossil's existence) are dated, resulting in a time-range for the fossil's life.\nEssentially correct. Except that the fossil may or may not contain radioactive isotopes. The important concept is that they aren't useful for dating. They have been carried into the fossil by ground water and the source could never be determined.\n \nSo that said, again the material making up the rock is \"whatever\" age that doesnt mean the fossil is of the same age.\nWhat it does mean is that a fossil is older than the age of the layer above that was dated, and younger than the layer below that was dated. The concept is actually quite simple.\n \nAny sort of dating method used starts from the basis that the object being dated is alive in a closed system, in other words it assumes that the object is obtaining two seperate Carbons at the exact rate.\nWhat terrible ignorance. There is no assumption of a closed system since they do not exist on earth. Nor does the object being dated have to have once been alive. The process that you started out discussing has nothing to do with carbon. What exactly do you mean by \"two seperate [sic] Carbons?\" How do you \"obtain\" a carbon at some exact rate? In order to give you a little help, whether an object being dated because it is between two geologic strata that can be dated has zero relevance to whether or not it was living. Tools made from rock can be placed in a certain range because they are found between two strata that can be dated radiometrically.\n \nIt also assumes that EVERY object is obtaining these Carbons at that exact same rate.\nObtaining what \"Carbons?\" Only one method of radiometric dating uses carbon, that is carbon-14 dating. Carbon-14 dating is useful only to date material that was once part of a living organism that had the air as its ultimate source of carbon. Moreover, C-14 dating is useful only to about 50,000 years. Please learn something before you speak. You are making yourself look like a fool. No fossil is dated because it \"obtains Carbons.\" And you started so well by explaining that fossils are dated by the igneous layers above and below them before you relapsed into the dismal ignorance of \"obtains Carbons at the same rate.\" C-14 dating relies on the fact that the object being dated has not been completely fossilized, i.e., there is still some organic carbon remaining.\n \nIn the same way that a piece of meat retains the seasons of the marinate, the fossil would retain some elements of the material surrounding it.\nBut as you explained, fossils aren't dated so any \"marinate\" [sic] is irrelevant. A fossil is essentially rock in which all of the organic compounds (including the carbon) has been replaced by minerals from ground water. I guess you've never held a real fossil in your hand and been amazed at how heavy it is compared to a similar sized bone. The reason is that it's not a bone but a rock. And, of course, that rock is undatable.\n \nYes, thank you for taking us through 9th grade Bio. However the timeline of decomposition is long enough that one generation over laps the next, I think that is simple enough.\nAbsolute nonsense. As J.B.S. Haldane once said, God has an inordinate affection for beetles. I think he also had great affection for ants and maggots. This year I have encountered 3 dead birds in my yard. They vanished in less than a week. I have also encountered 4 or 5 dead birds in a park where I walk every day. They also vanished. In all cases it was little by little, swarmed by ants, maggots, beetles, and other insects every day until there was nothing left. Your explanation is perhaps just a bit too simple. Perhaps a reality check is in order. I also watched a fawn \"decompose\" over a period of time. Some friends and I found it in the woods when it was still warm. It didn't take too long for it to disappear completely. So I wonder, what are you talking about? Perhaps you failed 9th grade Bio.\n \nThere has been considerable population growth in this century. The time period between AD 1600-1800 is considered a typical time to analyze population growth before this century. One analysis found that by extrapolating back, there was only one family in 3300 BC. Another study found that starting with a family at the end of the Flood (c. 2300 BC), the population at the time of Christ would have been 300 million people. This is actually the accepted population at that time. If we start with a family 1 million years ago, and a very low growth rate of 0.01% annually, by now we would have 2.67*1043 people compared to the current 6*109. To hold them, 4.45*1033 (1033 means 1 followed by 33 zeros) planets like ours would be needed.\nSo I was right. You can't do the math. You are just parroting nonsense that you picked up from someone else. Your major problem is that populations didn't grow at the same rate as between 1600 and 1800. It's really a silly and ignorant argument. It seems that you have ignored the mentions in the Bible of famine, plague, and wars, not to mention disease.\n \n You might want to look into the idea that DamEtel told you about - carrying capacity. Human population growth rates have been increased since the 1600s because science broke away from the dogma of religion and has actually been able to increase the carrying capacity of the earth for humans (and many insects and vermin as well - not to mention dogs and cats, stray and otherwise).\n \n Really, Bgdawg. You've got to start thinking for yourself rather than allowing yourself to be duped by mythology.",

Why is it that it has to be either ALL figurative (e.g. assuming no redeemer necessary, etc.)? I mean come on--there are parts thast simply have to be taken figuratively. On the flipside, it doesn't have to ALL be taken literally. Maybe Adam and Even are simply archetypes participating in sin, to show us the problem of sin in the human race. The issue is not whether they were literal or not, but the priciples that are in the account. Certainly people are capable of evil and do it--certainly there is need for a redeemer, IMO anyway.\n \n Regardless, you are getting off topic--this isn't a thread about whether or not OTHER parts of the Bible are figurative or not. It's about creation and evolution, and there is no reason we can't take the 6 days of creation as representational or figurative.

In the typical sigmoidal growth curve used in ecology, the rate of population growth decreases when the population size begins to approach the carrying capacity, and levels off at it. If population size happens to rise extremely quickly, it can overshoot the carrying capacity temporarily, but nature will make an adjustment by not allowing that size of a population to persist.\n \n Now go away and learn some science before spewing out anymore of your ignorant Creationist BS.\n\n \n I haven't seen \"big dog\" admit yet that his argument was completely invalid. Maybe he still doesn't get it. Maybe this will help him figure it out.\n \n Let's see how Bgdawg's logic refutes his own claim! He thinks that the Earth is of a Biblical age (6 to 10 thousand years old). But his own logic shows that to be impossible!\n \n 1) There is a type of bacteria that takes only 20 minutes to reproduce: to double. So let's start with a single bacterium. At the beginning, there are no divisions yet so the number of bacteria is 2^0 = 1. After the first 20-minute time interval, the first division occurs, giving 2^1 = 2 bacteria. After another 20-minute interval we get a second round of division, giving 2^2 = 4 bacteria. After another 20-minute interval we get another - a third - round of division, yielding 2^3 = 8 bacteria. And so on, where the exponent indicates how many 20-minut time intervals - rounds of divisions - have elapsed.\n \n 2) It has been estimated that there are about 10^80 elementary particles in the known universe. That includes every proton, electron, and neutron, in every planet, moon, and star, in every solar system, in every galaxy, in every galaxy cluster: all of it.\n \n 3) Let us assume that each bacterium consists of only a single elementary particle. How long before the bacteria would use up every single elementary particle in the entire known universe? ONLY ABOUT 4 DAYS!!!!!\n \n 10^80 is roughly equal to 2^266. That gives 266 rounds of bacterial division before all particles were used up - even when counting each bacterium as a single elementary particle. Since the bacteria divide every 20 minutes, 266 rounds of division would take only about 3.7 days - only a bit over half a week. \n \n So what Bgdawg's logic actually shows is that the Earth cannot be as old as the Bible says! In fact, Bgdawg's logic shows that the Earth was just created earlier this week!!! \n \n Gotta love those Creationists' logic!",

   "Ringu wrote:\n In any case, both evolutionists and creationists are talking about ideas and inductive arguments, which means that if their premises are true and argument is strong (more probable then improbable), then the conclusion is cogent. But the problem is that none of the premises can be considered true because no one still knows for sure how everything came to be, the gaps in our knowledge of the universe are still large, so we can only talk about evolution or creation in terms of probability. Same is true about belief in God. Naturalists and atheists do not have 100% sufficient evidence against God's existence but they claim 100% knowing that God does not exist. \n \n \n \n Walking-fish:\n Why do you change the subject and start arguing against atheism when the discussion is really about creation vs evolution? You change direction right in the middle of a paragraph. It seems like an obvious attempt to equate evolution with atheism. The evidence for evolution does NOT hinge upon evidence against the existence of God in the first place.\n \n The evidence for evolution involves evidence for common ancestry (macroevolution) and for natural selection as a mechanism (which works at both the macro & micro levels). The only form of creationism that could possibly come close to fitting into this evidence is Old Earth, Progressive Creationism, where God created every organism in the proper sequence to make it look like they shared common ancestors and have genuine phylogenetic relationships with eachother (even down to the same genetic markers in their pseudogenes) - a very unlikely proposition. YEC has already been proven false by radiometric dating (the Earth is 4 1/2 billion yrs old - not 6,000 yrs old) and by the sequence in the fossil record (contradicting the seqence in Genesis where flowering plants precede fish and birds precede reptiles). So the premises upon which evolution is built trumps those for creation any day.",

   "As far as I'm concerned, the greatest anti-creation argument is the speed of light, the constant 300 000 km/s. If the universe is only 6000 years old, then why is we can see this galaxy that is 3 billion light years away? Given that a light year is the distance that light travels in a year, that would mean that the light that we see from that galaxy is 3 billion years old!!\n\n What about the fact that light travels at different speeds in different mediums? scientists have slowed the speed of light down to mere meters per second using a bose/einstein condensate. What if light speed is affected differently outside of the electromagnetic field of our sun?

Perhaps the speed of light is much faster in the vast expances of space where the force of gravity is not as apparent. I have no way to prove this, but I do not think that there is any way to disprove it yet.\nYes there is. The speed of light has been measured in outer space several times by several different methods.\n \n SN 1987 A was one event that has allowed the speed of light about 170,000 light years distant to be measured. SN 1987 A has a ring around it. That ring lit up shortly after the start went supernova. The ring is slanted in its presentation to earth, i.e., the top of the ring is closer to earth than the bottom. The first time the ring was lit by radiation from the SN, and since the star is in the center of the ring, in real time the whole ring lit at once. However, it appeared from earth that the top of the ring lit first, and that proceeded around the ring in both directions until it met at the bottom. The delay was caused by the increased distance the light from the bottom of the ring had to travel to reach earth.\n \n A second time the ring has been lit. This time it is from the shock wave from the SN. This lighting was predicted. It is proceeding from the top around both sides to the bottom once again. Indications are that the speed of light is still the same.\n \n One problem with your logic is that the \"speed of light\" is a maximum speed. There has never been any doubt that light can travel slower than that through some medium, like air, water, glass, etc. In fact, that is what causes rainbows and causes prisms to work. So anything that has an effect on the speed of light in space would tend to slow it rather than speed it up. However, gravity has the effect of red shifting or blue shifting the light. It still travels at the same speed in a vacuum. The expansion of the universe also red shifts the light - it still travels at the speed of light in a vacuum.\n \n So the result is that anything that could affect the speed of light would slow it down. Even if we were unable to detect that, the effect would be to make the universe older than we think it is. We think it is 13.7 billion years old, but if light were traveling slower distant objects would appear farther away.\n \n Certainly you \"...have no way to prove this...\" because there isn't any evidence to support that assertion. However, there is lots of evidence to the contrary. Besides, to presume that the laws of physics vary for no detectable reason through the universe is illogical in the extreme.",
