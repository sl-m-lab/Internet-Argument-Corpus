   "What's the difference between humans and chimps? According to the blowhards in the scientific world for the past 60 years, they said it was genetic mutations. But according to these three articles, including a September 2006 Science article it's cooked food and fire.....you see these things cause our genes to be expressed differently. \n \n http://www.usatoday.com/news/science/anthro/2002-04-15-genetics.htm\n \n \"Certainly the study opens a new way of looking at how we are different from our closest relatives,\" says geneticist Francis Collins, head of the National Human Genome Research Institute. The focus of much genetics research now centers on how gene activity - rather than the mere presence of a gene in a cell - influences the health of creatures. However, Collins takes pains to acknowledge that much of human nature likely has little to do with genes and is more a question of culture and environment influencing growth and behavior.\n \n Now why would it \"PAIN\" Collins to acknowledge that much of human evolution has had little to do with genes and and more to do with culture and environment??????????????????? Why would he care?\n \n By the way....it's not 99%, as the article states, it's 94%\n \n http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa003&articleID=9D0DAC2B-E7F2-99DF-3AA795436FEF8039\n \n \n http://www.planetark.org/avantgo/dailynewsstory.cfm?newsid=35540\n \n We think gene expression is a major part of what separates chimps and humans,\" said Kevin White, an associate professor of genetics, ecology and evolution at Yale University in the United States. \n \n When we looked at gene expression, we found fairly small changes in 65 million years of macaque, orangutan and chimpanzee evolution,\" said Dr Yoav Gilad of the University of Chicago, lead author of the study. \n \n But he said it was followed by quick changes in specific groups of genes known as transcription factors, which control the expression of other genes, since humans diverged from their ape ancestors during the last 5 million years. \n \n \"This rapid evolution in transcription factors occurred only in humans,\" Gilad added in a statement. \n \n The research, which is published in the journal Nature, supports a 30-year-old hypothesis by scientists Mary-Claire King and Allan Wilson who suggested that key differences between humans and chimpanzees might be found in the way they express their genes. \n \n The researchers do not know what caused the shift in gene expression in humans but they suspect it could be due to changes in the environment, the acquisition of fire and a preference for cooked food. \n \n and another:\n \n http://www.whatistheword.com/story/SciTech_725.html\n \n Such alterations drove the evolution of humans, which was fuelled by dietary changes like cooked food. \"If you change when and where genes are active, you are going a long way toward explaining the differences between humans and other apes. Perhaps something in the cooking process altered the biochemical requirements for maximal access to nutrients as well as the need to process the natural toxins found in plant and animal foods,\" Gilad said.\n \n The basic finding of the study brings no surprises. It merely corroborate a theory floated by Mary-Claire King and Allan Wilson of the University of California, Berkeley, in 1975, which said that gene regulation and not gene alterations led to the differences between humans and chimpanzees.\n \n This is what it has come down to. The scientific world is in sad, sad shape. It's pathetic, really.....yet all you anti-intellectuals will soak it up like a sponge.\n ------------------------------",

But according to these three articles, including a September 2006 Science article it's cooked food and fire.....you see these things cause our genes to be expressed differently. \n \n\n Eating cooked food is a change in diet, evolutionary speaking its not different from if you stopped eating leaves and started eating fruit. Its still mutations that are resulting in evolution but the selection process for beneficial mutations includes social things as well as purely environmental ones.\n \n \n\n Now why would it \"PAIN\" Collins to acknowledge that much of human evolution has had little to do with genes and and more to do with culture and environment??????????????????? Why would he care?\n\n That isn't what it says at all, it says he took pains as in he made this point particularly clear. Whilst genes are reacting to changes in human behaviour (which isn't news, there are loads of examples like this. One of the best ones would be how alcohol tolerance varies across the world between cultures who have used fermentation and those that traditionally boiled water) he is making it clear that these behavioural changes are not genetic.\n \n \n\n By the way....it's not 99%, as the article states, it's 94%\n \n http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa003&articleID=9D0DAC2B-E7F2-99DF-3AA795436FEF8039\n The first article is from 2002 and the second one is from 2006, molecular genetics changed massively over that period of time with the completition of the human genome project and the development of new technology. What they would be looking at and comparing would have changed drastically as well, from just the genes in the first case (the 99% figure) and everything in the second (94%).\n \n \n\n This is what it has come down to. The scientific world is in sad, sad shape. It's pathetic, really.....yet all you anti-intellectuals will soak it up like a sponge.\n \n\n Do you want to explain what you think the problem is? You're going to see a much larger change if you start fiddling with the controls than if you were replacing bases within the protein coding sequence - a lot of those wouldn't change anything in the protein, and a lot of the changes to the protein wouldn't have a significant effect either.",
