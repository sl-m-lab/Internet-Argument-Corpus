   "The emergence of lifeforms has two possibilites:\n \n 1) The Evolutionist View: that each animal is a result of changing parts....that these changing parts built from the ground up millions of years ago. I understand now why evolutionists require random mutations and natural selection....it's because they look at life like a kid would look at a tinker toy set. First their theory of life starts with a few straight short bits, then they add some little round connectors, then they add some long straight pieces, then they put a flag at the top. Voil\u00e0! They have an animal! But it starts with the little, random pieces -- billions of them -- and works up from there. And although each piece is in charge of altering the organism, it is not an intelligent piece, but a piece that gets judged by an external entity (natural selection)....and each of these pieces is ultimately what makes the whole.\n \n or the competing possibility is this:\n \n 2) The Creationist View: that each animal started out as a whole....and because environments and life conditions change over time, these changes are reflected in the parts. In otherwords, instead of the pieces being in charge of the whole, it's the whole who's in charge of the pieces. Not only that, but the whole is where the intelligence resides -- not in some invisible external entity.\n \n \n So the problem for evolutionists is this: When you have a group of animals, and you place them in a new enviornment, and they experience a morphological change, this proves that the \"whole\" has power over the parts. If the parts had power over the whole, then the environment could never directly influence the whole...the only thing that could do that is the influx of new parts!\n \n And there's another problem....evolutionists are learning that it's not the genes, but gene expression that spells the differences in animals. I've shown on here how all dogs, despite their widely varying appearances, have the same sets of genes. Here it is again:\n \n http://www.accessmylibrary.com/comsite5/bin/pdinventory.pl?pdlanding=1&referid=2930&purchase_type=ITM&item_id=0286-11970623\n \n I've also shown how race -- phsyiological differences in humans -- are not tied to genes, but tied to environmental influence on the genes. Here it is again: \n \n http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/genomics/1_identity/ninety_nine.html\n \n This is a contradiction for the reason I just gave -- the enviornment should be able to shape nothing, because according to you guys, it's the randomly-appearing, non-environmentally adapted parts who are in charge of making the whole.\n \n And not only that....but to go from the ridiculous to the utterly obsurd...evolutionists are now telling us that it's not our genes which differentiate us from chimps -- but how our genes are expressed!....how's that for vague??\n \n http://www.sciam.com/missing_control.cfm?oref=http://www.christiandiscussionforums.org/v/showthread.php?t=40778&redirectused=/missing.cfm\n \n Based on that figure, experts proposed that humans and chimps have essentially the same genes, but differed in when and where the genes turn on and off.\n \n and get this....their explanation of how our genes got to express themselves differently:\n \n http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/420427/gene_regulation_separates_humans_from_chimps/\n \n We think gene expression is a major part of what separates chimps and humans,\" said Kevin White, an associate professor of genetics, ecology and evolution at Yale University in the United States. \n \n The researchers do not know what caused the shift in gene expression in humans but they suspect it could be due to changes in the environment, the acquisition of fire and a preference for cooked food. \n \n These guys have truly lost it.\n \n \n So one of the biggest problems evolutionists have is trying figure out exactly what it is that makes a human a human or a mouse a mouse...(or chimp a chimp.) It's proving to be impossible, in fact....which is driving them nuts! And it's particularly frustrating to them because in the process of learning they have no clue about human evolution, they're also learning that it's not the changing parts that make the whole (as evolutionists have always led us to believe), but the whole that makes changing parts! This concept invalidates the fossil record by showing that changes in form are not directly tied to genes and/or ancestry -- instead merely to environmental conditions -- but it also invalidates the whole theory of evolution.\n \n Sorry guys, you lose.",

   "So the problem for evolutionists is this: When you have a group of animals, and you place them in a new enviornment, and they experience a morphological change, this proves that the \"whole\" has power over the parts. If the parts had power over the whole, then the environment could never directly influence the whole...the only thing that could do that is the influx of new parts!\n\n supersport would have you believe that this is always or almost always true, but it is certainly not. Evolutionary theory does not say that the environment has no effect on an organism; the theory embraces and explains phenotypic plasticity. supersport is yet again malevolently lying to promote his fantasy.\n In an earlier thread, sport was making the case that polar bears transported to temperate climate would birthe what are essentially American brown bears, due to genetic similarity and phenotypic plasticity. Here's a picture of a Detroit-born polar bear cub, looking very polar beary, and here's a nice picture of one from Chicago. They don't look very dark, do they? (Oh look, here's yet another bright white Brookfield cub...)\n \n \nAnd there's another problem....evolutionists are learning that it's not the genes, but gene expression that spells the differences in animals.\n\n More malevolent misrepresentation. It is true that expression spells some of the differences, but differences in genes are overwhelmingly pertinent.\n \n \nI've shown on here how all dogs, despite their widely varying appearances, have the same sets of genes.\n\n I've already busted supersport on lying about this article, but it seems that shameless hacks don't really care about reality. The article clearly states that every breed of dog has \"the same basic set of genes,\" which is a far cry from saying that every canine gene is possessed by every dog of every breed. We could also say that humans and orangutans have the \"same basic set of genes,\" but that is also not saying that we are genetically identical.\n I have since proposed The Chihuahua Challenge to supersport. I would be happy for him to take up the original challenge of crossing a Chihuahua with a Great Dane and producing Chihuahuas by raising them accordingly, but he could also take a simpler challenge of breeding a pedigreed Chihuahua male and a pedigreed Chihuahua female and producing Great Dane puppies based on environment (or the other way around: Chihuahuas from Great Dane parents). So far, supersport has scampered away from this challenge like a scared little puppy...\n \n \nI've also shown how race -- phsyiological differences in humans -- are not tied to genes, but tied to environmental influence on the genes.\n\n I don't know what supersport has been smoking, but it must be some high-quality stuff. This is the only thing from his link that is even remotely related to his claim:Additionally, much of our individuality has nothing to do with genes and instead develops from our unique experiences.\nWhile the page as a whole emphasizes that race has no biological basis -- which has not been disputed in scientific circles for some years now -- this says nothing about physiological differences. I personally read that line as saying that our behavior as individuals is largely determined not by our genetic makeup but by our experience. The fact that the line says \"nothing to do with genes\" I think supports my point.\n \n \nevolutionists are now telling us that it's not our genes which differentiate us from chimps -- but how our genes are expressed!....how's that for vague??\n\n Putting supersport's misunderstanding aside for a moment, scientists don't generally go out of their way to make findings understandable for the scientifically illiterate. That supersport doesn't understand the article only speaks to his infamiliarity with genetics.\n \n With his first (Scientific American) link broken, we can only go by his second; however, the second does nothing to support his point when coupled with only the slightest understanding of biology.\n \nThe researchers do not know what caused the shift in gene expression in humans but they suspect it could be due to changes in the environment, the acquisition of fire and a preference for cooked food.\n\n supersport reads this as saying that fire and food induced the changes. This is not what the article is saying. The regulatory genes changed, and the suspicion is that changes in diet made these changes advantageous; therefore those changes were selected for. Notice, however, that this explanation is admitted speculation.\n \n \nSo one of the biggest problems evolutionists have is trying figure out exactly what it is that makes a human a human or a mouse a mouse...(or chimp a chimp.)\n\n This is no more a \"problem\" for \"evolutionists\" than it is for biological taxonomy as a whole, but that doesn't mean that taxonomy is impossible, or that biology is a sham. There are at least three different species concepts floating about in the world of biology. The fact that some organisms are so closely related to others is a prediction of -- not contrary to -- evolutionary theory. Creationism makes no such prediction.\n \n \nSorry guys, you lose.\n\n sport's been saying this for years. See above to be sure that supersport has no clue.\n Creationists have been saying this for nearly 150 years. Take a look at scientific literature. See how much progress they've made? You don't? That's because there's nothing to see...",

   "Electrolight-weight........\n \n You are playing with semantics. I have given you multiple links confirming that it is not the genes themselves that dictate traits, but the way they are expressed. It doens't matter if the genes are \"exactly\" the same or \"similar.\" Your assertion that dogs are not \"genetically identical' is pointless. The reality is that genes do NOT dictate traits. So in some cases genes may be the the exact same, in other cases they may be similar...or in other cases they may be completely different.......but that is not the point. The point is that genes don't dictate phenotypes....gene expression does. \n \n \n But it is true that very often the same exact gene -- or genes -- dictates enitrely different traits based on environmental cues. The DNA, for example, in your fingernails is identical to the DNA in your hair...and that is identical to the DNA in your blood....but fingernails, hair, and blood are clearly very different structures even though they contain identical DNA. The difference, of course, is the result of gene expression. That is, there are regulatory processes that determine which genes in DNA will be expressed in the various cells, based on where they are physically located in the body. Another example, the DNA in a butterfly is the same as the DNA in a caterpillar, but different genes are expressed in different phases of its life cycle. I could give you more examples, I just don't have time at the moment. But what does the following statement mean to you? \n \n Massimo Pigliucci: \"Genes by themselves do literally nothing. Organisms do not begin with a bunch of genes that generate everything else: they need a set of environmental conditions . . .\" \n \n Still don't believe it....? Look what Sean Carrol has to say:\n \n http://www.vardaman.com/frid/fridrep102105.php\n \n \"Evo devo's first big finding is that all animals are built from essentially the same genes...All animals have Hox genes, and nearly all animals use their Hox genes to determine which appendage should go where along the axis that runs from head to tail. Given that the major animal groups, among them arthropods (now including insects), mollusks (snails), annelids (worms), and chordates (human beings), were in place at the start of the Cambrian period, Hox genes must be at least half a billion years old...\n \n \"...Carroll calls these the 'tool kit' genes, and they're the central characters in his story. Nearly all tool-kit genes are present in all animals, and they do much the same thing in all animals. The same gene, for example, that triggers eye development in fruit flies also triggers eye development in mice...Similarly, a gene that affects pigmentation in birds like the chicken and the bananaquit also affects pigmentation in mammals like the jaguar and you. Indeed, changes in bird-plumage color often involve the same gene that causes red hair in humans. This surprising genetic conservatism across nearly all animals is evo devo's key empirical finding: swans, swallowtails, and socialites are all built from the same genes...\n \n \"The real excitement about evo devo, however, has to do with its third claim. Carroll and others have taken the next, and by far the most radical, step and argue that evolution is mostly a matter of throwing these switches.\n \n \"Evo devo's emphasis on switch-throwing represents a profound departure from evolutionary biology's long obsession with genes. Animal evolution works not so much by changing genes, Carroll maintains, but by changing when and where a conserved set of genes is expressed. In the lingo, evolution is regulatory (involving patterns of gene expression), not structural (involving the precise proteins coded by genes). You can think of this distinction in terms of those light switches.\n \n So tell me, electro....are you going along with this \"profound departure\"???...or are you going to continue closing your eyes, holding your hands over your ears, playing dumb and living in the dark ages?\n \n \n And I could care less that science embraces phenotypic plasticity....they have no choice!!! But how do they explain it when a snail is placed in the presence of a crab and it grows right before their eyes? How is that done without intelligence? How is that done if the \"whole\" is not in charge of the parts??? \n \n electro: It is true that expression spells some of the differences, but differences in genes are overwhelmingly pertinent.\n \n Sean Carrol: Animal evolution works not so much by changing genes, Carroll maintains, but by changing when and where a conserved set of genes is expressed\n \n Sorry you lose again.",

I said,The article clearly states that every breed of dog has \"the same basic set of genes,\" which is a far cry from saying that every canine gene is possessed by every dog of every breed.\nThis is your contention: that every dog has a genetic makeup capable of making it another breed, because they all have the same basic set of genes. You have, however, once again avoided The Chihuahua Challenge yet again. Put up or shut up.\n \n \nSo in some cases genes may be the the exact same, in other cases they may be similar...or in other cases they may be completely different.......but that is not the point. The point is that genes don't dictate phenotypes....gene expression does.\n\n Please explain to us how expression of completely different genes can lead to the same phenotype.

Put up or shut up.\n \n \nBut it is true that very often the same exact gene -- or genes -- dictates enitrely different traits based on environmental cues.\n\n I'm not denying that differentiation doesn't occur, and I'm not denying that plasticity doesn't exist. For you to present them together reeks of inappropriate association. But you obviously don't know any better.\n \n Where is the Pigliucci quote from? You bring it up, but there's no citation anywhere. Why should we believe a confirmed quote-miner when you can't cite the source? Even if we assume that he actually said that, we need to know what else he said; you (or whoever you stole it from) cut off the sentence, so we can be sure there's more. Put up or shut up.\n \n \nSo tell me, electro....are you going along with this \"profound departure\"???...or are you going to continue closing your eyes, holding your hands over your ears, playing dumb and living in the dark ages?\n\n Yes, please accuse me of playing dumb and ignoring things. Look at what you emphasized both with underline and with bolding:Animal evolution works not so much by changing genes, Carroll maintains, but by changing when and where a conserved set of genes is expressed.\nFirst, I find it funny that supersport can take Carroll, author of Endless Forms Most Beautiful (which happens to be a favorite of those evil, evil conspirators over at IIDB) and somehow believe that it supports supersport's version of near-Lamarckism.\n Second, I'll only bother to briefly touch on that which supersport's willful ignorance blinded him to: \"conserved set of genes.\" Carroll is not saying that there is little or no meaningful change in genetic makeup, all he's saying is that hox genes are a significant part of animal evolution. supersport would do well to read up on it instead of getting off on the spoon-feeding he's getting from quote mining.\n \n \nHow is that done without intelligence?\n\n How does a base react with an acid? Intelligence? No, chemistry. Biochemistry is a bit more elaborate, but it's still just chemistry.\n \n \nSorry you lose again.\n\n You have a strange definition of \"lose.\"",

The biggest example of this is the chimp genome that was recently sequenced - whilst we have a different number of chromosomes we can see that if you were to place two of ours back to back they would very closely resemble one of the chimps. Its exactly the sort of thing we expected had chimps and humans evolved form a common ancestor.\n \n As I mentioned in the gene expression posts on the other thread, the discovery of alternative splicing explains how an organism can differ greatly in phenotype but still share a remarkable amount of DNA - we can then test this further with proteomic techniques (genome is the complete set of DNA an organism has, the proteome is the complete set of proteins an organism has) support this theory as well.\n \n The approachs have changed in biology as what would have been considered unreasonable is now standard, however I'd say its filled in the gaps and potential complications with evolution rather than pointed us towards something else - at the very most its just enabled us to look at the bigger picture a little more easily rather than having to concentrate on genes alone.",

I understand now why evolutionists require random mutations and natural selection....it's because they look at life like a kid would look at a tinker toy set. First their theory of life starts with a few straight short bits, then they add some little round connectors, then they add some long straight pieces, then they put a flag at the top. Voil\u00e0! They have an animal! But it starts with the little, random pieces -- billions of them -- and works up from there. And although each piece is in charge of altering the organism, it is not an intelligent piece, but a piece that gets judged by an external entity (natural selection)....and each of these pieces is ultimately what makes the whole.\n \n or the competing possibility is this:\n \n 2) The Creationist View: that each animal started out as a whole....and because environments and life conditions change over time, these changes are reflected in the parts. In otherwords, instead of the pieces being in charge of the whole, it's the whole who's in charge of the pieces. Not only that, but the whole is where the intelligence resides -- not in some invisible external entity.\n \n \n So the problem for evolutionists is this: When you have a group of animals, and you place them in a new enviornment, and they experience a morphological change, this proves that the \"whole\" has power over the parts. If the parts had power over the whole, then the environment could never directly influence the whole...the only thing that could do that is the influx of new parts!\n \n And there's another problem....evolutionists are learning that it's not the genes, but gene expression that spells the differences in animals. I've shown on here how all dogs, despite their widely varying appearances, have the same sets of genes. Here it is again:\n \n I've also shown how race -- phsyiological differences in humans -- are not tied to genes, but tied to environmental influence on the genes. Here it is again: \n \n This is a contradiction for the reason I just gave -- the enviornment should be able to shape nothing, because according to you guys, it's the randomly-appearing, non-environmentally adapted parts who are in charge of making the whole.\n \n And not only that....but to go from the ridiculous to the utterly obsurd...evolutionists are now telling us that it's not our genes which differentiate us from chimps -- but how our genes are expressed!....how's that for vague??\n \n and get this....their explanation of how our genes got to express themselves differently:\n \n The researchers do not know what caused the shift in gene expression in humans but they suspect it could be due to changes in the environment, the acquisition of fire and a preference for cooked food. [/COLOR]\n \n These guys have truly lost it.\n \n \n So one of the biggest problems evolutionists have is trying figure out exactly what it is that makes a human a human or a mouse a mouse...(or chimp a chimp.) It's proving to be impossible, in fact....which is driving them nuts! And it's particularly frustrating to them because in the process of learning they have no clue about human evolution, they're also learning that it's not the changing parts that make the whole (as evolutionists have always led us to believe), but the whole that makes changing parts! This concept invalidates the fossil record by showing that changes in form are not directly tied to genes and/or ancestry -- instead merely to environmental conditions -- but it also invalidates the whole theory of evolution.\n \n\n \n This is a brilliant post. Supersport continues to punch holes into evolution.\n \n But I asked before to you, Supersport, what are the implications from your POV? \n \n There are many trying to discredit your facts and research, but I think you have good ideas. \n \n I am hoping that you will reply.\n \n *Sorry to be a newbie.

I had to remove all the URLs in order to reply as a nooby.\n\n \n Thanks! Well since Darwinism is 100% false and the fossil record does not reflect changes in gene pools, but instead merely changes in enviornmental conditions, this pretty much puts the concept of evolution from lower life forms to bed. The reality is we are not evolving upwards, we are devolving downwards. Our genomes are not building upwards towards higher complexity, they are quickly spiraling downwards towards genomic destruction. This is seen in society today by all the diseases that are striking people at younger and younger ages. \n \n \n If the evidence is looked at closely and through eyes of logic it validates what is said Genesis. I am not versed on ages of the earth or ages of the universe but I am 100% confident that life has not been on earth for millions of years. How many years, I don't know...but it's certainly nowhere near what evolutionists say.\n \n One thing you may find interesting is this: evolutionists say that animals evolve new traits randomly....and that it takes thousands, if not millions of years for populations to evolve. The alternative would be that the evolution of new traits happens very rapidly...as in one or just a few generations. So knowing this..... it's very interesting that evolutionists could very easily refute the alternative by doing some simple experiments on animals.....such as this:\n \n Take a two groups of the same types of dogs to different locations in the world...let's say one group of dogs to somewhere in the arctic north...and another group of dogs to some desert-like conditions. They should make sure that the dogs were well-cared for, yet did not interbreed with any local dogs. Then, simply let the dogs breed for a few generations and see what happens to the offspring. If the offspring start emerging with new, unique traits in the different locations, (ie...longer hair, thicker skin in the colder areas) then the theory of evolution is effectively falsified. If there is no change in traits between the populations after a few generations the alternative is falsified and their theory would be vindcated. \n \n This theory doesn't have to be done with dogs.....it could be done with bugs, mice, rabbits, crickets, or virtually anything else. It could even be done in the lab.\n \n but you know what ---- this has never been done. NEVER. Can you believe that? there have been no such studies in the history of science. And if there have been any done, nobody has been able to point me to one.\n \n Isn't that nuts? These people are phonies to the core. They don't engage in real science, in fact, they react badly to it. They have ditched the study of real organisms and how they react in their environment and instead chosen to stick their noses in bacteria viruses under a microscope -- things they know most people have no clue about.\n \n Science is indeed a joke -- yet it's presented as Gospel. Science has effectively replaced the church, with scientists being the untouchable \"preachers\" who have been granted the right of telling us not only who we are, but where we came from and where we are going. But it's all a sham based on an elaborate hoax.",

(non-pedigree) Cats are exactly the same in northern queensland as they are in scotland, likewise with dogs across the whole stretch of America. If you took a sample of labradors from all regions of the world you wouldn't be able to determine where they came from from just examining the animal (apparently you can from the 'accent' of the bark or meow though) - and people do this all the time in dog shows. Additionally, all lab mice are pretty much from the same original stock but california mice are again not significantly different as far as adapting to a new climate than english mice.\n \n [edit] Infact, a far better experiment is one that is done all the time, but not specifically to test this theory but its something you could do at school and is far easier than messing around with dogs and cats. Select one colony of bacteria off a plate, grow it up into a culture (so that you've got the progeny of just one individual) - then transfer a sample of this culture onto plates containing an antibiotic that you know the original bacteria is susceptable to it. If Supersport's neo-Lamarckian theory is right then we will see that the plates are completely colonised by bacteria that have adapted to the antibiotic - if random mutation and natural selection (RM/NS) is right then there will be only one or two colonies growing on. You'd probably have to have a lot of plates for the RM/NS to give you a result. Try it for yourself sometime, but you should trust me when I tell you that the latter is what you see - single lone colonies that have become resistant and are genetically distinct from the original stock.\n \n If you wanted to confirm this result you could then look to see whether there are any changes in the genome of the resistant bacteria compared to the parent colony, though this isn't entirely necessary and requires more resources than the simple things the experiment would. \n \n \nThanks!

You're theory still reaches exactly the same conclusion as darwinian evolution does when it looks at the fossil record - however where the former says that over millions of years natural selection has shaped the organisms we see today out of those primative forms, you're theory says that those ancient organisms have adpated themselves to various changing environments in order to give us the forms we see today.\n \n \nThis is a brilliant post.

I know you have. \n \n One of my all-time favorite mythological stories is that antibiotic resistance proves darwinism. This has been the one of the greatest fabrications of the 20th century. I have long questioned why, if antibiotic resistance proved Darwin's version of evolution, that science couldn't prove this same version with real animals........why is it that the proof is somewhere that 99.9% of the population can't see it?\n \n Well now the truth is out: horizontal gene transfer is responsible for antibiotic resistance. You can read about it here.\n \n http://www.trueorigin.org/bacteria01.asp\n \n Evolutionists frequently point to the development of antibiotic resistance by bacteria as a demonstration of evolutionary change. However, molecular analysis of the genetic events that lead to antibiotic resistance do not support this common assumption. Many bacteria become resistant by acquiring genes from plasmids or transposons via horizontal gene transfer.\n \n And this is not just a Christian site saying this....this is widely accepted, meanwhile the \"proof\" of evolution that was promoted for so many years did not get rebuked in the newspapers....nope...it just quietly slithered away -- just like all the other so-called \"proof\" for evolution has done over the decades.\n \n But you know things are really getting wacky when you hear things like this coming out:\n \n http://www.amazon.com/Horizontal-Transfer-Second-Michael-Syvanen/dp/0126801266/sr=8-1/qid=1171744012/ref=sr_1_1/103-6843584-4361466?ie=UTF8&s=books\n \n Horizontal Gene Transfer, Second Edition (Hardcover) \n by Michael Syvanen (Author), Clarence I. Kado\n \n There is no official description of the book, but look what is said below by a reviewer:\n \n One of Darwinism's favorite demonstrations of contemporary evolution is the development of resistance to antibiotics by bacteria. In this book we learn that the most frequent mechanism for this development is the uptake of resistance plasmids, not mutations in genes the bacteria already posess. Even more startling, resistance plasmids often come from dead cells, where they can remain viable. This finding strengthens the likelihood that life from space could play a role in evolution.\n \n weird...are evolutionists going crazy on us try to fit the evidence into their theory?\n \n \n And WW already gave you guys the link to the Woese paper called Biology's Next Revolution....you can read about it here:\n \n http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/biologys-next-revolution/\n \n  This is where you're wrong though, darwinism isn't 100% false, even if what you are saying was true then still its not 100% false as it is just another possible mechanism which also doesn't fit all the evidence (especially not in bacterial examples where it is pretty easy to actually look at the what the mutation has changed). \n \n how is darwinism not false if NS is not causing these new traits? How could any form of darwinism stand?\n \n \n You're theory still reaches exactly the same conclusion as darwinian evolution does when it looks at the fossil record - however where the former says that over millions of years natural selection has shaped the organisms we see today out of those primative forms, you're theory says that those ancient organisms have adpated themselves to various changing environments in order to give us the forms we see today.\n \n agreed..........though many primitive forms are no longer around and did not change into what we see today.\n \n \n There would be some really facinating implications if you could show this to be the case, far more so than just letting you look at Genesis in a new light\n \n Agreed...any environmentally-driven evolution would speed up evolution exponentially....opening the door for special creation.\n \n \n - it would imply that within the cell there is some sort of mechanism that can read and program protein and DNA, that's pretty much the Holy Grail of molecular biology and if such a system could be identified would revolutionise medicine and biotech\n \n You're losing focus...the focus is not on DNA...the focus is on traits -- it's new traits that are obseved in the field and in the fossil record and recognized as evoltuion.....changes in DNA are not necessary for changes in traits...nor for traits to be \"carried on\" into future generations.

But if the theory is correct there can be no holes -- if there are holes, the theory won't hold water.\n \n SS: Agreed...any environmentally-driven evolution would speed up evolution exponentially....opening the door for special creation\n \n  No it won't, there is no reason to expect it to go much faster than darwinian evolution would suggest unless you are telling me the cells are coming up with totally new proteins rather than just tweaking with existing structures.\n \n Sorry, you're sinking back down into territory that is unimportant. Once again we are talking about traits -- phenotypes. Genotypes, contrary to what you guys believe are unimportant. The fossil record reports no changes in genotype....it reports nothing of mutations...it reports nothing of cells or proteins or any of that garbage...the only thing the fossil record reports is changes -- if any -- in physiology. Same thing if researches observe \"evoltuion\" in the field over a period of years....neither mutations or genes or cells or genotypes are seen....only new traits are seen.....and without controlled experiments there is no way to tell how the change happens.\n \n Thus, since evolution is merely about changing phenotypes, a lamarckian style inheritance would indeed speed up evolution: think about, nstead of a population having to wait on a once-in-a-million random mutation and subsequent spreading throughout the population, the population would all evolve at the same time from the same environmental cues. Instant evolution! Of course this says nothing of the fact that if animals change by way of wholistic evolution cued by the environment that bacteria could never morph its way into humans -- thus the whole ToE philosophy from the very core -- including common descent is false.\n \n \n Natural selection is also environmentally driven, and your theory doesn't dispute evolution through natural selection at all - you are just arguing that new traits arise from another mechanism than random mutation.\n \n I actually do dispute natural selection. I agree that it may weed out the runts and freaks, but certainly is not creative and certainly does not cause populations to drift in certain physiological directions -- the environment in harmony with the organism does that. NS merely weeds out the unfortunate few underperformers.\n \n \n You've still got some big gaps in your theory though, especially if you don't want any DNA to be involved at all (you'll notice I didn't say genes) - where is this 'computer' within the cells modelling protein and other cellular component interactions? \n \n Oh DNA is there -- it just doesn't define us. Life controls DNA...DNA doesn't control life. This is proven by the fact that much of the genome can be knocked out without deleterious effect to the organism. The genome is fluid and changeable at moment's notice. The answer to your question may never be answered.\n \n \n By what mechanism does the information about the environment travel from the outside, into the 'cell computer' of the appropiate tissue and how does that information then get passed onto the offspring? \n \n http://www.biology.duke.edu/nijhout/polyphenism.htm\n \n This guy seems to give a good explanation.....this is about insects but the concept is logical:\n \n It appears that in the control of polyphenic development, hormones act as stimuli that induce discrete switches in developmental pathways. There is independent regulation of the pattern of hormone secretion, of tissue receptivity to the hormone, and of the developmental response of each tissue to the hormone. Because hormone secretion is regulated by the central nervous system, this mechanism allows development to become responsive to environmental variables. Variation in tissue sensitivity to the hormones allows the developmental switch to produce alternative phenotypes in response to specific environmental signals. This is interesting from an evolutionary perspective because genetic variation in the signal and the response mechanisms provide the basis for the evolution of adaptive developmental responses to environmental contingencies. \n \n You've got a hypothesis, you've not got a working theory yet.\n \n The thoery is that the whole is in charge of the parts....changes in parts are directed from the organism's interaction with the enviornment. To say that variation arises from chance mutation defies not only rationality but all laws of nature. Every effect we see in this world demands a cause. To give random mutations credit for everything we see would be giving them a free ride that nothing else in the universe has been given. All causes have effects and all effects have causes. Not only that but common sense says that anything that is created cannot be superior to its creator......the random mutation is hardly superior to what it has created. Even if you combine random mutation with natural selection, neither one of them have an IQ...thus there is no way they could have created something as complex as human beings, who are highly intelligent. yet that's what evolutionists have done -- they have elevated the random mutation over the miraculous mind.\n \n thanks for the good dialog.",

But if the theory is correct there can be no holes -- if there are holes, the theory won't hold water.\nThe molecular side of things is interesting actually (but then I would say that;)), and for the most part has supported the more traditional views of evolution - for the most interesting part is what happens when you start comparing molecular dating (i.e using the rate of mutation to predict common ancestors) to the fossil record. You get more or less the same date but always slightly earlier than the fossil record provides - it would seem that most mammal lineages were established during the end period of the time of dinosaurs. Course everything looked like rats then, but hey.\n \n Talking about the horizontal gene transfer - the thing to remember is that these new traits will be selected for just like a novel mutation will be. Its not a whole in evolution but more an addition - think of Darwin's Evolution being very much like Newton's Laws of Motion, they've got it right 90% of the time but when you start looking at some odd cases things get a bit weirder and the rules are applied in different ways. \n \n It might be that which Woese talks about, but it might well be that based off Darwin not having any idea of particulate inheritance and believing that parents traits blended to produce an offspring (despite the fact that this would actually prevent evolution occuring). Sort of like people who complain that Da Vinci is credited with too many inventions when his designs just wouldn't work.\n \n\n SS: Agreed...any environmentally-driven evolution would speed up evolution exponentially....opening the door for special creation\n \n  No it won't, there is no reason to expect it to go much faster than darwinian evolution would suggest unless you are telling me the cells are coming up with totally new proteins rather than just tweaking with existing structures.\n \n Sorry, you're sinking back down into territory that is unimportant. Once again we are talking about traits -- phenotypes. Genotypes, contrary to what you guys believe are unimportant. The fossil record reports no changes in genotype....it reports nothing of mutations...it reports nothing of cells or proteins or any of that garbage...the only thing the fossil record reports is changes -- if any -- in physiology. Same thing if researches observe \"evoltuion\" in the field over a period of years....neither mutations or genes or cells or genotypes are seen....only new traits are seen.....and without controlled experiments there is no way to tell how the change happens.\n Well yes, because the fossil record doesn't contain DNA to test - it is only a record of phenotype. Whilst you may hold that changes to the genome are not as significant as to the system as a whole, you will be struggling to explain inheritance without something like it - obviously the tissue of the womb is not going to bear a lot of resemblance to the tissue of the developing blastocyst, yet somehow the condition of that womb has to be replicated in the next generation if the changes are heritable at all. If they're not then you should be able to get primative creatures back by changing the habitats - since as the cat example shows you just get sick ones, there must be some geniune inheritance of some kind.\n \n \n\n Thus, since evolution is merely about changing phenotypes, a lamarckian style inheritance would indeed speed up evolution: think about, nstead of a population having to wait on a once-in-a-million random mutation and subsequent spreading throughout the population, the population would all evolve at the same time from the same environmental cues. Instant evolution! Of course this says nothing of the fact that if animals change by way of wholistic evolution cued by the environment that bacteria could never morph its way into humans -- thus the whole ToE philosophy from the very core -- including common descent is false.\n I think you're asking a bit much for a whole population to change to a sucessful new phenotype, more likely that they would change to a large number of different phenotypes and natural selection would then take it further. Its pretty obvious that the capacity for organisms to change is pretty limited - we see a large number of conserved forms and quite a few extinctions that would have been prevented if the organisms could adapt over the course of several generations. \n You're also asking for these organisms to be in contact with each other - if they don't adapt identically, which tests on bacteria shows they don't and each organisms experience is going to be different, we're going to hit a snag where the creatures that are doing well won't adapt even if they are just lucky or stronger than the rest. There is nothing that would cause them to adapt to a chaning environment just because everything else is dying - at which point we're back evolving at the same rate due to natural selection.\n \n To try and sum that up;\n RM/NS allows something to adapt drastically to a new environment, whilst your neo-Lamarkian system requires something survives the change. In a twisted kind of way, RM/NS gives a species some preparedness for a change that your system doesn't give it. \n \n \n\n \n Natural selection is also environmentally driven, and your theory doesn't dispute evolution through natural selection at all - you are just arguing that new traits arise from another mechanism than random mutation.\n \n I actually do dispute natural selection. I agree that it may weed out the runts and freaks, but certainly is not creative and certainly does not cause populations to drift in certain physiological directions -- the environment in harmony with the organism does that. NS merely weeds out the unfortunate few underperformers.\n \nWeeding out the underperformers is all it does with random mutation, that is what natural selection is. Neo-Larmarkian evolution doesn't let more things survive, it just makes them more competitive - that grassland can only support 24 elephants, whether that's the top 50% of lamarkian evolved elephants would outcompete the top 5% of darwinian evolved elephants is irrelevant - there is only going to be 24 of them passing whatever adaptions they have onto the next generation.\n \n\n You've still got some big gaps in your theory though, especially if you don't want any DNA to be involved at all (you'll notice I didn't say genes) - where is this 'computer' within the cells modelling protein and other cellular component interactions? \n \n Oh DNA is there -- it just doesn't define us. Life controls DNA...DNA doesn't control life. This is proven by the fact that much of the genome can be knocked out without deleterious effect to the organism. The genome is fluid and changeable at moment's notice. The answer to your question may never be answered.\n \n\n That first bit doesn't really make sense - sure the DNA might be altered but it is still providing the code which allows us to make proteins and store the changes that the environment makes. Organisms without DNA will not reproduce - and that is a big stumbling block you need to explain. All the changes and responses to the environment need to be contained somewhere otherwise they can't be passed on. Cloning and IVF treatments suggest that they are in one cell and that its the nucleus that contains that information.\n \n So far, the current theory of evolution and inheritance do seem pretty accurate as far as information within the DNA strongly affected phenotype - even if its not always that simple (such as genes that are part of a big system) you still need a way to explain these as well.\n \n\n By what mechanism does the information about the environment travel from the outside, into the 'cell computer' of the appropiate tissue and how does that information then get passed onto the offspring? \n \n http://www.biology.duke.edu/nijhout/polyphenism.htm\n \n This guy seems to give a good explanation.....this is about insects but the concept is logical:\n \n It appears that in the control of polyphenic development, hormones act as stimuli that induce discrete switches in developmental pathways. There is independent regulation of the pattern of hormone secretion, of tissue receptivity to the hormone, and of the developmental response of each tissue to the hormone. Because hormone secretion is regulated by the central nervous system, this mechanism allows development to become responsive to environmental variables. Variation in tissue sensitivity to the hormones allows the developmental switch to produce alternative phenotypes in response to specific environmental signals. This is interesting from an evolutionary perspective because genetic variation in the signal and the response mechanisms provide the basis for the evolution of adaptive developmental responses to environmental contingencies. \n\n This is talking about switchs - its never been thought that DNA is the only thing that effects how an organism develops, the environment will play as much a part in the development of that organism as it does when its an adult and running around the place. The paper is not saying that the environment is altering the DNA, the hormones are just selected between a set of potential phenotypes.\n \n Hormones are all well and good at switching between existing options - there are a fair few we've actually tracked and we know how they change gene expression or activate inactive proteins. We've yet to see anything that suggests they can induce something new - there just isn't enough information contained within the molecule, for your system you would need to be producing new hormones all the time updating the system as it experiences new things.\n \n Hormone receptors and not flexible enough to be involved in the adaption computer.\n \n \n \n\n You've got a hypothesis, you've not got a working theory yet.\n \n The thoery is that the whole is in charge of the parts....changes in parts are directed from the organism's interaction with the enviornment. To say that variation arises from chance mutation defies not only rationality but all laws of nature. Every effect we see in this world demands a cause. To give random mutations credit for everything we see would be giving them a free ride that nothing else in the universe has been given. All causes have effects and all effects have causes. Not only that but common sense says that anything that is created cannot be superior to its creator......the random mutation is hardly superior to what it has created. Even if you combine random mutation with natural selection, neither one of them have an IQ...thus there is no way they could have created something as complex as human beings, who are highly intelligent. yet that's what evolutionists have done -- they have elevated the random mutation over the miraculous mind.\n\n Intelligence is only needed if have resources limited to a certain extent. To use a common analogy - evolution by mutation is the monkeys with type writers eventually producing Hamlet. We make small changes to the basic instructions each time, and sacrifice the occasional individual in order for very small advances. In the grand scheme of things, more organisms die than survive and breed so a few extra that don't make it because they had a bad mutation don't count for much. But if the mutation is something that lets you be one of the ones that makes it to breeding then the effort to get there was worth it. \n I think the big issue here is looking at what is actually being used - its less random mutations and dumb luck but taking advantage of the natural order of the universe to sort out what works and what doesn't than trying to imitate that in a model (whether in a cell or your mind).\n \n \n\n thanks for the good dialog.\n\n No problems, you might be interested in reading up a bit about digital evolution and some of the new directions they are taking to develop AIs. Sounds like it is a bit of a tangent but some of the basic principles you mentioned above are quite often used in this sort of thing (and some biotech techniques inspired by them) - human intelligence is good, but quite time consuming - changing a ton of little things at random and then seeing which works out can be done in the blink of an eye on computers. However, the sort of thing that you see biological systems using is something they are aiming for - a system that can react to its environment and improve itself.\n \n Once we know whether this is possible and the sort of methods it uses to do this, then you could look for a similar thing in biology. One of the big problems you've got is that the organisms that it is easiest to work with (bacteria and viruses) favour the 'try a million different things and see if one works' approach because one sucess will out wiegh the cost of failure since they replicate so fast. E.coli will get back its million lost in less than a day and viruses can go even faster.",

   "The molecular side of things is interesting actually (but then I would say that;)), and for the most part has supported the more traditional views of evolution - for the most interesting part is what happens when you start comparing molecular dating (i.e using the rate of mutation to predict common ancestors) to the fossil record. You get more or less the same date but always slightly earlier than the fossil record provides - it would seem that most mammal lineages were established during the end period of the time of dinosaurs. Course everything looked like rats then, but hey.\n .\n\n \n Well can you explain to me, in general terms, which evidence leads you to believe that the molecular side of things points to traditional darwinism? Here's what Michael Denton says:\n \n Each class at molecular level is unique, isolated and unlinked by intermediates. Thus, molecules, like fossils, have failed to provide the elusive intermediates so long sought by evolutionary biology... At a molecular level, no organism is \"ancestral\" or \"primitive\" or \"advanced\" compared with its relatives... There is little doubt that if this molecular evidence had been available a century ago... the idea of organic evolution might never have been accepted\n \n So what evidence might you be talking about?\n \n \nTalking about the horizontal gene transfer - the thing to remember is that these new traits will be selected for just like a novel mutation will be.

The reality is that the phenotype is the object of selection. Selection could never \"see\" any such process. I think it stretches the imagination to conclude that random mutations created HGT. It seems to me that you are caught in the same intellectual trap that electrolyte is in where you have rationalized creation out of chaos. It's a much less complicated notion to believe that this ability is an inate feature of each organism. Your way you'd have to assume that in some point in history that this ability did not exist. This is not logical because organisms, even so-called \"ancient\" ones have never shown to be primitive.\n \n \n \n Well yes, because the fossil record doesn't contain DNA to test - it is only a record of phenotype. Whilst you may hold that changes to the genome are not as significant as to the system as a whole, you will be struggling to explain inheritance without something like it - obviously the tissue of the womb is not going to bear a lot of resemblance to the tissue of the developing blastocyst, yet somehow the condition of that womb has to be replicated in the next generation if the changes are heritable at all. If they're not then you should be able to get primative creatures back by changing the habitats - since as the cat example shows you just get sick ones, there must be some geniune inheritance of some kind.\n .\n\n \n Well like I've said...there's more than one way traits can get passed on. Ultimately I believe the true mechanism of inheritance will be a neo-lamarckian version of acquired characteristics. I believe signals are transmitted to the developing orgnanism from the mother which allow it to emerge pre-adapted. These traits may or may not be mirrored by the parent. Over time, if the environment sticks around long enough I suggest these changes will become fixed, and thus automatically inherited byfuture generations.\n \n I've already explained the other way, which is not really inheritance at all, but more of an enviornmental evolution where traits are generated and carried forward simply by environmental cues. This has nothing to do with DNA or inheritance...just an adaptation to the enviornment. Ultimately I believe the distinction between acquired and inherited characteristics is incredibly blurred and is very difficult to distinguish.\n \n \n I think you're asking a bit much for a whole population to change to a sucessful new phenotype, more likely that they would change to a large number of different phenotypes and natural selection would then take it further. .\n\n \n Whoa! stop the press. Natural selection can only act on random variation. If the population evolves new traits purposefully, then that is where evolution starts and stops. NS can only be creative if variation is random and unoriented to the environment.\n \n \n \n Its pretty obvious that the capacity for organisms to change is pretty limited - \n .\n\n \n Maybe..maybe not. Science doesn't have a great track record for testing these types of things so it's hard to say for sure. I submit that a brown bear is the same thing as a polar bear -- just separated by a few generations in the sun and warmth. who knows what the limits to biological change are without experimenting.\n \n \n \nYou're also asking for these organisms to be in contact with each other - if they don't adapt identically, which tests on bacteria shows they don't and each organisms experience is going to be different, we're going to hit a snag where the creatures that are doing well won't adapt even if they are just lucky or stronger than the rest. There is nothing that would cause them to adapt to a chaning environment just because everything else is dying - at which point we're back evolving at the same rate due to natural selection.\n .\n\n \n I think each creature will adapt to its specific need. If you have earthworms in the ground separated by 10 feet, the environmental conditions may be different...thus they may evolve small changes in phenotypes. There is no need for selection to create a \"fit\" creature....the creature does it himself.\n \n \n \n \nWeeding out the underperformers is all it does with random mutation, that is what natural selection is. Neo-Larmarkian evolution doesn't let more things survive, it just makes them more competitive - \n .\n\n \n Actually, to darwinists, selection --as I said before -- is  the creative force. It is the driving force in evolution because it shapes and molds the random variation. But if variation is nonrandom then the creativity comes from within and darwinism is effectively falsified.\n \n \n \n \nThat first bit doesn't really make sense - sure the DNA might be altered but it is still providing the code which allows us to make proteins and store the changes that the environment makes. Organisms without DNA will not reproduce\n .\n\n \n Yes, but reproduction -- or lack of it -- is the only negative consequence (that I've heard of) that happens when you knock genes out. Science can ennucleate cells -- including their genes -- yet are still completely viable: the still engage in metabolizing food, maintaining regular operations, digestion, excretion, communication, and responding to external stimuli. Lack of reproduction is the only thing it can't do without its genes. Genes do not control the actions of the body -- the body controls the action of the genes. Genes cannot turn themselves On or Off -- they need an internal or external environmental cue for that.\n \n \n \nThis is talking about switchs - its never been thought that DNA is the only thing that effects how an organism develops, the environment will play as much a part in the development of that organism as it does when its an adult and running around the place. The paper is not saying that the environment is altering the DNA, the hormones are just selected between a set of potential phenotypes.\n .\n\n \n I did not claim they were talking about DNA. We're talking about evolution of new traits right? A change in DNA is not necessary for this. Here is what you asked:\n \n By what mechanism does the information about the environment travel from the outside, into the 'cell computer' of the appropiate tissue and how does that information then get passed onto the offspring?\n \n In reality I don't really need to show how this happens just like I don't need to show you how your fingers go about typing on the keyboard when your brain commands it. All that needs to be shown is that it actually happens on the outside -- it's the phenotypic effect that's important. As far as inheritance goes, I talked about those options earlier. \n \n \n \nIntelligence is only needed if have resources limited to a certain extent. To use a common analogy - evolution by mutation is the monkeys with type writers eventually producing Hamlet.

I'm not getting into this now, but this is a basic concept that separates the two camps. For me, the concept that the whole rules over the parts without intelligence is impossible, while it's equally impossible that the billions of parts in the body rule over the whole.

You could argue that the structure of ribosomes and the discovery of ribozymes disagree with this - but this would be more a abiogenesis thing rather than an evolution thing.\n \n The evidence I'm talking about would be the molecular dating and the fact that the further apart two organisms are thought to be, evolutionary speaking, the more differences between their DNA. If the DNA didn't play a large role in inheritance we wouldn't expect to see that - we would expect to see no changes in similar organisms and then an equally wide range of differences between different ones. We wouldn't have mice and humans being more closely related than humans and fish. Also the chimp chromosome example where we can match the ends of out two human chromosomes and have something that looks very much like a chimp one.\n Also being able to look at the individual proteins and enzymes, compare them across species and modify them ourselves also backs up darwinian evolution - changes made to the DNA directly affects the proteins and we can see that proteins who's roles haven't changed are much more highly conserved than those that have - for example those involved in generating energy within the mitochondria are more or less identical regardless of species, however if we look at those involved in the various types of vision they can differ wildly.\n \n \n\n I don't believe that is correct. The reality is that the phenotype is the object of selection. Selection could never \"see\" any such process. I think it stretches the imagination to conclude that random mutations created HGT. It seems to me that you are caught in the same intellectual trap that electrolyte is in where you have rationalized creation out of chaos.

This is not logical because organisms, even so-called \"ancient\" ones have never shown to be primitive.\n \n\n I think you misunderstand me here, I was saying that the result of HGT is selectable rather than the process itself. It doesn't matter how a bacteria became resistant to antibiotics, whether it was a novel mutation, HGT or some scientist adding it in - that resistance can then be selected for. \n \n \n\n Well like I've said...there's more than one way traits can get passed on. Ultimately I believe the true mechanism of inheritance will be a neo-lamarckian version of acquired characteristics. I believe signals are transmitted to the developing orgnanism from the mother which allow it to emerge pre-adapted. These traits may or may not be mirrored by the parent. Over time, if the environment sticks around long enough I suggest these changes will become fixed, and thus automatically inherited byfuture generations.\n \n To some degree you are certainly right. We know that the conditions within the womb and the chemistry within the mother's blood can have a huge effect on a developing child hence why cigarettes carry warnings on them and why expectant mothers are told to avoid alcohol and a lot of drugs. Its not just negative things either, the babies immune system is shaped by the mothers as well which allows it to adapt a little bit to the outside world.\n \n However, as soon as we leave mammals then this gets a little more complicated as with a lot of fish and amphibians there is no contact with the parents - fertilisation and development occur outside their bodies. If these creatures can only get stimulus from the environment then surely you're only going to have the 'ancestral toad' coded for in the genes. The problem with Cane Toads in Australia is a good example here of an introduced animal that doesn't get a chance to be influenced by its parents during development still keeping its form rather than adopting one from its new environment. Something more than just environmental clues must be involved.\n \n \n\n Whoa! stop the press. Natural selection can only act on random variation. If the population evolves new traits purposefully, then that is where evolution starts and stops. NS can only be creative if variation is random and unoriented to the environment.\n\n If I set a group of engineers or programmers a problem, its unlikely that their solutions would each be identical. I don't see why a population of organisms that are intentionally adapting themselves to an environment would be any different from the engineers - some are going to come up with better solutions than others, especially if they start getting selected on something they've not encountered yet (say they live on a secluded forest island and have been making themselves more visible so its easier to attract a mate - the ones that decide dancing or a sudden flamboyant display rather than peacock-like plumage are going to do better when all of a sudden cats are introduced). Selection only requires their to be a variation, it doesn't care how that variation gets there.\n \n Even people who beleive in darwinian evolution won't argue that behaviour can't be selected for and in many cases won't be based on genetics. \n \n \n\n Maybe..maybe not. Science doesn't have a great track record for testing these types of things so it's hard to say for sure. I submit that a brown bear is the same thing as a polar bear -- just separated by a few generations in the sun and warmth. who knows what the limits to biological change are without experimenting.\n\n Even if polar bears could change colour, its only a minor thing (for example they could be like the reverse of siamese cats - the brown noses, tails and feet are due to the brown pigment denaturing at body temperature, only when its cold at the extremities can the brown colouration occur rather than the default white. Polar bears aren't like that though). What the bears won't do is develop wings within a generation or two and fly from ice flow to ice flow rather than risk drowning during long swims as the ice caps recede. \n \n \n\n I think each creature will adapt to its specific need. If you have earthworms in the ground separated by 10 feet, the environmental conditions may be different...thus they may evolve small changes in phenotypes. There is no need for selection to create a \"fit\" creature....the creature does it himself.\n \nAs long as there are insufficient resources, there will always be selection - I've changed my mind actually, you would see a speeded up rate of evolution if animals could adapt themselves intentionally as they would be competing against each others ingenuity and ability to get their new designs out rather than being on a more or less level playing field.\n \n But surely we wouldn't see so animals looking the same as each other in an environment - we would find a lot more variation within populations. \n \n \n \n\n Actually, to darwinists, selection --as I said before -- is  the creative force. It is the driving force in evolution because it shapes and molds the random variation. But if variation is nonrandom then the creativity comes from within and darwinism is effectively falsified.\n\n Mutation is the creative force, its just not directed towards creating anything specific, its just creating difference. Selection is second part that then lets you recognise the useful creations from the disadvantageous ones - its just ranking the different creations mutation produces.\n \n \n\n Yes, but reproduction -- or lack of it -- is the only negative consequence (that I've heard of) that happens when you knock genes out. Science can ennucleate cells -- including their genes -- yet are still completely viable: the still engage in metabolizing food, maintaining regular operations, digestion, excretion, communication, and responding to external stimuli.\n \n You have the link again, had a quite look on PubMed for something like this but couldn't find anything relevant. I have a feeling the case is probably a bit more complicated than this and the range of possible responses is going to be lower than a complete cell, not to mention the lifespan of them. I'll have a read up on and see if I can chase down any further work done in the same vein.\n \n \n\n You know...I think you guys' argument would go over much smoother if you just admitted that the organism had intelligence. I'm not getting into this now, but this is a basic concept that separates the two camps. For me, the concept that the whole rules over the parts without intelligence is impossible, while it's equally impossible that the billions of parts in the body rule over the whole. Something has to give on your end.\n \n\n It would be a wierd kind of intelligence though - that something is capable of redesigning itself and its offspring but be unable to apply that sort of intelligence to its everyday life seems to me to imply that the organism itself doesn't have anything to do with it.",

   "I'm actually not sure what he is talking about there to be honest, I think he is saying something like all organisms use RNA, DNA and protein (which isn't true if we include viruses) and that we don't see any 'proto-DNA' in organisms. You could argue that the structure of ribosomes and the discovery of ribozymes disagree with this - but this would be more a abiogenesis thing rather than an evolution thing.\n\n \n I think what he's saying that there are no creatures that would qualify as something in between something else on a molecular level.\n \n \n \nThe evidence I'm talking about would be the molecular dating and the fact that the further apart two organisms are thought to be, evolutionary speaking, the more differences between their DNA. \n\n \n If I took a snail and compared its physical characteristics to a human, it's pretty evident that these are quite dissimilar. There is no reason then, to be surprised that their DNA might also be different. Since chimps look much like us, it's likely that they will be molecularly similar. I don't see how you can count this as evidence for darwinian evolution or common descent. \n \n \n \nIf the DNA didn't play a large role in inheritance we wouldn't expect to see that - we would expect to see no changes in similar organisms and then an equally wide range of differences between different ones. We wouldn't have mice and humans being more closely related than humans and fish. Also the chimp chromosome example where we can match the ends of out two human chromosomes and have something that looks very much like a chimp one.\n\n \n I think DNA is just an expression of the animal...however when the animal is under environmental pressures it has the ability to re-express itself. DNA is thus able to be manipulated by the body. As far as inheritance goes, I think what I said earlier is probably the case...A cue from the enviornment can make alterations to the genetic program that occur during the development of an embryo....turning genes On or Off...these changes will maintain through cell division...the genes of the daughter cells will have the same state as the mother cells, and, if a new environment sticks around long enough, will become heritable. As far as DNA goes, I'm just not sure it plays that much of a role in evolution other than acting as life's \"hard drive.\" It seems to me that the passing on of new traits pretty much bypasses DNA, and only if these changes get fixed over successive generations will they get imprinted in DNA. I could be wrong about this, but that's what I've put together. \n \n This is some pretty interesting info on a fluid genome....\n \n http://www.twnside.org.sg/title/bad.htm\n \n \nAlso being able to look at the individual proteins and enzymes, compare them across species and modify them ourselves also backs up darwinian evolution - changes made to the DNA directly affects the proteins and we can see that proteins who's roles haven't changed are much more highly conserved than those that have - for example those involved in generating energy within the mitochondria are more or less identical regardless of species, however if we look at those involved in the various types of vision they can differ wildly.\n\n \n I'll have to get back with you on this one.\n \n \n \n \nI think you misunderstand me here, I was saying that the result of HGT is selectable rather than the process itself. It doesn't matter how a bacteria became resistant to antibiotics, whether it was a novel mutation, HGT or some scientist adding it in - that resistance can then be selected for. \n\n \n I'll answer this at the bottom. HGT obviously would be a non-random event, and thus not selectable...which I will soon explain.\n \n \n \nTo some degree you are certainly right. We know that the conditions within the womb and the chemistry within the mother's blood can have a huge effect on a developing child hence why cigarettes carry warnings on them and why expectant mothers are told to avoid alcohol and a lot of drugs. Its not just negative things either, the babies immune system is shaped by the mothers as well which allows it to adapt a little bit to the outside world.\n\n \n Indeed. I think this is where real evolution happens. Development has long been overlooked by evolutionists, but I think the cat is out of the bag. They are going to have to somehow justify long ages required by ToE with the fact that each animal in a given population can evolve at the same time to the same external cues. (see butterflies below)\n \n http://unisci.com/stories/20021/0313021.htm\n \n \nHowever, as soon as we leave mammals then this gets a little more complicated as with a lot of fish and amphibians there is no contact with the parents - fertilisation and development occur outside their bodies. If these creatures can only get stimulus from the environment then surely you're only going to have the 'ancestral toad' coded for in the genes. The problem with Cane Toads in Australia is a good example here of an introduced animal that doesn't get a chance to be influenced by its parents during development still keeping its form rather than adopting one from its new environment. Something more than just environmental clues must be involved.\n\n \n I don't think so. Tadpoles, for example have the ability to remain in their eggs for longer periods of time when predators are on the outside. This way they emerge larger and more likely able to survive. I don't know why, just because eggs are on the outside of the body that they cannot develop in similar ways that life does on the inside. Life's \"code\" has already been implanted in it, and during the process of development this code interacts with the outside world. \n \n \n \n \n Selection only requires their to be a variation, it doesn't care how that variation gets there.\n\n \n ToE is a two-step process. The these two processes are linked and unalterable. The first one says that variation must be random, the second one says selection must be non-random. If either one of these turns out not to be the case, the theory collapses because then it would be shown that the organism itself is in control of its own destiny -- thus instead of populations evolving, individuals would be evolving. This is a basic contradiction of the ToE logic. If individuals evolve, the whole theory collapses. \n \n S.J. Gould:\n \n The central logic of Darwinism requires that natural selection not merely operate, but that it be the creative force of evolutionary change. Selection wins its role as a creative force because the other component of evolutionary mechanics - the forces that produce the raw material of genetic variation - are random, in the special sense of \"not inherently directed toward adaptation.\" That is, if local environments change and smaller organisms are now at an advantage, genetic variation does not produce more small individuals, thus imparting a direction to evolutionary change from the level of variation itself. Variation continues to occur\"at random,\" in a broad spectrum about the average size. Selection must impart direction - and be the creative force of evolution - by differentially preserving those random variants yielding smaller than average phenotypes\n \n In a sense, the specter of directed variability threatens Darwinism even more seriously than any putative failure of the other two postulates. Insufficient variation stalls natural selection; saltation deprives selection of a creative role but still calls upon Darwin's mechanism as a negative force. With directed variation, however, natural selection can be bypassed entirely. If adaptive pressures automatically trigger heritable variation in favored directions, then trends can proceed under regimes of random mortality; natural selection, acting as a negative force, can, at most, accelerate the change. (Gould 2002: 145) \n \n (....) Darwin clearly understood the threat of directed variability to his cardinal postulate of creativity for natural selection. Gould, Stephen J. (2002) The Structure of Evolutionary Theory. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. pp. 137-150.\n \n \n \n \nEven people who beleive in darwinian evolution won't argue that behaviour can't be selected for and in many cases won't be based on genetics. \n\n \n I think it's been shown that behavior and instincts are inherited by lamarckian mechanisms. I think this would have to be the case, otherwise behavior and morphology could never match up over successive generations.\n \n \n \nEven if polar bears could change colour, its only a minor thing (for example they could be like the reverse of siamese cats - the brown noses, tails and feet are due to the brown pigment denaturing at body temperature, only when its cold at the extremities can the brown colouration occur rather than the default white. Polar bears aren't like that though). What the bears won't do is develop wings within a generation or two and fly from ice flow to ice flow rather than risk drowning during long swims as the ice caps recede. \n\n \n Well, I agree it's a minor thing...but most evolutionists would not admit that. They would say that fur color is a selectable trait....that polar bears got their white color because when they migrated north, those bears who happened to to be white got selected. Being a beneficial trait, this white fur spread throughout the population.\n \n tannish-brown polar bear babies in zoo:\n \n http://www.murrayfrancis.com/wildwestern/viewphoto.asp?file=Dsc00019.jpg\n \n \n \nAs long as there are insufficient resources, there will always be selection - I've changed my mind actually, you would see a speeded up rate of evolution if animals could adapt themselves intentionally as they would be competing against each others ingenuity and ability to get their new designs out rather than being on a more or less level playing field.\n\n \n Good for you. Makes sense.\n \n \n \nBut surely we wouldn't see so animals looking the same as each other in an environment - we would find a lot more variation within populations. \n\n \n Whenever you see a population of animals together they almost always are indistinguishable: sea gulls, ladybugs, crickets, mice, rabbits, deer, tuna fish etc. If the animals are living in the same enviroment, traits are likely to be very similar among organisms in that group. This is one reason why I say natural selection on the level of the organism is impossible: indeed there may be slight structural differences, but these differences are not enough to dictates who breeds and who doesn't. Where selection actually works is on the level of the species (or there abouts)...where animals have true and real differences in size, shapes and abilities.\n \n \n SS: Yes, but reproduction -- or lack of it -- is the only negative consequence (that I've heard of) that happens when you knock genes out.

   "I think what he's saying that there are no creatures that would qualify as something in between something else on a molecular level.\n We can't get DNA from fossils though, which is where all the traditional 'transitional forms' are. You can get the equivalent though by looking at protein homologies in related organisms - where one species might have two copies of a gene at a specific place, another species may have one copy of that gene and another very similar protein where the duplicate copy should be.\n \n \n \n \n\n If I took a snail and compared its physical characteristics to a human, it's pretty evident that these are quite dissimilar. There is no reason then, to be surprised that their DNA might also be different. Since chimps look much like us, it's likely that they will be molecularly similar. I don't see how you can count this as evidence for darwinian evolution or common descent. \n \n The similarities extend beyond the coding regions and genes and into the random accumulated XXXX between them - there is no reason why you would expect DNA that isn't ever used to be similar in closely related organisms.\n \n \n\n I think DNA is just an expression of the animal...however when the animal is under environmental pressures it has the ability to re-express itself.

I could be wrong about this, but that's what I've put together. \n \n\n This situation is feasible within the current model of darwinian evolution - some environmental cue switchs a set of genes off or on. Over several generations the local conditions don't change so that any mutations that result in this configuration being switched permenantly on (the receptor that responses to the environmental signal is always 'on') or messing up the other option don't get selected against - and you'll end up at the same place as your neo-lamarkian version with the new phenotype changing from an environment influenced option to a permanent change.\n Its not one of the main mechanisms of evolution (though that you've got a complete gene that is just temporarily disabled and therefore free to accumulated mutations at will, yet could very easily be reactivated can certainly be useful) \n \n \n\n Indeed. I think this is where real evolution happens. Development has long been overlooked by evolutionists, but I think the cat is out of the bag. They are going to have to somehow justify long ages required by ToE with the fact that each animal in a given population can evolve at the same time to the same external cues. (see butterflies below)\n \n http://unisci.com/stories/20021/0313021.htm\n\n I don't think its so much being overlooked by evolutionists but more that developmental biology is a huge field, but one that has very little relevance to someone who specialises in extinct animals. If you're interested more in cell signalling and control of gene expression then you're bound to have encounted some developmental biology in the same way you will have covered some evolution. The butterfly thing seems more to be stressing the importance of a new model organism in developmental studies rather than really looking at it from an evolutionary perspective.\n \n \n\n ToE is a two-step process. The these two processes are linked and unalterable. The first one says that variation must be random, the second one says selection must be non-random.

This is a basic contradiction of the ToE logic. If individuals evolve, the whole theory collapses. \n \n\n We're not dealing with normal evolution anymore so what is required for that isn't an issue anymore. In your case the selection isn't selecting the same thing as in darwinian evolution - the directed mutations are increasing fitness in the same way that selecting the good ones does, however selection is still going to occur as the organisms are being selected for their ability to direct their own evolution. As we see from non-resistant bacteria and species facing extinction - this adaption is far from perfect.\n \n If the adaption is due to some intelligence and based off the experience of the organism I can't see why they would all be the same. Fair enough if you don't think the changes would be major enough, but I think you are underestimating the large effects a small change can have when you look at energy saved over the course of a lifetime in terms of the energy required to produce offspring or the very low survival rates of most things. Being an extra 1% more efficient might double the number of offspring you have survive to breed.\n \n \n Well, I agree it's a minor thing...but most evolutionists would not admit that. They would say that fur color is a selectable trait....that polar bears got their white color because when they migrated north, those bears who happened to to be white got selected.

I don't see how you can count this as evidence for darwinian evolution or common descent.\n\n \n Shared functional genes don't necessarily indicate common descent over independent design, true, but shared non-functional genes do, since there is no reason why unrelated species would be expected to share identically broken genetic code. Molecular dating is performed on non-functional sections of the genome because such sections are free to accumulate mutations without the owner suffering any kind of reproductive or survival penalty. When this analysis is applied to - for example - the broken gene that renders all apes incapable of synthesising vitamin C, we can date the divergence of the ape species (including ourselves) and see that it is congruent with the dates of the fossil evidence.\n \n \nIt seems to me that the passing on of new traits pretty much bypasses DNA, and only if these changes get fixed over successive generations will they get imprinted in DNA. I could be wrong about this, but that's what I've put together. \n\n \n Analysis of bacteria, however, indicates that DNA mutation can do the job all on its own. Patterns of resistance to antibiotics corroborate random pre-existing and inherited genetic mutation - inherited in the absence of any external stimulus indicating that this would be a good idea.\n \n That's not to say that there aren't some very sophisticated evolved mechanisms for environmentally cued gene expression - but what I think you need to recognise is that the existence of instances of chemically cued gene expression does not imply that all possible environmental cues can be detected and responded to in that fashion. For example:\n \n \nThey are going to have to somehow justify long ages required by ToE with the fact that each animal in a given population can evolve at the same time to the same external cues. (see butterflies below)\n\n \n The salient point here is that those external cues are not novel. Those butterfly species have been living in an environment of seasonal variation for a very considerable period of time; sensitivity to the variations within that environment, as the link describes, confers advantages. That sensitivity, therefore, could have evolved very slowly over an extended period of time, possibly as the butterflies spread from equatorial into more temperate climes.\n \n What you would need to do to cause Darwinian evolution genuine concern would be to take a species that has never experienced seasonal variation, transfer it to higher latitudes, and observe its immediate descendents quickly developing a seasonal response that the parent did not possess.\n \n We don't see things like that happening in 'naturally occurring' analogous situations. Generations of coal-miners, for example, where every male ancestor for six generations or more has gone down 't'pit, haven't developed any adaptive qualities for their predominantly underground existence - surely one would expect to see some sort of directed response...? And what about their pit-ponies, equally steeped in Stygian blackness for even more generations, and equally unaffected?\n \n \nI don't think so. Tadpoles, for example have the ability to remain in their eggs for longer periods of time when predators are on the outside.\n\n \n Again, this is not a novel environmental variation, it is one to which the species has been exposed for considerable time. Early-hatchers are favoured in the absence of predators, late-hatchers in their presence - but the best of both worlds is chemical sensitivity to something related to their presence (eg chemicals produced during flight-reflex in the parent). Not the sort of thing that could evolve overnight - but as we've already seen, it didn't have to: predators and tadpoles have coexisted for a very long time.\n \n \nToE is a two-step process. The these two processes are linked and unalterable. The first one says that variation must be random, the second one says selection must be non-random. If either one of these turns out not to be the case, the theory collapses because then it would be shown that the organism itself is in control of its own destiny -- thus instead of populations evolving, individuals would be evolving. This is a basic contradiction of the ToE logic. If individuals evolve, the whole theory collapses.\n\n \n Genetic mutation is random in the ToE, yes, but there's nothing in there to exclude, for example, environmentally cued responses - so long as the genetic components of those responses themselves evolved randomly :)\n \n \nWith directed variation, however, natural selection can be bypassed entirely. If adaptive pressures automatically trigger heritable variation in favored directions, then trends can proceed under regimes of random mortality; natural selection, acting as a negative force, can, at most, accelerate the change.\n\n \n As Tastyfish points out, that's not strictly true. Since every organism experiences different stimuli during its life, some of them less statistically representative or extreme than others, it follows that they would all adapt slightly differently. Selection would act upon those which got it 'most right'.\n \n Indeed, one could hypothesise that a responsive, Lamarckian system of variation could have itself evolved by gradual random steps, it being by far the best solution to a variable environment - with natural selection favouring those whose mechanisms do 'get it right'\n \n Indeed, once could further hypothesise that the glimpses of triggered gene expression we observe in species today is a snapshot of that system coming into being, and that in a few billion years' time it might indeed be sophisticated enough to allow a polar bear to grow wings. How ironic if that were to be the case, and how much more difficult it would be to then discover the evolutionary truth behind it :)\n \n \nI would check this site out....and his book....he describes how it is that the cell is fully-functional, even without its genes other than reproductive abilities\n\n \n Reproductive abilities are, however, a fairly major part of inheritance, wouldn't you agree? :)\n \n It would be really nice if you could take the time to repost the response to my points in that other thread, too.",

Those butterfly species have been living in an environment of seasonal variation for a very considerable period of time; sensitivity to the variations within that environment, as the link describes, confers advantages. That sensitivity, therefore, could have evolved very slowly over an extended period of time, possibly as the butterflies spread from equatorial into more temperate climes. \n\n \n You are working on an assumption here -- not science. You are assuming these creatures have evolved through RM + NS the ability to have \"sensitivity.\" I would suggest that this is not sensitivity, nor would I suggest this is a unique trait to butterflies. Iwould suggest this is how real evolution happens all over the globe. Of course the process of change is not instant in most creatures, thus evolution may take many generations to be completed. David Resnick did an experiment on guppies --- he noticed after 14 generations that the population evolved to a different size...(I don't remember if the guppies got larger or smaller)....so change often is not a process that happens over one generation like it does the butterflies. Maybe even the size of the organism has something to with it. If you notice in that polar bear picture I posted earlier, the bears had turned colors but their other characteristics hadn't changed yet. I think if these bears were to be released into the wild in california and bred for a few generations, the environment would reshape them.\n \n \n \n \n What you would need to do to cause Darwinian evolution genuine concern would be to take a species that has never experienced seasonal variation, transfer it to higher latitudes, and observe its immediate descendents quickly developing a seasonal response that the parent did not possess. \n\n \n I think that's why science has never done that. They don't care to study the whole organism -- they never have. They much prefer microscopes so they can look at the parts, that way they don't have to see the whole organism evolve.\n \n \n \n \n Again, this is not a novel environmental variation, it is one to which the species has been exposed for considerable time. Early-hatchers are favoured in the absence of predators, late-hatchers in their presence - but the best of both worlds is chemical sensitivity to something related to their presence (eg chemicals produced during flight-reflex in the parent). Not the sort of thing that could evolve overnight - but as we've already seen, it didn't have to: predators and tadpoles have coexisted for a very long time. \n\n \n once again you are assuming the same thing as above. The only way to resolve this situation is to take an animal out of its natural environment, let it breed for a few generations and see what happens. I think there is little doubt what the outcome would be.\n \n \n \n \n Genetic mutation is random in the ToE, yes, but there's nothing in there to exclude, for example, environmentally cued responses - so long as the genetic components of those responses themselves evolved randomly :) \n\n \n We could go round and round on this forever. You are assuming, once again, that chaos created order. Not only that but you are making this assumption based on the fact that there are any such mutations that could add physical body parts like arms, legs, kneecaps, kidneys and kidney cells. There is no such evidence. \n \n \n \n \n As Tastyfish points out, that's not strictly true. Since every organism experiences different stimuli during its life, some of them less statistically representative or extreme than others, it follows that they would all adapt slightly differently. Selection would act upon those which got it 'most right'. \n\n \n I don't know how else to say it: ToE states that selection must be creative...if selection is not creative, then it does not drive evolution. Selection may still be involved but it would have a diminshed role...some like to call it stablizing selection. I agree with that.\n \n \n \n \n Indeed, one could hypothesise that a responsive, Lamarckian system of variation could have itself evolved by gradual random steps, it being by far the best solution to a variable environment - with natural selection favouring those whose mechanisms do 'get it right' \n\n \n well, that might be a good philosophy, but I don't see any scientific evidence of such a thing happening.\n \n \n \n \n \n Reproductive abilities are, however, a fairly major part of inheritance, wouldn't you agree? :) \n\n \n yes but the issue was whether or not genes were in control of the cell/body or the body in control of genes. Of course if someone were to cut your testicles off you wouldn't be able to reproduce, but that does not mean your testicles control or make decisions for you.\n \n \n It would be really nice if you could take the time to repost the response to my points in that other thread, too. \n\n \n I'll try to find it. Thanks for the good dialog.",

Recently (two years ago in fact - when our first black lab was ten years old) after having moved to Missouri, we travelled out to Montana (where we have some family) and purchased a puppy from another breeder that has been there for decades. Now, according to your hypothesis, there would be a noticeable difference between them, right? WRONG!! Our new puppy has grown up and is the spitting image of our older dog (now twelve). In fact, the only way that someone not familiar with them can tell them apart is the white hairs our older dog has begin to get on his muzzle, along with their different coulored collars. (There are some small other things that those familiar with them can tell - similar to differences in the way people look, but sometimes even we get them confused if we can't see the collars)\n \n So, two totally different environments, and two dogs that look nearly identical except for age.

   "Well, sticking with the mouse scenario, if you have one group of mice with a change of diet who go on to have their morphologies altered, and then you have another group of mice who might stay on the same diet and experience no change in morphology, how can you say that the change was not a result of the environmental change? \n\n \n **\n I don't.

We both agree that darwinism is false -- which is refreshing, but he does not believe in a Creator. So right there we are bound to have some differenes. But quite honestly I think we are similar in that we don't look at science from the standpoint of defending a particular hypothesis. Personally all I am interested in is the truth. I want to know the answers. My personality is not one of just accepting an unproven, just-so explanation -- especially when it clashes with my spiritual beliefs. Quite hoenstly I don't think we've gotten the truth out of science for the past 100 years, and not only that, I don't really even know who to trust. I'm stuck in the middle. I certainly do not trust darwinists -- they have lost all credibility in my eyes. I do think that many creationists can be trusted, but most creationists don't know the issues well enough to discuss them in detail. But to answer your question, I'm open to what WW has to say, in fact, from what I've read I agree with almost all of it. But you have to realize that any discussion of evolution and/or origins is highly speculative because evolutionists have wasted the past century and have not been in the least bit interested in engaging in real science....thus we are all still in the dark as to many of the specifics. Having said that, I believe we are in the middle of a biological revolution -- which will ultimately prove Neo-Darwinists wrong about just about everything.\n \n Your question about cats' claws is one of millions that could be asked just like it about traits in nature. I would say that if a certain cat does not have retractable claws that their claws must have been used alot, and thus needed to be exposed. Hard to say though. Evolutionists would have a similar difficulty because they would have to say that the trait had a benefit, which caused it to be selected.

   "You would have to be prepared to tell me how in the world such non-functional genes got selected in the first place then. Selection works on the phenotype, so any genes that don't perform a function that results in a measureable difference in fitness could never get selected. This is a huge hole you have in your theory.\n\n \n Oh no, not at all. Look again at the case of the Vit. C synthesising gene:\n \n Many species cannot survive without that gene, because they have no external source of Vit. C. Any destructive random mutation to that gene in such a species would result in the death of that individual, so the intact version of that gene is strongly selected for.\n \n We infer from the ubiquity of the broken version of that gene in all apes (including humans) that at least part of a species ancestral to apes ended up living on a diet so rich in vitamin C (fruit etc) that a destructive mutation to that gene was irrelevant and not selected against. \n \n Speciation tends to be localised, so the most likely explanation for this broken gene being ubiquitous now is that, though it would not have been widespread across the ancestral species in which the mutation occurred, it happened to be prevalent in the locality where speciation took place (this isn't unreasonable when you think about how, in some species, a single dominant male and/or female do most of the breeding in a pack).\n \n That broken gene has been passed down generation after generation, gradually accumulating more and more random mutations, all of them neutral because the gene is never actually transcribed.\n \n We infer common descent because the exact same malformations of the gene are found in all apes, plus extra ones that tell us more or less how long it has been since various species diverged and in what order. Visualise it thus:\n \n A member of species 1 develops the initial random mutation 'A' that breaks the gene.\n Localised speciation occurs, dividing species 1 into 1.1 and 1.2. Mutation 'A' happens to be prevalent in 1.1 and drifts to fixation.\n Species 1.1 later diverges into species 1.1.1 and 1.1.2. Both share the 'A' mutation.\n Species 1.1.1 later develops another random mutation 'B' to that defunct gene. \n Species 1.1.2 also at some point develops random mutation 'C'.\n Species 1.1.1 splits into 1.1.1.1 and 1.1.1.2, which share mutations A and B.\n Species 1.1.2 splits into 1.1.2.1 and 1.1.2.2, which share mutations A and C.\n \n ... and so forth.\n \n When we look at the genetic code of apes and humans, we see that chimps and bonobos have the most random mutations to that gene in common with us, then (if memory serves) gorillas, then orangutans. I might have that mixed up - but you get the point: it tells us in what order the species diverged. It's practically inconceivable that this pattern of shared random mutations to non-functional DNA could have occurred by chance in seperate, unrelated species. On top of that we would have to believe that the transitional fossil evidence that 'just happens' to chronologically coincide with the dates predicted by the genetic analyses is also just a coincidence. I personally find that a bit of a stretch :)\n \n \nI've showed you earlier how antibiotic resistence happens because of HGT, not RM + NS.\n\n \n Actually this has been quite thoroughly tested and proved to arise via RM. The statistical nature of the proof isn't to everyone's taste but it's quite valid. How that resistance then gets passed on or spread will, of course, be a combination of direct inheritance and HGT, in circumstances where the latter is possible.\n \n \nYou are working on an assumption here -- not science. You are assuming these creatures have evolved through RM + NS the ability to have \"sensitivity.\" \n\n \n No, all I'm saying is that they could have. All the examples you are giving of phenotypic sensitivity have things in common:\n \n 1. The environmental variability to which the organism displays a response is not novel; the species has been exposed to that variation for millenia. This means we are not necessarily looking at a rapid evolutionary response, just a genetically programmed phenotypic response - a bit like carrying tyre-chains in the trunk in case of snow. It snows, and bang - everyone's got tyre chains on their cars - does that mean everyone seperately came up with the idea of tyre chains, constructed and fitted them inside five minutes?\n \n 2. We can see ways in which the species could have survived before that phenotypic response developed. Even if butterflies require the adaptability you describe to survive in higher lattitudes, we can hypothesise that they originated at the equator and gradually expanded their ranges as their survivability at those latitudes increased.\n \n We're looking at species that have been evolving - based on every bit of evidence available to us - for billions of years. If something as complex as an eye or a brain can evolve in that time, we should not be too surprised to find subtlety manifesting elsewhere. All I'm saying is that the existence of these sensitive systems is not incompatible with Darwinian evolution.\n \n \nI would suggest that this is not sensitivity, nor would I suggest this is a unique trait to butterflies. Iwould suggest this is how real evolution happens all over the globe.\n\n \n Oh, I know that's what you're suggesting, but there are considerable gaps in what you're asking us to believe.\n \n \nOf course the process of change is not instant in most creatures, thus evolution may take many generations to be completed. David Resnick did an experiment on guppies --- he noticed after 14 generations that the population evolved to a different size...(I don't remember if the guppies got larger or smaller)....so change often is not a process that happens over one generation like it does the butterflies.\n\n \n The explanation for this is not particularly mysterious: there are several mechanisms at work which operate on different time scales. The butterflies have a sensitivity which controls their individual development: they pass on that sensitivity, not the phenotype they were born with. Similarly, Thalidomide is not a mutagen: people deformed by their mother's consumption of the drug during pregnancy do not pass on their deformity to their offspring - but they can pass on their genetic sensitivity to that chemical.\n \n Breeding patterns and sexual selection can rapidly reshape the genetic and phenotypic profile of a population: small guppies breeding more with small guppies leads to a preponderance of smaller guppies in the next generation, a self-reinforcing process. This does not require new genes entering the population and is often quickly reversible should selective pressures change. Most populations have a wide range of alleles and phenotypes ready to be selected for. Very rapid adaptation of such populations is usually characterised by a brief 'crash' where only those best suited breed, followed by a typically rapid return to saturation.\n \n The slowest of all adaptive processes are those for which new genes are necessary. Billions of bacteria and hundreds of generations can be required for adaptive genetic mutation to be hit upon, if an adaptive gene does not already exist in the population. This has been demonstrated thousands of times in the lab.\n \n \nI think that's why science has never done that. They don't care to study the whole organism -- they never have. They much prefer microscopes so they can look at the parts, that way they don't have to see the whole organism evolve.\n\n \n I don't think that's a fair assessment. Like I said, there are a number of processes in operation and to observe some of them, you need microscopes.\n \n \nonce again you are assuming the same thing as above. The only way to resolve this situation is to take an animal out of its natural environment, let it breed for a few generations and see what happens. I think there is little doubt what the outcome would be.\n\n \n But there are literally millions of animals - humans - who have migrated around the world without exhibiting the kind of extreme and rapid adaptation you describe. Yes, we, like butterflies, have our phenotypic environmental sensitivities (eg building red/white muscle according to the demands of our lifestyle). Yes, we, like all animals, are a genetically and phenotypically diverse population, and changing breeding patterns can reinforce those traits, such patterns influenced by migration, which itself naturally tends to filter out those unsuited to a new environment (ie they turn back or stay behind). But if a Chinese person comes to America, and he and his descendents only breed with other Chinese people, they will at the end of the day still look Chinese :)\n \n Nor have any of the domesticated animals we have taken with us exhibited any major adaptation - despite the fact that (depending upon the plasticity of the species) selective breeding can reshape their phenotype in a handful of generations all the while staying in the same environment. That strikes me as a bit of a big hole in your boat :)\n \n \nWe could go round and round on this forever. You are assuming, once again, that chaos created order.\n\n \n With respect, I'm doing no such thing.\n \n \nI don't know how else to say it: ToE states that selection must be creative...if selection is not creative, then it does not drive evolution. Selection may still be involved but it would have a diminshed role...some like to call it stablizing selection. I agree with that.\n\n \n Mutation plus selection is creative; I don't see any justification in subdividing the process. The first half of a production line doesn't make a car, and nor does the second - does that mean production lines can't make cars? Of course not; our mistake in both cases is subdividing too far.\n \n \nyes but the issue was whether or not genes were in control of the cell/body or the body in control of genes. Of course if someone were to cut your testicles off you wouldn't be able to reproduce, but that does not mean your testicles control or make decisions for you.\n\n \n Well, anyone who's had a pet neutered will tell you that it can drastically change their temperament. Testes secrete behaviour-altering hormones, after all.\n \n But your analysis of what is 'the issue' seems forced to me. Is a driver in control of a racecar, or the car in control of the driver? Clearly we would say the former, yet the car is a factor in whether or not he wins races. The driver cannot 'decide' to go around corners at top speed, or fly, because the car does not permit it. Does that put the car in charge? Or is it just a realistic assessment of the limitations the driver has to work with?\n \n I would say that organisms live their lives and genes, through their influence on phenotype, either help or hinder them in their efforts. Organisms can find ways to make their phenotype work for them by migrating or changing behaviour, and can choose mates based on desirable phenotypic qualities, or simply a healthy appearance indicative of successful phenotypic qualities, which may in turn reflect advantageous genetic traits - all of which actively drives speciation and evolution: organisms carrying their genes with them.\n \n Sometimes behavioural change is enough to adapt. Sometimes certain phenotypes will be advantageous enough that natural and sexual selection will gradually favour them. And sometimes, yes, an organism is purely at the mercy of the genes it was born with, as with bacterial immunity to antibiotics.\n \n In your life, things happen that you can take in your stride, things happen that you could have avoided, and things happen that are simply beyond your control. You can dodge a car, but you can't dodge a bullet - that doesn't demean your identity as an intelligent, self-directed organism: after all, you can intelligently avoid situations where you might end up in the way of a bullet. But plating bacteria on phage is the equivalent, in human terms, of a ten-mile-wide asteroid unexpectedly smacking into the Pacific: billions will die and the few that survive to repopulate the planet just got lucky.\n \n \nI'll try to find it. Thanks for the good dialog.\n\n \n No problem.",

These dynamic responses to anything that might or does interfere, or might enhance, our anti-entropic ability to survive, thrive, and reproduce are what separate living things from wind and water and sandy beaches and molecules and other bits of passive, inanimate 'stuff'.\n \n As an example, let's say you forget to water a houseplant. After a bit, the neglected organism entropically begins to wither and die. Its leaves turn yellow and dry, its stems droop and its flowers wilt, and so on on. Then you notice, give it a nice refreshing drink, and after a while, if you haven't actually killed it, it should be back to its old self. None of that is adaptation or evolution. It's just getting what you need, or not getting what you need, to stay alive, thrive, and reproduce.\n \n Adaptation is when you give the plant just a little too much or a little too little water, and the plant learns to overcome the difficulty this presents to its normal functioning. It can either call on its inherited repetoire of internal adjustments, or if this doesn't 'fix' things, it can call on its internal adjustment system in an epigenetic developmental fashion that will allow its offspring plants to do better, and, if the situation persists over generations, insert the morphological and behavioural changes it has made epigenetically \n into its genetic code. And that's evolutionary change. Its all about information, information processing, behavioural and morphological options available, and selection of the best option/s available under these given circumstances.\n \n In short, stimulus is what is done to an organism, externally, and adaptive response is what it does about it, internally. If the organism cannot do anything about it, then it simply dies out, in one generation or a few.\n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n That's my opinion as well, except that, just to be clear, the response is directed by the whole organism insofar as its capacity to harness Vitality, and its current degree of complexity, will allow it. There is no little homunculus seated inside an organism running a set of controls. Every cell contributes to the whole. \n \n \n Well i wouldn't say there is any specific entity in the body either...but then again something is making these snails do this...which I don't think is particularly unusual in the animal kingdom.\n \n http://www.pitt.edu/~jthst21/Hoverman.html\n \n how could this happen without some sort of sensory mechanism that makes a decision of sorts?\n\n \n **\n I have to congratulate you on your ability to find interesting links. I don't know kind of search engine you use, but I wish I had one like it. Or is it simply that I don't know how to 'google' properly?\n \n IAC, the snails are a great example, since they have what might most charitably described as 'rudimentary' brains. Most people still anthropomorphize 'intelligence', and insist that intelligence is something the brain produces. No brain means, to them, no intelligence, and teensy brains means teensy intelligence. Therefore to them, plants, bacteria, etc., have no brains and no intelligence, and crustaceans have teensy-weensy brains and teensy-weensy intelligences. But any kind of empirical study shows, as your link does, that this just ain't so.\n Every cell has 'intelligence', and closely interconnected and interdependent, systematized complexes of cells possess collective and unified intelligence. With some simple critters, the intelligence resides 'wherever the rubber meets the road', and is much less 'compartmentalised' than it is in 'advanced' organisms, like us. I wish I knew more about the experiment, since it presents a perfect test of \"RMNS darwinism\" contra EAM. If snails that survive to reproduce contra predation are not just those with inherited traits that provide extra defense, and if those snails without such benefits produce those 'superior' traits in their offspring, then 'natural selection' is no answer.\n But if only the 'strong' survive, then nothing is demonstrated, or if the 'weak' parents continue to produce 'weak' offspring until eventually they're killed off entirely, then nothing has been demonstrated. Except the trivial truism that the weak don't succeed as well as the strong. But, if the 'weak' start producing 'stronger' and 'stronger', increased predator resistant offspring, then a real evolutionary mechanism is in play. The devo-evo, neo-lamarckian, dynamic mechanism I call EAM.\n \n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n Now you are conflating two qualitatively different situations. With the cats, it's the environment, i.e., their diet, but with the agoutis its inheritance, i.e., their genes. \n \n \n But the organism -- in conjunction with the environment -- has control over/can manipulate its genes....sort of like being flipped like a switch. Genes seem to be followers to external influences. Do you disagree with this?\n\n \n **\n No, except that you seem, by using the expression, \"in conjunction with\", to still want to make 'the environment' an intentional and dynamic player in the process. That is still just plain wrong. The 'environment' simply is whatever it it is, and usually what it is has arisen chaotically. In any case, the environment has absolutely no say over what it is, nor does it have any awareness or intention wrt to its effects on living organisms. The environment simply is what it is, and that is all that it is. It does not work together with the organism to produce anything. The organism works alone.\n \n Only the organism itself has any control over what it does with itself, and the issue is not what the environment does to it, but rather, what it does to itself in order to overcome what the environment is doing to it.\n \n \n\n check out this link...the same scenario I presented is here...except using lions.\n \n http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/liv...urce=&ito=1490\n \n Of course darwinists will call it natural selection in action.\n\n \n **\n Another great link. But there again is the problem with your experiment--no matter what happens, the darwinists will attribute it to RMNS, since both these nebulous terms, apart or together, can, and in their world, do, account for everything and anything. To limit observations to those that cannot be attributed to the tautologous trivial truism, \"the strong survive, the weak perish\",and the assumption that who's strong and who's weak is genetically determined (darwinism in a nutshell), it must be set up to show that the weak can make themselves and their offspring stronger as a result of experience, and not that the weak were simply sorted out and discarded, as per the above truism. In short, it is necessary to show a dynamic, intentional, teleological response, and not the passive, accidental, coincidental, outcome of a non-human, i.e., 'natural', 'breeding' situation.\n \n \n\n I do not think this is possible because lions hunt in packs...and thus, a slightly smaller individual would not be at a particular disadvantage. Not only that, but the population surely evolved same traits -- at pretty much the same speed. Of course this says nothing of the newly-evolved instincts such as hunting techniques. Surely darwinists don't say those thought processes were due to dawinistic mechanisms. \n\n \n **\n Well, actually, they do say that. They just can't prove it, is all. Your objections are good, but darwinists have had 150 years of wriggling round objections, and so they are now extremely good at it. However, if you can treat each pride as a genetically closed system, and show that the overall increase in size was a response to the environment and not a matter of eliminating small cats from the breeding population, you'll make a start. The darwinists still won't accept it, of course, since they'll blame the over-all increase in size on a wayward gamma ray that accidentally hit one of the males' germ cells, 'just right'. Well, OK, three wayward gamma rays that smacked into at least one member of each pride, 'just right'. Duh!\n \n \n\n I think the most logical conclusion is that these cats somehow \"knew\" to grow bigger just like the snails did. Over time, this \"knowledge\" got transmitted to DNA and the trait became fixed in the population. I would guess if the diet changed back to a more typical lion diet that traits would soon follow -- and natural selection would have nothing to do with it.\n\n \n **\n I agree totally. The trick is in getting around the darwinian resistance to that idea, and discovering how the information that the lion-organisms perceived and conceived and incorporated, that is 'learned' and turned to 'knowledge', operates as a psychical process. Since we can't yet explain how it is that we learn that 2+2=4, etc., that'll be a long row to hoe. Meantime it will suffice to show that such things do not happen accidentally, or by some simplistic mechanical sorting process.",

I cannot judge the geologists' long-age claims as geology is not my field. Biology, however, is my expertise and with its recent findings in mind we cannot escape the conclusion that the systems that make life going cannot have not been around for millions-billions of years. The molecular genetic data must therefore by reinterpreted, i.e. the alignment of mutations we observe in phylogenetic analyses are not the result of common descent but rather that of a non-random mutational mechanism. The reason that many scientist converted to long ages is because Darwinism, which requires millions-billions of years, is the officially accepted account of life.\n ----------------------------------\n \n Why, I wonder, are fossils interpreted as evidence for long ages? Because they are of stone?\n \n The new biological facts are that scientists are (almost routinely now) extracting soft tissue from dinosaurs bones. Nobody anticipated on this (why would highly unstable biomolecules be stable for 65 million years) and it was tacitly assumed impossible a decade ago. That's why nobody tried it before. \n \n Why, I wonder, do we have to contineously adjust previous biological truths to accomodate long ages. Why do we have to make consessions to long-age evolutionary theories while the biological data plead against it.\n \n Why do we have to believe that mutations frequencies were low in organisms that lived millions of years ago and high in modern organisms?\n \n I don't see a reason to keep up a long aged paradigm when it is not in accord with biology as we observe it. \n \n If paradigms fail they should be overturned.\n --------------------------------------\n \n \n Fast-track evolutionary schemes as proposed by Davison are okay, as they do not necessary require long ages, but it may be impossible to distinguish between such processes and a creational event. Personally, I belief that socalled multipurpose genomes were created not so long ago with an built-in flexability to rapidly procude new species. This might have been established by a semi-meiotic mechanism or by karyotype fission. Nobody knows, but the mechanism was not a random one. A random mechanism would never produce the required \"hopeful monsters\". Schindewolfs \"monsters\" were generated instantly as is was guided by genetic elements, and as such qualify as instant creations from the multipurpose genome. \n ------------------------------------\n Let me once more summarise:\n \n The new biology shows the major part of genes can be knocked out without inducing a phenotype. This was a big surprise and you could have read about it in Nature a few years ago that the Darwinians do not believe it, as it so obviously falsifies their non-sense (Pearson H. Surviving a knockout blow. Nature 2002, volume 415: pages 8-9).\n \n Genetic redundancies qualify as neutral genes and are thus not subject to selection (or do you want to propose neutral selection, which has been proposed by Svente P\u00e4\u00e4bo's group recently. I wrote him two letters for a little inquiry as I didn't understand what he meant, but, unfortunately he never responded). \n \n Neutral genes can be inactivated any time you like. The no-phenotype is the scientific evidence of neutral genes and they are the rule rather then the exception in real life biology.\n \n These new biology data scream out: \n \n 1) biological systems are designed.\n 2) biological systems are not old.\n \n Maybe you did not get it yet, but I am introducing a completely new paradigm of biology devoid of the Darwinian claptrap. In order to do that I have to falsify and completely overturn the old one. That is how the scientific method works: I am a scientist, you know. GUToB is the new theory that explains all biological phenomena. \n \n I rest my case,\n \n ---------------------\n John, how were the sequences of redundant genes preserved during the alleged millions and millions of years of evolution? Now we know the sequences of the genomes of chimp and human we observe that they have independently lost many of the redundant genes. Even in human subpopulations we observe independent losses of genetic redundancies: ACTN3 and CCR5. Many genetic losses happened and still happen unnoticed as they do not give an apparent phenotype (you won't see the CCR5 'knockouts' in the hospital). How do you explain that? As argued, your PEH does not require long ages: it is instant evolution. It perfectly fits the view of recently created biology.\n \n peebee",

   "Evolutionists believe that traits come from parent's genes.\n Correct.\n \nFit parents have fit kids. Unfit parents have unfit kids.\nA simplistic statement of the situation. It may not be true. In fact, the Grants in their studies of Darwin's finches on Daphne Major in the Galapagos Islands seem to show that the situation is far more complicated than you seem to understand. In their study of 20 years or so, the two longest lived individual birds in the entire 20 years left no offspring that survived to reproduce. If fitness is defined as survival to reproduce, then those two birds were exceptionally fit because they survived and reproduced more than any other individual bird during the study. Both birds were males and both were very successful breeders.\n \nBut that's not what happened in the Pottenger experiment...fit parents lead to progressively less and less fit individuals.\nSure. Malnutrition leads to progressively more malnourished offspring. A malnourished mother bears malnourished offspring. What is so difficult to understand? That isn't inherited.\n \ntake the following example: Say a person leads a lifestyle that gets them cancer or diabetes or depression.\nOK. a person leads a lifestyle that gets them cancer or diabetes or depression.\n \n While smoking and certain other environmental exposures can lead to cancer, and while obesity tends to cause diabetes, I'm not sure where depression fits in.\n \nThen their offspring does the same thing.\nOK. So what?\n \nThe medical establishment seems to admit that diseases run in families....thus, if one's parents and grandparents got cancer, it might predispose them to the same thing.\nBut in those cases the cause is genetic, and many of those genes have been identified. That's why they are known as genetic diseases. They are inherited in a predictable genetic pattern and/or the specific allele of the gene has been identified.\n \nMy understanding is that diseases get passed on not genenetically, but epigenetically.\nThat's just pure nonsense. Duchenne MD is without a doubt a genetic disease. Smallpox was viral, as is polio. MS and arthritis are abnormal immune responses. Please give examples of epigenitic diseases and why they support your view.\n \nAnd I see this as no different in the Pottenger experiment, where traits diseases got inherited.\nBut the disease was malnutrition. Malnourished mothers give birth to malnourished offspring. And as they mature, they are, in turn, malnourished.

   "\n yes that makes sense, but that's staying within the same generation. Evolutionists believe that traits come from parent's genes. Fit parents have fit kids. Unfit parents have unfit kids. But that's not what happened in the Pottenger experiment...fit parents lead to progressively less and less fit individuals.\n\n \n **\n You're right. My bad. My analogy was inappropriate. Yes, I would have to say that something like the cat observations, of increasing degeneration passed from generation to generation, would have to be an instance of epigenetic inheritance. However, since there was no organismic adaptation to the negative stimulus, but only inherited and ever increasing disfunction (entropy), I would still have to say that since that epigenetic inheritance was not an adaptive response, but simply passive deterioration, it was therefore not an evolutionary process. 'Devolutionary' perhaps, and definitely entropic, but since nothing novel or increasingly complex was added to the organisism, i.e., no original 'bio-information', but on the contrary, only old 'bio-information, productivity, and efficiency was subtracted from the organisms, (as biosystems, leading to ever-increasing loss of their dynamic powers and abilities), it cannot, in my view, be considedered an instance of evolution. No more than extinction can be considered an instance of evolution, although the darwinists seem to believe that to be the case.\n \n Oh, and as an afterthought, this is one more proof that inheritance and evolution are not the same thing at all, no matter that darwinists think that they are.\n \n \n \n\n take the following example: Say a person leads a lifestyle that gets them cancer or diabetes or depression. Then their offspring does the same thing. The medical establishment seems to admit that diseases run in families....thus, if one's parents and grandparents got cancer, it might predispose them to the same thing. My understanding is that diseases get passed on not genenetically, but epigenetically. And I see this as no different in the Pottenger experiment, where traits diseases got inherited.\n\n \n \n **\n It isn't different; but again, as above, inheritance, even epigenetic inheritance, is not evolution. Evolution requires an increase, and certainly not a decrease, in a biosystems efficiency and productivity WRT the life goals of 'survive, thrive, replicate'. Which is one reason why entropic failure in a subsystem, eg., the organism's genome, can never lead to anything but a loss of function. There is no way in the world that information, productivity, and efficiency can be _accidentally_, i.e., unintentionally, subtracted from a complex interacting system, and even coincidentally generate an increase information, productivity, and efficiency in that system. For darwinists to claim that accidental genetic mutations can coincidentally generate adaptedness in organisms is utterly irrational. Pure speculation founded in their value-free metaphysic. \n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n No, except that you seem, by using the expression, \"in conjunction with\", to still want to make 'the environment' an intentional and dynamic player in the process. That is still just plain wrong. \n \n \n I just don't see how you can separate the enviornment from the organism -- they both make each other what they are. To put it simply, I would say in regards to the characteristics of an organism, that genetic and enviornmental factors are inextricably intertwined. This starts from the moment of conception and lasts for as long as the organism is alive.\n \n \"The mind and the world arise together\" Goethe\n\n \n **\n Whatever Goethe may mean by that, ( I haven't studied 18th-19th century German Romanticism), but I doubt that it applies as you think it does.\n \n I can separate the environment from the organism in the same way way that that I can separate anything that \"is\", from that which it \"is not\". The external world can act upon a living biosystem, but in cannot work \"with\" it. A falling stone can kill you, or be a tool you use to crack a nut. Even as a tool the stone is merely an extension of your intelligence and will. It has none of its own, so it will never be your partner, but only whatever you make of it.\n \n Of course, being material as well as psychical entities, living organisms are entangled with the world. That is exactly what adaptive theories of evolution are all about. But becoming \"adapted to\" is not the same thing as being \"adapted by\". A car does not teach you to drive, or cause you to drive, or force you to drive, or suggest when and where to drive, or whatever. Your mind does 100% of all that. Inanimate objects are simply, \"there\", and that's that.\n \n \n \n\n Quote:\n Originally Posted by wascallywabbit \n The 'environment' simply is whatever it it is, and usually what it is has arisen chaotically. In any case, the environment has absolutely no say over what it is, nor does it have any awareness or intention wrt to its effects on living organisms. The environment simply is what it is, and that is all that it is. It does not work together with the organism to produce anything. The organism works alone.\n \n Only the organism itself has any control over what it does with itself, and the issue is not what the environment does to it, but rather, what it does to itself in order to overcome what the environment is doing to it. \n \n \n That makes sense...you've made me come around on the concept that the enviornment \"directs\" anything. How do you like the word \"cue\" though? \n\n \n **\n Cue, impetus, impulse, inducement, stimulus, signal--they are all fine by me, (he said off-handedly). The one word I won't accept wrt the environment is 'cause'. The seat of evolutionary causation is solely in the organism itself, as an adaptive system; not in its environment, acting as something to become adapted by, something that anthropomorphically shapes organisms to suit itself.\n That's strictly the darwinian way of looking at evolution and its causation, (i.e., \"Natural Selection\").",

This falsifies the peppred moth thing where evolutionists give credit to NS for the color changeover in the population. <snip< this actually does contradict your theory because traits are arising purposefully, as a direct result of what's happening on the outside. Darwinists claim that traits arise randomly, only to be then selected.\n\n \n With respect, I'm not ignoring anything. What I'm asking you to do is to consider that the 'evolved trait' here is the sensitivity to a specific variation in the environment - here something associated with the season, eg temperature. \n \n Do you see what I'm getting at? Our irises contract in bright light - that doesn't mean we're 'evolving' smaller pupils. It's an evolved mechanism for dealing with an endemic variation in the environment - a mechanism fish, for instance, don't have. Many dogs grow a winter coat - again, they're not 'evolving' to cope with the colder weather; the whole mechanism is an evolved trait.\n \n Think about these butterflies in that context, and we can see that describing what they're doing as 'evolution' is over-egging the pudding to say the least. How can I be so sure? Simple: I point out that much the same basic wing-patterns arises year on year in the same seasons, on different generations of butterflies, right across the population. If they were each 'responding' intelligently and independently to the change in environment, one would hardly expect them to all pick the same response every time, hmm? :) Clearly we're seeing a mechanism at work, one that is sensitive to some environmental variation associated with the season.\n \n It would be interesting to establish exactly what their sensitivity is to by trying different ways of fooling the butterflies into thinking it was one season rather than another. Has this been done? \n \n Anyway, here's one way - entirely hypothetical, of course, and for illustrative purposes only - how this mechanism could have arisen via RM+NS:\n \n We could suppose that the 'trigger' is the amount of a certain chemical put into the egg by the parent, which varies naturally according to the food sources available at different times of the year. The quantity of this chemical introduces minor developmental differences - not, at first, anything specifically adaptive; there are simply two potential phenotypes built upon the same set of genes. Interbreeding and mutation perturbs the genotype, natural selection favours those genes with the 'better' pair of associated phenotypes, shifting the centre of peturbation, and over an extended period of time the most successful genotypes are those which achieve the striking contrast of phenotypes we observe today.\n \n I hold my hands up and repeat: this is pure speculation. I'm not asking you to accept that as an explanation. But what I will reiterate is that even if evolution proceeds by Lamarckian means, the behaviour of those butterflies would not be a poster child for it because, like the iris or the dog's winter coat, it is an example of an evolved mechanism for dealing with variation, not an on-the-fly evolutionary response. \n \n What you would need to do to show Lamarkian response is take a butterfly with no such seasonal sensitivity and show its offspring developing one very rapidly.\n \n \nthat is completely beside the point and is not applicable with cells.\n\n \n I have to say, you brought up the analogy with testicles, not me :) You said removing the ability to reproduce wasn't significant re. behaviour and used testicles as an analogy. I just pointed out that wasn't really apposite.\n \n My real point with regards to reproduction being significant is that you contend that inheritance basically bypasses genes; they're not important. Yet a cell literally cannot reproduce without those genes, and we can clone cells by transferring genetic material from one to another, and observe offspring inheriting traits thereafter. This rather suggests they are important.\n \n That said, I'd really like you to take on board the idea that Darwinists - certainly not all of them, anyway - aren't saying that 'only genes matter'. And yes, historically the perception of DNA as instructions for 'how to make an organism' did rather overlook the importance, complexity and sensitivity of the process by which those instructions were 'read' and the organism 'made'. But I think you'll find that perception has always been more public than scientific.",
