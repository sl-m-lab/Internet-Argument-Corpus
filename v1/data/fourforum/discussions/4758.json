The mind controls the body, while the soul (Atman) seeks union with the ultimate. The body and mind are but a dressing for the soul and are disposable, much like a set of clothes. The soul has the ability to influence the mind (and thus the body) through 'whispers' via successive incarnations. Eventually, or so it goes, the soul will influence the mind (and thus the body) to accumulate sufficient good Karma (\"works\") allowing the soul to unite with the ultimate.",

   "Woah, a lot of questions already...\n \n \nI welcome your thread and I agree with your proposal that, in a religion forum, it's important to come to an understanding as to the nature of various religious beliefs. Nothing but good can come from that. \n \n I have several questions for you, given that I'm but a student of Hinduism...\n \n Am I correct in saying that Hinduism recognizes a single supreme divine being taking the form of a Trinity, and that this being has many lesser manifestations within the Hindu pantheon?\n\n There is a form of the Trinity in Hinduism. However, the supreme being exists in more than just a trinity. The supreme being (Atman) actually exists in everything. The Trinity is simply a subsection of all the existences of the Atman. The Trinity of Brahma (can be considered the creator), Visnu (the preserver) and Siva (the recycler) was more formally recognized and given importance in later Hinduism though. There is mention of Visnu in the Rig Vedas (the oldest recognized script of Hinduism), but he is not regarded in the same esteem as Indra and others are.\n \nHow important is the concept of reincarnation to Hinduism? I'm not asking you to defend it, 'cause I'm already comfortable with the concept.\n\n IMHO, reincarnation is the backbone of Hinduism's cause and effect. It directly ties in with Karma, and provides a specific goal or reason to do good in life. I believe that reincarnation can be loosely interpreted as Hell, for they are both deterrants, but unlike Hell, there is no eternal damnation. I like to think of it as another try at life to improve myself.\n \nWhat role does caste play in contemporary Hinduism? \n \n\n Unfortunately, many Hindus still use the caste system in many decisions; they falsely assume that the caste system has religious origens and therefore act accordingly. However, the caste system in India had a secular political grounding before people began to misuse the system. There are many theories to the start of the Caste system. One is that many clans formed and applied strict marriage and behavioral rules among themselves. These clans then elevated to the caste system. However, I hope that Hindus eventually learn the true origen of the caste system and realize how corrupt it is.",

   "How many different god/ aspects are their in Hinduism? Which are the major gods/aspects of?\n\n I will refer to them as aspects, because IMO it better reflects their role. In Hinduism, there is one God (in the ultimate God sense). He is Brahman (not to be confused with Brahma). Brahman is the universe itself; he is everything and everything is him (pantheist theology). However, even the greatest of the aspects has trouble comprehending his existense, for Brahman is infinite. The ones that Hindus worship are aspects. They include (but not limited to :) ): Brahma, Visnu, Siva, Parvati, Lakshmi, Ganesha, Muruga, Krisna, Rama (the list goes on). Many aspects are related; they belong to a devine \"family tree\" so to say. Also, Krisna, for example, is actually Visnu incarnate. So yeah, the number of \"gods\" is big. But, Hindus are not required to worship all of them or even any of them.\n \n \nWhy is the cow a sacred animal?\n\n This is often a misconception. I wouldn't call the cow so much sacred as it is respected. In much of Hindu text, the cow is rarely mentioned, and when it is, it is usually noted for its milk producing properties. There are no cow prayers, no special idols of cows. No one prays to the cow. One researcher claims that in ancient India, cows were eaten along with other meats. Along this topic, Hinduism does not reject the eating of meat; dharmic code accepts the need for warriors and other physical laborers to eat meat to survive. Hinduism likes to promote vegetarianism because it causes less harm.\n \n \nOther then reincarnation what are some of the more basic/important tenants of Hinduism?\n\n Well, like most religions, Hinduism has a code of morals that are lay the foundation for a good life. However, Hinduism also provides a code for political/commercial gain and sensory gain. There are four ways to live life; three are \"wordly\" and one is not \"worldly\"\n Wordly Ways:\n 1) Dharma - In Hinduism, living life full of good is still of this world. To live a life of Dharma, one must do good things.\n 2) Kama - This is sensuality. Hindu texts also provide a code for how to live life for the senses. This includes drink, food, and sex.\n 3) Artha - This is a code to seek wealth. Hindu code on this subject include how to bankrupt competitors, how to crush starting companies, and etc.\n \n Not Worldly Ways:\n 1) Moksha - This is the most difficult way to live life. To live a life in persuit of moksha (salvation), one must give up all desires, including (in the biggest paradox of all) and desire to attain salvation. Few thread this path.\n \n I hope that helped?

According to Rig Veda 10.129, there is only one person who has the specific answer to who created the universe, and that his the creator himself. However, in the same passage, it is understood that even the creator must have some origen, therefore even he does not know where all of existence has come from.\n \n But, in a way, the concept of Atman closely resembles atheism. Since the ultimate truth is the universe itself, its creation is actually the creation of the universe. So, it can be said that there is no creator.\n \n However, as noted in the Rig Veda, even if the universe and Atman are one in the same, it still must have some point of origen. So, we are back to square one.\n \n Hinduism acknowledges that something must have created all that we perceive. Many Vedic scholars say that the scripts tell of Atman creating himself out of a desire to exist. Therefore, Hinduism remains pantheistic because Atman (God) is everything, and he does have a creator; himself. And with the creation of Atman, the universe came into being. To make the concept simpler, Hinduism simply calls the \"grand creator\" as Brahman. Even the Gods themselves have yet to understand where they came from.\n \n I like to equate Hindu creation with the Big Bang theory. The way I see it, Atman is the one infinitely small mass that began the universe. Atman's literaly splits into the many sub souls - some are \"gods\" some are devas (celestial good beings), asuras (celestial bad beings), some are people, some are even plants. However, all souls will eventally reunite with the Atman, only to leave it once again, thus restarting creation.\n \n It is complicated. I plan on talking with the local preist for a more indepth conversation on this very topic. I hope I will have better answers soon.",

   "I see where you didn't really address the cow and meat thing, could you address that? for me...pretty please.....\n\n \n Ok, i'll give it another shot. I don't think my first explanation was very good...\n \n It is true that the cow is considered \"Aghanya,\" or that which may not be slaughtered. However, this was a cultural devopment and not a religious one. In fact, during the time of the Vedas (well, during the time in which they were conceived), the Indus civilizations ate plenty of beef. Vegetarianism and anti-beef eating more specifically arose due the the start of Buddhism and Jainism, which condemned (mostly) the eating of meat. Also, in those days, it was cultural norm to prepare a feast of the most prized animal of your belonging (usually the stud bull) when an important guest came to visit. This practice, however, kept decreasing the quality of the herd. Therefore, to save atleast some of the herd, people rendered cows as being a taboo to eat.\n \n There are many Vedic stories which entail beef eating. In fact, there is one where five men eat an entire cow in one meal. The confusion with \"cow worship\" being in religion occured because of linguistical problems. The Vedas are written in Sanskrit, a language atleast as old as Latin and Greek, and thought by most to be even older. There are two forms of Sanskrit, Vedic Sanskrit, the Sanskrit in which the Vedas were written, and Classical Sanskrit, the Sanskrit we know today. Vedic Sanskrit is much more complicated than its classical brother (Classical Sanskrit is grammatically more difficult than Russian and German, IMO). In Vedic Sanskrit, \"goh\" means both bovine and light. Therefore, Protector of the \"Goh\" in Vedic Sanskrit actually means Protector of the Light. However, in Classical Sanskrit, \"Goh\" only means cow, giving Protector of the \"Goh\" an odd meaning. But, following Vedic Sankrit, the Protector of the \"Goh\" was not a herdsman, but actually a divine being. Similarily, there are many other Vedic stories in praise of \"Goh\" itself; thus, the myth of cow worship was born.\n \n Therefore, the \"sacredness\" of the cow was actually due to changes in cultural trends and linguistic misinterpretation, NOT as a result of religious doctrine.",

   "Judaism has the Torah, Christianity has the Bible, what other \"holy\" books do you use in your religion including the minor ones?\n\n \n There are two catagories of scripture. Shriti is that which is heard, but can be interpreted as that which is discovered. The other is Smriti, or that which is remembered or told. Shriti is considered unchangeable, because it is a record of observation. Smriti can be altered slightly to match the times. Smriti is second to Shriti; therefore, due to the times in which they are comprehended, if Smriti contradicts Shriti, Shriti is given authority. It should also be noted that moral code in Hinduism falls into Smriti; therefore, morals can change in accordance with the era in Hinduism, following the idea that people define morals.\n \n In regards to Shriti:\n \n 1) Vedas\n There are four Vedas that lay the foundation for Hinduism: The Rig Veda (the oldest scripture; relates both philosophy and hyms), Sama Veda (the Veda for hyms only. Many hyms here are duplicates of the hyms in the Rig Veda), Yajur Veda (the Veda for rituals. Describes proper ways to perform rituals), and Artharva Veda (the Veda of metaphysics. Much younger than the other Vedas).\n \n 2) Upanishads\n The philosophy in the Vedas are paraphrased in another series of scriptures, the Upanishads. Most Upanishads are in the form of a conversation between teacher and student. For example,\n \n\n 1. The Teacher says: 'If you think I know it (Brahman) well, then you know surely but little, what is that form of Brahman known, it may be, to you?'\n \n 2. The Pupil says: 'I do not think I know it well, nor do I know that I do not know it. He among us who knows this, he knows it, nor does he know that he does not know it.\n \n 3. 'He by whom it (Brahman) is not thought, by him it is thought; he by whom it is thought, knows it not. It is not understood by those who understand it, it is understood by those who do not understand it.\n \n 4. 'It is thought to be known (as if) by awakening, and (then) we obtain immortality indeed. By the Self we obtain strength, by knowledge we obtain immortality.\n \n 5. 'If a man know this here, that is the true (end of life); if he does not know this here, then there is great destruction (new births). The wise who have thought on all things (and recognised the Self in them) become immortal, when they have departed from this world.'\n \n\n \n \n In regards to Smriti\n \n 1) Epics\n The major epics in Hinduism are the Mahabharata and the Raamayanam. They both detail major wars in 'Indian history' (the truth of these epics is questionable).\n \n 2) Codes of Law\n The major code of law is \"The Law of Manu.\" However, since it is Smriti, it must be concurrent with the times to be considered truth. \"The Law of Manu\" contradicts much moral institutions of today, so it is largely disregarded.\n \n 3) Puraanas\n These are sacred romances.\n \n 4) Darshanas\n These are philosophical treatises.\n \n 5) Aagamas\n These are sectarian scriptures.",

   "I just like to mirror joebrummers comments about how interesting and enjoyable this thread is to read.\n \n 1. Human life taking - how is this approached/viewed?\n \n\n The most common source of details on murder in Hinduism is found in the \"Bhagavad Gita.\" It is part of the \"Mahabharata,\" an epic about war. In the \"Bhagavad Gita,\" Arjuna, a valiant warrior, suddenly does not wish to fight when he notices that many of his cousins and relatives are on the opposite side. He does not want to kill, and wishes to drop out of the war. His chariot driver, Krishna (an incarnation of Visnu), describes to him why he must fight the war.\n Basically, in Hinduism, when it comes to battle, the taking of a human life is not considered wrong. According to the Gita, a good warrior must follow his duty. A warrior does not take the blame for following orders. Neither does a king who must fight and kill to defend a country.\n However, a person who kills without neccesity is considered immoral. This applies even to killing animals and plants. When it is not your duty, you have no right to kill.\n But, the above falls into the catagory of Smriti, so it can change with the times.\n \n2. Can you go into more detail about these 'aspect-gods', what their nature is, their purpose in creation, what 'avatars' are specifically (more detail than physical incarnations of 'aspect-god'), their nature and purpose. Are there 'evil' aspect-gods, or are 'aspect-gods' simply as 'evil' or 'good' as any human -- a mix of good and evil.\n \n From research into Buddhism I found refference to three Hindu 'god-aspects' actually 'converting' to Buddhism and now protect some holy Buddhist scripture in another, erm, 'spiritual plane of existance'.\n \n A very fascinating concept.\n\n The 'gods' are meant to symbolize the three properties of existence; creation, maintenance, and destruction. These are personified in the Hindu Trinity of Brahma, Visnu, and Siva. Each of these 'gods' have their consorts, heavens, and progeny.\n The role of the 'gods' is to provide a personal god for those who choose. It is taught that these personal gods are simply symbols. They provide a halfway house between the physical world and Brahman. The 'gods' are only what you make them. If the high philosophy is too much for you, you can choose to pray to, let's say, Visnu. However, if your concept of religion is trying to understand the universe, you make wish to forgo the concept of Gods and just try to realize yourself.\n \n Avataaras are incarnations of Visnu. They are similar to prophets, but insteading of spreading God's words, they take physical action to save the world. Avataaras are simply part of mythology and are only what you make them to be.\n \n There are not good and bad aspects/gods. The 'gods' simply do what they are meant to do (create, perserve, destruct). There are, however, two races of celestial beings. One is the devas - a race of moral, God loving but duty neglecting (i.e. lazy) people. The other is the Asuras - evil hearted power hungry hard working brutes.\n \n There are also 14 planes of existence. According to Hinduism, the one we perceive is the 7th. The planes of existence aren't better than any other; they are just different.\n \n \n3. What is humanity's role and purpose in creation in life and after?\n\n This is much debated. Frankly, i do not know, and neither do Hindus. This is considered the ultimate question. Humanity's creation itself is not considered a big thing; we are merely the result of evolution, and, according to Hinduism, we will continue to evolve. However, the reason and method of creation is unknown, and will remain unknown.\n It is hypothosized that creation is the result of interaction between Matter and Energy. In Hinduism, Energy can become Matter and vice versa. It follows this path: Energy to Reason to Consciousness to Life to Matter. In the Prashnopanishhad, Matter and Energy are considered one in the same.\n But, all in all, we don't know why the universe was created. I refer you to Rig Veda 10.129, where it states that maybe even the creator does not know.\n \n \n4. What is 'evil', and how is it viewed in terms of it's origin and possible 'aim'?\n\n Evil is what you perceive it to be. Evil is defined by those who view. Evil's origin is its definition.\n \n The judge of evil is none other than yourself. This ties into the role of Karma. The judge of any evil act is the self, the soul. Evil deeds are noted by the sole, and bad karma is gained. This karma then affects the soul in various ways in other lives.\n \n \n5. In relation to this quote, how are such people who do not worship an 'aspect-god' viewed by other Hindus? What is the purpose and or benefit of worshiping an 'aspect-god'?\n \n Can the universe, that is to say 'Him', be communicated to (prayed to) directly (bypassing 'aspect-gods')?\n\n People who do not worship are regarded as people who do not worship. In the spiritual sense, it does not matter. (However, some families may have personal problems for whatever reason).\n \n The benefit of worship is a way to realize Brahman atleast superficially.\n \n The greatest rishis are considered thus because they do not worhip; they don't need a personal god to realize themselves.\n \n No one communicates with Brahman. It is an impersonal God. It does not care. You can try to understand it by realizing that you and it are the same.\n \n \n6. In relation to reincarnation, if the population of the Earth started with X amount of living entities, and through reproduction at some point became X+1,000,000 where did the extra souls come from?\n\n \n The extra souls can from Brahman. Brahman is like one big oversoul from which all souls came from and to which all souls will eventually go back to. Since Brahman is infinite, there is never a shortage of souls.\n \n \n I'm sorry that my answers became increasingly short. I will try to edit my reply soon and add things i may have forgotten.",

The other is the Asuras - evil hearted power hungry hard working brutes. \n\n \n Ah, I have heard of these creatures before. What are the nature of these beings? Can a human be incarnated as one or are they different from other aspects of 'life'?\n \n Do they act as servants to the 'aspect-gods' or are they simply other extra planar 'species' with civilisations in different (higher) planes to humans?\n \n \nThere are also 14 planes of existence. According to Hinduism, the one we perceive is the 7th. The planes of existence aren't better than any other; they are just different.\n\n \n Is it known why there are 14 and why our plane is the seventh?\n \n Is it possible for a human (or a part of a human like just the spirit or mind) to travel from plane to plane?\n \n Does the human body, mind, and spirit all exist in the same plane or do they exist in seperate planes and some how are 'linked'?\n \n \nBut, all in all, we don't know why the universe was created. I refer you to Rig Veda 10.129, where it states that maybe even the creator does not know.\n\n \n All very fascinating, expecially when compared with my limited knowledge of theoretical scienctific theories.\n \n \nEvil is what you perceive it to be. Evil is defined by those who view. Evil's origin is its definition.\n \n The judge of evil is none other than yourself. This ties into the role of Karma. The judge of any evil act is the self, the soul. Evil deeds are noted by the sole, and bad karma is gained. This karma then affects the soul in various ways in other lives.\n\n \n So evil, you could say, is choosing to defy your own 'nature'.\n \n \nPeople who do not worship are regarded as people who do not worship. In the spiritual sense, it does not matter. (However, some families may have personal problems for whatever reason).\n\n \n Ah perhaps where family politics become at odds with an individuals choice of living his/her chosen 'path'.\n \n \nThe greatest rishis are considered thus because they do not worhip; they don't need a personal god to realize themselves.\n \n No one communicates with Brahman. It is an impersonal God. It does not care. You can try to understand it by realizing that you and it are the same.\n\n \n I can see how Buddhism and Taoism (among others) are linked with Hinduism.\n \n \nThe extra souls can from Brahman. Brahman is like one big oversoul from which all souls came from and to which all souls will eventually go back to. Since Brahman is infinite, there is never a shortage of souls.\n\n \n I see, the concept of a 'soul well' of sorts or a indeed a meta-soul.\n \n \n \n Thank you for your time in answering my questions.",

   "Vegetarianism and anti-beef eating more specifically arose due the the start of Buddhism and Jainism, which condemned (mostly) the eating of meat. Also, in those days, it was cultural norm to prepare a feast of the most prized animal of your belonging (usually the stud bull) when an important guest came to visit. This practice, however, kept decreasing the quality of the herd. Therefore, to save atleast some of the herd, people rendered cows as being a taboo to eat.\n\n i couldnt help but liken this to the jewish practice of sacrificing animals to God for the forgiveness of sins in the old testament. the required sacrifice had to be the first born and most blemish- and defect-free of the flock, which would cause the same problem of a poorer quality generation of animals. \n \n its amazing how much misinterpretation of a passage turns into law",

   "Can you shed any light on this Hindu practice that drugs children and then buries them alive? This is clearly child abuse. \n \n In very familiar language to me are the comments posted below this news article, such as: \n \n \nWhen christians dip and nearly drown their babies in a religious ceromony called baptism no one talks for this backwardness.\n \n It is know a person can be burried alive and live for sometimes hours, but the same is not true for drowning.\n\n \n Fundamentalism is a world-wide affliction, yes?",

However, after reading the article, the headline seemed a little misleading. My first impression was that parents buried children alive and left them there. This is not the case.\n \n I am unfamiliar with the practice. I read a little on the subject, and it seems there have been no deaths due to this. However, I agree that this is a form of child abuse, since the children are drugged.\n \n I also agree with one poster on that article that the practice actually has very little relevance to Hinduism.\n \n Hopefully, though, practices like these will cease over time.",
