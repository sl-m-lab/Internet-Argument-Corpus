And conversely, just because someone has a boss doesn't mean they are liberal.\n \n All you may be saying is that there is a correlation to what people say and their beliefs. That's not much of a stretch, but actually determining what their beliefs are based on what they say is what most people do sub(un)consciously all the time.\n \n Also, most of us ASSUME another's beliefs after hearing them say this or that, but we could be dead wrong. \n \n Which (if either) do you think I am?\n \n If I had to guess, you like to think of yourself as conservative, based on the positive attributes (self-reliance) you gave to being such.

   "Is this a joke? At least for politicians, nearly ALL Republicans lean more towards conservatism,\n\n \n But what they believe is conservatism isn't true to the historical platform. Many Republicans LOVE pork, which is the anti-thesis to conservative fiscal policies, needless spending that does not serve a great purpose beyond getting them re-elected. Or how about gay marriage? Which is a major step aganist state's rights, which many conservatives say they believe, yet attack. \n \n \n\n and nearly ALL Democracts lean more towards liberalism.\n\n \n Depends. A liberal is anyone who disagrees with the rank and file notions of the Republican party. McCain is called a liberal by fellow Republicans. Liberalism is a use all term that has means nothing and everything at the same time. Support state's rights on gay marriage and you will be labeled a liberal. Attack Bush's liberal fiscal policies and you will be labeled a liberal. Attack Bush's disregard of conservative global alliances and you will be labeled a liberal. Modern liberalism bears virtually no resemblance to it's origin, and neither does Conservatism. \n \n \nTake a look. George Bush, Trent Lott, Newt Gingrich, Dick Cheney, Dick Armey, etc are ALL Republicans, and ALL lean more towards the right.\n\n \n I fail to see how Bush or Cheney do. Bush has shown in the past 3 years to be a hardcore liberal with money, (not to mention all his business ventures), not to mention shoving socialist policies left and right through congress. He's also presided over the biggest government since WWII, as well as attacking state's rights.

If profiling is a good survival instinct, does that mean you support profiling of terrorists? Maybe somewhere in all your posts you have said this\n\n \n It could be treated differently IMO because political predisposition doesn't carrry the negative and potentially criminal connotations that \"susepcted terrorist\" does. It is, of course, a natural instinct to use your \"best guess\". Stereotyping plays of this, so does, to some degree, predjudice. However, we are rational and can choose to override our instincts, and in general, I think, being \"civilized\" comes to down overriding such instincts when they do harm to society. And society defines what causes harm, it's nowhere near an absolute sort of thing.\n \n That being said, I do not know how we can NOT racially profile in some circumstances, but certainly not all situations require it. I think doing it in public...i.e. at the airport, would be less appropriate than say, doing background checks based on where you're from and if you just came to the country, etc. To be efficient, I think some forms of racial profiling are probably necessary as long as we're getting terrorized by specific nationalities and not the vast majority of others. That is, if we're having bandwidth issues on intelligence. If we aren't, then profiling is just being lazy (I suspect we have huge bandwidth issues!).\n \n -Mach",

They have achieved a level of rational thought that us simpletons could never hope to achieve, and therefore we are to turn to them for guidance. Why should a survival instinct have to be overridden..I mean, it IS for survival, isn't it? Preventing HARM to a society is more important than the SURVIVAL of a society?
