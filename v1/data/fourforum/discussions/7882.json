I have also worked with senior leaders who kicked butt. What's interesting tho - is that in addition to driving results, they were the ones that valued their employees and were loved in return. Personally I suspect it has something to do with them knowing how the work gets done. \n \n (I also wonder how many CEOs would diss the janitor if suddenly NOBODY would clean the can for them.....)\n \n In any case - I know enough about business to know that it is annoying and expensive to have to replace any employee.

That went to 100 times in the early 90's and now I believe it is reaching the 200 times mark. As an investor, I do not quite see the performance increase that such increases in salary justify. Nor do I believe that there are that many less qualified CEO's out there then in the past. Especially given the far higher level of highly educated individuals compared to 40 years ago. I believe the main problem is the executive pay commitees and the self interest that exists in determing executive pay. If increasing the pay of a specific executive in a different company is going to ( from many companies use of comparisons and averages for pay/compensation reason ) increase my own compensation I am going to be quite liberal with the bonus's and compensation packages.",
