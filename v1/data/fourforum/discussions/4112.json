   "I guess Tom Delay is next?\n \n http://www.mikehersh.com/Tom_DeLays_Ethics_Violations.shtml\n \n\"He led the partisan power grab in Texas this year to gain more Republican seats through redistricting eight years before the state was scheduled to do so. That process forced Texans to waste millions while healthcare, education and other needs went unmet. And that's just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to DeLay's pattern of abuses and disgraceful conduct.\"\n \n Other examples of DeLay's abuses in the petition include:\n \n =< DeLay obstructed justice for low-paid sweatshop workers on the island of Saipan by taking large campaign contributions from Saipan's chief lobbyist and blocking any Congressional investigation of the appalling conditions there.\n \n =< DeLay obstructed justice by lying to the FBI when he charged that the reporter who broke the Henry Hyde adultery story in the 1990s had been working with the White House to expose Hyde.\n \n =< During a deposition for a lawsuit filed by a former business partner in the pest company in 1994, DeLay lied that he had not been an officer of the company for two or three years. On congressional financial disclosure forms filed in 1995, he listed himself as chairman of the company's board of directors.\n \n =< In 1997, DeLay actually shoved Rep. David Obey [D-Wisconsin] and called him a \"chicken ****\" on the House floor. That same year, DeLay tried to impeach federal judges he didn't like.\n \n =< In 1998, DeLay said that people with \"foreign-sounding names\" probably aren't Americans.\n \n Even fellow Republicans have signed the petition asking that DeLay be removed from office, much like former U.S. Rep. James Traficant was in 2002. For example, Vicki Hill of Sugar Land, Tx., wrote: \"Thank God someone else thinks the same thing - he makes me ashamed to be a Republican.\"\n\n \n http://www.whitehouse.org/news/2004/112404.asp",
